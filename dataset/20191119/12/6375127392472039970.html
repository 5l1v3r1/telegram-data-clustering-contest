      <h3>PRESIDENT Duterte is yet to pick a new Philippine National Police chief and instead told PNP Officer-in-Charge Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa to finish the procurement of police Body-Worn Cameras or BWCs before December 10 or he will personally take over the purchase of the much-needed gadget, the Journal Group learned yesterday.</h3>
      <p>Sources present during the joint PNP-Armed Forces command conference at Malacañang Palace presided over by the Commander-in-Chief said that the President did not say anything about his choice to succeed Gen. Oscar D. Albayalde as the country’s 23d PNP chief, the third under his 3-year-old presidency.</p>
      <p>“We were waiting for such an announcement but no, the President did not make any. Instead, he asked Gen. Gamboa to finish the procurement of the body cameras by December 10 or he will take over the procurement process,” an official present during the conference told the Journal Group on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>A source close to Gen. Gamboa confirmed the information. “There was no announcement about the next PNP Chief and Gen. Gamboa will remain as the PNP-OIC until the President makes his decision. The show must go on,” the official said.</p>
      <p>During the same command conference, sources said that the President spoke on the need for the PNP and the AFP to “put humanity in your organization,” stressing the need for the police and the military to take good care of their families.</p>
      <p>The President referred to the fact that illegal drugs and communist insurgency in the country has been aided in particular by the presence of dysfunctional families.</p>
      <p>Sources said the President narrated how he was touched by the sight of a young child in Zamboanga peninsula who is under the care of a relative simply because her parents who are both in the military are assigned somewhere.</p>
      <p>The President said that in many cases, children of broken families are usually the victim of drug syndicates or the ones who are being targeted for recruitment by the New People’s Army.</p>
      <p>“Those are the reasons why President Duterte wants the police and the military organization to ‘put humanity’ in each organization. He wants policemen and soldiers who will always be with their children as long as they can,” one official said.</p>
      <p>Sources said that they were expecting the President to announce the next Chief,PNP but no, he didn’t to the surprise of his audience. Instead, he asked Gen. Gamboa whom he called ‘Archie’ to see to it that the BWC procurement will be finished before December 10 or ‘I will take over the matter.’</p>
