      <p>Cape Town - Legendary former <b>Bafana Bafana</b> captain <b>Neil Tovey </b>believes that South African-born coaches can mentor clubs in different parts around the world.</p>
      <p>The 1996 African Cup of Nations winning captain says in order for locals to coach abroad they will need to improve their skills drastically.</p>
      <p>"Everywhere in the world local coaches exist, so you must be better than them," Tovey said as quoted by <a href="https://www.kickoff.com/news/articles/south-africa-news/categories/news/premiership/neil-tovey-says-south-african-psl-coaches-must-up-their-skills-and-be-better-than-foreign-coaches/667692">KickOff</a>.</p>
      <p>"CAF are trying to equivalent our courses with the rest of the world."</p>
      <p>A handful of top tier clubs in South Africa rely on foreign coaches and Tovey says that reducing incoming mentors from abroad will not be easy but it is possible.</p>
      <p>"Why not? But it cannot be a regulation,‚Äù said the South African Football Association (SAFA) technical director when queried.</p>
      <p>"We must improve to be better and have an attitude and confidence that we are.</p>
      <p>"In some cases, there are much better than the foreigners coaching in our leagues."</p>
      <p>He added: "You can't do that, everywhere in the world in business you can't stop foreigners coming. You can't put a regulation on that.</p>
      <p>"So that's it, foreign coaches are coming all the time like we want our coaches to go overseas.</p>
      <p>"So, are you going to say now you are going to stop the technical director of Botswana, Serame Letsoaka... or Thabo Senong must not be the coach of Lesotho?"</p>
