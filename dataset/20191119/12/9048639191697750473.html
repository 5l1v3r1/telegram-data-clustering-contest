      <p><b>OUACHITA PARISH, La. (KNOE) - </b>A Ouachita Parish man has been arrested on armed robbery and battery charges after a reportedly violent trip on Interstate 20.</p>
      <p>According to court records filed in Ouachita Parish, the sheriff's office says it happened on Nov. 14, 2019. The two victims, a male and female, say they traveled to Monroe from Arkansas to visit some friends at a home on Keystone Road. They say the owner of the home, Russell Wise, was drinking heavily and asked them to take him to meet a friend at a McDonald's in Ruston.</p>
      <p>According to court documents, the victims agreed and traveled to Ruston by way of Interstate 20. Documents state Wise was sitting in the back seat while the two victims were sitting in the front.</p>
      <p>Documents state that on the trip to Ruston, one of the victims said Wise blurted out "Are y'all ready to die, because I'm ready to kill some people." The victim said that Wise then grabbed the steering wheel and jerked it to the right, almost causing them to hit an 18-wheeler.</p>
      <p>On the way back from Ruston, the victim says Wise grabbed a baseball bat from the back seat and hit the driver in the head. When the driver tried to pull over and make Wise get out, he says Wise grabbed the female by the arm, twisted it, and threatened to break it if they did not drive him all the way home. The victim also said that Wise claimed to have a pistol and would shoot them. Wise is accused of keeping the female's arm in a bind for the remainder of the 25-minute trip back to the Monroe area.</p>
      <p>Once back at Wise's home, the victims say Wise threatened to shoot them if they didn't give him all their money. After getting money from the victims, they say Wise told them that if they tried to get their belongings back, he'd kill them.</p>
      <p>Wise was arrested a few days later and charged with two counts of felony armed robbery and one count of simple battery.</p>
