      <p>Post the <i>Zero</i> debacle which led to a big break for Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, all that cine goers are expecting is for the actor to announce his next. It’s been a while and although numerous speculations have surfaced the internet, three most talked about projects have been – a film with South director Atlee Kumar, Rajkumar Hirani’s next and Ali Abbas Zafar’s action flick. Now, looks like SRK is going to be a part of all three after all.</p>
      <p>While it was being said that Rajkumar Hirani was a reliable option for Shah Rukh Khan who seemed to be deeply affected by <i>Zero’s</i> failure at the box office, it was Atlee Kumar’s script that grabbed his eyeballs. But now, if rumours are to be believed, the actor has said yes to all the three speculated films.</p>
      <p>A source close to Pinkvilla reveals the same as, “It seems that Shah Rukh has loved all the three scripts and will do all of them, one by one. Raju has already locked SRK’s dates from April 2020 for his movie and that’s happening rightaway. If all goes well, he might even have a big release next year itself.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, SRK will also be seen in a cameo in Ranbir Kapoor-Alia Bhatt-Amitabh Bachchan’s <i>Brahmastra</i>. A picture from the sets have been going viral on the internet and has left the fans elated. Of course, even though for a small rolle, one gets to witness the actor on the big screen, but we further only await him in a full-fledged role on the big screen.</p>
