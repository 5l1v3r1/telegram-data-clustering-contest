      <h1>Christmas cheer: seven cocktails from Mr Lyan</h1>

        <i>Port and pony for a party, apple seed punch for the abstainers and a bloody Claus for a pre-lunch sharpener</i>
      </p>
      <p>These drinks are reflective of the season; flavours reminiscent of the aromas, nostalgia and comforting dishes that pervade the holiday time. They’re also drinks designed to suit the various gatherings that crop up. Some work for impromptu drop-ins. Others are for when you need the right cocktail to accompany the multitude of indulgences that adorn the Christmas table.</p>
      <p>There’s also a consideration for the fact that the holidays also seem to spur a little extra waste in all our lives, so I’ve tried to balance this by using some ingredients that curb the impact on the planet, or are getting used across the table anyway. As with cooking, a little prep ahead of time makes a world of difference – and, as with your cooking, please use these as a guide and adapt as necessary. Happy gathering!</p>
      <h3>Apple seed punch</h3>
      <p>Cater to your wee ones or those who are abstaining with this punch. It lacks loads of sticky additions, so works for all palates. It is also great gently warmed for a hearty welcome from the cold.</p>
      <p><i><b>Serves 8-10 people<br/></b></i><b>Seedlip Garden 108</b> 200ml<br/><b>Seedlip Grove 42</b> 100ml<br/><b>spiced honey water</b> 100ml (see directions below)<br/><b>cloudy apple juice</b> 500ml<br/><b>elderflower cordial</b> 50ml<br/><b>soda water</b> 500ml, chilled<br/><b>lemon ice</b> (see directions below)<br/><b>pink grapefruit </b>1, cut into wedges<br/><b>lemon thyme</b> several sprigs</p>
      <p>To make the spiced honey water, boil 300ml of water and add 3g of loose-leaf earl grey tea, 1 crushed green cardamom pod and 1 clove. Allow to cool, then strain and mix 100ml of the liquid into 100g of honey.</p>
      <p>To make the lemon ice, slice a lemon into wheels. Put into an ice-cream tub and fill with boiling water. Allow to cool then freeze overnight.</p>
      <p>To serve, add the lemon ice to a punch bowl or soup urn, then add the Seedlips, honey water, apple juice and elderflower. Stir well, then add the soda water. Serve in rocks glasses with ice, and garnish with the wedges of pink grapefruit and sprigs of lemon thyme. An ideal boozeless single serve, this is something to refresh in among the busyness. It has a great depth of spice, and is pleasingly bittersweet.</p>

      <p>This is ideal for a toast when friends drop by. It’s easy to have a batch sitting waiting, then simply pop open some bubbles (stick with something made <i>method</i><i>e </i><i>champenoise</i> – prosecco lacks the requisite bubbles, acidity or nuttiness). Pick a garnish as suits. Rosemary and citrus peels are perfectly festive.</p>
      <p><i><b>Serves 8-10 people<br/></b></i><b>VS </b><b>cognac</b> 200ml<br/><b>creme de </b><b>mures</b> (blackberry liqueur) 300ml<br/><b>Seedlip Spice 94</b> 50ml<br/><b>water</b> 150ml<br/><b>Angostura orange bitters</b> 10 hefty dashes (or regular Angostura)<br/><b>sparkling wine </b>2 bottles, chilled</p>
      <p>To prepare, mix all the ingredients together in a jug. Decant into a bottle, and chill well.</p>
      <p>To serve, add 50ml to a coupette or flute, then top with sparkling wine, and garnish to taste.</p>
      <h3>Hot orange wine</h3>

      <p>Orange wine (the white grape cousin to rosé) offers a unique texture and florality that suits this drink perfectly.</p>
      <p>Without the richer tannins of a deep red, this “mulled” drink is both comforting and uplifting.</p>
      <p><i><b>Serves 8-10 people<br/></b></i><b>lemon</b> 1<br/><b>clementines</b> 2<br/><b>bouquet garni</b> (see below)<br/><b>caster sugar </b>150g<br/><b>sloe gin</b> 200ml<br/><b>orange wine</b> 2 bottles<br/><b>nutmeg</b></p>
      <p><i><b>For the bouquet garni</b></i><br/><b>fresh rosemary</b> 1 sprig, cut into thirds<br/><b>black cardamom pod</b> 1, crushed<br/><b>fresh ginger</b> a thumb, unpeeled but washed, chopped<br/><b>cloves</b> 3<br/><b>pink grapefruit peel </b>1 strip, pith removed<br/><b>fennel seeds</b> 1 tsp<br/><b>fresh bay leaf</b> 1<br/><b>Sri Lankan cinnamon stick</b> 2cm (if unavailable use a regular cinnamon stick)<br/><b>rooibos tea leaves</b> ½ tsp</p>
      <p>To make the bouquet garni, wrap all the ingredients in a piece of muslin.</p>
      <p>Slice the lemon and the clementines. Add to a saucepan with 300ml of boiling water, the bouquet garni, and the caster sugar.</p>
      <p>Place on a low heat, then add the sloe gin and orange wine. Heat on the lowest heat possible for 30 minutes then remove the bouquet garni.</p>
      <p>Serve in pre-warmed teacups with a fresh grating of nutmeg.</p>

      <p><i><b>Makes 1<br/></b></i><b>cold-brewed green tea</b> 50ml<br/><b>flat-leaf parsley</b> 1 sprig<br/><b>Everleaf non-alcoholic bittersweet aperitif</b> 40ml<br/><b>ginger ale</b> 100ml, chilled <br/><b>lime wedges</b> to garnish</p>
      <p>To make the cold-brewed green tea, add 3g of loose green tea leaves to 500ml cold water, and infuse in the fridge for 12 hours. Strain and keep chilled.</p>
      <p>To serve, wrap the parsley sprig around the inside of a wine glass and fill with large cubes of ice. Add the Everleaf and tea and stir gently. Add more ice, then top with ginger ale, and garnish with a wedge of lime.</p>
      <h3>Panettone hot chocolate</h3>

      <p>I love the spiced cakes of Christmas but there are always too many for any sensible consumption. This makes use of the leftover panettone that has begun to dry, but should definitely not be destined for the bin. The booze works great, but can be omitted.</p>
      <p>The proportion of milk to panettone is to taste, but around a litre of milk to about 300g of stale panettone is probably the best guide.</p>
      <p><i><b>Makes 1<br/></b></i><b>spiced milk</b> 100ml (see below)<br/><b>good dark chocolate</b> 30g, grated<br/><b>unrefined sugar </b>1 tsp<br/><b>yellow chartreuse</b> 15ml<br/><b>London dry gin</b> 15ml</p>
      <p><i><b>For the spiced milk<br/></b></i><b>milk</b> 1 litre<br/><b>salt</b> a pinch<br/><b>stale panettone</b> 300g</p>
      <p>To make the spiced milk, gently warm a pan of milk, then add a pinch of salt, and leftover cake.</p>
      <p>Keep on a very low heat for 15 minutes, then strain out the cake crumbs.</p>
      <p>If you’re feeling very energetic, the crumbs can be spread onto a baking tray, sprinkled in sugar, and baked on a very low heat for a “snap” as a garnish.</p>
      <p>Gently heat 100ml of the spiced milk with the grated chocolate and sugar, then pour into a cup with the chartreuse and gin.</p>
      <h3>Port and pony</h3>

      <p>A warming and aromatic drink that’s perfect when you need to serve a group. Pro tip: this also works amazingly as a theatrical hot punch. Omit the lemon ice, but add a sliced fresh lemon to the mix, then clean a poker, warm in the embers of the fire, then as guests arrive, plunge the red hot “loggerhead” into the bowl (avoid touching the sides and wear a glove to avoid burns and a spitting cocktail). It will caramelise and warm in a way heating on the hob just won’t do.</p>
      <p><i><b>Serves 8-10 people<br/></b></i><b>orange</b> 1<br/><b>cinnamon sugar<br/>lemon ice</b> (see apple seed punch recipe on page 61)<br/><b>celery</b> 1 stick, shaved into ribbons<br/><b>spiced honey water</b> 100ml (see apple seed punch recipe<br/><b>tawny port</b> 500ml<br/><b>Empirical Spirits </b><b>Fallen Pony</b> 300ml (or use pear brandy, vodka or light rum)<br/><b>ginger ale</b> 500ml, chilled</p>
      <p>Slice the orange into wheels. Dust in cinnamon sugar then bake in a low oven for 6 hours until dried into crisps.</p>
      <p>When ready to serve, place the lemon ice in a punch bowl or soup tureen, then add the celery shavings, honey water, port and Fallen Pony. Stir well, then add the chilled ginger ale. Serve in teacups with ice, and garnish with an orange crisp.</p>
      <h3>Bloody Claus</h3>

      <p>This might not seem the most Christmassy of drinks, but it is ideal when the night’s indulgences have caught up, or for when family and friends are gathering for the many lunch feasts. With that in mind, the base is easily prepped ahead of time, then poured as guests arrive.</p>
      <p><i><b>Serves 6<br/></b></i><b>white miso</b> 1 tbsp<br/><b>good tomato juice</b> 700ml<br/><b>passata</b> 300ml<br/><b>clementine juice</b> 200ml<br/><b>Worcestershire sauce</b> 100ml<br/><b>port</b> 100ml<br/><b>single malt whisky</b> 50ml (a peaty, smokey Islay such as Ardbeg is best)<br/><b>Tabasco</b> to taste<br/><b>vodka</b> 50ml</p>
      <p><i><b>To garnish<br/></b></i><b>pickled chilli</b> 1<br/><b>celery</b> 1 stick</p>
      <p>Dissolve the white miso in boiling water in the base of a pitcher, then add all the ingredients except the vodka.</p>
      <p>To serve, put the vodka in a highball glass filled with ice. Top with the tomato mixture and stir. Add more ice, then garnish with a pickled chilli and a stick of celery. Avoid the urge to stack it with a fruit basket of garnishes – lunch is on its way.</p>
