        <b>Luis Enrique, whose daughter died from bone cancer in August, is returning as Spain manager five months after stepping down for personal reasons.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Enrique resigned in June after 11 months in the job and announced in August that his nine-year-old daughter, Xana, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49518049">had died.</a></p>
      <p>The 49-year-old former Barcelona boss was replaced by his assistant, Robert Moreno.</p>
      <p>Moreno was in charge as Spain beat Romania 5-0 on Monday.</p>
      <p>It saw Spain wrap up <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50467133">qualification for Euro 2020</a> without losing a game.</p>
      <p>Moreno, who also worked under Enrique at Roma, Celta Vigo and Barcelona, said after taking the job he would "step aside" if Enrique ever wanted to return.</p>
      <p>At a news conference on Tuesday, Spanish Football Federation president Luis Rubiales said: "Everyone knew that if Luis Enrique wanted to come back he had the doors open.</p>
      <p>"Luis Enrique will continue to the Qatar World Cup [in 2022]."</p>
      <p>Enrique was appointed national team boss following Spain's exit from the 2018 World Cup in the last 16.</p>
      <p>He was in charge for the Nations League, where Spain failed to reach the semi-finals, and remained in place for the beginning of their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard travelled back home for personal reasons before Spain's 2-0 victory in Malta in March and Moreno was placed in temporary charge.</p>
      <p>Enrique then stepped down three months later.</p>
