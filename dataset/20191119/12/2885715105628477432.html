      <h1>Bigg Boss 13 wild card Himanshi Khurana: I don’t need to take advantage of Shehnaaz Gill’s popularity</h1>
      <h2>While Himanshi Khurana is safe this week, the nominated contestants include Sidharth Shukla, Rashami Desai, Devoleena Bhattacharjee, Arti Singh and Khesari Lal Yadav.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:30:38+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/sana-farzeen/" target="_blank">Sana Farzeen</a></address>
      <p>Himanshi Khurana entered Bigg Boss 13 with a bang. Her presence led to an emotional outburst by Shehnaaz Gill, as the two share an ugly past. As already revealed by the two ladies, their social media criticism developed into a major fight, with both of them also abusing each other’s family.</p>
      <p>While the issue hasn’t been resolved yet, Himanshi and Shehnaaz have been civil to each other, though they are yet to become friends. But interestingly, in last night’s episode, we saw Shehnaaz saving Himanshi from nomination.</p>
      <p>Before entering the show, Himanshi spoke to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a> about deciding to live with her rival under the same roof. When asked what made her take the offer, Himanshi said, “The controversy involving Shehnaaz and me had garnered national attention. I think this is why I got approached by the makers. The world wants to know the reality, and I hope through this show, people know what the truth is. Also, she might be showing a side of Punjab that many wouldn’t even relate to. I can project the real Punjabis to the audience.”</p>
      <p>Himanshi has been accused of taking advantage of Shehnaaz’s popularity. The singer-actor said, “Why would I need to take advantage of her popularity? I have been working in the industry for 10 years, and I collaborate with only A-listers. Also, if you look at our social media following, you would know who is more popular in real. Also, not everyone can handle fame, I am mature enough to be grounded.”</p>

      <p>Sharing that she would be open to being friends with Shehnaaz, Himanshi said, “I am someone who can work with colleagues, whom I am not even in talking terms with. So it doesn’t really matter if she is around or not. But in case we do get a chance, I would forgive her if she apologises to my family on national television.’</p>
      <p>The actor also said that she is quite excited about me meeting host <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/salman-khan/">Salman Khan</a>. “I adore him, and just the fact that I will get to meet him every week makes me really excited.”</p>
      <p>In the show, we saw Himanshi ignoring Asim Riaz’s flirtatious approach in one of the tasks. When we asked her if she would be open to having a relationship on the show, she said, “I am already in love, and there’s nothing that can affect my bond with my man. It won’t happen for sure.”</p>
      <p>While Himanshi is safe this week, the nominated contestants include Sidharth Shukla, Rashami Desai, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/devoleena-bhattacharjee">Devoleena Bhattacharjee</a>, Arti Singh and Khesari Lal Yadav.</p>
