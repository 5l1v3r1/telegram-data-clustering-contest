      <h3>THE Quezon City prosecutor’s office yesterday junked the libel complaint filed against Rappler’s Maria Ressa and reporter Rambo Talabong by Agrarian Reform Secretary John Castriciones for lack of probable cause.</h3>
      <p>“The statements made by respondents in their online website are not in (themselves) defamatory,” Assistant City Prosecutor Arnel Pabellar said in a resolution.</p>
      <p>Citing Yabut and Tamargo vs Office of the Ombudsman, the resolution said: “A public official, more especially an elected one, should not be onion-skinned…Always, he is expected to act and serve with the highest degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, and shall remain accountable for his counduct to the people.”</p>
      <p>In 2017, Castriciones filed the libel complaint as undersecretary of the Interior and Local Government Department.</p>
      <p>Rappler reported that Castriciones along with two other DILG undersecretaries were divested of their powers by then DILG secretary Ismael Sueno in 2017.</p>
      <p>Also, concerned DILG officials and employees sent a letter to President Duterte asking him to fire Castriciones and the other undersecretaries.</p>
      <p>However, the President did not fire them and just transferred them to other offices.</p>
      <p>The public Quezon City prosecutor ruled there was no libel because Rappler “merely summarized the contents of the letter to the President’ without any remarks or comment.”</p>
