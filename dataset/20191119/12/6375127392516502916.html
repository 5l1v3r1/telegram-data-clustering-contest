      <h3>PHILIPPINE National Police Officer-in-Charge Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa on Monday said it would be good for Vice President Leni Robredo to focus on improving the government’s advocacy and rehabilitation program when it comes to fighting drugs and just leave the arrest and prosecution of offenders to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, the PNP and the Department of Justice.</h3>
      <p>According to the PNP-OIC, they will follow the lead of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency headed by Director General Aaron N. Aquino  on the Vice President’s request to have access to the list of “high-value targets” or HVTs.</p>
      <p>“Remember, the PDEA is the head of the law enforcement cluster... Whatever the head says, I will always respect it being a member of the law enforcement... So yes, I adhere to what the Director General says,” Gamboa told newsmen at Camp Crame after unveiling part of the over P3 billion worth of newly-procured police equipment including helicopters, patrol vehicles, machine guns and pistols.</p>
      <p>Lt. Gen. Gamboa pointed out that the Vice-President, being Aquino’s co-chairperson of the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs (ICAD), should focus on the drug war’s aspect of advocacy and rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>“Would it really matter who are on the list? Kaya nga palagi naming sinasabi... ako ha I’m already suggesting na anyway the entire ICAD is composed of four different sub-committees,” he pointed out.</p>
      <p>“Why would the VP not take the advocacy and the rehabilitation? Pasok ‘yung sinasabi niya, the illegal drugs is actually a health problem so probably that can fall under advocacy and rehabilitation,” he added.</p>
      <p>Gen. Gamboa also said that the law enforcement and prosecution aspect of the government’s anti-illegal drugs should be left to the PNP, PDEA as well as the National Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice.</p>
