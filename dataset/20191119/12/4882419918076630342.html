      <h1>Madrid consensus against Gareth Bale</h1>
      <h2>His lack of commitment to the club is the reason for the unhappiness</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:57:20+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:57</time> by <a rel="author">Alejandro Alc√°zar</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Bale is in another sticky situation at Real Madrid. His latest comments have gone down like a jug of cold water. He said he's more excited to play for Wales than Madrid and it might be the straw that broke the camel's back. Everyone at Madrid wants him to go, most of the board, some team-mates and above all, the fans.</p>
      <p>This lack of commitment can be felt on the pitch, where he doesn't take a lot of risks, which he does throw himself into when playing for his country. He breaks easily and protects himself for the games he considers important.</p>
      <p>Bale's stay at Madrid is not cheap. He's the best paid player in the squad. He doesn't fit in with the other players, to one side of the dressing room. Only president Florentino Perez's support has kept him at Madrid this long. Zidane, however, will keep counting on him on the pitch when he can.</p>
