      <p>David Fincher is set to pen a pilot script for a sequel series of <i>Chinatown</i> on <a href="http://nme.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a>.</p>
      <p>The classic film came out in 1974, and the sequel will see Fincher teaming up with Robert Towne.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>As <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/chinatown-prequel-series-pilot-robert-towne-david-fincher-netflix-1202789041/"><i>Deadline</i></a> report, Fincher and Towne are set to write a pilot script for a sequel series for the Oscar-winning film that will focus on a young version of Jake Gittes (who Jack Nicholson played in the original) navigating a town full of corruption.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear yet whether Fincher will end up directing the pilot, as the deal he and Towne have signed with Netflix only stretches to writing the script at this point.</p>

      <p>Fincher’s work on <i>Chinatown</i> will follow his work directing <i>House of Cards</i>, which saw him become one of the first A-list Hollywood film makers to turn his attention to producing for TV, and <i>Mindhunter</i>, which launched its second series on Netflix back in August.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/tv-blogs/mindhunter-s02e01-netflix-btk-killer-dennis-rader-strangler-holden-ford-new-2539211">Writing about the opening of the second season of <i>Mindhunter</i></a>, which saw Fincher return to the director’s chair, NME’s Christopher Hooton wrote: “Fincher was the architect of the show’s neutral style, which views events with not so much a gaze as a blank stare. We settle back into this in episode 1, along with that familiar yellowish colour grade, evoking mustard stained shirts, acrid fumes and nausea.”</p>
