      <h1>The East Midlands' most dog-friendly pub is in Nottingham</h1>
      <h2>There's beds, treats behind the bar and a secure garden area</h2>

      <p>The Lion at Basford has been crowned the most dog-friendly pub across the whole of the East Midlands for the second year in a row.</p>
      <p>It received the most public votes in a tough competition attracting more than 210 pubs in the region.</p>
      <p>Renowned as a great pit stop after a nice long dog-walk, the pub is hailed for its welcoming approach, and dog amenities, including beds, a secure garden space and treats behind the bar.</p>
      <p>Rosamund Powditch, manager of pub in Mosley Street, was delighted with the news.</p>
      <p>She said: "Being dog friendly means creating an environment that is welcoming to our customers with and without their doggy family members in tow. We know that guests would rather not leave their dog at home on their own longer than is necessary and so we want to make it easy and enjoyable for them to bring their pooch out with them.</p>
      <p>“It's our customers continual support and enthusiasm for our dog friendly approach that has allowed us not only to win this award again, but create an amazing environment for all our doggy customers.”</p>

      <p>The Dog-friendly Pub Awards, run by Rover.com, the world’s largest network of pet sitters and dog walkers, celebrates pubs with dog-friendly initiatives and encourages pubs across the country to welcome four legs as well as two.</p>
      <p>Just pipped to the post, in second and third place, are The Chequers Inn, in Ilkeston, and Six Barrel Drafthouse in Nottingham. The Frame Brakers in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/breastfeeding-mum-told-leave-speed-3549668">Ruddington</a> came seventh.</p>
      <p>Simon Le Grice, from Rover, said: “The East Midlands has a fantastic array of dog-friendly pubs for locals to choose from. It’s been wonderful to see so many of them represented in this year’s awards. The community has really got behind their favourite pubs and helped us, for the fourth year running, to find the best of the bunch - and with The Lion at Basford in Nottingham, we’ve found just that.</p>
      <p>“The superb service they demonstrated shows a real consideration for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/uk-world-news/top-10-dog-names-2020-3460493">dog</a> welfare and happiness, which we at Rover value above all. The whole Rover pack is proud to congratulate The Lion at Basford on winning the Dog-friendly Pub Award for the East Midlands and hopes that the awards will inspire dog owners country-wide to discover and support their local pubs, while also encouraging more pubs to consider our two-legged friends in their offerings.”</p>
