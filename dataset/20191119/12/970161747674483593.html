        <b>EastEnders star Jake Wood has revealed that he and his wife Alison have adoped some battery hens – with one of them being named after Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan. Alison shared video footage on Twitter ofthe rescued chickens and one of them was brought back from the brink of death as they heated it with hairdryers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking to Piers on Good Morning Britain, the Max Branning star – who also presents wildly popular podcast Pound For Pound – said: ‘We’ve adopted some chickens, who are battery hen chickens.</p>
      <p>‘They don’t have many feathers because they’ve been living inside. We had a tragedy yesterday. We lost one of the chickens. The other two are not very well, so we’ve taken them indoors.’</p>
      <p>Using a hairdryer shaped like the face of Piers Morgan, Jake managed to save the chicken and has now honoured the presenter by naming the chicken after him. It’s enough to bring a tear to the eye!</p>

      <p>He added: ‘They needed heating up so we used the Morgan 3000, and now they’ve both come back to life. That one is now called Piers.’</p>
