      <h1>The massive acts Bristol is missing out on without an arena</h1>
      <h2>There is some world-renowned talent going on tour in the new year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:25:58+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:25</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Murray</a></address>
      <p>There's a good reason Bristol has long been seen as one of the best cities in the UK for live music.</p>
      <p>The city is home to plenty of fantastic small and mid-size venues including Thekla, Exchange, The Louisiana, The Fleece and Trinity Centre.</p>
      <p>But with no arena we miss out on the large-scale gigs other major UK cities enjoy on a regular basis - although <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/ashton-gate-stadium-concerts-2020-3540573">Ashton Gate has gone some way to filling the void</a>, and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/news-opinion/filton-arena-could-become-redundant-3430258">The Downs has been touted as a suitable option</a> by a property expert.</p>
      <p>The home of Bristol City aside and excluding Colston Hall, which is <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/colston-hall-becomes-first-concert-3385684">currently undergoing a transformation</a>, the largest venue we have is the O2 Academy, which has a capacity of 1,800.</p>
      <p>Although it does attract household names, it isn't big enough to host the world's most popular artists, who understandably opt for arenas elsewhere instead.</p>

      <p>Today (November 19), international construction company <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/filton-arena-plans-ytl-bristol-3551372">YTL has revealed its latest plans to develop the city’s arena</a> on the site of the Brabazon hangars on the former Filton airfield.</p>
      <p>If given the green light the site will welcome a 17,000 capacity arena, which would rank it among the UK's biggest indoor venues.</p>
      <p>For context Manchester Arena, the biggest indoor arena in the UK, has a capacity of 21,000, Arena Birmingham has a capacity of 16,000, the Liverpool Echo Arena can fit 11,000 people in while Cardiff Motorpoint Arena has space for 7,500 people.</p>
      <p>Bristol has had dalliances with arena plans before, but they never seem to come to fruition. We have taken a look at some of the incredible live acts currently, or about to go, on a UK arena tour to see the big names Bristol could attract if the arena goes ahead.</p>

      <h3>The 1975</h3>
      <p>Led by Matt Healey, the 1975's debut album reached number one in the UK charts in 2013 thanks to the likes of hit singles Sex, Chocolate and Robbers.</p>
      <p>Since then they have seen their fan base grow massively across the globe and their sophomore album, released in 2016, reached number one not only in the UK but the US too.</p>
      <p>The quartet are currently touring America but are set for a string of UK arena dates early next year at venues including the First Direct Arena in Leeds, Cardiff's Motorpoint Arena and Manchester Arena.</p>
      <h3>The Chemical Brothers</h3>
      <p>The Chemical Brothers are well known for their incredible live show, which sees their vast back catalogue of hits combine with mind-blowing visuals to create a spectacle to remember.</p>
      <p>Although they performed at Bristol's Motion in 2017, this was only a DJ set and there is nowhere in the city big enough to accommodate the duo's live show.</p>
      <p>They are now on the verge of embarking on a UK arena tour in Leeds, Manchester, Glasgow, Cardiff, Birmingham and London. Considering how much Bristol likes a rave, it's a shame the city is incapable of hosting the party-starting stalwarts...</p>
      <h3>Elton John</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Next year, one of the best-selling artists of all time will embark on a sprawling world tour to mark the end of his glittering career.</p>
      <p>Ever since hit single Rocket Man began a run of 16 consecutive top 20 hit singles in 1972, Elton John has been an international music superstar.</p>
      <p>His full farewell tour will consist of more than 300 shows across five continents, set to reach its end in 2021, but Bristol will not be included on the journey due to its lack of arena. Shame.</p>
      <h3>Little Mix</h3>
      <p>Pop superstars Little Mix, who formed during the eighth series of The <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/x-factor-tv-start-date-269629?service=responsive">X Factor</a> in 2011, have gone on to enjoy huge success.</p>
      <p>They are one of the best-selling girl groups of all time having shifted 50 million records worldwide, and their most recent album LM5 has enjoyed mostly positive reviews.</p>
      <p>To celebrate the release of the album the four-piece are currently in the midst of a major UK tour, which kicked off at Dublin's 3Arena on October 10 and ends at the First Direct Arena in Leeds tonight (November 19).</p>
      <h3>Craig David</h3>
      <p>Southampton-born Craig David has enjoyed over 15 million albums sold worldwide and multiple Grammy nominations.</p>
      <p>The contemporary RnB singer-songwriter, rapper and international pop sensation has released seven studio albums, with the latest, The Time Is Now, released in January 2018.</p>
      <p>Next year he will embark on his latest UK tour, including performances at Arena Birmingham, Motorpoint Arena in Nottingham and the First Direct Arena in Leeds.</p>
