      <h3>Climate change no longer a problem</h3>
      <p>At last, climate change will no longer be a problem. No more preoccupied mass hysteria from the doomsday sayers.</p>
      <p>Why? Once Trudeau has completely decimated the Canadian economy with disastrous agricultural trade missions and disastrous resource sector policies and insurmountable debt through deficit budgeting, our only preoccupation will be trying to afford the very basic necessities of life.</p>

        <b>The West must work with our government</b>
      </p>
      <p>Most people and especially politicians know that negatives win votes.</p>
      <p>For a number of months prior to the election, negatives were spewed. It worked so well that the West voted one way, but failed to send any representatives to Ottawa, nor to elect the leader to be prime minister.</p>
      <p>Now the West wants Ottawa to work for them, to achieve what they want.</p>
      <p>Shouldn’t that be that the West works with Ottawa?</p>
      <p>In any case, it is hoped that success will be achieved in whatever is demanded.</p>

        <b>Debates intended to be fairly represented</b>
      </p>
      <p>It has been brought to our attention that an Oct. 8 article in The StarPhoenix (<a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/liberal-ndp-candidates-unhappy-about-conservative-skipping-debates">Liberal, NDP candidates unhappy about Conservative skipping debates</a>) states that Corey Tochor did not attend the 100 Debates on the Environment event in Saskatoon-University on Oct. 3, locally organized by the Saskatchewan Environmental Society, because “the organizers of the environment debate had endorsed candidates, making it a ‘foregone conclusion.’ ”</p>
      <p>For the record, the Saskatchewan Environmental Society did not endorse any candidates. The event’s national partner, GreenPac, did endorse 16 candidates including some Conservatives, but none in the Saskatoon-University riding.</p>
      <p>We sent repeated invitations to Mr. Tochor for the debate, clearly indicating that it was planned as a non-partisan event. Mr. Tochor did not respond to any of our invitations, nor did he indicate that he had scheduling conflicts on the evening of the event or that he had concerns about the event.</p>
      <p>It is unfortunate that he did not participate in the debate. It was well attended, the audience was very respectful and all candidates had equal opportunities to state their positions.</p>

        <b>City of Saskatoon flag poles</b>
      </p>
      <p>Let’s just get rid of the flag poles. And, sooner would be better than later, before there is another new department with numerous new people hired at city hall to deal with the issue of which flag is deemed suitable and which is not.</p>
      <p>There are more serious issues to be dealt with by our city than flags.</p>

        <b>Political statement negates claim</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the Nov. 4 StarPhoenix, Sean Polreis states that The StarPhoenix is “… <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/opinion/letters/letters-to-the-editor-nov-4">no place for political agenda</a>” and in his second paragraph he makes quite the political statement saying, “… a politician I personally did not want as prime minister.”</p>
      <p>Sean, that’s quite the “political“ statement you made there.</p>
