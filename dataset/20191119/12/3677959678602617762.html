      <p>A new mod has been released for Pokemon Sword And Shield, introducing some visuals improvements to the game.</p>
      <p><a href="https://gamebanana.com/textures/5654">The new mod</a>, which can only be used on hacked consoles or by playing the game on the Yuzu PC emulator, introduces hi-res trees to the Wild Area. The tree models look quite bad in the regular games, so this mod makes a very welcome change.</p>

      <blockquote>A mod that literally took me an hour to make.<br/>Shoutouts toÂ MattsCreativeInc for the texture and thanks to BSOD Gaming for the screenshots!<br/>Also special thanks to theboy181 for helping out!<br/><b><u>Installation Instructions</u></b><br/>For Switch: Simply drag &amp; drop the "atmosphere" folder in the root of your SD card, boot the console into CFW, then boot the game, and the mod will be active!<br/>For yuzu: Simply rename the "0100ABF008968000" folder to "Trees" and place it in "C:\Users\{You}\AppData\Roaming\yuzu\load\0100ABF008968000\". Restart yuzu and boot up the game!</blockquote>
      <p>The Pokemon modding community has always been very active, but it seems like it is even more active for Pokemon Sword and Shield. <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield-missing-pokemon-modders/">Yesterday</a>, we have reported that a modder started adding missing Pokemon to the new games using the models from the Let's Go games. With some additional work, they can become fully functional.</p>
