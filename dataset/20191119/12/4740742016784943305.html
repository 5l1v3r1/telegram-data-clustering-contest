      <h1>Deed showing lewd 13th Century street name in Bristol up for sale</h1>
      <h2>The deed is one of the earliest examples of the rude place name</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:08:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:08</time> by <a rel="author">Rod Minchin</a></address>
      <p>A 13th century deed of a crudely offensive place name is to be sold at auction.</p>
      <p>The deed is one of the earliest examples of Gropec*** Lane and is being sold by the family of a deceased collector from Bristol.</p>
      <p>It was a compounded street name found in about 20 English towns and cities in medieval times and is believed to be a reference to organised prostitution.</p>
      <p>The earliest reference to the lewd street name is from 1230 in Oxford and the Bristol example being sold is dated 1240.</p>
      <p>The street was later changed to Hallier's Lane and after the Battle of Trafalgar was renamed Nelson Street, which it remains today.</p>
      <p>The deed was written in Latin on vellum and is mounted on a wooden board. It comes with three related 20th-century manuscript paper labels.</p>
      <p>It will go under the hammer on December 11 at Dominic Winter Auctioneers in Cirencester, Gloucestershire and is estimated to fetch up to £500.</p>

      <p>Auctioneer Chris Albury said: "This was taken off the wall of a deceased Bristol collector recently.</p>
      <p>"The family knew it was an old Bristol deed but it was only when I looked at it closely and clearly saw the place name that I realised why the collector probably treasured it and it seems it was a private joke he kept from his family.</p>
      <p>"Besides the amusement factor, it is historically important as early documented usage of this place name and it will be of great interest to other collectors from Bristol and worldwide.</p>
      <p>"Even with medieval deeds condition is a major factor in value and saleability so a high value is not a given.</p>
      <p>"This one is very neatly written in a court hand, the ink is still very dark and about one-third of the original wax seal survives so it is better than many.</p>
      <p>"The fact that it relates to a major city like Bristol will help, but the rude place name may well make this fly beyond the £500 estimate we've put on it."</p>
