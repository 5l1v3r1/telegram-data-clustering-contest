      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:59:02+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:59</time> by <a rel="author">Koimoi.com Team</a></address>
      <p>Bhaskar Hazarika’s highly acclaimed Assamese film which is produced by Anurag Kashyap in Hindi – <i>Aamis</i> will release on Nov 22nd 2019 with a unique release strategy.</p>
      <p>MovieSaints, the company releasing Aamis, is a Distribution Solutions Provider that combines a strategic theatrical with a unique online release model to bring curated independent films to the maximum possible audience on the same day.</p>
      <p>Explaining the new release model, Rishiraj, Founder CEO, MovieSaints says, “I wanted to create a system that reduces the risk for the viewer while allowing filmmakers to make money based on the quality of their work. On moviesaints.com users pay a certain amount (say ₹ 99) to rent a film. If viewers like the film, the money goes to support the filmmaker (if they really like the film, they can also give more money). But if viewers don’t like the film, they can give their critical feedback to the filmmaker and get a refund (minus a small platform fee, usually ₹30).”</p>

      <p>“Viewers can also take advantage of our Screens-on-Demand model to request a big-screen release in their vicinity, and the team at MovieSaints will work to bring the movie to them on the big screen. We also work with local distributors to release the film as widely as possible in the local territory,” he adds.</p>
      <p>Adding to it CEO Rishiraj says, “A good film will have good word-of-mouth, and without large marketing budgets, it is extremely important that this word-of-mouth is efficiently utilized. The simultaneous online and offline model ensures that everyone is watching the film at the same time; so, someone who watches the movie in a theatre can recommend it to their friends who can watch it immediately online, instead of waiting for it (and most likely forgetting about it). This enables a small indie film the potential to stand out based on its quality and connection with the audience while giving it wider outreach and longer shelf life.”</p>
      <p>MovieSaints hopes to provide distribution solutions to indie films in India, Asia and then across the world. They have an interesting roster of films – with quite a spread from the North East. Moreover, they not only offer their technology but also work directly with filmmakers to create customized promotion and marketing strategies for their films.</p>
