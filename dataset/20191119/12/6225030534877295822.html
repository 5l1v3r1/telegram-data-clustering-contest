      <p>Oklahoma-bred <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Welder">Welder</a></b> has developed into a local star in his native state. Over five seasons of racing, almost exclusively at Remington Park and Will Rogers Downs, the gelding has racked up 21 wins from 31 starts while banking $970,998.</p>
      <p>On Friday night, Welder continued his winning ways with his ninth straight victory at Remington Park and third straight Silver Goblin Stakes win while posting the fastest Brisnet Speed Rating of the past week with a 102.</p>
      <p>Welder set a contested pace in the 6 1/2-furlong Silver Goblin before opening up in the stretch, rolling to an 11-length victory at odds of .05-to-1. A 6-year-old gelding by The Visualizer, Welder is owned by Clayton Rash's Ra-Max Farms and is trained by Theresa Sue Luneack.</p>
      <p>Rash, who founded an international welding business, said Welder was purchased as a yearling as part of a six-horse package at $6,400 apiece. The seller, however, originally wanted $12,000 for Welder as a throw-in.</p>
      <p>“I think I would have paid the $12,000 for him then, but this was negotiating,” Rash said. “Someone could come up and offer me $1 million for him now and I wouldn’t take it. I really wouldn’t.”</p>
      <p>Next on the agenda for Welder is to earn millionaire status.</p>
      <p>“We’ll have to see if there’s anything that he would be eligible for the rest of the meet,” Luneack said. “We would like it very much if he could break the $1 million-mark at Remington Park.”</p>
      <p>Repole Stable's Dream Bigger stamped himself as a 2-year-old to watch on Sunday when winning the Notebook Stakes for New York-breds and posting a 99 Brisnet Speed Figure. Trained by Rudy Rodriguez, Dream Bigger rated just off the pace before opening a four-length lead in mid-stretch and coasting to victory as the odds-on favorite.</p>
      <p>By Mission Impazible, Dream Bigger is being pointed to the $500,000 New York Stallion Series Great White Way on Dec. 14.</p>
      <p>High Velocity for trainer Bob Baffert was the other 2-year-old of note from this past week. Owned by Gary and Mary West, High Velocity showed some fight when gamely putting away the well-regarded Strongconstitution in deep stretch of the Bob Hope Stakes (G3) at Del Mar.</p>
      <p>High Velocity is now 2-for-2 and could make his next start in the Los Alamitos Futurity (G2) on Dec. 7. <br/>Here is a look at the 15 fastest Brisnet Speed Figures of the past week:</p>
