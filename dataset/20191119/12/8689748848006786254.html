      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:46:41+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/ghbase2/" target="_blank">Ghbase New Writer</a></address>
      <p>During Stonebwoy’s performance at the just ended 2019 4Syte Music Video Awards held at the Kempinski Hotel in Accra, the Bhim Nation president acknowledged the impact of Sarkodie and Shatta Wale in the industry by saying it will take almost 40-years to replace them.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Big up to SM, big up to Shatta Wale mi breda, big up to Sarkodie mi breda. It will take another 40 years to find me, Sarkodie and Shatta in this industry. Forty years. We be national asset. If you like don’t protect, if you like protect, we be national asset.”</p>
      <p>In expanding this subject, music producer and entertainment pundit, David Kwabena Bolton told MzGee on 3FM that what Stonebwoy said was spot on.</p>
      <p>He explained by saying just like Daddy Lumba, Kojo Antwi and Amakye Dede controlled Ghana Music for a very long time, these three artists are replicating it in their current generation.</p>
      <p>He said:</p>
      <p>“All Stonebwoy was trying to say by that statement is that, just as it took many years after Daddy Lumba, Amakye Dede and Kojo Antwi for us to have these whole influence of Sarkodie, Shatta Wale, and Stonebwoy controlling the industry at once, it’s the same way it would take some more years to have these influence of another batch of artistes.”</p>
      <p>He added:</p>
      <p>“Musicians would come and go just like the Daddy Lumba era but the likes of daddy Lumba, Amakye Dede, Kojo Antwi are the relevant musicians from that era. Same thing Stonebwoy is trying to say by that statement that it would take some more years to have many artistes controlling the industry at once and staying relevant for many years.”</p>
