      <p>Kevin Clifton has admitted he’s swapped clubbing for cups of tea ever since shacking up with Stacey Dooley.</p>
      <p>Seems he no longer needs attention from other women and good for him.</p>
      <p>The pair made things official after winning last year’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> title and now the pair are trucking along nicely Kevin loves the quiet nights in.</p>
      <p>‘I used to be like, “When I’m in a bar I need to be the coolest one that can drink more than anyone else and I need the girls to fancy me”,’ he told The Sun.</p>
      <p>‘I thought I needed it all to exist, when actually I didn’t need any of it to exist. I realised, “Do I really want to be in a bar until 4am trying to get someone’s approval?” Or would I rather [be] at home watching Match of the Day with a cup of tea?</p>

      <p>The feeling is mutual, as<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/07/stacey-dooley-says-boyfriend-kevin-clifton-incredible-teacher-shows-support-strictly-exit-10872940/"> Stacey herself cooed over her boyfriend,</a> calling her romance with Kevin ‘amazing’ and insisting she is ‘happy’ and feels ‘very lucky’ to have him.</p>
      <p>She previously said: ‘Kev and I have agreed not to go into too much detail about our private lives because you can’t really indulge that and then ask for privacy.</p>
      <p>‘That’s why we’ve turned down interviews that have offered us tens of thousands of pounds. What I am happy to say is Kev’s amazing, I’m happy, life happens, I’ve got an amazing career and I’m very lucky.’</p>
      <p>The pair celebrated Kevin’s 37th birthday recently, after Stacey praised her beau following his knock out from Strictly.</p>
      <p>Kevin and dance partner Anneka Rice were booted off 2019’s season of Strictly Come Dancing in the second week.</p>
      <p>After the announcement of their elimination, Stacey told fans on social media: ‘Kev and Anneka got knocked out this weekend and I just want to say I am so proud of both of them, but particularly Kevin because I just think he is the most incredible teacher.’</p>
