      <h1>Why Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot Are Tweeting #ReleaseTheSnyderCut</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:00:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Kyle Buchanan</a></address>
      <p>The most talked-about movie on social media this week is one that may never come out.</p>
      <p>Two years after the release of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/movies/justice-league-review-wonder-woman-batman-dc-comics.html?module=inline">“Justice League,”</a> a critically derided superhero team-up starring, among others, Ben Affleck as Batman and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, those stars took to social media to advocate for a different cut of the film, one made by its deposed director, Zack Snyder.</p>
      <p>“#ReleaseTheSnyderCut,” Gadot tweeted on Sunday afternoon, echoed in short order by Affleck. Snyder, who was replaced by director Joss Whedon when Warner Bros. ordered reshoots for “Justice League,” quote-tweeted both stars approvingly.</p>

      <p>It’s the latest step in a superhero saga with no happy ending in sight, and an outcome few could have foreseen several years ago when Warner Bros., eager for a cinematic comic-book universe that could rival Marvel’s, handed some of its most prized DC Comics characters to Snyder.</p>
      <p>The director of comic-book adaptations like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/08/arts/08iht-fmreview9.4839934.html?module=inline">“300”</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/06/movies/06Watc.html?module=inline">“Watchmen,” </a>Snyder kicked things off with the 2013 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/movies/man-of-steel-depicts-a-striving-stranger-in-a-strange-land.html?module=inline">“Man of Steel,”</a> which cast Henry Cavill as Superman. That film grossed $668 million worldwide, but instead of following it with a traditional Superman sequel, Snyder next directed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/movies/review-batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-when-super-friends-fight.html?module=inline">“Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice”</a> (2016), which added Affleck and Gadot to the mix and featured cameos from Ezra Miller (as the Flash) and Ray Fisher (as Cyborg), that were meant to tease their inclusion in “Justice League.”</p>
      <p>Though “Batman v Superman” made $873 million worldwide, reviews were scathing, and Warner Bros. executives worried that Snyder’s increasingly dark take on these classic comic-book characters skewed too adult, alienating audiences that preferred Marvel’s more family-friendly sense of humor. Still, there was little time to course-correct: Snyder was set to begin production on “Justice League,” originally conceived as a two-film project, just weeks after “Batman v Superman” had been released.</p>
      <p>On the London set of “Justice League,” Snyder <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/06/zack-snyder-set-justice-league.html">assured reporters</a> that he had taken the reviews of “Batman v Superman” to heart, but after he completed principal production, Warner Bros. announced in May 2017 that Snyder would be stepping down from the project. Snyder <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/zack-snyder-steps-down-justice-league-deal-family-tragedy-1006455">said at the time</a> that he was leaving “Justice League” to attend to his family after his daughter’s suicide.</p>
      <p>After screening Snyder’s rough cut of “Justice League” for a small group of filmmakers including the “Straight Outta Compton” screenwriter Andrea Berloff, the “Wonder Woman” scribe Allan Heinberg and “The Avengers” director Joss Whedon, Warner Bros. hired Whedon to helm a substantial round of reshoots that included almost 80 new script pages. This version gave Gadot and “Man of Steel” holdovers Amy Adams and Diane Lane far more to do, significantly trimmed subplots involving the Flash and Cyborg (one character, a love interest for Miller played by Kiersey Clemons, was cut entirely) and added more jokes.</p>
      <p>The studio had hoped that Whedon could bring to “Justice League” the same light touch that had lifted <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl709199361/?ref_=bo_shs_sd">“The Avengers” to $1.5 billion</a> at the box office, but Whedon was ultimately thwarted by significant production issues including a lead actor, Cavill, who was busy shooting “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” and whose facial hair from that film had to be erased in postproduction. In the end, it was all for naught: The Whedon cut of “Justice League” was released in November 2017 to poor reviews and a box-office total that came in well below both “Batman v Superman" and “Man of Steel.”</p>
      <p>In the years since, Snyder has <a href="https://heroichollywood.com/justice-league-zack-snyder-henry-cavill-superman-bts/">used the social network Vero</a> to tease images from his vision of the film, and fans have pleaded with Warner Bros. to release Snyder’s cut. But will the studio listen? Allowing Snyder to go back and finish the film would probably require an eight-figure investment, given the extensive special effects that remained incomplete in his version.</p>
      <p>And while Warner Bros. has found significant success making stand-alone films based on Gadot’s Wonder Woman and Jason Momoa’s Aquaman, the studio no longer seems to prioritize getting them back together with their old teammates: Cavill has no Superman appearances left on his docket, and Warner Bros. recently recast Batman with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/movies/robert-pattinson-the-lighthouse.html?module=inline">Robert Pattinson</a> for a brand-new take on the material due in 2021. Affleck and Gadot may have lent their weight to #ReleaseTheSnyderCut, but corporate indifference is a foe against which few superheroes can hope to prevail.</p>
