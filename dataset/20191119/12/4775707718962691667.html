      <h3>The Five Quickest Game Completions from the latest Xbox Sales</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey</a>, 19 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>The Deals with Gold sales stories are pretty slim this week, presumably with Black Friday and Cyber Monday looming on the horizon — Major Nelson must be saving the good stuff for next week. Unfortunately, this means we don't have many quick and easy game completions for you. Only five games with low TA ratios and short completion times have made our list. We've linked directly to the Microsoft Store where you can pick up any of these games and each title's hub where you can find achievement guides and walkthroughs.</p>

      <p>The easiest completion on this list as determined by its TA ratio is <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Three-Fourths-Home-Extended-Edition/achievements">Three Fourths Home: Extended Edition</a>. The game isn't on sale itself but is included in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/digerati-indie-darling-bundle-vol-1/bwgqq30mmdlq?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Digerati Indie Darling Bundle Vol. 1</a>. The Digerati Indie Bundle is on sale for just $9.99 and includes four games, <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Three-Fourths-Home-Extended-Edition/achievements">Three Fourths Home: Extended Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Slain/achievements">Slain: Back from Hell</a>, <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/The-Sun-and-Moon/achievements">The Sun and Moon</a> and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Uncanny-Valley/achievements">Uncanny Valley</a>. Three Fourths Home: Extended Edition, has an easy completion with just ten achievements worth 1000G. There is a bunch of achievement guides if you get stuck and a fantastic <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Three-Fourths-Home-Extended-Edition/walkthrough">walkthrough</a> with over 350 likes from the community. Estimated completion time is about 2-3 hours. <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Uncanny-Valley/achievements">Uncanny Valley</a> also features in the bundle, another an easy completion with 12 achievements for 1000G. All achievements on Uncanny Valley's list are flagged as missable. Unfortunately, we don't have a walkthrough written for this one yet, but we do have plenty of achievement guides that should help. Bear in mind that Slain, also included in the bundle, is considerably harder to complete with a 20 hour estimate and a <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/a224451/heart-of-steel-achievement">gruelling one-life-only achievement</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Albedo-Eyes-from-Outer-Space/achievements">Albedo: Eyes from Outer Space</a> is another easy 1000G. 30 achievements for this one and it's currently on sale for under $3. The TA community hasn't looked too favourably on Albedo, rating it 1.51/5 — so it's probably safe to say the adventure game is only worth it for the achievements. We do have a <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Albedo-Eyes-from-Outer-Space/walkthrough">walkthrough</a> which estimates the game should take you about 2-3 hours to complete.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Guns-Gore-and-Cannoli-2/achievements">Guns, Gore &amp; Cannoli 2</a> is the highest-rated game on our list this week, coming in at a very respectable 3.9/5 from the TA cohort. The run &amp; gun game has 20 achievements worth 1000G and is estimated to take about 4-5 hours to complete. It's on sale for under $10, and with it being so well received, it's probably worth picking up anyway. Some achievements like <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/a261321/homerun-achievement">Homerun</a>, <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/a261322/quick-draw-achievement">Quick Draw</a> and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/a261320/mindblowing-achievement">Mindblowing</a> might prove a little challenging, but we have plenty of achievement guides that should help you breeze through those.</p>
      <p>Finally, we have <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/The-Town-of-Light/achievements">The Town of Light</a> with its 20 achievements worth 1000 Gamerscore. Estimated completion time of 3-4 hours, but potentially quicker if you follow our <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/The-Town-of-Light/walkthrough">Walkthrough</a>. The adventure game is on sale for $5.99 and is liked by TA members, giving the title a 3.13/5.</p>
      <p>That's your lot for this week! Let us know in the comments if you think we've missed any easy completions from this week's sales and if you'll be picking up any of the games from our list.</p>
