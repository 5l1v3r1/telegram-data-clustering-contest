      <p>"After two or three scans it became clear that Tom needs an operation to repair the shoulder injury he picked up with Wales at the World Cup," Baxter said in a statement https://www.exeterchiefs.co.uk/news/prop-pieretto-signs-for-the-chiefs.</p>
      <p>He added that they signed Argentina's Enrique Pieretto until the end of the season as cover.</p>
