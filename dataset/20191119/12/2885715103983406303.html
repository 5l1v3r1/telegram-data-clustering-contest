      <p>Two days after a massive ATM fraud racket in Tripura came to light, four persons, including two Turkish nationals, were detained in West Bengal in the wee hours of Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>The Tripura Police Cyber Crime Department wrote on their social media page Tuesday that with the help of “effective inputs”, four people — two Turkish nationals identified as Hakan Zanburkan and Fettah Aldemir, and two Bangladeshi nationals identified as Md Hannan and Md Rafiqul Islam — were detained at Belgharia in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>As many as 28 cases related to ATM frauds and card cloning were registered in different police stations under Sadar sub-division on Monday. Sadar (Agartala) Sub Divisional Police Officer Dhruba Nath said at least 15 cases were registered on Tuesday, and more complaints were being lodged.</p>
      <p>Superintendent of Police (Crime Branch) Sarmistha Chakraborty was not available for her comments on the arrests. Nath declined to comment on when the four would be brought back to Tripura, saying that was for the cyber crime cell to take a call on.</p>
      <p>According to estimates, around Rs 30 lakh has been stolen in the ATM fraud racket in Agartala alone. The cumulative quantum of loss could cross Rs 1 crore, sources said.</p>
      <p>On Monday, SBI had issued a press release appealing to its customers to remain calm and approach their respective bank branches in case of any financial loss due to card cloning.</p>
      <p>Crime Branch had on Monday said on their official social media page, “…so many cases of ATM card cloning have been reported at various PSs… Customers with ATM cards of different banks are requested to block their accounts and change their pin as early as possible.”</p>
