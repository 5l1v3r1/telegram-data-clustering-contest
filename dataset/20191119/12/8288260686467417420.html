      <p>Indeed, Almiron is yet to score since his January arrival from MLS side Atlanta United.</p>
      <p>However, their profligacy in front of goal hasn't coincided with a drop in form for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a> 's side..</p>

      <p>Magpies supporters on social media remain enthusiastic about playmaker Almiron despite his lack of goals.</p>
      <p>Both he and Saint-Maximin have played in the past two matches - wins over West Ham United and AFC Bournemouth respectively.</p>
      <p>Saint-Maximin assisted in the Bournemouth win last time out and is starting to have an impact after an injury his start to life on Tyneside having arrived from Nice in the summer.</p>
      <p>Next up is a crucial visit to 17th placed <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> on Monday night - just four points separate the two sides in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes, you just need the one goal, and it will come,” Dubravka told the <a href="https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/18044148.allan-saint-maximin-miguel-almiron-backed-score-newcastle/">Northern Echo</a>.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Miguel and Allan are working really hard, and the team effort is always there.</p>
      <p>“It’s not really important who scores, but obviously it will be better for the strikers, for their confidence, to score some goals.</p>
      <p>"At least we’re working really hard and creating chances, and hopefully it will come.”</p>
