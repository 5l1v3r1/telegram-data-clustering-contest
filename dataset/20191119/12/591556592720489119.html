      <p>A little over a week after releasing iOS 13.2.2, Apple has rolled out iOS and iPad OS 13.2.3 to address bugs in Mail, Files, Notes, and Messages, among other issues. </p>
      <p>While iOS 13.2.2 fixed a multitasking bug introduced in iOS 13.2, there were concerns it may have also <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-13-2-2-causes-battery-havoc/">introduced a battery-draining problem</a>. <br/><br/>There were <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250843350">several reports</a> on <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250843990">Apple's community forum</a> from users experiencing rapid battery drain on iPhone and iPad devices <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250840119">after installing iOS 13.2.2</a>.<br/><br/><b>SEE: </b><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/downloads/tr-eb-apple-shortcuts-pdf/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b"><b>Top 20 Apple keyboard shortcuts for business users</b></a><b> (free PDF)</b>    <br/><br/>Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210393#1323">release notes for iOS 13.2.3</a> don't mention any issues that could be specifically connected to battery-drain issues.</p>
      <p>However, there is a fix for a bug that caused system search and search within Mail, Files, and Notes to stop working. <br/><br/>It also fixes a Messages bug that stopped photos, links, and attachments from displaying in the app. There was also an issue that could prevent apps from downloading content in the background. </p>
      <p>The final fix listed address a bug that prevented Mail from fetching new messages and stopped it including and quoting original message content in Exchange accounts. <br/><br/>Overall, the update appears to be a relatively minor one. Apple didn't disclose any security vulnerabilities with the release of iOS 13.2.2 or iOS 13.2.2.   <br/><br/><b>SEE: </b><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-16-inch-macbook-pro-teardown-reveals-old-scissor-switch-keyboard-in-all-its-glory/"><b>New 16-inch MacBook Pro: Teardown reveals old scissor-switch keyboard in all its glory</b></a><br/><br/>The iOS 13.2 multitasking bug <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-13-has-a-huge-bug-that-makes-me-want-to-dump-my-iphone-and-ipad/">was a frustrating productivity-killer for users</a>. After opening a new app and leaving an already opened app to run in the background, users would find that the already opened app would reload and content would be lost. <br/><br/>Apple explained in the iOS 13.2.2 release notes that this problem occurred because apps would quit unexpectedly when running in the background.</p>
