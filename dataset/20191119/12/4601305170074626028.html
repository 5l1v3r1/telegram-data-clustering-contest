      <h1>Sudden Trump trip to hospital 'just a physical', officials say</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:52:49+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/rob_beschizza" target="_blank">Rob Beschizza</a></address>
      <p>The president made an unscheduled weekend visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to "get a head start on his annual physical", but everyone is so accustomed to him and his staff lying about things it's blown up into a credible health scare. <a href="https://nbcmontana.com/news/nation-world/trumps-weekend-hospital-visit-draws-a-skeptical-reaction">NBC News reports on the "skeptical reaction."</a></p>
      <blockquote>For any president, a sudden trip to the hospital would raise questions. But such scrutiny was magnified with a president who has a history of exaggeration and playing loose with the facts, giving skeptics room to run with their own theories.<br/><br/>“The one thing you can be absolutely sure of is this was not routine and he didn't go up there for half his physical,” tweeted Joe Lockhart, a press secretary under President Bill Clinton, who was himself impeached for perjury and obstruction. “What does it mean? It means that we just won't know what the medical issue was.”</blockquote>
      <p>Note how the speculation abut his health echoes his own crude rumor-monging about the health of others. Bullshit is a hallmark of autocracy, but getting everyone to play by the same rules is another.</p>
