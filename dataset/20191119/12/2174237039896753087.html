      <p>Actor Jason Momoa recruited a death metal vocalist to help him perfect his guttural growl in new Apple TV+ science fiction series <i>See</i>.</p>
      <p>Momoa plays Baba Voss – the father of twins born centuries after a virus decimated the human race, leaving the survivors blind. With the twins born with the ability to see, Voss must protect his tribe from a queen who will stop at nothing to capture the children.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/see-heavy-metal-vocalist-interview-1202190546/">Indiewire</a> report that the <i>Game Of Thrones</i> and <i>Aquaman</i> star is a fan of death metal band <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/archspire-relentless-mutation-album-review">Archspire</a>, with Momoa asking frontman Oil Peters to train him for a scene where Voss rallies his troops in a Haka-style ceremony prior to battle.</p>
      <p>Peters tells the website: “Jason has such an interest in music and has done aggressive acting scenes before, so he was a quick learner for this.</p>
      <p>“We spent time getting him familiar with what the vocal style is and were messaging back and forth while Archspire was on tour. </p>
      <p>“When we hung out on sets, in between takes I’d come over to him and we’d go over the lines together.”</p>
      <p>Peters and Archspire drummer Spencer Prewett even got the chance to make a cameo in the scene, with Peters saying: “Being on a big-budget TV set was a trip, and Jason putting us in speaks to the creative side of what he does. He has this crazy reputation and status, but he’s just a fun metal dude.”</p>
      <p>In December last year, Momoa <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/jason-momoa-says-aquaman-was-inspired-by-tool">told <i>Metal Hammer</i> that his portrayal of Aquaman was inspired by Tool and their song <i>Ticks And Leeches</i></a>.</p>
      <p>He said: "Aquaman's pretty metal. I know no one thinks that, but Aquaman's metal. I kind of build my characters off of metal songs. Conan The Barbarian was really heavy <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/ten-of-the-best-pantera-songs-of-all-time">Pantera</a>, I'd say Aquaman was probably mostly built out of <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/every-tool-album-and-one-ep-ranked-from-worst-to-best">Tool</a> and <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-50-best-metallica-songs-of-all-time">Metallica</a> album <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/kill-em-all-metallica-changed-the-world"><i>Kill 'Em All</i></a>. <i>Ticks And Leeches</i>, if I want to get specific. There's a lot of Sabbath in there too.”</p>
