      <p>A family said they were left feeling ‘sick and violated’ after they were given a meat pizza instead of a vegetarian supreme from Domino’s.</p>
      <p>Father Sami Khan noticed a funny taste in his mouth after eating a slice, but then realised it was pork, which cannot be consumed by Muslims.</p>
      <p>Domino’s said it was an innocent mistake, but the family-of-five from Exeter, Devon, said it is not good enough.</p>
      <p>Sami’s wife Ambia said: ‘My husband ate one slice and he wasn’t sure, so he looked on another slice of pizza and saw the pork.</p>
      <p>‘He feels sick and violated as it’s pork sausage and we’re Muslim. Pork is an absolute no, and on top of that we are vegetarian.</p>

      <p>‘Domino’s have dealt with this situation horrendously. They said we could have a replacement pizza, but we didn’t want anything from them.</p>
      <p>‘When my husband took the pizza to them in Honiton Road they confirmed it was sausage. No one came to our house to collect the pizza for investigation.. In the shop they apologised but said, ‘it’s busy shop, it happens, just deal with it’.</p>

      <p>‘They offered replacement but after experiencing this we don’t want anything from them. What about if we were allergic? They can’t say sorry if that person happened to die.</p>
      <p>‘This is morally and ethically wrong.</p>
      <p>‘If it can happen to us it can happen again. They need to do something to ensure there is no risk of cross contamination. It is serious and for an established business like Domino’s it should be priority.’</p>

      <p>A Domino’s spokesman said: ‘This was an innocent mistake.</p>
      <p>‘When the customer notified us we immediately apologised and collected the pizza to investigate further.</p>
      <p>‘We issued a full refund to the customer and offered to remake and deliver a fresh order.’</p>
      <p>In 2017, a Muslim man sued America’s third largest pizza chain – Little Caesars – for $100 million (£78 million) after being served a pizza labelled halal which was topped with pork pepperoni.</p>
