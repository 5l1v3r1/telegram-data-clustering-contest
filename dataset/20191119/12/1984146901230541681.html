      <h1>Winter vomiting bug forces further two schools in Jarrow to close as 'significant number' fall ill</h1>
      <h2>Jarrow School and Jarrow Cross C of E Primary School were both closed on Tuesday</h2>

      <p>Two South Tyneside schools have been closed after pupils were struck down with the winter vomiting bug.</p>
      <p>Jarrow School and Jarrow Cross C of E Primary School were shut on Tuesday to allow a deep clean to take place.</p>
      <p>A "significant number" of students were reporting symptoms of fever, sore throat and vomiting at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/education">Jarrow School,</a> according to a letter sent to parents.</p>
      <p>The letter, posted on the school's <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page, stated the school would be closed until Wednesday.</p>

      <p>It added: "This will allow us to complete a further deep clean of the school and enable us to reopen the school on Wednesday 20 November.</p>
      <p>"If your son or daughter begins to display any symptoms similar to those mentioned above, it is essential that they do not return to school until they have fully recovered."</p>
      <p>Susan McBeth, head teacher of Jarrow Cross C of E Primary School, said the wellbeing of pupils was their primary concern.</p>
      <p>She said: "In light of the number of pupils and staff affected by this virus, we took the decision to close the school until Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"The school has had a deep clean and we will re-open tomorrow."</p>
      <p>It comes after <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/st-mary-school-jarrow-closed-17262354">hundreds of pupils were told to stay at home</a> after the winter bug hit St Mary's RC Voluntary Aided Primary School in Jarrow last week.</p>
      <p>The school was closed at the end of last week and a deep clean was carried out, with pupils and staff returning on Monday.</p>
      <p>Public Health England North East health protection team was also called to Kells Lane Primary School in Low Fell, Gateshead, following <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/health-officials-called-fever-vomiting-17251800">reports of a large number of sick children.</a></p>
      <p>More than 60 pupils were said to have fallen ill.</p>
