      <h1>England Euro 2020 squad: Who's on the coach now qualification has been secured?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:17:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/alistair-tweedale/" target="_blank">Alistair Tweedale</a></address>
      <p>With the Euro 2020 qualifying process complete and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/17/gareth-southgate-england-better-shape-world-cup-securing-top/">progress to next summer's finals wrapped up</a>, it is time for Gareth Southgate to start thinking about his squad for the tournament.</p>
      <p>There is plenty of time for injuries and form to alter things, but it isn't too early for us to start speculating about which players will make the cut.</p>
      <p>Here, we predict Southgate's Euro 2020 squad seven months out from the tournament, with every player that we think will be on the England manager's radar considered. Who will be on the coach to Wembley for England's opening match on June 14?</p>
      <h3>Doubtful to make the squad</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Goalkeepers</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jack Butland was once England's next great hope in goal, but his England chances have fallen almost as far as his team's league position. Stoke are now 23rd in the Championship and Butland is extremely unlikely to make the England squad for next summer, unless he can force a January move to the top flight.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Defenders</b>
      </p>
      <p>England have so many options at right-back that it would take something special for Reece James to play his way into contention but the way things are going at Chelsea, it wouldn't be a surprise to see him become Frank Lampard's first-choice before long, and Southgate would be open-minded about considering him for England.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Luke Shaw, James Tarkowski and Callum Chambers have all had chances in previous England squads and can't be completely written off, but each would probably need an injury crisis to find their way into the squad for next year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Midfielders</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aston Villa fans cannot understand Jack Grealish's continued absence from the England fold, and he might reconsider his decision to opt for England over the Republic of Ireland, particularly if Ireland win their Euro 2020 play-off and offer him a place in their squad next summer. Grealish now has only a handful of international friendlies in which not only to get into the squad but then also convince Southgate he should go to the Euros. It's probably too late, in all honesty.</p>
      <p>Phil Foden is without doubt a future England player, but he can't get a game at Manchester City yet, and that would have to change for him to make it into Southgate's plans.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year both Nathan Redmond and James Ward-Prowse were included in England squads but Southampton's poor start to the season has seen them drop out of contention. They are now way down the pecking order.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Ruben Loftus-Cheek is working his way back from an Achilles injury so faces a race against time to get back in the Chelsea team and then convince Southgate he is worthy of a spot in the England fold. He does, however, offer something different to every other player in contention for a midfield spot, and he has previously impressed on England duty. He is a greater physical presence than any other English midfielder and possesses brilliant dribbling skills, too. If he can get back to fitness, he will be considered.</p>
      <p>Southgate has shown a willingness to pick untested players based on form, but it is probably too late now even for Leicester's Harvey Barnes and Burnley's flying winger Dwight McNeil, even though both would be unique additions to the squad. Two for the future, perhaps.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Forwards</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jamie Vardy is the most in-form English striker around at the moment, and there will be plenty of people who would support an attempt to get him out of retirement in time for the Euros. But that isn't really Southgate's style.</p>
      <h3>Outside chance</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Goalkeepers</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dean Henderson has played his way into contention with a string of fine performances for Sheffield United. He has the third-best save percentage in the Premier League this season, behind Kasper Schmeichel and Hugo Lloris, having kept out 78.6 per cent of the shots on target he has faced, and that has caught Southgate's eye.</p>
      <p>He is currently fourth in line, but has time to oust one of the three ahead of him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Defenders</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kyle Walker has fallen out of favour with England after starting the season poorly with Manchester City. He played as part of a back three at the 2018 World Cup, with Kieran Trippier preferred at right wing-back. This time around, Walker also has Trent Alexander-Arnold to contend with, and that could mean Walker doesn't even make the squad.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Aaron Wan-Bissaka makes up a hotly-contested field at right-back, but he has too many players to overtake to make it into the England squad by next summer.</p>
      <p>Michael Keane and Fikayo Tomori are the two centre-backs currently floating just outside the squad, ready and waiting to pounce if anyone starts to struggle with form or picks up and injury.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Midfielders</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both Eric Dier and Jesse Lingard have arguably been fortunate to cling on to their England positions as long as they did, both having been called up this year.</p>
      <p>They are now both down the pecking order, but they do have experience on their side should Southgate believe a little more know-how is required in the squad.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Forwards</b>
      </p>
      <p>Callums Hudson-Odoi and Wilson were both in the latest England squad and could well make the cut next summer, but they might be relying on Southgate removing a defender or midfielder from the squad in order to take another attacker, rather than either of these players replacing one of their direct competitors.</p>
      <figure>

      <h3>Likely</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Goalkeepers</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/10/injured-tom-heaton-pulls-england-squad-sheffield-uniteds-dean/">Tom Heaton pulled out of the latest England squad with injury</a>, opening up a possible avenue for Henderson, but he is an experienced, trusted and useful member of the England set-up, and will be hopeful of retaining his place next summer. Nick Pope is also almost certain to be in the squad, having made his England debut in Kosovo last week. Henderson's club form leaves an ounce of doubt in the goalkeeping positions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Defenders</b>
      </p>
      <p>The wealth of right-backs available to Gareth Southgate means it is difficult to predict who will make it. Kieran Trippier is a favourite of the England manager's, and his promising start to life at Atletico Madrid seems only to have strengthened his chances of retaining a spot in the squad.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/11/19/TELEMMGLPICT000215762639_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqF4WwDpbO-CkdHTTCi9TWzvA6hDsX4eDN9gfMVGHPdkQ.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Danny Rose is woefully out of form and might well lose his place in the Tottenham team on a regular basis, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/13/danny-rose-plans-run-tottenham-contract-will-not-leave-early/">particularly after his most recent outburst</a>. He has fallen behind Ben Chilwell in the England team and is only clinging onto his place in the squad here because there aren't many alternatives.</p>
      <p>Joe Gomez and Tyrone Mings are both rated highly by Southgate and have a chance of starting at the Euros. They also, however, could yet be overtaken by one of the outsiders, such as Tomori, by the time next summer comes around. Gomez may need to be playing more frequently for Liverpool than he currently is.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Midfielders</b>
      </p>
      <p>Southgate has a huge number of options in central midfield and will probably take a fair few of them to the finals next summer, but his chopping and changing from game to game has left us guessing as to his favoured trio. The quantity of midfielders available makes it difficult to predict Southgate's selections.</p>
      <p>There are certain senior players that the England manager clearly values highly, including Fabian Delph. He withdrew from the latest England squad with a hamstring injury, but no replacement was called up, perhaps hinting at the fact that there is no other player - in Southgate's opinion - who can provide the leadership qualities Delph has. </p>
      <p>Southgate seems intent on persisting with Declan Rice at the base of midfield, while Harry Winks provides something different but is also very much in favour. Winks' place in the Tottenham team has been under threat recently, though, so he could lose out with England if he drops down the pecking order at club level.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Chelsea duo Ross Barkley and Mason Mount both offer something different slightly further forward, and Southgate obviously likes what they bring to the team. As long as their form continues and they avoid injuries, both should be in next summer's squad.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/18/alex-oxlade-chamberlain-deserves-dose-good-fortune-chance-euro/">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has had rotten luck </a>in recent years, having missed the last three major tournaments through injury, but he has more than just romance on his side this time around, with the Liverpool midfielder now back to form and fitness. He might struggle to get into the Liverpool team, but that will not mean he doesn't deserve an England spot.</p>
      <p>England's problem in years gone by has often been a lack of creativity, and in James Maddison they have a ready-made and versatile No 10 to go to the Euros. Southgate hasn't yet seemed over keen on Maddison, though, and it will be a tight call whether he makes the cut.</p>
      <p>One of the biggest decisions for Southgate regards Dele Alli, who was a key player at the World Cup in Russia but he had a poor season last year and has struggled with a few injuries, too. The number of players coming through mean Alli is up against it, but he will be given as long as possible to rediscover form and prove he should be in the squad. As things stand, however, he probably just misses out.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Forwards</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jadon Sancho and Tammy Abraham are two of the most exciting attackers in European football at the moment, and both have a good chance of going to next summer's tournament.</p>
      <p>Sancho has been a fixture in recent England squads since breaking through at Borussia Dortmund, while Abraham got his first England goal in the win over Montengro last week. He has probably now overtaken Wilson in the pecking order, but will need to keep up his impressive start to the season in order to retain that position, with competition fierce in the attacking positions.</p>
      <h4>Certainties</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Goalkeepers</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jordan Pickford will be England's starting keeper next summer, fitness permitting. He has the best distribution of the options available to Southgate and that tips the balance in his favour.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Defenders</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is looking as though Southgate has settled on his first-choice back four, with Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ben Chilwell, Harry Maguire and John Stones - as it stands - most likely to make up the starting defence at Wembley next June.</p>
      <p>The full-backs have been in fine form this season and will take some dislodging, and while the centre-backs' starting berths are less certain, they should both be going to the Euros.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Midfielders</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bizarrely, given the sheer volume of central midfielders that have made England squads since the last World Cup, there is only one that can be sure of his place in the squad for next summer, and that is the much-criticised - but reinvented - Jordan Henderson.</p>
      <p>The players around him have changed time and again but Henderson is a rare constant in this England midfield.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Forwards</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/18/england-frontline-good-team-euro-2020-insists-gareth-southgate/">Southgate says there won't be many better front threes at next year's competition than England's</a>, and Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford will be the first-choice trio in attack at Euro 2020, barring some huge surprise over the next seven months.</p>
      <p>So, here's our squad for next summer, as things stand...</p>
