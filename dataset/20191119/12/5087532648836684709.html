      <h3>Focus on Apps</h3>
      <p>It seems the event will highlight some of the apps that were most popular throughout 2019. Apple does usually share the details of the best performers in the run-up to the holidays. The event seems to be a continuation of that. Journalist Lance Ulanoff tweeted out his invite:</p>

      <p>Looking at the invite, it seems unlikely we will get any hardware announcements â€“ although there could always be a surprise!</p>
