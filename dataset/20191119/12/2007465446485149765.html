      <h1>Toyota gives the 2020 Camry all-wheel drive... again</h1>
      <h2>Don’t you wish we had more variants of the Camry here?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:44:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/jose-altoveros.html" target="_blank">Jose Altoveros</a></address>
      <p>When Toyota Motor Philippines (TMP) launched the Camry last year, only two variants were available: 2.5 G and 2.5 V. In the US, however, customers have more variants to choose from including a sportier face, and a fuel-efficient hybrid version. Now, Toyota has expanded the Camry line even more by offering an all-wheel-drive version.</p>
      <p>You read that right. Toyota will be offering the 2020 model year Camry with all-wheel drive. Specifically, the Dynamic Torque Control AWD system which is developed in-house. It's the same system as the one found on the RAV4, and depending on the terrain and situation, the AWD system can send up to 50% of the engine’s torque to the rear axle when needed. When AWD is not needed, the system decouples the rear axle in order to save fuel. However, AWD is automatically engaged once more when the system detects slip.</p>

      <p>Only one engine option will be available with the AWD Camry – a 2.5-liter inline-four gasoline engine paired to an 8-speed automatic transmission. For those wondering, this isn’t the same 2.5-liter mill offered in the Camry locally. Instead, this the more powerful 203 horsepower unit used in the RAV4.</p>
      <p>Toyota says that despite the addition of an AWD system, the interior and cargo space of the Camry has not been compromised. However, these cars will weigh a bit more than the front-wheel-drive only Camrys, specifically 75kg more.</p>

      <p>For those wondering, this won’t be the first time the Camry will gain all-wheel drive. The first all-wheel-drive Camry was offered back in 1988 to 1991 and was called the Camry All-Trac. However, the 2020 model won’t carry the All-Trac name and will simply be called Camry AWD.</p>
      <p>The optional all-wheel-drive system is available on the Camry LE, XLE, SE, and XSE trims in the US. In the future, the larger Avalon sedan will also be offered with all-wheel-drive as well.</p>
      <p>Want a Camry AWD locally? Well, chances are we won’t be getting it.</p>
