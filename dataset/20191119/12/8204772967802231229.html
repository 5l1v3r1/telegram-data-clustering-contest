      <p>As the evenings are getting colder and darker, I want my dinners to be comforting and require minimal effort. “A hug in a bowl”, so to say.</p>

      <p>I invested in a slow cooker about a year ago, and it was one of my best winter purchases. It means I can put my dinner on in the morning and by the day’s end I’ve something warm to tuck into.</p>
      <p>This recipe would also work cooked on the stove top in a shorter time, but I find the slow cooker gives a richer flavour.</p>
      <p>I’ve always loved adding baby potatoes to a curry – don’t knock it till you’ve tried it! It also takes away the hassle of remembering to get the rice on, but if you’re very hungry or feeding a gang, you might still want to add rice.</p>
      <p>This is a simple recipe, but the garnishes are key – adding some chopped coriander, natural yogurt and toasted almond flakes makes the world of a difference. You can make it as spicy or as mild as you like, depending on your taste, and those you’re cooking for. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</p>

        <i>Serves 4</i>
      </p>
      <p>4 chicken breasts<br/>1 tsp of turmeric<br/>3 tsp of curry powder<br/>1 tsp of coriander powder<br/>1 knob of butter<br/>1 can of coconut milk<br/>1 tbsp of tomato purée<br/>1 white onion<br/>1 clove of garlic<br/>A handful of baby potatoes<br/>A handful of green beans<br/>Chilli flakes, salt and pepper to season</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to make it:</b>
      </p>
      <p>1. Chop the veg and meat into large chunks</p>
      <p>2. In a small bowl combine the curry powder, turmeric, coriander and salt.</p>
      <p>3. Add coconut milk to the slow cooker, followed by the chicken breasts,  the bowl of seasoning ingredients, the tomato purée and the baby potatoes, onions and butter. Stir to combine.</p>
      <p>4. Cover the slow cooker and set to Low/Warm for six to eight hours, or High for 4-6 hours.</p>
      <p>5. Before the last hour of cooking, give the curry a stir, and add some extra seasoning/spice if necessary, then add green beans or your veg of choice. Allow to cook for an additional hour.</p>
      <p>6. Turn off slow cooker and let the curry rest for at least 20 minutes before serving it with basmati rice and some chopped coriander. I also add some natural yogurt.</p>
      <p>*Note: This is a very mild curry, so add as much chilli flakes as you like to heat it up.</p>
