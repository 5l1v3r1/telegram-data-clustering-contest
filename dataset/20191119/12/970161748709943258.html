      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/liam-payne/">Liam Payne</a>’s relationship with Maya Henry is going places… including to the City of Love.</p>
      <p>The couple took their relationship public in August, although they are believed to have been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> for months before that, and have been inseparable ever since.</p>
      <p>And Maya, 19, was on hand to accompany her beau to Paris, as the pair were seen disembarking the Eurostar looking effortlessly cool.</p>
      <p>Liam, 26, wore a yellow-trimmed tracksuit beneath a plaid coat, teamed with retro aviator glasses, for the journey, and was serving us Blue Steel vibes as he arrived at Gare du Nord.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, model Maya kept her head down beneath a baseball cap, while wearing a white top, an embroidered denim jacket and tracksuit bottoms.</p>
      <p>The couple’s trip to France comes amid confusion about Maya’s real age – after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/liam-payne-shuts-rumours-girlfriend-maya-henry-lied-age-joking-cheryl-reunion-11064606/">internet sleuths reckoned the model is a year younger than reported.</a></p>

      <p>One such detective tweeted last week: ‘Every article about Liam’s girlfriend says she’s 19 when she’s actually 18.</p>
      <p>‘This is intentional because when fabricating this ridiculous PR campaign for her they said that they’ve been together for a year, which would mean that Liam was dating a 17 y/o. She’s a senior in HS.’</p>

      <p>However, Strip That Down singer Liam – who has a two-year-old son Bear with ex Cheryl – hit back at the claims, tweeting: ’19, don’t believe everything you read on the internet.’</p>
      <p>The confusion stems from a number of alleged birth dates floating about for Maya.</p>
      <p>Various sources claim that Maya was born on 12 February 2001 and 15 June 2000 – although, according to Heat World, Maya herself said she was born in December.</p>
      <p>In a clip from her family’s reality show Hanging With Los Henrys, from 2018, Maya said she was 17 and that she’d be 18 in December – meaning that Maya would now be 18, and turning 19 in a few weeks time.</p>
      <p>In addition to this, in 2016, Maya’s father, Texan attorney Thomas J Henry, threw his daughter an epic quinceañera – a traditional Latin American celebration of a girl’s 15th birthday – worth a whopping $6 million (£4.6 million).</p>

      <p>If the party, which saw Nick Jonas and Pitbull perform, was timely for Maya’s birthday, she would have been 15 in March 2016 – meaning she’d still be 18 now.</p>
