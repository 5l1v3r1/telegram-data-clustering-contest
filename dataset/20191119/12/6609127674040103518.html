        <b>A TOP judge has given permission for a legal challenge against Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal to be resurrected in Scotland’s highest civil court.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lord Boyd of Duncansby gave the go-ahead to a case which has been brought by leading remain campaigner Jo Maugham QC to be heard in the Court of Session in Edinburgh.</p>

      <p>The English barrister wants a Scottish judge to pass an order which would suspend the withdrawal protocol which was negotiated earlier this year by the Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>Mr Maugham believes that aspects of the withdrawal agreement are unlawful.</p>
      <p>He believes that plans to have Northern Ireland follow EU customs laws whilst remaining in the UK’s customs territory isn’t lawful.</p>

      <p>The lawyer believes this is the case because of a piece of legislation which was passed in 2018 called the Taxation (Cross Border Act).</p>
      <p>Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg and his supporters in the European Research Group passed an amendment to the legislation when it was going through Parliament.</p>

        <figcaption>The judge made a ruling</figcaption>

      <p>The amendment - which forms section 55 of the legislation - dictates that Northern Ireland cannot be part of any political arrangement in which it follows rules and regulations which differ from the ones used in other parts of the UK.</p>
      <p>During a hearing at the Court of Session last month, Lord Pentland rejected the claims advanced by Mr Maugham’s legal team.</p>
      <p>He said: “There is nothing to show that this will not play out as intended and work in a satisfactory manner.”</p>
      <p>However, Mr Maugham’s legal team have brought the case back to court.</p>
      <p>Mr Maugham is a director of the Good Law Project.</p>
      <p>The organisation has commissioned reports from trade experts which Mr Maugham says supports the views which were advanced at the October hearing.</p>
      <p>Now Lord Boyd has given permission for Mr Maugham’s lawyers to adjust their arguments in the case.</p>
      <p>They have until December 20 for them to prepare their new case.</p>
      <p>Lord Boyd added: “I will allow for a one day hearing to take place in the case no later than January 10 next year.”</p>
