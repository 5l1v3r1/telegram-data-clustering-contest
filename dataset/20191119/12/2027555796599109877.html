      <h1>Apple special event to honour top apps, games on Dec 2</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:21:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/rohit-kvn" target="_blank">Rohit KVN</a></address>
      <p>For the past few years, Apple has been hosting hardware events in October to unveil the iPad Pro series along with MacBook laptops. In 2019, the company did not announce any such programmes, instead just released a press note announcing the arrival of the AirPods Pro and the MacBook Pro. Most fans and media thought that Apple is done for the year.</p>
      <p>To everyone's surprise, the Cupertino-based technology major has planned a special event in New York City in December first week. There is no official word on whether there will be a new hardware announcement, but it is confirmed to honor popular apps and games on December 2.</p>
      <p>This is a welcome move, as this will offer app developers, an extra incentive to be more creative and improve user-experience in existing apps and games. Also, motivate them to innovate new ones based on user demand. </p>
      <p>More importantly, the new and upcoming developers will find it lucrative to focus on <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/specials/apple-brings-new-power-packed-16-inch-macbook-pro-776194.html">Apple</a> (iOS/iPadOS/watchOS/macOS) ecosystem rather than on Google (Android/Wear OS/Chrome) platforms. We already see that most app creators bring new features and user-friendly on iOS compared to Android.</p>
      <p>It can be noted that Apple's hardware particularly, iPhones, though there is an increase in unit sales, the growth rate is sliding, while the services revenue is growing at a faster pace.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, Apple launched dedicated games and multi-media streaming services-- Arcade and Apple TV+, respectively with monthly (individual or family) subscription options.</p>
      <p>Besides giving the awards, the company has launched a dedicated mobile app for the registered developers. It offers four sections-- Discover, Videos, WWDC (World Wide Developers Conference) and Account, to help them get the latest news on Apple's initiatives and other stuff.</p>
