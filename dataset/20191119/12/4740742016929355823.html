      <h1>Martin Lewis debunks private parking ticket myths and explains how you can appeal</h1>
      <h2>He also reveals how you can fight the fines</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p>Money saving guru Martin Lewis has given the facts about private parking tickets and how to appeal.</p>
      <p>His comments come after a viewer on  ITV's This Morning asked him about whether you can ignore the fines - an issue Martin's been waiting years to address, reports <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/martin-lewis-debunks-private-parking-20908858">the Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>Viewer Vicky asked: “I've had a parking ticket sent to me in the post from a private company, my dad said that he'd heard that as it's private I don't have to pay it. Please can you give me some advice?”</p>
      <p>“That's incorrect information,” Martin replied.</p>
      <p>“We did it on this show a few years ago, someone mis-heard, did a Facebook post about it that was then shared 300,000 times – and I've been trying to correct this one ever since.”</p>

      <h4>So what are the facts?</h4>
      <p>“Private parking tickets are invoices," Martin explained.</p>
      <p>"So if they're unfair invoices you don't have to pay them.</p>
      <p>"But I would always inform them that you believe they're unfair, if they have an appeals system go back through the appeals system.</p>
      <p>"If they don't, write back and say it's unfair, and why you think it is."</p>
      <p>And on one point, the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/money">Money</a>SavingExpert.com founder was absolutely clear.</p>
      <p>“I would not ignore them, and I have never taken that stance," he said.</p>
      <h3>How to appeal a private parking ticket</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>If you feel you have been unfairly charged, the most important rule is don't ignore the letter.</p>
      <p>But Martin also warns don't pay a penny at first. Paying immediately is seen as an admission of guilt and you cannot then subsequently appeal.</p>
      <p>All private parking firms need to be members of an Accredited Trade Association and abide by its code of practice.</p>
      <p>There are currently two of these: the British Parking Association and the International Parking Community.</p>
      <p>Both have independent appeals services that drivers can use if their own appeal fails.</p>
      <p>Check the regulators  websites to see if the parking company is registered.</p>
      <p>You can also call the BPA on 01444 447 300 to check if a company is a member.</p>
      <p>If you think the Parking Charge Notice you've received is unfair or it's above £100, you can contact the company or the landowner explaining your reasons and why you're disputing it.</p>
      <p>Try to gather as much evidence as possible and include it with your letter (such as photographs of the bay, unclear street signs, repair notes if relevant and the ticket itself) - make sure you send this by recorded post or ask the Post Office for proof of postage (this is a free service).</p>
      <p>This is known as an informal appeal - if you're unhappy with the final outcome, you can escalate it externally.</p>
      <p>If you feel the charge is too high, ask for a breakdown of how the losses are calculated. If the maths doesn't add up, contest it.</p>
      <p>For anyone unsure of how to put it in writing, you can use this  <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/parking-tickets/appealing-parking-tickets/appealing-a-parking-ticket/challenge-private-parking-ticket/">Citizens Advice template letter</a>.</p>
      <p>With a hospital parking ticket, you should send evidence to the parking company if your appointment was running late.</p>
      <p>Ask the hospital receptionist to confirm in writing that were delays and send this on to the firm.</p>
      <h3>If your appeal is rejected</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>If you've challenged your ticket and been outright rejected, you can take it to an independent appeals system.</p>
      <p>It's a free to use service, but can only be done after you've exhausted the company's internal appeals process.</p>
      <p>This only applies to firms in the British Parking Association (BPA) Approved Operator Scheme or the Independent Parking Committee (IPC) Independent Appeals Service. If your firm is not registered, it may be breaking the law.</p>
      <p>You have 28 days after stage 2 to make an appeal to the  <a href="http://popla.co.uk/">Parking on Private Land Appeals (POPLA)</a>  and 21 days to take it to the  <a href="https://www.theias.org/">Independent Appeals Service</a>  .</p>
      <p>If the independent adjudicator agrees with you, the charge will be cancelled.</p>
      <p>If POPLA rules in favour of the operator, you may then take your appeal to the  <a href="https://ombudsman-services.org/">Ombudsman Services</a>  .</p>
      <p>If you fail to pay, the company will have the right to take you to a small claims court.</p>
