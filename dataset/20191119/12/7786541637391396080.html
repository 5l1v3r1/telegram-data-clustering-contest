      <p>Fans of the panda have been lining up at the <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/giant-panda">Smithsonian's National Zoo</a> to say goodbye to the panda that many have watched grow from a cub to a 4-year-old bear ready to be relocated to his new home, <a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/bei-beis-fans-visit-him-to-say-goodbye">WJLA reported</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/giant-panda">While the National Zoo</a> breeds the bears, it has an agreement with the China Wildlife Conversation Association to send the pandas born and raised in the U.S. to China to be part of the panda breeding program, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2019/11/19/bei-bei-panda-is-heading-china-he-has-better-travel-setup-than-you-ever-will/">The Washington Post reported</a>.</p>
      <p>His older siblings Bao Bao and Tai Shang made their journeys in 2017 and 2010, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2019/11/19/bei-bei-panda-is-heading-china-he-has-better-travel-setup-than-you-ever-will/">the Post reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Bei Bei leaves behind his parents, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, and will be accompanied on the FedEX flight, dubbed "Panda Express" by a panda keeper and a veterinarian, <a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/bei-beis-fans-visit-him-to-say-goodbye">WJLA reported</a>.</p>

      <p>He won't be able to roam the plane, but will be in a steel and Plexiglass enclosure with all of his toys and food he needs for the 16-hour flight, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2019/11/19/bei-bei-panda-is-heading-china-he-has-better-travel-setup-than-you-ever-will/">The Washington Post reported</a>.</p>

      <p>"The panda team will continuously monitor Bei Bei during the trip," the zoo said in an announcement, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2019/11/19/bei-bei-panda-is-heading-china-he-has-better-travel-setup-than-you-ever-will/">according to The Washington Post</a>.</p>
