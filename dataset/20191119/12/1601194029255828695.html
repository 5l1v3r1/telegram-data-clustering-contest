      <p>This week's <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/raw">RAW</a> was probably a tipping point for all three major WWE brands (RAW, SmackDown, NXT) a few days before Survivor Series 2019.</p>
      <p>The show ended amidst a huge brawl where you couldn't even tell people apart. But an important takeaway emerged from that chaos, where Triple H opened doors for RAW and SmackDown superstars to come to NXT this week.</p>
      <p>It seems that the brand supremacy plot stole the spotlight this week, as other storylines involving the WWE Championship as well as Lana and Bobby Lashley's melodramatic shenanigans took a backseat during the episode.</p>
      <p>How bigger can this brand war get in the next few days?</p>
      <p>Let us take a look at some interesting observations from this week's episode of Monday Night RAW (November 18, 2019):</p>

      <h4>#3: Why NXT has been booked as the strongest brand on RAW so far</h4>

      <p>Since the beginning of the buildup to this year's Survivor Series Pay-Per-View, NXT has been on top of WWE's brand wars so far.</p>
      <p>A huge reason behind it is that <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/triple-h">Triple H</a> has been secretly pulling the strings on and off the screen to make sure that more people tune in to watch NXT on Wednesdays.</p>
      <p>To some extent, they have succeeded, and the numbers might keep increasing for the yellow brand, especially this week, where Triple H openly invited RAW and SmackDown superstars to step foot inside NXT's ring.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, this might also indicate that NXT might not pull off a major victory this Sunday, because WWE tends to showcase wrestlers in a strong light a few days before the Pay-Per-View only for them to lose at the event itself.</p>
      <p>Also, we have to take into account the fact that a lot of NXT's talent is going to be fatigued after performing at NXT TakeOver: WarGames a day before, this Saturday.</p>
      <p>Do you think NXT will reign supreme at Survivor Series 2019?</p>
