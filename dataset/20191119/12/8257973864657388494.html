      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- The Taliban on Tuesday freed two Western hostages after three years in captivity, including an American professor, in exchange for three insurgents captured during the long-running war in <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/War_in_Afghanistan/?tps=1">Afghanistan</a>.</p>
      <p>American Kevin C. King, 63, and Australian Timothy J. Weeks, 50, who both taught at American University in Kabul before they were kidnapped in 2016, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/world/asia/afghanistan-taliban-prisoner-exchange-peace-talks.html">were released</a> to American special operations forces.</p>
      <p>In return, the <a href="https://tolonews.com/afghanistan/two-westerner-auaf-professors-freed">Afghan government released</a> insurgent Anas Haqqani, the brother of a Taliban leader; Hafiz <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Abdul_Rashid/?tps=1">Abdul Rashid</a>, a senior Taliban commander held since 2014; and Hajji Mali Khan, a senior commander and uncle to a Taliban deputy. They were flown to Qatar, where the Taliban has a political office.</p>
      <p>The exchange was made after Afghan President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Ashraf_Ghani/?tps=1">Ashraf Ghani</a> consulted with U.S. Secretary of State <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mike-Pompeo/?tps=1">Mike Pompeo</a> and national security adviser Robert O'Brien. The releases were negotiated by U.S. envoy <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Zalmay_Khalilzad/?tps=1">Zalmay Khalilzad</a>, who's been working with the Taliban for months on a possible peace deal to end 18 years of U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan. Ghani announced the conditional trade <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/11/12/Afghanistan-exchanges-Taliban-members-for-abducted-US-professors/8041573548704/">last week</a>.</p>
      <p>Some Afghan lawmakers criticized the release of three captured Taliban -- particularly Haqqani, whose father Jalaluddin Haqqani is the founder of the Haqqani militant network.</p>
      <p>"The decision to release Anas Haqqani makes clear one point: That other countries and other people are making decisions in this country, not the government," Afghan lawmaker Ali Akbar Jamshidi <a href="https://tolonews.com/index.php/afghanistan/mixed-reactions-imminent-release-haqqani-prisoners">said</a>.</p>
