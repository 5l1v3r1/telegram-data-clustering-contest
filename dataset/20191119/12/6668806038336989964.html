      <h1>Trailer Review: Tanhaji The Unsung Warrior</h1>

      <p>We’re being spoilt for choices with epic battle dramas. After the release of Panipat’s trailer, we’re served another grand historical drama with Tanhaji The Unsung Warrior. Starring Ajay Devgn in the titular role, Tanhaji takes you back to the 17<sup>th</sup> century battle between the Marathas and the Mughals. Tanhaji Malusare was the leader of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s army and lead his men into battle against Uday Bhan, played by Saif Ali Khan in this biopic. The film also stars Kajol as Tanhaji’s wife Savitribai Malusare. </p>

      <p>While the film gives you distinctive aesthetics that will not give rise to comparisons like Panipat and Bajirao Mastani, the trailer does not give you an insight into grand sets or the battle sequence. The trailer is all about introducing the characters and it does that pretty well. What it misses is to give you a unique angle of the story. The whole talking about a problem, then introducing the saviour hero a little into the runtime of the trailer is a narrative done to death. But moving forward, we witness what is one of the biggest attacks by the Maratha army with cinematic shots, a bit of CGI and intense dialogues in the trailer. We sure missed seeing a little more of Kajol whose character is not very well established or even talked about in the trailer, but we love the little of this superstar we see. </p>

      <p>Ajay Devgn fits the role of the unsung hero with his macho looks, imppessable screen presense and that physique. Saif Ali Khan stands out as the mad man and we are convinced that he will create havoc in the story. All in all, it might take time for you to get accustomed to Ajay and Kajol in these historic roles but the two around bound to grow on you. </p>
