      <h2>Auditor says system faults to blame.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:57:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/author/justin-hendry-1167397" target="_blank">Justin Hendry</a></address>
      <p>Victoria’s Department of Justice and Community Safety has been forced to write down almost half the cost of its troubled new fines IT system, the state’s auditor-general has revealed.</p>
      <p>Ongoing problems with the centralised fine system, most recently around <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/victoria-govt-owed-hundreds-of-millions-after-latest-issues-with-fines-it-system-532848">merging data from the court fines system</a>, has also seen the department spend millions more developing workarounds.</p>
      <p>In an annual audit of the government’s finances last week, the auditor cited the issues for a $21 million write-down against the infringements enforcement and warrants (VIEW) system last year.</p>
      <p>“During 2018-19, DJCS wrote down $20.8 million of the $45.2 million spent because aspects of the system were not working,” the audit [<a href="https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-11/20191113-AFR-2018-19.pdf">pdf</a>] states.</p>
      <p>Issues with VIEW date back to December 2017, when the government decided to set-live a partially operational version of the system – <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/victoria-tries-again-with-103m-fines-system-overhaul-441303">developed by Civica at a cost of $103 million</a> – and add functionality iteratively.</p>
      <p>According to the state’s Ombudsman, this decision – which was made despite the existence of a go-live extension – immediately “led to a significant rise in activity and resulting processing backlogs”.</p>
      <p>Since then the number of <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/victorias-fines-it-system-blamed-for-skyrocketing-complaints-524024">complaints regarding Fines Victoria has soared</a> by 74 percent, with the Ombudsman receiving 605 complaints about the agency during 2018.</p>
      <p>The auditor-general cites multiple issues with the system identified last year, the majority of which it said “remained unresolved” as at the end of June 2019.</p>
      <p>These issues include a broken interface with Court Services Victoria, control weaknesses and a “significant backlog in processing infringements”.</p>
      <p>“This meant that the newly formed DJCS had to develop a workaround to ensure that the financial statements were not materially misstated,” the auditor said.</p>
      <p>“Business functionality and system defects have significantly delayed the delivery of the system and a revised delivery date is yet to be determined.”</p>
      <p>The $21 million write down bares some resemblance to the department <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/victoria-tries-again-with-103m-fines-system-overhaul-441303">failed first attempt</a> to replace the legacy infringement and warrants system, which resulted in a $60 million write-off.</p>
      <p>The government has provided an additional $8.1 million to the department to develop workarounds and assist with delivery.</p>
      <p>Most recently, issues around merging the court fines system into VIEW have hampered the government’s ability to <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/victoria-govt-owed-hundreds-of-millions-after-latest-issues-with-fines-it-system-532848">collect up to $700 million in revenue</a> from outstanding fines.</p>
