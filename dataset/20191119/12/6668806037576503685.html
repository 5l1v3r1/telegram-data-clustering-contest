      <p>The wait is finally over as the makers of Ajay Devgn, Saif Ali Khan, and Kajol starrer Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior have released the trailer of the film. One look at it and you know it’s truly excellent. Set in the 17th-century era, the period drama also stars Sharad Kelkar, Luke Kenny and Padmavati Rao in interesting roles. Based on the life of Tanaji Malusare and the military leader in the army of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the film had been making a lot of noise ever since it’s announcement. </p>
      <p>Present at the trailer launch of the film, our shutterbugs snapped the entire cast and crew sans Kajol as they posed together and talked about the project. It was just two days ago before the trailer release when Ajay had unveiled one final promo which got all his fans excited. Ecstatic about the big day, both Ajay and Saif were seen bonding and having a great time together. Looking super handsome, Saif opted for an olive green suit which he paired with a white shirt. Meanwhile, Ajay along with his co-stars and Rohit Shetty, Bhushan Kumar wore black shirts with trousers.</p>
