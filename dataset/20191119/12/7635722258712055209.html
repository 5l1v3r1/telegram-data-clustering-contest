        <b>A student who claims she developed narcolepsy after taking the swine flu vaccine has settled her case in the High Court.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aoife Bennett from Naas, Co Kildare told the court she couldn't get out of bed after getting the vaccine and was eventually diagnosed with the sleep disorder.</p>
      <p>This case began last month and was expected to take up to ten weeks at a cost of millions of euro.</p>
      <p>However, when the court reconvened this morning, Mr Justice Michael McGrath was told it had been settled.</p>
      <p>26-year-old Aoife Bennett gave evidence from a special comfortable chair in the early stages of the hearing.</p>
      <p>She told the court she thought she was doing the right thing when she got the vaccine in the midst of a threatened swine flu pandemic in late 2009.</p>
      <p>On Christmas Day that year, she said she had to drag herself downstairs for Christmas dinner.</p>
      <p>She said she was “absolutely exhausted” and had lost all her energy.</p>
      <p>She was diagnosed with the sleep disorder narcolepsy in 2011.</p>
      <p>She claimed she had been misled about the safety of the vaccine and ill-informed of the potential risks.</p>
      <p>Aoife’s case was settled with no admission of liability and the details of the settlement were not revealed in court.</p>
      <p>Outside court afterwards, her mother Mary described it as a “landmark case”.</p>
      <p>She said: "This vaccine was promoted by the State, and she was just 16 years old and in the prime of her life.</p>
      <p>"This is a landmark case, and it was extremely difficult task for Aoife to take on the might of the State and the might of a large multinational company... while at the same time coping day to day with her illness."</p>
