        <b>The Brexit Party’s sole MEP in Scotland has quit the party, claiming it was no longer “committed” to Brexit and had allowed a candidate who posted homophobic views to be selected.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Louis Stedman-Bryce, who was elected six months ago, said he would sit as an independent MEP.</p>
      <p>His decision comes just a week after he revealed he was quitting as a general election candidate for the Brexit Party in Glasgow North East in protest at Nigel Farage’s decision to stand down his candidates in all 317 seats the Conservatives are defending.</p>

          <b>Scottish Brexit Party MEP with ‘heavy heart’ stands down in protest</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>In a video message shared today, the MEP said: “This week it saddens me further to say that I’ve taken the decision to leave the Brexit Party.</p>
      <p>“This is because I find myself in a situation where my personal values are now in direct conflict with those of the party.</p>
      <p>“And this for me is an area where I cannot and will not compromise.</p>
      <p>“Almost a quarter of a million people in Scotland voted for the Brexit Party to represent them here in the European Parliament and to ensure that Scotland had a voice in the Brexit debate.</p>
      <p>“But unfortunately I feel the party has repeatedly failed to deliver on either of those promises.”</p>
      <p>On Monday, the Brexit Party withdrew support for its candidate in the Fife constituency of Glenrothes after he was accused of “rampant homophobia”.</p>

      <p>In a Facebook post to an account in his name, evangelical pastor Victor Robert Farrell wrote in 2017: “Western nations look at your hands. Young lesbians in parliament, old lesbians leading political parties. Perverts pushing sodomite rights. The aged living in fear.”</p>
      <p>A Brexit Party spokesman said: “The Brexit Party does not share these views. We have withdrawn our support for the candidate.”</p>

      <p>Mr Farrell did not respond to The Scotsman’s request for comment.</p>
      <p>In his statement, Mr Stedman-Bryce continued: “The Brexit Party’s recent decision to select a Scottish candidate who has openly posted homophobic views across social media is not only a betrayal of the LGBT community, but also a betrayal of everyone who believes that such divisive and hateful views have no place in our society.</p>
      <p>“Whilst the Brexit Party’s position on Brexit may have changed, mine has not, and I remain committed to Brexit and to the people of SCotland who voted for me and I will fight on unhindered as an independent MEP to ensure our voice is heard.”</p>
