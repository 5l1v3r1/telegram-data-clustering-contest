      <p><b>Best answer:</b> Unfortunately, there's no location where you can try out a Secretlab chair right now. However, some are coming soon.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The latest models: <a href="https://secretlab.co/collections?rfsn=1884149.79e6b&amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=1884149.79e6b">Secretlab 2020 Series</a> (From $329 at Secretlab)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>So, when are locations coming?</h4>
      <p>Sadly, there's no official word on when <i>specifically</i> places where you can try out some of Secretlab's chairs for yourself are going to be available to visit. However, we do know that they're coming sooner rather than later due to the fact that Secretlab is currently securing the locations, according to its <a href="https://secretlab.co/pages/faq?rfsn=1884149.79e6b&amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=1884149.79e6b">FAQ</a>. Hopefully Secretlab gives us some news in the near future.</p>
      <p>If you're worried about how to know which chair size is right for you, Secretlab has a helpful interactive <a href="https://secretlab.co/collections?rfsn=1884149.79e6b&amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=1884149.79e6b#sizing-guide">sizing guide</a> on its website that lets you input your height and weight. Then, the site will automatically direct you towards the chair that will fit you the best.</p>
      <h4>Why buy Secretlab?</h4>

      <p>Secretlab chairs are known for being some of the most comfortable gaming chairs out there, featuring extremely high-quality materials such as grade-A PU leather, very adjustable designs, and super durable frames that can stand up to a ton of weight.</p>
      <p>We got a chance to get our hands on one of the new 2020 Series models in a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/secretlab-2020-series-gaming-chair-review">review</a> earlier this year, and we loved how enjoyable it was to use. While they tend to be on the pricey side, they are more than worth the cost since the quality is so high. Out of all of the different types of gaming chairs out there, we recommend Secretlab's the most.</p>
      <p>Secretlabs offers three different types of chairs, with each one designed to accommodate a different weight and height. As stated above, using Secretlab's online sizing guide is the perfect way to figure out which chair is just right for you.</p>
