      <h1>What is Mary is holding on to in this NSFW stained glass window?</h1>

      <p>Picture the scene: You kneel before the Priest (not in a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fleabag/">Fleabag</a> way) and open your mouth to receive the body of Christ in the form of a little tasteless wafer.</p>
      <p>You look up in reverence at the sacrifice made by Jesus to save us all from our sins.</p>
      <p>But, what you’re looking up at isn’t Christ on the crucifix or a mere altar. No, you’re looking up at a stained glass window that appears to show a very different part of the body of Christ.</p>
      <p>Twitter user Rosievix was at a service this Sunday and noticed this rather unfortunate effort at shading</p>
      <p>In a tweet, they wrote: ‘What, exactly…, is Mary holding ??’ You’re asking us.</p>

      <p>What the artist seemed to be getting at was some sort of imagining of The Pietà by Michaelangelo.</p>

      <p>In this sculpture, the Virgin Mary is seen holding her son in her arms after he was crucified.</p>
      <p>However, this artist – in an effort to show the darker shading in Jesus’ inner thigh – has accidentally made it look like he’s packing a Bratwurst in his robes.</p>
      <p>There obviously wasn’t some sort of blasphemy checker in residence when the piece was installed in the currently-unidentified church. Commenters on the original tweet also seem similarly unbothered by the potential they may be smote for their impiety.</p>
      <p>One commenter replied: ‘You can’t spell resurrection without… erm… urrection.’</p>
      <p>Another said: ‘The second coming?’ which was countered with a suggestion that this depicted ‘The staff of life.’</p>

      <p>Further sacrilege took place when this other stained window – of Jesus and John the Baptist – was posted as a reply.</p>
      <p>Basically, instead of passing around a collection bucket for a new roof, these places of worship are going to have to ask for donations to fix their NSFW windows.</p>
      <p>That stands for Not Safe for Worship, if you didn’t know.</p>
