      <h1>Royal Navy's 'secret weapon' at centre of huge exercise in Middle East</h1>
      <h2>RFA Cardigan Bay has become the 'United Nations of Divers’ for IMX 19</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:59:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:59</time> by <a rel="author">Max Channon</a></address>
      <p>Royal Navy warships - and a support ship dubbed the UK armed forces’ secret weapon - are playing key roles in a huge exercise in the Middle East.</p>
      <p>An RN spokesperson said that more than 5,000 personnel, and 30 ships from more than 50 nations are committed to the fortnight-long IMX 19 (International Maritime Exercise) workout - the largest naval exercise in the Middle East of the year.</p>
      <p>Spread across a vast area, from the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean and Gulf, the mine hunting exercise is the largest global hunt for mines in three years.</p>
      <p>HMS Brocklesby and HMS Ledbury, two of the four British minehunters permanently based in the Middle East, are involved in the exercise, alongside battle staff, a specialist dive team - and Royal Fleet Auxiliary support ship RFA Cardigan Bay.</p>
      <p>"The latter normally acts as a mothership to the Royal Navy’s minehunters, providing them with fuel, food and ammo to sustain operations for extended periods," said an RN spokesperson.</p>

      <p>"Instead, for the duration of the exercise – the third such international meeting of minds on mines – she has become the ‘United Nations of Divers’ with teams from ten different nations embarked, including the UK’s Fleet Diving Unit 3, their focus on the ‘underwater battle’ in finding, identifying and neutralising any mines found beneath the surface of the Gulf."</p>
      <p>RFA Cardigan Bay’s Commanding Officer, Captain Karl Woodfield, said: "I like to think of my ship as the UK armed forces’ secret weapon – she’s incredibly versatile, whether she’s supporting the minehunters or hosting divers and their equipment from ten different nations.</p>
      <p>"It’s great having 130 different military personnel from ten different nations on my ship, all working together. It’s a fantastic opportunity to build on old partnerships, forge new ones, make new friends."</p>
      <p>Commander Simon Cox is in charge of the British battle staff based aboard RFA Cardigan Bay, directing the dive team element of the exercise.</p>
      <p>“When you have all the plates spinning together, it makes it pretty exciting,” said Cdr Cox.</p>

      <p>"This exercise has grown enormously since those held in 2014 and 2016. This has been 18 months in the planning with more nations taking part than before.</p>
      <p>“Mines remain a threat. A mine costing relatively little can inflict damage far beyond its cost.”</p>
      <p>Fleet Diving Unit 3, normally based at Horsea Island in Portsmouth, but with a permanent three-strong team supporting Royal Navy operations in the Gulf – will also also ‘exploit’ mines, safely recovering the devices for investigation to help colleagues cope should they encounter them in the future.</p>
      <p>The divers deployed en masse to Bahrain to join the auxiliary, bringing with them a portable recompression chamber to practise recovering and treating any diver brought to the surface suffering from the bends.</p>
      <p>In November the water temperature (30C) is higher than the air temperature (28C) – the heat poses the biggest challenge to both the divers and their equipment.</p>
      <p>A team of divers from Yokohama in Japan, led by Lieutenant Koji Oda, operates much of the same equipment as their British counterparts, such as the REMUS automated sonar scanner. However, the  the French Navy have brought impressive hand-held sonars which give divers a real-time scan of the seabed in front of them.</p>

      <p>And the US Navy have deployed both divers and remote-controlled fast boats towing sonar which can find mines without putting a human being in the danger zone… but cannot yet neutralise the threat.</p>
