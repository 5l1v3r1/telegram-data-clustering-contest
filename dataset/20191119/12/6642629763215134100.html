      <p>Public hearings in US House of Representatives' <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/190926061142695.html">impeachment inquiry</a> of President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> got under way last week, marking a new phase in the probe. </p>
      <p>The impeachment inquiry is <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/190926130726931.html">centred</a> on a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which the US president asked the Ukrainian leader to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, who is also a frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic presidential race and his son, Hunter, who had served on the border of a Ukrainian gas company. The request came as Trump withheld nearly $400m in military aid to Ukraine, prompting speculation that the US president was using the money as leverage for the investigation. </p>

      <p>There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens. Trump maintains there was no quid pro quo (Latin for "favour for a favour") and has labelled the impeachment inquiry a "witch-hunt". </p>
