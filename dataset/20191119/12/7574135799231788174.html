      <p><b>Basia Bulat</b> will release new album <a href="https://found.ee/BB_AYIL"><i>Are You In Love?</i></a> on March 27 via Secret City. Like on 2016’s <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/basia-bulat-ann/"><i>Good Advice</i></a>, she worked with <b>Jim James</b> on this one and the first single is the the spirited “Your Girl.” Basia says the song came from extremes, written in Montreal during a snowstorm and recorded in Joshua Tree, CA. “Someone once told me you can’t sing and cry at the same time but that wasn’t true for me when we were recording this one,” Basia says. “There’s joy in finally being free from a painful situation, relief, laughter—even as it feels impossible to ever forget the pain or understand why that storm came through your life the way it did. And so, light on your feet, you dance with the memory instead.” Watch the Brian Sokolowski-directed video below.</p>
      <p>Basia will support the new album with a 2020 tour that kicks off in Austin for SXSW and includes shows in Chicago, Nashville, D.C., NYC, Philadelphia, Toronto, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and more. The NYC show happens at <a href="https://www.axs.com/events/387798/basia-bulat-tickets"><b>Music Hall of Williamsburg on April 10</b></a> and <a href="https://www.axs.com/events/387798/basia-bulat-tickets"><b>tickets</b></a> go on sale Friday, November 22 at 10 AM with various presales starting Wednesday (11/20) at 10 AM.</p>
