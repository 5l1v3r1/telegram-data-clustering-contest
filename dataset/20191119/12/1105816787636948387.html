      <p><b>KARACHI: </b>It’s been a year of star-studded weddings as some of our favourite celebrities tied the knot in beautiful ceremonies that had us swooning. One thing we loved the most about this year was seeing more simple and glowing brides who seemed to have a ball at their<i> shaadis</i>.</p>
      <p>We can’t forget Hamza Ali Abbasi getting married to his gorgeous bride Naimal Khawar in August and boy, did she knock us all over with her natural beauty! Most notably, Naimal did her own makeup keeping it understated yet elegant and looked like the definition of a radiant bride.</p>

      <p>Celebrated designer Ali Xeeshan also surprised us all after tying the knot with educationalist Myrah Khan and everyone was, well, simply stunned. Not only did her gold and blush pink colour palette make us feel dreamy, she also kept her makeup simple and sophisticated.</p>
      <p>Social media also went gaga over actor Mira Seethi recently marrying her long-time fiancé in a simple yet stunning ceremony over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Let’s take a closer look at how these ladies made 2019’s most simple yet stunning brides.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Naimal Khawar Abbasi </b>

      <p>Didn’t she just take our breaths away? Naimal dazzled in the soft sunlight during her <i>nikkah</i> ceremony. We adored how she reused her mother’s bridal wear with a few adjustments. The bride certainly looked timeless, exuding old world charm.</p>

      <p>The new bride opted for simple makeup and we think it was the best part of her nikkah look. She had fresh and glowing skin, with flushed cheeks and almost bare eyes. It’s the very definition of a ‘blushing bride’ and that’s always the best thing to opt for.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Myrah Ali Xeeshan</b>
      </p>

      <p>While Ali shocked us all with his surprise wedding, it was the designer’s bride that took our breath away. Showing up in a soft blush pink and gold creation by her husband, of course, we can’t get over how the demure colours amped her beauty even more.</p>

      <p>Again, Myrah kept her makeup dewy, making her look elegant and ethereal. Since the outfit was heavily embellished, the bride added the right amount of statement jewelry pieces to not look overboard.</p>

        <b>Mira Sethi</b>
      </p>

      <p>Quite literally, the actor “scooped her hair into a ponytail and married the love of my life,” as she wrote on Instagram. Mira tied the knot in a simple yet beautiful ceremony in California, uploading some stunning shots on Instagram.</p>

      <p>For one of the events, Mira was clad in a red Élan creation. She kept her hair fresh and makeup minimal. But the Kamiar Rokni ensemble she wore to her reception was the perfect definition of class and understated elegance. She looked graceful in a neat updo and traditional jewellery with the main focus being the worked dupatta.</p>
