      <h1>Price of Natural Gas Futures: Second day of slump amid milder weather, uptrend intact</h1>

          <b>Milder US weather has been undermining demand and weighing on prices.</b>

          <b>Tuesday's daily chart is pointing to an uptrend with higher highs and higher lows.</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Large swathes of the southern United States are experiencing hot and dry weather. The above-normal weather encompasses areas from Houston Texas to Portland, Oregon. The "<b>Pacific Blob</b>" is set to keep the mercury above average, but below the persistent heat experienced in 2015.</p>
      <p>The warm wave comes after a <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/natural-gas-price-news-record-smashing-freeze-higher-lows-behind-bullish-outlook-201911111613">cold snap </a>and <b>diminishes the demand for heating gas</b>. Prices of natural gas – which have been on the rise last week – are declining to the lowest levels since October 28. </p>
      <p>It is important to note that the Northeast continues experiencing colder weather, with advisories issued for nine states. Another wave of harsh weather may eventually engulf North America.</p>
