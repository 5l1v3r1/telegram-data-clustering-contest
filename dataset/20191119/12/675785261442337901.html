      <h1>Man Utd players warned to stay indoors during Europa League trip to Astana</h1>
      <h2>Man Utd players are set to feel the cold when they play Astana in the Champions League and have been told not to go outside for more than 10 minutes</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> players have been told to avoid going outside when they travel to Kazakhstan to play Astana.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are having to make the 7,000 mile trip to eastern Europe for a Europa League clash.</p>
      <p>But the game is set to be played in minus 20 degrees Celsius, although the 30,000 seater stadium does have a roof to keep players protected from the elements.</p>
      <p>United players though have been told not to be outside for more than 10 minutes as they prepare for their clash at the Astana Arena, reports <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/manchester-united/story/3993532/sources-manchester-united-players-told-to-stay-indoors-at-astana">ESPN</a> .</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side have already qualified for the knockout stages having won three of their four group L games, but a win against Astana could see United top the group should results go their way.</p>

      <p>Astana lost 1-0 at Old Trafford the last time the teams met with a Mason Greenwood strike settling the contest.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer is likely to give more of his youth players a chance to impress with the likes of David de Gea, Harry Maguire and Marcus Rashford due to be rested.</p>
      <p>Next week's Europa League trip begins a cruel run of fixtures that will see United face Aston Villa, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> in the space of seven days.</p>

      <p>Solskjaer has seen his side win two of their last three in the Premier League to rise up the table to seventh.</p>
      <p>In all competitions United have lost just one of their last seven with wins coming against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> , Norwich and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> .</p>
      <p>But off the pitch they have been dealt a blow after announcing their annual revenue is likely to fall by £67m after they failed to qualify for this season's Champions League.</p>
      <p>United anticipate that their 2020 annual revenue will be down this year to somewhere between £560-580million, compared to £627.1million for the year ending June 30, 2019.</p>
