      <p>A Bristol curry house is in the running to be crowned one of the best in the UK at a prestigious awards event.</p>
      <p>Urban Tandoor is certainly no stranger to awards <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/english-curry-awards-urban-tandoor-3236324">having picked up numerous accolades</a> in recent years and next week it could add to its glistening trophy cabinet.</p>
      <p>The Small Street restaurant, run by Sujith D'almeida, has been shortlisted for Best Restaurant in the South West at the British Curry Awards, held in association with Just Eat.</p>
      <p>It was in contention to win the award last year too but was pipped to the post by Koloshi in Cheltenham.</p>

      <p>The Bristol restaurant will be among the finest from across the UK to attend the ceremony at Battersea Evolution on November 25, in the hope of being recognised as the best in the region.</p>
      <p>Sujith said: "We are very happy to be nominated at this prestigious curry awards for the third time in a row, considering it is the Oscars of the curry industry we are honoured to participate once again.</p>
      <p>"The Urban Tandoor team is excited and we hope we can bring the trophy to Bristol this time.</p>
      <p>"As always, we would like to say a big thank you to all our guests and staff."</p>

      <p>This year marks the 15th anniversary of the British Curry Awards.</p>
      <p>The ceremony will once again welcome a guest list of leading names from the worlds of politics, sport, film, television and entertainment alongside celebrity chefs, curry house owners and their staff from across the country.</p>
      <p>Former attendees have included high profile guests such as Boris Johnson, David Cameron, Theresa May, David Seaman, Russell Brand and Heston Blumenthal.</p>
      <p>British Curry Awards founder Enam Ali MBE said: "I am so very grateful to local curry restaurant diners who, every year, take the effort to nominate their favourite restaurants for the British Curry Awards, and who provide us with their vital feedback, letting us know about the best service, the best curry cuisine and other factors for consideration.</p>
      <p>"Only with their feedback can their local restaurants also continue to optimise quality of the service they provide.</p>
      <p>"It is the opinions and feedback of local diners that is paramount, and of far more significance that a critic’s review or a Michelin star rating."</p>
