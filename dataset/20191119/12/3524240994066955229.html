      <h1>Thousands in Philippines flee Typhoon Kalmaegi</h1>

      <p>At least 5,000 people have fled their homes with Typhoon Kalmaegi poised to blast into the northern Philippines late Tuesday, with a second tropical storm forecast to hit just days later.</p>
      <p>Kalmaegi is expected to batter the nation’s lightly populated far north with 120 kilometre (75 mile) per hour winds, the national weather service said.</p>
      <p>Heavy rains are forecast to swell rivers, cut off roads and threaten low-lying communities in Cagayan province, where officials guided residents towards shelter.</p>
      <p>“We’re expecting falling trees and houses that could be inundated by floods,” provincial police chief Ariel Quilang told AFP.</p>
      <p>Forecasters believe a second tropical storm could make landfall in the same province by Thursday.</p>
      <p>The disaster-prone nation is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year, killing hundreds and condemning many areas in their path to perpetual poverty.</p>
      <p>The weather bureau raised landslide warnings across the mountainous interior of the country’s north, also warning of floods and waves up to two metres (6.5 feet) high in coastal areas.</p>
      <p>At least a dozen domestic flights have been cancelled and schools shut down due to Kalmaegi, while small sea vessels were ordered to stay ashore with gale conditions forecast at sea.</p>
      <p>The Philippines’ deadliest cyclone on record was Super Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.</p>
