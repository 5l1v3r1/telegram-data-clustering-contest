      <h3>THE Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) has assured Vice President Leni Robredo of full support and cooperation in the fight against illegal drugs and making her succeed in this daunting task as co-chair of the Inter-Agency Committee on Illegal Drugs (ICAD).</h3>
      <p>“We are one with the Vice President in this difficult journey of ending the illegal drugs problem in our country that has destroyed the lives of our youth, destroyed so many families, and shattered the future of so many of our countrymen,” DILG Undersecretary and spokesperson Jonathan Malaya said in a statement.</p>
      <p>According to Malaya, Secretary Eduardo Ano together with the heads of all of DILG’s attached agencies, had a long and fruitful talk with the Vice President yesterday on the need to synergize, synchronize and harmonize all the efforts of the various ICAD member-agencies.</p>
      <p>The DILG briefed Robredo on the government’s campaign against illegal drugs and listened to some thoughts from her on the future steps to combat the proliferation of drugs in the country.</p>
      <p>Malaya said that there may be perceived differences in so far as the strategies, policies, and programs are concerned but at the end of the day, what binds ICAD together is the commitment to eradicate the drug problem for the sake of present and future generations.</p>
      <p>“We are grateful that the Vice President has expressed her commitment to support DILG’s programs to fight illegal drugs particularly on the demand-reduction aspect and for expressing support for the Community Based Drug Rehabilitation Program,” he added.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the DILG official also expressed appreciation for Robredo’s initiatives to interact and engage with different sectors such as the Church and other faith-based groups which could then tap their huge network and followers to serve as advocates and volunteers in support of the anti-illegal drugs campaign of the administration.</p>
      <p>The DILG also promised to support her proposal to create a Technical Working Group that will be tasked to study, review, and recommend bills or legislative measures that will further enhance the government’s capacity to fight illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>The DILG agreed that all amendments to existing laws and policies need to be harmonized and packaged as one when submitted to Congress.</p>
      <p>“We look forward to more discussions with her and the rest of the ICAD members in reviewing and fast tracking the process of delisting drug surrenderers as well as in securing more funds for community-based drug rehabilitation and improving the capacities of anti-drug abuse councils on the local government level,” Malaya said.</p>
