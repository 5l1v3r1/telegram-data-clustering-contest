      <p>The Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) said on Tuesday that it would not budge on its demand of a complete rollback of the hostel-fee hike.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Addressing the media, several students who were part of the protest on Monday complained against police brutality and alleged that women protesters were manhandled and molested by the force.</p>
      <p>JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh said, “Such brutality has not been seen in the recent past. But this movement is for a just cause. Today is the 23<sup>rd</sup> day of our protest and yet neither the VC nor the administration has come forth for any dialogue.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Ghosh said, “We have been told that the Registrar has refused to meet the high-powered committee. If this is the condition then how will justice be provided to the students? Why should we end the strike?”</p>
