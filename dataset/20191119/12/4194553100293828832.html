      <h1>Pep Lijnders comments on Liverpool’s ‘Only Pressure’ are beautiful</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:16:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool will be in safe hands after Jurgen Klopp eventually departs.</p>
      <p>That’s if Pep Lijnders’ management is half as good as his ability to portray our team’s identity in his interviews.</p>
      <p>There’s obviously no confirmation he’ll take the reigns, but the manner in which he has risen up to coaching ranks under Klopp’s guidance suggest he’ll be a great candidate at the very least.</p>
      <p>Lijnders has been discussing the team’s mentality and the pressure of the title race, wonderfully suggesting that the only ‘pressure’ the side feels is the pressure to help your team-mate.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Dutchman told the <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/373491-pepijn-lijnders-liverpool-culture-perfection">official Liverpool FC magazine</a>: “Purely the mentality of the boys in the hard, hard moments, never giving up and never giving up our playing style. Never complaining or making excuses on the training pitch.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“I love how we tell our team every day that we are capable of becoming really great as long as we focus and we don’t drop concentration – we need to maintain 100 per cent tactical discipline in our way.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“That’s why I think these last few games were incredible in all aspects. We have to keep the same hunger and passion to win but at the same time understand that it’s much more important that we stay focused on how we play and play our way, whatever the scoreline, wherever we play and whoever we play against.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“We must never leave someone alone and need to help the player who is chasing from all directions. That should be the only pressure: to help your teammate.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>The attitude of this Liverpool team really is second to none.</p>
      <p>It’s been shown not only in our many unbelievable comebacks and late goals – but also in our relentless consistency.</p>
      <p>it takes a truly special team to win the Champions League in the same season as racking up 97 points domestically, then to start the next campaign in a similar vein with no new first-team arrivals.</p>
      <p>The Reds face Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon, perhaps without Mo Salah and Andy Robertson – both of who are carrying knocks.</p>
      <p>Hopefully James Milner and Divock Origi, the likely replacements, will be able to replace them.</p>
