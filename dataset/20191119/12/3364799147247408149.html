      <p>The hedge-fund manager Russell Clark stands to win big from a market crash. But <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-today-sp-500-dow-nasdaq-post-record-highs-2019-11-1028694022?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">record-setting stocks</a> haven't been kind to his bearish investments.</p>
      <p>The Horseman Global Fund manager raised his portfolio's net short position to 111% of gross assets, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/">Bloomberg</a> reported on Tuesday, citing an investor letter sent Monday. Clark has been regularly shorting stocks since 2012, according to Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>The London-based manager is actively betting against the longest bull run in history, as central-bank rate cuts and trade-war optimism fuel new market peaks. The <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/s&amp;p_500?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">S&amp;P 500</a>, the <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/nasdaq_100?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Nasdaq Composite</a>, and the <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/dow_jones?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> all closed at record highs on Monday, bucking summer fears of an economic recession.</p>
      <p>Bearish investors are now faced with two options: double down on a market contraction, or exit before rising stocks further damage their positions. Clark says that the market exhibits several signs of a crash coming and that bearish investors simply need to be patient.</p>
      <p>"I can see all the problems with the markets, and I can see how they will unwind, and how we will make money from it," the fund manager told Horseman clients in October. "The issue is timing."</p>
      <p>Up to this point, Clark has been a few years early to the bear-market party. His fund tumbled 24% in 2016 after years of double-digit gains, according to Bloomberg. Horseman is on track for its biggest annual loss yet, having lost 27% year-to-date. The fund's assets have fallen to $263 million from $1.7 billion in 2015, Bloomberg reported.</p>
      <p>Despite Horseman's losses and record-high stock indexes, many of the world's richest have sided with Clark in his economic pessimism. Most of the wealthiest investors anticipate <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/ubs-investor-watch-majority-see-significant-stock-drop-high-volatility-in-2020-2019-11-1028681734?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">a "significant" market slump in 2020</a>, a <a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/ubs-news/r-news-display-ndp/en-20191112-investor-watch.html">UBS Global Wealth Management survey</a> published November 12 found. Of the 3,400 investors surveyed, 25% of their average assets were in cash, and roughly 60% of respondents said they'd consider increasing their cash reserves.</p>
      <p>"Business fundamentals that once were the backbone of how investors think about the market are now being usurped by a confusing geopolitical landscape. As a result, investors are now less likely to act," UBS said.</p>
      <p>Markets could also be driven lower by the simple theory of economic cycles, Clark said in an October letter, according to Bloomberg. The record-long expansion has led many to grow concerned about an upcoming contraction, and the manager's strategy could be a rare winner should a recession tear into global markets.</p>
      <p>"The investing world at large is about to discover the pitfalls of levered long investing at the end of the cycle," Clark wrote in October. "Exciting times ahead."</p>
