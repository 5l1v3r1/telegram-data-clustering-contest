      <h1>USD/INR Technical Analysis: Bears challenge 38.2% Fibo./200-hour SMA confluence support</h1>

          <b>The pair failed to capitalize on the previous session’s positive move.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Break below 71.65-60 support should pave the way for further slide.</b>

      </ul>
      <p>After an initial uptick to levels beyond the 72.00 handle, the USD/INR pair came under some renewed selling pressure and has now eroded a major part of the previous session's gains.<br/> <br/>The downtick, also marking the third day of a negative move in the previous four, dragged the pair back closer to a support marked by 38.2% <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> level of the 70.53-72.37 move up.<br/> <br/>The mentioned region coincides with 200-hour SMA and is closely followed by a two-week-old ascending trend-line support, which if broken might be seen as a key trigger for bearish traders.<br/> <br/>The pair then could accelerate the slide towards the 71.20 region – 61.8% Fibo. – and the downward trajectory could further get extended towards testing sub-71.00 levels in the near term.<br/> <br/>On the flip side, the 71.95-72.00 region now seems to act as an immediate <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a>, which if cleared has the potential to lift the pair back towards monthly tops around the 72.35-40 region.<br/> <br/>Some follow-through buying might negate any near-term bearish bias and set the stage for a move back towards challenging September monthly peak – around the 72.65 region.</p>
