      <h1>Arsenal miss out on Luis Enrique as Spain confirm appointment of former Barcelona coach</h1>
      <h2>Luis Enrique had been linked with a move to Arsenal to replace Unai Emery</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:02:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:02</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Luis Enrique has made a sensational return to management as the Spain national team boss.</p>
      <p>Enrique vacated the post in June 2019 after the passing of his daughter Xana. Since that point, Roberto Moreno has been in charge.</p>
      <p>Now it has been revealed that Enrique has returned to management, <a href="https://twitter.com/Sport_EN/status/1196753895718035457">with President of the Royal Spanish Football Federation Luis Rubiales confirming the decision</a>.</p>
      <p>Enrique will take charge for the Euros next summer after Spain finished top of Group F in qualifying.</p>
      <p>It's a blow for Arsenal after endless speculation that Enrique could have been the man to take over at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery has endured a rough start to the season as the Gunners sit eight points off the Premier League top four.</p>
      <p>In his second season, Emery has yet to make a major impact on the club and fans are widely known to be displeased.</p>
      <p>Former Barcelona manager Enrique had been linked with the role should Emery be sacked, and reports even claimed that head of football Raul Sanllehi had made contact. But those reports have been dismissed by this latest move.</p>
      <p>Rubiales said: "I called Luis Enrique yesterday and told him that Robert would not stand in way of a return. Luis Enrique said yes, immediately, to count on him and he would be delighted. He thanked us for keeping our word.</p>
      <p>"We have always acted with respect and transparency. And we have kept our word. The federation has acted coherently with everyone. We are loyal to Luis Enrique and the person who occupied his job.</p>
