      <p><b>PHILADELPHIAÂ (AP)</b> - A Philadelphia woman has been charged with murder in the death of her adult quadriplegic daughter.</p>
      <p>Authorities say 63-year-old Yelena Nezhikhovskaya is also charged with false reporting and drug delivery resulting in death stemming from the death of her 32-year-old daughter, Yulia. She was arrested Saturday, and the charges were made public Monday.</p>
      <p>Yulia Nezhikhovskaya was pronounced dead at the family home last December. But authorities have not revealed a possible motive or cause of death.</p>
      <p>It wasn't known Tuesday if Yelena Nezhikhovskaya has retained an attorney.</p>
