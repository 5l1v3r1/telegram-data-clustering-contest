      <h1>Man calls police after being abused via Wetherspoon app</h1>
      <h2>Mark, 24, left the pub saying staff didn't treat the incident seriously and has since contacted the police</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:40:25+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:40</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Shaw</a></address>
      <p>A man has alerted police after a Wetherspoon's customer used its app to send a BANANA to his table.</p>
      <p>Mark D'arcy-Smith was sat in The Richmal Crompton in Bromley in Kent with a friend when a waiter delivered the appalling order.</p>
      <p>Bananas can be ordered for 30p on the pub chain's app and sent to any table in any Wetherspoon.</p>
      <p>Shocked Mark, 24, soon left the pub saying staff didn't treat the incident seriously and has since contacted the police.</p>
      <p>He now wants to speak out to raise awareness as he said the unpleasant incident left him feeling unwanted - in a place he'd previously felt at home.</p>
      <p>He said: "It made me feel confused, angry, lost and lonely. It was really overwhelming. All these emotions came in a matter of seconds.</p>
      <p>"I don't feel like many people understand what it feels like to be racially abused. The staff didn't take it seriously."</p>
      <p>Mark had arrived in the pub with his friend at around 8:30pm on November 8 - a usual trip on a Friday.</p>

      <p>The pair sat down and enjoyed a few drinks before the abhorrent order arrived at around 10:05pm.</p>
      <p>Wetherspoon allows its customers to order food and drinks to tables using numbers on an app - meaning you can send items anywhere unidentified.</p>
      <p>He said: "We both looked at each other then looked at the banana. It clicked that it wasn't ours. It was clearly sent by someone who was trying to be racist.</p>
      <p>"My friend went to talk to a staff member but they didn't see what the issue was. He said: 'do you know what's wrong here?'.</p>
      <p>"They thought they had brought an incorrect order. We had to explain what was wrong with that.</p>
      <p>"I was sat on my own at this point. I looked around to see if I could spot anyone. I got anxious. I think someone sent it because it was anonymous.</p>
      <p>"Two girls came over and asked if I was okay, if I was going to stay."</p>

      <p>Mark says his pal then went up to a worker at the chain pub to complain - who claimed they didn't see what the issue was.</p>
      <p>But Mark asked his friend if they could leave when he returned from talking to workers and the pair walked out.</p>
      <p>He said he returned to the pub the day after to complain again and ask what was being done but was met with a similar response - so then went to the police.</p>
      <p>But even the memory of the horrible incident now gives Mark a bad feeling in a town he's lived in for many years.</p>
      <p>He said: "When I walked past [the other day] I had this weird moment. My hands were shaking and my palms were sweating. I don't think I was very comfortable.</p>
      <p>"I had hoped they [Wetherspoon] would take the situation seriously. They just treated it like other incidents - like a bar fight."</p>
      <p>Football fan Mark added that he thinks a rise in racism in the beautiful game is fuelling the behaviour away from the stands.</p>

      <p>A Wetherspoon spokesman said: "We apologise to the customer and appreciate the distress caused. This is now a police matter.</p>
      <p>“We have responded to the customer and pointed out that the pub cannot be held responsible for app orders.”</p>
