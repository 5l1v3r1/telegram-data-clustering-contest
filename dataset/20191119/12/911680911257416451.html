      <h1>Taliban releases two hostages, including an American, as part of a prisoner swap</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:10:31+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:10</time> by <a rel="author">CNN Newsource</a></address>
      <p>On Tuesday, the Taliban <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-afghanistan-hostages/taliban-frees-us-and-australian-hostages-in-a-prisoner-swap-afghan-officials-idUKKBN1XT18J">freed two professors</a> that had been held hostage for three years — Kevin King from the United States and Timothy Weeks from Australia — as part of a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/19/780728286/taliban-frees-2-hostages-in-exchange-for-3-militants">prisoner swap,</a> according to multiple news outlets.</p>
      <p>King and Weeks are both professors with American University of Afghanistan. They were both taken from their cars as they drove near Kabul in 2016.</p>
      <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/12/asia/afghanistan-taliban-prisoners-intl/index.html">CNN</a> reported that the Taliban prisoners released in the deal were Anas Haqqani — the brother deputy Taliban leader of Sirajuddin Haqqani — Haji Mali Khan and Abdul Rashid.</p>
      <p>The prisoner exchange is an abupt about face for both sides after the Americans and the Taliban broke off peace talks in September.</p>
