      <p>Virgin Media broadband suffered a major outage today, leaving customers without any internet.</p>
      <p>Even Virgin Media’s status checker, which allows users to check the level of service in their local area, was inaccessible, with the company saying it was undertaking “essential work on our systems”.</p>

      <p>Customers vented their frustration on Twitter, with Kirsten Mairi calling the situation “ridiculous”.</p>
      <p>She added: “Internet off. Service status page down. I try calling and apparently the service is actually down ON PURPOSE for fictional ‘improvements’? No service is NOT an improvement and we received no notice of this planned outage. Absolutely unacceptable.”</p>

      <p>Steven Alcock added: “After half an hour of hanging on to phones and waiting for Chat bots to become human I am giving up on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/virginmedia?src=hashtag_click">#virginmedia</a>. Does anyone actually work there?”</p>

      <p>Virgin Media had not acknowledged the issue on its Twitter account, but replied to one user, Sue Grant: “I’m sorry to know your broadband is down and can’t check our service page as it is down as well Sue. I know how frustrating this can be on your end since you work from home and needs a reliable connection. Did rebooting makes any difference?”</p>
