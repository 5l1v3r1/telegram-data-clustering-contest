      <p>As temperatures begin to drop, spare a thought for those who have no home to go back to.</p>
      <p>But the littlest gesture can improve someone's day and there are plenty of things you can do to help the homeless in Nottingham.</p>
      <p>With this in mind, we have put together this advice as to what you can do if you are concerned about rough sleepers in Nottingham.</p>
      <h3>1. Contact a local homeless service</h3>
      <p>If you see a rough sleeper in Nottingham and want to help, you should let Framework know. This is the organisation that runs the council's Street Outreach programme.</p>
      <p>Give them the location and a brief description of the rough sleeper and they will be able to find them and offer support.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Call Framework free on 0800 066 5356 to speak to someone or leave a message</li>
        <li>Text SOT and a message to 80800</li>
        <li>Visit <a href="http://www.streetlink.org.uk/">StreetLink</a> to tell us online</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. What does the council do to help?</h3>
      <p>Nottingham City Council commissions Framework to work with rough sleepers to get off the streets and address any problems they may have.</p>
      <p>The council works with organisations such as Framework and Nottingham City Homes to provide homes for individuals and families facing homelessness.</p>
      <h3>3. Why are so many people sleeping on Nottingham's streets?</h3>
      <p>The council is legally obliged to offer help and support to anyone sleeping rough in Nottingham.</p>
      <p>However, homelessness is a complex problem and not everyone sleeping rough accepts the help that is on offer. This may be because of drug or alcohol addiction or mental health issues.</p>
      <p>According to the council, many rough sleepers on the city's streets are those who have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rejected assistance</li>
        <li>Been thrown out of shelters due to violence or drug use</li>
        <li>Refused to return to their place of origin where they can best be helped</li>
        <li>Some people you see may be professional beggars who are not homeless</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>4. Should I give them money?</h3>

      <p>This is a difficult question. According to <a href="https://www.streetlink.org.uk/">StreetLink</a>, in the long term, giving money to people who are begging may contribute to self-destructive behaviour. Alternative ways of helping the homeless include donating to or volunteering with local homelessness services.</p>
      <p>Framework, which has been working with the homeless in Nottingham since 2001, says that "in many cases individuals begging are not homeless and the money raised by begging is likely to be spent on drugs".</p>
      <h3>5. What can I do to help homeless people in Nottingham?</h3>
      <p>Giving rough sleepers food, clothes and money is not thought to be the best way to help. It may merely perpetuate a drug or alcohol addiction.</p>
      <p>If you wish to help Nottingham's homeless, the best way to do so is to donate money, food and household items to charities helping people on the city's streets.</p>
