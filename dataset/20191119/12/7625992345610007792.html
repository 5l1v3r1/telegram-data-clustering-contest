      <p>From Dr. Drew Ramsey, author of "Eat Complete: The 21 Nutrients That Fuel Brainpower, Boost Weight Loss, and Transform Your Health":</p>
      <p>"Deviled eggs are always a crowd-pleaser and are a great way to extend your relationship with eggs beyond breakfast. Here's a twist on the classic that packs more flavor and far more nutrition with the powers of mustard greens and roasted red pepper.</p>
      <p>"These are great for a snack or for lunch at work. If you prefer to roast the peppers yourself, place them on a baking sheet under the broiler for 3 to 4 minutes, turning often, until the skins are blackened. Transfer to a bowl and let them steam for 5 minutes. Then peel and seed the peppers before completing the recipe."</p>
