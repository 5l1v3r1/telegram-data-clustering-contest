      <p>Despite being the only female on her training course, Ms Cooper said she was "unphased" by the prospect and relished the challenge ahead.</p>

      <p>She went on to have a highly successful career, working as a firefighter for eight years and then being promoted to watch commander.</p>
      <p>She was formerly based at Bloxwich before working out of Walsall Fire Station at the centre's training base.</p>
      <p>Now she is looking forward to her retirement in a new "exciting chapter" of her life.</p>

      <p>She said: "On the start of the training course, there was 41 of us actually that turned up.</p>
      <p>"Me, myself, being the only female, that didn't phase me. I was quite determined for the challenge.</p>
      <p>"It was 13 weeks that we actually did. It was challenging, but it also made me feel proud achieving all what was required to actually get there.</p>

      <p>"I did seven to eight years as a firefighter, learning skills, the knowledge, operational skills.</p>
      <p>"Moving on to as a leading firefighter, I probably did that for about two, three years. Again, building the knowledge and skills at that sort of rank.</p>
      <p>"And then moving onto sub-officer, which it was back then, which is Watch Commander A.</p>

      <p>"And then I have had a great opportunity to then go into the training department. I did the recruit training back at the academy.</p>
      <p>"I really enjoyed doing the trainee training at the academy. It is so rewarding, you can pass on the skills, the experience, the knowledge that you gain over those years.</p>
      <p>"And to see them at the end, at their passing out, it is a fantastic and rewarding experience. I actually went discipline specific, which was the trauma department, and that is where I still am now.</p>

      <p>"This role within the service is so varied. It has so many opportunities for you to challenge yourself.</p>
      <p>"It is not just about riding the fire engine as a firefighter. And that keeps you driving within your career as a firefighter. It is a career, it is not just a job.</p>
      <p>"So can I be a firefighter and have a family? Yes you can. Thirty years down the line, I have got two teenage sons. I have done it, and it has worked okay.</p>
      <p>"Over thirty years I have done now and retiring, it is scary, it is exciting and new chapter in the life. It is quite surreal. I'm proud of what I have done, excited about the next chapter and got some fantastic memories."</p>
