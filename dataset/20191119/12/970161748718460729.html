      <p>Former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> captain <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/john-terry/">John Terry</a> has rubbished suggestions he told his old club not to sign Sergio Aguero shortly before the Argentine striker made his move to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a>.</p>
      <p>Aguero has been prolific in front of goal ever since moving to England and sits in sixth place in the Premier League’s all-time leading goalscorers chart with 173 goals in 250 appearances.</p>
      <p>However, things could have been very different had Chelsea followed through on their interest in Aguero a decade ago, having enquired about the forward several times.</p>

      <p>But <a href="https://theathletic.com/1383439/2019/11/18/why-chelsea-missed-out-on-signing-aguero-despite-making-him-a-target-in-2009/">a recent article in <i>The Athletic</i></a> claims skipper Terry held enormous influence at the time and gave a less than flattering appraisal of Aguero to Chelsea’s hierarchy.</p>
      <p>The defender was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/john-terry-chelsea-sergio-aguero-transfer-manchester-city-11173463/">not overly impressed</a> by the then Atletico Madrid forward’s movement – despite scoring twice against him in the Champions League – and favoured a move for Valencia’s David Villa.</p>

      <p>But Terry has hit back at the claims he effectively vetoed the deal on social media, posting on his Instagram story: ‘Where do these get the stories from?</p>
      <p>‘If they bothered calling players’ agents it would solve an awful lot of nonsense!’</p>
      <p>In the end, Chelsea signed neither Aguero nor Villa and had to settle for Daniel Sturridge, who arrived somewhat ironically from City in a £5million deal.</p>
      <p>Aguero will get another opportunity to highlight the error Chelsea made in not signing him when the two sides meet at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.</p>

      <p>The 31-year-old has scored 15 goals against the west Londoners in the Premier League – there is no side in the division he has been more prolific against – and bagged a hat-trick the last time they met in the league in a 6-0 victory for the hosts.</p>
      <p>Aguero has won the Premier League title four times since joining City, as well as the FA Cup, and needs just two more goals to equal Thierry Henry in the all-time scorers list.</p>
