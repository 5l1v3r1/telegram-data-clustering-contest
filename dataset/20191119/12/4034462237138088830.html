      <h1>Here's How We Would Configure Our Ford Mustang Mach-E</h1>
      <h2>Surprisingly, we haven't opted for the quickest model.</h2>

      <p>Ford has just pulled the wraps off the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/mach-e">2021 Mustang Mach-E</a>. Deliveries of the Tesla-rivaling model from the Blue Oval won't begin until 2020 (with the GT model not coming until 2021) but Ford is already taking $500 reservation deposits, meaning you can place an order right now.</p>
      <p>To place a deposit, you have to first build your ideal Mach-E using the configurator tool. Five trim levels will be available including the Select, Premium, First Edition, California RT.1 Edition, and GT. We took a look at the various trim levels and here's how we would configure ours:</p>

      <p>While the $60,500 GT model will be the quickest of the bunch with 459 horsepower and 612 lb-ft of torque yielding a mid-three-second 0-60 mph time with the Performance Editon, we opted for a more affordable trim level. With 282 hp and a 0-60 mph time in the mid-six-second range, we thought the Extended Range Battery RWD would be sufficient.</p>
      <p>The Mach-E Premium trim starts at $50,600 but since we opted for the longest range battery, it adds $5,000 to the price for a 300-mile range. The Extended Range Battery AWD model is a bit more powerful with 332 hp and sub-five-second 0-60 time but it costs $2,700 more and only gives 270 miles of range. It is also worth noting the GT model tops out at 250 miles of range.</p>

      <p>There aren't many options to choose from on the Premium trim given it already includes a ton of standard features. These include 19-inch wheels, a hands-free liftgate, a glass roof, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, memory driver's seat, Active Park Assist, a 360-degree camera, and a B&amp;O 10-Speaker audio system. We added some Rapid Red paint for $400 and chose the Light Space Grey interior (a no-cost option), bringing the price up to <b>$56,000</b> exactly. With a $7,500 tax incentive, this price will drop below $50,000.</p>
      <p>If you can live without the heated elements, 19-inch wheels, and power liftgate, the equivalent California RT.1 Edition would be a bit cheaper at <b>$52,800</b>. We just preferred the styling of the Premium trim.</p>
