      <h1>Jeane Freeman confirms Glasgow super hospital inquiry will investigate dirty water linked to child's death</h1>
      <h2>The Health Secretary is set to make a statement on the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital scandal tomorrow.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:58:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:58</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Hutcheon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-hutcheon/</a></address>
      <p>Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has said a public inquiry into <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/you-couldnt-care-less-mum-20903503">Glasgow</a> ’s super hospital will investigate water contamination problems linked to the death of Milly Main.</p>
      <p>Freeman, who will also make a statement to Holyrood on the scandal, told <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/you-couldnt-care-less-mum-20903503">MSPs</a> she is “clear” the probe will examine the deadly infections at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/you-couldnt-care-less-mum-20903503">Queen Elizabeth University Hospital</a> (QEUH) campus.</p>
      <p>It came as figures showed the national performance against the accident and emergency waiting time target had fallen to its lowest level since March last year.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/you-couldnt-care-less-mum-20903503">Daily Record</a> revealed claims by a whistleblower last week that 26 child cancer patients contracted infections at the hospital in 2017.</p>

      <p>The insider alleged that one child, who we later revealed to be Milly, had died as a result of the bacteria.</p>
      <p>Milly's mum Kimberly Darroch told this newspaper she was “100%” sure water contamination at the hospital had caused Milly’s death.</p>
      <p>She called on NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to “stop lying” and urged Freeman to tell the truth about the case.</p>
      <p>Kimberly also revealed Milly, who had leukaemia, was in remission at the time she got the infection.</p>
      <p>An independent review is underway and a public inquiry will look at a raft of issues at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/you-couldnt-care-less-mum-20903503">QEUH</a> and the new Sick Kids hospital in Edinburgh, which remains unopened.</p>
      <p>Asked at the Health and Sport committee whether the review and the inquiry would examine water contamination, Freeman said:</p>
      <p>“It is my understanding the current independent review has taken evidence on that, and therefore that is part of what they are considering.”</p>
      <p>“I would expect that the public inquiry will also take that into account.”</p>
      <p>She added: “It’s clear that will be part of both pieces of work.”</p>
      <p>Freeman is also facing calls by Labour <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/you-couldnt-care-less-mum-20903503">MSP</a> Anas Sarwar, who was contacted by the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/you-couldnt-care-less-mum-20903503">whistleblower</a> over the the QEUH infection, to put NHSGGC into special measures.</p>
      <p>The Health Secretary has pointedly failed to rule out the move, which would mean the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/you-couldnt-care-less-mum-20903503">Government</a> effectively taking on a more hands-on approach with the organsation.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the Scottish Tories have been campaigning outside the new Sick Kids hospital, which Freeman stopped from opening in the summer over safety concerns.</p>
      <p>Conservative MSP Miles Briggs said: “Five years ago, Nicola Sturgeon was elected <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/you-couldnt-care-less-mum-20903503">First Minister</a> . Five years on, the Scottish NHS is lurching from crisis to crisis.”</p>
      <p>“Nothing symbolizes her government’s failures better than the new Sick Kids Hospital in Edinburgh: over-budget and still not delivered.”</p>
