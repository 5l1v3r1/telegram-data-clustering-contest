      <p>Martin Odegaard should be ready to face Real Madrid on Saturday. The Norwegian got injured against Levante, missed a couple of games and the international break with his ankle problem, but on Friday he stepped back onto the grass and trained by himself.</p>
      <p>The idea is that Odegaard works with the group today and tomorrow. The medics are optimistic he will face Real Madrid, but it depends on how he feels. The intention is to get him back for what is a special game for him, to play at the Santiago Bernabeu against his parent club.</p>
      <p>Odegaard is one of La Liga's sensations this seaosn. He's scored two and laid on three goals, one of the leaders of his team, who are surprisingly as high as fifth. He was the player of the month in September.</p>
      <p>The midfielder would love to show his quality to his parent club whom he hopes to star for one day.</p>
