      <h1>Stoltenberg: NATO won’t put weapons in space</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:56:01+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:56</time> by <a rel="author">Joshua Posaner, David M. Herszenhorn</a></address>
      <p>NATO will “remain defensive” in space as foreign ministers prepare to add it to the list of domains covered by the military alliance, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_170972.htm?selectedLocale=en">said Tuesday</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Brussels, Stoltenberg cautioned the alliance “has no intention to put weapons in space” but said: “We need to ensure our missions and operations have the right support.”</p>
      <p>He confirmed that ministers will on Wednesday designate space as NATO’s fifth domain alongside air, land, sea and cyber.</p>
      <p>The move comes amid increasing attention on the role of space in international security. Stoltenberg described it as necessary recognition of the opportunities and threats of space-based military assets, including satellites and other imaging and surveillance technology.</p>
      <p>Stoltenberg said around half of the estimated 2,000 satellites orbiting the Earth are owned by NATO countries. “So recognizing space as an operational domain will be a clear sign that we continue to strengthen our deterrence and defence in all areas,” he said.</p>
      <p>NATO foreign ministers meet Wednesday ahead of a meeting of heads of government in London starting December 3.</p>
      <p>The U.S. and France have both <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-wary-emmanuel-macron-space-force/">announced</a> plans to create new military structures focusing on space affairs, after India tested a satellite-downing missile earlier this year and the French government accused Russia of trying to snoop on its satellites.</p>
      <p>Germany has cautioned however that a multilateral approach is better than individual national efforts.</p>
      <p>“Space is essential to the alliance’s defence and deterrence, for early warning, communication and navigation,” Stoltenberg said today.</p>
