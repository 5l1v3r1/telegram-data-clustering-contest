      <p>Children and parents were left stunned at the lack of Christmas spirit after an eagle-eyed traffic warden gave the Stagecoach Santa bus a parking ticket in Exeter on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Eye-witnesses say the specially-decorated Christmas bus, which travels 'around the South West filled with giveaways and fun for all' according to their website, was parked by Exeter library when it fell foul of parking restrictions.</p>
      <p>Despite the bus acting as a grotto, plenty of excited kids and the driver - who was dressed as Gary the Rabbit - pleading his case, the traffic warden was unmoved and gave the ticket anyway.</p>
      <p>Witnesses report the warden even insisted that Gary remove his bunny head to issue the ticket to him directly.</p>
      <p>"He tried to explain that it's planned event but the parking officer kept saying that he's just doing his job," said witness Gosia Bartram.</p>
      <p>"I was there with my little boy.</p>
      <p>"The bus outside library was turned into a grotto. The driver is the one dressed as a bunny.</p>
      <p>"They also made the driver dressed as a bunny take the head off in front of the children."</p>

      <p>Devon County Council said no efforts had been made to contact them in advance of the event, and 'suitable parking arrangements could have been made' had they done so.</p>
      <p>A Devon County Council spokesperson said: “One of our parking enforcement officers issued a penalty charge notice (PCN) to a bus parked in an area of Rougemont Place, outside the library, where parking is not permitted.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, we hadn’t received notification of this event in advance, otherwise suitable parking arrangements could have been made for the vehicle.”</p>
      <p>The Stagecoach website confirms that the bus was scheduled to be in Exeter on Saturday for a 'High Street &amp; Castle Street Family Christmas Fair'.</p>
      <p>It is heading to Barnstaple Carnival on Thursday, November 28 and Children's Hospice South West on Thursday, December 12.</p>
      <p>The Santa Bus involves a Stagecoach driver dressing up as Santa 'to raise as much money as possible for a worthy cause'.</p>
      <p>The website continues: "The driver will be distributing goodwill and goodies to anyone that boards his specially decorated ‘Santa bus'."</p>
      <p>Stagecoach have been contacted for a comment on this story.</p>
