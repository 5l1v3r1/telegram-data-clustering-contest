      <p>Coronation Street legend Sally Lindsay was left cringing on the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> sofa with an unexpected throwback to the early 2000s and her attempt at <i>that</i> <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jennifer-aniston/">Jennifer Aniston</a> haircut.</p>
      <p>Back when everyone would head to the salon and get the ‘Rachel from Friends’, Sally spoke to Holly and Phil revealing that she didn’t think she pulled it off as well as she thought she did.</p>
      <p>In an unexpected throwback to her debut in 2001, Sally’s interview went off-kilter when she caught sight of a scene of her as Shelley Unwin arriving in the Rover’s pub for the first time.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Speaking about whether she’d return, Sally said: ‘Oh gosh. I mean, I’d never say never. I loved it! It’s brilliant – it still is brilliant…,’ but then got distracted by the clip being played.</p>
      <p>In the video, Shelley is seen running into the arms of Duggie Ferguson (John Bowe) in the clip in the era classic of a cream-coloured leather jacket, with her streaked hair poker straight with a side-parting.</p>
      <p>‘Oh good god! You never told me…that’s my first ever scene! That was my first ever seen with that blooming Jennifer…,’ she laughed.</p>
      <p>‘I thought I looked like Jennifer Aniston. I didn’t!’</p>
      <p>We thought it was a solid look, Sally!</p>

      <p>While Sally is definitely ‘never say never’ about returning to the Corrie cobbles, she was quick to shut down that she would be heading back anytime soon.</p>
      <p>Rumours of her return have been revealed to actually just be a 10-minute talking head for the show’s 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary documentary special.</p>
      <p>She explained: ‘It was mad actually. It was crazy. I’ve done like a 10-minute talking head, I think it’s called Queens of the Street as a working title?</p>

      <p>‘So it’s basically a load of us that have left and have sort of done quite well, we talked about our memories of the street and how it set our careers up, and all that.’</p>

      <p>‘We did this lovely little interview, didn’t think anything of it, and then next thing I know I’m going back to the Street! I said that was the first I’ve heard!’</p>
      <p>The star is now appearing on Channel 5 thriller, Cold Call – which focuses on a victim of identity fraud and her determination to find the person behind it.</p>
