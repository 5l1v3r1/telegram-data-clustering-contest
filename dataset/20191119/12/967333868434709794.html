        <b>American rapper Kanye West has been vocal in recent months about his conversion to Christianity, taking his ''Sunday services'' across the country since January, and releasing his latest album ''Jesus is King'' last month.</b>
      </p>
      <p>American rapper Kanye West has announced the forthcoming performance of his first opera, Nebuchadnezzar, directed by Vanessa Beecroft.</p>
      <p>West tweeted a picture of a gold foil opera programme engraved with the heading "A Kanye West Opera".</p>

      <p>​Tickets are on sale for the matinee performance at The Hollywood Bowl on 24 November.</p>
      <p>The contents of the opera have not yet been made public, yet many have suggested the biblical roots of the narrative sit well with the rapper superstar, known for espousing a very public relationship to God, ranging from his famous Sunday services to the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201911171077333738-kanye-west-says-he-is-no-longer-in-service-of-fame-and-money-but-in-service-to-god/">recent album Jesus is King.</a></p>
      <p>This is not the first time his story has been told in the operatic medium.</p>
      <p>1841's Nabucco (the Italian translation for Nebuchadnezzar) was an early work by composer Giuseppe Verdi, and was a passionate retelling of the story of a king gone mad.</p>
      <p>Small wonder that Twitter broke out in a flurry of response to the news, with excited fans agog over the new role their idol was taking on.</p>
