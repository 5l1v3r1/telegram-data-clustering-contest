      <p>Jane McDonald has admitted that she's never met Adele Roberts - despite her photo being her luxury item.</p>
      <p>I'm A Celeb viewers were left utterly baffled after discovering what the radio presenter had brought with her.</p>
      <p>Instead of having make-up, a pillow or a family photo as one of her luxury items, Adele chose a picture of her favourite Loose Women star.</p>
      <p>Speaking on This Morning today on the phone, Jane spoke about her shock over the moment.</p>

      <p>She told hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: "I'm absolutely gobsmacked. My phone started going ding, ding, ding!"</p>
      <p>Revealing that she had been at a hotel in Manchester at the time, she said: "I sat on the edge of my bed in my underwear [watching it]!"</p>
      <p>Asked whether she'd met her before, Jane said: "No I've never met her but I'd love to now."</p>

      <p>During a Bushtucker trial in last night's episode, the campmates tried to win the items for their peers.</p>
      <p>Everyone in the main camp's luxury item was boxed, while <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kate-garraway">Kate Garraway</a> , Adele Roberts, Roman Kemp and Myles Stephenson had to pass them down a line to each other using oars, and drop them into the box.</p>
      <p>They failed miserably and only managed to win Kate and Adele's items.</p>

      <p>They lost other campmates items including Miles' camera and James orthopedic cushion.</p>
      <p>But Adele got her luxury item, which was a framed photo of Loose Women's Jane McDonald.</p>
      <p>When she opened it up in the camp, her campmates were baffled as to why she chose that out of any luxury option, while Adele encouraged everyone to give the photo a "lucky rub".</p>

      <p>And they weren't the only ones who were confused.</p>
      <p>Viewers took to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to virtually eye-roll at Adele's gag.</p>
      <p>"Adele decided to have a framed pic of Jane McDonald as her luxury item because she thought it’d make her the hilarious ledge of the series.... cringe", said one.</p>

      <p>"Imagine when james is told that he didn’t get his special neck cushion but Adele got a photo of Jane McDonald????", ranted another.</p>
      <p>"Can you imagine being in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> and not everyone wins their luxury item and you hope the people who did will share theirs or even be useful to camp in some way..</p>
      <p>"Then Adele opens hers and it’s a photo of Jane McDonald.. ABSOLUTELY POINTLESS", said another.</p>
