      <h3>VICE President Leni Robredo’s co-chairmanship of the Inter-agency Council on Anti-Illegal Drugs does not carry with it a Cabinet rank, presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo has clarified.</h3>
      <p>Panelo made the remark after her co-chair in the ICAD, Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency director general Aaron Aquino, balked at giving her a copy of the list of high value targets in the campaign against illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>Philippine National Police officer in charge Police General Archie Gamboa said the PNP would follow the PDEA’s lead on the matter.</p>
      <p>“The post she was appointed to is not a Cabinet level. The discretion to appoint her as a member of the Cabinet, in addition to her appointment as the anti-illegal drug czar, lies with the President,” Panelo said in a statement.</p>
      <p>In an earlier interview, Panelo said Robredo’s appointment to the ICAD carried with it a Cabinet rank.</p>
      <p>“It is! It is a Cabinet rank. In other words, she will be joining us at the Cabinet and she’s welcome,” Panelo said.</p>
      <p>President Rodrigo Duterte himself indicated that Robredo needed to be a Cabinet official if she would lead the anti-drug campaign.</p>
      <p>“If I would take her in as the drug czar, I will have to first make her a Cabinet member. Then I will give her the marching orders and the specific functions. All in connection with drugs, kanya,” Duterte said.</p>
      <p>“I will swear her in as a Cabinet member. First, balik siya so that she will have the authority,” he added.</p>
      <p>However yesterday Malacanang said the President would no longer appoint Robredo to his Cabinet due to the latter’s supposed “missteps” during her first two weeks as drug czar.</p>
      <p>Duterte frowned on Robredo’s consultations with organizations and people critical of the government’s war on drugs, her request for unlimited access to information on the drug war, and her “tendency” to share confidential information, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said.</p>
      <p>The supposed blunders made Duterte change his mind about making Robredo a member of his Cabinet, Panelo said.</p>
