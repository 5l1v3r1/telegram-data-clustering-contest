      <p><b>Amaravati (Andhra Pradesh):</b> Andhra Pradesh has become the second state after Kerala in the country to try a humanoid cop with the induction of Ms Cybira (a cyber security interactive robotic agent) in the Visakhapatnam police commissionerate. <br/><br/>The robot will chase the cops to deliver. If they fail to attend to the complaints from aggrieved persons within the stipulated period, it will pass on the information to the higher ups, upto the commissioner’s level. <br/><br/>Ms Cybira began functioning on trial basis in the Maharanipet police station in the port city. On the first day, the robot received a complaint from a person seeking recovery of Rs 50,000 bad debt. However, the police found the complaint not tenable because of its civil nature.</p>

      <p>City police commissioner RK Meena inaugurated Ms Cybira. He said the humanoid cop would receive complaints in writing or through oral statement. It will reduce the oral complaints to writing and forwards it to the investigation officer (IO). It waits for 24 hours before sending a reminder. The cops will get another 24 hours after reminder and later it will forward the matter to the next level higher officer. For now, it can forward the complaint till the police commissioner. Robotcoupler, a startup company that developed the robot cop for Vizag, says the complainant will get an acknowledgement through WhatsApp. The follow up action will also be communicated through WhatsApp. <br/><br/>“There is no human interface in receiving complaints. And, complainants don’t need to come with a written complaint. There are timelines for each stage to attend to the complaint. We are hopeful of good results when we evaluate its functioning after a few days”, said Maharanipet sub-inspector Pilla Ramesh, who is currently in charge of Cybira. <br/><br/><br/>Kerala had introduced the humanoid cop in February.</p>
