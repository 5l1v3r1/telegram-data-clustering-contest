      <p>Your handset’s <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/status-bar/">Status Bar</a> displays pertinent information about current events, including the time, battery percentage, internet connection source, VPN connection, and even the date if you happen to be using using an iPad. But it also displays various icons and indicators depending on what your device is doing, such as location usage, personal hotspot usage, web loading activity, and more.</p>
      <p>Those who’d like a greater command over what appears in the Status Bar may want to try using a <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/jailbreak-apps-tweaks/">jailbreak tweak</a> called <b>HideStatusBarItemsPro</b> by iOS developer <i>Chashmeet Singh</i>. Just as the name denotes, this add-on lets users choose what does and doesn’t appear in their pwned handset’s Status Bar.</p>
      <p>Upon installing HideStatusBarItemsPro, users will find a new dedicated preference pane in the Settings app where they can choose what appears (and doesn’t appear) in their Status Bar on the Lock screen and throughout the rest of the operating system independently:</p>

      <p>The items that can be hidden from the Status Bar with HideStatusBarItemsPro include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The time</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/do-not-disturb/">Do Not Disturb</a> icon</li>
        <li>Airplane Mode icon</li>
        <li>Signal strength</li>
        <li>Carrier text</li>
        <li>Wi-Fi icon</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/battery/">Battery</a> level</li>
        <li>Battery percentage</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/Bluetooth/">Bluetooth</a> icon</li>
        <li>Alarm icon</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/location/">Location</a> icon</li>
        <li>Orientation Lock icon</li>
        <li>Screen mirroring icon</li>
        <li>VPN icon</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The tweak can also be enabled or disabled on demand in its entirety, and the developer includes an Apply Changes button at the bottom of the preference pane to help users save their changes after making them.</p>
      <p>If you’re a minimalist and you’d prefer to see as little in the Status Bar as possible, then you’d probably like what HideStatusBarItemsPro brings to the table. On the other hand, many of these icons are displayed for a reason, and hiding them could result in forgetting about what’s happening in the background, such as being connected to a <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/vpn/">VPN</a>, leaving your device in Do Not Disturb Mode, or being unable to discern your current battery level at a glance.</p>
      <p>If you’re interested in trying HideStatusBarItemsPro, then you can <a href="https://repo.packix.com/package/com.chashmeet.hidestatusbaritemspro">purchase the tweak for $1.00 from the Packix repository</a> in your package manager of choice. The tweak is validated to work with all <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/jailbreak/">jailbroken</a> iOS 11 devices, and may also work on newer versions.</p>
