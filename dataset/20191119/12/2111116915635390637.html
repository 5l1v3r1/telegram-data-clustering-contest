      <p>Tile has brought three of its popular<a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/news/these-new-tile-trackers-mean-theres-even-less-excuse-for-losing-your-keys"> Bluetooth location trackers</a> to India, adding more price and range options to its portfolio with the Sticker, Slim, and Pro.</p>
      <p>Tile is one of the most prominent players in the tracker space and comes with a big community of users that create a network of object tracking in case of emergencies. In India, Tile products are distributed by Brand Eyes, which also handles Skullcandy.</p>

      <p>The three products primarily work in the same way. You attach the Tile tracker to any object, and it stays connected to your phone via <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/news/these-new-tile-trackers-mean-theres-even-less-excuse-for-losing-your-keys">the Tile app</a>. If it is in range, you can tap the ‘Find’ button to get your tracker to ring. Similarly, the button on the tracker can be double pressed to get your phone to ring, even if it is on silent. If you happen to leave your belongings behind and out of range, the last known location will be shown on the map. If that’s not enough, you can use the ‘community find’ option in the app, where every phone running the Tile app can help locate yours.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/news/tiles-new-sticky-bluetooth-tracker-will-help-you-find-just-about-anything">Tile sticker</a> is a small button-shaped tracker, which is its smallest tracker to date.

      <p>The Tile Pro is a slightly bigger, keychain-like tracker, and is the highest performance tracker from the company.
