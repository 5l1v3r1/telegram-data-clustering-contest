      <h2>Large concrete and metal barriers have been erected and pedestrianised areas blocked off in UK cities to prevent vehicles driving into crowds of festive revellers</h2>

      <p>Sobering images show the "rings of steel" protecting Britain's Christmas markets this year as security is bolstered - despite the downgrading of the terror threat level. <br/><br/>Large concrete and metal barriers have been erected and pedestrianised areas blocked off in UK cities to prevent vehicles driving into crowds of festive revellers.</p>
      <p>Heavy police presences could be seen in Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh with cops patrolling the perimeters of Christmas attractions which opened last week.</p>
      <p>Visitors to the popular markets are penned in by heavy-duty blockades, built to stop vehicle-ramming attacks like the ones that rocked Berlin and London in 2016 and 2017.</p>
      <p>The extra fortified measures come even after the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre - part of MI5 - lowered the UK terror treat level from "severe" to "substantial" for the first time in five years.</p>

      <p>It means a terrorist attack is now "likely" rather than "highly likely".</p>
      <p>In Birmingham, police could be seen mingling with revellers enjoying bratwurst, mince pies and mulled wine at the Frankfurt Christmas Market which is celebrating 20 years in the city.</p>
      <p>West Midlands Police said officers would be working closely with market staff and stall holders to hold daily briefings as well as monitoring public transport. <br/><br/>Superintendent Jack Hadley said: "As always, we can't wait to welcome the Frankfurt Christmas Market and the millions of visitors it attracts each year.</p>
      <p>"I want to reassure the public that my officers will be in and around the market keeping the public safe and will also be on hand to help anybody who has any concerns.</p>

      <p>"Throughout the year armed officers are stationed in the city centre on standby and ready to respond to an incident. This will be no different over the 2019 festive period.</p>
      <p>"With such a vast amount of people visiting the market, we would encourage people to remain alert and to tuck away personal belongings.</p>
      <p>"I want everyone who comes to visit to have a good time so I would encourage people to stay safe and enjoy."</p>

      <p>Police Scotland said there would be increased patrols around Edinburgh's busy European Christmas Market, which drew a million visitors last year.</p>
      <p>Inspector David Brady, from the City Centre Policing Team, said: “Edinburgh is undoubtedly one of the best cities in the world to celebrate Christmas and New Year in and Operation Winter City helps us keep the capital a wonderful place to stay in, as well as to visit during the festive period.</p>

      <p>“We will have increased high-visibility patrols throughout the city and these officers will be on hand to provide the public with any assistance they require, while also looking out for any matters that require police attention.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Our dedicated resources will be doing everything they can to keep the public safe, but our communities have a vital role to play in helping with this."</p>
      <p>In 2016, an IS fanatic killed 12 when he ploughed a lorry through Berlin's Breitscheidplatz.</p>
