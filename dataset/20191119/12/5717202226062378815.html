        <b>A number of West Ham United fans have taken to Twitter to comment on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/west-ham-monitor-rafa-benitez-20910081">reports from the Daily Mirror suggesting</a> that the Hammers could target Rafa Benitez.</b>

      <p>Manuel Pellegrini looks to have plenty of work to do after the international break. The Irons will have gone more than two months without a win by the time they face Tottenham Hotspur this weekend.</p>

      <p>They sit just two places above the relegation zone. And it appears that the West Ham fans are making plans in case they do decide to replace the Chilean in the near future.</p>

      <p>The Mirror notes that Benitez would be interested in speaking to West Ham if an opportunity did come up in the near future. He has spent the last few months in China with Dalian Yifang.</p>
      <p>There has been something of a mixed response to the reports from the West Ham fans. It has been suggested that the board are a bigger problem than Pellegrini and thus, Benitez is likely to also struggle.</p>
