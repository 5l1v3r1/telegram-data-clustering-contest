      <p>Zürich-based Swiss Infrastructure and Exchange (SIX) Group AG, the operator of Switzerland’s stock exchange, recently revealed that it has made an all-cash offer for Bolsas y Mercados Espanoles, a Spanish stock exchange operator.</p>
      <p>The deal would <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-18/six-group-offers-to-buy-spanish-exchange-bme-for-3-1-billion">reportedly</a> establish the third-largest financial market infrastructure group in Europe.</p>
      <p>SIX is an established exchange seeking to incorporate blockchain technology. SIX plans a <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/09/151927-switzerlands-six-exchange-delays-launch-of-digital-asset-platform-until-late-2020/">digital asset exchange for some time in 2o20.</a></p>
      <p>The SIX Group, which is privately held by a select group of Switzerland’s financial institutions, will be offering €34 per share for 100% of BME, according to the company’s management. This would value the firm at around €2.8 billion (appr. $3.1 billion). Notably, the offer was made shortly after Euronext NV (a giant European stock exchange with offices in Amsterdam, Brussels, London, and Lisbon) revealed it was holding discussions with BME regarding a potential combination.</p>
      <p>SIX chairman Romeo Lacher stated:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“This is in line with SIX’s growth strategy and our commitment to serve customers with highly reliable infrastructure services and seamless access to capital markets.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The offer made is 33.9% higher than the closing price of BME’s shares on November 15, 2019. SIX’s management says it intends to keep BME’s stand-alone listing in the Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia Stock Exchanges.</p>
      <p>SIX Group has reportedly been considering a potential acquisition of an EU-based bourse, according to sources familiar with the matter. BME and the Austrian Wiener Boerse AG are potential targets.</p>
      <p>Euronext’s management has confirmed in a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/18/1948376/0/en/Euronext-s-Statement-Regarding-Recent-Press-Speculation.html">press release </a>that it is now holding discussions with the Board of Directors of BME, which “may or may not lead to an offer being made.”</p>
      <p>Euronext says that a “further announcement will be made as and when appropriate.”</p>
