      <p>Eighteen years after their last hit, <a href="https://www.spin.com/tag/smash-mouth">Smash Mouth</a> are still a reliably insane presence on Twitter and the internet at large: hovering over an entire <a href="https://www.spin.com/2017/04/you-must-listen-to-this-cover-of-everyones-favorite-90s-hit-made-entirely-out-of-samples-of-bill-oreillys-voice/">generation</a> of <a href="https://www.spin.com/2017/03/the-chainsmokers-smash-mouth-all-star-closer/">memes</a>, feuding with <a href="https://www.spin.com/2016/10/smash-mouth-oakland-athletics-twitter-fight/">baseball teams</a>, <a href="https://www.spin.com/2018/02/smash-mouth-car-seat-headrest-something-soon/">covering</a> and <a href="https://www.spin.com/2018/02/car-seat-headrest-fallen-horses-smash-mouth-cover/">getting covered by</a> hip young bands, offhandedly revealing the alternate history <a href="https://www.spin.com/2017/02/original-handwritten-lyrics-show-smash-mouths-all-star-was-almost-a-much-darker-song/">of their most famous song</a>, and dispensing opinions about <a href="https://www.spin.com/2018/05/smash-mouth-dj-khaled-oral-sex/">DJ Khaled’s aversion to oral sex</a>. They’re back at it today, announcing to their followers that they stand proudly with the Lil Pumps, Lil Xans, and Juice WRLDs of the world.</p>
      <p>Smash Mouth’s declaration of allegiance to pharmaceutical-assisted sing-rap by depressed teenagers came in response to a tweet from <i>The Source</i> magazine reading, “Hey… just wondering If anyone knows when rappers will start actually rapping again.”</p>
      <p>Smash Mouth responded thusly:</p>

      <p>Parents, old heads, Gen-X hip-hop mags: Respect the movement, and don’t find yourself on the wrong side of history. You heard it straight from the “All Star” guys: The arc of the moral universe bends toward Xanax and auto-tune.</p>
