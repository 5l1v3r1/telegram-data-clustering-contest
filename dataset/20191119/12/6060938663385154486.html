      <p>Rajeshwari shot a score of 118 out of 125 in qualifications on the way to winning silver in the event. She shot rounds of 24 23 24 24 and 23 to top the 69-strong field.</p>

      <p>Rajeshwari expressed happiness at achieving the feat.</p>
      <p>"Although I missed out on the gold, I am still very proud to hold the national record. Some really classy names I climbed up over. This is something my father also held at a point and I am elated at being able to emulate the person I so look up to," Rajeshwari said.</p>
      <p>Seema, Shreyasi and Manisha all shot 116 in 2018.</p>
