      <p>Mel B has shared her porn preferences, citing lesbian scenes as being ‘kinder’ in the grand scheme of things.</p>
      <p>Hey, whatever floats your boat, Mel…so to speak.</p>
      <p>The Spice Girls star has revealed she’s had relationships with both men and women, but seems when it comes to her theatrical proclivities it’s all about the ladies.</p>
      <p>In the world of adult entertainment, you see, she prefers to watch something ‘more sensual’, and when there is momentous chatter about sexism in heterosexual porn she sort of has a point.</p>
      <p>Speaking on podcast The Truth Flirts – which she hosts in partnership with dating app Badoo – Scary Spice said: ‘Lesbian porn is more sensual, I think anyway. It’s nicer and kinder.’</p>
      <p>She’s not alone – a few years ago <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/07/27/why-are-so-many-women-choosing-lesbian-and-gay-porn-over-heterosexual-porn-6033183/">we asked a whole bunch of you why you prefer lesbian porn</a> after a PornHub and Buzzfeed study found it the most popular genre for women.</p>

      <p>Mel – who has three daughters from previous relationships – also discussed the differences between men and women when it comes to dating, and admitted her time with former flame Christine Crokos was ‘really beautiful’ with hardly any arguments.</p>

      <p>She added: ‘I do think that dating women is very different to dating men…</p>
      <p>‘I had a five-year relationship with a woman and it was an intense five years but it was actually a really beautiful five years.</p>
      <p>‘We barely kind of argued, because we both thought the same, wanted the same out of life. It was really interesting when I actually compare it to my other relationships.’</p>
      <p>The star may be more than ok with voicing her views on the podcast, but outspoken Mel previously admitted she found it a little ‘cringey’ talking to her daughter Phoenix, 18, about the birds and the bees.</p>
      <p>‘When Phoenix was about 16, I was like, we need to sit down and have a word about safe sex and contraception, and she was like “what?”’ Mel said.</p>
      <p>‘And I think all her other friends had never even had that conversation with their mothers. I’m so glad, as cringey as it was, I was very to the point, I told her about boys’ intentions, or the main intentions of boys at that age.</p>
      <p>‘We spoke about contraception thoroughly, about condoms, what happens when you don’t use a condom, which I think terrified her to her core.’</p>
