      <h1>Batu Kawan 4Q net profit up 25%, ends FY19 on a flat note</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 19): Batu Kawan Bhd, which counts Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd as a main subsidiary, saw its net profit for the fourth quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (4QFY19) rise 25% to RM96.70 million from RM77.25 million a year ago, lifted by its manufacturing segment, higher other operating income, better share of results from associates, and lower income tax expenses.</p>
      <p>Consequently, earnings per share grew to 24.38 sen from 19.25 sen last year, Batu Kawan's stock exchange filing showed today, despite revenue falling 9% to RM3.92 billion from RM4.32 billion.</p>
      <p>Its manufacturing segment reported a 64% jump in profit to RM108.37 million from RM65.94 million, despite a 16% drop in revenue to RM2.15 billion from RM2.55 billion. Its plantation segment, however, saw profit sink 24% to RM133.41 million from RM176.37 million, though revenue grew 2% to RM1.69 billion from RM1.65 billion, no thanks to lower crude palm oil and palm kernel prices.</p>
      <p>The group, which had warned in August that it could see reduced profit in FY19, following a dismal 3QFY19, closed the year with earnings little changed from a year ago. Net profit came in at RM363.50 million versus RM365.68 million previously, though revenue dropped 15% to RM16.05 billion from RM18.95 billion.</p>
      <p>On prospect, the group said today that it expects a higher profit for the financial year ending Sept 30, 2020 (FY20), as its plantation segment is expected to improve with the recovery of CPO and PK prices.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the performance of the group’s oleochemical division should be sustained with some additional capacities coming onstream. "As for the group’s industrial chemical division, profits from both chlor-alkali and sulphuric acid businesses are projected to be satisfactory," it added.</p>
      <p>Batu Kawan shares slipped two sen to RM15.40 today, bringing a market capitalisation of RM6.04 billion. The counter saw some 15,200 shares transacted. Year-to-date, its share price has retreated some 8% from RM16.68.</p>
