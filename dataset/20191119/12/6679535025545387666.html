      <p>Reality TV star and make-up mogul Kylie Jenner will sell the majority of her cosmetics company for $600 million.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old’s brand, including Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin, will be controlled by beauty giant Coty, reports <i>bbc.com.</i></p>
      <p>Kylie says she is building the brand into an “international beauty powerhouse”.</p>
      <p>Forbes reported that she made $360 million in sales in 2018, making her the youngest self-made billionaire ever.</p>
      <p>The chairman of Coty’s board called Kylie a “modern-day icon, with an incredible sense of the beauty consumer”.</p>
      <p>Her online influence is so powerful that she reduced Snapchat’s stock market value by $1.3bn when she tweeted that she does not use the app anymore.</p>
      <p>She launched her brand in 2015 with a line of lipsticks, and has since then branched out into face make-up and skincare.</p>
      <p>Kylie is the highest earner in the Kardashian family.</p>
      <p>She faced backlash after being named a “self-made” billionaire, but defended herself saying that none of her money has come from inheritance.</p>
      <p>She has more than 151 million followers on her personal Instagram account, as well as 22 million on her Kylie cosmetics account.</p>
      <p>Coty, which owns brands like Burberry and Hugo Boss, will have a 51% stake in the company.</p>
      <p>It said the deal will be completed in 2020.</p>
