      <h3>Menu bar layout</h3>
      <p>Your Mac menu bar is set up for quick access to your system settings, app menus, and status indicators; from left to right.</p>
      <h4>Apple menu</h4>
      <p>The Apple icon sits furthest to the left on your menu bar and remains there regardless of the apps you have open. Whenever you want to get information about your Mac, open the System Preferences, log out, or shut down your Mac, just click that Apple icon.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>App menu</h4>
      <p>To the right of the Apple menu, you have your app menu. When you have an app open and currently active, you will see its menu options here. It begins with the app’s name in bold on the left and all options for that app to the right.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Status indicators</h4>
      <p>Over to the right side of the menu bar, you’ll see your status indicators. This can include volume control, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, battery level, and the date and time. These types of items can be added, removed, and rearranged to suit your preference.</p>
      <h4>Search, Siri, and Notification Center</h4>
      <p>After the status indicators, you’ll see buttons for Spotlight Search, Siri, and the Notification Center. These are convenient tools for daily use and the buttons in your menu bar make it easy to access each of three with a click.</p>

      <h3>Adding icons and buttons</h3>
      <p>Controls built into your Mac such as the time, date, volume, and Wi-Fi can be added to the menu bar from their settings in <b>Apple icon</b> &gt; <b>System Preferences</b>.</p>
      <p>Here are few examples of system controls to get you started:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Date and time: <b>System Preferences </b>&gt;<b> Date and Time </b>&gt; enable<b> Show date and time in menu bar</b>.</li>
        <li>Battery: <b>System Preferences </b>&gt;<b> Energy Saver </b>&gt; enable<b> Show battery status in menu bar</b>.</li>
        <li>Volume: <b>System Preferences </b>&gt;<b> Sound </b>&gt; enable<b> Show volume in menu bar</b>.</li>
        <li>Wi-Fi:<b> System Preferences </b>&gt;<b> Network </b>&gt; enable<b> Show Wi-Fi status in menu bar</b>.</li>
        <li>Bluetooth: <b>System Preferences </b>&gt;<b> Bluetooth </b>&gt; enable<b> Show Bluetooth in menu bar</b>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Many apps that you download from the App Store will offer this as well. Depending on the app, access the settings and look for the menu bar option.</p>

      <h3>Removing and rearranging icons</h3>
      <p>You can remove icons from the right side of the menu bar if you like. For instance, you might <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/10/10/remove-siri-shortcut-mac-menu-bar-dock/">never use the Siri button</a> and want to free up that space for something different.</p>
      <p>You can use the steps above to disable the “Show in menu bar” option for the particular control.</p>
      <p>For an alternative way to quickly remove an icon from the menu bar, hold down your <b>Command</b> key, click the icon, drag it out of the menu bar, and release.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In addition to adding and removing icons, you can rearrange them how you want them. As an example, you may prefer to have your clock on the other side of your volume control.</p>
      <p>To rearrange an icon, hold your <b>Command</b> key, click the icon, drag it to its new spot, and release.</p>
