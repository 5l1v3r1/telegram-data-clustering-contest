      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | Robbie Williams got into conversation with a claret and blue fan and has been talking Dean Smith's side, the defeat at Wolves and more</h2>

      <p>Robbie Williams is a die-hard Port Vale fan - but he knows a thing or two about Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>That much was evident when he was filmed thanking a hotel owner who once looked after him in <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/sutton-coldfield">Sutton Coldfield</a> during his Take That days.</p>
      <p>The popstar was touring with the group before going solo and was staying at a hotel run by the person on the other end of the phone.</p>
      <p>They recounted going to the pub to watch the football and going our for something to eat.</p>
      <p>Williams took a real interest in how <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smit</a>'s side were getting on, once he found out the person on the other end of the line was indeed a fan of the claret and blue.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Robbie was obviously keen on how the Villa are doing in their first season back in the Premier League, asking if they 'were doing good', whether they would be able to keep hold of captain Jack Grealish and how striker <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wesley-moraes">Wesley</a> is getting on.</p>
      <p>And he asked - daringly - how they have reacted to Sunday's defeat to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>.</p>
      <p>After a back-and-forth about how each other's sides were doing, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/robbie-williams">Williams</a> signed off with an 'Up The Villa' before the video call ended.</p>
