      <h1>Star Wars: Isaac, Boyega Requested Character Changes for Rise of Skywalker</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:11:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:11</time> by <a rel="author">Narayan Liu</a></address>
      <p>In just a number of weeks, the expansive "Skywalker Saga" will end when <a href="http://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</a> hits theaters. There is always the possibility that newer characters such as Rey, Finn and Poe will appear in other areas of the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise, but it is unlikely that we will see them on the big screen again, at least not in the near future.</p>
      <p>That alone means the upcoming film is -- in many ways -- the last chance the franchise has to flesh out these characters and establish who they really are. Actors Oscar Isaac and John Boyega, who play Poe Dameron and Finn, respectively, recently revealed how they shaped their characters in <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>, stating that they had requested specific changes to their characters.</p>

      <p>Isaac wanted Poe to get "out of the cockpit and into the group," while Boyega hoped that Finn would get a chance to prove that he was more than just a "comedic goofy dude who never gets stuff done." Boyega added, "I definitely wanted more after <i>Episode VIII.</i>" The actors then revealed that director J.J Abrams essentially granted both of their wishes. Boyega stated, "[<i>Rise of Skywalker</i>] makes Finn's <i>Episode VIII</i> arc make more sense. We got to bring out a side of Finn we haven't seen."</p>
      <p>The last we saw of both characters, Finn, Poe and the rest of the Resistance had fled the First Order on Crait, thanks in part to Rey, who finally reunited with the group. Marketing for <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> has revealed very little about the respective journeys of the former Stormtrooper and the Resistance pilot, it can only be assumed that they will be instrumental in defeating the forces of the First Order.</p>
      <p>Directed and co-written by J.J. Abrams, <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyongâ€™o, Domhnall Gleeson, Kelly Marie Tran, Joonas Suotamo, Billie Lourd, Keri Russell, Anthony Daniels, Mark Hamill, Billy Dee Williams and Carrie Fisher, with Naomi Ackie and Richard E. Grant. The film arrives Dec. 20.</p>
