      <p>A sentencing hearing is underway in New Westminster Tuesday for an Oliver man who murdered a Belgian tourist in August 2018.</p>
      <p>Despite initially being <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/236729/oliver-man-murder-charge">charged with first-degree murder</a>, 27-year-old Sean McKenzie <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/266734/guilty-plea-in-tourist-murder">pleaded guilty</a> to the second-degree murder of 28-year-old Amelie Sakkalis, who had been hitchhiking across B.C.</p>
      <p>Sakkalis' body was found near Highway 1 north of Boston Bar on Aug. 22, 2018. McKenzie was found nearby and was immediately arrested.</p>
      <p>The court heard Tuesday that McKenzie sexually assaulted Sakkalis and stabbed her repeatedly, as reported by <a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/live-coverage-sentencing-hearing-for-man-who-pleaded-guilty-in-killing-of-belgian-tourist-1.4692359">CTV News</a>. The Crown called the attack “exceptionally brutal” and “unprovoked.”</p>
      <p>McKenzie has no prior criminal record, and his family say they are stunned by the murder. McKenzie's lawyer said McKenzie “has no answer” for why he committed the murder.</p>
      <p>Sentencing submissions wrapped up Tuesday morning, and a decision is expected to be delivered at 3 p.m.</p>
      <p>Second-degree murder carries an automatic life sentence with no chance of parole for at least 10 to 25 years. The Crown is seeking at least 23 years before McKenzie is eligible for parole.</p>
