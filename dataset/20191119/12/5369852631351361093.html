      <p>IRELAND’S 1-1 DRAW <a href="https://www.the42.ie/denmark-ireland-4896306-Nov2019/">with Denmark on Monday night</a> confirmed they will finish third in the group, with the Danes and the Swiss qualifying automatically for Euro 2020. </p>
      <p>But the Boys in Green could yet qualify via the Nations League play-offs.</p>
      <p>Exactly who Ireland play next is unconfirmed. The team’s pathway, however, will become clearer following the outcome of Tuesday night’s Group E clash between Wales and Hungary in Cardiff, with the Slovakia-Azerbaijan game in the same group also potentially significant.</p>
      <p>Ireland are one of five teams from Nations League B not to have qualified already. The others are: Wales, Northern Ireland, Slovakia and Bosnia.</p>
      <p>Of those teams, Ireland, Northern Ireland and Bosnia are all guaranteed a qualifying spot, while Wales and Slovakia may still qualify directly or at worst enter the play-offs.</p>
      <p>A win for them on Tuesday would see Wales qualify, though a draw would open the way for Slovakia who will go through pending that outcome along with a victory for them over Azerbaijan. Hungary, meanwhile, will also qualify if they win regardless of what the Slovaks do.</p>
      <p>All of which means Ireland are set to come up against either Wales, Bosnia or Slovakia in the semis. With all three teams having a higher ranking than the Irish side, it means the Boys in Green will have to travel away for their one-off semi-final.</p>
      <p>Bosnia, meanwhile, as the best-ranked League B team look likely to face a home match against the worst-ranked side, Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy’s side could then potentially play a final with Northern Ireland or Bosnia should they get over the first obstacle.</p>
      <p>So, to clarify, there are a couple of potential outcomes…</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wales beat Hungary; Ireland play Slovakia.</li>
        <li>Wales draw with Hungary and Slovakia beat Azerbaijan to qualify; Ireland play Wales.</li>
        <li>Wales lose to Hungary or Wales draw and Slovakia fail to beat Azerbaijan; Ireland could play Bosnia, Slovakia or Wales depending on how the draw pans out.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If Ireland get past the semi-final, Friday’s draw in Nyon will determine whether their prospective final is either home or away.</p>
      <p>The semi-finals of the play-offs will be on 26 March, while the final is set for 31 March.</p>
