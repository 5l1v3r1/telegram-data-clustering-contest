      <p>Following the release of new <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/lil-peep/">Lil Peep</a> documentary and album Everybody’s Everything, which premiered on November 11, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/machine-gun-kelly/">Machine Gun Kelly</a> has unveiled an acoustic cover in tribute to the star.</p>
      <p>MGK posted a clip of himself performing Peep’s acoustic walk away as the door slams, along with the lyric caption, ‘<i>I just wanted to help / Now I’m goin’ to hell / Walk away as the door slams</i>,’ in honour of the late emo rapper – real name Gustav Elijah Åhr.</p>
      <p>It’s not the first Peep reference Machine Gun Kelly has released lately, with his recent Glass House single featuring the lyrics: ‘<i>Wish Lil Peep and me had spoke, but I can’t get that back / Just came from Pittsburgh, damn, I’ll miss my homie Mac / </i><i>Yeah, last time I got off the stage, I looked <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/linkin-park/">Chester</a> in the face</i>.’</p>

      <p>If you haven’t yet seen Everybody’s Everything, watch the trailer below to get a feel of the feature-length documentary.</p>
      <p>Its full description reads: “Creating a unique mix of punk, emo and trap, Lil Peep was set to bring a new musical genre to the mainstream when he died of a drug overdose at just 21 years old. From the streets of Los Angeles to studios in London and sold out tours in Russia, the artist born Gustav Ahr touched countless lives through his words, his sound and his very being.</p>
      <p>“Executive produced by Terrence Malick, Everybody’s Everything is an intimate, humanistic portrait that seeks to understand an artist who attempted to be all things to all people.”</p>
