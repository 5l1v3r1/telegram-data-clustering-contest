      <p>ATLANTA -- Burger King is being grilled for the way it cooks its burgers.</p>
      <p>A vegan man is suing the fast-food restaurant after eating its new Impossible Whopper.</p>
      <p>Philip Williams of Atlanta says that he filed the lawsuit on behalf of other vegans.</p>
      <p>He says it's impossible to claim the burger is "zero percent beef" when it's cooked on the same grill as beef burgers.</p>
      <p>He also says Burger King does not disclose its cooking practices.</p>
      <p>The restaurant's online menu says guests looking for a meat-free option can request a different cooking method.</p>
      <p>Burger King told media outlets it does not comment on pending litigation.</p>
