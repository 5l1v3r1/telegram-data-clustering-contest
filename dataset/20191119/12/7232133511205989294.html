      <h1>Wyckoff Study Suggests Bitcoin Bottom In, Price Could Pass $14,000</h1>

      <p>For the umpteenth day in a row, Bitcoin (BTC) has bled out. In fact, as reported by NewsBTC on Monday, the cryptocurrency fell as low as $8,000 last trading session, plunging by 5% as bulls failed to step in while bears asserted their dominance.</p>
      <p>This bearish price action, which has been going on for months now — save for a few moments of reprieve — has made many wonder at which point Bitcoin will bottom. According to a popular crypto trader’s interpretation of a technical study by legendary chartist Richard Wyckoff, the bottom came in at $7,300.</p>

      <h3>Is the Bitcoin Bottom In?</h3>
      <p>Trader Coiner Yadox<a href="https://twitter.com/Yodaskk/status/1196399730378641408"> recently noted</a> that Bitcoin’s price action from the long-term bottom of $3,150 established in December of 2018 until now looks much like a textbook Richard Wyckoff pattern, which is marked by a strong surge upward after a bear market, a double-top pattern, an accumulation throwback, and then a bullish continuation after a bullish breakout.</p>
      <p>Yadox suggested that should his interpretation of this Wyckoff pattern be correct, Bitcoin found a medium-term bottom at $7,400, and will soon see a strong breakout to the upside.</p>

      <p>It isn’t only Wyckoff studies that support the idea of a Bitcoin bottom being in. Per <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/03/research-firm-bitcoin-price-bottomed-7300-recovery-possible/">previous reports from NewsBTC</a>, cryptocurrency-centric research boutique Delphi Digital noted that Bitcoin’s volume profile, the amount of cryptocurrency that was traded, has printed clear signs that a bottom is in. More specifically, the market printed signs of weak volume (capitulation), a short accumulation at the bottoming range, then a surge out of accumulation into a potentially new bull phase.</p>
      <p>They added that they currently see the cryptocurrency market very tied to risk assets, like the S&amp;P 500. With risk assets setting new all-time highs on Friday after a strong jobs report and a potential trade deal, it could be said that BTC will <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/08/gold-plummets-u-s-stock-market-sees-record-high-will-bitcoin-follow/">surge higher with the risk assets.</a></p>

      <h3>Not So Fast</h3>
      <p>While Bitcoin’s price action over the past few months looks near identical to Wyckoff’s studies, there is one indicator of utmost importance that suggests Yadox’s hopium is misguided.</p>
      <p>The indicator in question is the Hash Ribbons. The ribbons, which track the health and sentiment of Bitcoin miners, show that miners <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/19/bitcoin-price-edge-cliff-redux-2018-capitulation/">are on the verge of capitulating</a>, which is what happened in mid-November, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/15/throwback-one-year-ago-50-bitcoin-price-dump-3000-began/">just before BTC began to tumble from $6,000 to $3,000</a>.</p>

      <p>Miner capitulating, for those unaware, is when “small miners get backed into a corner when BTC price is low &amp; the generation of mining hardware they use becomes obsolete.” The important part of this is that the capitulation of miners induces the sale of mined Bitcoin en-masse, pushing prices lower in a vicious cycle: “Undercapitalized miners panic sell, price dumps, longs get squeezed, stop losses cascade.”</p>
