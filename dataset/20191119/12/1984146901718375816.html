      <p>Police are searching for a potential key witness to a fatal hit-and-run in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumberland.</a></p>
      <p>Shortly after 10.30pm on Saturday October 19, police were called to Remscheid Way in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ashington">Ashington</a> after a report that a cyclist had been in collision with a vehicle.</p>
      <p>Emergency services attended and found the cyclist Adam Murray, 25, of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/blyth">Blyth</a> had suffered serious injuries after being struck by a Volkswagen Bora, which had then left the scene.</p>
      <p>Adam was taken to hospital with critical injuries but died two days later.</p>
      <p>He was described as a "much-loved man" and police said his family were being supported by specialist officers.</p>

      <p>A 38-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and remains under investigation.</p>
      <p>The Volkswagen Bora, which was believed to have been involved in the incident, was later found in the Rosalind Street area of Ashington.</p>
      <p>Through CCTV enquiries they have found a second cyclist was in the area in the moments before the collision and may have seen something that will assist the investigation.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Pinner Rana, of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">Northumbria Police’s</a> motor patrols department, said: “This was an awful incident that tragically claimed the life of a well-liked and much-loved man.</p>
      <p>“This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for Adam’s family and specialist family liaison officers are still supporting them at this difficult time.</p>
      <p>“We are committed to getting them answers and we hope the witness in this footage could help us piece together exactly what has happened. </p>
      <p>“I would like to thank the members of the public that have already provided footage to us and I urge any witnesses who are yet to come forward, or anyone who was passing through the area and may have dashcam footage, to pick up the phone and get in touch.”</p>
      <p>The man, or anyone who knows him, should contact police on 101 quoting reference log 1152 19/10/19. You can also report online at the Northumbria Police website.</p>
