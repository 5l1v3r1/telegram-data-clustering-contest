      <p>Nigel Farage has denied voting for the Brexit Party will split the Leave vote and lead to a Labour government.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a Peterborough rally, Mr Farage used the by-election in the city in the summer as an example to illustrate what he said would not be an issue.</p>
      <p>He described the by-election as a "two-horse race" and argued the Labour Party stole the Brexit Party's votes.</p>
      <p>He said: "They split our vote, if they were not here, we would have won.</p>

      <p>Mr Farage added: “The view that a vote for the Brexit Party will lead to a Corbyn government is wrong.”</p>
      <p>“We are going to fight like crazy in these seats. Labour have broken their promises and betrayed their voters.</p>
      <p>"Labour are the party of a second referendum.</p>
      <p>"We are going after those Labour voters and we will take a lot of votes.”</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party leader stressed the importance of having Brexit Party MPs in Westminster.</p>
      <p>He said: "If we don't get the Brexit Party voice in Westminster it becomes very easy for promises made to be forgotten.</p>
      <p>"They are acting like the masters and treating us like the servants.</p>
      <p>"Get some Brexit Party voices into Westminster and we will be the masters and they will be the servants."</p>

      <p>And he said the Brexit Party was the only party to inspire change and reverse a low turnout.</p>
      <p>"The lack of inspiration, I have to say, is worse on the Labour side than the Conservative side," Mr Farage said.</p>
      <p>"I predict it will be a low turnout unless people like us can get out and vote for change.</p>
      <p>"Someone out there needs to inspire people."</p>
      <p>He also mentioned the "generous gesture" he made to the Conservative Party by choosing not to stand Brexit Party MPs in Tory seats.</p>

      <p>But Mr Farage says he has only received "abuse" in return.</p>
      <p>And if Brexit Party MPs are elected into Westminster, aside from Brexit he said he planned to abolish the House of Lords and the current postal vote system.</p>
      <p>"If you get the direction I'm heading in, it's corrupt to its fingertips," Mr Farage said after making reference to "incentives" offered by the House of Commons.</p>
      <p>Addressing postal votes after a question from a member of the audience, he said: "It is is open to intimidation, it is open to fraud, we have seen all over the country.</p>
      <p>"People need to give a reason for why they want a postal vote."</p>
