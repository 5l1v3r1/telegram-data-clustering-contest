      <p>Hedge funds are preparing to profit if the U.S. and China reach a deal on trade, according to a Monday report from Goldman Sachs. </p>
      <p>At the beginning of the fourth quarter, the median China-exposed stock had 3.4% of market capitalization owned by hedge funds, up from 2.7% at the start of the third quarter, according to the report that analyzed the holdings of 833 hedge funds with $2.1 trillion of gross equity positions. </p>
      <p>The bet on China has paid off since trade tensions eased in mid-August, Goldman said. U.S. stocks with the highest reported sales exposure to China have returned 17% in the past three months, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Those returns are 7 percentage points higher than the S&amp;P 500, which has returned 10% in the same time period, Goldman said. </p>

      <p>Since the U.S. and China announced a phase-one trade deal in October, stocks have <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-today-sp-500-dow-nasdaq-post-record-highs-2019-11-1028694022?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">soared and even hit fresh highs</a> <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-today-indexes-hit-record-highs-on-trade-optimism-2019-11-1028670357?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">multiple times</a>, boosted by<a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/trade-war-ross-says-that-trade-war-talks-are-making-good-progress-2019-11-1028654812?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest"> positive news on trade</a> and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-today-indexes-hit-record-highs-on-trade-optimism-2019-11-1028670357?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">strong earnings</a> reports. </p>
      <p>Still, weeks later, uncertainty around the potential agreement remains. Trump <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/trump-isnt-ready-to-sign-china-deal-white-house-advisers-2019-11-1028693854?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">is reportedly not ready to sign a deal yet</a>, as the details are still being worked out. </p>
      <p>One of the most important details is around ending tariffs — China wants all tariffs to be lifted before signing a final deal, but Trump hasn't agreed to remove them, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in an <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/us-china-trade-deal-has-very-high-probability-of-happening-wilbur-ross">interview with Fox Business Network on Friday</a>.</p>
