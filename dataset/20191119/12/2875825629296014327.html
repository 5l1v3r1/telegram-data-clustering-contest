      <h1>Man Utd's Harry Maguire hoping for better reception at Sheffield United than Leicester</h1>
      <h2>Former Sheffield United and Leicester defender Maguire will visit his old club at Bramall Lane with Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:10:48+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:10</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Harry Maguire is relishing his return to boyhood club Sheffield United this weekend - and a better reception than he received from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> fans.</p>
      <p>Maguire, who joined <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> from Leicester for £80million last summer, was taunted by Foxes fans when the two sides met at Old Trafford in September, in a game the Reds won 1-0.</p>
      <p>But the 26-year-old, the world's most expensive defender, is looking forward to a friendlier welcome at Bramall Lane than he got from Leicester fans, who turned on him for leaving them.</p>
      <p>“I’ll be back at Bramall Lane and I'm sure I’ll get a better reception than I did from the Leicester fans when they came to Old Trafford!” said Maguire, who made 166 appearances for the Blades.</p>
      <p>“They've been great with me ever since, the Sheffield United fans, so I’ve got a lot to thank them for. The crowd got right on my side [from the start].</p>

      <p>“Sheffield United have started great in the Premier League but, when we play them, it’s going to be business for me.</p>
      <p>“I’ll be trying to get the three points off them but then hope they win every other game, apart from the ones against us.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been really lucky to have had a lot of experience in terms of playing games.</p>
      <p>“I played 50 games for three or four seasons at Sheffield United, every year.</p>
      <p>“That's something I really love doing. I love playing. For me, the best way to learn is by playing games.</p>

      <p>“I’ve been fortunate, in terms of the managers I’ve played for, that they've all picked me to start, especially in my younger days, when it’s harder as a young centre-back to get your chance to go and play.”</p>
      <p>Maguire recalled a classy gesture from his new club when he was knocked unconscious playing for the Blades at Old Trafford in 2011.</p>
      <p>The incident happened in the second leg of the FA Youth Cup final, when Maguire was involved in a collision with United striker Ravel Morrison, which saw him taken off on a stretcher.</p>
      <p>“It was just after half-time when it happened. I had a clash of heads with Ravel and actually got knocked out,“ Maguire told Inside United.</p>
      <p>"It was the only time I’ve been knocked out in my career, touch wood. It was a nasty blow and I was in hospital overnight.</p>
      <p>“Obviously it was disappointing to go off and not see the end of the game, when the medals and the trophy were presented.</p>
      <p>“But then someone got in touch from Manchester United and checked I was okay.</p>
      <p>“They sent me a Manchester United shirt, and just said: 'Good luck for the future, you’re a good, promising young player, keep your head down and so on.'</p>
      <p>“It was a nice touch from the club and just shows what a classy club United is.”</p>
      <p>United go into Sunday's clash in seventh place, two spots and a point below Chris Wilder's side, who have taken the Premier League by storm in their first season back in the top flight.</p>
