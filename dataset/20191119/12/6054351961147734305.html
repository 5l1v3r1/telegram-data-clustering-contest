      <p><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.45255/title.a-tribe-called-quest-releases-new-phife-dawg-merch-for-his-47th-birthday">Phife Dawg</a> would’ve turned 49 on Wednesday (November 20) but sadly, the Tribe Called Quest MC passed away in 2015.</p>
      <p>In honor of the Hip Hop luminary’s upcoming birthday, ATCQ affiliate Consequence has shared a new song called “No Place Like Home” featuring Phife, which Cons says he started working on at the same time Tribe was crafting its 2016 album, <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/reviews/id.2854/title.review-a-tribe-called-quest-do-the-damn-thing-on-we-got-it-from-here-thank-you-4-your-service"><i>We got it from Here…Thank You 4 Your service. </i></a></p>
      <p>“Phife and I worked on ‘No Place Like Home’ in the same time frame as the beginning stages of the last Tribe LP,” Cons said in a press release. “Even though he was living in The Bay during the last years of his life, we kept in touch frequently and I even brought my son Caiden to meet him in person while he was in New York, which led to both of us making a cameo appearance in his last solo video.”</p>

      <p>Cons continued, “A couple of months later Phife, unfortunately, passed away and Q Tip asked me to re-join Tribe to help make sure the last LP represented us and Phife’s legacy to the fullest. Once we released <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.41258/title.sales-projections-are-in-for-a-tribe-called-quests-we-got-it-from-here-thank-you-4-your-service"><i>We got it from Here, Thank You 4 Your service,</i></a> I always knew I wanted people to hear this record, but it just felt like the timing had to be right. This year it feels right.”</p>
      <p>Phife struggled with diabetes for the majority of his life. He died from complications of the disease on March 22, 2015, a day before the “Flawless” video dropped. Cons believes the new song is the best way to honor him.</p>
      <p>“The one thing I know about Phife is that he’s a rapper’s rapper,” he added. “The best gift I could give him for his birthday this year is to let the world hear the ‘5 Foot Assassin’ once again!”</p>
      <p>“No Place Like Home” was produced by Consequence and Mike Cash, with additional production from Fede Vindver and Rich Keller and will be available on all digital platforms beginning Wednesday (November 20).</p>
