      <p>Disney film Frozen redefined the meaning of ‘true love’ for the younger generation. In a chat with <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a>, Frozen 2 director duo Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck revealed the reason behind turning the idea of true love on its head.</p>
      <p>Elaborating on it, Chris said, “I was just pitching an idea. Trying to show that the act of true love was not only a kiss from the prince. We have done that, and we have done it very well. The question was what can we do differently. There are many forms of true love, and one of those is familial love. The family has strength. And we wanted to explore the love between family members, especially two sisters. The studio was thrilled about that. We knew that it was going to be the act of true love. It is going to be just between these two sisters,” the director said.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Lee chimed in, saying that she was thrilled about the idea of introducing ‘sister love.’</p>
      <p>She said, “As a writer, it was the most delicious idea. We talked a lot about relationships. We were able to differentiate between what we see, what we feel and what turns out to be the reality. Like the guy who walks in and looks like perfection isn’t (perfect) nine times out of 10. It’s not how it works. With family, the power is deeper and overwhelming. Fairy-tales help to feel without taking on that journey.”</p>

      <p>Animated films often tend to celebrate women and the power they hold much more than other films made across the globe.</p>
      <p>Sharing her two cents on the same, Jennifer Lee said, “I don’t think I can break it down to one thing like that. I think every film reflect the filmmaker themselves and the time that they were made in. For me, the best thing is when people get different things out of them. I tend to get nostalgic for a lot of classic films for many different reasons. So, I won’t be able to generalise in a good way.”</p>
      <p>Frozen 2 will see Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, Jonathan Groff, Josh Gad, and Santino Fontana return to voice their respective characters.</p>
      <p>Sterling K. Brown, Evan Rachel Wood, Alfred Molina, Martha Plimpton, Rachel Matthews and Jason Ritter join the film in the sequel.</p>
      <p>Frozen 2 will hit Indian screens on November 22.</p>
