      <p>The Liberal Democrats would give the NHS a £35 billion boost by raising income tax by a penny if they gain power.</p>
      <p>The money, delivered over five years, would be in addition to a £10 billion capital fund to upgrade equipment, ambulances, hospitals and other NHS buildings, health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said.</p>
      <p>The income tax increase would deliver £7 billion a year and be ring-fenced for use in the NHS and social care, the party added.</p>
      <p>Ms Berger pledged to tackle staffing shortages in the NHS by retaining free movement of labour, reinstating nursing bursaries and setting up a national workforce strategy to match training places to future needs.</p>
      <p>The party also said it would end the current shortfall of GPs by 2025.</p>

      <p>Ms Berger said: ‘The NHS is struggling to cope with severe staff shortages, chronic underfunding and crumbling hospital buildings.</p>

      <p>‘All of these problems would be made much worse by a Tory or Labour Brexit that would end free movement and make it harder to attract nurses and doctors from the EU.’</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘We are the only party with a credible plan to protect the NHS, by tackling the staffing crisis, investing in mental health services, social care, public health and making our NHS buildings fit for the 21st century.’</p>
      <p>The 1p rise would apply to the basic, higher and additional rates of income tax, the party said.</p>
      <p>Of the £35 billion, £32.2 billion would be spent in England, £1.8 billion in Wales and £1 billion in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>The measure would not apply to Scotland, where income tax policy is devolved.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats are currently polling at around 15%, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/tories-surge-ahead-election-polls-ahead-tv-debate-11179542/">according to the latest data</a>.</p>
