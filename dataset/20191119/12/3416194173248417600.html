      <p>Former Disney Channel and Disney XD star <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/jason-earles/"><b>Jason Earles</b></a> helped show the ropes to the cast of <i><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/high-school-musical/"><b>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</b></a></i>!</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old actor, who starred as Jackson Stewart on <i>Hannah Montana</i> and as Rudy Gillespie/Bobby Wasabi on <i>Kickin’ It</i>, revealed that he actually worked as a mentor and acting coach on the new Disney+ series.</p>
      <p>“Spent 6 Months in Salt Lake working with this amazing group, as an acting coach and mentor of sorts. By the end, we were all just family,” he shared on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4xyP7AhNm_/">Instagram</a>.</p>
      <p>“It was humbling to watch these insanely gifted people work to constantly be better, and never settle. I am so proud of how the show turned out. Heartfelt and funny, it’s totally original but respectful of its history, and filled with amazing new music,” <b>Jason</b> added.</p>
      <p>“So happy the world can finally watch these guys on Disney+ and see what I see…the next generation of Disney Stars. Congrats! Love all you guys! Can’t wait for Season 2 😉,” he concluded.</p>
