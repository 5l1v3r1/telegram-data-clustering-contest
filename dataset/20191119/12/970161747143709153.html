      <p>A partially-sighted woman says she has been barred from her local charity shop because she ’causes too much trouble’.</p>
      <p>Brenda Forrest, 87, said staff at the YMCA charity shop where she lives in Formby Village, Merseyside, told her she had to leave after asking customers to read aloud the prices of items to her.</p>
      <p>Brenda told the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/brenda-87-barred-charity-shop-17277525">Liverpool Echo</a> that she went in to buy a shirt for her husband Lesley, 91, on Sunday, when she was told if she refused to leave staff would ‘phone the police’.</p>
      <p>The pensioner, who is also deaf and recently came out of hospital, said the threat left her ‘petrified’ and added she had done nothing wrong.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘It’s the first time I’ve been into the shop since August.</p>
      <p>‘I walked into the shop yesterday and after I’d walked three quarters of the way around because I was looking for something for my husband – that’s all, I wasn’t being intrusive – this woman comes over all of a sudden.</p>

      <p>‘She said “you’re barred from here, you shouldn’t be in this shop”.</p>
      <p>‘I said “I beg your pardon?” and she said, “you know you’re barred from this shop because you come in here and you cause trouble”.’</p>

      <p>Brenda said the only behaviour she can think of that could be considered ‘trouble’ is that she asks other shoppers to tell her the prices of items that she is unable to see.</p>
      <p>She added: ‘I never cause any trouble, I’m an old lady. I went back to the counter and I said “can I have a quiet word with you or someone senior?”</p>
      <p>‘I just wanted to tell her that I can’t see the prices so I have to get people to help me read things.</p>
      <p>‘She said “get out now or I will call the police”.</p>
      <p>‘I was petrified. I was on my way out of the door anyway but it made me feel angry because I do not go around causing trouble at all.</p>
      <p>‘My family were livid when I got home and told them.’</p>
      <p>Brenda said she also got in trouble with staff at the shop earlier this year when she bought a chest of drawers and was told delivery would cost £20.</p>

      <p>She claimed a manager ‘confronted’ her for ‘discussing the costs of delivering furniture with other customers’.</p>
      <p>Brenda said: ‘She said “I believe you come in here every week causing trouble and it’s offending the customers”.</p>
      <p>‘I paid for a chest and I paid for the £20 for it to be delivered with no objection whatsoever.’</p>
