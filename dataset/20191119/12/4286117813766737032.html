      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>AAP attacked BJP as its 3 MPs missed Lok Sabha debate on air pollution</li>
        <li>Harsh Vardhan, Hans Raj Hans and Ramesh Bidhuri were missing from the lower house during the debate</li>
        <li>Through a sarcastic tweet, the AAP alleged that the BJP is taking pollution lightly</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Aam Adami Party on Tuesday once again trained its guns on the Bharatiya Janata Party for allegedly taking the problem of air pollution in the national capital lightly. The AAP slammed three BJP MPs from Delhi who missed the debate in Lok Sabha on the issue of air quality.</p>
      <p>Harsh Vardhan, Hans Raj Hans and Ramesh Bidhuri were missing from the lower house during the air pollution debate on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"BJP Delhi's MPs were missing from the parliament during the important debate on pollution. But when it will be time to hold a meeting for spreading lies about water, all MPs will be present," the AAP said on Twitter, referring to BJP's allegations that the water supplied in Delhi homes was not fit to drink. The AAP has dismissed the charge.</p>
      <p>Taking a sarcastic tone, the tweet by AAP added: "<i>3 sansad pollution ki meeting par nahin pahunche toh kya badi baat hai? Kyun Manoj Tiwari? </i>[What's the big deal if 3 MPs did not make it to debate on pollution? Isn't it, Manoj Tiwari]"</p>

      <p>According to sources in the BJP, when Lok Sabha took up pollution matter, Union minister and BJP MP from Chandni Chowk Harsh Vardhan was addressing Rajya Sabha. While, sources said, Hans Raj Hans was out of Delhi for 'official work'. BJP leader Ramesh Bidhuri, who represents South Delhi Lok Sabha constituency, was busy because of his son's wedding, sources said.</p>
      <p>Apart from the three MLAs, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari was also missing at the start of the debate but he later returned to the House.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the three BJP Delhi MPs present throughout the debate were Pravesh Sahib Singh, Minakshi Lekhi and Gautam Gambhir.</p>
      <p>Gambhir recently came under heavy AAP fire for missing out on a crucial air pollution meeting to attend a sports engagement. His photo, in which he can be seen eating jalebis, went viral.</p>
