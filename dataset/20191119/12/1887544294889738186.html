      <h1>Trans Mountain received $320M in government subsidies in first half 2019: report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:46:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:46</time> by <a rel="author">Laura Kane, The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>The money included $135.8 million in direct subsidies and $183.8 million in indirect subsidies that were not clearly disclosed to taxpayers, says the report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.</p>
      <p>“This is a very large subsidy. It really does require more public discussion and public disclosure,” says Tom Sanzillo, the group's director of finance.</p>
      <p>The document is public but presents a consolidated picture of the development corporation's finances, including revenues from the Canada Hibernia Holding Corp., which operates the Crown's interest in oil reserves off Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
      <p>“It's a good form of accounting. I'm not criticizing it. It just shouldn't be the only mechanism for showing the public how much money is being spent on this,” he says.</p>
      <p>The Canada Hibernia Holding Corp. covered the interest on the equity investment for the first half of 2019, representing a direct subsidy of $46.3 million, the report says.</p>
      <p>However, the loss is subsidized in the consolidated financial report by the Hibernia corporation's earnings, amounting to another $10.9-million direct subsidy, the report says.</p>
      <p>Canada's 4.7 per cent interest rate stands in contrast with the 12 to 15 per cent rate of return used by its former owner, Kinder Morgan, the report says.</p>
      <p>That amounts to an indirect subsidy of $183.8 million for the first six months of the year, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The report authors acknowledge that the Canadian government does not have to adhere to commercial standards.</p>
      <p>“(The report) is about transparency and not meant to be a legal challenge to the right of the Canadian government to subsidize the pipeline project. It is a matter of dollars at risk that the Canadian taxpayer might absorb,” it says.</p>
      <p>The Canadian government plans to ultimately sell the pipeline. If it does so for a lower price than it paid for the infrastructure, it can legally forgive any debt that is left over, Sanzillo adds.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 19, 2019.</p>
