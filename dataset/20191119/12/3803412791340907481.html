      <p>Apple's iPhone 11 may be here, but that doesn't mean the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/deal/57b81ec0?mnsid=mbnx3-21&amp;tag=mbnx33-21&amp;ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU60069YYw">iPhone XS</a> isn't a stellar option if you're in the market for an upgrade. Right now over on Amazon UK, customers can take advantage of Amazon's Deal of the Day, and snag <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/deal/57b81ec0?mnsid=mbnx3-21&amp;tag=mbnx33-21&amp;ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU60069YYw">up to 19% off a renewed iPhone</a>. Not only is the XS Max still a brilliant phone, this deal comes backed by Amazon's 1-year Renewed Guarantee. Renewed Amazon products look and work like new, they aren't Apple-certified but will have a battery capacity of at least 80%.</p>
      <h3>One-year warranty included</h3>
