      <h1>Couple 'disappointed' to find Aldi label on Waitrose vegetables</h1>
      <h2>The incident brought up questions over whether customers are paying for food quality or just the brand's label</h2>

      <p>When a couple's Ocado delivery arrived, they were surprised to see their Waitrose 'Mediterranean Roasting Vegetables' had an Aldi label on it.</p>
      <p>The front of the packaging appears completely normal but the underside was sporting the Aldi logo, saying the vegetables had been 'specially prepared' for the budget supermarket.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7694571/Outraged-couple-Aldi-stickers-covering-Waitrose-Mediterranean-roast-vegetables.html">Mail Online</a> , the husband who wishes to remain anonymous, said: "I was really disappointed. I use Waitrose and Ocado for good reasons - reputation and home delivery.</p>
      <p>"And I pay for the privilege.</p>
      <p>"No disrespect to Aldi or their customers but if I wanted their products I'd go to one of their stores."</p>
      <p>Aldi do sell a similar product to Waitrose, called Ready to Roast Winter Roast/Mediterranean Roast; Aldi's cost £1.29 while the product from Waitrose retails at £2. Both products are the same weight.</p>

      <p>The couple sent a complaint to Ocado (British online supermarket) who said they're reporting the incident to their supplier and apologised for the inconvinience.</p>
      <p>People have taken to Twitter to give their opinion on the matter.</p>
      <p>One said: "well I know now that Aldi's quality is the same as Waitrose and much cheaper."</p>
      <p>Another said: "I'd rather shop at Aldi and have extra money for gin!"</p>
      <p>One woman said: "So much supermarket produce is made in the same factories... [it's] made to slightly different [specifications], hence various price points".</p>
      <p>A spokesperson from Waitrose reached out and said: "We are sorry that there has been an error with the labelling at our suppliers and we are now looking into this. <br/><br/>"As with all retailers, we will share suppliers for some of our products. <br/><br/>"Any price variation will be reflected in the different specification of the product, such as ingredients used."</p>
