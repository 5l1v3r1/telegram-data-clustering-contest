        <b>Heloise Letissier has spoken out</b>
      </p>
      <p>Christine and The Queens’ singer Heloise Letissier has clarified her position after she criticised Taylor Swift over her LGBTQ anthem ‘You Need To Calm Down’.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a29126953/christine-and-the-queens-cosmopolitan-november-cover/">Cosmopolitan </a>last month, Letissier said she wasn’t impressed by Swift’s video featuring a roster of gay stars including <i>Queer Eye</i>’s Fab Five.</p>
      <p>She said that she was “conflicted” at the time” and stressed that “the core of the queer aesthetic cannot be sold.”</p>
      <p>Now, she has said that the resulting coverage was deduced to “the sexist narrative of a cat fight” and explained that it was never meant to be a direct dig at Swift.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t comment on that situation because as it happened I thought ‘Oh there it goes,” she said in a new interview.</p>

      <p>“The old trope of women being pitted against each other. This was not even a conversation aimed at someone specific. When I said ‘Queer cannot be sold’, I really truly do believe it. It’s not even a diss. It’s just a reality because I do believe that queer itself is a deconstruction of capitalism, so it cannot be digested.</p>
      <p>“So then I was like, ‘Oh really original’. To make it about two women hating each other when it’s actually not the case because I believe in sisterhood.”</p>
      <p>She added: “I don’t actually want to stop saying those things though. When I started I remember it was actually tougher to speak about those issues, especially in France. “</p>
      <p>Christine later concludes: “I will always remember that queer is dangerous and talk about that because it saved me at a point in my life.”</p>
      <p>Swift’s video also faced criticism from NME, who said: “Swift’s casting of homophobes as stereotypical rural types with unkempt hair, missing teeth and misspelt signs (“homasekualty is sin!” reads one slogan) – feels to be missing the point. Besides the sign-waving antics of the Westboro Baptist Church, this is not what homophobia usually looks like. As we’ve been reminded in recent months, you can’t spot a homophobe on sight (though that’d certainly make avoiding them a lot easier).”</p>
      <p>Last week, Swift released <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/listen-taylor-swifts-new-song-beautiful-ghosts-cats-soundtrack-2568281">‘Beautiful Ghosts’, her new ballad from ‘Cats’</a></p>
