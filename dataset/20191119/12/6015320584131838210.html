      <p>The Department of Justice of the United States has announced that a federal grand jury has charged an Indian national with two accounts of aggravated sexual abuse and one account of abusive sexual contact.</p>
      <p>According to a statement released by Department of Justice, the federal jury in the District of Columbia charted the 35-year-old Lokesh Naik with two counts of aggravated sexual abuse and one count of abusive sexual contract on on Nov. 6, 2019.</p>
      <p>The statement further added “U.S. military authorities in Afghanistan arrested Naik on Nov. 8, 2019, and his initial appearance was held before U.S. Magistrate Judge Harvey via video teleconference, at which time Naik was ordered detained and removed to the United States pursuant to the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA).”</p>
      <p>According to the indictment, on Aug. 7, while working as an employee of a U.S. military contractor on Operating Base Fenty, Afghanistan, Naik allegedly entered the room of a 24-year-old U.S. national and sexually assaulted her by force.</p>
      <p>The Department of Justice also added in its statement that “The charges in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.”</p>
