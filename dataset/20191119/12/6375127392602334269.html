      <h3>JERRICK Balanza and Letran completed an inspiring comeback for the ages.</h3>
      <p>Saving his  best for last, Balanza dropped 27 points and produced a huge defensive stop in the dying seconds as the gritty Knights ended San Beda's three-year reign with an 81-79 victory in the NCAA men's basketball tournament last night before 19,876 fans at the Mall of Asia Arena.</p>
      <p>Balanza blocked Evan Nelle's potential championship-winning triple as Letran made the improbable possible in a fitting ending to a classic best-of-three championship series.</p>
      <p>After being diagnosed with a brain tumor that sidelined him the rest of the second round and in the Final Four last year, Balanza had a triumphant return and ended his collegiate career as a champion once more for the Knights.</p>
      <p>"Sobrang bait ni God. Sobrang sarap sa pakiramadam. Nagpapasalamat ako sa Letran community," said Balanza. "Ito ang ginawa kong way para pasalamatan ko sila."</p>
      <p>The Knights pulled off a shocker, winning the series opener by slimmest of margins and were a Bonbon Batiller lay-up away from capturing the title in Game 2.</p>
      <p>This time around, Letran won't be denied in delivering championship banner No. 18 - and the first since 2015--where Balanza was a rookie.</p>
      <p>With the abrupt departure of coach Aldin Ayo, the Knights struggled for the next two years before making it back to the Final Four last season.</p>
      <p>For Letran, it's all about never giving up despite finishing as the third-ranked team in the elimination round with a 12-6 record.  The Muralla-based squad defeated San Sebastian and Lyceum of the Philippines University in the step-ladder semis to make it to the Finals.</p>
      <p>"There is always a reason for everything," said coach Bonnie Tan, who is on his first season with the Knights. "The boys deserve this. They worked hard for this."     </p>
      <p>So dominant after winning their first 18 matches, the Red Lions crumbled in the league's biggest stage, becoming the second team after the 2017 Pirates squad to fail to win the championship after recording a perfect 18-0 elimination round record.</p>
      <p>"Mahirap, pero walang imposible. Stay positive, yun ang sinasabi ko sa kanila," said Tan. "We treated each game as a championship game."</p>
      <p>Batiller was the other Letran player in double digits with 19 points while Fran Yu had team-bests seven assists and three steals.</p>
      <p>Yu was named the Finals MVP to add up from his Most Improved Player award after averaging 13 points, 6.6 assists and 3.3 rebounds in the series.</p>
      <p>In his final game for San Beda, Cameroon's Donald Tankoua had 22 points and seven rebounds.</p>
      <p>The Knights built a 79-73 lead on a Balanza triple, but the Lions didn't just roll over and die in the final 1:26.</p>
      <p>Nelle's back-to-back triples put San Beda to within 79-81 and the Lions had a chance to turn things around after forcing a jumpball with 5.4 seconds remaining in the clock.</p>
      <p>But Balanza was there to save the day for Letran.</p>
      <p>Earlier, San Beda needed a huge third quarter to plummel LPU, 98-77, to annex its 24th juniors crown.</p>
      <p>Rhayyan Amsali captured the Finals MVP award after a double-double effort of 16 points and 11 rebounds, helping  the Red Cubs emerge triumphant for the first time since 2015.</p>
      <p>Justin Sanchez led San Beda with 19 points, while Jay Ynot chipped in 18 points, eight boards, four assists and four steals.         The scores:</p>
      <p>Letran (81) -- Balanza 27, Batiller 19, Ular 9, Yu 8, Muyang 6, Mina 6, Caralipio 4, Ambohot 2, Balagasay 0, Olivario 0, Javillonar 0, Sangalang 0.</p>
      <p>San Beda (79) -- Tankoua 22, Oftana 18, Canlas 11, Nelle 11, Doliguez 11, Cariño 3, Soberano 3, Bahio 0, Abuda 0, Visser 0.</p>
      <p>Quarterscores: 26-24, 44-38, 69-59, 81-79</p>
