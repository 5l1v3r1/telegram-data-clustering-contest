      <p>I’m a Celebrity’s camp could be about to get bigger with the tease of potential new arrivals on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a>.</p>
      <p>Alison Hammond and John Barrowman have flown over to Australia for behind-the-scenes info and featuring on spin-off Extra Camp.</p>
      <p>So naturally, Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield couldn’t resist asking the question on everyone’s lips – are we about to see</p>
      <p>The usually chatty pair then went quiet before Allison teased: ‘To be honest with you, I’ve been trying to find out a little bit of gossip. I’ve been going into offices, going into the galleries…but everything is literally on lockdown.’</p>

      <p>‘There are rumours but we don’t know anything, if I’m honest,’ she added. ‘I have tried.’</p>
      <p>‘All the boards on the walls about what’s happening – you can kind of look, but it’s all kept very undercover, very secretive,’ John added. ‘So if it’s going to happen, it’s going to be a surprise not only to everyone in the camp, but to all of us watching.’</p>

      <p>‘And everyone’s got codenames as well!’ added Allison.</p>
      <p>It’s currently heavily rumoured that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/im-celebrity-2019-line-mystery-solved-andrew-whyment-entering-jungle-not-alone-11124477/">Andy Whyment</a> (aka Kirk from Corrie) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/former-eastenders-star-cliff-parisi-revealed-secret-12th-im-celebrity-campmate-11173036/">and Cliff Parisi (aka Minty from Eastenders)</a> will be heading into the show as the final two campmates.</p>
      <p>Show sources say that the pair will be joining the show together at some point in the next week.</p>
      <p>The two actors will join a camp that has already been through a lot, after the opening episode saw the contestant face bugs, sweat <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/ant-dec-open-im-celebrity-hilarious-prince-andrew-sweat-dig-11172692/">(if it’s medically possible, some people can’t</a>) and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebritys-nadine-coyle-in-tears-as-shes-comforted-by-caitlyn-jenner-over-skydiving-challenge-11168416/">tears</a>.</p>
      <p>Tonight’s episode will see the luxury (if you can call it that camp) and the basic camp finally come together – after one more bushtucker trial that sees celebs have their heads trapped in globes.</p>
