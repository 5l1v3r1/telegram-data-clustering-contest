      <p>Singapore—A man arrested on October 27 after his mother and grandmother were found dead in adjacent flat units is now facing murder charges for their deaths.</p>
      <p>Twenty-two-year-old Gabriel Lien Goh, who was first charged with the murder of his mother, 56-year-old Lee Soh Mui, on October 28, <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/commonwealth-double-deaths-man-faces-second-murder-charge-over-grandmothers">was slapped with a second murder charge</a>, this time for the death of his grandmother, on November 18.</p>
      <p>Mr Goh’s grandmother was 90 years old.</p>
      <p>Mrs Lee was found dead at an apartment on the seventh storey of Block 7A Commonwealth Avenue, and the body of the grandmother who is believed to have succumbed to injuries she sustained, was found in an adjacent unit.</p>

      <p>It is yet to be disclosed to the media how she was injured.</p>
      <p>Police were alerted to an incident of two unnatural deaths at 7:24 pm on October 27th.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the Singapore Police Force said, ”Two women, aged 56 and 90, were both found lying motionless and were pronounced dead by paramedics at (the) scene.</p>
      <p>Preliminary investigations revealed that both the deceased and the suspect are related. A 22-year-old man was arrested in relation to the case and was charged in court on Oct 28.”</p>
      <p>Mr Goh was detained for three weeks for psychiatric assessment before appearing back in court on November 18. If he is convicted of the murders he may face the death penalty.</p>
      <h3>Commotion at HDB</h3>
      <p>At around 7:00 pm on the evening of October 27, a commotion on the ground floor of the Housing Board block caught the attention of neighbours, who said they heard people screaming and shouting.</p>
      <p>The police were called when Mr Goh began to attack other people were on the ground floor of the block.</p>
      <p>One eyewitness, 49-year-old KC Lam told<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/double-murders-at-commonwealth-avenue-22-year-old-arrested"> The Straits Times (ST)</a> Mr Goh, who was barefoot, dressed in a sleeveless shirt and shorts and who had bloodstains on his right hand, was seen walking in front of people who were on the way to prayers when he turned around and confronted the group.</p>
      <p>Mr Lam told ST, “He looked very aggressive from his eye contact, and when I tried to calm him down, he turned violent.”</p>
      <p>Mr Lam said Goh was trying to challenge everybody and had a very aggressive pose. He said Goh was saying something “but I couldn’t understand him. I can’t imagine what would have happened if he had ended up at the bus stop.”</p>
      <p>A second witness, 63-year-old Han Dong Guan, told ST that he heard Mr Goh say, “Call the Government to talk to me,” to Mr Lam.</p>
      <p>After Mr Goh hit Mr Lam, people attempted to calm the younger man down, but he got aggressive with them as well.</p>
      <p>Eventually, it took four men to stop Mr Goh from further attacking others. -/TISG</p>
