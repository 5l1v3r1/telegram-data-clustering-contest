      <h1>Barcelona will finally get rid of a liability in January’s transfer window</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:00:12+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Nishant Narayanan</a></address>
      <h3>Barcelona have made their final decision regarding Ivan Rakitic and look to sell the midfielder in the January transfer window.</h3>
      <p>Rakitic has had five impressive seasons with Barcelona, since his arrival in 2014, but has recently lost his importance under Valverde. The Croatian, previously the number one choice, has only managed to start two League games along with six substitute appearances this season.</p>
      <p>The speculations around the midfielder have continued to build amid interest from many European giants such as Inter Milan, Juventus, AC Milan, and Athletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>Blaugrana have <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/transfer-talk/news/barca-reject-rakitic-bid-from-premier-league-club_379731.html?t1574016978"><b>reportedly</b></a> rejected a 15 million euros offer from an anonymous Premier League club, as they value the former Sevilla player at around 35 million Euros.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/barcelona-want-to-sell-ivan-rakitic-in-the-january-transfer-window-a4289166.html"><b>London Evening Standard</b></a>, the Spanish giants are hoping to sell the 31-year-old in January but ultimately will depend on the player’s own choices. Rakitic will definitely have to demand a reasonable wage in order to finalize a midseason transfer. The midfielder has recently voiced his desire to simply play football, regardless of the Club.</p>
      <blockquote>“As I love football, I want to aspire to everything and I am thinking about how to change this situation and for me, it is very clear. I want to win more titles, here or anywhere, I want to go on to win the Champions League season, then the next and again after that. I will give my all until the last day and enjoy every training session,” said Ivan to <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191114/471607404274/rakitic-valdano.html"><b>Mundo Deportivo</b></a>.</blockquote>
      <p>Ivan’s current contract with Barca runs until June 2021. The Croatian international has made his mark at Catalonia, having scored 34 goals along with 38 assists in 278 matches in a Barcelona shirt.</p>
      <p>As January approaches, it becomes ever so evident that Rakitic will move away from the club, although the destination remains unclear.</p>
      <p>Which European club will acquire Ivan Rakitic?</p>
