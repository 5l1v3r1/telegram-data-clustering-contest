      <p>Britain’s manufacturers have been offered some respite as battered order books improved in November after a no-deal Brexit was avoided last month, according to a survey.</p>
      <p>The CBI’s industrial trends survey showed orders stood at their highest level since August, although still far below long-term averages, marking a pick up from the near-decade low levels last month.</p>
      <p>It showed the orders balance rose to minus 26 from minus 37 in November, while export orders also increased from the lowest levels since the financial crisis seen in October.</p>
      <blockquote>While the thick fog of uncertainty from a no-deal Brexit has lifted somewhat, the manufacturing sector remains under pressure<cite>Anna Leach, CBI</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Activity in the sector also stabilised, but remained under pressure as output by volume fell at a similar pace to October.</p>
      <p>Manufacturers also expect output to be largely flat over the next few months as the UK grapples with a snap General Election on December 12 and the next looming Brexit deadline of January 31.</p>
      <p>Anna Leach, deputy chief economist at the CBI, said: “While the thick fog of uncertainty from a no-deal Brexit has lifted somewhat, the manufacturing sector remains under pressure from weak global trade and a subdued domestic economy.</p>
      <p>“Order books remain below average, and output volumes continue to fall.</p>
      <p>“When taking into account the deteriorating outlook for manufacturing globally, it’s clear that the outlook for the sector remains precarious.”</p>

      <p>Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at the EY Item Club, said the better-than-expected survey result was welcome, but “does little to inspire confidence that better times lie just around the corner for the manufacturing sector”.</p>
      <p>He added the manufacturing sector is still set to act as a drag on wider economic growth in the final quarter of 2019, pencilling in growth of 0.2%.</p>
      <p>Mr Howard said: “Manufacturers have clearly taken a hit from prolonged Brexit uncertainty, which is extending business caution over investment decisions and the purchase of capital goods.”</p>
      <p>The CBI poll of 307 manufacturers showed that output declines were driven largely by the motor vehicles, metal products, and metal manufacture sectors.</p>
      <p>But this was offset by increased activity in mechanical engineering and plastic products sectors, alongside a boost from aerospace output.</p>
