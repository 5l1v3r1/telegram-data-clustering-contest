      <h1>Macy's becomes the latest victim of a Magecart skimming attack</h1>
      <h2>It claims only a 'small number' of customers were hit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:45:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author">INQUIRER staff</a></address>
      <p><b>US DEPARTMENT STORE</b> Macy's has fallen victim to a Magecart attack that saw customers' payment card details stolen. </p>
      <p>Macy's says it was alerted to the data breach on 15 October 2019. An initial investigation revealed that the company website, <a href="https://www.macys.com/">Macys.com</a>, was inappropriately communicating with some remote website under the control of a hacking group.</p>
      <p>The attack likely happened on 7 October 2019, according to Macy's, with an unauthorised third party adding malicious script on two web pages - the 'Checkout' and 'My Wallet' pages - enabling attackers to eavesdrop on sensitive information.</p>
      <p>The Checkout page conveyed information to hackers when a customer entered credit card details and hit the "place order" button.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the My Wallet page provided customers' private details, including their name, address, city, state, email address, phone number, debit/credit card number, card's security code, and more.</p>
      <p>The malicious script on the website was removed on 15 October 2019. After that, Macy's informed law enforcement agencies, as well as credit card issuers. </p>
      <p>Only a small number of customers were affected by the data breach, the company claimed. Those affected have been advised to monitor their payment card statements for any signs of fraudulent activity.</p>
      <p>"There is no reason to believe that this incident could be used by cyber criminals to open new accounts in your name," <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6552530-macy-s-notice-of-data-breach.html">the company added in its 'Notice of Data Breach'</a>.</p>
      <p>"Nonetheless, you should remain vigilant for incidents of financial fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and immediately reporting any suspicious activity to your card issuer."</p>
      <p>The company is offering a free year of the Experian IdentityWorks credit monitoring service to affected users.</p>
      <p>Macy's also stated that it has thoroughly investigated the matter and taken appropriate security measures to ensure that such incidents should not be repeated in future.</p>
      <p>A few months back, cybersecurity firm <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/web-threats/2019/08/no-summer-break-for-magecart-as-web-skimming-intensifies/">Malwarebytes warned e-commerce companies</a> of a summer surge in activity by web-skimming Magecart gangs, targeting organisations' online payments systems. The firm claimed that it had blocked 65,000 web-skimming Magecart data theft attempts in July alone. µ</p>
