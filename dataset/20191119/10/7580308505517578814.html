      <p>Bethenny Frankel’s former residence is finally off the market, someone just bought the two-bedroom condo and is ready to live like a real housewife, reports TMZ.</p>
      <p>The former ‘RHONY’ star recently slashed the listing price from $5 million to $3,995,000, equivalent of 1,448,187,500.00 in Nigerian Naira, and now it’s got a new mystery owner.</p>
      <p>The 2,392-square-foot SoHo loft looks amazing. It’s on a cobblestone street in the historic cast-iron district, with a wood-burning fireplace and a small balcony, the only one of its kind in the building.</p>
      <p>The home is decked out with walnut flooring throughout, plus an internal atrium and a sunken living room with 14-foot ceilings and triple-paned arched windows. The master bedroom includes a huge walk-in closet and a marble bathroom with a steam shower and soaking tub.</p>
      <p>Floor-to-ceiling glass windows encompass the bedrooms, and the second room comes with built-in speakers. There’s also a grand hallway perfect for displaying art, and a powder room. The building includes a common rooftop terrace.</p>
      <p>Bethenny Frankel is an American reality television personality, entrepreneur, and author. She was a contestant on the reality TV game show The Apprentice: Martha Stewart, in which she was the runner-up, in 2005.</p>
      <p>Frankel received wider notice after being cast on the Bravo reality television series The Real Housewives of New York City; she has starred in eight of its eleven seasons since it premiered in 2008.</p>
      <p>She received her own spin-off series Bethenny Ever After (2010–12), Bethenny &amp; Fredrik (2018), and the talk show Bethenny (2013–14).</p>
      <p>Outside of her work in reality television, Frankel is the founder of the Skinnygirl lifestyle brand and the author of four self-help books. Her “B Strong” program became active in disaster relief efforts in 2017.</p>
