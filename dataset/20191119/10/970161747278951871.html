      <p>Anti-government protestors holed up inside a Hong Kong university attempted to crawl through the sewer system in a desperate bid to escape police surrounding the building.</p>
      <p>Universities became the latest battleground for protests which have raged for months when demonstrators occupied several campuses, using petrol bombs along with bows and arrows to fend off riot police backed by armoured cars and water cannon.</p>
      <p>Those barricaded inside the Hong Kong Polytechnic building are the last to hold out.</p>
      <p>Officers have made a cordon around the building and are arresting anyone who leaves.</p>
      <p>Around a dozen protesters tried to flee through the university’s sewer system on Tuesday morning, with some seen lowering themselves into a tunnel wearing gas masks and plastic sheets to cover their bodies.</p>

      <p>City leader Carrie Lam said 600 people had left the Hong Kong Polytechnic campus, including 200 who are under 18 years old.</p>

      <p>Groups of protesters made several attempts to escape on Monday, including sliding down hoses to waiting motorcycles, but it was not clear if they evaded arrest.</p>
      <p>Ms Lam said those under 18 would not be immediately arrested but could face charges later. She said the other 400 who have left have been arrested.</p>
      <p>‘We will use whatever means to continue to persuade and arrange for these remaining protesters to leave the campus as soon as possible so that this whole operation could end in a peaceful manner,’ she said following a weekly meeting with advisers.</p>
      <p>After five months, the Hong Kong protest movement has steadily intensified as local and Beijing authorities harden their positions and refuse to make concessions.</p>

      <p>China, which took control of the former British colony in 1997 promising to let it retain considerable autonomy, flexed its muscles, sending troops outside their barracks over the weekend to help clean up debris strewn by protesters to block streets.</p>
      <p>The Chinese ambassador to Britain accused the UK and US of meddling in the country’s internal affairs and warned that the Chinese government ‘will not sit on our hands’ if the situation in Hong Kong ‘becomes uncontrollable’.</p>

      <p>Ms Lam, asked whether she would seek help from Chinese troops based in Hong Kong, said her government remains confident it is able to cope with the situation.</p>
      <p>China also hinted it might overrule the Hong Kong’s high court ruling on Monday to strike down a ban on face masks that was aimed at preventing protesters from hiding their identity to evade arrest.</p>
