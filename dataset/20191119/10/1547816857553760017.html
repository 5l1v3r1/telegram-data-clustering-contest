      <p>The actor was quoted as saying, “With this show, I am looking forward to getting back to my chocolate-boy image, the one I had in 'Just Mohabbat' (1996-2000) and the film, 'Tarzan — The Wonder Car' (2004). It feels great and different. I agree that it’s difficult to break the set image on TV, and people will expect me to do something crazy, but they will be shocked to see me in a different avatar.”</p>
