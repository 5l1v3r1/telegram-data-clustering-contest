      <p>AMD's Athlon brand name is still alive and kicking, more than 20 years after its original release back in June 1999. But while <i>Athlon</i> was once synonymous with AMD's premier performance desktop processors, the name has now been relegated to the company's <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/amd-launches-athlon-220ge-240ge-zen-cpus-intel-pentium">entry-level "budget" processors</a>. </p>
      <p>The latest entry into the family is the <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/athlon">Athlon</a> 3000G, which is AMD's first unlocked Athlon processor based on first-generation Zen microarchitecture. That means that this is a 14nm design, and it has a rated TDP of 35 watts. For those that like to overclock on an extreme budget, the Athlon 3000G comes from the factory with a base frequency of 3.5GHz. However, you should be able to easily boost frequencies given the maturity of <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/amd">AMD</a>'s original Zen architecture.</p>
      <p>The Athlon 3000G is a 2-core/4-thread processor using the tried and true AM4 socket, which means that it should work on just about any motherboard that you throw at it, and it features an integrated <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/radeon">Radeon</a> Vega 3 GPU. Other specs include 192KB L1 cache, 1MB L2 cache, and 4MB of L3 cache.</p>
      <p>Most importantly, however, is that the Athlon 3000G is priced at just $49, which will make it a popular option for bargain-basement systems where balls-to-the-wall performance isn't required at all times.</p>
      <p>The Athlon 3000G is at the complete opposite end of the spectrum as its most recent sibling: the <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/ryzen-9-3950x">Ryzen 9 3950X</a>. That 7nm <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/zen-2">Zen 2</a>-based barnstormer comes equipped with a whopping 16 cores and 32 threads, and will demolish just about every processor in its price class ($749).
