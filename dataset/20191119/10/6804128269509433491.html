      <h1>Eden Hazard makes prediction for Chelsea's Premier League clash with Manchester City</h1>
      <h2>Eden Hazard believes Chelsea can fare significantly better than they did in a 6-0 defeat to Manchester City last season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:26:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:26</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Challies</a></address>
      <p>Former Chelsea star Eden Hazard has shared his prediction for the Blues' Premier League clash with Manchester City this weekend, where he has backed Frank Lampard's side to secure a positive result.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/eden-hazard">Hazard</a>, now at Real Madrid, endured a match to forget in Chelsea's last trip to face Pep Guardiola's side after the Blues suffered a 6-0 hammering at the Etihad Stadium last season.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea </a>have shown their strength this season by fighting to joint-second in the Premier League standings, a single point ahead of <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/manchester-city">City</a>, and a victory this weekend will hand their chances of securing a top-four finish another boost.</p>
      <p>While Hazard admits it will not be an easy game for Chelsea, he believes that Chelsea's young squad have the capacity to secure a victory in the match.</p>
      <p>“Of course they can beat Man City. It’s not going to be easy, it’s hard to play there and last time we played there we lost 6-0,” he told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>“So it’s bad memories for me and for Chelsea as well but I think this season they are really good. They are really young but really good, so why not go there and win the game?”</p>
