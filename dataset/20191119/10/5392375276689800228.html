      <p>Galaxy Fold: Samsung explains how it came to this design<br/>5 (100%) 2 votes</p>
      <p>Samsung reveals behind the scenes of the design of the Galaxy Fold in a post published this Tuesday, November 19 on the website of the manufacturer. Called “From Concept to Creation: Designing the Galaxy Fold”, we learn several details about the development of the foldable smartphone, from the screen to the design through the packaging.</p>
      <p>Samsung foldable has required years and years of research and development. This device has its flaws and its qualities, but still remains an unprecedented technological innovation.</p>
      <h3>1000 prototypes before the final design</h3>
      <p>The manufacturer reveals that its teams have worked primarily on the folding of the smartphone. They studied how people fold things everyday. Such as a book, wallet, or mail, and especially what were the benefits of each fold.</p>
      <p>The design team then worked closely with the engineering teams to propose and shape the most aesthetically pleasing and practical form of folding. In total, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Samsung">Samsung</a> has built nearly 1000 prototypes with different materials and designs, before finding the final design of the Galaxy Fold.</p>

      <p>However, despite these years of research, the Galaxy Fold does not achieve perfection. It is certainly at the moment the best representative of foldable smartphones. But its extreme fragility makes its use rather complicated. The plastic screen protector manufactured by the Sumitomo company is far from being as resistant as a Gorilla Glass protection for example.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/from-concept-to-creation-designing-the-galaxy-fold?CID=afl-ecomm-cjn-cha-092118-52057&amp;cjevent=dd132b710a9c11ea813903270a180513">smartphone</a> is also extremely vulnerable to dust. These microscopic elements are easily installed in the hinge and damage this system reserved for folding.</p>
      <h3>The Galaxy Fold 2 is already in the work</h3>
      <p>The Galaxy Fold will have a rather short life cycle since work on its successor. The Samsung Galaxy Fold 2, is already well advanced. The device will be foldable like a flip phone, like the Motorola Razr 2019. The device should be cheaper than the first model and it should be officially presented at the MWC. To be held in Barcelona from 24 to 27 February 2020.</p>
