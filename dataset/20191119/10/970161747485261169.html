        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/robbie-williams/">Robbie Williams</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-william/">Prince William</a> got on like a house on fire when they met at the Royal Variety Show this week, with the pair seemingly cracking up at each other’s jokes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Before his performance the London Palladium on Monday night, Robbie lined up with the other guests to meet the Duke of Cambridge at this year’s prestigious entertainment concert and it seems he found a way to tickle the royal’s sense of humour.</p>
      <p>Looking dapper in a smart black suit and tie, Robbie was seen warmly greeting William with open arms and there’s no doubt the royal looked particularly pleased to see the outspoken popstar.</p>
      <p>At one point, it looked as though William was the one doing the entertaining as Robbie was seen throwing his head back in laughter.</p>
      <p>Robbie, 45, was accompanied by his wife Ayda Field for the night but she was nowhere to be seen while he chatted up a storm with William, 37.</p>

      <p>Before heading to the prestigious event, Ayda shared a photo of her Robbie posing in their outfits with the caption: ‘Excited to support @robbiewilliams at the @royalvarietyperformance tonight. Suit by @safiyaa_official jewellery and clutch by @williamandson.’</p>
      <p>It was the third time William and his wife Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, have attended the Royal Variety Show on behalf of the Queen, as they also watched in 2014 and 2017.</p>

      <p>The Angels singer was<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/28/robbie-williams-duet-rod-stewart-royal-variety-performance-christmas-surprise-10997473/"> scheduled to duet with Rod Stewart on It Takes Two</a>, a bonus track on the festive album, as well as Jamie Cullum on their cover of Merry Xmas Everybody.</p>
      <p>Other stars confirmed to take part in the Royal Variety Performance include cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who performed at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding last year, while Rob Beckett and Romesh Ranganathan are set to become the first comedic duo to host the ceremony in more than three decades.</p>
