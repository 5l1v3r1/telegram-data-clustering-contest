Speaking in the House, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chodhary said that Sonia and Rahul are not normal protectees. “Vajpayee ji had allowed Special Protection Group protection for the Gandhi family. From 1991-2019, NDA came to power twice but their SPG cover was never removed,” he said. Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu has ordered to review the new dress code of marshals in the House. Naidu said that he has asked the Rajya Sabha Secretariat to revisit the new military-style uniform. The Rajya Sabha proceedings were adjourned till 2 pm after opposition uproar over alleged police action on protesting JNU students and detention of political leaders in Jammu and Kashmir. Soon after the House transact business for the day, Left and other opposition party members raised the two issues. When the House met at 2 PM, it took up discussion on the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial (Amendment) Bill, 2019. The bill was cleared by the Lok Sabha in August.
