      <p>TORONTO – Most kids already have a long list of what they want for Christmas but they might not get as many of those things this year as they did in previous years.</p>
      <p>A new survey by the <a href="https://www.cpacanada.ca/">Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada</a> shows Canadians are planning to spend less.</p>
      <p>The average amount they’re planning to shell out for Christmas $583 dollars, down from $643 last year. A little more than 40 per cent of those polled say they didn’t set a budget, so sticking to the goal of spending less could be a challenge.</p>
      <p>One-in-five people told CPA Canada that they anticipated overspending during the holidays.</p>
      <p>CPA Canada says there are some ways to help you save money, including hunting for deals, saving money ahead of time, and find non-traditional gifts to put under the tree.</p>
      <p>Almost half of the respondents–46 per cent–anticipate doing their shopping the old fashioned way in stores.</p>
