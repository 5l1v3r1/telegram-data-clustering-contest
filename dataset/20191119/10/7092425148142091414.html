      <p>Roughly one in one four young people in Ireland suffer from severe anxiety.</p>
      <p>The latest My World Survey, carried out by UCD in conjunction with youth mental health organisation Jigsaw, spoke to more than 19,000 young people between the ages of 12 and 25.</p>
      <p>It is the largest survey of its kind in Ireland and shows the number of young people suffering from anxiety has doubled since the last survey was conducted in 2012.</p>

      <p>For those aged between 12-19, 22% reported severe or very severe anxiety, that is double the number in the last survey.</p>
      <p>For young adults, those aged 18-25, 26% were categorised as being in the severe to very severe anxiety category, an increase of 11% on the last study.</p>
      <p>The findings show that females are more likely to suffer with severe or very severe anxiety.</p>

      <p>15% of teenagers also reported severe depression, up from seven per cent, while the number of young adults was up seven to 21 per cent.</p>
      <p>Dr. Joseph Duffy, CEO of <a href="https://www.jigsaw.ie/"><i>Jigsaw</i></a>, says while young people today are more aware of their mental health, social media is having a big impact.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.98fm.com/news/anxiety-among-young-people-getting-worse-926559"><i>98FM</i></a>: "That really wasn't a significant feature back in 2011/2012. For some young people the longer they spend online that might impact on their ability to actually form social networks and they might be comparing themselves negatively in terms of body image or in terms of friendship networks."</p>
