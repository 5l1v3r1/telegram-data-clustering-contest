      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:18:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:18</time> by <a rel="author">David Anderson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-anderson/</a></address>
      <p>Callum Smith claims he will blow fighting at Anfield and all his other dreams if he loses to John Ryder on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Smith makes the second defence of his WBA Super super-middleweight title against Ryder in Liverpool’s M&amp;S Bank Arena and the Kopite is in line to fight at his beloved Anfield if he wins.</p>
      <p>The unbeaten Smith also dreams of fighting Gennady Golovkin or Canelo Alvarez in Las Vegas and knows none of this will happen if he slips up against Ryder.</p>
      <p>“Listen I’m switched on,” he said. “The fights that have been mentioned with Canelo, Golovkin, the big unification fights, there’re still there providing I come through this fight.</p>

      <p>“But if I lose this fight, they disappear. It’s a must win for me and it’s one more step towards those fights.</p>
      <p>“I know if I slip up, Anfield is gone. I’m fully focused on this one and if I get this one out of the way, I’ll speak to Eddie Hearn and see if he can deliver me a big fight in 2020.</p>
      <p>“I’ve trained hard. I’ve worked hard to become a world champion and I don’t plan on losing it just yet.”</p>

      <p>Smith, who is 26-0, is a big Liverpool fan, like his fighting brothers, and says he has imagined what it would be like to walk out at Anfield.</p>
      <p>“The last few times I’ve been there, I have sat in the crowd and just tried to imagine what the atmosphere would be like for me,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It would be massive for me. It is possible, but the timing has to be right and there’s no time like now because I’m a world champion.”</p>
      <p>Smith, 29, is relishing his homecoming and his last fight in Liverpool was in September 2017, a year before he became world champion.</p>
      <p>“I’m excited about that because when I was coming through as a young professional, I wasn’t known all over the country, but the people here they backed me from the start,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s nice to be able to bring a world title back to the city, which is something I always wanted to do. It’s a dream for me. It will be a special night for me, but the win is the most important thing.”</p>
