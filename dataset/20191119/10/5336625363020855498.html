      <h1>Grind your coffee — and brew it too — with this early Black Friday deal</h1>

      <p><b>TL;DR: </b>Get the time-saving<b> </b><a href="https://zdcs.link/w7Z2b">Chefman 4-Cup Grind &amp; Brew Coffee Maker</a> for $75, a 24% savings. </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Years from now, when we look back on the past from whatever flooded dystopia we call home, we’ll remember this moment as the age of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ok-boomer-gen-x-gen-z-millennials/">the "OK Boomer" clap-back</a>. </p>
      <p>The phrase is currently the go-to response to an out-of-touch older generation who offer up advice like “stop eating avocado toast and you could afford a house” or “make coffee at home and you’ll save enough to pay off your student debt." </p>
      <p>Whether you agree with Boomer sentiments or not, many of us — no matter our age — view a small pleasure like buying coffee as a rare concession in a tough world. Sure, we could save a bit of money if we made it at home, but not enough to get out of the red and onto the property ladder.</p>
      <p>But extra money is extra money, and a 10-minute wait for a flat white when you’re already late for work is the worst. So, wannabe-home barista, maybe you should know about the <a href="https://zdcs.link/w7Z2b">Chefman 4-Cup Grind &amp; Brew Coffee Maker</a>.</p>

      <p>The contraption is much like a normal coffee brewer, except that it grinds fresh coffee beans before filtering them into the pot. This ensures your coffee tastes like fresh coffee, not like burning or freeze-dried or sewage.</p>
      <p>The grinder and brewer combo makes up to four cups and can brew different strengths. It also works with pre-ground coffee, so don’t think you’ll have to exclusively buy whole beans from here on out. </p>
      <p><a href="https://zdcs.link/w7Z2b">You can get it for the sale price of $75</a>. Or you can enter code <b>BFSAVE15</b> at checkout and get it on sale for Black Friday before everyone else — just $63.75.</p>
