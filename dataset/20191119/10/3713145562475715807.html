      <h1>Facebook announces dates for its 2020 F8 developers conference</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:14:04+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:14</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Perez</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook">Facebook </a>announced its plans for its F8 annual developer conference, which is where the company shows off its latest technology, apps and its vision for the future. The company says the next event will take place on May 5-6, 2020 at the <a href="http://www.sanjose.org/convention-center">McEnery Convention Center</a> in San Jose, CA.</p>
      <p>Interested attendees can sign up at <a href="http://www.f8.com/">www.f8.com</a> to be notified when registration opens and receive updates.</p>
      <p>Last year, the company used the F8 event to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/f8-2019/">introduce</a> a huge <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/aspirationbook/">redesign of Facebook.com</a>, plus upgrades, products, and expansions in areas like Messenger, WhatsApp, Dating, Marketplace and beyond. It also showed off how it’s putting new technology to work, including with VR, smart home, hardware, and other developer-facing technology, including Facebook’s Ax and BoTorch initiatives.</p>
      <p>Facebook isn’t yet talking about what it will show off at F8 in 2020, but says it will feature: <i>“product demos, deep-dive sessions that showcase how technology can enable you to come together and create your best work, and opportunities for you to network with our global developer community and learn from each other,”</i> according to its announcement.</p>
      <p>Beyond the news that comes from F8 in terms of individual products, the conference gives Facebook a platform to present its overarching vision.</p>
      <p>Last year, for example, it was one of a network that’s trying to become more private and working to retain users. More recently, Facebook’s initiatives show a company that’s still trying to be disruptive, with new products like Libra. But some of its launches also demonstrate that the company is painfully aware of how much it’s ceding traction to other social apps, like Snapchat and TikTok. We’ll see if Facebook has any new responses to those challenges, or to the larger, more existential issues Facebook now faces with the rise of anti-trust investigations that put Facebook in their crosshairs.</p>
