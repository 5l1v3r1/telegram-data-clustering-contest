      <p>A hard-line newspaper in Iran is suggesting that those who led violent protests will be executed by hanging as the unrest continues.</p>
      <p>An article published Tuesday in the Keyhan newspaper made the claim, though Iranian authorities still have not offered a detailed accounting of the toll of the demonstrations that began Friday over <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/iran/why-did-iran-one-of-the-world-s-most-oil-rich-countries-just-hike-its-gas-prices-1.8137884">government-set gasoline prices rising</a>.</p>
      <p>The newspaper said: “Some reports say that judiciary considers execution by hanging for the riot leaders a definite punishment.”</p>
      <p>It did not elaborate.</p>
      <p>The protests appeared to be ongoing on Tuesday in some areas of the country, though the streets of Tehran appeared largely calm.</p>
      <p>It remains difficult to know the scale of the demonstrations. Iran shut down the internet Saturday, stopping protesters from sharing information and their videos online.</p>
