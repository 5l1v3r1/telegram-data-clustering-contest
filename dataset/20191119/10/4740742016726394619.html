      <h1>I'm a Celebrity viewers claim Caitlyn Jenner and Kate Garraway's trial was 'rigged'</h1>
      <h2>The pair struggled as they were subjected to thousands of critters on the ITV show</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:07:26+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:07</time> by <a rel="author">Sophie McCoid, Jasper King</a></address>
      <p>I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here fans have slammed the latest trial, claiming it was unfair on the two contestants, Caitlyn Jenner and Kate Garraway, the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-rigged-trial-gets-17278071">Liverpool Echo reports</a>.</p>
      <p>During the trial on the ITV show, Kate and Caitlyn were placed in a box 20ft up in the air and were subjected to all kinds of horrors including rats and creepy crawlies.</p>
      <p>The pair had to drop balls into a moving basket, but viewers slammed the trial, as several of the balls bounced out of the basket, with viewers saying they should have counted.</p>
      <p>The two celebrities were strapped into their cages and raised above a lake. Dec gave Kate some words of encouragement, "Come on Kate. Positive mental attitude." Kate replied, "I'm concentrating on surviving" as she tried to get comfortable in the box.</p>
      <p>The trial featured 30,000 cockroaches which were poured into each of the cages. The two celebrities then had to carefully aim and try and drop balls into the moving basket.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what do do, I can't think. They're going up my noo-noo," screamed Kate.</p>
      <p>After a few misses, Caitlyn managed to get a ball in the basket and so did Kate. The classics including crickets and mealworms joined the cockroaches and rats which were already in the cage.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn carefully aimed during the trial and a number of balls narrowly missed the basket and hit the rim. Kate was less careful but by the end of the trial both women had managed to drop two balls into the basket making a total of four meals for camp.</p>
      <p>Kate said: "Thank God, thank God," as the klaxon sounded and added: "That was so much more disturbing than I thought it would be.</p>
      <p>"It's a confined box which I find really scary, it's up very high and then you've got everything you've ever been scared of out of place."</p>
