      <p>Gabrielle Rowe appeared at Ballarat Magistrates' Court on Tuesday facing nine charges including theft, intentionally causing injury and breaching a community corrections order.</p>
      <p>Rowe has already spent 260 days in custody since being arrested in March and will return to court in December for a plea hearing.</p>
      <p>Police prosecutor Jamie Singh told the court Rowe entered JB Hi-Fi on Mair Street on February 23 and attempted to leave the store without paying for a bluetooth speaker she had placed in her bag.</p>
      <p>He said the security guard called the store manager, closed the doors to the store and asked Rowe to empty her bag.</p>
      <p>It is alleged Rowe attempted to push past the security guard before grabbing a box cutter from her handbag and slashing the store manager on his bicep, causing a 'large and deep' wound.</p>
      <p>Mr Singh said Rowe then threw the speaker on the ground and ran off. The incident was captured on CCTV footage.</p>
      <p>The court heard charges against Rowe also relate to six other alleged incidents, including causing criminal damage to a TAB, stealing Jim Beam from Dan Murphy, punching a woman and stealing her mobile phone at McDonalds Bakery Hill and stealing from Myer and Spotlight in Ballarat.</p>
      <p>An application for Rowe's case to be heard in the Magistrates' Court rather than the County Court was granted on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Gregory Robinson said he agreed the sentencing powers of the Magistrates' Court were sufficient for Rowe's case.</p>
      <p>Ms Sharpley told the court Rowe had engaged in a number of programs and education since she entered custody in March.</p>
      <p>The court also heard Rowe was on drugs during the time of offending but had been 'clean' during her time in custody.</p>
      <p>Rowe's grandparents, father and stepmother were present to support her in court.</p>
      <p>Ms Sharpley indicated to the court she would be seeking a sentence of imprisonment in combination with a community corrections order.</p>
      <p>Rowe will be assessed for a community corrections order before she returns to the Ballarat Magistrates Court on December 19 for a plea hearing when the court will hear victim impact statements.</p>
