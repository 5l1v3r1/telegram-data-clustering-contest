      <h4>In case you didn’t know</h4>
      <p>Shahadat had been a regular in the Bangladesh set-up during the late 2000s and the early 2010s when he made a total of 95 appearances for his country across all formats. The fast-bowler played 38 Tests, 51 ODIs and 6 T20Is during that period.</p>
      <p>Shahadat's name was embroiled in controversy back in 2015 when he was found guilty of a similar offence when he attacked his household help. The above also led to a ban and a bit of time away from the game.</p>
      <h4>The heart of the matter</h4>
      <p>The incident occurred during a match between the Dhaka Division and the Khulna Division when Shahadat and Arafat got into a confrontation regarding the way the ball was being shined.</p>
      <p>The fight got so severe that teammates of the aforementioned players had to step in to stop Shahadat from inflicting more damage.</p>
      <p>Consequently, the fast-bowler copped a BDT 1 Lakh fine from the Bangladesh Cricket Board, an amount which roughly equates to USD 1200.</p>
      <h4>What’s next?</h4>
      <p>Shahadat has not played for Bangladesh since 2015 and the tenure of his ban seems likely to end his international career. Though the pacer might still harbour hopes of a comeback into the domestic circuit, it seems a long road to redemption at this juncture.</p>
