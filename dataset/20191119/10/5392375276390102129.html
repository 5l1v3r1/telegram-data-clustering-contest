      <h1>Taiwan's 5G spectrum bidding will commence on December 10 -</h1>

      <p>The development of <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/5G">5G</a> is still on-going and there are many regions in the world that are yet to commence 5G development. One of the first steps to 5G commercialization is the auctioning of 5G spectrum. According to Taiwan media reports, Taiwan’s 5G spectrum will start bidding on December 10. For Taiwan’s 5G spectrum bidding, 3.5GHz, 2.8GHz, and 1.8GHz bands will be available. The 3.5GHz band is the most sought-after in the bidding.</p>

      <p>A local official, Cai Zhihong, said that after repeated tests, everyone gradually discovered that the 3.5GHz band is not only flat but also open, which is suitable as the middle point of development. Moreover, all countries and regions in the world regard 3.5GHz as a springboard to high frequency. With these qualities, it has gradually become the main frequency band of 5G.</p>
      <p>“(5G) spectrum planning must follow the world’s ecosystem. Today’s world trend is 3.5GHz.” Cai Zhihong said.</p>
      <p>NGC Chairman, Chen Yaoxiang, also said that in the past due to technical limitations, the 3.5GHz band was lacking. However, with the gradual development of 5G technology, 3.5GHz has gradually gained attention, and the construction of various countries has also developed in this frequency band. This makes it the “mature frequency band”.</p>
