      <p>Attribute to Superintendent Karyn Malthus, Auckland City District Commander:</p>
      <p>Police acknowledge a report by the Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA) in relation to the use of a Police dog during the arrest of a man in Auckland last year.</p>
      <p>On November 8, 2018, Police were executing a search warrant at a commercial premise in Penrose in search of an armed offender believed to be involved in the manufacture and supply of methamphetamine, who also had warrants for their arrest.</p>
      <p>Police, using AOS officers, entered the address and encountered a man who appeared to be warning others at the premise and resisted attempts by officers to arrest him.</p>
      <p>A Police dog handler used his dog to bite the man’s leg, which enabled Police officers to arrest him and remove him from the scene.</p>
      <p>The IPCA found that Police were justified in using a Police dog during the arrest.</p>
      <p>The authority also determined that Police were lawfully justified in detaining the man during the search warrant and concluded that Police provided the man with appropriate and timely medical care.</p>
      <p>Superintendent Karyn Malthus says the nature of Policing can be dynamic and unpredictable.</p>
      <p>“Our police officers regularly find themselves in dangerous situations.</p>
      <p>The officers involved in this incident took reasonable steps to quickly detain a man in a fast-paced situation where Police were searching for a potentially armed offender,” says Supt.</p>
      <p>Malthus.</p>
