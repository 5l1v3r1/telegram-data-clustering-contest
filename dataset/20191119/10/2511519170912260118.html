      <p>The <i>Trainspotting</i> star, most recently seen in BBC series <i>Girl/Haji</i>, will play Detective Chief Inspector Joanne Davidson, the senior investigating officer of an unsolved murder, whose unconventional conduct raises suspicions at AC-12.</p>
      <p>She'll be investigated by superintendent Ted Hastings (Adrian Dunbar), DS Steve Arnott (Martin Compston) and DS Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure), who'll all return for the sixth series.</p>
      <p>The show's creator Jed Mercurcio said: "We're honoured that Kelly Macdonald will join Martin, Vicky and Adrian in series six of <i>Line of Duty</i>. DCI Joanne Davidson will prove the most enigmatic adversary AC-12 have ever faced."</p>
