      <h1>Paris Saint-Germain propose Neymar swap deal to Barcelona</h1>

      <h3>Barcelona are keen to bring in Neymar back to the club in 2020, but have been asked to sacrifice one of their brightest prospects in exchange.</h3>
      <p>Paris Saint-Germain winger Neymar has failed to live up to the 222 million euros’ price tag that his club spent on signing him from Barcelona two summers ago. The Brazil international has been constantly surrounded with off-field issues and been injured during the business end and crucial stage of the season when the Champions League comes to life.</p>
      <p>During this summer’s transfer window, Neymar tried to push himself out of the Parc des Princes and had offered himself to former club Barcelona as well as their arch rivals Real Madrid with a desperation of wanting to return back to Spain. Even though nothing fell through regarding the transfer, Neymar’s saga is expected to reopen in 2020.</p>
      <p>Nasser Al-Khelaifi, Paris Saint-Germain’s owner did take aim at Neymar recently when he said that he would not tolerate celebrity behavior at the club and is open to selling the winger. With the Catalans as well as the player wanting a reunion, <a href="https://www.diariogol.com/fcbarcelona/bomba-neymar-el-psg-lo-quiere-a-el-y-140-millones-y-no-es-griezmann-ni-dembele_20011226_102.html"><b>Diario GOL has reported</b></a> that PSG have proposed a deal that would see Neymar’s price in cash drop.</p>
      <p>Given that the Blaugrana are unwilling to offer 200 million euros for their former ace, the Ligue 1 champions want 140 million euros as cash payment while they have also asked for Barca youngster Ansu Fati in return. The 17 year old is valued at 40 million euros and has risen to the occasion at the Camp Nou, becoming a famous figure.</p>
      <p>Whether the defending La Liga champions will be ready to lose a future prospect remains to be seen, but it is clear that they need Neymar to return. Since the Brazilian’s departure, Barca’s left wing has never really looked potent after Coutinho and Dembele failed and neither did they manage to do too well in the UEFA Champions League.</p>
      <p>Do you think Neymar will return to Barcelona by the time 2020/21 kicks off?</p>
