      <p>Aerial pictures have revealed how thick smoke has blanketed the city of Sydney, masking its iconic landmarks in smog.</p>
      <p>People with medical conditions have been told to stay indoors by health experts as raging wildfires continue to burn nearby.</p>
      <p>Smoke from the out-of-control blazes covered the skyline, with air quality in some parts of the Australian city reaching over hazardous levels.</p>
      <p>Some five million people live in New South Wales, where 48 fires continue to burn and much of the state’s coastal areas are under very high fire danger.</p>
      <p>Six people have died in bush fires in the state’s north since October.</p>

      <p>He said firefighters attempting to end the wildfires will continue to be challenged by high temperatures and wind conditions.</p>
      <p>Fires have destroyed 577 homes in New South Wales during the wildfire season, which peaks during the southern hemisphere summer but has started early after an unusually warm and dry winter.</p>
      <p>Sydney residents were warned about severe fire danger on Tuesday, as temperatures soared to 37C in the city’s west.</p>
      <p>Parts of the city recorded air pollution levels at eight times higher than the national benchmark.</p>
      <p>The fire service said: ‘The smoke is likely to hang around for the next few days.’</p>
