      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jeff-goldblum">Jeff Goldblum</a> has just dropped a huge revelation about <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/RobertDowneyJr.">Robert Downey Jr</a>‘s involvement in a future <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/mcu-timeline-watch-order-marvel-cinematic-universe-every-film-movie-tv-show-avengers-endgame-thor-a9051996.html">Marvel</a> project.</p>
      <p>The actor, who played the Grandmaster in <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>, said the Iron Man actor will return for <i>What If...?,</i> a new animated series that re-imagines past Marvel films with alternate plot twists.</p>
      <p>Other <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/marvel">MCU</a> stars, including Chris Evans, Michael B Jordan and Hayley Atwell, will show up in the Disney+ series, but this is the first confirmation fans have had about Downey Jr’s appearance.</p>
      <p>What’s more is he will be appearing alongside the Grandmaster who, Goldblum has claimed, is being lined up for a role in Taika Waititi’s sequel <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/natalie-portman-marvel-films-thor-4-mcu-comiccon-phase-four-release-slate-love-and-thunder-trailer-a9014101.html"><i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i></a>.</p>
      <p>This is not the only Disney+ TV show Downey Jr is expected to show up in. Earlier this year, sources reported he would <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/marvel-robert-downey-jr-iron-man-ironheart-avengers-endgame-disney-plus-mcu-a9091056.html">return to the fold</a> in a series based on <i>Ironheart</i>, the teenage genius who continues Tony Stark’s legacy in the comic books.</p>
      <p>It has been claimed the actor will return in a voiceover role similar to Paul Bettany’s JARVIS.</p>
      <p>This would follow what is expected to be a cameo role in <i>Black Widow</i>, the <i>Avengers: Infinity Wa</i>r prequel starring Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh and David Harbour.</p>
      <p>Other Marvel reports to have surfaced this year include one that stated <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/marvel-avengers-endgame-x-men-wolverine-mcu-hugh-jackman-fantastic-four-disney-a9055231.html">Wolverine would be joining the MCU</a> in post-credits scenes ahead of the X-Men’s official introduction in Phase Five.</p>
      <p>During an <i>Empire</i> Q&amp;A in August, Marvel president Kevin Feige detailed a scrapped <i>Avengers: Endgame </i>scene that would have been <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/avengers-endgame-deleted-scene-marvel-thanos-captain-america-mcu-kevin-feige-a9049141.html">extremely traumatic for kids</a> and also recently revealed <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/avengers-endgame-marvel-scarlet-witch-thanos-elizabeth-olsen-mcu-kevin-feige-wandavision-doctor-a9036616.html">which Avenger could have single-handedly taken down Thanos</a> if he had had no back up from his army. </p>
      <p><i>Black Widow</i> is released on 1 May, 2020. <i>What If...?</i> will be released in 2021.</p>
