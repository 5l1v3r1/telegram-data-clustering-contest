      <p>WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Tuesday any moves to question the collective defense guarantee included in the NATO treaty were a threat to the future of the European Union and the military alliance.</p>
      <p>Speaking in parliament following the Oct. 13 parliamentary election that handed a new term in office to the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, Morawiecki also said the EU should continue to work closely with Britain after it leaves the bloc.</p>
      <p>French President Emmanuel Macron told The Economist earlier this month that NATO was experiencing “brain death”, citing a lack of coordination and U.S. unpredictability under President Donald Trump.</p>
