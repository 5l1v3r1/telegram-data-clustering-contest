      <p>The officers of the Education Department in Hassan are making efforts to retain the top position in SSLC results in the current academic year. A team of senior officers of the department have been assigned schools, where the result was poor last year, to ensure an improvement this year.</p>
      <p>In the academic year 2018-19, Hassan secured the top position in the State with the pass percentage of 89.75. Now the officers have the task of retaining the same position this year too. In the current year, 21,422 students will appear for the examination.</p>
      <p>K.S. Prakash, Deputy Director of Public Instructions, told presspersons that the officers were giving attention to schools and places where the result was low. Senior officers have adopted schools with poor performance. Each officer has been assigned a couple of such schools. “The officer has to visit the school he has been assigned to and take steps to improve the results”, he said.</p>
      <p>Last year, the schools conducted parents’ meeting regularly to ensure students study at home without fail. Students’ mothers took extra care to attend the meetings and support their children in achieving good results. The same exercise is being followed this year too, the officer said. The question paper pattern has been revised this year. The department has conducted exercises to familiarise students with the new pattern.</p>
      <p>“All teachers and officers are working towards retaining the top position in the results. I am hopeful that we will succeed in our efforts”, said Mr. Prakash.</p>
