      <p>The Young Men’s Christian Association of Honolulu has agreed to put in $1.7 million in improvements at Kamamalu Neighborhood Park, the city facility next to the YMCA’s busy Nuuanu branch.</p>
      <p>The improvements include a new comfort station, a new 150-stall parking lot, expansion and re-striping of the park’s existing parking lot, new security lighting and improved landscaping.</p>
      <p>Under a new city ordinance, park-goers will need to feed meters to park. The city said that’s to deter downtown workers or others from parking there.</p>
      <p>The city has put up a play apparatus set at a cost of $118,000.</p>
      <p>Under the public-private partnership, the YMCA will conduct basic maintenance of the comfort station and conduct volunteer cleanup efforts of the park. The city will continue to do regular maintenance.</p>
      <p>The agreement was formally announced by Mayor Kirk Caldwell, YMCA CEO and president Michael Broderick and other YMCA officials at a press conference held at the park today.</p>
