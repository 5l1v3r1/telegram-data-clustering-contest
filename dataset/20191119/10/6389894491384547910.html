      <p>In a trading update, the company said earnings for the year were estimated at between £136m and £142m, due to weaker higher margin UK corporate activity.</p>
      <p>The company also said that its expectations for revenue would be at the upper end of its guidance of £550m to £567m.</p>
      <p>Shares initially slumped 22 per cent before creeping back. They remained 11 per cent down at 10:30 am.</p>
      <p>Despite the change in guidance, Equiniti said that the company’s performance had been reassuring.</p>
      <p>It said that client retention remained strong across the group, and that it had secure new customers across all of its divisions.</p>
      <p>Equiniti’s investment solutions division has continued to take market share, with new wins including Marshall and Vitec Group.</p>
      <p>Growth in the intelligence solutions business was driven by a combination of remediation services and software sales.</p>

      <p>After completing the separation of the US division in the first half of 2019, the company added that there would be no more non-operating charges in the second half of the year.</p>
      <p>In a statement the company said:</p>
      <p>“Whilst we expect the uncertainty in the macro environment to continue, Equiniti remains well positioned.</p>
      <p>“We expect further organic growth in the UK as we build on our relationships with our exceptional client base.</p>
      <p>“The US offers a platform for accelerated growth based on market opportunity, the potential to take market share and the opportunity to cross-sell digitised services into our blue-chip client base.” </p>
