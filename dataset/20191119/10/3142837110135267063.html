      <p>Equities Research Analysts’ updated eps estimates for Tuesday, November 19th:</p>
      <p>Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ:ALGT) had its buy rating reissued by analysts at Buckingham Research. They currently have a $219.00 price target on the stock, up from their previous price target of $206.00.</p>
      <p>Beigene (NASDAQ:BGNE) was downgraded by analysts at UBS Group AG from a buy rating to a neutral rating.</p>
      <p>Charles River Laboratories Intl. (NYSE:CRL) had its buy rating reissued by analysts at Argus. The firm currently has a $170.00 price target on the stock.</p>
      <p>Dicerna Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:DRNA) had its outperform rating reiterated by analysts at Leerink Swann. They currently have a $30.00 target price on the stock, up from their previous target price of $26.00.</p>
      <p>Ford Motor (NYSE:F) had its outperform rating reissued by analysts at Credit Suisse Group AG.</p>
      <p>Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) had its neutral rating reaffirmed by analysts at Royal Bank of Canada. The firm currently has a $109.00 target price on the stock.</p>
      <p>International Game Technology (NYSE:IGT) had its buy rating reissued by analysts at Deutsche Bank AG. The firm currently has a $21.00 target price on the stock.</p>
      <p>MAG Silver (TSE:MAG) (NYSEAMERICAN:MAG) had its outperform rating reiterated by analysts at BMO Capital Markets. The firm currently has a C$17.50 target price on the stock. We view the JV approval of Juanicipio as positive. In our view, the approval will likely not surprise many given the large amount of underground development that has already taken place, but it should remove any doubt that may have still been in the market. The slightly higher capex figure versus the 2017 PEA is in line with our prior assumptions and well telegraphed by MAG. Average annual production of 11.7Moz silver was a bit light versus our prior estimates but is still robust. We view the JV approval of Juanicipio as positive.
