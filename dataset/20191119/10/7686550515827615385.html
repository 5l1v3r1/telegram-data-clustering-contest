      <h2>Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and Asda are following in Morrison's footsteps by banning black plastic.</h2>

      <p>Four leading supermarkets are trying to do their bit for the environment and will stop using black plastic in stores by the end of 2019, according to a report by The Grocer.</p>
      <p>Morrisons was the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/morrisons-becomes-first-supermarket-scrap-17238752">first supermarket to scrap black plastic packaging</a> , as it is difficult to recycle and usually ends up in landfill. Black plastic also contains a carbon pigment that makes it hard for the recycling machines to detect, meaning it's often improperly sorted.</p>
      <p>Black plastic is usually found in food packaging, such as sausage and ready meal trays.</p>

      <p>Iceland and Aldi are also working on their eco-friendly business plan and intend to ditch plastic packaging in their stores by the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>Tesco also said it's working with branded suppliers about the plastic problem to see if they're willing to use more eco-friendly packaging.</p>
      <p>Asda has already placed the trays on their ready meals to make them 100% recyclable, swapping the plastic trays on their Extra Special Aberdeen Angus steaks for recyclable cardboard trays, which will save more that 50 tonnes of plastic each year.</p>
      <p>Co-op is also confident about removing the black packaging by the end of the year, hoping to eradicate it from all 300 lines.</p>
      <p>By the end of December, Sainsbury's also aim to completely eradicate the packaging from stores and more than 6000 tonnes of plastic material will be swapped for recyclable alternatives.</p>
      <p>Waitrose said they're on track to eradicate black plastic packaging by the new year as they had removed nearly 90% of the 2291 tonnes of black packaging the chain uses by the end of October.</p>
      <p>Stuart Lendrum, head of recycling at Iceland said: "we have been making good progress with eliminating black plastic across the board," hoping to remove black plastic packaging in stores by the end of January 2020.</p>
      <p>Marks &amp; Spencer and Aldi are further behind on their sustainability targets, but both said they're on track to remove black plastic by the end of 2020.</p>
