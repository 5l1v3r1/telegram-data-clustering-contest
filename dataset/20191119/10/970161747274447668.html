      <p>A convicted paedophile is being hunted by police after he went on the run following his release from jail.</p>
      <p>Cops have urged members of the public not to approach Valerijs Gordijs, 46, who was released from HMP Hull yesterday.</p>
      <p>An arrest warrant was issued hours after he was released from prison, where he was serving a sentence for sexual offences against children.</p>
      <p>Humberside Police said officers have carried out inquiries since his release but could not locate Gordijs.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the force said: ‘Officers are currently making enquiries to locate Valerijs Gordijs following a warrant issued for his arrest.</p>
      <p>‘Gordijs, 46, was released from HMP Hull on Monday, 18 November, where he was serving a sentence for sexual offences against children.</p>
      <p>‘Officers have carried out various enquiries since the prison reported his release and a warrant has now been issued for his arrest to return him to prison.</p>
      <p>‘If you believe you know where he is, please call police on 101. If you see him, please do not approach him. In an emergency, always call 999.’</p>
