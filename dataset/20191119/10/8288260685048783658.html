      <h1>'One of us!' - Birmingham City fans give their verdict on Blues starlet Jude Bellingham</h1>
      <h2>Latest Birmingham City news | The talented Blues midfielder made his first-team debut at 16 years of age earlier this season, and appears to have a bright future ahead</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:36:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:36</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Birmingham City are beginning to showcase their abilities in the Sky Bet Championship this season.</p>
      <p>One of the players who has got Blues fans excited is young midfielder <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jude-bellingham">Jude Bellingham</a> .</p>
      <p>The 16-year-old broke onto the scene at the start of the campaign, making his first-team debut in the 3-0 defeat to Portsmouth in the Carabao Cup first round tie in August.</p>
      <p>He has since gone on to make 12 appearances in the Championship, eight of which have come as a starter, and looks to have a bright future ahead of him.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Bellingham netted his first professional goal in Blues’ 2-1 win over Stoke City in August, and followed that up with another strike in their following game against Charlton Athletic.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, we asked Blues fans to describe the talented midfielder in just three words.</p>
      <p>Here is a selection of what they had to say.</p>
