Rarey tried to force his way out of the hold, biting his brother multiple times before he passed out, according to police.</p>
      <p>Police said Rarey told officers he would kill his brother if he filed charges because that would automatically eliminate his chances of trying out for "America's Got Talent."</p>
      <p>He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.</p>
