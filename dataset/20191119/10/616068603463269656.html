      <p>A woman has been sentenced to 15 days in federal custody for throwing a sports drink at a Florida congressman who frequently appears on television supporting President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Federal court records show that 35-year-old Amanda Kondrat'yev was sentenced last Monday in Pensacola. Her confinement is scheduled to begin Dec. 2.</p>
      <p>Kondrat'yev pleaded guilty to assault in August. She had faced up to a year in prison.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Kondrat'yev was part of a group protesting in June outside a town hall meeting attended by U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz.</p>
      <p>The second-term Republican was leaving a coffee house when a cup struck him in the back. Several witnesses identified Kondrat'yev as the assailant, and the throw was caught on video.</p>
