      <h2>RJ Balaji will talk about "the pressing issues that we come across in daily lives in a positive way."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:35:39+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/s-subhakeerthana/" target="_blank">S Subhakeerthana</a></address>
      <p>RJ Balaji, who recently turned director with <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/nayanthara/">Nayanthara</a>’s Mookuthi Amman, will host a podcast titled ‘Mind Voice’, starting tomorrow. According to a source, “Balaji is expected to discuss a wide array of topics pertaining to serious stuff happening around us.”</p>
      <p>At the press meet, Balaji said, “Today’s generation faces so much frustration and negativity from different things. I will talk about the pressing issues that we come across in daily lives in a positive way.”</p>
      <p>Besides, he thanked Aditya Kashyap, Vice President Marketing, Jio Saavn, for having offered him an effective platform to communicate with the audience. “We are warming up to podcasts in vernacular languages. The engagement and loyalty of the listener is much higher in this case, as they feel like being a part of the conversation,” he added.</p>

      <p>Balaji understands the importance of what to and what not to speak. “During my initial days as an RJ, I did a show called ‘Cross Talk’ which had a good reach. Eventually, at some point in time, I started keeping an eye out on things I shouldn’t discuss. I realised many kids were listening to it. Likewise, I will be careful, and apply the same rule here,” Balaji assured .</p>
      <p>On the film front, Balaji is occupied with the pre-production work of Mookuthi Amman. Multiple reports suggest that he will share screen space with Nayanthara. While confirmation is awaited on the same, we know the whole crew is planning to turn vegetarian until they complete the shooting. “Mookuthi Amman will be a spiritual film, but has a relevant message to society,” Balaji said, hoping Nayanthara’s presence will lead to maximum reach.</p>
      <p>Produced by Ishari K Ganesh, Mookuthi Amman, co-directed by NJ Saravanan, is expected to hit the screens early next year.</p>
      <p>(Mind Voice will stream on JioSaavn every Wednesday)</p>
