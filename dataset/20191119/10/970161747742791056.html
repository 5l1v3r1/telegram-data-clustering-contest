      <p>When a bar has a lengthy cocktail menu, it can be hard to choose what you want.</p>
      <p>Either you go rogue and end up with something that’s really not to your taste or stick to an old favourite and never get to try anything new.</p>
      <p>Well, good news. Gin brand, Tanqueray is taking over a townhouse to create a pop-up bar where they use all sorts of things to help you choose your drink.</p>
      <p>There are five rooms to choose from – from an elegant lounge bar to a secret bar, where they’ll analyse your senses to create personalised drinks.</p>
      <p>The event will run from 6-14 December at Bloomsbury House in London.</p>
      <p>Tickets cost £12 but they include two cocktails and access to the whole experience.</p>

      <p>Guests will be greeted with a gin (Tanqueray of course) and tonic on arrival as they move through each of the rooms.</p>

      <p>Magic Circle artists will also be performing illusions throughout so expect playing cards magically appearing in gin bottles and cocktail shakers disappearing in front of your eyes.</p>
      <p>At The Lounge Bar, you can get classic G&amp;Ts, gin-based classic cocktails like a Tom Collins and new recipes created by Jack Sotti, like a Townhouse Negroni and a Bloomsbury Sour.</p>
      <p>For those looking for a relaxed vibe, there’s a library featuring a whole range of books about gin.</p>
      <p>There’s also The Gifting Room, where you can create Christmas gifts. There’s a calligrapher’s table where you can create customised labels, wax bottle seals and your own wrapping paper for the gin-lover in your life. This is the only bit of the experience open to non-ticket holders so if you miss out on a ticket, you can still take a look.</p>
      <p>Things get a little more scientific with The Aura Room, where they apparently use facial recognition technology to read your aura and decide which cocktail is for you.</p>
      <p>And the final room is The Secret Bar. A selection of lucky guests will be invited via a ringing telephone to take part. They will then be given a range of scented vials of Tanqueray No. Ten ingredients and gin experts will assess the reaction to create a unique cocktail based on the results. We’re not sure how accurate it can really be but it sounds like fun.</p>

      <p>The whole event will raise money for The Felix Project, a charity that helps people experiencing food poverty in London.</p>
      <p>Tickets <a href="http://www.tanqueraytownhouse.com/">are on sale now</a> so grab one before they’re gone.</p>
