        <i>Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!</i>
      </p>
      <p>Fitbit has always been a ‘cool’ thing to have. People gift Fitbit bands to friends and family so they can start ‘working out.’ Or at least spend a few days harping about the importance of health and try to beat the daily goal of 10,000 steps.</p>
      <p>I’ve seen people walking up and down in their houses to complete that goal, and even tie their bands to their dog’s collar to do that. But now, <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/11/01/its-official-google-is-buying-fitbit-for-2-1-billion/">Google has acquired Fitbit</a>. So, Google might tell you to walk more with its Google Fit platform – which can be cool or worrying.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, it’s never too late to start working out. Especially when the Fitbit Versa 2 is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TWFWJDZ">selling for just $150</a>, instead of $200.</p>
      <p>The Versa 2 has an in-built heart rate sensor so you can track your workouts accurately. It also has the capability to record your sleep and swimming sessions.</p>
      <p>The fitness band can store over 300 songs, so you don’t have to carry your phone around while exercising. Plus, it’s also compatible with Amazon Alexa – that helps you control the watch functions without touching it with your sweaty hands.</p>
      <p>The company claims you can use the band for more than six days with a single charge.</p>
      <p>Sitting around will not make you healthy. Get the new Fitbit Versa 2 for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TWFWJDZ">just $150 ($50 off)</a>.</p>
