      <p>Conspiracy theorists are branding teenage climate activist <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/greta-thunberg/">Greta Thunberg</a> a time traveller after spotting her in a 120-year-old picture.</p>
      <p>The picture in question shows three children working at a gold mine in the Yukon Territory in Canada and was taken around 1898. It was found in the picture archives of the Univeristy of Washington, which <a href="https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu/digital/collection/hegg/id/601">you can see for yourself here</a>.</p>
      <p>While it’s true that one of the children does bear a striking resemblance to Greta, we have to point out the teenage activist has not, in fact, discovered the art of time travel.</p>
      <p>It’s pretty much just a spooky coincidence.</p>
      <p>But the internet hasn’t wasted any time in pointing out the similarity.</p>

      <p>Greta is currently leading the charge on climate change and is travelling to events to raise awareness – all without resorting to flying on a plane.</p>
      <p>She travelled by boat from Europe to the USA earlier this year and was planning to go to a crucial environmental conference in Chile.</p>
      <p>However, the event was moved to Madrid, Spain, at late notice following widespread protests and violence in the South American country – leaving Greta stranded ahead of a possible 6,000 mile journey.</p>

      <p>Not one to be deterred, she is currently crossing the Atlantic back again to try and make it back to Europe without having to set foot on a plane.</p>

      <p>At just 16, Greta has single-handedly inspired a generation to demand action on climate change, sparking important conversations on some of the world’s biggest platforms.</p>
      <p>A year ago, she walked out of school on her own and warned her parents and teachers she would not go back into lessons until adults began working to end the climate crisis.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, she was joined by millions of people from 150 countries across the globe <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/20/best-signs-climate-change-protests-around-world-10779947/">protesting the lack of action on climate change</a>.</p>
