      <p>A new dad was caught with hundreds of indecent images of children on his laptop.</p>
      <p>Graeme Rippey, 32, denied downloading photos depicting abuse of youngsters, but a jury unanimously found him guilty last Wednesday after trial at Hamilton Sheriff Court.</p>
      <p>He was also convicted of possessing images showing bestiality.</p>
      <p>Lorry driver Rippey was charged after an early morning police raid at his home in Ravenscliffe Road, Motherwell, on November 23 last year.</p>
      <p>The laptop had been given to him by his stepdad, who was called as a witness and denied all knowledge of the images.</p>
      <p>Rippey didn’t try to blame his stepdad, claiming the images must have been downloaded by accident. His partner wept as she recalled police arriving at their home with a search warrant.</p>
      <p>Asked her reaction to the discovery of indecent images, she told Vish Kathuria, prosecuting: “I had just given birth a few weeks before. I was quite shocked.”</p>
      <p>Ms Findlay said she and Rippey both had the laptop password, but said he used the device more often than she did.</p>
      <p>She too denied any knowledge of the indecent images.</p>
      <p>The witness agreed with solicitor-advocate Ali Murray, representing Rippey, that what had happened was “horrendous, embarrassing and upsetting”.</p>
      <p>She had never seen Rippey acting suspiciously with the laptop.</p>
      <p>The woman admitted that she stood to lose “everything” if Rippey was convicted, but insisted she would not lie to the court to protect her partner.</p>
      <p>After the guilty verdicts, Sheriff Alasdair MacFadyen called for background reports and ordered Rippey, now of Drumchapel, to return for sentence on December 23.</p>
