      <p>Based on the new 208 road car, which comes with the latest advanced technology, and confirming to the FIA’s renamed Rally 4 (R4) rules, the 208 Rally 4 will be eligible for the FIA European Rally Championship and available from the second quarter of 2020, although Llarena and co-driver Sara Fernández will put the car through its paces on this weekend’s Rally Comunidad de Madrid RACE.</p>
      <p>The car is the culmination of a design, test and development phase dating back to the summer of 2018. It features a three-cylinder turbocharged, 1.2-litre engine using the latest PureTech technology, Magneti Marelli engine management system and SADEV gearbox.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the completion of the FIA homologation process at the end of the first quarter of 2020, Peugeot Sport will take pre-orders at the beginning of January 2020 with the car costing €66,000 plus tax. The initial production will be earmarked for one-make competitions in France and Spain.</p>
      <p><b>Did you know? </b>More than 450 examples of the Peugeot 208 R2 were sold worldwide.</p>
