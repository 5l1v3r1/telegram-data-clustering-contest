      <p>On the go-home episode of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/raw">Monday Night RAW</a> before <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">WWE Survivor Series</a>, majority of the NXT Superstars showed up and took down the performers of the main roster. This was obviously done by the Black and Gold brand to showcase that they possess the upper hand heading into Sunday's event.</p>
      <h3>NXT Invasions</h3>
      <p>The invasion started with the first match of the night where NXT Women's Champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/shayna-baszler">Shayna Baszler</a>, Marina Shafir and Jessamyn Duke attacked The IIconics, Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynch.</p>
      <p>The second invasion took place during the battle between Kevin Owens and Drew McIntyre and it was led by the WWE CEO and NXT supremo, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/triple-h">Triple H</a> himself. Dominik Dijakovic, Damien Priest, The Forgotten Sons, The Undisputed Era and several other reputed members of the NXT roster made their presence felt and decimated the former WWE Universal Champion.</p>
      <p>RAW Tag Team Championship match between The Viking Raiders and the team of Ricochet and Randy Orton also got disrupted owing to another invasion from SmackDown and NXT. Tommaso Ciampa, Matt Riddle, Keith Lee, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/pete-dunne">Pete Dunne</a>, Isaiah Scott, Lio Rush, and other top-tier performers of the Black and Gold brand laid out RAW and SmackDown and for the night, established their dominance over the main rosters of the company.</p>
      <h3>NXT Superstars react</h3>
      <p>Following their successful conquest, several NXT performers took to Twitter to react to the invasion. Most of them also pointed out how NXT is the new 'A brand' and that they would win the brand wars at the upcoming WWE Survivor Series pay-per-view.</p>
      <p>NXT Women's Champion Shayna Baszler, The Forgotten Sons, Isaiah "Swerve" Scott, NXT Cruiserweight Champion Lio Rush are in the list of Superstars who commented on their appearance on tonight's RAW.</p>
