          </p>
          <p>For each of Leeward Islands and Combined Colleges and Campuses, today’s match couldn’t have carried bigger ramifications. Slumping in form, both the sides are on a downward and wayward spiral as things stand, making the need to snap out of their losing spree an imminent and requite one.</p>
          <p>After beginning the Super50  Cup in exemplary fashion with three successive wins, Leeward Islands have gone onto lose two matches in successions to not only slip from challenging from first place in Group A but also allow their counterparts to snap at their heels. The side were made a mockery of in their foregone contest, trounced by 9 wickets by Barbados who needed a mere 31 overs to get past the 185 run target set out infront of them.</p>

                <p>And as the side enter the fray of today’s clash, they’ll be delighted at the identity of their opponents. In Combined Colleges and Campuses, they are going at loggerheads against the bottom placed side, a team which has been left beleaguered with horrid displays to emerge with the singular win from five matches.</p>
                <p>The side come into this forthcoming encounter in sordid form, having registered the three defeats in succession with the most recent being a low scoring clash against Barbados. Despite the best efforts of their bowlers to take the match down to its closing stages, the 207 runs doled out by their bats were never going to be enough to mount a challenge, seeing the side be put down by 4 wickets at the end of the day.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>A travesty of a track for the batters, this is a track where the batsmen are going to endure a tepid time. The exodus of batsmen is going to be extremely quick and high in the first part of the match with the conditions massively favouring the pacers who’ll get the ball to frisk around, leading the side winning the toss opting to field first in this low scorer.</p>

                            <h3>LEI vs CCC Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>The 194 runs he’s strung together in 5 matches for Leeward Islands include the one 100 and 50 apiece by <b>Devon Thomas</b> to see us make the side’s wicket-keeper an instant selection for today’s contest. We have<b> Romaine Morrison</b> from the opposition represent us as well in this facet given the 142 runs he’s managed to maraud his way to till now.</p>
                            <h3>LEI vs CCC Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>At a time when nothing was going his sides way in their batting travails, <b>Kieran Powell</b> showed fortitude, vigour and gustiness to hold fort from one end and canter his way to an extremely well made 88. It was a knock filled with patience and application, seeing him garner up the 327 runs in 5 encounters to emerge as the leading run getter for the side.</p>
                            <p><b>Montcin Hodge</b> is also selected by us from Leeward Islands alongside<b> Akeem Saunders</b> as we opt for an entire trivalent of batting picks from the side for this one giving the paper thin batting unit of their opponents.</p>
                            <h3>LEI vs CCC Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Just the one pick for us in the department of our Dream 11 unit with <b>Terrence Warde</b> forming our docket. The Leeward Islands all-rounder is someone who comes imbued with an innate ability to encapsulate his traits with both the bat and ball in tandem and put in pivotal performances on a constant basis to see us earmark him for this clash.</p>
                            <h3>LEI vs CCC Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>The most heavily packed component of our Dream 11 side, we have indulged in the five players over here not only owing to the dwindling nature of both the batting units but also the inclement nature of the surface at our disposal today. Wickets will fall at regular intervals today, making the bowlers from either side extremely good value for this encounter with us beginning with <b>Akeem Jordan</b>.</p>
                            <p>If Combined Campuses and Colleges are to have any chance of salvaging a win from this and emerging unscathed, they’ll require their spearhead to emulate the same rampant performance which has seen him amass 12 wickets in 5 matches. <b>Akshay Persaud</b> will partner him up for the day more so due to his reslliance and perseverance with the bat which has seen him pick up 137 runs this edition of the tournamnet.</p>
                            <p><b>Larry Joseph</b> completes the picks from the side while from the other side we are moving in with <b>Sheeno Berridge</b>, their leading wicket taker with the 13 wickets and <b>Jason Campbell</b> who has snagged 6 wickets.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Powell will represent our side as the captain for the day while Berridge from the same side being our vice-captain.</p>
