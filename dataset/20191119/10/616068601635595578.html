      <p>The City of Enderby is running a recruiting campaign for the Citizens on Patrol program, looking for volunteers to make a positive impact in the community.</p>
      <p>Citizens on Patrol will be used to spot crime or suspicious activity in the area.</p>
      <p>"We are now entering the third year of our re-launched Citizens on Patrol program, aimed at providing another tool to help deter and prevent crime in our community," says Mayor Greg McCune. "Local volunteers are the foundation of this program, and we are looking to build our roster."</p>
      <p>The volunteers will act as the "eyes and ears" in the community, and will be patrolling in marked vehicles. The patrol will notify the police of any suspicious activity that they observe.</p>
      <p>For those who wish to participate, the application can be found here. Applications will be accepted until Dec 20, and all volunteers must consent to a Police Information Check and other background verification.</p>
