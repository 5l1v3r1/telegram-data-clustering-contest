        <b>Tottenham reportedly have a four-man shortlist to replace under-pressure manager Mauricio Pochettino in north London.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Firstly, Spurs are said to be considering a move for RB Leipzig’s highly-rated coach Julian Nagelsmann <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/man-utd-have-30-million-reasons-why-they-want-tottenham-to-sack-pochettino"><b>if Pochettino does indeed receive the axe</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth’s Eddie Howe and current Napoli boss Carlo Ancelotti are also reported to be on chairman Daniel Levy’s shortlist.</p>
      <p>Despite guiding Spurs to their first Champions League final last season, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/mauricio-pochettino"><b>Pochettino</b></a> has been under pressure after a poor start to the season from his underperforming side.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old has overseen a woeful run of just 25 points from the last 24 matches and they currently sit 14th in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>There are also rumours of a rift with Levy <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/pochettino-has-major-beef-with-tottenham-over-failure-to-sign-barcelona-star"><b>over a lack of transfer activity</b></a> over the summer, with the Argentine wanting to rebuild a squad that will lose several key stars for nothing next summer.</p>
      <p>It is reported that the only thing stopping Levy from sacking Pochettino after over five years in charge is the £12.5million payout he’ll have to fork out in compensation.</p>

      <p>But according to <i>The Times</i>, a contingency plan is already in place and at the top of their shortlist is the highly-rated Nagelsmann.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old German worked wonders with Hoffenheim before taking over as Leipzig coach, where they currently sit second in the Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>Ancelotti, meanwhile, boasts an incredible CV and enjoyed a successful spell at Chelsea during which time he won the Premier League and FA Cup.</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho is also believed to be one of the candidates on the shortlist, having remained without a job since leaving Manchester United almost a year ago, and is thought to be holding out for the north London job.</p>
