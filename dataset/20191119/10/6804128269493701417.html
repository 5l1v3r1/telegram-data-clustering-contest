      <h1>Charlton's Deji Oshilaja: 'There was a lot of gang violence but football was my way out'</h1>
      <h2>Exclusive interview: The Addicks defender explains why he wants to mentor young people in inner-city areas and how footballers can do more to help their communities</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:04:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:04</time> by <a rel="author">Alan Smith</a></address>
      <p>Friday evening on an all-weather pitch at a school in Erith and Deji Oshilaja is in the mood for reflection. It is Kicks night at the Harris Garrard Academy, where about 30 local children are playing a high-quality game and, more importantly, staying away from trouble.</p>
      <p>The Charlton Athletic defender was a regular at events like these growing up in Bermondsey, turning up at games run by Millwall at The Den’s community space.</p>
      <p>His memories are fond but carry a warning. In a city where 125 people have already been killed in 2019, the need for such initiatives has never been greater.</p>
      <p>Without them Oshilaja, and countless other talented young players, would have struggled to stay out of trouble.</p>
      <p>Too many teenagers who feel they have no prospects are too easily lured towards the easy money and respect offered by gang culture.</p>
      <p>But these community events run by the city’s football clubs offer some hope and direction.</p>
      <p>Although an hour of football cannot ensure that these young people will not be dragged in, it is one of few opportunities where their safety, save for a late tackle, can be guaranteed.</p>
      <p>“Growing up in south-east London, inner-city London, is tough,” Oshilaja says. “You have to be tough. I grew up on the Old Kent Road and there was a lot of gang violence there but football was the way out for me and it definitely kept me away from that, kept me on the straight and narrow.</p>

      <p>“I met other good players [at Kicks events] and the coaching staff told me I had talent and could go places. You tend to focus on that more instead of going down different routes, staying out of school and doing nonsense on the road.</p>
      <p>“You come to these schemes, work on your skills and try to become a better player instead. You meet people as well – friends that you can go to their houses and do different things.”</p>
      <p>It is also why when the 26-year-old speaks to this group before presenting two players with new boots he discusses why he wants to become a mentor for young people who need some guidance.</p>
      <p>He plans to have a wider conversation with Charlton’s community trust to figure out which avenues he can go down to help kids in the club’s catchment area and believes that footballers can “definitely” do more to inspire and help the next generation.</p>
      <p>When Charlton went to The Den the weekend before last, losing a predictably tasty encounter 2-1, Oshilaja walked home from the ground to his mum’s house. She still lives near the Old Kent Road and when he passes by he often sees kids on the street and feels compelled to stop and chat.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got a lot of young boys in the area now that I speak to,” he says. “When I see them out on the road now sometimes, I tell them they could be doing different things. There are different routes to go down. A lot of them seem to listen and that’s a positive thing.</p>
      <p>“I don’t feel pressured to do it but the older you get the more you realise you’re a role model to kids coming through. It’s more of a thing of getting into the mindset of helping to straighten someone out, help them to realise their potential.</p>
      <p>“If I can help as many people as I can, I’ll be happy. A lot of kids can relate to my background so obviously I can have that impact on them.”</p>
      <p>As Oshilaja speaks a ball lands beside him and for a split second he reacts as if it might be something he needs to head clear. Instead it bounces before he passes it back to the kids eagerly waiting to restart their game.</p>
      <p>Again he is reminded of his own childhood and playing on the same team as Drew Spence, the Chelsea women’s midfield player who he insists was tougher than any of the boys.</p>
      <p>South London is an indelible part of his identity. The streets and courts around Bermondsey are where he learnt his trade, not joining a professional club until Cardiff City signed him when he was 17 years old.</p>
      <p>During his time at the south Wales club there were loans to Newport County, Sheffield Wednesday and, for a long spell, Gillingham but south London was calling him back. He had a temporary stint at Wimbledon in 2015 but joined the League One side permanently in 2017 and was their captain last season before being released.</p>
      <p>He had a trial Luton Town in the summer as well but Lee Bowyer, the Charlton manager, was keen on a free agent who could offer an additional option at the back.</p>

      <p>Bowyer’s team started the campaign strongly but have taken just a point from their past four games – losing by a single goal to Bristol City, Preston and Millwall. They sit six points off the play-offs but, crucially, nine above relegation ahead of Cardiff’s visit on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“We’re in a decent position in the table but from our performances we feel we could have got a few more points,” Oshilaja adds.</p>
      <p>When, during one break in play, one young man asks Oshilaja how high up the table the Addicks can finish he says that they must not get too far ahead of themselves. Staying in the division is the first goal, after that they will begin to look upwards.</p>
      <p>The young man does not appear satisfied with merely staying in the Championship and opines that he is convinced Charlton are good enough to return to the Premier League for the first time since 2006-07.</p>
      <p>With a big smile, Oshilaja replies: “I like you, man. I like your positivity.”</p>
      <p>He is also on a steep learning curve. He may have come up against Harry Kane when Wimbledon faced Tottenham in the FA Cup two years ago (his toughest opponent, unsurprisingly; the strongest is Adebayo Akinfenwa) but he has not faced such high quality week-in week-out before.</p>
      <p>Growing up playing street football and attending Kicks events have shaped him as a player and offers proof that you do not need an academy background to succeed as a professional.</p>
      <p>“It definitely helped me,” he says. “Little things like how to manoeuvre the ball. I didn’t go to an academy until I was 17 and I did things differently to the other players that were there so maybe that helped me get a contract.”</p>
