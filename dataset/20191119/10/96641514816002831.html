      <h1>Vizio is updating SmartCast TVs to stream Disney+ via Chromecast</h1>
      <h2>The update should roll out in early December.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:14:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/christine-fisher" target="_blank">Christine Fisher</a></address>
      <p>Vizio is promising Android users that they'll be able to beam Disney+ to their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/13/vizio-smartcast-tv-alexa-voice-control/">SmartCast TVs</a> by the end of the year. Currently, iOS users can cast the Disney+ app to the TV <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/07/vizio-smartcast-airplay-assistant-alexa/">using AirPlay 2</a>. But Android users were left in the dark. Now, Vizio says it will roll out a Chromecast update beginning in early December. That will allow Android users to cast the Disney+ app to their Vizio SmartCast TVs via the built-in Chromecast.</p>
      <p>Vizio is working to make the SmartCast TVs more appealing ahead of the holidays. The update will benefit iOS users as well -- iOS streaming apps typically work with Chromecast too, so if you prefer it, you should be able to choose between that and AirPlay 2 when the update arrives.</p>
      <p>Vizio says its ability to roll out an over-the-air Chromecast update proves that its TVs can last for years. "We want consumers to know that when they purchase a VIZIO TV, it will keep its value for years to come," said Chief Technology Officer Bill Baxter. Though, Netflix recently announced plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/08/netflix-dropping-support-samsung-smart-tvs/">discontinue support</a> for Vizio smart TVs more than four years old.</p>
