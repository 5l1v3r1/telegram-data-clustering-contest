The Sensex closed 186 points higher at 40,469.70 , while the Nifty ended the session above 11,900. Yes Bank, M&amp;M were among the biggest losers in the Sensex pack. Shares of<b> </b>telecom majors Bharti Airtel and Vodafone jumped on Tuesday morning after the two announced hike in tariffs from December 1. Vodafone Idea shares closed 35% higher at Rs 6.02 on BSE. Shares of Bharti Airtel gained more than 8% to hit the day’s high at Rs 439.25 on BSE. Both Airtel and Vodafone Idea on Monday said they will raise mobile services tariffs from the month of December 2019 to remain viable and recoup from financial stress. The telecom sector requires continuous capital investments to keep up with the fast changing technology cycles, Bharti Airtel said. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea tariff hikes come as the Indian telecom industry posted a record quarterly loss. Vodafone Idea posted a loss of Rs 50,921 crore for the July-September quarter, owing to provision for the Supreme Court’s ruling on payment of  AGR dues, even as ongoing brutal pricing war continued to hurt. The headline indices Sensex and Nifty opened higher on Tuesday morning, led by a rally in index heavyweights. The Sensex is up about 90 points to 40,375, while the Nifty is trading above the 11,900-mark. We bring to you LIVE updates.</p>
