      <p>He adds of the rumours that his time in the cape is finished: “I’m not going to sit quietly in the dark as all the stuff is going on. I’ve not given up the role.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot I have to give for Superman yet. A lot of storytelling to do. A lot of real, true depths to the honesty of the character I wasn’t to get into.</p>
      <p>“I want to reflect the comic books. That’s important to me. There’s a lot of justice to be done for Superman. The status is: You’ll see.”</p>

      <p>Cavill also talks about the harsh nickname he was given at boarding school, admitting kids used to call him Fat Cavill.</p>
      <p>He shares, “I was a chubby kid. I could’ve very well gone down the route of just accepting my lot in life and being like, ‘I guess I’m not going to do anything.’”</p>

      <p>Cavill says acting helped him feel more comfortable in front of others: “It actually helped me survive. Even the kids who were nasty to me at times and took pleasure in squashing me—when I finished a play, they’d say, ‘Wow, you’re really good.’ And I was like, ‘Okay, this is where I draw my strength from.’”</p>
