      <h2>Disney Plus has finally arrived, but a full global launch is not expected for months. Nevertheless, it's worth comparing to the established major players. How does it stack up to Now TV?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:10:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:10</time> by <a rel="author">Anyron Copeman</a></address>
      <p>The launch of Disney+ is a major statement of intent by the California conglomerate, providing a hub for all the content from its illustrious history. However, there are a number of existing streaming services that have provided an excellent service for a number of years, so Disney will have to work extra hard to tempt people to its platform. </p>
      <p>Disney Plus is also not officially available in the UK until <b>31 March 2020</b>, but there is a (complicated) way to get around it. Read <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-disney-plus-uk-3777628/">how to watch Disney Plus in the UK</a>.</p>
      <p>One of these is Now TV, which takes a slightly different approach to streaming content, focusing on flexibility. Here, we compare the two services to see which is best for you.</p>
      <h3>How much do they cost?</h3>
      <p>Disney+ is only currently available in five countries - the US, Canada, The Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand. In the States, a standalone subscription is $6.99 per month, while it can be bundled with Hulu and ESPN+ for $12.99. We're expecting similar pricing in the UK.</p>
      <p>A subsidiary of Sky, Now TV is available primarily in the UK. There's a huge variety of passes and bundles to choose from, across Entertainment, Sky Cinema, Sky Sports, Kids and US reality service Hayu. Depending on which you choose, these can be a one-off payment or rolling monthly subscription, which starts at £3.99 but can reach £33.99 if you want just Sky Sports. This is still cheaper than bundling it with TV or broadband, though. </p>
      <p>Check out the full range of options <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777819-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fentertainment%2Fdisney-plus-vs-now-tv-3777819%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nowtv.com%2Fshop-bundles">here</a>. </p>
      <p>You can still use the service across the EU, provided you have logged into an account with UK payment information in the last 30 days. Like Disney Plus, many of the packages you choose will offer a 7-day free trial. </p>
      <p>While both services offer student discounts, Now TV's are usually only for a limited time via <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777819-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fentertainment%2Fdisney-plus-vs-now-tv-3777819%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.myunidays.com%2FGB%2Fen-GB%2Fpartners%2Fnowtv%2Fview%2Fonline">UNiDAYs</a>.</p>

      <h3>What can I watch on Disney Plus and Now TV?</h3>
      <p>The beauty of Disney Plus is that all its content will be available for a flat fee. $6.99 a month will get you access to the its full library of excellent launch titles, with more to come. </p>
      <p>TV highlights include Star Wars original <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-the-mandalorian-uk-3777629/">The Mandalorian</a>, a new High School Musical series and the full collection of The Simpsons by virtue of Disney'. However, films are where the service really comes into its own at launch. Classic movies stretching back over 80 years are here, including Miracle on 34th Street, Mary Poppins and Home Alone. </p>
      <p>Celebrated animation such as The Lion King, Bambi and Peter Pan makes for a truly impressive catalogue of content. </p>
      <p>Now TV's movie selection is primarily thanks to Sky Cinema. Major films are often added to its lineup a few months after cinema release  Ironically, some of its highlights are Disney owned and will shift to Disney+ once leasing agreements come to an end.</p>
      <p>However, while Disney Plus is a lot of content tailored towards children, Now TV has a greater range of options for each member of the family. </p>
      <p>It's the place for horror fans with The Shining and Hitchcock's The Birds, while timeless classics such Gone with the Wind and Ben-Hur give a window on a bygone era for film.</p>
      <p>The Entertainment Pass is also your best route into HBO's content from the UK, with Sky Atlantic broadcasting the likes of Big Little Lies and True Detective. </p>
      <p>Although it's the most expensive pass available, access to Sky Sports will get you 128 live <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/internet/watch-premier-league-online-tv-abroad-3640389/">Premier League</a> games and all the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-f1-3618424/">F1</a>. It's also great to have the flexibility of day, week and month passes. </p>

      <h3>Will more stuff be added?</h3>
      <p>It has already been confirmed that new films and TV will be added to Disney+'s already plentiful lineup. 16 of the 23 MCU films to date are already streaming, and Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther and Avengers: Endgame will all be arriving in the next 6 months.</p>
      <p>The library on streaming services only tends to grow following launch, so we can expect plenty more original content to make its way onto Disney Plus too. </p>
      <p>We can say with certainty that new content will be available on Now TV, by virtue of its live coverage on Sky Sports. Besides that, Sky Cinema has a steady stream of new titles, often coming just a few months after being out in the cinemas. Sky Atlantic's close ties to HBO are unlikely be threatened by the launch of <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/entertainment/hbo-max-3699426/">HBO Max</a> in 2020, while much of the Kids content is Disney and so on borrowed time via Now TV.</p>
      <p>It has steadily expanded its lineup since initial launch in 2012. In particular, the Sky Cinema package has a steady stream of recent releases, while every live event on Sky Sports is technically new content. </p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>
      <p>Disney Plus and Now TV take very different approaches to streaming content. Many people will prefer the everything-under-one-roof approach of Disney, while others will enjoy the flexibility of shows and movies offered by Now TV. </p>
      <p>It's easy to forget how much content has been produced by Disney and its subsidiaries, so not all of it is tailored towards children. However, if you're looking for gritty dramas or chilling horror movies you should go with Now TV.</p>
      <p>We'd guess most people would prefer Disney+, but the option to dip in and out of Now TV means it remains a compelling option. </p>
