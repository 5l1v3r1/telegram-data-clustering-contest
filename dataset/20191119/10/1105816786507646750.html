      <h1>Twitter combats trolling with new feature</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:11:26+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/6748/tech-desk/" target="_blank">Tech Desk</a></address>
      <p>Online trolling has become an epidemic; with thousands of users joining social media every day, there is an inevitable rise to harassment.</p>
      <p>Twitter is countering this problem by launching one of the handiest features for its users that allow them to flag list posts and content they deem abusive.</p>
      <p>Recently, the social media giant was in the news when “I Hired Donald Trump To Fire People Like Yovanovitch” tweet went viral causing many accounts to get suspended.</p>

      <p>The company announced on Monday, that the new update is available on iOS and will now be on Android and the platform’s website.</p>
      <p>The feature will enable users to report a list, in the same manner, they reported an individual tweet, the option will be visible under the Menu, “Report” icon.</p>
      <p>“Once you’ve submitted your report, we’ll send you an email confirming receipt and provide recommendations for additional actions you can take to improve your Twitter experience,” Twitter wrote on its <i><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/report-abusive-behavior">help page</a></i>.</p>

      <p>Once an offending list has been reported it will be placed under the Twitter “Time-out” corner until it is deleted, according to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-report-trolls-lists-harassment/"><i>Mashable</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Earlier in 2017, the company tested on hiding list notification from users, however, this move received backlash as it made monitoring harassment more difficult.</p>

      <p>Before this change, users would individually report harassers or block list creators which would remove them from any offending list.</p>
      <p>Social media platforms face increasing pressure from regulators and users to tighten rules and against harassment and manipulating content.</p>
