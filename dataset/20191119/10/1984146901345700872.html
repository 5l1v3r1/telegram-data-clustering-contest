      <h1>Jack Ross insists Sunderland experience made him a better manager as he takes charge of Hibernian</h1>
      <h2>Ross signed a three-and-a-half year deal as Hibernian boss after being sacked by Sunderland last month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:37:49+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:37</time> by <a rel="author">Sean McCormick</a></address>
      <p>Jack Ross believes he has emerged from his time at Sunderland as a better manager as he gets to work as the new boss of Scottish Premiership side Hibernian.</p>
      <p>Ross was sacked as Black Cats boss in October after an indifferent start to their League One campaign. In his first season in charge, the 43-year-old guided Sunderland to two Wembley finals but failure to win promotion to the Championship proved fatal.</p>
      <p>The Scot arrived on Wearside having just managed in the Scottish Championship, but was looked upon as a promising young manager having guided St Mirren to promotion to the Scottish Championship.</p>
      <p>It was a new experience to go from managing in the second tier of Scottish football to managing an ex-Premier League club who were still getting around 30,000 fans at the Stadium of Light in League One.</p>
      <p>But despite how it ended, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Ross</a> insists he loved his <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> experience and now feels he heads to Edinburgh as a better manager.</p>
      <p>“It was relentless and intense,” he said during his unveiling as Hibs boss yesterday.</p>
      <p>“We had 61 games last season and travelled a lot so that intense nature of it was significantly different than what I was used to before.</p>
      <p>“But it’s impossible not to enjoy leading teams out at Wembley or being in charge of a team that’s getting 30,000 fans every other week.</p>
      <p>“There were ups and downs, highs and lows, but taking the opportunity to be Sunderland manager is something I will never regret. It was a terrific all-round experience.</p>
      <p>"I think it was a brilliant but hugely challenging job.</p>
      <p>"It is a fantastic football club with big expectations and as a coach l learned to work with players who had played at various levels of the game and then how to manage the expectations of a huge fan-base.</p>
      <p>"During the time I was there I learned a huge amount and I enjoyed it immensely. Ultimately I think you want to leave a club feeling like you're a better manager than when you went there and I believe that's the case and it's about showing that now I'm at Hibernian."</p>
      <p>Ross inherits a Hibees side in eighth place in the Scottish Premiership table, just two points above the relegation play-off place.</p>
      <p>The immediate target for the former Sunderland boss is to guide his side away from danger but longer term he believes Hibernian can challenge for the domestic cups and challenging to qualify for European football.</p>
      <p>"Obviously the short-term target is to climb the league," Ross added.</p>
      <p>"The position we are in at the moment, we want to improve upon that and if we can get there and improve that by at least the end of this calendar year, then it gives us a platform for a more successful second half of the season.</p>
      <p>"Beyond that, I think it's a club that should always be challenging in that top four part of the table, seeking to qualify for European football and to challenge for domestic honours in terms of cups.</p>
      <p>"It's doing that consistently. I know the club has done that in recent years and done it well under previous managers, so it's just making sure we can do that year after year. That's the challenge that lies ahead for me.</p>
      <p>"In the early discussions we had, the club want for me to be here for a number of years. I'm not here to use it as a stepping stone and a platform. I want to be a successful Hibs manager and hopefully be here for the long term."</p>
