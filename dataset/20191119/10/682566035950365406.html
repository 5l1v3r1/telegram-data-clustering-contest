      <p>Cape Town - <b>Manchester United</b> are seemingly closing in on signing <b>Erling Haaland</b> after reports claimed the striker's father paid a visit to their training ground.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old has been a revelation for RB Salzburg this season when firing home 15 goals in 12 appearances and he has shot to the top of United's wanted list.</p>
      <p>Reports have suggested that United will open talks with the Austrian outfit in the January transfer window with a view to doing a deal, but they could be much further down the line with the transfer.</p>
      <p>It has been claimed the player's dad, former Manchester City and Leeds United star Alfe-Inge Haaland, has already been to check out United's facilities at Carrington to see what his son could expect.</p>
      <p>It would suggest that despite interest from a number of Europe's big guns, the young striker is leaning towards a move to Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>The fact that fellow Norwegian Ole Gunnar Solskjaer remains at the helm for United is also a big plus point for the youngster.</p>
      <p>Haaland is said to be keen on a switch to the Premier League over anywhere else, but there is also interest from Liverpool and possibly Arsenal.</p>
      <p>However, United have nipped in first and will be hoping to get a deal done as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Salzburg are reluctant to sell in the January transfer window, but United hope to get round that issue by offering to loan him back for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>United were heavily criticised for allowing Romelu Lukaku to leave before bringing in a replacement during the summer and someone is needed to provide back up to the likes of Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood and Anthony Martial.</p>
      <p>Haaland could be the man but the club's fans could have to wait until next season before seeing him in the red of United.</p>
