      <p>Last week (November 16), Alana opened up on social media about how the death of her “best friend” inspired the track.</p>
      <p>The band originally announced the news of the new release on November 14 alongside a clip of Danielle performing part of the song on acoustic guitar.</p>
      <p>You can listen to the new song and watch its accompanying video here:</p>

      <p>Last week, Alana, the youngest Haim sister, expanded on the meaning of the song. “We have a song called hallelujah coming out on Monday,” she tweeted. “It’s a song about family, love, loss, and being thankful for it all. It’s hard to talk about my verse in the song but I wanted to open up about it so here i go…”</p>
      <p>She went on to explain that the track was specifically informed by an experience from “a really dark time” when she was 20 years old.</p>
      <p>“I woke up on a hazy October morning to find out that my best friend, Sammi Kane Kraft, had passed away in a tragic car accident. It was a loss that changed my life forever.” Read the full text below.</p>

      <p>The new track is an original song, not a cover of <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/leonard-cohen">Leonard Cohen</a>‘s classic ‘Hallelujah’, though <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/haim-cover-leonard-cohens-if-it-be-your-will-for-upcoming-hanukkah-album-2567337">Haim have covered the Canadian songwriter’s ‘If It Be Your Will’</a> for a new Hanukkah compilation album.</p>
      <p>The Los Angeles sisters contributed to the upcoming ‘Hanukkah+’, which will also see the likes of <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/tenacious-d">Jack Black</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-flaming-lips">The Flaming Lips</a>, and <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/adam-green">Adam Green</a> offer up new recordings.</p>
      <p>Produced by Randall Poster, the collection is due for digital release on November 22 via Verve Forecast Records.</p>
