      <p>Most of the time, social media a non-stop deluge of excrement. Constant negativity spewed into the digital ether, making us all hate the world just a little bit more with every scroll. It’s awful.</p>
      <p>But that’s where <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4hgzzOoLW8/">Instagram star Uwe Baltner</a> comes in. The German car karaoke enthusiast has become a hit on Instagram with his wholesome #content, which is simply, singing songs in his car.</p>
      <p>As his bio says, “Singing in my Fiat 500, I spread music and fun all around the world!” and that’s precisely what he does. Now with over 1 million followers, Uwe records himself singing a different song each day while sat behind the wheel of his hatchback.</p>
      <p>He takes requests from his legions of followers and has so far belted out renditions of <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/megadeth/">Megadeth</a>’s Symphony Of Destruction, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/motorhead-1/">Motörhead</a>’s Ace Of Spades, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/green-day/">King Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard</a>’s Planet B and Green Day’s Jesus Of Suburbia – all of which you can watch below.</p>
      <p>But he’s also taken on the likes of Cardi B, Childish Gambino, Wu-Tang Clan, Abba and Nicki Minaj. It’s pretty much the best thing on Instagram right now.</p>
      <p>Check Uwe out for yourself.</p>
