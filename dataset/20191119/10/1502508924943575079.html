      <p>Tension prevailed on the campus of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/banaras-hindu-university">Banaras Hindu University </a>(BHU) on Tuesday after a photograph of nationalist leader Veer Savarkar was defaced.</p>
      <p>The incident took place in the political science department where photographs of several nationalist leaders, including Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, adorn the walls.</p>
      <p>The incident came to light on Tuesday morning when students of M.A. first year reached their classroom and saw the photograph of Savarkar lying on the ground.</p>
      <p>The miscreants had also splashed ink on the photograph.</p>
      <p>Angry students immediately sat on a 'dharna'. Senior <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bhu">BHU </a>officials have condemned the incident and have set up a three-member committee to probe the incident.</p>
      <p>A heavy deployment of police has been made on the campus to prevent fallout of the incident.</p>
