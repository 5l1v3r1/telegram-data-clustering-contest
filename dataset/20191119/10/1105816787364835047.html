      <h1>Gal Gadot, Ben Affleck join 'Justice League' fans in demanding #ReleaseTheSnyderCut</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:57:28+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>Recently DC fans have been demanding Zack Snyder’s original cut of <i>Justice League</i> and it seems they have earned the support of Wonder Woman and The Dark Knight. After the hashtag #ReleaseTheSnyderCut went viral on social media, Gal Gadot and Ben Affleck also tweeted with the same hashtag on Sunday, showing their support to the cause.</p>

      <p>Gadot’s tweet had no context and simply a black and white picture of the actor with hashtag #ReleaseTheSnyderCut, while Affleck’s tweet followed his fans, who were trying to get trending on Sunday to mark the second anniversary of the release of<i> Justice League</i>.</p>

      <p>Snyder, the original director of the film, had stepped down during post-production of the film, after the unfortunate death of his daughter. Following this, Joss Whedon was hired to finish the editing after which he also re-shot the scenes he wrote himself, according to <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/justice-league-gal-gadot-ben-afflek-zack-snyder-releasethesnydercut/"><i>The Wrap</i></a>.</p>
      <p>However,<i> Justice League</i> ended up being no <i>Avengers</i>, with lukewarm fan reception and grossing well below $1 billion at the box office.</p>
      <p>Since then, fans have been demanding Warner Bros to re-release the film of the original cut that Snyder intended, one that composer Tom <i>Junkie XL</i> Holkenborg confirmed had a score composed for it before it was replaced by Whedon.</p>
      <p>“The full score is still there,” Holkenborg told <i><a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483465/justice-league-composer-confirms-the-snyder-cut-of-the-score">CinemaBlend</a> </i>last month. “It’s a really great score, and it’s just there. It never goes away. We’ll see what happens in the future, you know?”</p>
      <p>As for Gadot, she is still an active part of the DC Universe, getting ready to appear as Diana Prince for the fourth time on the big screen in <i>Wonder Woman 1984</i>, set for release on June 5.</p>
