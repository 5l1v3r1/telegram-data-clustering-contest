      <p>The <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> driver had been in second tailing <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> for the majority of the race before teammate <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a>’ retirement brought out a safety car.<br/> <br/>Hamilton was ordered to do the opposite of Verstappen who pitted leaving the Briton in the lead but was passed at the restart before the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> collision brought out another safety car with only a few laps to go.<br/> <br/>The Briton strangely pitted for fresh tyres and had to fight with Albon for second, eventually bumping into the side trying to overtake and spinning him off.<br/> <br/><i>"It was a great race, I thoroughly enjoyed it and it was hopefully fun for people to watch, although the result is upsetting,” </i>Hamilton said. <br/><i> </i><br/><i>“I never want to collide with anyone, it was really unfortunate with Alex. Naturally I take it on me, it was my fault, I was coming from behind. </i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“He was doing a great job, so apologies to him. I gave it absolutely everything and more today, I was pushing so hard in every lap just to keep up with Max in front of me. </i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“We really didn’t have a lot of pace today and I think we were probably going faster than we should have gone.”</i><br/> <br/>Hamilton praised Red Bull for their result though as he was classified seventh place after a five-second time penalty from third for the collision with Albon.<br/> <br/><i>“Congratulations to Red Bull, they did the better job today and deserved the win. They were extremely quick today, I was basically a sitting duck on the straights,” </i>he added.<br/><i> </i><br/><i>“There’s one more race to go in this season, so we will be pushing for a better result in Abu Dhabi."</i></p>
