      <p><b>Hop Along’s Frances Quinlan</b> has shared a second single from her upcoming solo album <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/hop-alongs-frances-quinlan-announces-solo-album-tour-shares-rare-thing/"><i>Likewise</i></a> (due January 31 via <a href="https://francesquinlan.ffm.to/likewise">Saddle Creek</a>). The new song is called “Now That I’m Back,” and it sees Frances delivering her trademark vocals over some lovely keys. Here’s what she says about it:</p>
      <blockquote>I find it mystifying that my idea of love has aged and changed right alongside me. I’d always thought of love as something one is given, I didn’t think much about my own capacity for love, for generosity. That’s too bad, but now I understand a little better, I hope. At this point I think love is always there, it exists in the margins, one needs only to access it (though this occasionally requires some struggle and at times some pain). <br/><br/>Compromise is often required for the survival of most relationships. I was thinking about my struggles with compromise for the sake of understanding someone outside myself. It’s a long road, I think this song just portrays the start of it. Love is always around, even as great chunks of time drift from us and we inevitably find ourselves altered and wondering how we got to this place. I frighten myself with thoughts of love disappearing from my life, or of my hardening as a person. I’ve had some odd chapters over the last few years. I think this song came out of one of them.</blockquote>
