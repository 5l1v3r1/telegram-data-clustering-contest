      <h1>2020 Ford Ranger FX4: coming soon to PH?</h1>
      <h2>Ford Ranger FX4 gets 4x4 looks...sans four-wheel drive</h2>

      <p>Even though Ford gave the Ranger a host of technical updates, they’re not resting their laurels just yet. After all, Isuzu just launched the all-new D-Max, and Mitsubishi heavily updated the Strada about a year ago. So what is Ford doing to keep people talking about that Ranger?</p>

      <p>They added a new variant to the range. </p>
      <p>Just before the year comes to a close, Ford has introduced the FX4 edition. If that name sounds familiar, that’s because they’ve used that name before. We even tested one <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/car-reviews/2017-ford-ranger-fx4.html">a couple of years ago</a>. </p>

      <p>So what’s new with the 2020 Ranger FX4 then? It adapts the new front and rear bumpers as seen on the XLT, and a portion of the apron has been blacked out. One noticeable difference in the FX4 is the grill. It appears to have been lifted off the US-spec Ranger, and it’s certainly unique in the current ASEAN line-up. </p>
      <p>Other additions? The wheels have been upsized from 17-inches in the standard XLT, to 18-inch alloys. The wheels have also been given a gloss black finish to make it look a bit more aggressive. A metal sports bar is part of the package, along with FX4 decals and badging on the doors and tailgate. </p>

      <p>Unlike the exterior, you’ll have to look a little bit closer to spot the additions to the cabin. Yes, you get the standard XLT interior, but the FX4 gets upgraded to leather seats with red contrast stitching.  More of these stitches can be seen on the dashboard and door panels. Faux carbon fiber trim is another addition to the pick-up, and the FX4 name is embossed on the front seats. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Powering the FX4 is the same engine found in the XLT. No, it doesn’t use the new 2.0-liter turbo. Instead, it’s the familiar 2.2-liter TDCI mill that’s been powering the Ranger since late 2011. It’s good for 160 PS and 385 Nm of torque. Shifting is done via a six-speed automatic transmission. </p>
      <p>Given that the FX4 has been offered here in the past, there is a strong possibility of it landing in the country.</p>
