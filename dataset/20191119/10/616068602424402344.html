      <p>The clear bag pick-up program is over for Vernon, but there is still time to get rid of your leaves.</p>
      <p>Residents can drop off their remaining bags at the Regional District's Diversion and Disposal Facility for free, or you can put your leaf bags with the allotted weekly pick up of two bags.</p>
      <p>Over limit garbage tags can be bought at City Hall or Recreation Services for $1.50.</p>
