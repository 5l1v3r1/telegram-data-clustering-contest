      <p>Cape Town - <b>Stormers </b>hooker<b> Ramone Samuels'</b> career is hanging in the balance due to a troublesome ankle.</p>
      <p>This was revealed by Stormers coach <b>John Dobson</b> during a media briefing at the team's High Performance Centre in Bellville on Monday.</p>
      <p>Dobson said he expected to have a fully fit squad available for the start of the 2020 Super Rugby competition, with the exception of Samuels.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old has not played rugby since suffering an ankle injury in a friendly match against French club Montpellier in August 2018.</p>
      <p>"The guy that we have grave concerns about is Ramone. I think he's potentially got a career-threatening injury. It's very sad. He's got a nerve that's not regenerating in his ankle. The break was so bad... a call (on Samuels' future) is going to be made in February."</p>
      <p>Samuels, who is the brother of Stormers utility back Damian Willemse, has been on the Cape franchise's books since 2017.</p>
      <p>Samuels was schooled at Paul Roos in Stellenbosch and after playing for the Western Province under-19 team after school, he moved to Johannesburg where he spent time at the Lions.</p>
