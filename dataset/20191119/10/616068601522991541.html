      <p>A home-grown Kelowna music festival returnsÂ for 2020, expanding to three days this year.</p>
      <p>Fireside Festival began in the living room of Aaron DeSilva's Upper Mission home in the winter of 2014, as a chance to show off the musical talents of his friends for a night.</p>
      <p>The festival <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/157441/jamming-by-the-fireside">quickly outgrew the home</a>, moving to BNA Brewing Co. in 2016, and <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/217346/music-takes-over-bna">expanding to two days</a> of music in 2018.</p>
      <p>DeSilva, who DJs locally under the name Deepsounds, released the lineup for the seventh iteration of the festival Monday night.</p>
      <p>The festival will run Jan. 24-26, taking place across Kelowna at Dunnenzies Pizza's Mission location Friday night, the new Rustic Reel Brewing Co. Saturday afternoon, and BNA Saturday night and all day Sunday.</p>
      <p>Saturday night at BNA will be headlined by Vancouver's Little Destroyer, who played the festival in 2018, while Sunday will headlined by Snotty Nose Rez Kids. The hip-hop duo, originally from Kitimaat Village on B.C.'s coast, were nominated for a Juno Award for Indigenous Music Album of the Year in 2019.</p>
      <p>Friday night at Dunnenzies will feature a hip-hop showcase, while acoustic sets will take over Rustic Reel Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The full lineup, along with tickets to the festival, can be found <a href="https://www.firesidefestival.ca/">here</a>.</p>
