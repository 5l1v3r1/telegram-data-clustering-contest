      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/loewe">LOEWE</a> is back with its latest <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/fall-winter-2019">FW19</a> piece, a black and white “<a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/loewe-william-de-morgan-capsule-collection-release-info">William De Morgan</a>” Skeleton Turtleneck that’s detailed with a bevy of loose fringes. The piece is from the label’s William De Morgan capsule, inspired by the late artist’s work on tiles, among his vast portfolio of other artworks.</p>
      <p>Boasting a monochromatic color scheme, the sweater is intricately detailed with an intarsia graphic of a skeleton that covers the arms, chest and back. The upper chest is emblazoned with the image of a rib cage, while the lower midbody and hem depict the torso and waist. Several bones are imagined at the arms, woven at the front and sides. The back reflects the rear side of the rib cage, followed by a large motif of the spinal cord. As a final note, loose yarn is spread throughout the piece, adding extra depth to the wool construction.</p>
      <p>The LOEWE “William De Morgan” Skeleton Turtleneck is currently available at <a href="https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/loewe/black-and-white-william-de-morgan-skeleton-turtleneck/4607321">SSENSE.COM</a> for $1300 USD.</p>
