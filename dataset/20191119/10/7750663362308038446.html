      <p>Meanwhile, the Knicks' crosstown rivals the Brooklyn Nets lost 115-86 to the Indiana Pacers.</p>
      <p>Without their star point guard Kyrie Irving, the Nets were no match for Indiana.</p>
      <p>The Pacers were without two of their starters, but dominated throughout the game.</p>
      <p>Domantas Sabonis's physicality played a starring role as he got 16 points and 18 rebounds for Indiana.</p>

      <p>The Boston Celtics got back to winning ways in Arizona as they beat the Phoenix Suns 99-85.</p>
      <p>In bad news for Boston, though, guard Marcus Smart sprained his right ankle in the fourth quarter, after getting 17 points, three rebounds, four assists, two steals and a block.</p>
      <p>On 11-2, the Celtics lead the Eastern Conference, while the Suns' loss see them drop to seventh in the Western, on 7-5.</p>
