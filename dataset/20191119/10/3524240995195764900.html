      <h1>Measles death toll in Samoa rises to 15 —UNICEF</h1>

      <p>The death toll from a measles outbreak raging in the Pacific nation of Samoa has risen to 15, with most of the victim’s young children, UNICEF said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The UN children’s agency said that suspected measles cases had topped 1,000 in the island nation, which has declared a state of emergency and launched a compulsory vaccination programme.</p>
      <p>“The epidemic has claimed the lives of 14 children under-five years old and one adult,” it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>UNICEF said it was in the process of delivering more than 110,000 doses of measles vaccine to Samoa’s population of about 200,000.</p>
      <p>With the virus sweeping through the South Pacific, the agency said it had also sent vaccines to Tonga and Fiji.</p>
      <p>Officials were also helping with preparations for potential outbreaks in Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, the Cook Islands, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia.</p>
      <p>It said Samoa, which is by far the worst affected, had low measles vaccination rates of 28-40 per cent.</p>
      <p>In Tonga and Fiji, which have vaccination rates of 99 per cent and 81 per cent respectively, the outbreak is more contained and there have been no fatalities.</p>
      <p>Children are the most vulnerable to measles, which typically causes a rash and fever but can also lead to brain damage and death.</p>
      <p>Samoa has closed all schools and kindergartens, as well as banning children from public gatherings, in a bid to halt the spread of the virus.</p>
      <p>After initially facing criticism for its slow response, the government had opened a national emergency operations centre to roll out mass vaccinations.</p>
