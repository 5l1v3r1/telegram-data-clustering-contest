      <p>Sheriff’s investigators say a “suspicious package” flagged during the screening process at Florida’s Daytona Beach International Airport turned out to be a bottle of lotion.</p>
      <p>The incident forced about 200 passengers and workers to evacuate the airport at about 6:15 a.m. on Tuesday. Airport officials gave an all-clear more than an hour later, resuming normal operations.</p>
      <p>Volusia County Sheriff’s Office posted a statement online thanking people for their patience and saying “the object of concern was a bottle of lotion.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Mike Chitwood said during a news conference that the item was described as a possible detonator during the screening process. The bomb squad was called. Chitwood described the incident as “better safe than sorry.”</p>
      <p>Officials said two flights were delayed because of the evacuation.</p>
