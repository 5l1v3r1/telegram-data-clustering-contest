      <p>The coldest spot in the east of England overnight was at Santon Downham, the weather station in the west of Suffolk recorded a temperature of -4.4C.</p>
      <p>The village of Writtle in Essex was almost as cold at -3.5C and many commuters will have faced icy roads or freezing fog as they made their way to work today.</p>
      <p>However East Anglian forecasters Weatherquest say that this cold snap is unlikely to stick around.</p>
      <p>Forecaster Adam Dury said: "Last night saw temperatures of -2C or -3C widely across the region, but it will be turning milder this week and next.</p>
      <p>"There is little chance of frost on the cars for the next few nights, but there could briefly be frost in north-east Suffolk tonight.</p>
      <p>"Most places across Suffolk will stay above freezing temperatures for the foreseeable future, with a chance of light showers in patches tomorrow night.</p>
      <p>"There may also be rain Thursday overnight into Friday."</p>
