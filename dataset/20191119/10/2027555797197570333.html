      <h1>Karnataka bypolls: 248 candidates file nominations</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:29:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/akram-mohammed" target="_blank">Akram Mohammed</a></address>
      <p>As many as 248 candidates are in fray for the crucial bypolls to 15 constituencies of Karnataka scheduled on Dec. 5.</p>
      <p>Hoskote constituency, which is witnessing a fight between Congress rebel who joined BJP, MTB Nagaraj, and BJP rebel backed by JD(S) and independent candidate Sharath Bachegowda, has the maximum number of contestants at 22. Yellapur constituency in Uttara Kannada district has the least number of contestants at three.</p>
      <p>According to data by the State Election Commission, a total of 353 nominations were filed at the end of November 18 - the last date to file nominations. The numbers are expected to drop by November 21, which is the last date for withdrawal of nominations.</p>
      <p>A total of 56 candidates from national parties will contest in the polls, while 17 candidates from state parties are in the fray. As many as 128 candidates, which include those who contested the previous elections from national parties in the 2018 Assembly polls, have filed nominations as independents, while the number of candidates by registered unrecognised parties is 47.</p>
      <p>Byeelections for the 15 constituencies are being held following a protracted legal battle involving rebel Congress and JD(S) legislators, who resigned from the State government and were subsequently disqualified by former Legislative Assembly speaker K R Ramesh Kumar. The Supreme Court, recently, upheld their disqualification but allowed the rebels to contest in the bypolls.</p>
