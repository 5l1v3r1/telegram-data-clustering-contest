      <p>When you think about it, aren’t reruns the television version of delicious leftovers? Just like your aunt’s famous stuffing, a perfect episode of TV is just as good, if not better, the second, third, or fourth time you try it. These Thanksgiving episodes of your favorite shows are definitely worth a rewatch this holiday...and they won’t make you feel too stuffed to move.</p>

      <p>Blair Waldorf is the HBIC of Thanksgiving, and that’s a fact. Although every single season of <i>Gossip Girl</i> serves us a delicious Thanksgiving episode, season 1 sets the bar high with flashbacks of Serena drunk as a skunk (in broad daylight) the year before, a look into Blair’s past, and the reveal of Rufus and Lily’s extremely complicated history.</p>

      <p>This Thanksgiving episode of <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> might be the most relatable television to ever exist. Izzie wants to have the perfect Turkey Day, but she is literally clueless and has no idea what to do. I mean, you can’t really blame her. This episode aired in 2005 and Pinterest wasn’t even invented until 2010. How do you cook anything without Pinterest?</p>

      <p>I am thankful that the entire staff of Dunder Mifflin does not take the week of Thanksgiving off. Now, we can all experience the sheer joy that is this episode of <i>The Office</i>. Dwight deals with some childhood trauma the only way he knows how...by creating an elaborate hay festival so he can finally be crowned Hay King. Also, Ryan tries to scam everyone out of a ton of money. Festive!</p>

      <p>There are 10 Thanksgiving episodes of Friends, but this one is the best. Don’t @ me. Monica, Joey, Chandler, Phoebe, Rachel, and Ross sit around sharing their holiday horror stories. Although a group of people trying to one-up each other is typically obnoxious, this particular scenario is comedic gold.</p>

      <p>Rory and Lorelai attend FOUR Turkey Day feasts, which sounds like a total nightmare given the fact that one must wear real pants and take post-meal trips away from the couch. Although the Gilmores spend a solid chunk of the episode eating, they left plenty of room for their famous mother-daughter banter.</p>

      <p>In the best way possible, “Three Turkeys” is one of the shadiest episodes on this list. Everyone’s trying to either skip out on dinner, avoid dressing up, or troll each other’s ability to cook. Basically, the <i>Modern Family</i> crew living out your absolute best Thanksgiving dreams.</p>

      <p>There’s really only one reason to watch this, and it’s Uncle Jesse (in all his first-season, borderline-mullet glory) cooking a turkey in a leather vest. Have mercy!</p>

      <p>For transparency purposes, you should probably know that this episode of <i>Jane the Virgin</i> is barely related to Thanksgiving at all. It actually spans a period of four months. But you know what? That’s totally fine, because sometimes you just can’t sit through 45 minutes of a show about fictional characters eating turkey and potatoes. It’s like there’s tryptophan in it or something.</p>

      <p>You need to watch this episode of <i>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</i> for the sole purpose of discovering what you’re thankful for. (Seriously...you should probs prepare that ahead of time this year so you’re not blindsided when your aunt asks for once.)</p>
      <p>Jacqueline says she’s thankful for “loving someone other than herself…and revenge,” and honestly, we should all aspire to be that iconic.</p>

      <p>Apparently, the town of Bluebell celebrates Planksgiving instead of Thanksgiving. It symbolizes the time a bunch of pirates came through after Hurricane Katrina to have a fish fry...even though that didn’t actually happen. But hey! It’s still a nice sentiment!</p>

      <p>This is undoubtedly the most unrealistic episode of the whole bunch. Laurie brings a “sexy friend” home from college to celebrate the holiday with the Forman crew. As if there will ever be a “sexy” person at any Thanksgiving event you attend ever.</p>
