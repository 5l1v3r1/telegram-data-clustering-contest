      <p>He was also sentenced for two counts of battery against a woman who he punched in the eye and pulled her hair, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/violent-birmingham-knifeman-aiden-morrisey-17278403">Birmingham Live</a> reported.</p>

      <p>He is white, five foot 10 inches tall and has grey eyes and brown hair. He also has the word "mom" tattooed on his right arm.</p>
      <p>Morrissey was jailed after he repeatedly stabbed Will Flint, an award-winning fitness competitor, when Flint intervened in the teenager attacking a woman at a cashpoint.</p>
      <p>Mr Flint - who was 27 at the time - had heard a commotion in the early hours of New Years Day and went to help when Morrissey attacked, leaving him with a dozen separate knife wounds and 60 stitches.</p>

      <p>Speaking at the time, Mr Flint said the severity of his wounds meant he would no longer be able to compete in the professional fitness sphere.</p>
      <p>A police spokesman said: "If you have seen Morrissey or know of his whereabouts, please do not approach him, instead contact the police immediately quoting reference number 19561817."</p>
      <p>Anyone with any information can also call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
