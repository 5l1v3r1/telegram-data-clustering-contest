      <h2>How a former international Netball player forayed into Malayalam cinema and landed a project with Mammootty</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:26:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Pradeep-Kumar-33037/" target="_blank">Pradeep Kumar</a></address>
      <p>Pursuing a career in films was never on the agenda for Prachi Tehlan.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old from Delhi, who is a former international Netball player, quit a promising career in sports in 2011 (shortly after leading the Indian women’s team to its first-ever silver medal) because she wanted to focus on academics. “My parents have never forced me to do anything in life, but I do come from a fairly orthodox family. For them, an ideal career for me was to have been a teacher, get married and handle the family and kids while I continued to work,” she says.</p>
      <p>Then, almost four years ago, Prachi, who was by now a management graduate and working as a consultant with Accenture in Delhi, received an offer (on Facebook no less, she adds) from a Mumbai-based production house, who were the show-runners of the popular soap <i>Diya Aur Baati Hum</i> on Star Plus. It took her a lot of self-convincing to switch paths. She also had the small task of winning over her parents besides explaining her choice to her employers.</p>
      <p>Since then, there has been no looking back, and now, ahead of her upcoming film, <i>Mamangam</i>, a Malayalam film where she co-stars with actor Mammootty, Prachi is confident that her transition from the small screen onto the celluloid world is complete.</p>
      <h3>Tall order</h3>
      <p><i>Mamangam</i>, directed by M Padmakumar, is slated to hit the screens on December 12. It will also simultaneously release in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi.</p>

      <p>A period film, <i>Mamangam</i> is set against the backdrop of a medieval festival of the same name. The events in the film take place in 1695 at Thirunavaya, located in modern-day Malappuram district of Kerala, where a warrior community called the <i>chavers</i> wages a battle against the Zamorins — the rulers of Calicut, in a bid to overthrow them.</p>
      <p>Prachi plays Unni Maya, a <i>devadasi</i> character. The actor still finds it hard to believe that Padmakumar (‘Pappettan’, as she calls him) offered her the role because her audition did not turn out the way she expected it to. One reason was that the clothes offered to her, similar to those she sports in the film, made her uncomfortable. “And then they gave me dialogues in Malayalam!” she laughs, adding, “<i>Ab do ghantein mein</i> Malayalam dialogues <i>karoon ya</i>... (what do I do in two hours with Malayalam dialogues?)... should I perform or should I handle my costume?”</p>
      <p>Padmakumar’s brief was that whatever she chooses to do, she had to have dance in her body. “...and I’m a sportsperson. Not a classical dancer. So, for five minutes, I was very nervous, and I kept telling myself ‘What to do, Prachi? You shouldn’t have come.’. But Pappettan said he only needed my expressions. So, I translated the lines into Hindi and gave whatever he asked of me,” she says.</p>
      <h3>Risky business</h3>
      <p>The next morning, Padmakumar rang Prachi to inform that she was on board. But the actor still had her reservations (read as: casting couch). “It is there in all film industries, and I have heard a lot. So, I penned down all the questions I had, and I asked Pappettan because if that was the case, that is a big deal for me, no? When I told him, he started laughing and assured me that I didn’t have to worry about it. He also explained how there was not going to be any bold scenes or kissing scenes, and how it would only be sensually projected,” she adds.</p>
      <p>The seductive steps apart, Prachi also had to do her own stunts in <i>Mamangam</i>. She is not trained in stunts but the filmmakers had enough confidence in her sporting past, and told her that she would ace it. “It was my first time holding a sword, being suspended from cranes, doing somersaults and jumping over horses,” she says, and points to the injuries on her body. “I call it the ‘Mamangam scars’,” she adds.</p>
      <h3>Weight of history</h3>
      <p>With <i>Mamangam</i>, Prachi makes her film début alongside a veteran of Indian cinema, actor Mammootty, who is 42 years her senior. But age can just be a number, she attests. “It was he who recommended the movies and web series that I should watch.He is very tech savvy, and keeps himself updated. He was also kind enough to get me home-cooked food on the set,” she says.</p>

      <p>Mammootty, who appears in three different looks in the film (including the one with him sporting a wig and appearing feminine, which went viral online recently) has also performed his own stunts. “I think the younger generation needs to know about this history. It is a non-fiction film, and if it was released only in Malayalam, it would have stayed in Kerala. <i>Mamangam</i> is beautiful content, and an experience that you must go to a cinema and watch,” Prachi says.</p>
      <p>The actor is quite excited about <i>Mamangam</i>’s prospects, and not just because its potential success could guarantee her more films. “It has been a difficult last six months. I have had to wait because when you are making your début, people have their eyes on you but nobody wants to take a gamble until they are convinced of what I can offer. But now that I have waited, I will be demanding when the next offer comes through,” she laughs.</p>
