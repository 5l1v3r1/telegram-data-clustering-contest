      <p>Sportswear company PUMA has re-engineered its innovative line of FUTURE football boots with the FUTURE Flash. Combining dynamic movement and flexible comfort, the FUTURE Flash allows for maximum mobility for the modern player.</p>
      <p>Crafted with input from PUMA ambassador Thierry Henry, the FUTURE Flash is designed for matches that move faster than ever. Defenders are more intelligent, athletic and resolute, requiring forwards to adapt quickly or fall behind. The result is a new breed of players who make better use of space, attack from new angles and break apart the competition. PUMA's FUTURE Flash is created with their needs in mind.</p>
      <p>Taking cues from the on-field brilliance of Antoine Griezmann, Luis Suarez, Marco Reus and Dzsenifer Marozsan, the FUTURE Flash reacts to the movement of the foot. It contains an adaptable NETFIT support in a fully knitted upper for added fit and stability.</p>
      <p>Key strike zones of the boot are moulded with an enhanced GripControl Pro layer, improving ball control in the key impact zones. Rounding out the design is the super lightweight RAPIDAGILITY outsole that combines conical and bladed studs to aid traction in all conditions, supporting explosive multidirectional movement.</p>
