      <p>Rafa Benitez may be thousands of miles away in China but walk into any UK newsagent in the next month and you are likely to find the former <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> manager's portrait staring back at you.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old is <a href="https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/fourfourtwo-latest-issue-rafa-benitez-sven-simeone-scolari-potter-pep">FourFourTwo</a> magazine's cover star for their December issue, dubbed a managers special, and nine pages are devoted to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/rafa-benitez">Benitez</a> in the main spread as he discusses life in China at Dalian Yifang and his career to date in a wide-ranging interview.</p>
      <p>While home on the Wirral, Benitez spoke to the world's biggest football magazine about everything from the legacy he is looking to leave at Dalian to the conversation he really had with Cristiano Ronaldo about free-kicks.</p>
      <p>Here are eight excerpts from the interview.</p>
      <h3>Waiting on a takeover last summer</h3>
      <p>"I was waiting for Newcastle until the last minute. But because there was no takeover and nothing was changing, I didn't want to stay in another survival battle.</p>

      <p>"I said, 'Which are the options we have at the moment?' The top sides in Europe weren't available so I said, 'OK, I have this opportunity'. People say, 'Oh, but the league isn't strong' - yes, I know, but it's a project and they want to do well."</p>
      <h3>The emotional last game - and wishing Steve Bruce all the best</h3>
      <p>"My idea was to grow, to compete and to be sure we could challenge. But there was another vision and that was it. If you see the profit of the team in the last few years, we did what we needed to do to be successful. And that, it's up to him.</p>
      <p>"I still love the city, the fans and the players. My last game as manager was emotional: we won 4-0 at Fulham and the supporters were singing my name at the end, trying to convince me to stay. I have a lot of very good memories. I wish them and Steve Bruce all the best. But I couldn't stay there just trying to survive for another year."</p>
      <h3>Benitez insists his move to China was not about the money after Mike Ashley's previous claim</h3>
      <p>"I have to answer that because he knows it's not like that. I wouldn't have stayed in the Championship and said no to massive offers if I was just thinking about that. I waited until the last minute this summer. But I don't want to create more mess around that situation by talking more about it. I don't want the fans thinking, 'Rafa is talking too much about Newcastle'. Now it's the time to move forward."</p>
      <h3>Had Arsenal been a possibility in 2018?</h3>
      <p>"At the beginning, they were talking options but you never know until they decide."</p>
      <h3>Unity was the strength last season</h3>
      <p>"It was a relegation battle. We didn't win the first few games but we were consistent in doing things right and in the end we stayed up. The players fought until the end and the fans were behind the team. We had unity. That was our strength."</p>
      <h3>Benitez felt the summer of 2017 was the time to grow</h3>
      <p>"When we got promoted, that was the time to grow. OK, we finished 10th, then 13th. It was fine with the resources we had."</p>
      <h3>That special game against Spurs on the final day in 2016</h3>
      <p>"We were relegated and Tottenham were playing for second place but we won 5-1 with 10 men and the fans were singing my name. That was a key point in my decision. The fans were behind me and all the players. We decided to take a massive risk by staying for the Championship because it's such a difficult league. The main thing was to get promoted - and we won the league."</p>
      <h3>The belief that the great escape was possible when he took over - but injuries took their toll</h3>
      <p>"We thought, 'The team isn't too bad - maybe we can do it. But when I arrived, we had 13 players out injured. Then we were unlucky in the first few games."</p>
