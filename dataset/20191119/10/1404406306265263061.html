      <p>Instagram comedian Chicklet referenced <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/258979/omarion-breaks-his-silence-on-lil-fizz-apryl-jones-relationship">Omarion's viral VladTV interview</a> to tell his girlfriend Maleni that she can leave him for his friend. Chicklet tells Maleni, "Bro, did you not see Omarion's energy? He was so proud of his baby mother for being with his boy. He was so happy for her." </p>
      <p>Maleni then explained that she wasn't going to leave Chicklet, telling him, "First of all, you's a bum and your friends are bums too." She then added that Cheeks is just a higher level bum than his friends, so she decided to stay. </p>
