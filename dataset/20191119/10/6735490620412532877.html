      <p>Harry Connick Jr. once had a pretty uncomfortable experience with Frank Sinatra.</p>
      <p>The singer and actor appeared on Tuesday’s “This Morning” and recalled having to sing for Sinatra in the early ’90s, according to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7701573/Harry-Connick-Jr-reveals-completely-inappropriate-moment-Frank-Sinatra-kissed-wife-lips.html">the Daily Mail</a>.</p>

      <p>“That was an unpleasant experience because as much as I wanted to sing for him and everyone else…” he said. “I don’t get nervous but I was really nervous for that and I blanked out.”</p>
      <p>Connick also recalled being there with his wife Jill Goodacre, whom he married in 1994.</p>
      <p>“I completely forget the words,” he said. “I was with my wife, then my girlfriend, and then we saw Frank at the lift and I said, ‘We should go, I need to explain myself.'”</p>
      <p>He continued, “I said ‘I’m sorry I’m much better than what I saw,’ and he took my wife and held her face and said you’re beautiful, and kissed her on the mouth and that’s that.”</p>

      <p>Looking back on that moment, Connick now sees it as problematic.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never been able to sing for him again,” he said. “It was probably unacceptable then, it was a situation where it was an interesting thing, I think my affection for him in the context made it hilarious for her, but obviously it’s completely inappropriate.”</p>
