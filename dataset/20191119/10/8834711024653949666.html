      <p>Your boss probably isn’t funny. And they don’t have much in common with a stand-up comedian, or at least that’s what you might think.</p>
      <p>Cesar Cervantes explores the relationship between leaders and stand-up comedians — from bombing to thriving. Former college dean, comedian and founder of Stand-Up At Work, Cesar Cervantes believes everyone should try stand-up comedy. After years of teaching his course, Stand-Up Comedy Writing &amp; Performance at Colorado College, he began to see relationship between comedy and leadership. He experienced the benefits of these insights both personally and professionally and now, he’s on a mission to bring it to you.</p>
      <p>This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.</p>
