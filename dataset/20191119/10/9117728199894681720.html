      <p>Of the back of four podium finishes in a row, including two wins, Bottas’ Brazilian Grand Prix proved to be troublesome one with a lack of pace before having to retire due to a high oil consumption causing issues.<br/> <br/><i>"It was a tricky race overall, even before I had to retire the car,” </i>said Bottas.<i> “The pace wasn’t quite there today, so we will have to investigate that.</i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“I was aiming to do a one-stop and go to the end on the Hard tyres, but I had to pit again as we were concerned that the tyres wouldn’t last until the end. </i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“It’s obviously not ideal to switch strategies like that, but it didn’t really matter in the end as I didn’t finish the race.”</i><br/> <br/>As for why there was an unexpectedly high oil consumption from the Finn’s Mercedes the 30-year old isn’t sure what caused it yet but is looking forward to the season ending race in Abu Dhabi, which he won back in 2017.<br/> <br/><i>“I don’t know the details yet, I just suddenly lost power, so we will have look into that and see what caused it,” </i>he added. <br/><i> </i><br/><i>“It was very disappointing especially since there was a lot happening afterwards, so it would have been nice to be a part of that action. </i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“I’m now looking forward to the race in Abu Dhabi, we want to come back strong and finish the season on a high."</i></p>
