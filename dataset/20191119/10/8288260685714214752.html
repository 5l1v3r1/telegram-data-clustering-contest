      <p>The Cole family bash spans an impressive five generations and this year 120 all got together in the festive spirit.</p>
      <p>The huge Christmas party, held on Sunday in Shirehampton, Bristol, saw a gathering of family members ranging from 82 to just six months old.</p>
      <p>The generations of the Cole family got in the Christmas spirit with a Christmas-themed bonnet parade, a festive tombola with presents wrapped in Christmas paper, and plenty of Christmas tunes.</p>
      <p>For the first time, there was even a “Coles Got Talent” talent show, where young and old alike showcased their performance talents.</p>

      <p>Brenda Cotterell, 58, and her eldest sister Shirley organised this year's family party – carrying on the tradition that their late father, Albert Cole, began 15 years ago.</p>
      <p>Albert was one of ten children, and then went on to have nine children himself with his wife Doris – Brenda's mother.</p>
      <p>The family all live around Bristol - with one member from Wales.</p>
      <p>Brenda said: “My dad loved Christmas so, so much. You could feel his excitement building every year.</p>
      <p>“My father was always the big personality. His great-grandchildren still call him Grandad Lucky Dip, because he would dress up as Father Christmas and would always have a lucky dip to play with them.”</p>

      <p>The Lucky Dip is something that the family have made sure to keep going in Albert's honour, as well as a raffle, with gifts and sweets donated by various family members.</p>
      <p>Brenda added: “My father started this gathering every year after losing his son Andrew, my youngest brother, aged 22, and then losing my mum 28 years ago.</p>
      <p>“As the family has grown, it gets quite hard to keep track of everyone, and know who is who.</p>
      <p>“But I know how much my father would love to see us all together today,” she said.</p>

      <p>And Brenda is not the only one for whom the annual family party means a lot.</p>
      <p>Brenda's sister Shirley, who helped to organise this year's event, said: “It's brilliant to get everyone together.</p>
      <p>“It can be a nightmare trying to visit everyone during the year,” she joked.</p>
      <p>“It's very special to see the generations we have here – from my aunt Joan, to her great-great-great nephew, Ronnie-Jay.”</p>

      <p>And Brenda's cousin Linda, daughter of Albert's eldest brother Arthur, is remarkably one of five generations – the largest branch of the Cole family.</p>
      <p>She said: “It's lovely the effort that Brenda goes to to get everyone together.</p>
      <p>“Thanks to Brenda, I'm now in touch with a lot more members of my family than I would have been otherwise. I keep in touch with a lot of them through Facebook during the year.”</p>
      <p>Brenda's aunt Lin, who is married to Albert's brother Richard – one of four of Albert's surviving siblings – joked that not one person at the party knew everybody else there.</p>

      <p>The great-grandmother of three said: “It's just life, for us. My family have grown up not knowing any differently – this is just normal.</p>
      <p>“My daughter was talking to someone recently who only had two cousins, and she just couldn't believe it. She couldn't fathom them not having more cousins.</p>
      <p>“It's just nice to come to an event like this and not have to worry about keeping an eye on the little ones, or worry about them annoying others, because you know somebody in this hall will be watching them.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Brenda's uncle John, the fifth of 10 siblings, who has 32 great-grandkids of his own, said: “We are all family, but we don't all know each other.</p>
      <p>“This is only about a quarter of us here. It's really good to all get together – but we won't get Christmas presents for everybody here,” he joked.</p>

      <p>Both Brenda and John's wife, Maureen, joked about “marrying into” the Cole family.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Maureen said: “I knew how many siblings John had, but it was quite a change for me, because I'm only one of three.”</p>
      <p>And Brenda thanked her “long-suffering” husband Richard, saying: “He always says he married into 'the tribe'.</p>
      <p>“He puts up with me preparing for this party, wrapping presents, for weeks in advance each year.</p>
      <p>“We don't have any children of our own, so for us, this is our Christmas. We're all quite close, me and my siblings,” she added.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Brenda also thanked the PBA Social Club for allowing the family to host their Christmas party there for the last two years in a row.</p>
      <p>She said: “It's quite a special place for us as a family.</p>
      <p>“In the August before my dad died, in 2012, we celebrated my dad's 88th, my sister's 70th, my 50th, and my niece's 40th birthdays here.</p>
      <p>“We've had wedding parties, christenings, funeral wakes, all in this hall.</p>
      <p>“It's been a big part of all our lives,” Brenda said.</p>
