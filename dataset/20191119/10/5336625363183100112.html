      <h1>This is the one thing you should absolutely buy in November</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/veronika-kero/" target="_blank">Veronika Kero</a></address>
      <p>Have you been feeling SAD? Seasonal Affective Disorder, that is. It's not as uncommon as you may think. The leaves fall, the sun sets at 5 pm, and the seasonal depression begins. While there's nothing you can do to change daylight saving time, you can make your inside space a bit brighter. </p>
      <p>Happy lights are a drug-free way to combat seasonal blues. No prescription is needed, just a place to plug in your personal ball of sunshine. </p>
      <p>Of course, a bright lamp is no match for a qualified therapist or medical professional. If you just can't seem to shake the blues no matter what you do, or if you ever have thoughts of harming yourself or others, know that you are not alone. <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/depression/guide/resources/">Take advantage of these resources</a> to get the help you need. </p>
      <h3>What exactly do happy lights do?</h3>
      <p>They do a lot, actually. Yes, they improve your mood and can make you happy but they can also boost energy, help you focus, and make it easier to maintain a healthy sleep cycle. </p>
      <h3>How do they do it?</h3>
      <p>Light has so much more power than we realize. Exposure to sunlight can decrease drowsiness and increase how alert you feel. Happy lights recreate natural sunlight by using LED lights that mimic color temperature and have high LUX levels. LUX is the measurement of lumens per square meter, which is the intensity of light that the human eye sees. </p>
      <p>

          <b>Yes, you really do need a weighted blanket</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Direct sunlight on a bright day outdoors can have a LUX of 80,000 - 100,000. Though most happy lights have a max LUX of about 10,000, it's enough to reap the rewards. </p>
      <p>Happy lights, SAD lamps, light therapy devices. Whatever you call them, these nifty devices have become pretty trendy in recent years, which means there are a lot of options out there. We took a look at user reviews and have rounded up the top 7 products on Amazon so your winter days can be a little less dark. </p>

When shopping for a light therapy device, this is the brand name most people trust. <a href="https://zdcs.link/DlvkX?utm_linkelement=title&amp;utm_ordinal=1">1.

But don't worry — a large screen doesn't mean more eye fatigue and strain since there are two interchangeable lenses (High-Energy and Comfort Optix Glare-Control).<br/>Customer <a href="https://zdcs.link/VOVkL">Terra Golden writes</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>"If I could give this 10 stars I would!! I was struggling so much with energy levels, I was irritable, I had to talk myself into doing the smallest of tasks getting dressed, picking something off the floor, throwing something the trash even ..all seemed like such a hard chore) . this winter has been very cloudy where I live. It was such a gradual thing that I didn't realize just how BAD I had gotten. But once I was sleeping 12+ hours and still feeling tired, not being able to perform small tasks and being irritable all the time and downright glummy and down I knew something had to change. so I looked into the happy lights. when I saw the symptoms of S.A.D it was then that I knew what my problem may have been. Even then I was skeptical. I mean who would think a simple light could fix ALL of those problems? well within 2 days I noticed a change, it has been a week and I'm like a new person. All kinds of energy, a much better mental state of mind, I am sleeping a normal 6-8hrs at night, my sleep isn't disrupted... I'm a true believer and I wish I had gotten it sooner!! So if you have any doubts...just stop.... press buy NOW! You won't regret it!"</blockquote>

Lucky for you, there are some round options out there and we like this one from <a href="https://zdcs.link/LGVqO">Circadian Optics</a> the best. <br/>The pure white light of the orb-shaped Lampu lamp mimics noonday sunlight and helps adjusts that body clock of yours so that you are less restless and in a better mood even when natural sunlight isn't there to help. This can all be quickly achieved through its one-touch feature, which means there aren't any complicated settings for you to figure out. Although some users did report issues with the button that required them to return or exchange the device. The most common complaint we saw though is that the display of the light doesn't match what's in the product listing. Instead, users report that there are dots of light rather than one glowing orb.<br/>Customer <a href="https://zdcs.link/2kgo1">Kim writes</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>"After years and years of dealing with seasonal depression, I think I may have finally found the cure! It sounds like a miracle quick-fix, but it really is. In the past week, I have made a habit of sitting next to this lamp each morning for 30-40 minutes. I immediately feel the effects of feeling more awake and alert. I am usually sluggish and unresponsive in the morning, but as soon as I sit under my lamp I perk up. The effects last throughout the day, and I no longer feel the heavy weight of depression brought on by the winter months. I am focused and alert at work, motivated to exercise and eat well, and engaged in my relationships. On a different note, the lamp is also really nice to display in my living room. It doesn’t look like a medical device, but rather like a cool modern piece. The light is not the entire surface, as the pictures from another customer show. However, most of the day the light will not be on, and since it is functional, the dot lights shining through the screen aren’t an issue. This lamp has changed my life!!"</blockquote>

      <blockquote>"It looks incredibly elegant and part of the decor so i never have to hide it/put it away. For its smaller size, it is really bright! I'll have it on and walk away and it illuminates my room as if their is a second window providing a nice bright light. it has 3 settings so if you find it too bright you can dim it. I have noticed that when i use it i feel less desire to go for a nap in the afternoon when my day is long. I am still unsure of what angle to have it pointed at because i know it shouldn't be directly facing you? if anyone can describe to me how to angle it that would be great. I have used it for 3 weeks now and have noticed a small increase in my mood for sure. I think you have to find your perfect balance of time to keep it on to see a noticeable difference with S.A.D. affects. I am happy with my purchase!"</blockquote>

This lamp really helps me feel more alert and focused in the absence of natural light. It really does what it advertises. The slim design of this lamp, I feel, is superior to the others because it is much more compact. You can easily travel with this and place it in a backpack, large purse, etc. without compromising space. Lastly, the customer service of circadian optics is amazing. If you experience any complication with the lamp whatsoever they will ship a new lamp to you without hesitation. My original lamp flickered if you lightly brushed against it. I emailed the customer service representative and they immediately shipped me a new lamp without issue. My replacement lamp works like a charm and I am very satisfied. The wonderful customer service is a great selling point. It makes the consumer feel valued and that the company cares beyond your initial investment. Wonderful company and wonderful product!"</blockquote>
