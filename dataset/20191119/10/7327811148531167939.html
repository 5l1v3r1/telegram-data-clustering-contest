      <p>UPPER EAST SIDE, Manhattan (WABC) -- After evading authorities for three months, police say a known drug dealer and speed demon is in custody after nearly running down a woman and her dog on a sidewalk.</p>
      <p>The August incident was captured by surveillance cameras.</p>
      <p>The dramatic video shows a BMW driven by 20-year-old Arfhy Santos hopping the curb at the corner of East 97th Street and Park Avenue.</p>
      <p>It happened as police were trying to stop him for the sale of two kilos of fake cocaine.</p>
      <p>Police say Santos hit an emergency vehicle that was stopped and nearly hit a woman walking her dog on the sidewalk.</p>
      <p>Santos, known on the street as "Coyote," was arrested Monday coming out of a nightclub in the Bronx.</p>
      <p>Investigators say he was in possession of three pounds of marijuana.</p>
      <p>He had just served a 9-month sentence for racing his car through Times Square nearly 2 years ago, hitting a police officer multiple times.</p>
      <p>Santos now faces multiple charges for the August incident.</p>
      <p>He is due in court later on Tuesday.</p>
