      <p>The government has declared the famous and pristine Paradise Beach near Chunnambar boathouse a ‘no plastic’ zone.</p>
      <p>District Collector T. Arun in an order on Monday directed Managing Director of Pondicherry Tourism Development Corporation to restrict the use and sale of plastic items. The beach has become one of the most sough- after tourist spots in the Union Territory.</p>
      <p>The increasing use of plastic on the beach has become a threat to marine ecology, besides affecting the aesthetic environment of the surrounding, the order said. “It is pertinent to mention that the plastic waste getting into the sea cause disturbing impact on marine species and animals. The entire marine ecology is highly susceptible to plastic waste and thereby prompting preventive action.” Mr Arun said.</p>
      <p>Any person found violating the order will be prosecuted under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, he said in the order.</p>
