        <b>Mark Selby took over six minutes to play a shot in the Northern Ireland Open quarter-final last week and he canâ€™t believe he is still having to hear about it, as World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn weighs in on the â€˜controversyâ€™.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The world number six was embroiled in a tense contest with John Higgins in Belfast, 4-2 behind but with a lead in the seventh frame when he was left with a tricky decision on a red.</p>
      <p>Selby admitted that he was â€˜over-thinkingâ€™ the shot as he took six minutes and 13 seconds to eventually take on a long red, which he missed.</p>
      <p>The Jester from Leicester went on to narrowly lose the match 5-4, finishing with a perfectly acceptable average shot time of 24.3 seconds.</p>
      <p>The three-time world champion will have been disappointed with the defeat, but is now just baffled with how much â€˜furoreâ€™ has been caused by his lengthy shot.</p>

      <p>â€˜I absolutely love it how I made more headlines here for one shot than I did for winning 3world titles ðŸ˜ƒ #headliner,â€™ tweeted Selby.</p>

      <p>The 36-year-old has taken it all in good spirits, though, as he was happy to keep the jokes coming with a number of other tweets.</p>
      <p>â€˜Congratulations to @judd147t I must say I had to switch off tho in the semi final when he was 3-2 down against Higgins he was averaging 27secs a shot. I can not be watching that #slowplay</p>
      <p>â€˜Just drove to the club and it took me 6mins 13secs a bit of a coincidence #justsayingâ€™</p>
      <p>Selby also posted a picture of a straightforward shot from practice, asking commentator Neal Foulds if he had any tips for him, after the former world number three described his six minnute shot as â€˜stupidâ€™.</p>
      <p>â€˜Iâ€™m 5 minutes in and still donâ€™t know what to play! Any clues @fouldsy147 @WorldSnookerâ€™</p>

      <p>Northern Ireland Open broadcasters Eurosport also chimed in on the situation by posting a video of Selbyâ€™s ponderous shot alongside footage of Ronnie Oâ€™Sullivanâ€™s maximum 147 break in the 1997 World Championship, which took just five minutes, eight seconds.</p>

      <p>World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn has had his say on the incident, which he says he â€˜doesnâ€™t want to see againâ€™ but accepts that Selby is not usually guilty of slow play and it was a one-off.</p>
      <p>â€˜I donâ€™t want to see a player given that long over a shot again at the UK Championship,â€™ Hearn told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-7695605/Barry-Hearn-insists-no-repeat-Mark-Selbys-six-minute-shot-UK-Championship.html">Hector Nunns for the Daily Mail.</a></p>
      <p>â€˜Six minutes is a hell of a long time, unbelievable really as there are only so many computations.</p>
      <p>â€˜Mark himself said he was guilty of over-thinking the shot, and he has summed that up pretty well.</p>
      <p>â€˜But I would like to think the referee after a reasonable amount of time on any difficult shot should make a point of saying something. Six minutes is too long.</p>
      <p>â€˜I would add I am less concerned in principle over one shot or one frame â€“ and more bothered with consistent offending.â€™</p>
      <p>Selby will be back in action at the UK Championship which begins on 26 November in York.</p>
