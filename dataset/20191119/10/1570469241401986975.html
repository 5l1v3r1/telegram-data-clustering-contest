      <p>A heavy deployment of Lebanese security forces fanned out in central Beirut on Tuesday, ahead of a parliamentary session protesters have vowed to prevent as they demonstrate against the ruling elite.</p>
      <p>Banks reopened for the first time in a week after announcing temporary steps, such as a weekly cap of $1,000 on withdrawals of hard currency and transfers abroad limited to urgent personal expenses, in moves to prevent capital flight.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/lebanon-is-a-sinking-ship-parliament-speaker-warns-262944">Lebanon</a> is in serious political and economic crisis a month after nationwide protests began. There is no indication of its leaders agreeing on a <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/lebanon-slides-deeper-into-chaos-no-sign-of-new-government-261811">new government</a> to replace the outgoing cabinet of Saad al-Hariri, who quit as premier on October 29.</p>
      <p>Riot police scuffled with a group of protesters who were trying to use a cable to remove a barbed-wire barricade blocking a road near parliament, a Reuters witness said.</p>
      <p>The protests have been fuelled by perceptions of corruption among the sectarian politicians who have governed<a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/crisis-swept-lebanon-in-gridlock-after-safadi-withdrawal-262758"> Lebanon</a> for decades and are blamed for leading the country into its worst economic crisis since the 1975-90 civil war.</p>
      <p>"How are they holding a session and not responding to the people? Those (MPs) that are in the session have nothing to do with us, and it's not what we asked for," said a protester who gave her name as Maria.</p>
      <p>The parliamentary session was originally scheduled for last week but was postponed by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri for security considerations.</p>
      <p>The agenda includes a proposal for a general amnesty that could lead to the release of several thousand prisoners. However, with several large parties opposed to the law, it was not immediately clear if it would pass.</p>
