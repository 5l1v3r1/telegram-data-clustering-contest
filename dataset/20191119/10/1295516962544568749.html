      <p>As the two-year anniversary of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/justice-league-film/">Justice League</a>'s release arrived, plenty of actors lent their support to the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement on social media. Stars <a href="https://www.cbr.com/justice-leagues-ray-fisher-supports-snyder-cut/">Ray Fisher</a>, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/wonder-womans-gal-gadot-releasethesnydercut/">Gal Gadot</a>, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/ben-affleck-batman-justice-league-snyder-cut-tweet/">Ben Affleck</a> and <a href="https://www.cbr.com/justice-league-deathstroke-release-the-snyder-cut/">Joe Manganiello</a> offered support for the release of Zack Snyder's original version of the film. Even Warner Bros.' former president recently backed the movement.</p>
      <p>And now, the <i>Justice League</i> stunt team has also offered their support of the Zack Snyder cut by releasing an epic fight choreography video from the DC movie.</p>

      <p>The video, which was originally shared on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5A9psrD28C/">Instagram</a>, came with the caption: "Ideas, concepts, pitches...some may make it some don’t. Right direction or the wrong direction, you have to start with a direction. With a fight team and creators of myself, Mike Lambert and Matt Rugetti here is little behind the scenes of a reality that could have existed."</p>

      <p>Despite the outpouring of support from <a href="https://screenrant.com/justice-league-movie-snyder-cut-dceu-critics/">Justice League</a>'s cast and crew, Warner Bros. currently has <a href="https://www.cbr.com/justice-league-snyder-cut-warner-bros-no-plans/">no plans to release Snyder's cut of the film</a>.</p>
