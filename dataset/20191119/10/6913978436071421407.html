      <p><b>BEIJING - </b>China insisted Tuesday it alone held the authority to rule on constitutional matters in Hong Kong, as it condemned a decision by the city's high court to overturn a ban on face masks worn by pro-democracy protesters.<br/><br/>The statement raised hackles among activists in Hong Kong after months of violent protests over concerns that Beijing is chipping away at the autonomy of the financial hub.<br/><br/>The ban on face-covering came into force in October, when the city's unelected pro-Beijing leader invoked colonial-era legislation for the first time in more than 50 years.<br/><br/>The move was seen as a watershed legal moment for the city since its 1997 return by Britain to China -- but has been largely symbolic.<br/><br/>The city's high court ruled on Monday that the government ban on face masks was unconstitutional. But Beijing said the judicial branch of the special administrative region had overreached.<br/><br/>Zang Tiewei, a spokesman of the National People's Congress, said only the legislature had the right to rule on whether a law is in accordance with the Basic Law -- the city's mini-constitution.<br/><br/>"No other institution has the right to make judgements or decisions," Zang said, according to a state media report posted on the NPC's website.<br/><br/>He said the ruling had "severely weakened the governance" of Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam and the city government.<br/><br/>Zang also indicated that the legislature might take some form of action.<br/><br/>"We are considering the relevant opinions and suggestions put forward by some NPC deputies," he said, without elaborating.<br/><br/>Protests started in June as a peaceful condemnation of a now-shelved China extradition bill, but have morphed into a battle to defend unique freedoms unseen on the mainland, which include freedom of speech and an independent judiciary.<br/><br/>Dennis Kwok, a pro-democracy lawmaker, warned that taking away the power of the courts in Hong Kong "will be the end of one country, two systems" -- the policy that governs the city.<br/><br/>"This is not a time to burn down your own house or to destroy the rule of law in Hong Kong," Kwok said.<br/><br/>"Respect the courts in Hong Kong, respect our system and this is the essence of the one country two systems."<br/><br/>On Twitter, democracy activist Joshua Wong saw the NPC statement as a warning that it would reinterpret Hong Kong's constitution.<br/><br/>"When the state loses, she changes the rules of game. Beijing never intends to play by the rules," Wong said. -AFP</p>
