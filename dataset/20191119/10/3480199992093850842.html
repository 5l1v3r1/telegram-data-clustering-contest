      <p>Deeney missed two games through the illness – back-to-back defeats against Boston and Curzon Ashton – but returned to put in a ‘wonderful’ performance, according to Cowan, in the 2-2 draw with high-flying Spennymoor.</p>
      <p>The Bucks chief revealed club staff were concerned about the midfielder’s well-being after the 4-1 win over Guiseley exactly a month ago.</p>
      <p>“What I would say is the midfield were just awesome,” said Cowan. “Ellis was re-energised. Supporters won’t know this but Ellis has been suffering from three or four weeks with quite a bad bug.</p>
      <p>“He probably played a couple of games where he was under the weather but didn’t want to come out because he has that loyalty to his team-mates.</p>
      <p>“But he’s back at it and it’s great to have him back to full health and fitness.</p>
      <p>“I think the last game he played was Guiseley, where he played well, and afterwards he came in to the physio room and was really struggling.</p>
      <p>“Something wasn’t quite right with fatigue, we were concerned for a while. But we got over a couple of weeks and he’s come back all clears. Everybody is happy. Credit to Ellis, he put in quite a wonderful performance.”</p>
      <p>Deeney, 28, has made 72 appearances in his two years at Telford, and wore the captain’s armband in place of Shane Sutton against the Moors.</p>
