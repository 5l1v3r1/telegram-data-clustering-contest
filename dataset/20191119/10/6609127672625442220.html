      <p>Both Grant and Stewart were guests on the BBC Scotland <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0079g4q">Sportsound</a> show where the bust-up occurred live on-air.</p>
      <p>SunSport columnist Stewart had previously claimed that <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> star Griffiths had come under intense criticism from Scotland staff during McLeish's time in charge of the national team.</p>
      <p>But former Scotland assistant and Celtic player Grant slammed the comments on-air, he said: "I think I said it to Michael. I'd never say it by text or phone.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to say it face to face and I was fortunate enough to see him a couple of weeks ago.</p>

      <p>"It was a total lie and I was always led to believe if you are not 100 per cent sure, don't go with what someone else has said, make sure you find out the truth first before you say anything.</p>
      <p>"I said to Michael and that was it, the end for me because it was a complete and utter lie. It wasn't the fact that he said it, it was the fact that everybody wrote it afterwards.</p>
      <p>"Michael said Griffiths had been slaughtered by the staff, that was the words that were used I think."</p>
      <p>Stewart replied: "Peter brought it up at a Ladbrokes event. I didn't respond due to the fact that he brought it up in front of other people so I appreciate he didn't do it over the phone or a text, but to bring it up in front of some other people who had absolutely no idea what the conversation was about, I decided not to get involved.</p>
      <p>"There's a big difference between telling lies and I'm quite interested to hear him there say you shouldn't say something unless you are 100 percent sure, I'm not a journalist and would never claim to be a journalist but in the journalistic handbook, if you hear something from two independent sources that is confirmation of a story and that is what happened.</p>

      <p>"I heard days after that something had happened in the changing room, that Leigh Griffiths had been slaughtered. I then thought nothing of it.</p>
      <p>"Then about three weeks later when there was talk of Griffiths not wanting to be in the squad, I was talking to somebody else and completely unprompted they told me again that something happened in the changing room.</p>
      <p>"This is not me fabricating a story, if that was the case I'd hold up my hands and apologise but if I'm recanting a story that two independent sources have told me then that's not a slight on my character and that's what I take umbrage with.</p>
      <p>"When Peter said, 'Michael told lies', he was using it to undermine my opinion on the show about Craig Levein.</p>
      <p>"Now everybody knows I was open and honest about what I thought of  Levein.</p>
      <p>"I didn't like the guy personally but I offered my professional assessment.</p>
      <p>"Me being honest about that undermined my professional assessment with a lot of people but that was me being honest. I could have lied and tried to hide that but I didn't.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't a lie, if it didn't happen...well it's not a lie Peter, you're rolling your eyes there, it's not a lie."</p>
      <p>The heated debate continued to unfold as Wasps boss Grant accused Stewart of malicious intent with his comments about the situation.</p>
      <p>Grant said: "Yes. I think it was.</p>
      <p>"If it didn't happen and you said it, it is a lie. Why come out and say it?"</p>
      <p>"I said you lied because you did lie.</p>
      <p>"I've worked with you on the TV and we got on fantastically well and I'm thinking, 'Why did he not phone me?'.</p>
      <p>"A problem with Leigh Griffiths in the dressing room? Michael, don't even go there."</p>
      <p>Stewart then explained he was simply giving his professional opinion and assessment when discussing Scotland and Alex McLeish matters before the subject was dropped.</p>
