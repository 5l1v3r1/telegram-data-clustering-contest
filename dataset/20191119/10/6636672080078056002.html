      <p>This is claimed to be the world’s first service bureau for 3D printing of electronics, by Isreal-based Nano Dimension, whihc has provided the two DragonFly printers that Accucode will be using.</p>

      <p>“With the DragonFly system’s ability to 3D print conductive metal and polymer simultaneously with precision, the service bureau will provide a production solution to produce one-off functional boards and test them quickly,” according to Nano Dimension. “The solution also allows experimentation with unique designs that are not constrained by traditional PCB manufacturing processes.”</p>

      <p>Services offered include integrated functionality such as PCBs with side-mounted (photo right) and inserted components, functional capacitors, vertically stacked integrated circuits (below left), dc-dc power converters, antennas and RF devices – from one-offs to thousands, said Accucode.</p>

      <p>“We have seen increasing growth in the number of businesses looking for functional electrical prototyping and manufacturing solutions,” said <a href="https://accucode3d.com/">Accucode 3D</a> CEO Debra Wilcox, CEO of Accucode 3D and The 3D Printing Store. “We are excited about the prototyping and manufacturing options the DragonFly technology offers customers across aerospace, telecom, consumer electronics, and IoT devices.”</p>
      <p>Accucode 3D parent company Accucode also has a centre in Ireland, but without a DragonFly printer.</p>
