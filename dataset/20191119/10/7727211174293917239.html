      <h1>Primark's drink trolley that's identical to designer for £360 less is back in stock in Liverpool</h1>
      <h2>Fans have been desperate for Primark to restock the item</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:33:01+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/catherine-murphy/" target="_blank">Catherine Murphy</a></address>
      <p>Primark has announced its drinks trolley is finally back in selected stores - and Liverpool is one of them.</p>
      <p>For anyone not familiar with the drinks trolley, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/primark-drinks-trolley-almost-identical-17033711">it was initially released last month and sold out instantly</a> after fans spotted it was practically identical to a designer one, but for much less.</p>
      <p>The drinks trolley (or cart depending on what you prefer to call it) looks just like one by Oliver Bonas - for £360 less.</p>
      <p>Taking to its Instagram feed, Primark announced the news on both its home account and its clothing one.</p>

      <p>Oliver Bonas’ is similar in design, with its round shape and colour, though it does have more levels in the middle and doesn’t have a handle.</p>
      <p>The design sold by Oliver Bonas, which  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/oliver-bonas-set-open-new-16531785">recently opened a store at Liverpool ONE</a>  , costs £395, while Primark’s trolley comes in at £30.</p>
