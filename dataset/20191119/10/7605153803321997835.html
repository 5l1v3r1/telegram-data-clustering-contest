        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 19 – The bout between Africa Games bronze medallist Elly Ajowi of the National Police Service and Kibra’s Joshua Wasike headline the fifth and final leg of the Boxing Federation of Kenya (BFK) contest to take place in Kisumu starting Thursday to Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The league dubbed “Road to Tokyo” will be used to select team Kenya’s provisional squad for the 2020 Olympics.</p>
      <p>“Boxing Federation of Kenya will be having an open boxing selection as it used to be in earlier years. There will be no boardroom selection. All international boxers to take part in the final league in Kisumu have no choice but to prove their worth,” BFK Technical Delegate Albert Matito said.</p>
      <p>National team coach Musa Benjamin said the team for Olympic qualifiers will be shortlisted after the League in Kisumu.</p>
      <p>“A provisional team will be named to start preparations for the African qualifiers set for Senegal early next year,” Musa stated.</p>
      <p>Also, in action will be Olympian Elizabeth Andiego who will face Metrine Sagina of Trans Nzoia in the women’s category.</p>
      <p>Ajowi suffered a shock semifinal defeat at the hands of Kibra’s Wasike with the latter bantering over who will kiss the canvas first on Kisumu leg.</p>

      <p>Africa Games silver medallist, Shaffi Bakari also suffered a semi-final defeat to Mohammed Hussein of Kibra.</p>
      <p>Shaffi fought with a recurring injury he sustained in Morocco while Ajowi looked quite unfit and ill prepared on his fight against Wasike.</p>
      <p>The 60kg lightweight class also has unfinished business with Benson Kamau of Nairobi looking to repeat his victory against international Ethan Maina of National Police Service.</p>
      <p>The 52Kgs flyweight apart from the Bakari’s intended comeback will showcase another unfinished business between Kevin Maina of Kenya Defence Forces against Mohamed Hussein of Kibra.</p>
      <p>The two played in the final of the last leg with Maina emerging the winner in a potentially explosive fight.</p>
      <p>The women’s fight has attracted the likes of Gold Coast bronze medalist Christine Ongare who will be up against Siaya namesake Christine Aluoch in flyweight.</p>
