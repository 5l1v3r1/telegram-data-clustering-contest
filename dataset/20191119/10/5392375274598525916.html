      <p>Chinese manufacturing giant, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/huawei">Huawei</a>, will certainly release the Huawei P40 series next year. However, there are reports that this flagship series may come in early 2020. As of now, the Huawei Mate 30 series is not widely available outside China for obvious reasons. Thus, there were speculations that Huawei may delay the arrival of the P40 series. Nevertheless, it appears that the company does not want its setback with Google to alter its phone release calendar.</p>

      <p>For most technology vendors, there are two excellent exhibition windows in the first quarter of 2020. One is CES 2020 which starts on January 7 while the other is MWC 2020 which commences on February 24. Given the time frame, CES 2020 seems to be too early for the release of the P40 series. The end of January is also ruled out due to the Lunar New Year’s Day. If Huawei will release this series in Q1 2020, it should be from mid-February and before MWC 2020.</p>
      <p>Let’s not forget that the Mate 30 series comes without Google Mobile Services (GMS). If everything remains the same by the end of the year, then the P40 series will also not use GMS. On paper, there are reports that Huawei is confident that the content of the ban will gradually weaken. It is also possible that Huawei has decided to spare no effort to promote HMS (Huawei Mobile Services).</p>
