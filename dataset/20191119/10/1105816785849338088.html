      <p>An Indian politician, Vijay Jolly, was removed by security officials at the second Asia Pacific Summit emerged on Tuesday after he rudely interrupted an address by National Assembly Deputy Speaker Qasim Sure.</p>
      <p>Jolly is associated with the ruling right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p>
      <p>Suri was raising the plight of Kashmiris in his address, when the Indian politician got up and interrupted him.</p>

      <p>In the video, Jolly can be seen gesturing to Suri and saying: “I voice my protest…Jammu and Kashmir is not a part of this summit…How can he say this. This is wrong, he cannot say this is a human rights violation”.</p>

      <p>A voice in the crowd replies to him saying, “No let him speak”.</p>
      <p>Jolly was then forcibly removed by security from the event.</p>
      <p>The video soon began doing the rounds on Twitter with users lambasting the Indian official over trying to prevent Suri from raising the Kashmir issue at the summit.</p>
      <p>Over 860 delegates from 40 countries attended the second edition of the intercontinental summit.</p>
      <p>This year’s theme is addressing critical challenges: peace, reconciliation, interdependence, mutual prosperity and universal value.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time an Indian politician has embarrassed New Delhi on the international stage. Earlier on November 17, former Indian military general Maj Gen (R) SP Sinha screamed that “<i>Maut ke badle maut</i> [death for death], <i>balatkar ke badle balatkar</i> [rape for rape] during a high-decibel debate on the Kashmiri Pandit exodus on <i>TV 9 Bharatvarsh.</i></p>
