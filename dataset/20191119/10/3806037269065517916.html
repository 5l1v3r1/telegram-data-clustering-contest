      <h2>Following the success of Netflix biopic ‘The Dirt.’</h2>

      <p>Back in February, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/netflix">Netflix</a> released the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/2/motley-crue-biopic-the-dirt-trailer-release">Mötley Crüe biopic <i>The Dirt</i></a>, which shines a light on the incredible rise of the ’80s rock band as well as its dramatic affairs. According to a recent statement, however, after witnessing the success of the movie, the band has decided to reunite, destroying the “cessation of touring contract” which prevented them from playing together. The band’s last show was supposed to be the one at the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/Staples-Center">Staples Center</a> back in December 31, 2015 as part of the “Final Tour.”</p>
      <p>The statement details how the band has gotten rid of the hindering contract because of “a whole new generation of Crüeheads” wanting the band to get back together. It also addresses how the band members parted ways but reconciled with each other as they helped in the development of <i>The Dirt</i>. To go with the statement, the band has released a video that shows the contract being blown into smithereens in a symbolic explosion. News of the band’s reunion also comes with a report from <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/rolling-stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> that Mötley Crüe will also be touring with Poison and Def Leppard. So far, there isn’t much information out there on when those exact dates will be, except that the tour is projected for 2020.</p>
