      <p>Glastonbury and McCartney's representatives were not immediately available for further comment.</p>
      <p>Tickets for the 2020 event went on sale in October and were sold out in just over half an hour, according to the festival's <a href="https://cdn.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/">website</a>.</p>
      <p>Glastonbury Festival was founded by farmer Michael Eavis, 83, and his late wife Jean in 1970, after they were inspired by the Bath Festival of Blues. Marc Bolan played the first event, which had an entry charge of 1 pound with free milk included.Â </p>
