      <p>Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has appointed a U.S.-born lawyer of Ukrainian descent as an adviser with a mandate to build relations with ethnic Ukrainians living in the United States.</p>
      <p>Zelensky named Andrew Mac, who heads the law office of Asters in Washington, as an adviser on November 5, according to a brief statement on the president's website, Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty (<a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/zelenskiy-appoints-u-s-lawyer-as-adviser-amid-outreach-to-ukrainian-diaspora/30278949.html">RFE/RL) reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Mac gave more details about his role in two November 14 <a href="https://efile.fara.gov/docs/6750-Exhibit-AB-20191114-2.pdf">foreign-agent registration filings</a> with the U.S. Justice Department.</p>
      <p>"The registrant participates in conferences and other engagements in his personal capacity that promote ties between Ukraine and the Ukrainian-American community and American investment in Ukraine which may indirectly benefit the president of Ukraine," <a href="https://efile.fara.gov/docs/6750-Registration-Statement-20191114-1.pdf">one filing says</a>.</p>
      <p>Mac's tenure is for an indefinite period and he will not be paid for his services, the filing said.</p>
      <p>Mac's appointment comes as Ukraine's reputation in the United States has taken a hit amid a Democratic-led impeachment hearing into whether President Donald Trump withheld military aid to the country in order to pressure its government to conduct investigations into a potential rival for the 2020 presidential election.</p>
      <p>Republicans have sought to defend Trump in part by casting Ukraine as one of the world's most corrupt countries, RFE/RL said.</p>
      <p>Mac's role will "likely involve" speaking with Ukrainian-American media or media outlets read by the Ukrainian-American community, according to the filing with the Justice Department.</p>
      <p>Neither Mac nor spokespeople for Zelensky returned RFE/RL's calls for comment.</p>
      <p>"Fighting the perception that Ukraine is corrupt is probably going to be part of his portfolio," said Andrij Dobriansky, director of communications for the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America.</p>
      <p>There are more than 1 million Americans that identify as Ukrainian, he said.</p>
      <p>However, Mac's main role will more likely focus on promoting Ukraine as a place to do business, Dobriansky said. "President Zelensky's goal is to grow the economy, as he has very concrete budgetary concerns," he said.</p>
      <p>Mac specializes in cross-border transactions involving the United States, Ukraine, and other former Soviet states, according to a biography on Asters' <a href="https://www.asterslaw.com/our_team/mac/">website</a>.</p>
      <p>Mac, born in New York City and raised in the Philadelphia area, is a member of the Ukrainian diaspora, according to the Kyiv Post.</p>
