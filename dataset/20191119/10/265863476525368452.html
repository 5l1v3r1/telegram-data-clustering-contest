      <p>According to recent rumors, singer and businessman Ray J was accused of cheating on his wife and mother of his child, Princess Love.</p>
      <p>The <i>Love &amp; Hip Hop: Hollywood</i> star was caught snuggling with another woman at colleague Drake’s birthday party.</p>

      <p>Ray J reportedly was having quite a lovely time celebrating Drake’s birthday in L.A. and even if at first he was behaving innocently, he was soon flirting with an unknown girl at the party and also got her number.</p>

      <p>Following what happened, a lot of people now believe it is not a pure coincidence that Ray J is not going to attend to his gig, as new information revealed that he backed out of his <i>TB</i> tour recently.</p>
      <p>For many, the reality star will miss the opportunity to perform alongside fellows Immature, B5, Holiday, and Day 26 for their collaboration that was set to begin on the 2nd of November.</p>

      <p>In an official press release, it became known that Ray J could devote more time to his wife in this special moment when he and Princess Love are expecting their second child — she is almost there.</p>
      <p>The star shared the news about the newest member of his family himself when she posted a message on Instagram back in August. The excited father wrote in the caption, “Baby #2 on the way!,” on his personal page.</p>
