        <b>Former England captain Dylan Hartley says he felt "fraudulent" being sidelined by a long-term knee injury that eventually led to his retirement.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ex-Northampton hooker <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/50332937">called time on his career</a> this month, having not played since December 2018.</p>
      <p>Hartley, 33, says he hoped to return for the World Cup in Japan and got "worn down" by having to keep delaying his comeback from injury.</p>
      <p>"I got sick of saying the same old line," said Hartley</p>
      <p>"People were asking 'when are you going to play again?' and I was going 'err, about six weeks'. Two weeks later someone asks and I say 'about six weeks'.</p>
      <p>"In the end I just got worn down by it and realised I had probably had enough. So I just called it."</p>
      <p>Hartley, who won 97 Test caps and played 251 times for Northampton over 14 seasons, injured his knee in a mach against Worcester Warriors on 21 December last year.</p>
      <p>"Once that World Cup dream went out the window and I wasn't getting the progress from my knee I wanted, I was thinking 'why do I keep pressing to play a handful of games for Northampton?'" he told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07vcpwv">Rugby Union Weekly podcast.</a></p>
      <p>"I couldn't put a return date on it. You start feeling fraudulent.</p>
      <p>"I was thinking I needed to play pretty soon and couldn't see myself playing within the next month or so."</p>
      <p>Hartley, who skippered England to a Six Nations Grand Slam in 2016 and won the Six Nations again the following year, says the decision to retire was a "weight off the shoulders".</p>
      <p>He is currently working with the hookers at Northampton and helping to mentor players, and says he has thought about careers in coaching or the media.</p>
      <p>"It's liberating," he added. "I am having a bit of down time. Christmas is something we don't know how to enjoy as players.</p>
      <p>"I would like to have some time away from it all and think about what I want to do."</p>
