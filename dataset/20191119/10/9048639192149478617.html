      <p><b>(CNN) - </b>A vegan has filed a lawsuit against Burger King over its Impossible Whopper, claiming it's falsely promoted as meat-free.</p>
      <p>The proposed class action lawsuit says they're cooked on the same grill as regular burgers, so they're contaminated with meat byproducts.</p>
      <p>The suit was filed by Philip Williams on behalf of other vegans.</p>
      <p>It accuses Burger King of deceptive practices by not disclosing they're cooked on the same grill.</p>
      <p>He says he wouldn't have paid a premium price for one at an Atlanta location if he'd known.</p>
      <p>Burger King's online menu says the Impossible Whopper is "zero percent beef" and says "for guests looking for a meat-free option, a non-broiler method of preparation is available upon request."</p>
      <p>The suit seeks compensation for everyone who bought the burger and for Burger King to clearly disclose on the menu that they use the same grill for all burgers.</p>
      <p>Burger King told news outlets it does not comment on pending litigation.</p>
