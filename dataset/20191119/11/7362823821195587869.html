      <h1>Houston Astros World Series DVD may show team's alleged cheating setup</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:21:25+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:21</time> by <a rel="author">Ryan Gaydos</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/houston-astros">Houston Astros</a>, embroiled in a cheating scandal, may have tipped their own hand in the team's 2017 DVD commemorating their first World Series championship.</p>
      <p>The team has already been <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/sports/astros-sign-stealing-investigation-video-footage">accused of setting up</a> a camera in centerfield to relay a catcher’s signs to a television in the clubhouse and then signal to the batter when an off-speed pitch was coming. On Sunday, the Twitter user known as Jomboy – <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/astros-video-sign-stealing-allegations-2017">who already uncovered peculiar noises</a> coming from the Astros dugout on off-speed pitches – again brought to light the team’s alleged cheating setup.</p>

          <b>HOUSTON ASTROS SIGN-STEALING CASE UNLIKELY TO HURT BOTTOM LINE</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Video from the team’s championship DVD allegedly shows where the Astros employees would tip batters. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/carlos-correa">Carlos Correa</a> comes down from the dugout and to his right you can see a trash can, a table, a few chairs and a cable. The setup is still there when <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/alex-bregman">Alex Bregman</a> runs through as well.</p>

      <p>Jomboy also points out another moment in the video where a team employee appears to be setting up a television on the table. However, there doesn’t appear to be anything notable being used to bang on the trash can as has been alleged in previous reports.</p>

          <b>HOUSTON ASTROS EXECUTIVE ASKED SCOUTS TO SPY ON OTHER TEAMS, REPORT SAYS</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Suspicions were raised last week when former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers, as well as other unnamed sources, told <a href="https://theathletic.com/1363451/2019/11/12/the-astros-stole-signs-electronically-in-2017-part-of-a-much-broader-issue-for-major-league-baseball/">The Athletic</a> that the Astros were alerting batters when pitchers were throwing off-speed pitches.</p>
      <p>Two sources told The Athletic that the sign-stealing extended into the postseason in 2017, but another denied it went on that long. Carlos Beltran, the team’s former designated hitter-turned-<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/new-york-mets">New York Mets</a> manager, and Alex Cora, the team’s former bench coach-turned-<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/boston-red-sox">Boston Red Sox</a> manager, were both accused of playing a “key role” in the system.</p>

      <p>Major League Baseball said it was investigating the allegations. The league had strengthened rules in 2019 in a bid to ensure teams weren’t stealing signs with the aid of technology.</p>
