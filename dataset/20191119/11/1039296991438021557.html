      <p>Maruti Suzuki has announced that it has sold 10,634 units of the S-Presso in the month of October 2019, putting the car in the list of the 10 bestselling models for the month. Maruti Suzuki has long been a dominant figure in the top 10 monthly sales charts, with models such as the Alto, Swift and Dzire having long vied for the top three positions.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, this is not the first time that the S-Presso has appeared on the monthly sales chart. <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/marutis-s-presso-is-one-of-the-bestselling-cars-in-september-2019-414579"><b>Sales for the month of September</b></a> – the car was<a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/2019-maruti-suzuki-s-presso-launched-at-rs-369-lakh-414310"><b> launched on September 30</b></a> – feature the car in eighth place, with just over 5,000 units sold in the month.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the S-Presso’s performance in the market, Shashank Srivastava, Executive Director (Marketing &amp; Sales), Maruti Suzuki India Limited, said, “Today, Indian buyers have a clear inclination towards feature-loaded, safe, comfortable and easy-to-own entry-level cars. S-Presso has been able to carve out its own niche in the entry segment. S-Presso stands apart to offer unique experiences to its distinct customers in the segment. We are enthused with the response and thank our customers for their confidence in S-Presso.”</p>
      <p>The S-Presso is Maruti’s latest budget car in the market and debuts the carmaker’s BS6-compliant, 1.0-litre, K10 petrol engine – which is set to make its way into other Maruti cars in coming months. A rival to the Renault Kwid, the S-Presso features SUV-derived styling first seen in the form of the Future S concept. The high-riding hatchback is available in a choice of four trim levels; the higher trims get the option of an AMT gearbox.</p>
