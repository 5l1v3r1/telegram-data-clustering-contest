      <h1>‘View to an exchange’ – Everton could soon be offered chance to sign out-of-sorts goalscorer</h1>

      <p>Earlier this year, Krzysztof Piatek was seen as an excellent January signing for AC Milan.</p>
      <p>Arriving from Genoa for more than €30m, he started paying the fee back quickly. By the end of February he’d scored seven goals for the Rossoneri, and finished the season with 30 goals in 42 appearances across the two clubs.</p>
      <p>This season, the 24 year old has scored three goals in 12 appearances so far, and it’s led to outright panic around the Serie A side. As <a href="https://www.calciomercato.it/news/357106/calciomercato_milan_piatek_sul_mercato_scambio_tra_attaccanti">Calciomercato.it</a> point out, there’s even been talk of a return to Genoa on loan.</p>
      <p>There’s another possible plan. The Italian website says there’s a ‘view to an exchange’ with Moise Kean at Everton, who has struggled to find time under Marco Silva since moving from Juventus in the summer window.</p>
      <p>It’s ‘not excluded’ that in the ‘coming weeks’ there could be talks about the possible swap, with Everton potentially being offered the chance to sign Piatek.</p>
      <p>In reality, it’s probably best for both clubs to have more patience with their signings, and hope they come good again before the end of the season. Should that not work then it would make more sense to talk about moves in the summer.</p>
