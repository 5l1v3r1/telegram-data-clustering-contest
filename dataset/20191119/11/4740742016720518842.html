      <h1>Bristol Bears injury news ahead of Brive: Nathan Hughes, Steven Luatua, John Afoa</h1>
      <h2>Pat Lam provides the latest updates on his squad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:02:38+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:02</time> by <a rel="author">John Evely</a></address>
      <p>Bristol Bears have suffered some high profile injuries in their 17-20 victory over Exeter Chiefs to send them top of the Gallagher Premiership.</p>
      <p>Following the physical clash at Sandy Park, the Bears confirmed John Afoa (calf), Nathan Hughes (finger) and Steven Luatua (hip) will all face a spell on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Despite the absence of the two former All Blacks and the England international, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rugby">Bristol Bears</a> had more than enough to dispatch Italian side Zebre in their opening game of the European Challenge Cup on Saturday, winning <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/rugby/match-reports/bristol-bears-zebre-live-updates-3545590">59-21 to go top of Pool Four</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking post match Bears director of rugby Pat Lam went into more detail about the nature of the injuries to three of his star players.</p>

      <h3>Nathan Hughes</h3>
      <p>Number eight Nathan Hughes dislocated his player in the Gallagher Premiership but battled through the pain to put in a stunning peformance to win the man of the match award.</p>
      <p>Lam explained: "Nathan’s finger came out of joint six times in that game against Exeter so he has had to have surgery.</p>
      <p>"It potentially could have been six to 10 weeks out but he had surgery on Thursday where they stapled the tendon back on which is great because that means he should be back by the London Irish game in a couple of weeks."</p>

      <h3>Steven Luatua</h3>
      <p>Blindside flanker Luatua was pushing Hughes for the man of the match award with a hugely inflencial performance against the Chiefs.</p>
      <p>Lam said: "He has got a hip pointer. So if this [Bristol Bears v Zebre] had been a cup final, or the last game of the season we could have pushed hard to get him out there but it’s not. Hopefully he should be available next week."</p>
      <p>The website <a href="https://www.upmc.com/services/sports-medicine/conditions/hip-pointer">UPMC Sports Medicine</a> explains exactly what the injury is. It says: 'A hip pointer is a deep bruise to the ridge of bone on the upper outside of your hip, called the iliac crest. It's often a result of a direct blow to the hip or a hard fall. Hip pointer symptoms include pain and tenderness. Recovery from the injury usually involves taking a break from activity until it heals."</p>

      <h3>John Afoa</h3>
      <p>The former All Black prop may be 36 but is in incredible shape thanks to a personalised programme of stretching which he performs.</p>
      <p>Lam said: "John Afoa has pulled his calf. That is probably a couple of weeks out. Thankfully, it is a grade one tear, which is good. We got it just at the right time and the medical team did a good job and informed me we need to get him off to avoid further injury. I said great, let’s get him off at half time and that probably helped the recovery time.</p>
      <p>"There is a good chance John will be ready for the London Irish game, if not the week after against Stade Francais."</p>

      <h3>Injury round-up</h3>
      <p>The Bears also confirmed on Friday that winger Luke Daniels will be sidelined for six months following surgery on a shoulder injury he picked up against in the 16-10 victory over Sale Sharks on November 2.</p>
      <p>The lastest confirmed unavailable players are: Shaun Malton (neck), Tom Lindsay (hamstring), John Afoa (calf), Jake Heenan (ankle), Nathan Hughes (finger), Steven Luatua (hip), Blake Boyland (ankle), Alapati Leiua (knee), Jack Bates (hamstring) and Luke Daniels (shoulder).</p>
      <p>The good news is number eight Jordan Crane is not on that list any more, with Lam saying a couple of weeks ago that the former England man is the next of the rank to return to play, which will come as a welcome boost with Hughes recovering from his minor surgery. Short term signing Luke Hamilton started at eight for Bristol on Saturday.</p>
