      <p>This three-ingredient tomato soup from Sarah Adler's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simply-Real-Eating-Everyday-Recipes/dp/1682684113/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?tag=mind0a3-20"><i>Simply Real Eating</i></a><i> </i>is the definition of the simple pleasures in life. "Feel free to add your own additions as you have time," Adler writes. "Such as some <a href="https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-22062/why-you-should-be-eating-more-garlic.html">extra garlic</a> to the roasting process; some <a href="https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/the-side-effects-of-holy-basil-you-may-not-know-about-seo">basil</a> into the purée; or pulled chicken, organic sausage, or <a href="https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-25572/6-things-you-never-knew-about-your-favorite-leafy-green.html">spinach</a> to serve."</p>
      <p>The three magic ingredients include tomatoes, <a href="https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-13497/detox-like-a-french-woman-with-this-delicious-slimming-vegetable-soup.html">leeks</a>, and chicken stock. Plus the spices and olive oil for roasting, that's all you need for a warming and flavorful fall soup. It's so <a href="https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-21685/11-quinoa-bowls-that-make-it-easy-and-delicious-to-eat-clean.html">easy to make</a>, you'll want to have it on hand all season long.</p>
