      <h1>Players from first-ever India, Bangladesh Test to attend Day/Night clash at Eden Gardens</h1>
      <h2>Sourav Ganguly confirmed that players from the first-ever Test played between India and Bangladesh in November 2000 will be present at the Eden Gardens Stadium on Saturday, as India prepare to host its first-ever Day/Night Test. </h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:34:58+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/sports-desk/" target="_blank">Sports Desk</a></address>
      <p>The newly-appointed Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sourav-ganguly/">Sourav Ganguly</a> confirmed that players from the first-ever Test played between India and Bangladesh in November 2000 will be present at the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/eden-gardens-kolkata-history-day-night-test-mecca-of-indian-cricket-6125846/">Eden Gardens Stadium</a> on Saturday, as India prepare to host its first-ever Day/Night Test.</p>
      <p>Ganguly has also invited former Indian skippers Mohammad Azharuddin, Chandu Borde, and Nari Contractor for the historic contest. Only <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/zaheer-khan/">Zaheer Khan</a> and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/yuvraj-singh/">Yuvraj Singh</a> will not attend the event as they are currently participating in the ongoing T10 League in Dubai.</p>
      <p>“I am just overseeing the transition process. This is a special match, dignitaries are coming. Former captains are coming. The Bangladesh team who played the first Test against India in 2000 are coming. They will be felicitated. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/commonwealth-games/mary-kom-profile-boxing-biography-stats-medals-cwg-5106250/">Mary Kom</a>, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/commonwealth-games/pv-sindhu-profile-badminton-biography-stats-medals-cwg-5105924/">PV Sindhu</a>, Abhinav Bindra, Pullela Gopichand, everyone will be here. They will be felicitated,” Ganguly said in an interview with Red FM.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the clash, there have been concerns over the due factor, but the former Indian skipper ensured that the groundsmen are trying to minimise the effect. The left-handed batsman also feels that due will not majorly affect the proceedings.</p>
      <p>“Like how it’s done in One-Day cricket. In ODIs, the match goes on till later in the evening. T20I cricket starts at 8 PM and this (Test) will end by 8 PM,” Ganguly said.</p>
      <p>Ganguly also ensured that the stadium will be lit with pink lights, including the scorecard, in order to suit the theme of the contest. Not just the stadium but prominent buildings in the city will also be lighted in the same colour.</p>
      <p>Also, Ganguly has personally decided the food menu for the match as Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Bengal Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mamata-banerjee">Mamata Banerjee</a> is scheduled to attend the match.</p>
