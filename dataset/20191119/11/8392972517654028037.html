      <p>Jane McDonald has revealed she was "absolutely thrilled" to be the inspiration behind Adele Roberts' luxury item on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a>.</p>
      <p>On last night's show, Kate Garraway, Nadine Coyle, Roman Kemp, Myles Stephenson and Adele <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celeb-viewers-divided-as-adele-roberts-gets-her-luxury-item-and-others-didnt/">competed in a late night challenge to try and win all the stars' luxury items</a>.</p>
      <p>However, they only managed to retrieve two of the boxes - Adele's picture of former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/loose-women/">Loose Women</a> star Jane and Kate's concealer.</p>

      <p>After it was revealed Adele had chosen to bring a picture of Jane into the camp, the actress responded on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Jane wrote: "Absolutely thrilled to see my picture in the jungle. @AdeleRoberts I flipping love you. Best of luck #I'mACeleb."</p>
      <p>Jane also appeared on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/">This Morning</a> via a phone call and admitted she was "gobsmacked" by Adele's photo.</p>

      <p>She said: "I was absolutely gobsmacked. My phone just started going 'ding ding ding'. I just sat on the edge of the bed in my underwear and watched it on plus one.</p>
      <p>"I just thought, 'oh my goodness me.' I could not believe it."</p>
      <p>When asked if she's Adele before, Jane said: "No I've never met her but I want to now."</p>
      <p>Host <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/phillip-schofield/">Phillip Schofield</a> asked Jane whether she would go into the jungle and she replied: "Oh no I don't think so, it's not for me that love. I'd need a hairdryer and me without makeup... not attractive."</p>
      <aside>Absolutely thrilled to see my picture in the jungle.</aside>
      <p>Last night, Adele explained why she wanted to bring in a photo of Jane to camp.</p>
      <p>She said in the Bush Telegraph: "I can't believe Roman Kemp doesn't know who Jane McDonald is. I am flabbergasted.</p>
      <p>"She is a national treasure and she's the queen of Wakefield."</p>
      <p>The photo was then tied to one of the trees in camp.</p>
      <p>The picture caused a stir on Twitter, with some viewers branding Adele's luxury item "ridiculous".</p>

      <p>One said: "What a ridiculous choice of item."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "So Kate and Adele get their luxury items which was concealer and a photo of Jane McDonald and all the others didn’t and they were more important gifts? How useless."</p>
