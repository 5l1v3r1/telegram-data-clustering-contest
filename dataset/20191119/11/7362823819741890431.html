      <p>Derek Jeter led the nearly two dozen newcomers on the 2020 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb">Baseball</a> Hall of Fame ballot that was released Monday as he looks to become the newest former <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/new-york-yankees">New York Yankees</a> star in Cooperstown.</p>
      <p>Jeter, now the current <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/miami-marlins">Miami Marlins</a> CEO, is thought to have the best shot to be selected into the hallowed halls unanimously. The 14-time All-Star shortstop played 20 seasons with the Yankees, won five World Series titles, had a career batting average of .310 and recorded 3,465 hits.</p>
