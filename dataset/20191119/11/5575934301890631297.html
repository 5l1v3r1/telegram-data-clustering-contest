      <p>Iran is currently cut off from the internet following violent clashes between police and protesters.</p>
      <p>Iran’s government announced Friday that it was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-50444429">rationing fuel and increasing its price</a>, citing economic pressure US sanctions as its reason for doing so. This sent prices skyrocketing 50%, and protests quickly broke out across the country, resulting in clashes with security forces.</p>
      <p>On Saturday the government enforced an internet blackout, cutting off all but 4% of the country’s internet in an effort to curb protesters organising.</p>

      <p>Since the protests started on Friday, 12 people have been killed <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-50459971">according to the BBC</a>, although the actual figure is likely to be higher.</p>
      <p>Iran’s judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili told journalists on Tuesday that the protests had abated and “calm has been restored in the country,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-gasoline-protests/iran-says-calm-has-been-restored-after-fuel-price-hike-unrest-idUSKBN1XT0X7">according to Reuters</a> – but the internet blackout remains in place.</p>
      <p>With Iranians’ access to the internet restricted it’s hard to get a clear image of the situation, but Reuters reported that some videos uploaded to social media in spite of the ban showed protests continuing on Monday night.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time this year a government has cut off citizens’ access to the internet. India cut off internet access to the disputed region of Kashmir in <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/08/tech/kashmir-internet-blackout-india-pakistan-intl-hnk/index.html">August of this year</a>, and since that time has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/kashmir-blackout-locals-dont-know-india-revoked-autonomy-report-2019-8">axed the region’s semi-autonomous status</a>.</p>
