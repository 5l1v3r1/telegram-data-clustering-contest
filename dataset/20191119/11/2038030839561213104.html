      <p>Cape Town – The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended the Royal Variety Show on Monday, but it was Kate who really wowed in the spotlight.</p>
      <p>The Duke and Duchess attended the performance at the Palladium Theatre in London in aid of the Royal Variety Charity. The money raised will help entertainers in the UK who need financial help and assistance, according to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5BXBn_FtUN/"><b>Kensington Palace Instagram account</b></a>.</p>

      <p>The Duke and Duchess met performers of the cast of <i>Mary Poppins </i>and <i>Come From Away</i> as well as Mary Poppins, Lewis Capaldi, Mabel, Robbie Williams, while there was a special performance by Emeli Sandé and Manchester's Bee Vocal choir too. The evening was hosted by comedians Rob Beckett and Romesh Ranganathan, who cracked a few jokes about the royals out on a "date night".</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7698843/Kate-Middleton-dons-slinky-Alexander-McQueen-gown-joins-William-Royal-Variety-Performance.html"><b>Daily Mail</b></a>, Kate said though the kids would've loved to accompany their mom and dad – Charlotte, in particular, loves singing and dancing – she had to tell them, "Not on a school night."</p>
      <p>Rob and Romesh asked whether the royals paid the babysitter "until 12 or 1", joking "It's always worth £20 for the extra hour."</p>
      <p>Romesh also wondered if Their Royal Highnesses ever woke up in the morning as he did thinking, "Why did we do this?"</p>
      <p>William and Kate couldn't contain themselves in the Royal Box. It looks like it was a lovely night out on the town for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.    </p>
