      <p>The NFL Power Rankings are all about evaluating teams every week. Because we have to rank all 32, there aren't teams that fall through the cracks. That's not the case with individual players, though.</p>
      <p>Some players, no matter what they do, don't get the big headlines. Whether this player is a star who isn't fully appreciated or a role player who defers the praise to more celebrated teammates, our NFL Nation writers identified that guy on the team they cover who quietly gets the job done. Our power panel -- a group of more than 80 writers, editors and TV personalities -- evaluates how teams stack up throughout the season.</p>

      <p>Big, powerful defensive tackles who don't put up weighty sack numbers aren't often part of the postgame conversation, especially if they prefer to be under the radar with the media, such as the 6-foot-4, 315-pound Guy does. But a large part of the success of the Patriots' defense, which is the backbone of this year's team, is Guy's unsung work at the line of scrimmage -- particularly against the run. He also tallied his first career interception earlier this season on an exemplary play. -- <i>Mike Reiss</i></p>

      <p><b>Most underrated player:</b> <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/2574591/nick-boyle">Nick Boyle</a>, TE</p>
      <p>Boyle often takes a backseat to the Ravens' pass-catching tight ends -- <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116365/mark-andrews">Mark Andrews</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3924365/hayden-hurst">Hayden Hurst</a> -- with fans. But Boyle is the NFL's top blocking tight end and a major reason Baltimore has rushed for 2,038 yards -- the most by any team in its first 10 games of a season since the 1977 Bears. "We all know how valuable he is," Andrews said. "He's basically what makes this offense tick." -- <i>Jamison Hensley</i></p>

      <p>The diminutive Williams is a favorite in the Niners locker room for playing much bigger than his 5-foot-9, 185-pound frame would suggest. Williams is one of just three defensive backs with at least one sack, two forced fumbles and two interceptions through the first 11 weeks. "We call him the Shark for a reason, because he's just out there tearing everything up in sight," Niners linebacker <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3138826/fred-warner">Fred Warner</a> said. "He kind of is the whole package and an outstanding player for sure." -- <i>Nick Wagoner</i></p>

      <p><b>Most underrated player:</b> <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054026/shaquill-griffin">Shaquill Griffin</a>, CB</p>
      <p>Of all the issues the Seahawks have had on defense, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/story/_/id/28054374/new-diet-new-mindset-shaquill-griffin-breakout-season">Griffin has not been one of them</a>. His 11 pass breakups are tied for the league lead among defensive backs, per ESPN charting. He has allowed a passer rating of 75.9 when he has been the nearest defender in coverage, per NFL Next Gen Stats. That's eighth-best among DBs with at least 50 targets. Griffin will have a hard time making the Pro Bowl unless he starts picking off some passes, but he is otherwise playing at that level. -- <i>Brady Henderson</i></p>

      <p><b>Most underrated player:</b> <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115485/elgton-jenkins">Elgton Jenkins</a>, LG</p>
      <p>The second-round pick ranks fourth among all NFL linemen in ESPN's pass block win rate at 97.3%, which also is second among all guards. The rookie trails NFL leader and fellow Packer <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/16864/corey-linsley">Corey Linsley</a>, who was probably second choice for this write-up. Jenkins took over as a starter in Week 3 after left guard <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/16549/lane-taylor">Lane Taylor</a> suffered a torn biceps but would've done so eventually even without an injury to Taylor. "There's been so much good, both in the run and the pass," Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. "But what I love about Elgton is the consistency and the level of effort that he brings each and every day on every play." -- <i>Rob Demovsky</i></p>

      <p><b>Most underrated player:</b> <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/14958/demario-davis">Demario Davis</a>, LB</p>
      <p>The eighth-year veteran has never made a Pro Bowl. But he is working on his third straight season of at least 110 tackles. Since he arrived as a free agent last year, the Saints have had the NFL's No. 1 run defense (allowing just 82.2 rushing yards per game over the past two seasons). Throw in everything Davis does as a captain, emotional leader and signal-caller wearing the defensive headset and he might be the Saints' best free-agent signing in a decade. -- <i>Mike Triplett</i></p>

      <p><b>Most underrated player:</b> <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045130/jayron-kearse">Jayron Kearse</a>, S</p>
      <p>In back-to-back weeks, Kearse has been credited with making the final play of the game to seal victories. He picked off <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577417/dak-prescott">Dak Prescott</a>'s Hail Mary attempt last week and <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/story/_/id/28102822/vikings-make-rare-20-point-comeback-half">broke up a pass in the end zone</a> as time expired on Sunday against the Broncos. Kearse's playing time has fluctuated, and the return of <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/13939/andrew-sendejo">Andrew Sendejo</a> puts the 6-foot-4 safety's role in question. Still, when <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/14945/harrison-smith">Harrison Smith</a> sustained a hamstring injury late against Denver, Vikings coaches trusted Kearse to cover tight end <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/4036131/noah-fant">Noah Fant</a> in the ultimate "got to have it" situation. Coming through in these moments cements Kearse's importance in the secondary. -- <i>Courtney Cronin</i></p>

      <p>Sherman doesn't play much on offense, but there's a reason the Chiefs keep bringing him back. Sherman is now in his seventh season with the Chiefs because of his special-teams ability. He led the Chiefs in special-teams tackles with five heading into Monday night's game against the Chargers. -- <i>Adam Teicher</i></p>

      <p>On an offensive line with <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/13978/tyron-smith">Tyron Smith</a>, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/15793/travis-frederick">Travis Frederick</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/16709/zack-martin">Zack Martin</a>, it is easy to be overlooked, but Collins is having his best season. He came to the Cowboys as an undrafted free agent playing left guard and moved to right tackle in his third season. He has become comfortable in his techniques and has found the right blend between aggressiveness and patience, especially in pass protection. The only issue he has is a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee that he aggravated in Sunday's win at Detroit. If he can't play, then folks will see his value. -- <i>Todd Archer</i></p>

      <p>Yes, Hyde is averaging 76.9 yards per game, nearly double what he averaged last season, but he is sometimes overlooked because he plays on an offense highlighted by quarterback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson">Deshaun Watson</a> and wide receiver <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/15795/deandre-hopkins">DeAndre Hopkins</a>.

But the fourth-year pro, who entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent, often comes up with big-time plays. He has two interceptions, two forced fumbles and a team-best 82 tackles this season. Littleton, also a special-teams standout, is in the final season of his contract. -- <i>Lindsey Thiry</i></p>

      <p>Phillips is a known commodity among the Bills fan base, but the rest of the league likely will get to know him this coming offseason, as he has played himself into a sizable payday. Despite initially taking a backseat to 2019 first-round pick <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/4039303/ed-oliver">Ed Oliver</a>, the upcoming free agent trails only Aaron Donald in sacks among defensive tackles with seven and has been a much-needed presence in Buffalo's interior pass rush. -- <i>Marcel Louis-Jacques</i></p>

      <p>Pascal has been the Colts' best receiver not named <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14924/ty-hilton">T.Y. Hilton</a> this season. Pascal, who was claimed off waivers from Tennessee in 2018, leads the Colts in receiving yards (364) despite being fifth (23) in receptions and third in targets (40). He'll continue to be one of quarterback <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/2578570/jacoby-brissett">Jacoby Brissett</a>'s favorite targets at receiver until Hilton returns from his calf injury, which has cost Hilton four games this season. -- <i>Mike Wells</i></p>

      <p>He isn't the fastest or flashiest corner out there, but there's no denying the value Mills brings to the Eagles' secondary. The defense has looked much different since he returned to the lineup Week 7 following a lengthy absence due to a foot injury. Over the past three games, opposing quarterbacks have managed only two passing touchdowns while averaging 170 passing yards per game. That's quite a shift from earlier in the season, when the Eagles were among the most giving pass defenses in the NFL. Mills' swagger and steady, physical style have been a big part of the turnaround. -- <i>Tim McManus</i></p>

      <p>Sure, the rookie was a second-round draft pick, but many observers wondered if the Raiders were too high on him when they traded away a former first-rounder in <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051391/gareon-conley">Gareon Conley</a> midseason to elevate Mullen. Turns out, the Raiders' instincts have been on the mark.

According to NFL's Next Gen Stats, he has been targeted 13% of the time, and quarterbacks have completed 19 of 39 attempts for 259 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions when Nelson is the nearest defender. -- <i>Brooke Pryor</i></p>

      <p>Ryan draws a tough assignment every week as the primary slot corner, along with lining up on the outside. In addition to his coverage, Ryan is asked to be a key player in run support, as evidenced by his 74 tackles -- second most on the team. His versatility as a defensive back makes him an impactful pass-rusher from the nickel spot. No defensive back has more sacks than Ryan (7.5) dating back to 2018. Ryan's 3.5 sacks this season also are second most on the team. His three interceptions are tied with safety <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/2574056/kevin-byard">Kevin Byard</a> for the team lead.

      <p>It might sound weird that a known quantity would be underrated, but Jones has been a consistently strong presence since signing with Detroit in 2016. He is tied for the NFL lead in touchdowns with eight and has had four or more catches in eight games this season.

In the win over the Steelers on Thursday, Schobert had two picks, including one that set up the game-clinching TD. He leads the team with 67 tackles, more than double that of anybody else on the roster.

He leads the league in sacks yet again with 12.5, but Jones didn't make the NFL Network's Top 100 ranking. He is a game-changer every week who forces offensive lines to prepare accordingly for him, yet he is widely forgotten about outside the Cardinals locker room. -- <i>Josh Weinfuss</i></p>

Allen had one of the team's four interceptions in a win over Carolina after the Falcons had just four takeaways entering the game. "For me, I'm not a stat guy," Allen said.

He has two All-Pro nods, but it's just not enough. No other player has more solo tackles (689) or fumble recoveries (14) since 2012, and he is the only player aside from Brian Urlacher to record 800-plus tackles, 20-plus sacks and 10-plus interceptions through his first seven seasons.

But Simmons isn't as routinely mentioned as some of the game's better safeties. Simmons has taken well to coach Vic Fangio's scheme, as the Broncos have spent much of the season in the league's top 10 in total defense, scoring defense and pass defense (No. 4, No. 8 and No. 5, respectively, after 10 games). -- <i>Jeff Legwold</i></p>

He leads the team with four receiving touchdowns and is coming off his first 100-yard game, the first 100-yard game by a Jets tight end since Dustin Keller in 2011. The Jets have tweaked Griffin's role in recent weeks, moving him around the formation. He has earned the trust of QB <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912547/sam-darnold">Sam Darnold</a>.

He has 604 receiving yards and four touchdowns this season and is on pace for 966 yards, which would easily be a career high. With <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915399/preston-williams">Preston Williams</a> out for the season with a torn ACL, Parker has stepped up as the Dolphins' No. 1 receiver, and the offense has run through him.

And it's easy to get lost in the fact that the Redskins' pass defense stinks, especially on third down, where they rank 32nd. Dunbar only has five passes defended this season, which is a low number. But there's a reason: Most of the issues stem from teams attacking elsewhere. Despite fewer chances, Dunbar does have a team-high three picks.
