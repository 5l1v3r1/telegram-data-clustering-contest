      <p>The British actress is no stranger to playing royalty, having taken home the Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Queen Anne in “The Favourite”. She will now wear the crown in the Netflix series as she takes over the role originated by Claire Foy.</p>
      <p>As the series moves into the mid-1960s, Colman’s transformation into the monarch wowed her co-stars, including Helena Bonham Carter.</p>

      <p>“The first time I saw Olivia in her wig it was magical, it was like, ‘Oh my God, the Queen is in the room,'” the actress says. Carter is taking on the role of Princess Anne for the next season of the award-winning series.</p>
      <p>The new video shows a time-lapse of Colman undergoing the hair and makeup process for the part, for which she wears hand-created costumes.</p>
      <p>Colman and Bonham Carter are joined by new season-3 cast members, including “Outlander”‘s Tobias Menzies, Josh O’Connor, Erin Doherty, Jason Watkins, Marion Bailey, Emerald Fennell, and Ben Daniels. The cast will remain for season 4 and add Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher and Emma Corrin as Princess Diana as the story moves into the late 1970s.</p>
