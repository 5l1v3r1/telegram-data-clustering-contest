      <p>This pilot fish doesn’t have a traditional tech background. He was the photographer for his university department, and when the World Wide Web came along he volunteered to run the department’s in-house web server. A few years after that, they’re running Filemaker databases online, and there’s some glitch that causes Filemaker to freeze.</p>
      <p>Fish’s research leads him to think that a little knowledge of Unix would be helpful. So he heads to a discount bookstore, where he asks the guy behind the counter, “Do you have anything on Unix?” The clerk promptly replies, “I don’t think so, but try the social science section.”</p>
      <p>Fish starts off in the direction the finger is pointing, pondering why books on Unix books would be categorized as <i>social</i> science. And stops after just a few steps when it hits him: eunuchs, not Unix.</p>
