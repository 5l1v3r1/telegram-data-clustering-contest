      <h1>Lovering family feud as Airdrie hero Paul and Albion Rovers player son Lewis prepare for derby day</h1>
      <h2>The Diamonds will travel to Cliftonhill in the Scottish Cup this weekend to add a new chapter to the Monklands rivalry.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:33:46+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Pirie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-pirie/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/airdrie-hero-backs-old-hibs-16537507">Airdrie legend Paul Lovering</a> will be backing his beloved Diamonds on Monklands Derby day – but expect a family feud with son Lewis cheering on his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/albion-rovers-goal-hero-scores-20865830">Albion Rovers</a> teammates.</p>
      <p>The Lovering household will be a tense place this weekend ahead of the huge Scottish Cup clash at Cliftonhill.</p>
      <p>Ex-skipper Paul proudly wore the diamond during his near decade of service to the club.</p>
      <p>However, after penning a deal this summer Lewis is looking to make the breakthrough in ML5.</p>
      <p>Lewis said it was never “too big a thing” with former Airdrie assistant boss Paul as he signed for the League Two neighbours.</p>
      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/ex-rangers-goalkeeper-scott-gallacher-20865329">Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser</a> : “My dad just wants the best for me. He did have a couple of things to say, but really he was just buzzing for me to get the chance to play at that level.”</p>

      <p>Having watched Airdrie and Paul play against Rovers in Coatbridge Lewis says he has 100 per cent switched allegiances.</p>
      <p>“I’ve watched my dad in these derby games from the Airdrie side of things, but now I’d rather we win in the Scottish Cup rather than them,” the 19-year-old added.</p>
      <p>Paul joked: “I’m sure on the day it will be an interesting conversation!</p>
      <p>“It should be a great tie for both clubs. I know Kevin Harper and Ian Murray really well and I’m sure they will be desperate to get a result.”</p>
      <p>The proud dad admits he wants to see a win for Ian Murray’s men – but still hopes to see Lewis make his first-team debut soon for the local rivals.</p>
      <p>He went on: “It’s nice to see Lewis getting to that level.</p>

      <p>“For him to sign with Albion Rovers was great but Airdrie still holds a place in my football heart.”</p>
      <p>Lewis, who is currently on loan at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/caledonian-braves-assistant-boss-hunt-20866495">Caledonian Braves in the Lowland League</a> , says Rovers tag as underdogs will help them this weekend.</p>
      <p>He said: “Last season Kevin did an unbelievable job when everybody thought Albion Rovers would go down.</p>
      <p>“For a lot of this season we have been the underdogs again. We might not have done as well as we can do but I think we can really kick on.</p>
      <p>“The boys have the ability to play at a higher level.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big challenge to show we can compete with the big teams, but Kevin and Joe [McLaughlin] are absolutely brilliant and bring the best out of everybody.</p>
      <p>“They will have the experience of big games in the Scottish Cup.”</p>

      <p>Retired defender Paul says there is more pressure on the visitors, but reckons former Hibs teammate Murray will have the team well prepared: “Scottish Cup day was always massive for me as a player and for the supporters.</p>
      <p>“Knowing Ian he will have the guys up for it. You have to have the professionalism to not underestimate the players you’re playing against.</p>
      <p>“They always push everybody in training.”</p>

      <p>When pushed for a winner, the family feud rumbled on.</p>
      <p>Paul said: “ <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/ex-rangers-goalkeeper-scott-gallacher-20865329">Airdrie</a> of course.”</p>
      <p>Lewis responded: “Rovers – no surprises there!”</p>
