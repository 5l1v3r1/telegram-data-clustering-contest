      <h1>‘Market operator’ pushes Rangers player forward as he speaks of ‘affordable price’ transfers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:33:38+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Rangers doing well in the Europa League has brought further attention to the men playing for Steven Gerrard.</p>
      <p>Alfredo Morelos and Steven Davis were the goalscorers as Rangers beat Porto 2-0 earlier this month, and the Colombian has been receiving plenty of transfer attention.</p>
      <p>Morelos has been linked with moves to the Premier League, Serie A and La Liga, although Gerrard will do all he can to keep the forward beyond January, given the title battle Rangers are currently in.</p>
      <p>But it’s not only Morelos who has been catching the eye. Glen Kamara has been impressing for Finland, helping his country qualify for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>That’s seen his name edged forward to the market.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/altre-notizie/tmw-radio-bertuzzi-finlandia-atipica-in-scandinavia-tanti-talenti-1315998">TMW</a> have been speaking to Fabrizio Bertuzzi, who they describe as a ‘market operator and Scandinavian football expert’.</p>
      <p>He explained there’s players from Finland, Sweden and Norway available at an ‘affordable price’ and picked out Kamara as someone who is impressing: <i>“The 24 year old is playing incredible European qualifiers: he plays at Glasgow Rangers and is from the Arsenal school, a historic forge of midfielders. There are so many guys, even in Sweden and Norway, that can be bought at an affordable price: I hope they can have a great future.”</i></p>
      <p>There’s a reasonable chance that in his role as a ‘market operator’, Bertuzzi has been telling Italian clubs all about the Rangers player.</p>
