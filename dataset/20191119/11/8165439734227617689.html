      <h3>Schitt's Creek</h3>
      <p>The famously rich Rose family have known nothing but wealth their whole lives.</p>

      <p>Johnny and Moira move to the town and live in a small room at a motel with their spoiled children David and Alexis.</p>
      <p>We see their world flip upside down as they live without the luxuries from their previous life.</p>
