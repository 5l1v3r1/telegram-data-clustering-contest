      <p>Lars Bohinen played a key role in Nottingham Forest's rapid rise from Division One strugglers to Premier League contenders in the 90s and is now backing his son to do the same 25 years later.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian midfielder had a special relationship with the City Ground faithful and still looks back on his time playing for the Reds with great affection.</p>

      <p>Now managing Aelsund, Lars has guided his team to the top division where he will come up against his talented son, although Bohinen senior is hoping Emil can use his form as a stepping stone to English football.</p>
      <p>Emil currently has four goals and six assists in the Eliteserien and his dad feels he is well suited to the rigours of Championship football.</p>

      <p>“I was hoping to bring him to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> at some point actually, I think he can manage the standard (Championship). Like me, maybe the Premier League isn’t the first place to go but we will see," Lars told the <a href="https://www.chad.co.uk/sport/football/former-nottingham-forest-favourite-lars-bohinen-reflects-on-his-time-trentside-1-10110192">Mansfield and Ashfield Chad.</a></p>
      <p>The 20-year-old can play either central or right midfield and has represented Norway at U21 level and was selected for this summer European Championship in Italy.</p>
