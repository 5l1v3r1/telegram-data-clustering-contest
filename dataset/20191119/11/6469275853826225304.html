        <b>Preston pair Alan Browne and Sean Maguire have had to put their hopes of playing at Euro 2020 with the Republic of Ireland on hold until March.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Browne played the whole of the 1-1 draw with Denmark on Monday night, a result which prevented them qualifying automatically for next summer’s tournament.</p>
      <p>His North End team-mate Maguire was an 82nd-minute substitute in the clash at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin.</p>
      <p>On the night Browne was one of Ireland’s better performers in a game they had the better of.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old was a surprise starter on the right-hand side of a front three.</p>
      <p>He finished the game playing in defence once Shane Duffy was thrown up front to lend his height to the attack.</p>
      <p>Maguire came off the bench as the Emerald Isle chased the winning goal needed to send them through automatically.</p>
      <p>Browne said: “We were gutted not to win the game, we left everything out on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“We played some good football at times and it just wasn’t to be.</p>
      <p>“I think we played the better football, had the better chances but we weren’t quite clinical enough in the final third.</p>
      <p>“Their goal made us come out and go for it and them going up 1-0 up was too much for us to come back from.”</p>
      <p>Denmark took a 73rd-minute lead through former Middlesbrough striker Martin Braithwaite.</p>
      <p>Ireland equalised five minutes from time through Matt Doherty.</p>
      <p>The play-offs for Euro 2020 take place in the March international break.</p>
      <p>To get through, Ireland would have to win a one-legged semi-final and then a final. The draw for the play-offs take place on Friday.</p>
      <p>For Browne, the Denmark game was his ninth senior cap, with Maguire winning his eighth cap.</p>
      <p>Browne has really started to establish himself in the Irish squad over the last three international breaks.</p>
      <p>He had a stop-start time for his country due to injury but has featured in all six games the Republic have played in the 2019/20 season.</p>
      <p>Ireland manager Mick McCarthy is clearly a big fan of Browne’s.</p>
      <p>Interviewed before the Denmark game, McCarthy said Browne had impressed him in last Thursday’s 3-1 win over New Zealand in a friendly, earning him a starting berth on Monday night.</p>
