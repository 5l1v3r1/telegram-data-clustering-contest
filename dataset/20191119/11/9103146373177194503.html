      <p><u>HEALTH</u>  <u>EPIDEMIC</u>  <u>MEASLES</u><br/><br/><b>The death toll from a measles outbreak raging in the Pacific nation of Samoa has risen to 15, with most of the victims' young children, UNICEF said Tuesday.</b><br/><br/>The UN children's agency said that suspected measles cases had topped 1,000 in the island nation, which has declared a state of emergency and launched a compulsory vaccination programme.<br/><br/>"The epidemic has claimed the lives of 14 children under-five years old and one adult," it said in a statement.<br/><br/>UNICEF said it was in the process of delivering more than 110,000 doses of measles vaccine to Samoa's population of about 200,000.<br/><br/>With the virus sweeping through the South Pacific, the agency said it had also sent vaccines to Tonga and Fiji.<br/><br/>Officials were also helping with preparations for potential outbreaks in Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, the Cook Islands, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia.<br/><br/>It said Samoa, which is by far the worst affected, had low measles vaccination rates of 28-40 percent.<br/><br/>In Tonga and Fiji, which have vaccination rates of 99 percent and 81 percent respectively, the outbreak is more contained and there have been no fatalities.<br/><br/>Children are the most vulnerable to measles, which typically causes a rash and fever but can also lead to brain damage and death.<br/><br/>Samoa has closed all schools and kindergartens, as well as banning children from public gatherings, in a bid to halt the spread of the virus. <br/><br/>After initially facing criticism for its slow response, the government had opened a national emergency operations centre to roll out mass vaccinations.</p>
