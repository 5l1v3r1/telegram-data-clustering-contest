        <b>EastEnders cast and crew have been filming some high octane and violent scenes for the new year as Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) will finally discover the true identity of Leo King (Tom Wells), leading to a vicious assault at the grave of his paedophile father Tony.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tony groomed and abused Whitney as a teenager for years while he was with her mum Bianca (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/patsy-palmer/">Patsy Palmer</a>) and Whitney eventually spoke out about her ordeal, leading to Tony being jailed. He later died in prison but his son, Leo, is convinced that his dad was innocent and has targeted Whitney for revenge.</p>

      <p>After finding her via Bianca, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/31/who-is-leo-in-eastenders-and-what-does-he-want-with-whitney-11017680/">he has built a connection with Whitney, who thinks she is in a loving relationship with him</a> – but disaster is set to strike when he exposes the true nature of his motives and leaves her terrified for her life. But how far is he prepared to go and will Whitney manage to escape his clutches.</p>

      <p>In scenes filmed at a graveyard, Leo launches a fierce attack on a frightened Whitney, revealing who he is and blaming her for Tony’s death. He grabs herroughly by the hair and throws her to the ground before forcing her face into the mud of the grave.</p>

      <p>Leo is already sporting cuts and bruises, suggesting that he has already been beaten up – with sources suggesting to Metro.co.uk that Callum Highway (Tony Clay) may have been involved in a fight with him previously.</p>

      <p>But as Leo exacts his revenge, the scenes look brutal and intense and Whitney is traumatised as she realises she has been lured into a dangerous trap.</p>

      <p>We can’t reveal the outcome of the attack but it is just the next step in a very long running storyline arc for Whitney, who boss Jon Sen recently confirmed was being pushed to the centre of the show over the next two years.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/08/eastenders-bosses-reveals-huge-two-year-story-for-whitney-dean-10647932/">He said at the time:</a> ‘We talk often in the story office about Whitney and her troubled past, and her history with men, and her bad luck in relationships. Shona plays tragedy so well and Whitney is such a compelling character. She is a character you can give these really tough stories to, and she plays them with such beauty and conviction — and power. You err away from her being happy!</p>

      <p>‘When I joined, Kate and I had a conversation where we both said “We’re fascinated by Whitney. This enigma — this character with this past that we all know about — and the fact that she can never find happiness, and where do we go?” and we agreed that we wanted to push her to the front and centre of the show in terms of investing in that character.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘This story becomes a chapter in a much longer arc that we have planned going forward. Without saying too much, this is just one more chapter in her story, but overtime — over the next 18 months — she learns from everything that you’re going to see, and going on into Christmas, and the 35th next year.’</p>
