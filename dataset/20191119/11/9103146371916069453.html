      <p><u>ACCIDENT</u>  <u>MINING</u> </p>
      <p><b>A coal mine explosion killed 15 people in north China's Shanxi province, state media reported Tuesday.</b><br/><br/>Nine other people were injured by the gas explosion on Monday afternoon, which took place in a mine owned by Shanxi Pingyao Fengyan Coal &amp; Coke Group Co, according to official news agency Xinhua.<br/><br/>Xinhua reported that 35 miners were working underground when the blast happened, but 11 miners were able to escape.<br/><br/>The injured miners were in a stable condition, Xinhua said.<br/><br/>Shen Xuping, an official at the Shanxi Administration of Coal Mine Safety, said Tuesday that the accident revealed a "lack of awareness of the rule of law and chaotic management" by the company involved, local media reported.<br/><br/>Shen said the accident was caused by activity that "broke the law and regulations," although authorities are still investigating the exact cause.<br/><br/>Deadly mining accidents are common in China, where the industry has a poor safety record.<br/><br/>At a meeting last week, the State Council -- China's cabinet -- ordered a "special crackdown on production-related safety issues" to "further improve workplace safety", Xinhua reported.<br/><br/>In December 2018, seven miners were killed in southwestern Chongqing municipality after the connecting segment of a mining skip broke and fell down a mine shaft.<br/><br/>In October the same year, 21 miners died in eastern Shandong province after pressure inside a mine caused rocks to fracture and break, blocking the tunnel and trapping the workers. <br/><br/>Only one miner was rescued alive.<br/><br/>In December 2016, explosions in two separate coal mines in the Inner Mongolia region and in northeastern Heilongjiang province killed at least 59 people.</p>
