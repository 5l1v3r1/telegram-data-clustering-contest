      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/zoe-ball/">Zoe Ball</a> has split from her boyfriend Michael Reed after nearly two years together, according to reports.</p>
      <p>It marked the first public relationship the Radio 2 presenter had since the tragic suicide of her boyfriend Billy Yates in 2017.</p>
      <p>According to sources, Zoe called time on the romance with construction boss Michael amid claims she was ‘growing uncomfortable’ with claims he was using her fame for his own benefit.</p>
      <p>‘Zoe knew deep down the relationship wasn’t going anywhere,’ a friend<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10373369/zoe-ball-dumps-boyfriend-clingy/"> told The Sun.</a></p>
      <p>‘She enjoyed her time with Michael but came to the conclusion he wasn’t a keeper, despite him believing they were getting serious.</p>
      <p>‘There were certain things she grew uncomfortable with, such as him wanting to become a model and act. Her close circle feared he was using her to enhance his own career.’</p>

      <p>The relationship followed the tragic death of Zoe’s former partner Billy, who died by suicide two years ago following a long battle with depression. She had previously been married to Fatboy Slim Norman Cook, with whom she shares two children, Woody and Nelly.</p>

      <p>When it comes to her split with Michael however, according to a source close to the Strictly It Takes Two presenter, all was amicable – things just didn’t work out.</p>
      <p>‘They have split but it is very amicable,’ the insider told the publication.</p>
      <p>‘With all Zoe’s had going on with Billy, work and Norman she’s had so much to deal with and sadly a new relationship was too much. It wasn’t possible.</p>

      <p>‘They remain friends but she’s happily single and focusing on her kids and work.’</p>
      <p>In September Zoe paid tribute to Billy to mark his birthday.</p>
      <p>She posted a snap of Billy lighting a fire lantern to her Instagram page, admitting that his ‘star still shines the brightest up there’.</p>
      <p>‘Beautiful full moon for your birthday eve Billface. Your star still shines the brightest up there,’ she said. ‘Fly forever free. Always in this old ♥ of mine.’</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old had previously spoken about her grief during her radio show, while reaching out to listeners going through similar situations.</p>
      <p>‘So tomorrow it’s going to be two-years since our dear Billy Yates died,’ she said.</p>
      <p>‘Anyone who has lost someone dear to them, be it a friend or a family member, will know that these anniversaries have a tendency to make your knees wobble and your heart hurt.</p>

      <p>‘I just wanted to reach out with thoughts and an extra dollop of love to anyone going through anything at the moment, whether it be mental health problems, perhaps a loved one is poorly or maybe you’re just having a right old tricky time of it at the moment.’</p>
