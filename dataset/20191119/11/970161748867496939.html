      <p>Police are looking into allegations of racism after Wetherspoon’s staff served a black man a banana paid for by someone else.</p>
      <p>Mark D’arcy-Smith, 24, walked out of the Richmal Crompton in Bromley, Kent, saying staff did not take the incident seriously and he contacted police.</p>
      <p>Bananas can be ordered for 30p on the pub’s app that allows strangers to buy food and drinks to be sent to any table.</p>
      <p>He was at the pub with his friend at the end of the week on November 8 when the order arrived.</p>
      <p>Mark said: ‘We both looked at each other then looked at the banana. It clicked that it wasn’t ours. It was clearly sent by someone who was trying to be racist.</p>

      <p>‘My friend went to talk to a staff member but they didn’t see what the issue was. He said: “do you know what’s wrong here?”.</p>
      <p>‘They thought they had brought an incorrect order. We had to explain what was wrong with that.</p>

      <p>‘I was sat on my own at this point. I looked around to see if I could spot anyone. I got anxious. I think someone sent it because it was anonymous.</p>
      <p>‘Two girls came over and asked if I was okay, if I was going to stay.’</p>
      <p>Mark believes that he thinks a rise of racism in football is fuelling the behaviour of many people.</p>

      <p>He added: ‘It made me feel confused, angry, lost and lonely. It was really overwhelming. All these emotions came in a matter of seconds.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t feel like many people understand what it feels like to be racially abused. The staff didn’t take it seriously.’</p>
      <p>When he returned to the pub the next day to file a complaint he was told that staff could not see the issue so he contacted police.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I had hoped they [Wetherspoon] would take the situation seriously. They just treated it like other incidents – like a bar fight.’</p>
      <p>A Wetherspoon spokesman said: ‘We apologise to the customer and appreciate the distress caused. This is now a police matter.</p>
