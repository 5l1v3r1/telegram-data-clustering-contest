      <p>CHARLOTTE COUNTY, Fla. -- Authorities are asking residents to be on the lookout for suspicious activity in their neighborhoods as the holidays approach.</p>
      <p>According to the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office, thieves are often on the lookout for delivery packages on front porches.</p>
      <p>They recommend these helpful tips to stop these package poachers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lock boxes: You can build or purchase a rugged lock box for your porch. Bolt it down to a permanent surface, concrete or asphalt work well.</li>
        <li>Timely package collection: Pick up your package immediately after delivery, or have a neighbor collect it. UPS, USPS, and FedEx all have tracking services to get a better idea of when exactly your order will arrive.</li>
        <li>Have your package delivered to you at work, so you can accept it immediately.</li>
        <li>Require a signature on all deliveries and insure your packages when possible.</li>
        <li>Security cameras: Security cameras are a tried and true deterrent for all manner of criminal behavior. Thieves are very aware of cameras and often look for them before attempting theft.</li>
        <li>Security signs: Post sign in your yard informing the poacher that your home is under video surveillance or has security alarms.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Residents can report suspicious activity immediately to the Charlotte County Sheriffâ€™s Office at <b>941-639-0013</b>.</p>
