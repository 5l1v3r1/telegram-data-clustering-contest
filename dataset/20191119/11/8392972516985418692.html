      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> were left wondering whether the campmates had access to make-up after last night's show.</p>
      <p>On Monday night, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a> presenter Kate Garraway and Caitlyn Jenner took on their first Bushtucker trial, Bugged Out.</p>
      <p>However, fans of the show began asking whether the pair had make-up on leading to questions whether the campmates are glamming up behind the scenes.</p>

      <p>One person said on Twitter: "@imacelebrity why is @kategarraway allowed make up? Looks like she got a face full of make-up... or has she not taken her makeup off since day 1?"</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Are they allowing make up this year on #imacelebrity? Because Garraway and Jenner had plenty on in their trial last night?"</p>
      <p>A third tweeted: "So they are allowed make up in the jungle because Kate Garraway is well glammed up #ImACeleb."</p>

      <p>Ent Daily has contacted reps for I'm A Celebrity for comment.</p>
      <p>During last night's trial, Kate and Caitlyn were strapped down inside transparent boxes, which were then lifted in the air.</p>
      <aside>Are they allowing make-up this year on I'm A Celebrity?</aside>
      <p>They had to chuck a ball into a moving bucket below them and had 10 minutes to try and get as many as they could.</p>
      <p>The pair were joined by a number of critters in the box as well as rats.</p>
      <p>They managed to get two balls each into the buckets, meaning they had four meals in total.</p>

      <p>Hosts <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec Donnelly</a> then revealed the pair had to split, with one going to the more luxury camp Croc Creek while one had to return to Snake Rock.</p>
      <p>The campmates in Croc Creek had to decide who they wanted to join them and they chose Kate, meaning Caitlyn went back to the less-than-luxury camp.</p>
