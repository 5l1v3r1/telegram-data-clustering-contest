      <h1>The great Brexit gamble – Rabobank</h1>

      <p>An election will be held on December 12. Prime minister Johnson is looking for a five-year mandate and a parliamentary majority for his Brexit-deal. It is easier for Johnson to win a parliamentary majority in an election than to win a popular majority in a People’s Vote, writes Stefan Koopman – Senior Market Economist at Rabobank.</p>
      <h3>Key quotes:</h3>
      <p>“Assuming that clarity on <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/brexit">Brexit</a> is the only thing that is broadly desired, party allegiances could potentially break down. The election will be dominated by tactical voting.”<br/> <br/>“If Johnson’s bet pays off, the new parliament will be able to pass Johnson’s existing deal. “Brexit” will then move to the tricky negotiations regarding the future relationship.”<br/> <br/>“But if Johnson’s bet backfires, the plot will twist again. A minority government led by Labour could lead the UK to a second referendum, and potentially a Remain outcome.”<br/> <br/>“The first scenario appears more likely, but opens up the risk of a no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020. A Tory majority may therefore bring plenty of scope for <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd">sterling</a> <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/volatility">volatility</a> next year.”</p>
