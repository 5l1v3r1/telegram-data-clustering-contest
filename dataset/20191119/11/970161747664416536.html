        <b>It’s not everyday Kerry Katona gets to hang out with cinema royalty so when she found herself on a boat with the late Sir Roger Moore, she grabbed the opportunity to ask if she could become his next Bond girl.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Atomic Kitten singer has recalled the unlikely time she was on a work trip with Cliff Richard, Tim Rice and of course, Sir Roger, and honestly, it might be one of the greatest showbiz stories ever.</p>
      <p>Initially starting off as an anecdote about I’m A Celebrity star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ian-wright/">Ian Wright</a>, Kerry writes in her latest column for new! magazine: ‘I once went to Paris with Wrighty on a work trip, alongside three Sirs – Cliff Richard, Tim Rice and Roger Moore.</p>
      <p>‘There’s a pic out there of me sitting on Cliff’s knee while I’ve got him in a headlock, with my leg over Tim Rice’s head.’</p>

      <p>Sounds like an absolute riot but, incredibly, events got even more raucous.</p>
      <p>Kerry then revealed: ‘On the same trip, I went over to a tipsy Sir Roger and asked, “Can I be your next Bond girl?”</p>
      <p>‘He shrieked, “I’m going to be the next f***ing Bond girl, dahhhling!”’</p>

      <p>What a legend.</p>
      <p>The reality star recalled: ‘His wife had to send him to bed! We were pissing ourselves laughing – Bond just got sent to bed by his wife!’</p>
      <p>Last night’s episode of I’m A Celebrity saw the likes of Caitlyn Jenner, Roman Kemp and Kate Garraway sharing their showbiz stories of encounters with the rich and famous, but to be honest, Kerry might have topped them all.</p>
      <p>Oh and FYI, we’ve found no evidence of the headlock photo but here’s a more civilised one of Kerry and Cliff at Disneyland Paris on the trip…</p>

      <p>The 39-year-old, who won I’m A Celebrity in 2004 went on to praise her pal Wrighty who’s competing this year and said: ‘Ian was lovely, and a real gentleman. I hope he’s a hit in the jungle.’</p>
      <p>Perhaps Kerry meeting Sir Roger before his death in 2017 inspired her passion for acting.</p>

      <p>The TV star made her small screen debut last year in a gritty drama, Still Here, which saw her play a mum who turned to drink while struggling to come to terms with her son’s death.</p>
      <p>So playing a Bond girl may not be too far off in the future…</p>
