      <p>SYDNEY, Nov 19 — Qantas has asked Airbus and Boeing for a better deal on planes capable of non-stop Sydney-London flights before deciding whether to place an order.</p>
      <p>“We asked them to go back and re-look at that to sharpen their pencils because there still was a gap there,” Qantas International Chief Executive Tino La Spina told an investor briefing today after Qantas outlined plans for capital spending to average A$2 billion (RM5.7 billion) a year.</p>
      <p>The Australian airline is considering launching the world’s longest non-stop flights because it sees demand for time-poor travellers willing to pay a premium to cut out stop-overs.</p>
      <p>Qantas is looking to replace its ageing fleet over the medium term and said it expected capacity growth in the domestic market to be near-flat in the current half.</p>
      <p>On its non-stop Perth-London route, it is achieving a 30 per cent fare premium in business and premium economy over one-stop flights from rivals, La Spina said.</p>
      <p>“That surprised us, just how much people valued direct flying,” he said.</p>
      <p>In addition to Sydney-London flights, the fleet of Airbus A350-1000 or Boeing 777-8 jets under consideration could also fly Melbourne-London and from Sydney and Melbourne to New York and Chicago, La Spina said.</p>
      <p>Qantas is examining an initial order for 12 planes, a source familiar with the matter, who was not authorised to speak with media, told Reuters.</p>
      <p>La Spina and Chief Executive Alan Joyce declined to be drawn on exact numbers during the briefing.</p>
      <p>“You have to have a big enough sized fleet to make the economics work,” Joyce said.</p>
      <p>Last week, following a London-Sydney test flight, he said Qantas would decide by the end of the year whether to proceed with plans for ultra-long haul flights and could place an order for planes early next year.</p>
      <p>Citi analysts in July forecast non-stop flights from Sydney to London and New York could add A$180 million annually to the carrier’s profit before tax, which was A$1.3 billion in the financial year ended June 30. — Reuters</p>
