      <p>Former White House special envoy Jason Greenblatt met with a Saudi blogger Tuesday morning on a train ride in Riyadh.</p>
      <p>Greenblatt, one of the architects of the Trump administration’s yet-to-be-unveiled Middle East peace plan, met with Mohammed Saud, a prominent Saudi blogger who made news earlier this year with <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/24219">his visit to Israel</a>, and <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/269039">his endorsement</a> of right-wing and religious parties in Israel’s Knesset election.</p>
      <p>“It’s great to meet you in person finally. I know we’ve been Twitter friends for a while, but I’m so glad to meet you. Continue your terrific work towards peace,” Greenblatt said in a brief video statement released by Saud via Twitter.</p>
      <p>In a Hebrew tweet, Saud lauded Greenblatt, calling him an “amazing person who wants and is trying to bring peace” to the Middle East.</p>
      <p>“I hope for peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia, that Saudis will visit Israel, and Israelis will visit Saudi Arabia,” continued Saud. “God bless Israel and the US and Saudi Arabia.”</p>
