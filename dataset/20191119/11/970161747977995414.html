      <p>The I’m A Celebrity star recently opened up about looking for love, explaining that she was chatting to a string of guys in a bid to find the one.</p>
      <p>And the 29-year-old – who shares daughter Sunday with ex Arthur Collins – has managed to narrow her search down from five men to one.</p>
      <p>‘I’m dating someone new and he’s really cool. It’s really looking promising,’ she revealed.</p>
      <p>‘I was talking to five different guys and now I’ve met someone who I think is very special. I’ve actually known him for a very long time.’</p>
      <p>However, before you start trying to figure out who her mystery man is, she admitted she won’t be unveiling him anytime soon – as she doesn’t want to pile the pressure on.</p>

      <p>‘I’m not going to say too much at this stage, because I want to give this new romance a chance. The minute I say who it is, it turns into a big deal and puts way too much pressure on things,’ she continued.</p>

      <p>‘It’s nice to enjoy the early days of a relationship and see how things go.’</p>
      <p>Despite not wanting force things with her new beau, Ferne already has her eye on their future together – and wants things to get serious soon.</p>
      <p>‘I’m proud to be a single parent, because it’s not an easy gig, but I hope this relationship goes somewhere – I’m fed up of doing it on my own,’ <a href="https://closeronline.co.uk/">she added to Closer magazine</a>.</p>
      <p>‘I’m all or nothing and I’m ready to get married.’</p>

      <p>‘He is not going to be my husband, definitely not going to be my boyfriend, we’re not going on a date. It was just a nice drunken smooch.</p>
      <p>‘I am not here to have a fling or to be mucking around. I am looking for a partner!’</p>
      <p>Well, it looks like her search is over…</p>
