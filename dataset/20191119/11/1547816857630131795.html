      <p>Daisy Shah is the Fashion Culprit Of The Day. The actress attended the party hosted by Salman Khan’s sister, Arpita Khan Sharma and her hubby, Aayush Sharma on the occasion of their 5th wedding anniversary. The fashion fever here was on an all-time low but Daisy Shah turned out to be the most disappointing one.</p>
      <p>Daisy wore a shiny metallic silver bodycon dress. She styled her hair in loose waves and completed the look with black studded pumps. Check her out below:</p>

      <p><b>FLAWS</b>: Daisy is giving us a feel that we are back to the 90s when fashion was all about such blingy clothes, screaming for attention. The dress is way too disastrous and Daisy’s look simply falls flat because of it. The studded pumps don’t save the day for the actress either.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- viral bhayani</i></p>
