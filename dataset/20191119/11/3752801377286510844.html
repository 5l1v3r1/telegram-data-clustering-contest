      <h1>PICS | Screaming taxi passengers alert Joburg metro cops to their drunk driver</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:24:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:24</time> by <a rel="author">Sesona Ngqakamba</a></address>
      <p>Taxi passengers were forced to take matters into their own hands on Monday, after realising their driver was under the influence of alcohol. </p>
      <p>The passengers on board the 15-seater taxi managed to alert a passing metro police vehicle to assist them.</p>
      <p>"The passengers screamed at officers who were passing, cautioning that the taxi driver was highly intoxicated and couldn't even drive straight. The vehicle was swerving," JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said. </p>
      <p>The incident happened on the M1 north freeway, near 11th Avenue. Minnaar said the driver had recorded a DUI reading of 1.74mg/l which is way above the legal limit for professional drivers.   </p>
      <p>He said, after the man was tested, he was immediately arrested and faces a drunk driving charge. He is expected to appear in court later this week. </p>
      <p>Minnaar added that the arrest was a warning to motorists that no drunk driving would be tolerated during festive season and that all perpetrators would be arrested and detained. </p>
      <p>JMPD chief David Tembe shared the incident to his Twitter page, eliciting a positive reaction from users who lauded the passengers for their bravery and good deed. </p>
      <p>"It's about time passengers alert officers of these taxi drivers that put their lives in danger. I always wonder, why are passengers allowing taxi drivers to skip red robots...drive recklessly nje. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VivaPassengers?src=hashtag_click">#VivaPassengers</a>," one user replied. </p>
