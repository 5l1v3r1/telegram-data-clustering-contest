      <h1>Amazon is offering some of its best devices at seriously low prices</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:32:59+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/joseph-green/" target="_blank">Joseph Green</a></address>
      <p><b>TL;DR:</b> The <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdwp">Echo Plus</a> is on sale for £44.99 on Amazon, saving you 68% on list price.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Amazon's "Countdown to Black Friday Sale" has been pretty decent so far, without really impressing. We suppose this is to be expected, as you wouldn't want all the best deals to drop before Black Friday officially starts. Where is the fun in that?</p>
      <p>Something we all expect to see fall in price is Amazon's own range of devices. These always seem to go on sale during the biggest shopping events of the year, including Prime Day and Black Friday. There haven't been loads of deals just yet, and most of the opportunities have come in the form of bundles.</p>
      <p>That has all changed though, with the <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdwp">Echo Plus</a> dropping in price by a massive 68%. This device is now available for just <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdwp">£44.99 on Amazon</a>, saving you £95 on list price. That is a huge discount, and really does start the countdown to Black Friday.</p>
      <p>There are likely to be plenty more deals on Amazon devices in the coming weeks, but this will be difficult to top. Why wait for Black Friday when this deal is ready for the plucking?</p>
      <p>Start the final countdown with a massive saving on the Echo Plus.</p>
