      <p>Kelly Macdonald will star in the next series of Line Of Duty as the “most enigmatic adversary AC-12 have ever faced”.</p>

      <p>The Scottish screen star, 43, is best known for roles in the Trainspotting films, lavish TV drama Boardwalk Empire and films Gosford Park, No Country For Old Men and Intermission.</p>

      <p>Line Of Duty writer and showrunner Jed Mercurio said: “We’re honoured that Kelly Macdonald will join Martin, Vicky and Adrian in series six of Line Of Duty.</p>
      <p>“DCI Joanne Davidson will prove the most enigmatic adversary AC-12 have ever faced.”</p>
      <p>Simon Heath, chief executive and creative director of Line Of Duty’s production company World Productions, said: “The Line Of Duty team have always been huge fans of her work, so we’re thrilled Kelly has agreed to join us this series to pit her wits against AC-12.”</p>
      <p>Macdonald was described as “one of the UK’s most versatile actors” by controller of BBC drama Piers Wenger.</p>
      <p>The fifth series of the popular police procedural aired earlier this year, with Stephen Graham in the guest lead as Detective Sergeant John Corbett.</p>
      <p>Its final episode drew more than nine million viewers when it aired in May, making it the most-watched drama since Mercurio’s Bodyguard, which aired in 2018.</p>
