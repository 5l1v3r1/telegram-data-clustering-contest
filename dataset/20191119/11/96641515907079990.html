      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:33:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/christine-fisher" target="_blank">Christine Fisher</a></address>
      <p>The Panasonic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/08/panasonics-g9-mirrorless-camera/">Lumix G9 4K</a> digital camera body is on sale for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0774KTV1X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkId=cd2eb2b61dcff4a387df077e337027b6&amp;language=en_US">$998</a> on Amazon today. This is the first time we've seen the price drop below $1,000. Considering that the G9's recommended retail price is $1,500, that's a significant discount on an all-around great camera.</p>
      <p>You might remember that Panasonic introduced the Lumix G9 as a photo-centric flagship. It's very similar to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/04/panasonic-gh5-6k-widescreen-intraframe/">10-bit, 4K GH5</a> video powerhouse that Panasonic is so well known for, but its body is better suited to still than video. It has a slimmed-down, dust-proof and splash-proof magnesium alloy exterior. Like the GH5, it's capable of 4K at 60 fps, but it also has an 80-megapixel photo mode that takes up to eight separate images.</p>
      <p>To make the camera even more appealing, recent updates have unlocked support for a lot of the video modes that the G9 was missing. You can get 10-bit 4K video at up to 30 fps internally, and 60-fps 10-bit 4K externally. That makes the G9 nearly as good as the GH5 for video, even better for still photography and less expensive.</p>
