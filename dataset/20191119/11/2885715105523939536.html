      <h1>Delhi University to offer BSc (Hons) Environmental Science from 2021</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:03:40+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/shyna-kalra/" target="_blank">Shyna Kalra</a></address>
      <p>The University of Delhi (DU) will launch the Bachelor in Science (B.Sc) Honours in Environmental Studies from the next academic year, 2021 onwards. Professor Radhey Shyam Sharma from the Department of Environment Science, DU informed <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a> that six colleges under the varsity have given the nod to implement the course while many others have shown interest.</p>
      <p>Each college is expected to offer at least 24 to a maximum of 32 seats for the course, which means that at least 144 new undergraduate seats will be created from the next admission cycle. The department currently offers masters and PhD level programmes only. The course was given a nod by the University Grants Commission (UGC) earlier and is expected to be implemented next year following interest from colleges.</p>
      <p>The selection process of the EVS is yet to be finalised. Admission to most undergraduate courses at DU is based on a cut-off where marks of ‘best of four’ class 12 subjects are considered. In the admission process for honours courses, one of the best four subjects includes a major. This might not be possible in case of BSc (Hons) Environmental Studies since most schools do not offer the same programme at class 12 level.</p>
      <p>Schools under the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) do not have Environmental Studies (EVS) even as an elective in their class 12 exams. Most applications in the DU admissions every year come from the CBSE stream. In DU admissions 2019 as well, a total of 2.70 lakh students applied for admissions at undergraduate courses in DU, of which 2 lakh were from CBSE-affiliated schools.</p>
      <p>The three-year course will have 140 credits spread over 26 papers. Students will have to pass eight electives and four ability-enhancement courses. Of the latter, two will be skill enhancement papers in the entire six-semester duration, as per UGC guidelines.</p>
