      <p>England coach Eddie Jones says there is a concern the Saracens players in his squad may put club before country after their Premiership survival was threatened by a 35-points deduction for breaching salary cap regulations.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: England coach Eddie Jones says there is a concern the Saracens players in his squad may put club before country after their Premiership survival was threatened by a 35-points deduction for breaching salary cap regulations.</p>
      <p>English and European champions Saracens, who were also fined 5.36 million pounds (US$6.94 million), said on Monday they would not appeal the punishment.</p>

      <p>Jones had nine Saracens players in his squad for the recent Rugby World Cup in Japan, including captain Owen Farrell, second row Maro Itoje, hooker Jamie George, full-back Elliot Daly, prop Mako Vunipola and his brother Billy, who plays at number eight.</p>
      <p>"Obviously there may be some dislocation between Saracens players and the rest of the clubs," Jones told the BBC. "That's a reality.</p>
      <p>"We may have to work to mend those relationships a bit harder and there might be some Saracens players who feel like they've got to play for their club instead of their country, to make sure they don't go down.</p>
      <p>"It could have a significant impact. It's something we need to weigh up and look at very carefully."</p>
      <p>As a result of the sanction, Saracens' current points tally will be adjusted to -22, leaving them 26 points adrift of 11th-placed Leicester Tigers.</p>
      <p>England, who finished runners-up to South Africa at the World Cup, begin their Six Nations campaign against France on Feb. 2.</p>
