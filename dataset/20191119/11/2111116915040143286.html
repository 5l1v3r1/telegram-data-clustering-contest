      <h3>Sony's bizarre new speaker straps a home cinema system around your neck</h3>
      <p>Okay Sony</p>
      <p>(Image credit: Sony)</p>
      <p>If you've ever looked at your <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/home-cinema-audio/tr-top-10-best-soundbars-1288008">soundbar</a> and thought "I wish I could wrap that thing around my neck", the good news is that Sony will now let you do that – sort of.</p>
      <p>Sony's 'wearable speaker' combines the convenient form factor of headphones with the immersive sound of a home cinema system, allowing you to hear your films and TV shows late at night without disturbing your neighbors by blasting your soundbar.</p>

      <p>First launched in Japan in 2017, the Sony Immersive Wearable Speaker is finally available to buy in the US, with a fairly hefty $300 price tag – although if you preorder by December 1 you can get it for an introductory price of $250. </p>
      <p>Sony hasn't revealed when or if the wearable speaker will come to other regions, but that US price works out at about £230 / AU$440 based on current conversion rates.</p>

      <h4>A soundbar alternative</h4>
      <p>With no Bluetooth compatibility, the headphone/speaker hybrid relies on you manually plugging a 3.5mm jack or optical cables into its wireless receiver. You can also connect it to your <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-phone/2">smartphone</a> using a USB-C cable, although that's not quite as convenient as using a pair of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/portable-audio/best-wireless-headphones-1280344">wireless headphones</a>.</p>
      <p>According to Engadget, the Immersive Wearable Speaker offers around three hours of battery life, so if you want to watch a long film you may find yourself running out of juice towards the end.</p>
      <p>While it may look like a one-off novelty device, it's not the first time we've seen such a gadget – the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/jbl-soundgear">JBL Soundgear</a> neck speaker and the Bose Soundwear both utilize a similar design to provide an alternative to your soundbar. </p>
      <p>The neckband speaker design could be great if you tend to watch TV alone – but a family of four wanting to enjoy an immersive cinematic experience would need to spend $1,200 (around £930 / AU$1,750) on a Sony Immersive Wearable Speaker for everyone.</p>
      <p>For that money, you could buy a truly fantastic soundbar – and just turn it down a little for your late-night <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/television/best-netflix-series-25-great-netflix-tv-shows-1288230">Netflix</a> binges.</p>
