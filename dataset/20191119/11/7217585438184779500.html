      <h1>An MP4 video could let hackers access your WhatsApp data</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:38:39+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:38</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Walker</a></address>
      <p>A new WhatsApp security vulnerability <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11931">has been detailed</a> that allows attackers to gain access to personal messages and files using a malicious video file.</p>
      <p>According to the report, the “specially crafted MP4” video file triggers a buffer overflow, a vulnerability that was exploited via a voice call on the service <a href="http://memeburn.com/2019/05/whatsapp-spyware-exploit-unusual-but-method-more-than-30-years-old/">earlier this year</a>.</p>
      <p>Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2019-11931">detailed the vulnerability</a> in an advisory, explaining that metadata present in the MP4 could allow an attacker to execute remote code on the victim’s device.</p>
      <p>This could effectively allow an attacker to gain access to personal messages or files on the victim’s device.</p>
      <p>According to a response from WhatsApp to The Next Web, the messaging service <a href="https://thenextweb.com/security/2019/11/18/whatsapp-fixes-bug-that-would-have-let-hackers-exploit-devices-using-mp4-files/">does not believe</a> users were impacted. However, it’s important that you ensure your WhatsApp version is up to date.</p>
      <p>Facebook noted that the <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11931">affected versions</a> of WhatsApp are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Android versions prior to 2.19.274;</li>
        <li>iOS versions prior to 2.19.100;</li>
        <li>Enterprise Client versions prior to 2.25.3;</li>
        <li>Business for Android versions prior to 2.19.104;</li>
        <li>Business for iOS versions prior to 2.19.100.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>WhatsApp has patched newer versions of its apps.</p>
