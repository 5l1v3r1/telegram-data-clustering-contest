      <p>Lyca Radio, one of London’s largest Asian radio stations and part of Lyca Media, the entertainment arm of Lyca Group, has announced the signing of media personality, Salil Acharya. He will host the ‘Drive Time’ show Monday to Friday from 16:00 – 19:00 which started on 11th November.</p>
      <p>Over the past 10 years, Acharya has built an excellent reputation as an actor, VJ, radio jockey and television host. He made his Bollywood debut in Mohit Suri’s 2007 film, ‘Awarapan’.
