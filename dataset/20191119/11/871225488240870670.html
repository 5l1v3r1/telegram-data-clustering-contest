      <p>After his solo presentation at the <a href="https://performancein.live/influencer-marketing-show/">Influencer Marketing Show,</a> Anthony Richardson, managing director of Q-83, chatted about why he thinks content creators are in fact social publishers, how to get your hands on transparent data, and how we can all help professionalise the industry. </p>
      <p>Richardson founded Q-83 just over a year ago as he saw a gap in the market for transparent, accurate data that can be easily shared between influencers, brands, and agencies. </p>
