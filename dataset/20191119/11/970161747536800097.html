      <p>Warwick Davis has revealed some of his favourite memories from working on several films in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> franchise, including the times the late Carrie Fisher looked after him on set.</p>
      <p>The actor and presenter, 49, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/03/18/warwick-davis-reveals-he-was-in-star-wars-the-last-jedi-and-how-fans-can-see-the-scene-7396663/">first starred in Return of the Jedi when he was just 11 years old,</a> after his grandmother heard a radio advert calling for people who were less than four feet tall to be in the movie.</p>
      <p>He revealed how special it was to work alongside the greats like Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher as a big fan of Star Wars.</p>
      <p>Warwick told Metro.co.uk: ‘I first met them when I was 11. Carrie, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford were my heroes at that age.</p>
      <p>‘I had trouble differentiating between them as the actors and their characters, so Harrison Ford was always Han Solo and Carrie was always Princess Leia, and I couldn’t see them any other way.’</p>

      <p>Warwick, who had teamed up with Argos to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-interview-our-project-has-always-been-single-player-focused-11068395/">celebrate the launch of the new video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a>, also shared a touching story of how Carrie would look out for him on set.</p>
      <p>He explained: ‘<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/12/28/warwick-davis-shares-throwback-photos-of-carrie-fisher-at-star-wars-wrap-party-and-pays-touching-tv-tribute-to-her-6347304/">She was such a lovely lady, it’s so sad she’s no longer with us.</a> I enjoyed working with her and she was so lovely to me when I was in my Ewok costume.</p>

      <p>‘She was very worried about me getting too hot. And every time I took the character’s head off, so I could get some air, she would be there with some chocolate milk and a cookie to kind of revive me.</p>
      <p>‘Not that I needed reviving, but I certainly enjoyed the chocolate milk and the cookie!’</p>
      <p>Warwick also explained the magical moment when he looked out onto the set from his costume and couldn’t believe he was standing on the set of Star Wars.</p>
      <p>He explained: ‘I remember a moment on Force Awakens when I was in my character head so I couldn’t see very much through all of the animatronics and stuff.</p>

      <p>‘I had a tiny little hole to look through in the creature mask and I remember seeing the clapperboard come in at the start of the shot.</p>
      <p>‘They said “roll cameras” and the clapperboard came in and I managed to catch through this tiny hole, the word Star Wars on the clapperboard.</p>

      <p>‘And I was like wow, you know, thinking in my head it’s really happening again, we’re embarking on the trilogy of Star Wars here with the Force Awakens.</p>
      <p>‘It was kind of kicking it all off again and it was certainly a moment that I remember making a particular impact on me, just seeing that Star Wars clapperboard once again.’</p>
      <p>Warwick had teamed up with Argos for the launch of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which is available to buy now from <a href="http://argos.co.uk/">argos.co.uk</a> and all stores.</p>
