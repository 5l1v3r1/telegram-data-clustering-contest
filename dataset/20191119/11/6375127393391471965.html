      <h3>THE two Manila policemen who did a follow-up operation and successfully arrested the driver who nearly killed a traffic enforcer over the weekend were rewarded by Mayor Isko Moreno, along with the said enforcer whom he ordered promoted to a permanent position.</h3>
      <p>The two policemen, identified as Cpl. Rhannie Nicdao and Pat. Glen Cawaling, were also lauded by Moreno for the swift action that resulted in the immediate arrest of the suspect identified as Orlando Ricardo Dizon Jr., 54, of No. 47 Gonzales Drive, Dona Pilar Compound, Batasan Hills, Quezon City.</p>
      <p>The said cops were accompanied to the mayor by Manila Traffic and Parking Bureau (MTPB) chief Dennis Viaje and the victim,  MTPB enforcer Mc Adrian Lim, 21, who was commended by Moreno for his dedication to his work, to the point of risking his life for it. Lim is assigned under Sector 3 commander Modesto Caguiaoa.                                                                                 </p>
      <p>In that meeting, Moreno directed Viaje to find a regular item for Lim who, it was learned, is a job order (JO) personnel earning only P6,000 a month being a non-regular employee. It was learned from Viaje that Lim is among the newly-employed personnel who were hired after Moreno assumed office.             </p>
      <p>The mayor then gave the two policemen an undisclosed amount of cash reward and told them to give their families a treat and to keep up the good work.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Viaje said that Lim is back to his old post after getting treatment for the wounds he sustained during the incident.</p>
      <p>Viaje said that while being issued a ticket for a traffic violation, Dizon sped off and on instinct, Lim held on to the car door. Dizon then tried to get him off by accelerating speed and zigzagging his vehicle, even hitting another car in the process.                                                                                                                      </p>
      <p>When Lim was able to let go safely, the suspect continued speeding off and got arrested near the corner of Oroquieta  and Tayuman Streets in Sta. Cruz.  Lim sustained wounds as a result of the incident.</p>
      <p>Moreno said the suspect showed no remorse for what happened and had been charged accordingly.</p>
      <p>He expressed disgust that while the suspect could afford to buy a car, he chose to nearly kill a traffic enforcer just to avoid paying a fine of only P500.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mayor Isko Moreno yesterday lauded the students of Araullo High School for having taken the cudgels for the city government against vandals.</p>
      <p>The said students themselves painted over the graffitis on the wall of their own school.</p>
      <p>Spray-painted on the wall were the words, ‘Makatwitran ang maghimagsik’  which earned the ire of passersby and the students themselves.</p>
      <p>Araullo High School is located on Taft Avenue, a few meters away from the Manila Police District (MPD) Headquarters.</p>
