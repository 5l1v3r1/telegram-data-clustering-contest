      <p>A couple who've been trying to use a 'broken' plug socket for two years finally found out why they couldn't use it.</p>
      <p>Darren Steels and his partner were bewildered by the double plug socket in the kitchen of their home in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.</p>
      <p>They had tried a variety of electrical goods in the sockets since they moved into the property in 2017, saying it was in the perfect location to vacuum under the stairs, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/homeowner-who-been-baffled-broken-3549295">Nottinghamshire Live reports.</a></p>
      <p>Darren said: "It's perfectly placed for vacuuming the stairs, instead of having the cord running across the kitchen floor."</p>
      <p>The socket didn’t feel loose or anything, and when the couple had decorators in to redo the kitchen soon after they moved in, nothing was flagged up.</p>
      <p>The 45-year-old added: "People have just painted around it."</p>
      <p>Darren said: "I was just fed up with it. We had an electrician come round to do some other bits and bobs and I asked him to have a look at it."</p>
      <p>The electrician confirmed there was no current to the socket, before trying to tackle the problem in a different way.</p>
      <p>Darren, a restaurant manager, said: "He prised it open, and it came away from the wall."</p>
      <p>And what was revealed was - a secret safe.</p>

      <p>Sadly, though, it wasn’t filled with cash or valuables: "There was just dust, fluff and a dead spider in it."</p>
      <p>He posted a video of it online on Sunday, November 17 - and people have been loving it, with more than 60,000 views so far. </p>
      <p>The safe should have a key which slots into one of the the holes for the plug pins, but it was unlocked - and Darren said he didn't have the key for it.</p>
      <p>However, he said he would be keeping the safe as it was, for "posterity".</p>
