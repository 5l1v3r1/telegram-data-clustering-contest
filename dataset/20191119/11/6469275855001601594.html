        <b>Chorley boss Jamie Vermiglio believes the victory over Chesterfield on Saturday could be a turning point in their season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Magpies earned their second win of the season – their first away from home – with a 3-2 victory at the Proact Stadium.</p>
      <p>Two goals from loan striker Charlie Vernam and one from skipper Courtney Meppen-Walter saw Vermiglio’s men move to five points from safety.</p>
      <p>Although they still sit bottom, the boss believes the win at a place like Chesterfield – arguably the biggest club in non-league football – will provide a massive confidence boost.</p>
      <p>“It’s that confidence we will get from showing that we can play football and match one of the better sides in the league,” he said.</p>
      <p>“They have fantatsic resources. You only need to look around their ground once to see what they have got behind the scenes.</p>
      <p>“They have got a lot of support, a lot of backing but we were able to come here and play better than them and show that we are good enough.</p>
      <p>“We need to do that again next week, the week and the week after that.</p>
      <p>“I am going to enjoy this win but not get carried away.</p>
      <p>“We need to kick on now and show some consistency.”</p>
      <p>This weekend, Chorley host Torquay United – another former Football League club – at Victory Park.</p>
      <p>Gary Johnson’s Gulls are currently going well at the moment in sixth spot in the table, three points off leaders Barrow.</p>
      <p>Vermiglio is hopeful club captain Andrew Teague and fellow defender Scott Leather maybe available.</p>
