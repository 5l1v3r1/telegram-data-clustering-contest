      <p>If you’ve not played Dragon Quest Builders 2 you can see what Miguel thought:</p>
      <blockquote>It was hard for me to imagine a way to expand on a game that was already so good but Dragon Quest Builders 2 has managed to do just that. A bigger story, new things to build, multiplayer and more make this an absolutely jam-packed experience. Building game enthusiasts will love the blend of crafting and survival management, while Dragon Quest fans are sure to love the unique spin on the long-running JRPG franchise, and if you’re a fan of both? Well, Dragon Quest Builders 2 is the must have game of 2019.</blockquote>
