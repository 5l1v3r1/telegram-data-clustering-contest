      <h1>Nottingham Forest welcome back key player from injury for Championship clash against Bristol City</h1>
      <h2>Veteran centre-back Michael Dawson has been out since September</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:34:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:34</time> by <a rel="author">Max Baker</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest defender Michael Dawson is set to return from an injury lay off in time to face Bristol City this weekend.</p>
      <p>Former Spurs centre-back Dawson hasn't featured for Forest since picking up a calf injury in his side's win over Stoke on September 27, but could now feature as the Robins host the team positioned one place above them in the Championship, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/fits-like-dream-praise-nottingham-3551874">reports Nottinghamshire Live</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> host Forest this Saturday at Ashton Gate and will look to continue their four-game unbeaten run, but it could be tough for the Robins with Dawson back in the side.</p>
      <p>Dawson, who played four times for England, had played every minute of the Championship campaign until picking up the injury and excels in the air, as well as averaging almost five clearances per game.</p>
      <p>Forest have the second best defensive record in the league, conceding just 13 times, behind only Leeds United, and Dawson will add further experience to one of the league's best backlines.</p>
      <p>It could be difficult for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/lee-johnsons-tinkering-works-bristol-3548591">City to break Forest down</a>, but the Robins also have positive news heading into the game.</p>
      <p>Famara Diedhiou is back from suspension for the Forest game, after he netted a hat trick on international duty with Senegal against Eswatini on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Adam Nagy could start again after his return from injury against Cardiff City and Korey Smith featured again for the U23s on Monday in a 2-1 over Crystal Palace U23s, signalling his imminent return.</p>

      <h3>Other Forest injury news</h3>
      <p>Midfielders Alfa Semedo and Samba Sow are both expected to train with the squad ahead of the match, but are unlikely to start.</p>
      <p>Semedo suffered a back injury in September and Sow injured his hamstring in the win over Brentford in October.</p>
      <p>Defender Carl Jenkinson will still be out for a few weeks after suffering an ankle injury against Preston North End in August.</p>
      <p>Former Leicester defender Yohan Benalouane has returned to training after not featuring for Forest since April, but Lamouchi hasn't confirmed whether he will be back for the City game following his hip injury.</p>
      <p>Tendayi Darikwa won't be back until 2020 after rupturing his ACL before the start of the season. The right back played his last game in June and Forest boss Sabri Lamouchi has said he'll be out for at least six months.</p>
