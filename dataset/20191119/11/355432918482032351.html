      <p>Four current and former Trump administration officials will kick off the second week of public impeachment hearings today before the House Intelligence Committee as Democrats look to boost their case in the ongoing inquiry into <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a></b>’s dealings with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Today’s testimony features four key witnesses before the panel: National Security Council (NSC) Director for European Affairs Lt. Col.<b> <a href="https://thehill.com/people/alexander-vindman">Alexander Vindman</a>; Jennifer Williams</b>, a career foreign service officer and adviser to <b>Vice President Pence; <a href="https://thehill.com/people/kurt-volker">Kurt Volker</a>, </b>the former special envoy to Ukraine; and <b>Tim Morrison</b>, an outgoing member of the NSC. </p>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/471001-public-impeachment-hearings-enter-second-week">As Olivia Beavers and Mike Lillis write</a>, while the four witnesses are by no means new to investigators, they are to the public. With cameras rolling, the hearings will give voters and viewers a peek at the deliberations as both parties wage a high-wattage public relations battle over whether Trump’s actions should force his removal from office.</p>
      <p>Throughout the first week of public hearings, Republicans on Capitol Hill and Trump allies repeatedly argued that the first round of witnesses were only passing along “hearsay” to investigators and that none had any firsthand knowledge, including what the president said in various phone calls. However, that argument could be a tougher sell this week. Vindman and Williams were on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President <b>Volodymyr Zelensky</b>. Vindman in October privately testified to lawmakers about that conversation. </p>

Col. Vindman to describe his alarm over president’s call with Ukrainian leader, girding for Republican attack.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Republicans believe Volker is one witness who could ultimately help Trump’s case. Appearing in private last month before the three investigatory committees, Volker said the White House decision to withhold military aid to Ukraine was “not significant” and that Ukrainian leaders “never communicated a belief that there was a quid pro quo” surrounding the investigations Trump sought. However, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">The New York Times reports</a> that Volker, seeking to square his earlier testimony with information provided to the House by other witnesses, will tell lawmakers today he was out of the loop and did not realize others working for Trump had tied Ukraine military aid to a commitment to investigate Democrats.</p>

      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/470914-dems-looking-at-trumps-possible-mueller-obstruction-in-impeachment">The Hill</a>: Democratic impeachment investigators are looking at whether Trump misled former special counsel <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/robert-mueller">Robert Mueller</a></b>.</p>
      <p>The president said Monday that he will "strongly consider" testifying as part of the House inquiry. This comment comes as his administration continues to stonewall investigators and not cooperate with what they consider a “sham” investigation. Democrats expressed skepticism that Trump might appear (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment/democrats-dubious-as-trump-dangles-impeachment-testimony-offer-idUSKBN1XS1LI">Reuters</a>). </p>
      <p>Trump’s tweet was in response to Speaker <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/nancy-pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a>'s</b> (D-Calif.) suggestion on Sunday that the president should "come right before the committee” to give testimony (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/470886-trump-tweets-he-will-strongly-consider-testifying-in-impeachment">The Hill</a>).</p>
      <p>Elsewhere on the investigation front, Sen. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/ron-johnson">Ron Johnson</a></b> (R-Wis.), a key player on the Ukraine front, responded to a letter from Reps. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/devin-nunes">Devin Nunes</a></b> (R-Calif.) and <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/jim-jordan">Jim Jordan</a></b> (R-Ohio) to provide any firsthand information that is relevant to the ongoing inquiry. In a letter of his own, the Wisconsin Republican, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee, took the opportunity to assail Vindman, arguing he is trying to sabotage the president (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/471008-gop-senator-calls-impeachment-sabotage-effort-raising-questions-about-witness">The Hill</a>). </p>

        <u>LEADING THE DAY</u>
      </p>
      <p><b>POLITICS &amp; CAMPAIGNS: </b>Sen. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a></b> (D-Mass.) is trying to recapture her mojo after losing some polling steam in Iowa amid the rise of South Bend, Ind., Mayor <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/peter-pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a></b>, who sits atop recent surveys of the first-in-the-nation caucus state.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/471004-warren-under-pressure-as-2020-rivals-step-up-attacks">As Julia Manchester reports</a>, Warren will arrive at Wednesday’s Democratic primary debate under heavy attacks from her rivals over her “Medicare for All” plan and continued questions over her viability in a general election setting. Along with the Iowa polling slip, these areas represent a moment of concern for the campaign, which had been riding high in the primary until recently. </p>
      <p>However, it’s her health care proposal that has given her opponents an opening, which they’ve exploited in recent weeks. </p>
      <p><i>“I think her announcing the specifics on the health care plan hurt her, and created an opportunity for Biden, and now also Buttigieg,”</i> said <b>Michael Gordon</b>, a Democratic strategist. <i>“Arguably the best moment for Biden’s campaign thus far was when Warren released her payment plan for Medicare for All. That combined with some of the polls that showed her not doing as well as Biden against Trump in key swing states feels like some of the gas has been taken out of her campaign.</i></p>
      <p>With Warren’s momentum ebbing slightly, the centrist wing of the Democratic Party has found itself on the rise, headlined by Buttigieg’s newly-minted spot as the top dog in the Hawkeye State.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/471010-the-memo-centrists-change-tone-of-democratic-race">As Niall Stanage says in his latest memo on the race</a>, along with Buttigieg’s polling rise, former Massachusetts Gov. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/deval-patrick">Deval Patrick</a> </b>entered the race last week, and former New York City Mayor <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a></b> is poised to do so in the near future. In addition, former <b>President Obama</b> issued a warning to his party against overestimating the American public’s appetite for sweeping change.</p>
      <p>Those developments, all coming in quick succession, have changed the mood music around a primary that had previously been dominated by Warren’s rise and questions about whether Biden’s centrist policies were out of step with the party’s progressive base.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/471013-key-republicans-say-biden-can-break-washington-gridlock">The Hill</a>: Key Republicans say Biden can break Washington gridlock.</p>

      <p><b>Centrists, capitalists and 1 percenters: </b>Warren, who made a reputation in and out of politics as a ferocious critic of large financial and tech firms, weighed in again on Monday, taking on private equity firm Blackstone for what she said was its decision to “shamelessly” profit from the financial crisis in 2008.  </p>
      <p>Warren is an outspoken advocate for consumers, middle- and lower-income borrowers and families, and students who she says are undercut by corporate profiteering, excessive CEO compensation and Wall Street’s focus on satisfying stockholders and investors. The senator<a href="https://apnews.com/7beba97df6c34881b5616d6c8e758726"> has been publicly critical</a> of Facebook, Amazon, Wells Fargo and many of the Democratic-leaning financial titans who bristle at her zeal while she describes them as bad actors.</p>
      <p>Her assertion that Blackstone took advantage of real estate foreclosures to turn a profit during the financial meltdown served as a backdrop for her tenants’ rights plan, which Warren unveiled. It was the latest instance of the Democratic 2020 presidential candidate singling out Wall Street companies and investors by name for actions she says contribute to inequality (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-18/warren-calls-out-blackstone-for-shameless-profits-from-housing">Bloomberg News</a>).</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, recoiling at the anti-capitalist policies and rhetoric of Warren and Sen. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a></b> (I-Vt.), may soon enter the Democratic race in part because he’s so opposed to their approach.</p>
      <p>Patrick, a self-made millionaire and a managing director at Bain Capital, is a late entrant in the presidential race who has endorsed super PACs and has not shied from his advice to wealthy clients.</p>
      <p>Wall Street and other influential CEOs who consider themselves open to Democratic causes and candidates have made no secret of their alarm that Warren has become a top-tier presidential contender in part because of her worries about the influence of big banks and behemoth tech firms.</p>
      <p><b>Lloyd Blankfein, </b>a former Goldman Sachs chief executive who is now a senior chairman, was targeted by Warren in one of her campaign ads as a CEO who “earned $70 million during the financial crisis.” Blankfein shot back, “<i>Vilification of people as a member of a group may be good for her campaign, not the country. Maybe tribalism is just in her DNA”</i> (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-warren-wallstreet/goldmans-blankfein-calls-warrens-criticism-of-billionaires-tribalism-idUSKBN1XO2LA">Reuters)</a>.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO and chairman <b>Jamie Dimon</b> told CBS News’s “60 Minutes” that he’s not enamored with Warren’s rhetoric but doesn’t want to single her out: <i>“</i><i>Anything that vilifies people I just don't like. I think, you know, most people are good, not all of 'em. I think you should vilify Nazis, but you shouldn't vilify people who worked hard to accomplish things. And so my comment is, I think it's American society — we're just attacking each other all the time” </i>(<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jamie-dimon-jp-morgan-chase-ceo-the-60-minutes-interview-2019-11-10/">CBS News</a>).</p>
      <p>Pressed to comment on his recent JPMorgan raise to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/18/jp-morgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-gets-raise-to-31-million.html">$31 million</a>, Dimon called America’s wage gap a “huge problem.”</p>

        <u>IN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES</u>
      </p>
      <p><b>WHITE HOUSE &amp; ADMINISTRATION: </b>Secretary of State <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/mike-pompeo">Mike Pompeo</a></b> announced on Monday that the United States is softening its position on <b>Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank</b>, the latest administration decision that weakens Palestinian claims to achieve statehood. “<i>Calling the establishment of civilian settlements inconsistent with international law has not advanced the cause of peace,”</i> Pompeo said. <i>“The hard truth is that there will never be a judicial resolution to the conflict, and arguments about who is right and who is wrong as a matter of international law will not bring peace.”</i> U.S. actions that have eroded Palestinian efforts to achieve statehood include Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the movement of the U.S. Embassy to that city and the closure of the Palestinian diplomatic office in Washington (<a href="https://apnews.com/3da4fb3671004679a91a7d4ae9ab4e57">The Associated Press</a>).</p>
      <p><b>Prisoner release</b>: Pompeo and the State Department helped facilitate the prisoner swaps completed today of American <b>Kevin King</b> and Australian <b>Timothy Weeks</b>, who were kidnapped by the Taliban in 2016 outside the American University of Kabul, where they were instructors. They were released today after days of delay, completing an exchange with the Taliban for three rebels commandos who had been held at Bagram prison (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/three-taliban-militants-flown-to-qatar-hinting-at-possible-prisoner-swap/2019/11/19/9ea56ed0-0a8b-11ea-8054-289aef6e38a3_story.html">The Washington Post)</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Trump and Federal Reserve</b>: The president met at the White House on Monday with Fed Chairman <b>Jerome Powell</b>. Trump’s frequent critiques of the central bank’s monetary choices and Powell’s leadership are well known, but the president hailed a “cordial” exchange to start the week (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/470903-trump-cheers-cordial-meeting-with-fed-chairman">The Hill</a>). </p>
      <p><b>Electromagnetic pulse risks</b>: Worries about nuclear weapons zapping America's electric grid will return to the administration’s policy fringe following recent staff turnover at the National Security Council. The utility industry has resisted hardening the grid against potential electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks because of the high cost of addressing what the industry (and mainstream scientists) consider an unlikely threat (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/18/is-it-lights-out-for-trumps-emp-push-071359">Politico</a>). </p>
      <p><b>Commerce Department &amp; tech</b>: The Trump administration has extended for 90 more days a limited reprieve on <b>U.S. technology sales to Huawei</b>, the Chinese tech company blacklisted as a national security risk by the U.S. government in May. U.S. firms aren’t allowed to sell technology to Huawei without government approval. The limited reprieve renewed on Monday applies to technology sales and transfers necessary for existing networks and services to continue to operate. It was not unexpected and represents the second such extension (<a href="https://apnews.com/0a6b3c6a56744309a099b89e163f565b">The Associated Press</a>). Meanwhile, the Federal Communications Commission is expected to vote on proposals to halt purchases by U.S. telecom companies of Huawei equipment using the FCC’s Universal Service Fund (<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/470950-trump-officials-extend-deadline-to-allow-companies-to-work-with-huawei">The Hill</a>)<b>.</b></p>
