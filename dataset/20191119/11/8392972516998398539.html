      <p>TV's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/">Piers Morgan</a> has continued his 'feud' with <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec Donnelly</a> after they made a dig about him on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a>.</p>
      <p>During Sunday night's launch episode, the duo couldn't resist poking fun at Piers when they introduced his <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a> co-star Kate Garraway as a campmate.</p>
      <p>Dec told viewers that Kate would be facing the "most harrowing ordeal of her entire life" to which Ant quipped: "But before she goes back to work with Piers Morgan, she's got three weeks in the jungle!"</p>
