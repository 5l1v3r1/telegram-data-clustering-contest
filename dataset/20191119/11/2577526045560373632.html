      <h1>Jeff Kaplan Says "Nothing Would Make Me Happier" Than Bringing Link to Overwatch</h1>

      <p>Blizzard has been pretty vocal about its desire to see <i>Overwatch</i> characters brought over to <i>Super Smash Bros Ultimate</i>, but what might that crossover look like the other way around? In a quickfire interview with <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/video-interview/2019/11/15/110-rapid-fire-questions-with-overwatch-2s-jeff-kaplan">Game Informer</a> (via <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/jeff_kaplan_answers_which_nintendo_character_hed_most_like_to_see_in_overwatch_2">Nintendo Life</a>), game director Jeff Kaplan revealed which Nintendo character he’d like to see join the cast of his hero shooter.</p>
      <p>After reiterating his desire to put Tracer in Smash, Kaplan was asked which Smash Bros character he’d like to see in <i>Overwatch</i>. His response was emphatic, declaring that “nothing would make me happier than putting Link into our game.”</p>
      <p>Sadly, The Hero of Hyrule will probably never make it to <i>Overwatch</i>, but there is something that fills the aching void that knowledge leaves in our hearts. Earlier this year, a group of artists put together a trailer that showed what Link might look like in one of <a href="https://vimeo.com/361117605?utm_campaign=2617611&amp;utm_source=affiliate&amp;utm_channel=affiliate&amp;cjevent=3946f7bc0abc11ea82a803430a180514">Blizzard’s character trailers</a>. He comes across a little like Brigitte, which is probably just another of myriad reasons he won’t be making it into the game, but hey, we can all dream, right?</p>
