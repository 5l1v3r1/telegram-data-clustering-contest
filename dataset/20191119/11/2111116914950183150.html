      <p>This year's <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/amazon-black-friday-deals-2019">Amazon Black Friday deals</a> are nearly here, but if you've been thinking about investing in a home security camera setup there's no need to wait – you can already get a great deal on this two-camera Blink XT2 system.</p>
      <p>Blink, owned by Amazon, already offers some of the best value security cameras around, and this price makes them even more appealing. Unlike previous Blink devices, this pair offer two-way audio, so you can hear and speak to anyone who triggers their motion sensors using the Blink app on your phone or tablet.</p>
      <p>The motion detection is smart too, so you can choose which zones are monitored and only receive notifications when the cameras detect movement there. They also work with Alexa, so if you own an <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/amazon-echo-show-5">Amazon Echo Show</a> or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/amazon-echo-spot">Echo Spot</a>, you can simple say 'Alexa, show me the front door camera' to see who's waiting to be let in.</p>
      <p>Both cameras are robust and weatherproof, so you can mount them indoors or outside, and they'll capture crisp footage night and day. They're completely wireless, so setup is effortless, and there's no monthly subscription fee to worry about. What could be easier?</p>

      <p>If you only need to keep an eye on the inside of your home, Amazon has also slashed the price of indoor Blink camera kits. These are available with one, three or five cameras, and if that's not enough you can also pick up extra cameras individually to cover extra rooms.</p>
      <p>You don't get two-way voice communication with these cameras, and they're suitable for indoor use only, but with prices starting at just £60, these are likely to be some of the most affordable home security starter kits we'll see this year.</p>
