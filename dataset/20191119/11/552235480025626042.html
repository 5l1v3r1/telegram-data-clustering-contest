      <p>An Airdrie couple have boosted a charity’s coffers by a further £2050 after holding their third annual fundraiser.</p>
      <p>Every year since their son Paul, 25, passed away following a brave battle with rare genetic disorder Angelman syndrome, Teresa and Gordon Robertson have organised a charity night in Airdrie working men’s club.</p>
      <p>The generous duo decided to take up this fundraising challenge to “give something back” to Children’s Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS) for the “invaluable support” they gave to Paul and their family.</p>
      <p>And, for the third year in a row, the latest entertainment-packed evening collected an impressive four-figure sum.</p>
      <p>The event included music, dance, bingo and a prize raffle and grateful Teresa was quick to show her appreciation to everyone who helped put it together.</p>
      <p>She told the Advertiser: “We had another great turnout and the night went extremely well.</p>

      <p>“We’d like to thank our friends and family, local businesses in Chapelhall, Airdrie and Coatbridge – including garages, hair, nail and barber salons, Morrisons, Co-op, Asda, our local butchers, chemist, post office and fish shop, hotels and restaurants – for donating prizes for our raffle and bingo.</p>
      <p>“We couldn’t have put on such a successful charity event without these kind and wonderful people.</p>
      <p>“The final total was also boosted by £800 which my fabulous daughter raised by taking part in a half-marathon.”</p>
      <p>Only one in up to 20,000 people are diagnosed with Angelman syndrome, which affects the nervous system with symptoms including “severe intellectual disability, developmental disability, speech problems, balance and movement problems, seizures, and sleep problems”.</p>
      <p>Teresa and Gordon showed tireless dedication to looking after Paul throughout his life and met significant challenges head-on.</p>
      <p>But the support from CHAS helped give the couple some “much-needed respite”.</p>
