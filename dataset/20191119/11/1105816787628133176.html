      <p>The release of the hostages came a week after President Ashraf Ghani announced that Afghanistan would free three high-ranking Taliban prisoners in a swap he hoped would help jumpstart peace talks.</p>
      <p>According to an official who spoke to <i>AFP</i>, the two American University professors were released in Nawbahar district of Zabul province and were flown out on American helicopters.</p>
      <p>The American and Australian were exchanged with three insurgent leaders, including a key militant figure, Anas Haqqani.</p>
      <p><i>Reuters </i>reported that the three Taliban commanders part of the prisoner swap had landed in Qatar earlier on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“Our three prisoners had been freed on Monday night,” said one of the sources, a senior Taliban leader in Afghanistan, who declined to be identified because he was not authorised to speak publicly about the deal.</p>
      <p>“Soon after their release, they were flown to Doha and handed over to the political office in Qatar.”</p>
