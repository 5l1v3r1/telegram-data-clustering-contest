      <p>The company has announced is partnering with Hackster.io for an <a href="https://www.hackster.io/contests/NVIDIA">AI at the Edge</a> challenge – participants have to use a <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit">Jetson Nano Developer Kit</a> to create a “unique AI solution”. I’m a bit late to the party, however, as the Applications for Hardware deadline has already passed.</p>
      <h3>AI</h3>
      <p>But for the board itself – launched earlier this year – Nvidia is highlighting that AI is available for makers and learners – as well as professional embedded developers – for $99. You can see an introduction video below.</p>
      <blockquote>“NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit is a small, powerful computer that lets you run multiple neural networks in parallel for applications like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and speech processing. All in an easy-to-use platform that runs in as little as 5 watts,” the company writes.<br/><br/>“It’s simpler than ever to get started! Just insert a microSD card with the system image, boot the developer kit, and begin using the same NVIDIA JetPack SDK used across the entire NVIDIA Jetson family of products. JetPack is compatible with NVIDIA’s world-leading AI platform for training and deploying AI software, reducing complexity and effort for developers.”</blockquote>

      <p>Nvidia is increasingly focused on AI, as readers of this website will know. Our recent lead story was <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/nvidia-looks-conversational-ai-2019-11/">Nvidia looks to conversational AI</a>, for example, covering the company’s quarterly results.</p>
      <h3>Jetson Nano specification</h3>
      <p>The full technical specs or the AI devout are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>GPU: 128-core Maxwell</li>
        <li>CPU: Quad-core ARM A57 @ 1.43 GHz</li>
        <li>Memory: 4 GB 64-bit LPDDR4 25.6 GB/s</li>
        <li>Storage microSD (not included)</li>
        <li>Video Encode: 4K @ 30 | 4x 1080p @ 30 | 9x 720p @ 30 (H.264/H.265)</li>
        <li>Video Decode: 4K @ 60 | 2x 4K @ 30 | 8x 1080p @ 30 | 18x 720p @ 30 (H.264/H.265)</li>
        <li>Camera: 1x MIPI CSI-2 DPHY lanes</li>
        <li>Connectivity: Gigabit Ethernet, M.2 Key E</li>
        <li>Display: HDMI 2.0 and eDP 1.4</li>
        <li>USB: 4x USB 3.0, USB 2.0 Micro-B</li>
        <li>Others: GPIO, I2C, I2S, SPI, UART</li>
        <li>Mechanical: 69 mm x 45 mm, 260-pin edge connector</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Developer Kit contents comprise the NVIDIA Jetson Nano module and carrier board, a small paper card with quick start and support information and a folded paper stand.</p>
      <p>In terms of software, you would develop with the NVIDIA JetPack SDK and the NVIDIA DeepStream analytics toolkit for AI-based video and image understanding (with the NVIDIA Isaac SDK as the developer toolbox for accelerating the development and deployment of AI-powered robots).</p>
      <p>The devkit <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit">website</a> provides guides and example developments.</p>
      <p>Good luck, if you have already entered!</p>
