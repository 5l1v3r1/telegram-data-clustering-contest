      <p>Accra, Nov 19, GNA - The Member of Parliament for Tema West, Carlos Kingsley Ahenkorah, has stated that the 2020 Budget fulfills another noteworthy campaign promise of President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.</p>
      <p>He said the Budget had proven that when President Akufo-Addo and Dr. Bawumia said the then NDC Government of John Mahama was relying cluelessly on taxes as a lazy man’s approach to economic governance, they were right.</p>
      <p>“As is well known by everybody, the Finance Ministry did not introduce new taxes in this budget. What this means is that, we have now cleaned up the messy situation that the previous government left and are ready to sail at the NPP’s own speed now,” Mr Ahenkorah who is also a Deputy Minister of Trade, said in a statement copied to the Ghana News Agency in Accra on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>According to him, President Akufo-Addo had just switched the governance into the next gear, where he would prove that when he said that it was possible to develop without too many taxes, he meant it.</p>
      <p>“Ghanaians must really open their eyes now and take everything that the President does in good faith. he is about to show our incompetent friends on the other side, the power of competence. Already, I think the Budget has set the stage.</p>
      <p>“Come 2020, no new taxes are going to be introduced, but we are going to build more roads, we are going to build more hospitals and we are going to complete many of the projects that the NDC could not complete; without new taxes” .</p>
      <p>Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta presented the 2020 Budget last week and announced to the pleasant surprise of Ghanaians that the Government would not introduce any new taxes in 2020.</p>
      <p>Without the new taxes, the Budget allocated huge sums of money towards roads, with Ken Ofori-Atta describing 2020 as a year for the roads.</p>
      <p>Already, government has paid outstanding sums owed all road contractors after an evaluation of contracts awarded by the previous government and asked them to return to the various road projects they were working on and complete them.</p>
