      <p>The updated lyrics did not sit well with everyone. Teigen recently dropped by “The Kelly Clarkson Show” and told those critics to “get over it.”</p>
      <p>“Sharon assumed you guys like burned them all in the backyard or something and that they can never listen to the original ever again,” Teigen told Clarkson. “If I can’t have my creepy song, it’s not Christmas. I want date-rapey songs.”</p>

      <p>“I’m not offendable, like I hear it all. It’s hard to offend me,” Teigen said. “I wasn’t mad about the song, I don’t care what you guys do, but to be like ‘Ugh, I hate this now.’”</p>
      <p>The supermodel concluded with this sentiment: “Oh, my God, get over it… Go off, Sharon.”</p>
