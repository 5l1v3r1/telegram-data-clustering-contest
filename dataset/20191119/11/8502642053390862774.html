      <h2>Soybeans, Grains Slightly Higher Overnight; Export Inspects of Corn, Beans Improve.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:56:58+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.agriculture.com/author/tony-dreibus" target="_blank">Tony Dreibus</a></address>
      <h3>1. Soybeans, Corn Modestly Higher in Overnight Trading</h3>
      <p>Soybeans and corn were slightly higher in overnight trading as a USDA report showed the harvest still has a ways to go before being finished and on guarded optimism about trade. </p>
      <p>About 91% of the soybean crop was collected as of Sunday, but that was only up 6 percentage points week to week, the USDA said in a report. At this time of the year, about 95% has normally been harvested.</p>
      <p>The corn harvest was well behind normal at 76%, up from 66% a week earlier but trailing the average pace of 92% for this time of year, the agency said in its report.</p>
      <p>Only 77% of Iowa corn was in the bin to start the week vs. the prior five-year average of 93%. In Illinois, 80% was collected vs. the normal 97%, the USDA said.</p>
      <p>Winter wheat planting, meanwhile, is right on schedule with 95% in the ground. In Kansas, the biggest producer of the variety, 98% was seeded as of Sunday, in line with the average. About 83% of the crop had emerged as of Sunday, a bit behind the normal 86% for this time of year.</p>
      <p>Market-watchers continue to keep an eye on developments in the ongoing U.S.-China trade saga. Officials reportedly said recent trade talks were “constructive,” which buoyed global markets yesterday, but that’s become a common refrain from trade negotiators.</p>
      <p>News has been sparse in recent days despite both sides indicating in October that a trade deal was all but complete.</p>
      <p>Soybean futures for January delivery rose 1¾¢ to $9.12 a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soy meal rose 80¢ to $302 a short ton, while soybean oil added 0.21¢ to 30.85¢ a pound.</p>
      <p>Corn futures for December delivery rose 1¢ to $3.68¾ a bushel.</p>
      <p>Wheat for September delivery added ½¢ to $5.07¾ a bushel, while Kansas City futures rose 1¢ to $4.27¼ a bushel.</p>

      <h3>2. Export Inspections of Corn, Beans Rise Week to Week, Wheat Assessments Decline</h3>
      <p>Inspections of corn and soybeans for overseas delivery rose in the seven days that ended on November 14 while wheat assessments declined, according to the USDA.</p>
      <p>The government inspected 637,397 metric tons of corn for offshore delivery last week, up from 581,856 tons the previous week. The total was still below the 845,957 tons examined at the same time in 2018.</p>
      <p>Soybean assessments also improved, rising to 1.53 million metric tons from 1.35 million tons the prior week and 1.11 million tons during the same week a year earlier, the agency said.</p>
      <p>Wheat inspections, meanwhile, declined to 449,304 metric tons last week from 539,724 tons a week earlier. That also was down from the 509,900 tons assessed in the same week in 2018.</p>
      <p>Since the start of the marketing year on September 1, the government has inspected 4.98 million metric tons of corn for overseas delivery, less than half the 12 million tons assessed during the same period last year, the USDA said.</p>
      <p>Examinations of soybeans for offshore delivery, however, are up at 12.4 million tons from 11.1 million at this point in 2018.</p>
      <p>Wheat inspections since the start of the grain’s marketing year on June 1 are now at 11.9 million metric tons, up from the 9.82 million tons assessed at this time a year earlier, the agency said.</p>

      <h3>3. Snow Continues in Parts of Southern Minnesota, Wisconsin; Storm Heads For North Dakota</h3>
      <p>Snow will continue to fall in parts of southern Minnesota and southern Wisconsin this morning, but only minor accumulations are expected in the region, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
      <p>Temperatures are hovering just at or below freezing, which could lead to some slippery surfaces, the NWS said in a report early this morning.</p>
      <p>Accumulations are expected to be about ½ inch or less into central Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>Farther west, as much as 6 inches of snow is expected to fall in parts of North Dakota overnight into Wednesday, the agency said.</p>
      <p>The same storm system will bring a mix of snow and light freezing rain, or possibly freezing drizzle, to areas of southern North Dakota, the NWS said.</p>
      <p>Snow and freezing rain are expected to continue into Wednesday and Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>“Uncertainty remains on how widespread the freezing precipitation will be, but the treat of ice accumulations” continues into tomorrow, the agency said in its report.</p>
