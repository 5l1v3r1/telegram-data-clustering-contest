      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bank-of-baroda">Bank of Baroda </a>on Tuesday said the RBI has imposed Rs 2.50 crore fine for non-compliance of directions issued to it with regard to Bihar-based NGO Srijan Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samiti Ltd.</p>
      <p>"The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/reserve-bank-of-india">Reserve Bank of India </a>in exercise of powers conferred under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, has imposed a penalty aggregating to Rs 2.50 crore on the bank for non-compliance with the directions issued by the RBI in various accounts of Srijan Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samiti Ltd at Bhagalpur Branch," <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bank-of-baroda">Bank of Baroda </a>said in a regulatory filing.</p>
      <p>The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is probing the matter in the Rs 1,000 crore scam allegedly involving Bihar-based NGO Srijan Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samiti and government officers.</p>
      <p>Unidentified officers of Bank of Baroda, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indian-bank">Indian Bank </a>and the 'Samiti' have been named as accused in the FIRs registered for alleged criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery among others.</p>
      <p>Besides, FIRs have also been registered in Patna and Delhi.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that there was illegal transfer and misuse of funds from government accounts in Bhagalpur district to accounts of the Samiti through a conspiracy hatched between government officials and office bearers of the NGO.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that the NGO, which was working towards imparting training to women, had pilfered government funds in connivance with the bank officials and state government officials between 2003 and 2014.</p>
      <p>As per initial probe by local police, the Samiti allegedly procured cheque books from <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/finance-news-banks-1030101.htm">banks </a>and forged signature of the district magistrate to transfer government funds to its account.</p>
