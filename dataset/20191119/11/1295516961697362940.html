      <p>Although there <a href="https://www.cbr.com/henry-cavill-exits-superman/">have been reports</a> Henry Cavill would not reprise his role as <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/superman-film/">Superman</a> in the DC Extended Universe following <i>Justice League</i>, the actor says he isn't ready to give up the part yet.</p>
      <p>"I’m not just going to sit quietly in the dark as all this stuff is going on," Cavill told <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29774618/henry-cavill-the-witcher-superman-interview/">Men's Health</a>. "I’ve not given up the role. There’s a lot I have to give for Superman yet. A lot of storytelling to do. A lot of real, true depths to the honesty of the character I want to get into. I want to reflect the comic books. That’s important to me. There’s a lot of justice to be done for Superman. The status is: You’ll see."</p>

      <p>Cavill first played Clark Kent/Superman in 2013's <i>Man of Steel</i>. He later reprised his role for <i>Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice </i>and <i>Justice League</i>. However, the latter performed poorly at the box office, leaving his future as the character in doubt. <a href="https://www.cbr.com/warner-bros-ben-affleck-henry-cavill-recast/">Reports from 2018 claimed</a> Warner Bros. was looking to move away from Ben Affleck -- who eventually did give up his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman -- and Cavill. However, <i>Aquaman </i>star <a href="https://www.cbr.com/henry-cavill-not-departing-superman-says-jason-momoa/">Jason Momoa</a> and <a href="https://www.cbr.com/henry-cavill-manager-superman-statement/">Cavill's manager</a> disputed reports the actor would no longer play Superman.</p>
      <p>Although Cavill was originally intended to have a cameo at the end of <i>Shazam!</i>, the actor was not able to appear due to commitments to <i>Mission: Impossible - Fallout</i>. At this time, it's unknown when Cavill will next play Superman in the DCEU, as he's currently set to play Geralt of Rivia on Netflix's upcoming adaptation of <i>The Witcher</i>.</p>
      <p>Next up for the DC Extended Universe is Cathy Yan's <i>Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)</i>, slated for release Feb. 7, 2020; Patty Jenkins' <i>Wonder Woman 1984</i>, coming June 5 2020; James Gunn's <i>The Suicide Squad</i>, which arrives August 6, 2021; and Matt Reeves' solo <i>Batman </i>film, which will swing into theaters June 25, 2021.</p>
