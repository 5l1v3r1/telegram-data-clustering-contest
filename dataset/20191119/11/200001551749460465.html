      <h1>West Ham director likely to be key in pursuit of player – Patience may be needed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:33:41+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/nihat-emre-kocaaslan/" target="_blank">Nihat Emre Kocaaslan</a></address>
      <p>West Ham United’s interest in Olympiacos goalkeeper Jose Sa is dominating the sport headlines in Greece, but it’s reported a move to the Premier League side in January is looking unlikely.</p>
      <p>Manuel Pellegrini doesn’t currently have Lukasz Fabianski available and his replacement Roberto has failed to convince. Subsequently there have been recent claims the Hammers could look to move in on Jose Sa in the new year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sdna.gr/podosfairo/660637_ti-ishyei-me-ton-zose-sa-kai-tin-goyest-ham">Sdna.Gr</a> report West Ham sporting director Mario Husillos could be a factor in their pursuit of Jose Sa due to his connections with his former club Olympiacos, but they say this doesn’t necessarily mean the player will join the London club during the next window.</p>
      <p>It’s reported West Ham are only looking to sign players in the summer and not January, meaning the arrival of Jose Sa is unlikely at this stage.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportime.gr/bloggers/agent-greek/zose-sa-den-polite-tora-to-kalokeri-omos/">Sportime</a> also report the player’s agent Jorge Mendes and Olympiacos can’t agree on a move in January and a transfer is more likely to happen at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Olympiacos made Jose Sa’s move from Porto permanent in the summer for €2.5m, and the 26 year old has been in excellent form this season.</p>
      <p>He’s under contract with the Greek club until June 2023.</p>
