      <p>Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh are undoubtedly the Internet’s favorite. After dating each other for 6 years, the couple surprised one and all with their sudden wedding announcement last November. DeepVeer, as fondly called by their fans, dashed off to Lake Como, Italy to solemnize their wedding. Every time Deepika and Ranveer post a picture together, <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/ranveer-singh-gets-a-facial-and-hair-spa-for-his-first-wedding-anniversary-deepika-padukone-approves/5dcbb76787fb571eff7e3c91">they unintentionally send out major relationship goals</a>, like their latest picture.</p>
      <p>A while back, Deepika Padukone took to social media to share a cute picture of husband Ranveer Singh. But before you beam with joy let us tell you that the picture does not consist of Deepika and even the '83 actor is partially visible. It’s the actress’ caption that is melting our hearts. The snap sees Ranveer's back facing the camera while wearing an orange T-Shirt. The quote on the T-Shirt reads, “Love is a super power.” Sharing the picture on her Instagram account, Deepika crossed all levels of being a romantic wife as she calls her husband, “My super drug,” in the caption.
