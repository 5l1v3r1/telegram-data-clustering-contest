      <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <p>League leaders Liverpool travel to Selhurst Park to take on Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's men sit atop the table with an eight-point lead over second-placed Leicester City and a nine-point lead over fellow title favourites Manchester City.</p>
      <p>A victory over Palace would heap even more pressure on City, who play later the same day - against Chelsea.</p>
      <h3>When is it?</h3>
      <p>Saturday, November 23.</p>
      <h3>What time is kick-off?</h3>
      <p>3pm GMT.</p>
      <h3>What TV channel is it on?</h3>
      <p>Because this game is a 3pm kick-off it won't be shown live in the UK. However, you can still follow all the action with us - courtesy of our live blog - if you bookmark this page.</p>

        <li>Draw - 7/2</li>
        <li>Liverpool - 4/9</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What's our prediction?</h3>
      <p>Crystal Palace are on a run of four league games without a win, losing three of them, while Liverpool are yet to taste defeat this season in the Premier League. The Reds will slip up at some point, but it seems unlikely to be here.<br/><b>Predicted score:</b> Crystal Palace 0 Liverpool 3.</p>
