      <p>Starting on November 22 for 15 nights, Ickworth is inviting visitors to explore the gothic nature of its Victorian Stumpery as the gnarled roots are lit up and sounds of nature at night follow. Against the backdrop of the 18th century Rotunda, evergreen trees will also be lit to celebrate Ickworth's formal gardens in a completely new way.</p>
      <p>Jack Lindfield, assistant head gardener said: "We are really looking forward to Ickworth's Light Nights, it's been something that we have wanted to do for a few years now and feel the Stumpery lends itself perfectly to this type of experience.</p>
      <p>"The stumpery was created with trees that were uprooted during the Second World War, when fields were sown for 'Dig to Victory'. The Stumpery has a very secretive feel about it, hidden within the evergreen backdrop of the Italianate garden, this concealed gem boasts a significant amount of planting and structure.</p>
      <p>"Everyone who walks through the stumpery finds different elements that they like. For me it's the contrast between the gnarled and dark stumps against the delicate and verdant planting, working together to create a very natural yet moody feel. It also has plenty of nods to the grandeur Italianate garden with its evergreen foliage and its enclosed, grotto like pathways.</p>
      <p>"We can't wait to see how it looks in the evening, transformed by light and sound."</p>
      <p>Ickworth will also be serving artisan food and drinks from the West Wing Caf√© and keeping the gift shop open until late to give visitors a chance to make the most of their evening out and start those festive celebrations.</p>
      <p>Tickets are available with allocated entry time slots, but visitors are free to spend as long as they would like exploring the garden and Light Nights experience.</p>
