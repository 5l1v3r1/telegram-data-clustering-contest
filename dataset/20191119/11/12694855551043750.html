      <p>Samsung’s answer to Apple’s ever-popular Apple Watch Series, Samsung delivers a very attractive wearable that, more importantly, sits in a far more affordable price bracket. With a circular design, reminiscent of more classic designed analogue watches, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active also boasts a stunning AMOLED screen that showcases bright, brilliant colours – now making it one of the most affordable AMOLED smartwatches on the market, for a limited time of course.</p>
      <p>Just like every other smartwatch turned fitness tracker, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active can also keep close tab on your daily movements, allowing you to track the exercise you do and the number of steps you take as you work towards your fitness goals. It can also receive incoming notifications, alerting you to texts, calls and emails, easily accessible at your wrist.</p>
      <p>With GPS built-in and the ability to store up to 4GB of music, this is a great companion for runners, allowing you to leave your phone behind. This wearable also offers the ability to monitor your sleep and carry out breathing exercises with its helpful blood pressure reading technology to ensure reduced stress levels. Even better, for keen swimmers, you can also take the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active for a dip with water resistance up to 1.5 metres for up to 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>A great choice for those trying to switch up to a more active lifestyle, there’s no time like the present to purchase the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active, now reduced to the fantastically affordable price of £169, the cheapest its ever been on Amazon.</p>
