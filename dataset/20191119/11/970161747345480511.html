      <p>Bradley Walsh has announced there’s a huge ‘shake-up’ coming up on The Chase as the ITV quiz show could be recruiting a batch of new quiz champions.</p>
      <p>As it stands, Jenny ‘The Vixen’ Ryan, Paul ‘The Sinnerman’ Sinha, Mark ‘The Beast’ Labbett, Anne ‘The Governess’ Hegerty and Shaun ‘The Dark Destroyer’ Wallace are the Chasers putting teams of four through their paces every day.</p>
      <p>Host <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/chases-bradley-walsh-announces-brand-new-chaser-signed-join-jenny-ryan-team-11077550/">Bradley previously confirmed they would be joined by a sixth Chaser</a>, but now the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a> star has warned there may be a new slew of geniuses arriving imminently.</p>
      <p>‘We’re making more and more shows all the time, so we need to recruit more people all the time,’ he told Radio Times.</p>

      <p>‘So consequently, we have put our feelers out to find other people that will be suitable, and all will be revealed next year.’</p>
      <p>And the 59-year-old all but promised there will be several new recruits. When pushed if there will be more than one new brain box joining the cast, he added: ‘It could be more than one, who knows. But it’s a proper shake-up.’</p>

      <p>Bradley let slip The Chase was evolving in its 10th year during a recent appearance on Good Morning Britain.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a great format, we have great fun. You know we don’t really use autocue, so we fly with it,’ he beamed. ‘We play the game, that’s what’s brilliant about the show, it’s accessible and people love it.’</p>
      <p>‘It’s 10-years-old now, what can we say?’ the presenter continued. ‘We’ve got a brand new chaser coming in for another new series. It just goes on and on.’</p>
