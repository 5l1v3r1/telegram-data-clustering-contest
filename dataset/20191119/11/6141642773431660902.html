      <h1>Increased lighting for Gorey after rape?</h1>
      <h2>EXTRA street lighting could be installed in Grouville after a teenager was raped at a bus stop last month.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:09:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:09</time> by <a rel="author">Jack Maguire</a></address>
      <p>Constable John Le Maistre has held talks with Infrastructure Minister Kevin Lewis, who said feasibility studies on introducing extra lighting in and around the Gorey Common bus stop are due to be carried out.</p>
      <p>Parish Deputy Carolyn Labey said she would like to see ‘appropriate, low-level lighting installed in the village, at bus stops and at public buildings’ such as near the Gorey Youth Club on Chemin des Maltières.</p>
      <p>And mother-of-four and Grouville resident Laura Cranie (38) has also set up a petition calling for extra lighting in the area. Mrs Crainie, whose children are 17, 15, six and four, said as a mother a lack of lighting in the area has always been a concern.</p>
      <p>‘I have always lived in town or St Saviour or St Clement before Grouville so a lack of lighting has not been a problem. I would always urge my daughter to get dropped off at the door and now following what’s happened it’s made everyone uneasy in the parish,’ she said. To date, almost 200 people have signed the petition.</p>
      <p>Mrs Cranie said there were also road safety concerns because of the current lack of lighting.</p>
      <p>The States police are still investigating the rape of a teenage girl at the Gorey Common bus stop. An e-fit of the alleged attacker has been shared and posted to every home in Grouville and St Martin.</p>
      <p>Officers still want to speak to anyone who was in the area between 11.30pm on Thursday 31 October and 12.30am on Friday 1 November. Anyone with any information is urged to contact the police on 612214 or 612612. Calls can also be made to Crimestoppers on 0800555111.</p>
      <p>Deputy Lewis said: ‘In particular we are looking at that particular junction and bus stop [where the rape happened]. There is a very fine line because we often get accused of urbanising the countryside so there has been resistance against street lighting in the past but safety always takes priority.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, sexual abuse support charity Jersey Action Against Rape is due to hold a walk called Take Back the Night tomorrow to show solidarity with victims of sexual violence.</p>
      <p>The walk is due to start at 6pm in the Royal Square and Deputy Inna Gardiner and Annalis Bale, a JAAR committee member, are due to talk. Anyone is welcome to attend.</p>
