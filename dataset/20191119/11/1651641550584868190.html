      <p>A couple of days ago, we <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-blocks-windows-10-1909-update-on-pcs-with-old-realtek-bluetooth-radio-drivers/">reported </a>that users with old Realtek Bluetooth Radio drivers have been blocked from receiving the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/windows-10-november-2019-update-now-available-for-download/">Windows 10 November 2019 Update</a>. Now, it looks like Microsoft has finally resolved the issue with Realtek as the updates are unblocked for users.</p>
      <p>According to Microsoft’s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-information/status-windows-10-1909#225msgdesc">support document</a> (<i>via <a href="https://thewincentral.com/windows-10-1909-update-available-for-users-with-realtek-bluetooth-radio-as-microsoft-removes-safeguard-hold/">The WinCentral</a></i>), Windows 10 PCs with old Realtek Bluetooth Radio drivers should expect November updates to show up within 48 hours. Earlier today, Microsoft made the November 2019 Update available for both <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/windows-10-1909november-2019-update-is-now-available-via-windows-10-update-assistant/">Update Assistant</a> and <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-is-now-rolling-out-windows-10-november-update-to-more-devices/">Media Creation Tool</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>This issue was resolved with an updated driver for the affected Realtek Bluetooth radio and the safeguard hold has been removed. Please note, it can take up to 48 hours before you can update to offered Windows 10, version 1909 or Windows 10, version 1903.</blockquote>
      <p>With the issue sorted out, users can freely upgrade to November 2019 Update as there are no known issues affecting the update at the moment.</p>
