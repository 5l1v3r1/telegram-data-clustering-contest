      <p>Lorraine Kelly shocked the nation when she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/lorraine-kelly-slams-jennifer-arcuri-face-not-answering-questions-good-morning-britain-11173682/">brutally confronted Jennifer Arcuri on Good Morning Britain yesterday</a> for ‘not answering questions’ about her former relationship with prime minister <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a>.</p>
      <p>And now, the Scottish presenter has addressed the savage head-to-head with the businesswoman in conversation with Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid.</p>
      <p>‘It doesn’t happen every day. It only happens now and again,’ Lorraine admitted. ‘It’s your fault.’</p>
      <p>‘It’s your fault, Lorraine!’ Susanna replied. ‘You are extraordinary. You launched a missile into the show.’</p>

      <p>Piers commented: ‘When I see the smile’s gone and I see this very severe expression and I see a slight shaking of the shoulders, I realise a salvo is coming.’</p>
      <p>He then suggested a reality television show which sees Lorraine trapped on a desert island with only Jennifer and Esther McVey, and honestly, we’d love to watch it.</p>

      <p>Lorraine didn’t seem too thrilled by the idea and served an almighty eye-roll before Piers asked whether there was anyone she wanted to ‘savage’ today.</p>
      <p>‘No, no, not today,’ Lorraine replied.</p>
      <p>Yesterday’s show saw Lorraine come for Jennifer in unbelievable scenes, as she expressed that she wasn’t satisfied by the guest’s answers.</p>
      <p>‘That was crazy, wasn’t it?’ Lorraine began. ‘What’s the point? Coming down and not answering any questions. What’s the point in that?’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘It just doesn’t make any sense. What’s the point in you coming down and not saying anything? What’s the point in coming on and not saying anything?’</p>
      <p>A confused Jennifer then asked: ‘I’m sorry?’ to which Lorraine repeated her question: ‘What’s the point in you coming on the TV to clear the air and then you don’t say anything?’</p>
      <p>‘I believe I said a few things,’ Jennifer replied. ‘What was it that you were looking for that I didn’t say?’</p>
      <p>We’re still gasping.</p>
