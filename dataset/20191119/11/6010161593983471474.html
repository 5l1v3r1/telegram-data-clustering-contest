      <p>There are only a few hidden letters left to find in the latest season of Fortnite, so here’s where to get your hands on the letter I.</p>
      <p>To unlock this challenge, you’ll need to complete three to four of the <b>Hunter and the Hunted challenges</b> such as landing and getting eliminations at<b> Sweaty Sands</b> or consuming foraged items, like mushrooms.</p>
      <p>For the best chance of finding this letter without being immediately eliminated, you should aim to land at<b> Frenzy Farm</b> right away. If not, make sure you grab a weapon and watch your six.</p>
      <h3>Where to find the letter I</h3>
      <p>To get started, land at <b>Frenzy Farm.</b> You’ll want to land on the roof of the large barn in the Northeast of the area.</p>
      <p>Use your pickaxe to smash your way into the building and head down the stairs. Behind the stairs to the left, you’ll be able to find the letter I spinning on the spot.</p>

      <p>There are a few chests to be found in the area and if you land there first and get an elimination at this location it’ll count towards two other challenges.</p>
