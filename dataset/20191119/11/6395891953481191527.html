      <h1>Home Depot cuts outlook as 3Q revenue misses forecast</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:26:34+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:26</time> by <a rel="author">MICHELLE CHAPMAN, AP Business Writer</a></address>
      <p>Home Depot had a rocky third quarter, with revenue and a key sales figure missing analysts' expectations.</p>
      <p>The home improvement company also cut its forecasts for full-year revenue and comparable sales.</p>
      <p>Shares dropped 5.8% before the market open on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>For the three months ended Nov. 3, Home Depot Inc. earned $2.77 billion, or 2.53 per share. A year earlier, the Atlanta-based company earned $2.87 billion, or $2.51 per share.</p>
      <p>The profit figure met the expectations of analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.</p>
      <p>Revenue, however, totaled $27.22 billion, below the $27.47 billion that Wall Street was looking for.</p>
      <p>Comparable sales rose 3.6%, whereas analysts polled by FactSet had predicted a 4.7% increase.</p>
      <p>Home Depot said it now anticipates fiscal 2019 sales will grow by approximately 1.8% and comparable sales will climb about 3.5%. Its previous guidance was for sales growth of 2.3% and comparable sales growth of 4%.</p>
