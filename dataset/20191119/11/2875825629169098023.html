      <p>West Ham chief David Gold has hit back at Roy Keane for his "shameful" criticism of Hammers midfielder Declan Rice.</p>
      <p>Rice came under fire from Keane for his display in England's 4-0 win in Kosovo on Sunday amid transfer interest from Keane's old club <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old turned his back on Ireland to play for the Three Lions having represented the Boys in Green at various age group levels and winning three senior caps in friendlies.</p>
      <p>And Gold believes that is at the heart of Keane's criticism after the former Sunderland boss labelled him "inconsistent and sloppy".</p>
      <p>Gold told <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> fan site Claret and Hugh: "Keane needs to get over it. Declan made his choice and I think that is what’s behind it as far as Keane is concerned.</p>

      <p>“It’s pretty shameful when a former professional talks the way he did about a young man. It was low, outrageous, unfair and arrogant to pick him out of all the England players.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t even an analysis of the boy who is 20 years old who has barely started his career in the international team for God’s sake.</p>

      <p>“This isn’t the first time he’s done it. In a previous game he said he should be sitting in the studio with the pundits rather than being on the pitch. Shocking!</p>
      <p>"Declan has chosen to play for England and Roy Keane needs to get over that.”</p>
