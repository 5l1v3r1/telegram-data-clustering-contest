      <h2>They have even spat on windows and threatened to harm family pets</h2>

      <p>Cold callers claiming to be "ex-cons" spat on windows and threatened to harm people's pets in a spate of shocking incidents.</p>
      <p>The incidents have been reported in Runcorn, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/warrington">Warrington</a> , Northwich, and Norley.</p>
      <p>There were eight reports in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/runcorn">Runcorn</a> on a single day on Tuesday, October 15.</p>
      <p>Cheshire police said the cold callers claim to be ex-offenders trying to turn their lives around and trying to aggressively sell household items.</p>
      <p>However when they fail to secure a sale they are resorting to spitting on residents’ windows and cars and making threats against their pets lives.</p>

      <p>The latest three reports were made in Lymm, and were over calls made between 2pm and 3pm on Thursday, November 14.</p>
      <p>The cold caller on that occasion was described as a white man, estimated to be in his late 20s and around 6ft tall.</p>
      <p>Enquiries in relation to the incidents are ongoing and the force is appealing for anyone with information regarding the man, or any other cold caller operating without a pedlar’s certificate, to get in touch.</p>
      <p>Residents are asked to report any incidents of cold callers trying to sell them items without the required door-to-door trade certificate, particularly if the offender acts in an aggressive or threatening manner.</p>
      <p>Residents are also urged to not allow themselves to be pressured into buying items from cold callers.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Justin Hancock, of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/cheshire-police">Cheshire Constabulary</a> ’s Force Intelligence Bureau, said: “We work alongside Trading Standards to prevent people from selling items door-to-door without the required licence.</p>
      <p>“The public also has a crucial role to play by reporting such cold callers to us on 101.”</p>
      <p>Details can also be provided <a href="https://www.cheshire.police.uk/contact/general-enquiries">online</a> .</p>

      <p>He added: “We have had a number of reports of cold callers acting in an aggressive manner over the past month.</p>
      <p>“If you are targeted at your home please follow the force’s advice regarding cold callers.”</p>
      <h3>The force’s advice for residents targeted by cold callers is:</h3>
      <p>Do not open the door to stranger, use a door chain if one is available when answering the door.</p>
      <p>If there is not door chain, ask the caller who they are through the door before opening it.</p>
      <p>Do not open the door if they are not expected or not known to the householder.</p>
      <p>If the cold caller tried to sell something, ask to see their pedlar’s certificate – failing to have one is breaking the law when selling items door to door.</p>
      <p>Report doorstep sellers operating without a pedlar’s certificate to Trading Standards and also to the police, particularly if the cold caller acts in an aggressive or threatening manner</p>
      <p>If the items are not wanted, tell the cold caller and re-enter the house.</p>
      <p>Never be pressured into buying something not wanted and never let a cold caller into the house.</p>
