      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/08/marie-kondo-star-netflix-show-tidying-8318511/">Marie Kondo</a> made her name by advising people how to declutter. If it doesn’t ‘spark joy’, get rid of it.</p>
      <p>But now she’s encouraging fans to buy items from her online store.</p>
      <p>The author and TV star has created an online shop with 125 home and self-care products.</p>
      <p><a href="https://konmari.com/konmari-shop/">In a message on her KonMari website</a>, she said that it ‘is a collection of my favourite things and items that spark joy for me.’</p>
      <p>She added that once people declutter their lives, they should add ‘meaningful objects, people and experiences’ into their lives.</p>
      <p>‘Meaningful objects’ in the range include a $52 (£40.21) tea scoop, $24 (£18.56) crumb brush, and a $42 (£32) specifically shaped to carry a bouquet of flowers.</p>

      <p>You can also get $206 (£159) leather room shoes and a $115 (£88) linen kimono robe.</p>
      <p>For $75 (£58), you can get a tuning fork and clear quartz crystal that apparently ‘creates pure tones that help to restore a sense of balance.’</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/marie-kondo-adds-an-e-commerce-shop-to-her-site-11574053200">Speaking to the Wall Street Journa</a>l, Marie said it’s not about replacing the items you already have, but just about showing people what she likes to have in her own home.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘What’s most important to me is that you surround yourself with items that spark joy.</p>

      <p>‘If the bowl that you’re using currently sparks joy for you, I don’t encourage replacing it at all.’</p>
      <p>The post on her website adds that her method isn’t about getting rid of things but realising what is and isn’t giving you joy.</p>
      <p>Speaking about her collection, she added: ‘I hope these items spark joy for you – and for your loved ones! They make beautiful gifts for anyone seeking to establish new routines, elevate their everyday tasks or create a joyful home.</p>
      <p>‘Just remember to complete your tidying and to use that experience to purchase mindfully. My intention is that you will cherish these items and use them for years to come.’</p>
