      <h1>One scoop or two? Police in Rome accused of taking bribes - in the form of free ice cream</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:36:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/nick-squires/" target="_blank">Nick Squires</a></address>
      <p>Police in Rome have been accused of tipping off the owners of restaurants and ice cream parlours to impending visits by health inspectors in return for bribes – of gelato and plates of pasta.</p>
      <p>The gastronomic graft allegedly took place in some of Rome’s best-known tourist spots, from <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/13/rubbish-found-ancient-roman-aqueduct-near-trevi-fountain-highlights/">the Trevi Fountain</a> to the Spanish Steps.</p>
      <p>Three officers from the city’s local police force are being investigated for turning a blind eye to irregularities and passing on information about hygiene controls that could have resulted in large fines.</p>
      <p>In return, they were rewarded with scoops of gelato, plates of spaghetti alla carbonara and free meals.</p>
      <p>The three are all “vigili”, members of a city police force who wear white shirts and white domed helmets, similar to the blue helmets worn by British bobbies.</p>
      <p>They established cosy relationships with gelaterias, bars and restaurants around the Trevi Fountain, in Campo de’ Fiori, a historic piazza, and at the foot of the Spanish Steps in Piazza di Spagna.</p>

      <p>“Be careful, they’re going to pay you a visit,” they told restaurant owners, according to Il Messagero newspaper.</p>
      <p>One officer received a free dinner at a well-known trattoria, with “the promise of two more.”</p>
      <p>Another was able to enjoy ice cream from a gelateria near the Trevi Fountain whenever he liked.</p>
      <p>“We are confident we can explain the whole business in court,” Michele Gentiloni Silveri, a lawyer acting for the officers.</p>
      <p>The collusion emerged from a much broader investigation into the alleged infiltration of the ‘Ndrangheta, the Calabrian mafia, in the historic heart of Rome.</p>
