      <p>“Sunflower” collaborators <b>Post Malone</b> and <b>Swae Lee</b> (of <b>Rae Sremmurd</b>) are about to wrap up <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/post-malone-brought-out-dababy-at-msg-swae-lee-brought-out-aap-ferg-pics-videos/">their “Runaway Tour”</a> together with two nights at The Forum in LA this week, and they just announced that they’ll do a second leg of the tour together in 2020. Once again, <b>Tyla Yaweh</b> will open.</p>
      <p>The newly-added dates include two NYC-area shows: Newark’s <b>Prudential Center on February 18</b> and Long Island’s <b>Nassau Coliseum on February 19</b>. <a href="http://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/259789/264167/4272?u=https://www.ticketmaster.com/post-malone-tickets/artist/2119390"><b>Tickets</b></a> for those shows go on sale Friday (11/22) at 9 AM with Citi and VIP presales starting today (11/19) at 5 PM and a Live Nation presale starting Thursday (11/21) at 10 AM. All dates are listed on the tour poster below.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Post Malone is set to perform his <b>Ozzy Osbourne</b> collaboration <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/behold-the-ozzy-osbourne-and-post-malone-song/">“Take What You Want”</a> with the Ozzman himself at the Ciara-hosted American Music Awards, which go down this Sunday (11/24) at LA’s Microsoft Theater and air on ABC at 8 PM Eastern. Say what you will about Post Malone, but that collaboration apparently re-energized Ozzy’s creativity and led to him making his upcoming album <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/ozzy-osbourne-announces-first-album-in-10-years-shares-under-the-graveyard/"><i>Ordinary Man</i></a> with Post Malone producer Andrew Watt.</p>
