      <p>Following <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/ozzy-osbourne-will-perform-with-post-malone-and-travis-scott-at-the-american-music-awards/">the news</a> that <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/ozzy-osbourne/">Ozzy Osbourne</a>, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/post-malone/">Post Malone</a> and Travis Scott will be teaming up for a collaborative performance at the <a href="https://www.theamas.com/">American Music Awards</a> on Sunday, November 24, it’s also been revealed that <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/green-day/">Green Day</a> will be doing something special at the event, too.</p>
      <p>The punk rock heroes, who celebrated the 25th anniversary of their third album Dookie back in February, will be honouring their legendary breakthrough record at the awards show, which takes place at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, and will air on ABC.</p>
      <p>While the AMAs tweeted the news by revealing that Green Day are “celebrating the 25th anniversary of their album, Dookie, at the #AMAs with a special performance”, <a href="https://www.theamas.com/2019/11/christina-aguilera-post-malone-and-more-to-perform-at-amas/">their website states</a> that the trio will be performing 1994 smash hit Basket Case, as well as their recent Father Of All… single. So it doesn’t sound like it’ll quite be the Dookie-in-full performance or medley we were hoping for, but the band <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/green-day-played-dookie-in-full-last-night-heres-the-set-list/">did that fairly recently anyway</a> at a gig in Spain, so this’ll still be ace.</p>

      <p>In a <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/billie-joe-armstrong-on-the-success-of-dookie-i-remember-being-pretty-freaked-out/">recent interview</a> with pop megastar Billie Eilish, Green Day frontman <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/billie-joe-armstrong/">Billie Joe Armstrong</a> reflected on the release of Dookie, and how he was perhaps too young to enjoy the band’s success at the time.</p>
      <p>“Gosh. I was only 22,” the vocalist and guitarist remembered. “I had a kid at the same time, and I was married. So it was a crazy year. I remember being pretty freaked out. I was playing a kind of music that had never been on that kind of scale before. But what I really wanted to do was keep working, and keep writing songs. I never wanted to feel like I was taking advantage of the situation. I didn’t really stop and smell the roses. Later on, I was kind of like, ‘Did I enjoy myself enough? Was that fun?’ Because the feeling of when you first get popular as a musician, that never happens twice. After that, you have to keep creating new stuff to keep things interesting in your life.”</p>
      <p>Billie Eilish asked BJA if he even enjoyed the time period, to which he responded: “Not all the time. I was sort of lost at sea. There’s extreme highs, and you’re playing to a new audience really excited to hear you. But I think what was really important to me was being real. I think I worried about that too much, the part where you’re thinking, ‘I need to stay rooted at all costs.’ Sometimes I would get very hardheaded about that. And the record after that, Insomniac, was a really dark record. I was pretty numb to everything.”</p>
