      <p>A chip shop owner accused of murdering his wife with boiling chip oil has been cleared of murder and manslaughter.</p>
      <p>Seventy-one-year-old Geoffrey Bran, who owned The Chipoteria in Carmarthenshire with his wife Mavis, told the court she had accidentally poured oil over herself during their lunchtime service tragedy.</p>
      <p>Mrs Bran, suffered fatal burns from hot frying oil at the fish and chip shop in Hermon on October 23. The 69-year-old died in Morriston Hospital six days later.</p>

        <figcaption>Mavis Bran died at Morriston Hospital, six days after being burned by the hot frying oil.</figcaption>

      <p>In the moments after Mrs Bran was burned, she told a friend and paramedic her injuries were caused by her husband throwing boiling oil over her. But, he always maintained it was an accident.</p>
      <p>Giving evidence at the trial, Bran said: "I turned around and saw her flying to the floor.</p>
      <p>"I could see the fat fryer moving forward on the table. Instantly the legs fell of the edge and the weight of the oil tipped the whole thing forwards.</p>
      <p>"The oil must have moved things fast and it was like a waterfall and landed on her chest."</p>

      <p>Swansea Crown Court heard Mavis had started drinking red wine in the morning and was over the drink-drive limit at the time of the tragic accident just before 1pm.</p>
      <p>Mavis had told a friend and a paramedic that her husband was to blame before she passed away.</p>
      <p>Friend Caroline Morgan told the jury: "She was screaming down the phone begging for help and crying.</p>
      <p>"She was screaming: 'Help me, help me, emergency, emergency! Geoff has thrown boiling oil over me. Help me, help me! Get here now - I'm burnt to hell'."</p>
      <p>A court heard Mavis also told paramedic Allison Williams that her husband had attacked her.</p>
      <p>Ms Williams said: “I asked her if she could explain what had actually happened that day.</p>
      <p>"At that point she said: "My husband threw hot fat over me.” She just stated they’d had an argument.”</p>
      <p>Swansea Crown Court heard the couple would often argue about "finances" and that Mavis would drink two bottles of wine a day.</p>
      <p>Bran admitted the couple had fallen out on the day over the cleanliness of the fryers and burnt fish.</p>

      <p>Mr and Mrs Bran, who had been married for more than 30 years, came out of retirement to start their roadside cafe called The Chipoteria in West Wales.</p>
      <p>Today after a week long trial a jury at Swansea Crown Court returned a verdict of not guilty of murder and not guilty of manslaughter.</p>
      <p>Following the verdict, Mrs Bran's family said she "lost her life in such a tragic way doing the job she loved."</p>
      <p>"She was the matriarch of the family and is missed every day.</p>
      <p>"Now that the court case is over and we finally have closure, we can rebuild our lives as a family, remembering Mavis as the fun-loving person that she was.”</p>
