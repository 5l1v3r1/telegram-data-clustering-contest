      <p>Following the conclusion of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/arrow/">Arrow</a>'s eighth and final season, a new spinoff starring Oliver Queen's daughter, titled <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/green-arrow-and-the-canaries/">Green Arrow and the Canaries</a>, will take its place. Ever since the series' announcement, fans have wondered if the spinoff would take place in the future, where Mia Smoak hails from, or in the present, following her recent travels to 2019.</p>
      <p><i>Arrow</i> co-creator and producer Marc Guggenheim has finally answered the question. On Twitter, the screenwriter answered a fan question by revealing the series will take place in the year 2040.</p>

      <p>"The #Arrow spinoff takes place in 2040," Guggenheim confirmed. "We already spoiled that Oliver is dead by that time, so his not appearing in Arrow 809 (the spinoff episode) isn't affected by what happens in Crisis (or, for that matter, the series finale)."</p>
