      <h1>Tottenham star Harry Winks heaps praise on West Ham midfielder Declan Rice</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:15:08+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://talksport.com/radioplayer/live/">Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Harry Winks has told TalkSPORT</a> (Tuesday, 10.25am) that West Ham United star Declan Rice is a “top, top player”, ahead of Saturday’s clash between the two sides.</p>
      <p>Winks, 23, starred during the international break for England – earning his fifth and sixth caps for England. He started and finished the Euro 2020 qualifying matches against Montenegro and Kosovo, even opening his account against the latter.</p>
      <p>He played alongside West Ham ace Rice in the second clash, being used as more of a box-to-box midfielder instead of a holding player. It saw Winks bamboozle the Kosovo defence with a stunning first touch, before scoring with ease.</p>
      <p>Winks was asked about Rice ahead of Saturday’s clash, and despite the rivalry between Tottenham and West Ham – he spoke highly of his England teammate even though the duo are going head to head for a place in the Euro 2020 squad.</p>

      <p><span dir="auto">“He’s a top player Dec,” <a href="https://talksport.com/radioplayer/live/">Winks said</a>. “Over the last couple of camps I’ve got to know him and he’s a top, top lad. Very nice. It’s going to be a tough game but we need to get back to winning ways. <br/></span> <span dir="auto">“What he’s done so far in such a short space of time is incredible. “To be a leader at West Ham and play for England shows just how well he has done. He is a top player and a top professional.”<br/></span></p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Which player would get in Euro 2020 squad right now?</h3>
      <p>Winks is in and out of the Tottenham side at the moment and has hardly set the world alight when given the chance to play. Rice, meanwhile, is in poor form – as his displays coincide with West Ham’s struggling performances.</p>
      <p>It must also be taken into account that they are slightly different. Rice is much more defensively-minded, given he began as a centre-back. Winks is more attacking, but breaks the play up less. He does have the knack of knitting things together.</p>
      <p>Right now, and especially after the last international break, Winks is winning the race for Euro 2020. But a lot can happen between now and then, with Rice rated at a whopping £70million (<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-could-bid-70million-20566859">Mirror</a>).</p>
