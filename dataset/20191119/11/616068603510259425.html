      <p>An ambitious new “village” is coming to the Oliver area.</p>
      <p>Greyback Construction will break ground next spring on the "District Wine Village," to be situated on Osoyoos Indian Band land just south of Gallagher Lake.</p>
      <p>The village will provide small, craft wine, beer, cider and spirit producers a chance to start their own business without having to invest in their own large-scale facility. </p>
      <p>The project will include 16 individual spaces that will give producers the chance to create their own brand with “a low capital investment and operational assistance along the way.”</p>
      <p>Each space will provide a fully-equipped production facility, built-in tasting room and access to a shared crush pad and operational resources.</p>
      <p>The project will also include a 600-person entertainment centre for concerts and events, as well as on-site “culinary offerings.”</p>
      <p>“Ultimately, this project is all about community,” said Greyback Construction general manager Matt Kenyon. “Not only are we creating a diverse community for our resident wineries, cideries, breweries, distilleries and eateries, but we are really looking to be a significant economic driver for our local communities and support the future growth of wine and culinary tourism in the South Okanagan.”</p>
      <p>The project, which will aim to be the "gateway to Canada's Wine capital," is being entirely funded and constructed by Greyback Construction, which has taken out a long-term lease with the Osoyoos Indian Band for the development.</p>
