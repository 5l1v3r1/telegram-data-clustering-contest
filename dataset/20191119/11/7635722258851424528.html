        <b>Scrum-half Kieran Marmion will remain on these shores after penning a new three-year contract extension with Irish province Connacht until 2023. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The 27-year-old was left out of the Irish Rugby World Cup squad, prompting speculation he may have sought pastures new.</p>
      <p>However, he has agreed to remain on with the Western outfit until the end of the 2022/23 season.</p>
      <p>Kieran Marmion has played over 160 games for Connacht. He joined the Connacht Academy in 2011. He has been capped 27 times for Ireland since making his debut against Argentina in 2014.</p>
      <p>He will now look to impress new Ireland head coach Andy Farrell.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Connacht Head Coach Andy Friend said: </b>
      </p>
      <p>“Kieran has been an outstanding player for Connacht and for Ireland. He is a diligent professional and through his hard work, he has progressed through the Connacht Academy and on to play for Ireland. His progress demonstrates the support that is available to players through our academy pathway.  Kieran’s commitment to Connacht for a further three seasons demonstrates his ambition to contribute at provincial and international level in the coming years. His signing also ensures that we continue to retain a squad equipped to compete at the highest level of European club rugby."</p>
