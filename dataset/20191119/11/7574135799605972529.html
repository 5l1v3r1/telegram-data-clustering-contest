      <p><b>Soccer Mommy</b>, the project of Nashville native Sophie Allison, <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/soccer-mommy-releases-new-single-lucy-on-loma-vista/">signed to Loma Vista</a> to release a new single, “lucy,” back in September, and now she’s shared another new song, “yellow is the color of her eyes,” which is accompanied by a seven-minute short film directed by Alex Ross Perry (<i>Her Smell</i>). “‘yellow is the color of her eyes’ is a song that is really important to me,” Sophie says. “The song was inspired by a time when I was on the road constantly and I felt like I was losing time – specifically with my mother. It’s also a song that I feel really showcases my writing when it comes to instrumentation, so it’s one that makes me really proud.” Watch the video below.</p>
      <p>Soccer Mommy is opening for <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/the-jesus-lizard-playing-new-years-eve-in-nyc-other-tour-dates/">The Jesus Lizard</a> in Nashville at the end of the year, and for 2020 she’s heading on an international headlining tour, starting March 26 in Atlanta, GA. She’ll hit Washington DC, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Chicago, Salt Lake City, Portland, Seattle, Austin and more in March and April, with well-matched support from <b>Tomberlin</b> and <b>Emily Reo</b> on various dates.</p>
