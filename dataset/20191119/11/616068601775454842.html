      <p>The South Okanagan Regional RCMP is sharing a little “good news” from an incident earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Const. Matthew Groen of the Keremeos RCMP was called by residents on Nov. 7 at 6 p.m. to the side of Highway 3A, north of Olalla.</p>
      <p>Const. Groen arrived to find a young moose caught in a barbed-wire fence. Bystanders said they believed the young moose’s mother was nearby and would not leave without the calf. </p>
      <p>The officer fetched a set of bolt cutters from the Keremeos detachment and returned to cut the wire and free the moose, which was seen running back into the brush.</p>
      <p>“These are the kinds of good news stories the public rarely hears about. Officers working in remote detachments often have to use their ingenuity to problem solve unique situations on their own,” said Const. James Grandy in a news release.</p>
