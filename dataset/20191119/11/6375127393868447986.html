      <h3>First of all, happy birthday to Atty. Renato dela Cruz. A consistent top honor student during his schooldays  —from elementary all the way to college- Atty. Dela Cruz was also the former city legal officer of Manila, no less.</h3>
      <p>May you always stay blessed and have many, many more birthdays to come!!</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>The Department of Agriculture (DA) deserves a pat in the back for quietly but  swiftly acting on two important issues that directly fall under its jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>Funds allocated for the agri-fishery sector has reached a total of P73.5 billion, on top of the DA’s 2019 budget of P64.1 billion.</p>
      <p>The funds, which by the way came into being just 100 days since Agriculture Secretary William Dar assumed office on August 5, 2019, were allocated in quick response to the two of the biggest, emerging issues that Dar had to face upon his assumption to office, namely the Rice Tariffication Law (RTL) and the African Swine Fever (ASF).</p>
      <p>The full P10 billion funding for this year’s implementation of the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Program (RCEP) has been allocated as financial aid to make farmers more competitive and to counter the negative impact of the RTL.</p>
      <p>The government meantime, has also allotted a total of P3 billion for the unconditional cash transfer program benefitting 600,000 rice farmers.</p>
      <p>About P2.5 billion was allotted for the Expanded Survival and Recovery Assistance Program for Rice Farmers (SURE Aid Program) who are tilling one-hectare or less of farm land.</p>
      <p>Another P7 billion has been allotted to the National Food Authority (NFA) to procure directly from the farmers, in line with the government’s food security program.</p>
      <p>Out of this P7-billion budget, it was learned that the NFA has already procured 71 percent of the target, which is equivalent to 10.25 million bags of palay from January to second week of November of this year.</p>
      <p>In partnership with the local governments, 30 provinces have committed to procure, process, and market palay (unmilled rice), directly from farmers bringing the amount to P5B to help prop up farmgate price.</p>
      <p>Dar has pointed out that the amount is ‘on top of the P3.5 billion credit line the local governments of Isabela, Nueva Ecija, and Camarines Sur opened to provide loan for rice farmers in their localities.’</p>
      <p>On the other hand meanwhile, the DA has also allocated P375 million as for the indemnification program to assist hog raisers whose farms were affected by the ASF.</p>
      <p>This amount is on top of the P100 million committed by the Pork Producers Federation of the Philippines, SamahangIndustriya ng Agrikultura (SINAG), and National Federation of Hog Raisers Incorporated and P1 billion from President Rodrigo Duterte’s contingency fund.</p>
      <p>Along this line, the World Bank has also committed a whopping $500 million (or P26 billion) as assistance for the development of the local agriculture sector in order to cover more areas and projects in the country.</p>
      <p>The proposed projects include the $200 million provincial agricultural and fishery extension delivery system, $200 million coastal resilience and fisheries development project and $100 million Mindanao inclusive agriculture development project.</p>
      <p>The proposed projects are on top of the extension of the current World Bank-funded Philippine Rural Development Project (PRDP) worth $280 million (or P15 billion), Dar had said.</p>
