      <h1>Camel, cow and donkey found wandering in Kansas neighborhood</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:45:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:45</time> by <a rel="author">Mary Jo DiLonardo</a></address>
      <p>No doubt authorities in Goddard, Kansas, thought someone was about to tell a pretty corny joke. When they got a call about a camel, cow and donkey hanging out together in a neighborhood, there had to be a punchline. Were they about to walk into a bar?</p>
      <p>But the meandering animals were real.</p>
      <p>"Does anyone know the owners of these three friends traveling together (towards a Northern star) just East of Goddard?" the police department <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GoddardPoliceDepartment/photos/a.1532067436832650/2659808440725205/?type=3&amp;theater">posted on Facebook</a>. "If we can not locate the owner, we may be halfway towards a live nativity this Christmas season."</p>
      <p>The unusual trio sparked quite a few comments, especially this close to the holidays.</p>
      <p>"Are there 3 wise looking men near?"</p>
      <p>"Let them keep walking and follow them. Who knows, they may lead you to the second coming. ITS A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE."</p>
      <p>"If all humans could just get along like most animals do."</p>
      <p>The people who actually saw the animals up close were especially amazed.</p>
      <p>Trudy Wilcox said she was driving into the neighborhood when she saw the unlikely companions.</p>
      <p>“We were just coming back from picking up a friend and came into the trailer park and the first thing we see is, hey there's a cow, wait a minute, that’s a donkey, and that’s a camel and we had all three,” she told <a href="https://www.kwch.com/content/news/A-camel-cow-and-donkey-caught-running-away-from-Goddard-home--565076852.html">KWCH-TV</a>. “The camel was trying to find tall branches so he could have some leaves."</p>
      <p>After neighbors called 911, police arrived and posted the photo on Facebook. They were able to reunite the runaways with their owner, who lived just a few blocks away and is an employee of a local wildlife park.</p>
      <p>While the animals waited for their family to arrive, they enjoyed lots of attention, getting petted and posing for photos.</p>
      <p>And because some neighbors already had Christmas decorations up, the animals brought some extra holiday spirit.</p>
      <p>“We thought it was only missing the sheep because you had the cow, a camel and a donkey all in the nativity,” said Kevin Wilcox. “I just thought that was kind of a cool thing this close to Christmas.”</p>
