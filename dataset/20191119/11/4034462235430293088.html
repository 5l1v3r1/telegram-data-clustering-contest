      <h1>Chevrolet Has A Corvette Stingray Problem You Can Help Solve</h1>
      <h2>Good news for C7 fans.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:36:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:36</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Wright</a></address>
      <p>For those not convinced about the new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/corvette">C8 Corvette</a>, we have good news. There's a couple of reasons to hold off, maybe even a couple of years, on investing in the new Corvette platform. It's a whole new approach to building a Corvette, and, like any new model, there will likely be issues to be ironed out. Then there's going to be dealers increasing their profit margin for a new and very much in demand car. Some Corvette fans simply don't want a mid-engined Corvette, so the last 5,025 available from dealers lots will be the last chance to <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/corvette-grand-sport-coupe">pick up a new C7 model brand new</a>.</p>

      <p>The information comes via <a href="https://www.corvetteblogger.com/2019/11/18/national-corvette-inventory-drops-to-5025-cars-with-a-122-day-supply/">Corvette Blogger</a> and from a website called eInventoryNow.com that aids dealerships in managing their automotive inventories. The most recent update as of writing shows that the nationwide inventory for C7 Corvettes is at 5,025 units. That adds up to a 122-day supply at the rate they are selling right now and means supply will run out just as the delayed C8 Corvette finally becomes available. The last C7 Corvette, a Z06, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/final-chevrolet-corvette-c7-rolls-off-the-production-line">has already rolled off of the production line</a> and is headed to a charity auction, so this really is it once the stragglers get to the dealers.</p>

      <p>The chances are that C7 Corvette shoppers can get a decent discount for now as the majority are waiting for the new model. How good of a deal we'll have to keep an eye out for as it is an end-of-an-era car. Currently, Chevy is offering a $3,000 Loyalty Bonus, so it will depend on the take-rate and how urgent getting rid of them becomes as to whether that offer gets better or disappears entirely. There's no breakdown of what models are currently available, so anyone wanting a specific trim and color is going to have to do some detective work and possibly have to travel to pick it up.</p>
