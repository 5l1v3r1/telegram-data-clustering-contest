      <p>In the spirit of Hollywood smiles being all perfect veneers and bright, white, blinding grins, Kirsten Dunst has revealed Spider-Man bosses once tried to cover up her famous snaggletooth.</p>
      <p>Kirsten’s grin was endearing and basically the smile led us into the 00s, strong in the conviction Hollywood was going to be alright.</p>
      <p>Be that as it may, as she starred as Mary-Jane Watson in 2002’s Spider-Man (before going on to reprise her role in 2004 and 2007), Kirsten has revealed bosses tried to alter her perfectly imperfect smile.</p>
      <p>‘…on Spider-Man one of the producers tried to subtly coerce me into changing my teeth into those perfect Barbie doll teeth,’ <a href="https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/kirsten-dunst-on-new-sbs-show-the-power-of-saying-no-and-why-shes-never-had-her-moment/news-story/52fcd789e848d978baac05f331ec6030">Kirsten told News.com.au</a>.</p>
      <p>‘I was like, “Nope, not doing that either”.’</p>

      <p>She’d recalled the anecdote while talking about a stunt she wasn’t keen to do, and her steadfast objection to doing it despite pushes from bosses.</p>

      <p>At the age of 20 she was evidently already quite comfortable with sticking up for herself in an industry where other 20-something actress may have felt they were unable.</p>

      <p>Speaking about the way in which she was brought up, she cited the strong females who inspired her, as well as landing in the industry and working with the likes of Sofia Coppola as a teenager.</p>
      <p>‘You know what, when I was younger I had really strong females around me – my mother, working with Sofia Coppola at 16 when I was really becoming a woman,’ she continued.</p>
      <p>‘I had very good influences personally of women who were like, “You’re great, love your teeth, don’t change a thing”.</p>
      <p>‘I was given a strong sense of what I feel comfortable with. And, ultimately, it’s a TV show or a movie, so I’m not going to kill myself and get in an accident.</p>
      <p>‘If my intuition’s telling me “No, no, no”, then I’m not going to do it…’</p>
