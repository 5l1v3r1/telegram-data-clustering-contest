      <p>Following disappointing earnings <b>Cisco </b>(NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/csco-stock-quote/"><b><u>CSCO</u></b></a>) has left many feeling the tech giant has boxed itself into a hole. But are today’s worries something CSCO stock can climb out of? Let’s take a look at what’s happening off and on the price chart, as well as where and when investors might consider buying shares.</p>

      <p>This past week Cisco stock affirmed an important and undesirable business pivot. Citing macroeconomic headwinds, CEO Chuck Robbins guided the blue-chip company’s second-quarter revenues to a 3%-5% year-over-year decline compared to Wall Street forecasts of 2.6% growth.</p>
      <p>The downward sales revision looks to disrupt more than two years of rising sales. Moreover, as one of the market’s better gauges of global tech spending, the news could be a shot over the bow to companies as far ranging as <b>Apple</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/aapl-stock-quote/"><b><u>AAPL</u></b></a>) and <b>Amazon</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/amzn-stock-quote/"><b><u>AMZN</u></b></a>). And investors sent a damning message right back at the CSCO stock price as shares tanked nearly 7.5% in the report’s immediate aftermath last Thursday.</p>
      <h3>Earnings by the Numbers</h3>
      <p>Still, the report was far from being uniformly bad. Cisco stock did narrowly top analyst profit and sales views for its first quarter. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/cisco-csco-earnings-q1-2020.html">By the numbers</a> Cisco delivered profits of 84 cents per share which beat estimates by 3 cents. Revenues of $13.2 billion came in slightly above a forecast $13.1 billion for the period. Also, inroads away from the company’s traditional networking business model and into more promising growth markets continue to be made.</p>
      <p>Cisco’s security business delivered sales of $815 million for the quarter versus estimates of $723 million. That’s promising. And the company’s applications segment including AppDynamics saw revenues of $1.5 billion which squeaked past views of $1.48 billion.</p>
      <p>Additionally, while Cisco’s warning appears to have obvious challenges for its largest businesses, the environment should promote cost-cutting advantages. As well, today’s hardships should result in the tech giant pivoting further into more lucrative software and recurring revenue markets for longer-term benefit.</p>
      <h3>Cisco Stock Price Weekly Chart</h3>

      <p>On the weekly chart CSCO stock’s post-earnings reaction has undone a constructive double-bottom pattern that has formed over the past three months. The selling pressure also cut beneath trend-line support tied to Cisco’s December 2018 low.</p>
      <p>The technical failures aren’t a good sign for CSCO’s near-term direction. The good news is longer-term investors can take solace that shares remain inside a solid support zone. Highlighted in blue, this area is backed by former price congestion, key Fibonacci levels dating as far back as the dot-com era and trend-line support tethered to Cisco’s 2016 bottom.</p>
      <h3>How to Trade CSCO Stock</h3>
      <p>Looking ahead, my guess is CSCO stock will find a meaningful low within this defined support area. Now though, a challenge of $39-$40 and the bottom of the price zone looks increasingly likely as short-term fears trump Cisco’s longer-term financial wherewithal. Having said that, there’s no rush to buy CSCO today.</p>
      <p>I’d recommend investors wait on price confirmation from a fully developed weekly reversal pattern. Hopefully a buying opportunity forms closer to $40 than current levels near $45 in CSCO stock. And failing that type of value-add in shareholder value? Cisco stock is still within 13% of the zone’s bottom. Cisco also offers a fairly generous yield in excess of 3%. As much, a future purchase of CSCO inside the support zone and in conjunction with a stop-loss beneath $38.60 still holds attractive qualities off and on the price chart.</p>
