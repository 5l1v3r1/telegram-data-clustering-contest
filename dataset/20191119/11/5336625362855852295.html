      <p><b>TL;DR:</b> The Xbox One S <i>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</i> bundle is available for <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdws">£249.99 on Amazon</a>.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Bundle deals are great because you get a console and game in one convenient package. At least, that's how it normally works.</p>
      <p>There's one bundle deal in the Amazon "Countdown to Black Friday Sale" that is bucking the trend by offering a whole lot more in the same package. Seriously, the Xbox One S <i>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</i> bundle is absolutely stacked.</p>
      <p>This impressive bundle includes the Xbox One S (1TB) console, an Xbox wireless controller, a deluxe edition full-game download of <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdws"><i>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</i></a>, one-month of Xbox Live Gold, a one-month trial of Xbox Game Pass, and one-month of EA Access. That is a lot.</p>
      <p>This bundle is available for just <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdws">£249.99 on Amazon</a>, which is really great value when you consider how much is included. We can't see this dropping in the coming weeks, particularly as the game has only just been released.</p>
      <p>You will struggle to find a better value bundle deal in the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales.</p>
