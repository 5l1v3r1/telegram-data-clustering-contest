      <h1>How to apply for Great British Bake Off 2020 - the 24 rules and 38 questions they ask everyone who applies</h1>
      <h2>Even the application form is really, really tough</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tristan Cork</a></address>
      <p>Dust off your oven gloves, rinse out your mixing bowls and cover everything in flour - for applications have already opened for next year’s Great British Bake Off.</p>
      <p>Programme makers have begun the search for next year’s star bakers, to follow in the footsteps of Priya, Steph and from 2018, Bristol’s very own <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bake-off-gbbo-briony-2018-1947005">Briony Williams</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s actually a Bristol-based production company organising the search, and there are around 45 days for people to get their applications in to join Paul Hollywood, Prue Leith, Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig in the Bake Off tent next summer.</p>
      <p>And there is a website to visit and an application form to fill in, but beware - for the process to find next year’s <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/gbbo-final-bake-off-briony-1920266">Bake Off contestants</a> is a rigorous one, and it might even take you weeks to even fill in the form properly.</p>
      <p>So here is everything you need to know to follow in the footsteps of Briony and get to the signature challenge.</p>
      <h3>The rules</h3>
      <p>The makers of Bake Off are Love Productions, and they have no fewer than 24 different rules you have to meet, pass or agree to before you can proceed to the actual application itself.</p>
      <p>Most of the rules are technical ones around agreeing to appearing on a television programme - that you agree to keep it secret, do what they tell you, tell them everything about yourself and that sort of thing.</p>

      <p>As long as you’re ok with signing over your life to Bake Off for a few months, and haven’t got any skeletons in the cupboard that you’re not prepared to tell them about, the rules mainly concern who is eligible to enter in the first place:</p>
      <p>To enter GBBO you have to be</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Over 16 from January 1, 2020</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Resident of the UK</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>NOT have an NVQ or any other qualification in baking, cooking, food production, food preparation or catering, unless it was more than ten years ago.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>You cannot have EVER worked full-time as a baker, cook or chef.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be amateur - “meaning your main source of income must not derive from commercial baking or cooking in a professional environment”.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bake Off even define clearly what they mean by ‘professional environment’ (restaurant, hotel, canteen, bakery, shop etc) and even what they mean by ‘baking’: “The term ‘baking’ refers to the preparation and oven cooking of flour- (or flour equivalent) based goods such as bread, cakes, pastries, pies, tarts, and biscuits. It does not refer to other food forms that can be oven cooked, or other methods of cooking.”</p>
      <p>Other rules state that you have to be able to commit to filming days between April and July 2020. They don’t say when they are, but it’s usually every weekend in the Bake Off tent. And also, you have to be able to commit to be available for the spin-off show - entitled ‘An Extra Slice’, when the programme eventually airs next autumn.</p>
      <h3>The application itself</h3>
      <p>Once you’ve agreed to the long set of rules, and confirmed you are eligible to actually apply to start with, then you have to fill in the application form itself.</p>
      <p>And that is no tick box exercise.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>There are no fewer than 28 questions about what you are like as a baker, what you bake, what you can’t bake, what your filo pastry is like, how often you make desserts - you name it, they ask it.</p>
      <p>In fact, so demanding and detailed is the application process, that the programme-makers allow people to save their application form, go off and bake a few cakes, and come back - for yes, they want pictures. Five of them, of different bakes, cakes, puddings, pies, you name it.</p>
      <p>“We're looking for people with a real passion for baking,” said a spokesperson.</p>
      <p>“Don't worry if you're not a great writer, just tell us as much as you can about you and your baking.</p>

      <p>“We want to hear what you’re good at, but also what you're not so good at. We're not expecting you to be brilliant at everything; this just helps us to get a clearer idea of what kind of baker you are.</p>
      <p>“We want to see your baking! Please include a range of photos of different bakes to show off your baking repertoire,” she added.</p>
      <h3>And then it gets personal</h3>
      <p>It’s not enough to just confirm you’re over 16, live in Britain and are eligible to enter, GBBO wants to know all about who you are too.</p>
      <p>Some commentators in the media have questioned whether Bake Off makes an effort to be diverse when choosing its contestants.</p>
      <p>In fact, the Telegraph reported an answer judge Prue Leith gave last year at a literary festival, when someone raised that very issue.</p>
      <p>The Telegraph said Leith ‘maintained that the show does not deliberately seek to demonstrate diversity’.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>“The main criteria for getting onto Bake Off is nothing to do with all that political correctness, it's how good a baker you are.</p>
      <p>"They don't even think of gender, or sexual orientation, or nationality, or colour of skin or anything until they get right to the end.</p>
      <p>"There are thousands and thousands of people, by the time it gets down to 200 you are bound to have a mix of British society. And you will have equally good bakers. So then they start worrying about how good they are on television, and all that.</p>
      <p>"It's a baking show, it's not about gender politics or anything,” she added.</p>
      <p>After all the questions about baking prowess and experience, there are questions and forms on the application about exactly who you are as a person too.</p>
      <p>As well as at least five photographs of your own baking creations, they want a photo of you too.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And here is the list of questions about yourself that they would like to know - it’s fairly comprehensive.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is your current living situation? E.g. single, cohabiting, married, living with parents/friends/children etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you have any children/grandchildren? If so, how old are they?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you have any hobbies other than baking? Please give details.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Tell us about your occupation. Do you enjoy your working life?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Describe a typical day for you.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Finish this sentence. I would describe myself as...</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Have you ever applied to or been on a TV or radio show? Please give details of programme, dates and how far you went in the selection process.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And then comes the agreement to letting the production company keep your details, and also a criminal records check.</p>
      <p>So, to recap, the deadline for applications is Sunday, January 5, 2020. You can apply online - at www.applyforbakeoff.co.uk - or get in touch for more information on the number 07544 991683 or tweet @BritishBakeOff or visit the Facebook page @greatbritishbakeoff.</p>
      <p>So, if you think you’ve got what it takes to get a congratulatory handshake for your doughnuts from Paul Hollywood, and you think you’ve got what it takes to even fill in this form, <a href="http://www.applyforbakeoff.co.uk/">then click here</a> , and good luck. You have until January 5, and you'll probably need it.</p>
