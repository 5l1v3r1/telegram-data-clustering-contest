      <p>A new Costa Coffee store will open soon in a Derby suburb.</p>
      <p>The chain has announced a new branch will open early next year at Park Farm Shopping Centre, in Allestree.</p>
      <p>The branch will be located in the former Royal Bank of Scotland building which <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/new-costa-coffee-planned-derby-3426766">closed around a year ago</a> and has remained vacant since.</p>
      <p>A Costa Coffee spokeswoman said: “We’re delighted to confirm the opening of a brand new Costa Coffee store at Park Farm Shopping Centre in Allestree, Derby - coming early next year.</p>
      <p>"We are looking forward to being an active part of the local community, getting involved with events and serving customers our delicious signature, handcrafted coffees.”</p>
