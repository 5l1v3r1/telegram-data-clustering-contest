      <h1>Cats: James Corden, Taylor Swift Join the Felines in Purr-fect New Trailer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:11:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Arvedon</a></address>
      <p>The newest trailer for Universal Pictures' <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/cats/">Cats</a></i> has arrived, doubling down on the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/cats-trailer-motion-capture-uncanny-valley/">uncanny valley</a> of the footage that originally <a href="https://www.cbr.com/cat-official-trailer/">debuted in July</a>.</p>
      <p><i>Cats</i> is an adaptation of T. S. Eliot’s <i>Old Possum's Book of Practical Cat</i>, a book of philosophical musings on the nature of cats. The story centers on a group of cats called the Jellicles. Every year, this tribe is forced to make the Jellicle Choice, deciding which cat will enter the Heaviside Layer and be reborn.</p>

      <p>"I loved the reaction," <a href="https://www.cbr.com/rebel-wilson-cats-trailer-creepy/">Rebel Wilson said</a> after the film's first trailer received criticism for how it blended humans and cats through CGI. "I think it was a bit polarizing and people will be super-curious to see the finished product. What you got in that trailer was just some small samples of it, but it’s going to be such a big movie. And the cast is obviously incredible."</p>
      <p>Directed by Tom Hooper, <i>Cats</i> stars James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swift, Rebel Wilson and Francesca Hayward. The film opens Dec. 20.</p>
