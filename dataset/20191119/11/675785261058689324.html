      <h2>The bar says women are never made to prove their weight, which is used to determine the amount of free drinks they can have</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:19:43+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:19</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>A bar has divided opinion with its promotion to give women free drinks based on their weight - but says the offer has been so successful it's been extended.</p>
      <p>Fusion Club, based at the four-star Cassells Al Barsha Hotel in Dubai, has attracted attention due to its happy hour deal designed to show that 'it's good to gain weight'.</p>
      <p>Women are given the choice between weighing themselves on a scale near the entrance of the bar, or writing their weight on a slip of paper and handing it to the barman.</p>
      <p>For every kilogram a guest weighs, the bar matches it with one free United Arab Emirates dirham to spend on drinks.</p>

      <p>For example, if a woman weighed 60kg, she would get free drinks worth 60 AED - which is equal to around £12.50, as reported by the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/a-dubai-bar-is-giving-women-free-drinks-based-on-their-weight-11175287/">Metro</a> .</p>
      <p>The deal applies for all drinks and the bar's vice president says they 'don't see any reason to feel having bad intention about the offer' because women are never asked to prove their weight but instead trusted by the number they write down.</p>
      <p>"We believe in being different than the rest of the night clubs and hotels in making our guests delighted.</p>

      <p>"We wanted the ladies to surprise their partners and friends that it’s good to gain weight.</p>
      <p>"We have different promotions at Fusion Club every month, which are often 'crazy' and unique and are enjoyed by both men and women."</p>
      <p>The bar says the promotion has been met with such a positive reaction that the offer which was due to end in August will now run until December.</p>
      <p>However, with the motto 'it's good to gain weight' used on the advertising posters, others have claimed the deal can act to promote obesity.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "This is just stupid, and FYI it promotes fat gain and obesity… like the fatter you are the more we’ll allow you to consume empty calories which, in turn, will make you… even fatter?"</p>
