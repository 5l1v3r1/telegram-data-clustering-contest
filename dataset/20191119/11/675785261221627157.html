      <h1>Gareth Bale reacts to Wales fans' song trolling Real Madrid</h1>
      <h2>Gareth Bale is the subject of a new chant that makes fun of his love for golf over Real Madrid but he has taken it well ahead of Wales' game with Hungary</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:14:12+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:14</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Meade</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Bale has approved of the new song chanted by Welsh fans which pokes fun at his love for golf.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> star was in action against Azerbaijan on Saturday and was the subject of a new tune from the visiting fans.</p>
      <p>Bale has often been criticised for his dedication to the national team and love of the golf course.</p>
      <p>And rather than singing the usual "Viva Gareth Bale" Welsh fans have changed the lyrics to "Wales, golf, Madrid" to reflect his lifestyle.</p>
      <p>Former Real Madrid star Pedja Mijatovic recently hit out at Bale for his priorities by saying: "The first thing he thinks about is Wales, then golf and after that, Real Madrid."</p>

      <p>But Bale has made light of the situation insisting he's happy as long as the Welsh fans are getting behind the team.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’ve heard it, especially when I was on the bench when I came off and the boys were laughing. It’s a bit of fun.</p>
      <p>“We want the Welsh fans to be the same as always - to be supporting us, to sing, to be the 12th man."</p>
      <p>A banner featuring the newly remixed lyrics will be on show at the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff</a> City Stadium when Wales host Hungary tonight.</p>

      <p>Los Blancos goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois hit out at Bale last season calling him "the golfer" and several of his team-mates don't believe he is interested in immersing himself within the group.</p>
      <p>Bale has not featured for the Spanish side since he picked up an injury during the last round of internationals, but did manage 60 minutes during the away day win at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old has a difficult relationship with Zinedine Zidane at the Bernabeu and was close to quitting the Spanish giants for a lucrative move to China.</p>
      <p>A deal with Shanghai Shenhua broke down late on, but they are reportedly considering another bid as are <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>Zidane has insisted that Bale will remain in Madrid until the season ends, but the forward does not enjoy the affection of his manager or the club's fans.</p>
