        <b>Nexperia has announced its entry into the GaN FET market with the introduction of the 650V GAN063-650WSA, with a gate-source voltage (VGS) of +/-20V and a temperature range of -55 to 175°C. The GAN063-650WSA features a low RDS(on) – down to 60 mΩ – and fast switching for efficiency.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The company is targeting applications including xEV, datacentres, telecom infrastructure, industrial automation and high-end power supplies. Nexperia says its GaN-on-silicon process is highly scalable as wafers can be processed in existing silicon fabrication facilities.</p>

      <p>Moreover, the device is available in industry-standard TO-247, allowing customers to benefit from GaN performance in a familiar package.</p>
      <p>Toni Versluijs, general manager of Nexperia MOS Business Group says “This is a strategic move for Nexperia into the high voltage area, and we can now deliver technology suitable for xEV power semiconductor applications.”</p>
      <p>The automotive sector is a key area of focus for the company, owing to the potential for significant growth over the coming decades.</p>
      <p>The GAN063-650WSA GaN FET is the first in a portfolio of GaN devices the company is developing to address the automotive, communication infrastructure and industrial markets.</p>
