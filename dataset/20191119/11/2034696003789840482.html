        <b>The phrase has gone viral among millennials recently</b>
      </p>
      <p>US TV network Fox has filed a trademark application for the viral phrase ‘OK Boomer’.</p>
      <p>The phrase, used by millennials, pokes fun at the baby boomer generation, suggesting they’re out of touch.</p>
      <p>‘OK Boomer’ first appeared on TikTok, but has since become a viral meme across a host of social networks, and merchandise has been created with the phrase emblazoned on it.</p>
      <p>Now, as pointed out by trademark lawyer Josh Gerben, Fox filed the trademark application on November 11, with the intention of “launch[ing] a reality, comedy and/or game show called OK BOOMER.”</p>

      <p>According to <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn88687936&amp;docId=RFA20191114082601#docIndex=0&amp;page=1">the filing</a>, Fox wants to use the phrase ‘OK Boomer’ in “entertainment services, namely, an on-going television series featuring reality competition, comedy, and game shows.”</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/entertainment/ok-boomer-fox-trademark-trnd/index.html">CNN</a> about the likelihood of the trademark being passed, Gerben says: “In all likelihood, the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) will deny all of these applications because OK BOOMER has become a ‘widely used message’.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “A trademark registration will not issue in a phrase that is commonly used to convey a social or political message. This is because such a ‘viral’ phrase is incapable of identifying the source of a product or service — which is what trademarks must do to be capable of registration.”</p>
