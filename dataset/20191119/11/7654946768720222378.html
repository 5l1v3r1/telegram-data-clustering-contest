      <h1>Brooklyn pol wants new agency to help nonprofits with city’s flawed contract system</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:10:23+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:10</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Calder</a></address>
      <p>A Brooklyn lawmaker is pushing legislation to create a new city office that would help nonprofits better navigate the red tape plaguing the city’s broken contracting system.</p>
      <p>The bill, introduced by Councilwoman Farah Louis (D-Brooklyn), would require Mayor Bill de Blasio to create an Office of Not-For-Profit Services that would include its own director, budget and staff.</p>
      <p>The new agency would serve as a liaison between City Hall and nonprofits on contracting and funding problems, government policies and other matters.</p>
      <p>Louis’ proposal comes following a series of scathing Post reports illustrating how city agencies are routinely tardy in paying nonprofits that provide services to the needy.</p>
      <p>“This would be a first-of-its-kind office that would give our nonprofits a safe space and [city] staff to go-to for any help they need,” Louis told the Post Monday. “We need a director and a team that can assist all nonprofits that are serving people on the ground.”</p>
      <p>Councilman Justin Brannan (D-Brooklyn), who is co-sponsoring the bill, added the new agency would “cut down on red tape and establish a central office to provide our city’s nonprofits with the crucial assistance and support they need.”</p>
      <p>“We need to do everything we can to support these critical organizations, so they can focus on the important services they provide to New Yorkers – not endless, paralyzing paperwork,” he added.</p>
      <p>Specifics of the plan, such as staff size and budget, have yet to be ironed out.</p>
      <p>Louis’ proposal is among a package of four bills aimed at assisting nonprofits that will be the focus of a City Council finance committee hearing on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Among them is also a bill by Councilman Antonio Reynoso (D-Brooklyn) to create the job of ombudsperson in the city’s Finance Department, who would assist nonprofits that own property. The bill would also exempt certain types of lien sales of properties owned by nonprofits.</p>
      <p>The Post first exposed the city’s epidemic of late payments in a May 2018 story that revealed that the Department of Homeless Services <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/05/28/de-blasio-administration-chronically-late-paying-for-homeless-services/">was late processing and paying contracts</a> nearly 80 percent of the time.</p>
      <p>Other city agencies were late 59 percent of the time.</p>
      <p>Changes were slow in coming. The charities <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/01/28/de-blasio-administration-is-still-paying-late-for-services-charities/">told The Post</a> in a January follow-up that things had not improved — <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/01/31/city-still-super-slow-paying-contracts-despite-de-blasio-vow/">despite promises from de Blasio</a> that the problems would be fixed.</p>
      <p>However, a follow-up Post examination in August found that the city’s Department of Homeless Services <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/07/city-hall-finally-tackles-late-payment-epidemic-that-slowed-homeless-fight/">was processing contracts more promptly.</a></p>
      <p>Jose Bayona, a de Blasio spokesman, said “this administration appreciates the acknowledgment of what we have accomplished thus far in partnership with nonprofit leaders and looks forward to exploring how to maintain this engagement into the future.”</p>
      <p>“We are looking forward to working with the Council on this package of legislation.”</p>
