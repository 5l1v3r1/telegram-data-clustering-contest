      <p>Jacob Kane will finally have to answer to his long-lost daughter in an upcoming episode of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/batwoman-tv/"><i>Batwoman</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The CW has released a promo for the series' eighth episode, ominously titled "The Mad Tea-Party," with Jacob face-to-face with his daughter Beth, who has since taken on the villainous mantle of Alice after being presumed dead for the past 11 years. With Jacob held captive in an abandoned theater, it's clear this family reunion won't exactly be a heartwarming one.</p>

      <p>"For the past 11 years, I've dreamt of revenge," Alice hisses as Batwoman confronts her sister to discover her father's whereabouts.</p>
      <p>After Beth was involved in a car accident that separated her from her family, Jacob presumed her dead, estranging his relationship with Kate. However, Beth was secretly raised by terrorists to become the <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>-themed villain, returning to wreak havoc on <a href="https://screenrant.com/batwoman-lucius-fox-dead-arrowverse/">Gotham City</a>.</p>
