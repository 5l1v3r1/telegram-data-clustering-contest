      <p>Councils across England profited a combined £930 million in parking operations for the 2018/19 financial year, new data has revealed.</p>
      <p>A report to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, and analysed by the RAC Foundation, uncovered this figure — which is a seven per cent increase on 2017/18’s £867 million.</p>
      <p>Combined, the 353 local authorities made a gross income of £1.746 billion from parking for the 2018/19 financial year — £454 million of which came from penalties, and £558 million from permits.</p>
      <p>The amount spent on running council-controlled parking operations was said to be £816 million for the last financial year — a three per cent increase on 2017/18. This figure does not take into account interest payments or depreciation of capital assets, however.</p>
      <p>Of all the 353 councils that returned figures to central government, just 41 are said to have reported a loss on parking operations.</p>
      <p>Steve Gooding, RAC Foundation director, said: “Every year the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government produces their tally of English councils’ income from, and expenditure on, parking.</p>
      <p>“Penalties now seem to account for nearly half of all on-street parking income. What will surprise drivers is that even as parking income soars, the amount of money being spent on routine road maintenance by councils has been in reverse.”</p>
