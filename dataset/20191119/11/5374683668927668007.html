      <h1>Satmar Rebbe arrives in Israel</h1>
      <h2>One of the two spiritual leaders of the Satmar Hasidic movement will participate in fundraiser for organizations that refuse state funding.</h2>

      <p>One of the two Rebbes of the Satmar movement, Rabbi Yekutiel Yehuda Teitelbaum - better known as Rabbi Zalman Leib - landed this morning (Tuesday) in Israel, flying on a private plane from Heathrow airport, in London. Haredi leaders met the rebbe at Ben Gurion Airport.</p>
      <p>Teitelbaum is expected to take part in many different events in Jerusalem, including donating some five million dollars to organizations who do not accept funds from the state.</p>
      <p>Member of Knesset Yulia Malinovsky (Yisrael Beytenu) took to Twitter to attack the fact that roads are being closed for Teitelbaum's visit.</p>
      <p>"Have we all gone mad? Closing roads in Jerusalem for the arrival of the anti-Zionist Satmar leader who objects to the existence of the State of Israel. I don't understand how he is permitted to enter the state?"</p>
