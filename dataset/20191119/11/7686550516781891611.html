      <h1>Big cat fear after foal found dead in field</h1>
      <h2>The horse appears to have been partially eaten</h2>

      <p>Experts fear a big cat could be on the loose after a foal was found dead in a field - with a huge wound in his stomach.</p>
      <p>A ferocious feline may be responsible for killing the colt and disembowelling it, after he was found dead in a field in Kent with a giant hole in its stomach.</p>
      <p>The young horse was found lying on his side in his field in Greenhithe last week.</p>
      <p>The foal was seen alive the day before when he was in good health.</p>
      <p>Rik Snook, formerly of Big Cats of Britain, has a long history of tracking big cats across Kent and Sussex.</p>
      <p>He says the foal was probably killed and eaten by a big cat, but would not like to speculate which type.</p>
      <p>Rik said: “It is definitely possible a big cat is responsible.</p>
      <p>“There have been reported sightings in the area.</p>
      <p>“It is pretty common a big cat would want to go after a young horse. It would be the upper size of what the cat would go after, but it’s definitely not unusual.”</p>
      <p>The RSPCA was alerted after a four-month-old piebald foal was found gutted in a field in Greenhithe on November 10.</p>
      <p>RSPCA inspector Kirsten Ormerod said: “There was no obvious signs of ill health from what I could see looked in good body condition. <br/><br/>“It is possible he had died from natural causes and then unfortunately been scavenged on but his owner is understandably concerned so we are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.</p>
      <p>“We urge anyone with information to contact our appeals line in complete confidence.”</p>
      <p>Many believe Britain has an elusive population of wild big cats, with many people reporting sightings in rural areas. <br/><br/>Often described as panthers or pumas, others are unconvinced with many sightings often turning out to be misidentified large domestic cats. <br/><br/>However on several occasions, genuine big cats have been captured and identified in Britain.</p>
      <p>Sceptics say these were likely animals that had been kept illegally and escaped, or even released after the animals became too difficult to manage.</p>
