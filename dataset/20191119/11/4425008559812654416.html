      <h1>Internet shutdown for Iran amidst nationwide protests</h1>
      <h2>Third day of disconnect.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:37:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/author/juha-saarinen-224495" target="_blank">Juha Saarinen</a></address>
      <p>Authorities in the Islamic Republic of Iran have ordered providers in the country to shutdown internet access, after widespread protests over petrol price increases rock the nation.</p>
      <p>Oracle's Internet Intelligence arm noted observed that three-quarters of packet traces to Iran are failing for the third day running, and that many border gateway protocol (BGP) routes have been withdrawn.</p>

      <p>This amounts to an outright disconnection of Iran from the global internet, Oracle said.</p>
      <p>Digital rights organisation Netblocks said the shutdown was almost total with national connectivity at just five per cent of usual levels, and mobile operatorsÂ MCI, Rightel and IranCell being offline.</p>
      <p><i>Reuters</i> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-gasoline-protests-khamenei/irans-khamenei-backs-fuel-price-hike-blames-sabotage-for-unrest-idUSKBN1XR064">reported</a> that riot police has been clashing with protesters nationwide, after the Iranian government announced petrol price hikes.</p>
      <p>One policeman has died and thousands of protesters have been arrested with hundreds of banks torched in the riots.</p>
      <p>The White House has <a href="https://twitter.com/statedeptspox/status/1195845069779148806">condemned</a> the use of lethal force by Iran, and the communications shutdown, saying protesters should be allowed to speak.</p>
      <p>Cutting off internet access has become increasingly common in recent years to prevent protesters from using social media and other communications channels to record police brutality and to organise themselves.</p>
      <p>Venezuela, Equador, Egypt, India, and Iraq have instigated temporary internet blocks this year amidst unrest.</p>
