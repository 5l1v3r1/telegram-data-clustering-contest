      <h1>Tottenham ‘serious’ about signing – Spurs interest is ‘more than the others’</h1>

      <p>Hakim Ziyech is likely to get a lot of attention leading up to next summer’s transfer window, and perhaps around the winter market as well.</p>
      <p>The Ajax forward has scored six goals in 20 appearances so far this season, and added a rather impressive 15 assists. He’s been playing mainly on the right, but is flexible in his position and could suit a number of formations.</p>
      <p>Signing for Ajax in 2016 from FC Twente, the 26 year old is getting to the stage that he needs to take the next step, should the right opportunity become available.</p>
      <p>That could be at Tottenham.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/roma-e-napoli-occhi-su-ziyech-ma-c-e-un-club-che-fa-sul-serio-94361">Calciomercato</a> report AS Roma have been keen for a while and continue to follow the player, along with Napoli and AC Milan. However, it’s claimed that Tottenham are ‘serious’ about signing the player and their interest is ‘more than the others’.</p>
      <p>Spurs being keen makes things difficult for Roma, and it’s even stated that with Lorenzo Pellegrini also being linked to Tottenham recently, he and Ziyech could end up alongside each other at Spurs rather than the Serie A club.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, in his Tuesday De Telegraaf column, Ajax’s Edwin van der Sar made it clear Ajax will see sales again next summer.</p>
