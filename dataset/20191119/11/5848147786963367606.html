      <h1>Josh Frydenberg wants Australians to work for longer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:36:01+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/daniel-mcculloch/" target="_blank">Daniel McCulloch</a></address>
      <p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is concerned Australia’s ageing population is an “economic time bomb” for the national economy.</p>
      <p>He wants older Australians to work for longer to help keep the nation afloat.</p>
      <p>However, Labor has accused the treasurer of simply wanting to keep workers chained to their tools and desks “until they drop”.</p>
      <p>Advocacy group Nationals Seniors Australia has also suggested Mr Frydenberg could be unintentionally engaging in ageism by implying older people were a burden.</p>
      <p>Mr Frydenberg will use a speech on Tuesday to call for a boost to workforce participation rates for over-65s, in an attempt to grow an economy saddled with debt.</p>
      <p>“As a nation, we need to effectively leverage the three P’s – population, participation and productivity – to meet this challenge,” he will tell the Committee for Economic Development of Australia in Sydney.</p>
      <p>Mr Frydenberg will also argue keeping the budget in surplus is important to meet the long-term challenge of an ageing population and head off debt bills.</p>

      <p>“If we don’t remain fiscally disciplined today, the next generation will have to pick up the bill tomorrow,” he will say.</p>
      <p>Labor frontbencher Jason Clare says the Morrison government “have got form” on making people work for longer.</p>
      <p>“They tried to increase pension to 70. They’ve cut the pension or they’ve frozen superannuation before. There are no new ideas here,” he told Sky News.</p>
      <p>“It’s just Frydenberg digging up the old ideas of getting people to work longer.”</p>
      <p>Mr Clare said one-quarter of people on the Newstart allowance were over 55.</p>
      <p>“How about thinking about how we can help some of those that are on the dole now that are 55, thrown on the economic scrap heap, can’t find a job for love or money,” he said.</p>
      <p>He called for more TAFE and training funding to help older people get back into jobs.</p>
      <p>Workforce participation for over-65s stands at 14.6 per cent, up from six per cent 20 years ago.</p>
      <p>But Mr Frydenberg says 80 per cent of education happens before Australians turn 21.</p>
      <p>“This will have to change if we want to continue to see more Australians stay engaged in work for longer.”</p>
      <p>He will point to Australia’s higher life expectancy, a growing national median age and a shrinking number of working-age Australians.</p>
      <p>Ian Henschke from National Seniors Australia likened the treasurer’s “time bomb” analogy to previous warnings about an ageing “tidal wave” or “tsunami”.</p>
      <p>“Rather than stigmatise older Australians, we should blame previous treasurers from 1980 who have stood by and watched this happen,” Mr Henschke said.</p>
      <p>“Let’s deal with the facts, for example, that older Australians are wanting to work more and longer but they are not getting the work they need.”</p>
      <p>“When they do retrain, we know they are experiencing discrimination.”</p>
