      <p>Rupert Grint told <a href="https://www.etonline.com/rupert-grint-says-he-always-saw-sparks-between-emma-watson-and-tom-felton-exclusive-136582">Entertainment Tonight’s Rachel Smith</a> that there “were some sparks” between <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/emma-watson">Emma Watson</a> and <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/tom-felton">Tom Felton</a> while they were filming <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/harry-potter">“Harry Potter.”</a></p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of his new AppleTV+ thriller series “The Servant,” the Ron Weasley star said: “There was always something [between them].</p>
      <p>“There was a little bit of a spark.”</p>
      <p>He stipulated that he didn’t wish to fan rumors about their romance now, though. “We were kids,” he said. “It was like any kind of playground romance.”</p>
      <p>Grant said that he himself did not have a similar connection with any fellow cast members: “I was spark-free.”</p>
      <p>In recent months, fans have been begging for “Dramione” (Draco and Hermione) to couple up after Felton shared images on Instagram of him and Watson <a href="https://www.insider.com/tom-felton-shares-photo-emma-watson-harry-potter-fans-2019-8">hanging out in South Africa in August.</a></p>

      <p>Watson previously acknowledged having a crush on Felton while they filmed the “Harry Potter” movie series.</p>
      <p>“Between the ages of 10 and 12, I had a really terrible crush on Tom Felton,” she told British TV’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSshn6nGONs">“The Jonathan Ross Show” in 2012</a>.</p>
      <p>“We love a bad guy and he was a few years older and he had a skateboard. And that just did it, really. He used to do tricks on it. He was so cool.”</p>
      <p>It seems the feelings weren’t reciprocated at the time, however: “He totally knew [I had a crush]. And the thing is, he’d turn and go, ‘Oh, I see her in a younger sisterly way.’ And it just broke my heart, still does.”</p>
      <p>Felton later said that he was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H17Hmo8H118">very flattered</a> by Watson’s crush but that nothing of a romantic nature ever happened between them – “Sorry to disappoint,” he told <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/754547/did-harry-potter-s-tom-felton-have-a-crush-on-emma-watson-who-used-to-dig-him">E!
