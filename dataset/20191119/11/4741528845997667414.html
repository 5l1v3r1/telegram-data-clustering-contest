      <p>Enugu, Sokoto, Owerri, Eket and other 12 cities are expected to benefit from the launch of 9mobile’s 4G network in the next few months, according to <a href="https://punchng.com/9mobile-plans-4g-roll-out-in-16-cities/">Punch.</a></p>
      <p><b>This was disclosed by Stephane Beuvelet</b>, acting Managing Director, who noted that these improvements are to make their network better for their numerous subscribers.</p>
      <p>“<i>You will see that the first result of this injection in the next couple of weeks actually because we are almost ready to start massive roll-out of our infrastructure. We are planning to roll out 4G at a minimum of 16 cities, some existing and other new cities.

      <p><b>Explaining the motive</b> behind 9mobile’s choice to establish 4G internet connection in 16 cities, Beuvelet said the selected cities were in demand for more data, hence the company’s decision to invest in better infrastructure.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“<i>We believe that these are the cities where there is more demand for data. We believe that 4G is an enabler for doing business, entertainment and solving problems in Nigeria.</i></p>
      <p><i>“There is a long list of cities where we don’t have 4G and this is really good news for the company to be able to start again and offer cheaper quality services to our customers,</i>” Beuvelet explained.</p>
      <p><b>As a solution to widening</b> the company’s reach, the acting MD said plans were underway to engage smart off-grid technologies to power the firm’s infrastructure.</p>
      <p>“<i>What we found out was that in the past, there was no economical way to provide coverage in rural areas and we found out that with this partnership, it is a very effective way to provide coverage in rural areas. This is a proof of concept for this company to provide innovative solar-based satellite solutions, which is low-cost and will allow coverage in remote areas</i>,” he added.</p>
      <p><b>In a recent Nairametrics article</b>, the acting Managing Director of 9mobile, Stephane Beuvelet blamed poor quality of service on the construction of roads.</p>
      <p><b>Beuvelet noted that</b> it was the destruction of 9mobile’s fibre during road construction as well as constant vandalism of their infrastructure <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2019/11/17/9mobile-md-blames-poor-service-on-road-construction/">affected its overall network quality</a>.</p>
