      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> is going to undertake the hardest <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here!</a> trial yet tonight as she, quite literally, prepares to face her fears.</p>
      <p>In a clip from tonight’s episode, viewers can see the reality TV icon caught between a rock and a hard place, overrun with slithering snakes.</p>
      <p>The Olympic gold medalist takes on Face Your Fears, where she has to un-screw the two stars she needs to win for her campmates.</p>
      <p>The only problem? She has to get these stars whilst feeling through a box positively brimming with the slippery reptiles.</p>

      <p>Oh, and she has a giant fish-bowl strapped over her head, blocking her vision. This is, of course, filled with snakes too. Not ideal, really.</p>

      <p>Her campmates – Jacqueline Jossa, James Haskell, Ian Wright and Andrew Maxwell – can be seen cheering the 70 year-old on from the sidelines as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-and-dec/">Ant and Dec</a> watch on.</p>
      <p>‘Brush the snake off slowly otherwise you’re going to get a little nip,’ EastEnders actress Jossa advises.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn seems to get in a bit of bother, however, as her vision being blocked means she struggles to actually un-screw the much-needed stars from their position in the box in front of her.</p>
      <p>This comes just a day after the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/im-celebrity-2019-kate-garraway-another-nightmare-bushtucker-trial-caitlyn-jenner-11174977/">faced off with Good Morning Britain presenter Kate Garraway</a> – which was clearly a nightmare for them both.</p>
      <p>In that trial, Caitlyn kept a very calm composure as Kate…well…didn’t. And this impressive streak of nonchalance seems to continue in this new trial.</p>
      <p>We don’t think we’d be quite so calm with an actual snake crawling by our face, however.</p>

      <p>In other I’m A Celeb news, Capital FM DJ and fellow contestant Roman Kemp opened up last night on his late, great godfather George Michael, even telling a story <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebrity-roman-kemp-reveals-george-michael-gatecrashed-dad-martins-first-date-mum-shirlie-11180122/">about the Faith singer accompanying his mother and father – Martin and Shirlie Kemp – on their first date</a>.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Viewers also seemed to be quite baffled when Radio 1 fixture Adele Roberts <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/im-celebrity-fans-baffled-adele-roberts-chooses-framed-photo-jane-mcdonald-luxury-item-11178692/">brought a framed picture of Jane Macdonald into the jungle with her</a>. Yes, really.</p>
      <p>But apparently, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/jane-mcdonald-absolutely-thrilled-adele-roberts-bringing-framed-photo-im-celebrity-camp-11179207/">Jane herself is loving it</a>.</p>
