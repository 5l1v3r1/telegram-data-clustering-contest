      <h2>Graeme Hughes was found dead at his home in North Muirton on November 4</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:16:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:16</time> by <a rel="author">Perthshire Advertiser, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/perthshire-advertiser/</a></address>
      <p>A 31-year-old man has made a second appearance in private at Perth Sheriff Court, this time via video link, in connection with the death of a local man on a city housing estate.</p>
      <p>James Williamson, of Mull Place, is accused of killing 47-year-old Graeme Hughes who was found dead at his home in Uist Place, North Muirton, on November 4, 2019.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that he assaulted the father-of-three by repeatedly punching him on the head and body.</p>
      <p>As a consequence, it is claimed that Mr Hughes suffered a heart attack - and that Williamson was responsible for his death.</p>
      <p>The accused also faces a further charge of attacking - and then spitting - on employee Ali Canavci at the Istanbul take-away on Perth’s Argyll Road, also on November 4.</p>
      <p>He is said to have repeatedly punched the other man on the head and body.</p>
      <p>A third charge alleges that Williamson behaved in a threatening and abusive manner at the food premises by shouting, swearing and repeatedly demanding money from staff.</p>
      <p>He is also said to have uttered racist remarks and made violent threats.</p>
      <p>It is further alleged that the accused repeatedly shouted, swore, acted aggressively and made violent threats at Perth Police HQ and PRI’s A&amp;E Department on November 4.</p>
      <p>Williamson was fully committed for trial and was remanded in custody meantime.</p>
      <p>Tributes have been paid to Mr Hughes on Facebook, with his aunt, Fiona Kaszta, stating: “It’s like a bad dream, just can’t take it in. He lit up a room the minute he walked in and was always the joker.</p>
      <p>“He will be sorely missed by all family and friends.”</p>
      <p>Flowers and other tributes were subsequently laid in Mr Hughes’ front garden by family and friends.</p>
