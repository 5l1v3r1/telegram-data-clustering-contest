      <p>“The signs are good, the signs are positive and we've talked about things that we can improve on and how we're going to try to improve by the end of the season, which is the business end of the season as well.</p>
      <p>”We always have meetings [to discuss formations and tactics], that's normal. It’s a normal thing to have meetings and for everybody to discuss, that’s a normal thing and the sign of a healthy dressing room.</p>
      <p>"Boys speaking among it in the changing room, saying what they think we can improve on and what are good ideas as well.</p>

      <p>“There’s plenty going on, it’s not a place to be quiet and in your shell. It’s time for people to really step up and start doing their jobs as well.”</p>
      <p>McTominay, who has been an ever-present so far in the Premier League, has pointed at the return of Anthony Martial as a key moment in United's season.</p>
      <p>“There are very positive signs and things are changing. Everybody is looking forward to the next game and wanting that next game to come as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>”I think people forget that we have had a lot of injuries as well, and you can see with Anthony coming back what a difference he makes. Which is what the manager has said about him as well.</p>
      <p>"I do think we’ve coped relatively well with a small squad and a lot of boys playing a lot of minutes in a short space of time.</p>
      <p>”Everybody wants to play and that’s the sign of a healthy dressing room.“</p>
