      <p>Battery life is up to 10 hours (according to Apple) so you don’t have to carry a power bank with you all the time. Thanks to the A12 Bionic chip, you can jump between apps without missing a beat. There is a 10.5-inch Retina display thrown into the mix with True Tone and wide color gamut for stunning visuals. Sadly though, there is no ProMotion here, a feature which Apple reserves for its higher-end, Pro models.</p>
      <p>All the latest models of iPad Air (10.5-inch) are available on discount currently, some of the features are listed below;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Display - 10.5-inch Retina display</li>
