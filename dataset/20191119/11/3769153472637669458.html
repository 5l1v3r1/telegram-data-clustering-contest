      <blockquote>So, finally my over 12 hours long course in Udemy about how to create, work with and apply materials in Blender cycles is alive!<br/><br/>That means nearly 100 video chapters that covers everything from your first baby steps in to the Shader editor until you can leave the course, feeling confident and sure about how you handle almost any task related to materials. A lot of practical examples and you are never alone. I'm always there if it should be anything at all around this course.<br/><br/>NB! I have also added a big discount the first month to the course, so jump right in there and start twisting, turning and adding those nodes :).</blockquote>
