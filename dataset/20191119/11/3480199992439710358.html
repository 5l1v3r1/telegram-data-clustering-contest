      <p>Boris Johnson is about to avoid the dubious honour of being the UK’s shortest-serving prime minister.</p>
      <p>Tuesday November 19 marks the 119th day of Mr Johnson’s premiership.</p>
      <p>This is the same number of days clocked up as prime minister by George Canning in 1827, before he died in office.</p>
      <p>Mr Canning currently holds the record for being the shortest-serving PM in UK history.</p>

      <p>Assuming Mr Johnson makes it unscathed into his 120th day on Wednesday, George Canning’s record will remain intact.</p>
      <p>If the Conservatives lose the General Election on December 12, Mr Johnson would become the prime minister with the second shortest time in office.</p>
      <p>But if he continues as PM, he will overtake another of his Tory predecessors just three days later, on December 15.</p>
      <p>On this date he will pass the 1st Viscount Goderich, who served as prime minister for 144 days in 1827-28.</p>
