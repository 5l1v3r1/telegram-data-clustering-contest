      <p><b>Chennai:</b> Two IIT-Madras students, who had embarked on an indefinite 'hunger strike' following the death of a girl student announced withdrawal of their protest on Tuesday following assurace from the management to meet their key demands.</p>
      <p>"We have called off the (hunger) strike," Azhar Moideen, a final year Humanities student, told PTI.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>They had launched the indefinite fast on the campus, demanding an internal inquiry into the conduct of faculty as sought by the family of a woman student who committed suicide recently.</p>
      <p>The fast was called off following assurance from the Dean that two of their demands would be implemented "at the earliest," while that for a probe into the conduct of faculty would be discussed with the Director later, he said.</p>
      <p>The Director was currently not in town and this subject came under his jurisdiction, Moideen said quoting the Dean.</p>
      <p>Moideen said the Dean has sent a mail to all the students, assuring their demands for setting up complaints and redressal system in every department would be implemented "at the earliest", besides a study on external issues faced by the students at the premier technical varsity.</p>
      <p>Moideen and another student had embarked on an indefinite fast on Monday, following the alleged suicide of Fathima Latheef, a first year Humanities student hailing from Kerala.</p>
