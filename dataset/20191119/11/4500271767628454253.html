      <p>Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday hailed the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1517577/current-account-rises-into-surplus">$99 million current account surplus</a> posted in October — after a gap of more than four years — saying the country's economy was finally heading in the right direction.</p>
      <p>"Pakistan economy finally heading in right direction as more of our economic reforms bear fruit: Pak's current account turned into surplus in Oct 2019, for first time in 4 yrs. Current account balance was +$99mn in Oct 2019 compared to -$284mn in Sept 2019 &amp; -$1,280mn in Oct 2018," he said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"For first 4 months of our fiscal year, our current account deficit has fallen by 73.5% compared to same period last fiscal year. Our exports of goods &amp; services in Oct 2019 rose 20% over previous month and 9.6% over Oct 2018. I congratulate our exporters &amp; encourage them to do more," added the premier.</p>

      <p>The latest data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) showed the government has succeeded in bringing down the current account deficit.</p>
      <p>The data for October showed the current account was positive 99m against a net deficit of $1.28bn in the same month of previous fiscal year.</p>
      <p>The surplus in October and narrowing of four-month current account deficit was mainly achieved due to a massive cut in the imports’ bill. The government is facing criticism that the massive decline in imports have slowdown overall economic activities which would ultimately hit the GDP growth rate.</p>
      <p>The SBP governor, however, said the fall in current account deficit is a big achievement for country and is a sign of macroeconomic stability.</p>
