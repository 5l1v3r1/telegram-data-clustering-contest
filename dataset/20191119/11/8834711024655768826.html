      <h1>AgriSA Report: At least R600 Million Needed To Help Drought-Stricken Farmers</h1>

      <p>Severe cash flow problems and depleted animal feed reserves are now characterising the Northern Cape’s lingering drought.</p>
      <p>AgriSA recently released its latest agriculture drought report which takes a look at the overall drought situation across the country.</p>
      <p>As a temporary solution, experts said that at least R600 million over the next three months was needed to assist farmers.</p>
      <p>At least 15,500 farms spanning over 27 million hectares were gripped by severe drought conditions across the province.</p>
      <p>Head of the organisation’s disaster management centre, Willem Symington, said the sector employed around 33,000 workers, with many of these jobs now being threatened as a result of the drought.</p>
      <p>“The effects are not great. In the short term, local economies need to be supported.”</p>
      <p>Symington stressed that more should be done politically to drive relief interventions.</p>
      <p>“On a political level, it seems like we’re struggling to get some action or attention in the province on this problem.”</p>
      <p>The government earlier this year granted R30 million towards drought relief.</p>
