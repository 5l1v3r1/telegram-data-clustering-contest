      <p><b>Michael McDonald</b> is reuniting with <b>The Doobie Brothers</b> for the band’s 50th anniversary, hitting the road for a 2020 tour that will have them out from June through October. This will be the first time McDonald, Tom Johnston, Patrick Simmons, and John McFee have toured together in 25 years. “We’re truly excited about our 50th Anniversary Tour, as it’s a celebration of the band’s entire history,” Johnston said. “We’ll be performing songs from our full catalog, as well as new music.” Can someone get Kenny Loggins and Steely Dan to join this road show?</p>
      <p>The tour includes NYC-area shows at <b>PNC Bank Arts Center on June 29</b> and <b>Jones Beach on June 30</b>. <b><a href="http://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/259789/264167/4272?u=https://www.ticketmaster.com/the-doobie-brothers-tickets/artist/734946">Tickets</a></b> for the whole tour go on sale December 6 at 10 AM local time.</p>
      <p>The Doobie Brothers made the announcement Monday night at their show at Nashville’s Ryman Auditorium where McDonald was a surprise guest during the encore. “You might remember him from, well, he has his own band these days,” Simmons told the crowd, <i>Rolling Stone</i> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/doobie-brothers-michael-mcdonald-50th-anniversary-tour-914341/">notes</a>. “But you might remember him from his band, the Doobie Brothers — Mr. Michael McDonald!” They then closed out the night with “Taking it to the Streets.”</p>
