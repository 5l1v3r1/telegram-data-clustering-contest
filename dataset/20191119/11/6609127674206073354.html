      <p>The Hoff struck up a fondness for the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14922/partick-thistle/">Thistle</a> after making a joke about them during a panto appearance in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>But he has clearly not brushed up on where the team play as he made an error talking about the club on Zoe Ball's Radio 2 breakfast show.</p>
      <p>When reading out questions from listeners for Hasselhoff, host Zoe Ball asked if he would ever go to watch a Partick Thistle match.</p>
      <p>And the Hoff was certain he would as he insisted he'd love to watch them in action.</p>
      <p>He said: "If Partick Thistle comes to the UK I would definitely go and see them.</p>
      <p>"I love Partick Thistle.</p>
      <p>"I made a joke about them in a panto and I said 'the only thing lower than low is Partick Thistle'.</p>
      <p>"I the said 'what's a Partick Thistle?' and they showed me the team and I fell in love with the guys because its been around for a long time.</p>
      <p>"They actually won two or three games in a row when I supported them."</p>
