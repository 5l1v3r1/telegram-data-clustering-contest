      <p><b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Independence_Hall_1">Independence Hall</a></b>, who transformed from a Parx maiden special weight winner to the early <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/p/c/Kentucky_Derby_2020_Contenders">2020 Kentucky Derby</a></b> favorite earlier this month, still has undetermined next race plans.</p>
      <p>But one thing’s for sure, says trainer Michael Trombetta: The Constitution colt won’t be lining up next in Aqueduct's Dec. 7 Remsen Stakes (G2), previously said to be a possibility.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 3, Independence Hall rolled to a 12 1/4-length win over the same surface when winning the Nashua Stakes (G3) at a mile. The effort was good for a 101 Beyer Speed Figure, best of the 2-year-old crop, and followed a Sept. 21 debut victory.</p>
      <p>“When they run that fast, you worry about a regression, which happens to many of them,” Trombetta said. “The horse is doing great, but we just want to give him a little space if we can now that he has two races under his belt. I’m not 100% sure what the next start will be, to be honest.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got some ideas but just didn’t want to run back in five weeks.”</p>
      <p>Trombetta will speak with ownership in Independence Hall before making firm plans. He does intend to start the colt once more before his Fair Hill string in Maryland ships to Florida for the winter.</p>
      <p>“The main focus is just getting back into the right race,” Trombetta said. “I don’t know all of what’s out there to be honest with you.”</p>
      <p>Two options appear to make the most sense.</p>
      <p>On Dec. 28, Laurel Park hosts the $100,000 Heft Stakes, a 7/8-mile event in which the Trombetta-trained Win Win Win ran second last year. That colt, of course, also went on to run in the Kentucky Derby.</p>
      <p>Days later on Jan. 1, Aqueduct runs the Jerome Stakes, which offers Derby qualifying points on a 10-4-2-1 basis to its Top 4 finishers. That event runs at the same mile trip as the Nashua.</p>
      <p>Independence Hall was listed this week as low as 8-1 to win the Derby by William Hill U.S. A pari-mutuel opinion will be formed of him later this month when Churchill Downs runs Pool 1 of the Kentucky Derby Future Wager from Nov. 28-Dec. 1.</p>
      <p>Independence Hall, a $200,000 RNA as a 2-year-old, wound up with Kathleen and Robert Verratti going first out. Upon breaking his maiden on the Sept. 21 Pennsylvania Derby day undercard, Eclipse Thoroughbred Partners and Twin Creeks Racing Stables bought in, forming a powerhouse partnership for a colt that bears watching into prep season.</p>
