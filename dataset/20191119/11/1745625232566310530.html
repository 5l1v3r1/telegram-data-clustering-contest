      <h3>Mel B Talks Dating Women &amp; The Five-Year Relationship She Had With Ex-Girlfriend</h3>

      <p><a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/mel-b">Mel B</a> has always been open about dating both sexes and has discussed on her podcast, <i>The Truth Flirts</i>, what she feels the difference is between men and women when it comes to relationships. On the fifth episode, she used her five-year relationship with a woman as an example, per <i><a href="http://www.music-news.com/news/UK/126415/Mel-B-says-lesbian-porn-is-nicer-and-kinder">Music News</a></i>.</p>
      <p>Mel admitted that her relationship to Christine Crokos was “really beautiful” and that they hardly ever argued.</p>
      <p>“I do think that dating women is very different to dating men…” she said.</p>
      <p>“I had a five-year relationship with a woman and it was an intense five years but it was actually a really beautiful five years,” the “Feel So Good” hitmaker continued.</p>
      <blockquote>“We barely kind of argued because we both thought the same, wanted the same out of life. It was really interesting when I actually compare it to my other relationships.”</blockquote>
      <p>When talking about first dates, Mel admitted that looks are important for first impressions because it’s the first thing you see.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old got real and said she prefers to watch lesbian porn because she believes it’s more sensual.</p>
      <p>“Lesbian porn is more sensual, I think anyway. It’s nicer and kinder,” the “Who Do You Think You Are” chart-topper remarked.</p>
      <p>The Spice Girl has three daughters — Phoenix Chi Gulzar, Angel Murphy Brown, and Madison Brown Belafonte — with three different fathers. Her oldest, Phoenix, 20, had the sex talk with her mom when she was 16.</p>
      <p>Mel recently admitted that she found it “cringey” when she explained it to her but was very to the point on the subject.</p>

      <blockquote>“We spoke about contraception thoroughly, about condoms, what happens when you don’t use a condom, which I think terrified her.”</blockquote>
      <p>In a different episode, Mel expressed that she’s a little scared to start dating again after her abusive ex-husband, Stephen Belafonte.</p>
      <p>As previously reported by <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5739492/mel-b-scared-dating-abusive-ex/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a>, she accused Belafonte of controlling her for many years and came between her and her family.</p>
      <p>Mel stated that she’s currently single after always being in long-term relationships and is unsure whether that’s a good thing or not.</p>
      <p>Last year, she released a <i>Sunday Times</i> bestselling memoir, <i>Brutally Honest</i>, to discuss her life, including the 10-year struggle of her recent marriage with Stephen. Mel did a few talks across the U.K. to raise awareness to others who are going through a similar situation and to promote the book. In the autobiography, she declared that the split left her with less than $800 and that her $80 million fortune was controlled by Belafonte, per <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/11/17/mel-b-reveals-left-800-bitter-split-fromstephen-belafonte/"><i>The Telegraph</i></a>.</p>
