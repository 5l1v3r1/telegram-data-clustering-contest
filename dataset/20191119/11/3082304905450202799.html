        <b>Chelsea take on Manchester City in the Premier League this weekend, and it is undoubtedly the standout fixture of this particular matchday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The last time Chelsea went to the Etihad Stadium it was a rather embarrassing occasion for the Blues, finding themselves on the wrong end of a 6-0 scoreline that outlined the difference between the two sides.</p>
      <p>However, this season Chelsea have been particularly impressive under new manager Frank Lampard, and chances of another 6-0 look rather unlikely.</p>

      <p>Eden Hazard was a part of that game where the Londoners were drubbed away from home, but even he believes that his former employers are in a much better position now, and can possibly even win this game.</p>
      <p>“Of course they can beat Man City. It’s not going to be easy, it’s hard to play there and last time we played there we lost 6-0,” he said to Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>“So it’s bad memories for me and for Chelsea as well but I think this season they are really good. They are really young but really good, so why not go there and win the game?”</p>
      <p>Chelsea currently sit in the top four of the Premier League table and are actually one point ahead of Man City as things stand.</p>
