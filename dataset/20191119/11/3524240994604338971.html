      <p>The Woman Leader of Wada/Aro Campaign Council, Ochadamu Ward, Mrs Acheju Abuh, was on Monday afternoon reportedly burnt alive in her home by suspected political thugs.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that the thugs who were shooting indiscriminately arrived Mrs Abuh’s house around 2.00 p.m. and surrounded the house, blocking every exit and escape route from outside.</p>
      <p>They then poured petrol on the building before setting it ablaze, while terrified villagers watched from afar.</p>
      <p>Mrs Abuh reportedly attempted to escape through a window but couldn’t due to the metal burglary proof and gunshots that were alleged raining in her direction.</p>
      <p>A source said that “the bloodthirsty thugs waited, shooting and watching with relish while Mrs Abuh cried from inside the inferno until her voice died out.”</p>
      <p>They reportedly left only when the entire house and Mrs Abuh had been burnt to ashes.</p>
      <p>The Kogi State police command confirmed the incident through its public relations officer, DSP William Ayah.</p>
