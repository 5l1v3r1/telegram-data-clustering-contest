      <h1>Nelson welcomes delegation of climate change experts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:55:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Nelson_City_Council" target="_blank">Nelson City Council</a></address>
      <p>Nelson’s Mayor say this week’s delegation of climate change experts from Denmark is a sign our city is leading the charge for change in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>A cohort of researchers, industry experts and Government officials has arrived in Nelson for the Denmark Climatorium Delegation Mission.</p>
      <p>They will be meeting with council, iwi, business, Government, research, school and community representatives from across the top of the South.</p>
      <p>Arranged by Wakatū Incorporated, the visit began this afternoon with a pōwhiri at Whakatū Marae, welcoming the international visitors to the city.</p>
      <p>Following a discussion session this afternoon, Nelson’s Mayor, Rachel Reese, will then host a dinner for the delegation at NMIT tonight.</p>
      <p>“It’s a real honour to welcome the Danish delegation to our city, giving us the opportunity to share experience and ideas.</p>
      <p>“As one of the first councils in New Zealand to declare a climate emergency, we feel privileged to have been given this opportunity to engage with such a forward-thinking and proactive panel,” she said.</p>
      <p>The visit also includes a round table discussion on carbon neutral savings, a trip to Marahau to investigate the pressure of large visitor numbers in isolated communities, and a climate schools presentation.</p>
      <p>The trip will conclude with meetings at Nelson City Council, the Cawthron, NIWA, Plant and Food and Nelson Artificial Intelligence.</p>
