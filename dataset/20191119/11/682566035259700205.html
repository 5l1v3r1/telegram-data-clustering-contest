      <p>Cape Town - <b>South Africa U-23</b> head coach <b>David Notoane</b> said his side are hoping to emulate <b>Bafana Bafana</b> with victory over <b>Egypt</b> in a <b>U-23 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON</b>) semi-final clash on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Amaglulug are aiming to secure their place in next year's Tokyo Olympic Games when they face the in-form hosts at the Cairo International Stadium.</p>
      <p>It will be a repeat fixture that the Egyptians will be looking to forget after the senior side crashed out of the 2019 AFCON at the hands of Bafana Bafana in the last 16 stage.</p>
      <p>Egypt go into the game as clear favourites after registering three wins from as many games - over Mali, Ghana and Cameroon - which saw The Pharaohs topping Group A.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Notoane's side reached the semi-finals built on a resolute defence that is yet to concede a goal, while clinching a solitary win over the Ivory Coast.</p>
      <p>Coupled with two goalless draws against neighbours Zambia and holders Nigeria, that was enough to see them finishing Group B in second place and stand a chance to clinch a second successive appearance at the Olympics.</p>
      <p>"We are inspired by our senior team," Notoane said. "Who defeated Egypt at home at the 2019 AFCON earlier this year. We know how strong the Egyptians are, but we also know how to deal with them."</p>
      <p>Amagluglug goalkeeper Darren Johnson shared the same sentiment that his team-mates were aiming to beat their opponents in their backyard.</p>
      <p>"This is a huge game and will be a tough encounter," Johnson said. "We came to Egypt to lift the title and we head into the clash with no fear.</p>
      <p>"Having not conceded a goal yet throughout the tournament makes me proud, but what's more important is to see my team winning. We'll try to imitate our seniors and beat Egypt at their home."</p>
      <p>Kick-off is at 20:00.</p>
