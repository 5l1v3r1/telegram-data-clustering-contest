      <h3>Limerick people and businesses are being asked to ‘Purple Up’ on November 28<sup>th</sup> as part of an action to mark the global 16 Days of Action Opposing Violence Against Women.</h3>
      <p>This year will be the 5th Purple Up event to take place in Limerick.</p>
      <p>Organised by Limerick Area Network on Violence Against Women (LAN), Purple Up aims to highlight the prevalence of violence against women in society. As part of the Purple Up campaign, shops, schools, credit unions, banks, offices and organisations are asked to decorate their windows in purple and display posters supporting the campaign, along with members of the public being asked to wear something purple on the day.</p>
      <h4>The lunchtime event will take place on Thursday, November 28<sup>th</sup> between 1pm and 2pm on Thomas Street, Limerick.</h4>
      <p>There will be a brief talk from some of the agencies who are part of LAN, followed by the reading out of the names of women and children in Ireland who have died violently. Between 1996 and 2018 225 women in Ireland have died violently</p>
      <p>LAN Chairperson and Executive Director of Rape Crisis Midwest, Miriam Duffy, commented,</p>
      <blockquote>“Each year the list of names of women who have died violently in our country grows. This event is a space to remember them and to highlight the need to continue the work of all of us in society to prevent future tragedies.”</blockquote>
