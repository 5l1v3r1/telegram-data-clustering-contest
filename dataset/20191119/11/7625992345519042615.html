      <p>From Bon Appétit's November 2019 issue, a Thanksgiving recipe from Christina Chaey and Claire Saffitz:</p>
      <p>"This squash-centric salad has an irresistible pecan dressing and hardy radicchio that refuses to wilt. The palm-size 898 squash, a new cousin of the beloved honeynut developed by vegetable breeder–mad genius Michael Mazourek, tastes like a turbocharged butternut. It's now rolling out at farmers' markets, select grocery stores, and online grocers across the country.</p>
      <p>"Preheating the baking sheet will help the squash sizzle and sear as soon as it hits the pan rather than steam and stick."<br/>      </p>
      <h3>Squash and Radicchio Salad With Pecans</h3>
      <p>Recipe by Christina Chaey and Claire Saffitz<br/>Makes 8–10 servings</p>

      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Squash:</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Place racks in middle and lower third of oven and set a rimmed baking sheet on each; preheat oven to 450°. Toss squash with oil in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Remove baking sheets from oven and divide squash between them, arranging in a single layer. Roast, rotating sheets halfway through, until browned and tender, 15–25 minutes. Set squash aside; reduce oven temperature to 350°.</li>
        <li><b>Do Ahead:</b> Squash can be roasted 1 day ahead. Let cool, then transfer to an airtight container. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature or heat slightly in a microwave before using.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <i>
          <b>Vinaigrette and Assembly:</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toss pecans with 1 tsp. oil in a small bowl; season with salt. Toast on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing halfway through, until slightly darkened and fragrant, 8–10 minutes. Let cool, then coarsely chop. Set ½ cup pecans aside for serving.</li>
        <li>Blend shallot, orange juice, mustard, maple syrup, ¼ cup lemon juice, and remaining pecans in a blender until mostly smooth. With motor running, gradually stream in ½ cup oil and blend until emulsified and smooth. Season dressing with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Toss radicchio and half of dressing in a large bowl to coat; season with salt and pepper. Arrange on a platter. Toss reserved squash with remaining dressing in the same bowl to coat; season with salt and pepper. Arrange over radicchio.</li>
        <li>Toss Asian pear with 1 Tbsp. lemon juice in a small bowl. Top salad with Asian pear, cheese, parsley, and reserved pecans. Squeeze juice from lemon half over and drizzle with oil; season with more salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><b>Do Ahead:</b> Vinaigrette can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before using.</li>
      </ul>
