        <figcaption>Forest's thoughts will be turning to January window</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Nottingham Forest’s summer transfer business seems to have paid dividends, with the Reds battling at the top end of the Championship table.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/meet-12-nottingham-forests-summer-3190216">Twelve new signings</a> came through the City Ground doors as Sabri Lamouchi took hold of the reins.</p>
      <p>And the majority of those players have had an impact on the pitch, contributing to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-qpr-nottingham-forest-3551517">a fine start to the season</a> on the banks of the Trent.</p>
      <p>With January fast approaching, Forest will be hoping to work their magic in the market once again - and if the summer is anything to go by, the signs are good.</p>
      <p>The club managed to find some real gems in the last window, with the likes of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/brice-samba">Brice Samba</a>, Yuri Ribeiro, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/samba-sow">Samba Sow</a> and Tiago Silva all putting in good performances in the opening months of the campaign.</p>

      <p>Technical director Francois Modesto and head of international recruitment Jose Anigo both played a role in the Reds’ summer business.</p>
      <p>And with <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-january-transfer-news-3537390">Lamouchi having previously said</a> the pair are “working for the future”, they are sure to do so again in January.</p>
      <p>“Forest’s summer recruitment has proved to be pretty good,” says Reds reporter Sarah Clapson, in our latest Forest video.</p>
      <p>“For the most part they got it spot on.</p>
      <p>“They brought in players who have made an impact and made a difference.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got to be impressed with their summer business.</p>
      <p>“They’ve obviously got a team who can find players who fit into the way <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Sabri Lamouchi</a> wants to play - his system and his way of doing things.</p>
      <p>“They will be trying to reproduce that (success) again in January.”</p>
