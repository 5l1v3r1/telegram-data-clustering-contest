      <p>An injured man who lashed out at police officers at Monklands Hospital has been jailed.</p>
      <p>Gary Cunningham was taken to the A&amp;E department by cops in May to receive treatment for a stab wound to his head.</p>
      <p>While en route, Cunningham was verbally abusive to the officers and spat at one of their faces. To make matters worse, the Kilsyth resident then kicked an officer on the head.</p>
      <p>He was imprisoned for his aggressive actions at Airdrie Sheriff Court last week.</p>
      <p>The procurator fiscal said: “At 10pm police were requested to go to the locus due to someone being stabbed to the head.</p>
      <p>“When they arrived, they saw the accused with blood on his head. He became aggressive and shouted, ‘I’ll stab you in the eye’ to officers.</p>
      <p>“He was warned about his conduct but continued and shouted, ‘I’m going to bomb you’.</p>
      <p>“He was taken to Monklands Hospital and spat on an officer’s face. A spit hood was applied and he kicked an officer on the head.</p>
      <p>“He was then taken to Coatbridge police office and he said, ‘wait until I get you in the cell’ to an officer.</p>
      <p>“Officers went to the locus to find out how the accused obtained his injury and they found a cannabis cultivation consisting of 37 plant pots and six plants.”</p>

      <p>Cunningham’s defence solicitor said: “This is a terrible incident he’s pleaded guilty to.</p>
      <p>“He has a breach outstanding as well, which doesn’t help. He’s normally in full-time employment and if he’s released today he’ll go back to his roofing job.</p>
      <p>“He was associating with people he shouldn’t have been.</p>
      <p>“There are no further proceedings with the stabbing incident as it’s quite unclear how he obtained the injuries.”</p>
      <p>The solicitor continued: “A direct alternative is a restriction of liberty order. That will allow him to work and provide for his family.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t intend to drink any more and he’s suffering from depression. He’s apologised for his actions and pled guilty at the earliest opportunity.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Frank Pieri said: “This is a dreadful incident. You have a record and also have a breach outstanding.</p>
      <p>“I’ll sentence you to four months which is backdated to October 16 when you were remanded in custody.”</p>
