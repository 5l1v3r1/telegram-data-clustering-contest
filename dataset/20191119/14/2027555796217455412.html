      <h1>LS: Oppn condemns police action against JNU students</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:25:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Opposition members in Lok Sabha on Tuesday described as "suppression of voice" the alleged baton-charge by police on JNU students demanding total rollback of hostel fee hike.</p>
      <p>Raising the issue during Zero Hour, Saugata Roy (TMC), T N Prathapan (Cong) and Danish Ali (BSP) accused the government of using force to suppress the voice of students.</p>
      <p>Roy dubbed as "unfortunate" the use of force on students, saying the hike should be rolled back as poor students will find it difficult to pay the amount.</p>
      <p>Prathpan said the students are protesting for their rights. "The government is undemocratically suppressing their voice against fee hike. The government is ruining higher education institutions," he said.</p>
      <p>He also demanded a high-level probe into the "atrocities" committed against students of the university.</p>
      <p>Danish Ali too demanded a probe into the lathi-charge and sought an "apology" from the government.</p>
      <p>But Speaker Om Birla did not allow him to speak further as his Zero Hour notice was on another issue.</p>
