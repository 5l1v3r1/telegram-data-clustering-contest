      <h1>Jail employees arrested after Jeffrey Epstein's death: report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:57:56+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rachel-frazin" target="_blank">Rachel Frazin</a></address>
      <p>Two workers who were on duty in a New York City jail the night of Jeffrey Epstein's death were arrested Tuesday on federal charges related to their failure to check on him every half hour, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/nyregion/epstein-prison-guards-arrested.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share">The New York Times</a> reported, citing a person with knowledge.  </p>
      <p>The Bureau of Prisons employees are expected to be charged on Tuesday and appear in federal court.</p>
      <p>The Times, citing people with knowledge of the matter, said the workers are accused of falling asleep, not checking in on Epstein and falsifying records to cover up that they had not checked on the prisoner.</p>
      <p>The Associated Press had previously <a href="https://apnews.com/a442ac0894d0412cad9cb581d6cf5d56">reported</a> that two correctional officers guarding Epstein were <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/471023-epstein-guards-expected-to-face-criminal-charges-this-week">expected to face charges this week</a>.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons declined to comment. Epstein died in August at the Metropolitan Correction Center in Manhattan while he awaited a trial for sex trafficking charges. The incident was <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/457760-nyc-medical-examiner-confirms-epsteins-death-by-suicide-reports">ruled a suicide</a>. </p>
      <p>He had previously been convicted of a sexual misconduct charge in 2008, and his lenient plea agreement drew renewed scrutiny after a Miami Herald report last year. </p>
      <p>The Hill has reached out to the Bureau of Prisons for comment.</p>
