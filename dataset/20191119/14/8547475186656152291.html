        <b>Crisis talks are taking place to try and prevent 27 days of strikes across many of London's busiest commuter routes in December.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Union leaders and railway bosses remain at loggerheads as they attempt to resolve their dispute over the role of guards on trains and control of train doors.</p>
      <p>RMT union leaders and South Western Railway bosses are trying to come to an agreement before the strikes cause chaos for people heading home at Christmas.</p>
      <p>The action by SWR staff would affect services from Waterloo, the UK's busiest station, on almost every day in December.</p>
      <p>It would also be the longest period of concentrated strike action ever seen on British railways.</p>
      <p>Downing Street has condemned the action as “unacceptable”.</p>

      <p>Acas, the conciliation service, is bringing the two sides together for the first time since the strikes were ordered two weeks ago on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Based on previous walkouts, more than 16,000 services could be hit.</p>
      <p>The union said that the strike would cover every day in December except for Sunday 1 and Thursday 12, when the general election is taking place, and SWR does not run services on Christmas day and Boxing day.</p>
      <p>An SWR spokesman said: “We were approached by Acas and are happy to talk.”</p>
      <p>The company states it has offered to keep a guard on every train as part of a framework agreement and accused the union of a “misguided attempt to hold power over the industry”.</p>
      <p>Mick Cash, the RMT’s general secretary, said: “We enter into these talks in good faith as always, and the trade union will not be providing a running commentary.”</p>
