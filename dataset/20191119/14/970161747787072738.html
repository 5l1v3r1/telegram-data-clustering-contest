      <p>The president of the Oxford Union is facing impeachment proceedings after a blind student was filmed being dragged from his seat by security.</p>
      <p>PhD student Ebenezer Azamati, 25, was seen visibly distressed as he tried to resist being pulled out of the debating chamber.</p>
      <p>Instead of giving an apology, President Brendan McGrath called a disciplinary hearing against him, where it was claimed that Mr Azamati had ‘behaved violently’ by thrusting an arm out and making aggressive hand gestures as he was being removed from the building.</p>
      <p>He was suspended from the union for two terms – although this has now been reversed.</p>
      <p>Footage of the initial incident has gone viral, sparking a global outcry, including condemnation from Oxford University who said they ‘share the widespread outrage’.</p>
      <p>Students at the union have now lodged a motion calling for the impeachment of McGrath. If 150 Union members sign it within 48 hours, it will be put to a vote.</p>

      <p>McGrath, an alumnus of exclusive private Sevenoaks School, would then be forced to stand down if more there was a majority of over two thirds.</p>

      <p>Over 5,000 people have signed <a href="https://www.change.org/p/the-oxford-union-justice-for-azamati-oxfordunionexclusion?recruiter=false&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&amp;recruited_by_id=e686ee40-0969-11ea-8b37-3703c7ad6e2f">a petition</a> calling for his resignation, as well as for compensation for Mr Azamati.</p>
      <p>The Oxford University Africa Society said: ‘The Oxford Union, in particular the President, has completely failed in its responsibility towards its members.</p>
      <p>‘We are therefore calling on all members to impeach the President.’</p>
      <p>During the incident on October 17, PhD student Mr Azamati, 25, had arrived early to reserve an accessible seat by putting a book on it, then left to have dinner.</p>
      <p>When he returned and sat down, security attempted to remove him, apparently by grabbing his ankles.</p>

      <p>Mr Azamati, a student of St John’s College from Ghana, had life membership of the Union and wanted to hear the debate ‘This House has no confidence in HM Government’.</p>
      <p>Oxford University said in a statement: ‘We share the widespread outrage regarding the unacceptable treatment of Ebenezer Azamati, a member of our University community, at the Oxford Union. Ebenezer’s college and the University are working to fully support him.</p>
      <p>‘The Union is an entirely independent club not governed by the University, but this student’s treatment goes against our culture of inclusivity and tolerance – we are pressing the Union for answers on how they plan to remedy the issue and ensure this does not happen in future.’</p>
      <p>McGrath has been contacted for comment.</p>
