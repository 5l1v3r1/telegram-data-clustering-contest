      <h1>Caroline Spiegel, the sister of Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, is taking on sites like PornHub with the launch of her new audio porn site, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>

        <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/snap">Snap</a> CEO <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/evan-spiegel">Evan Spiegel</a> has a sister named Caroline who is also in the tech industry.</li>
        <li>Caroline Spiegel launched a startup earlier this year called <a href="https://tryquinn.com/">Quinn</a>, a “much less gross, more fun PornHub for women,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/quinn-porn-caroline-spiegel/">she told TechCrunch in March</a>.</li>
        <li>However, Quinn has since rebranded after discovering that more than just women were enjoying the site’s audio and written porn, but “they just hadn’t felt they could ask for it.”</li>

      <p>There’s a new startup that’s entered the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/27/race-to-build-world-first-sex-robot">$30 billion sex-tech industry</a>, and the last name of its founder isn’t entirely unfamiliar to Silicon Valley.</p>
      <p>Caroline Spiegel is the younger sister of Snap CEO Evan Spiegel. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/quinn-porn-caroline-spiegel/">was first reported in March</a> that Caroline Spiegel, as a 22-year-old Stanford University senior studying computer science, was launching a website home to free audio- and text-based porn, and devoid of visual content.</p>
      <p>The younger Spiegel has since continued in her older brother’s footsteps, becoming the second Spiegel sibling to drop out of Stanford their senior year to follow their startup dreams.</p>
      <p>The startup, called <a href="https://tryquinn.com/">Quinn</a>, officially launched its website this month after its beta went live back in April. Quinn is intended to be an alternative to the plethora of porn that is image-heavy and made with the male gaze in mind, Caroline Spiegel told TechCrunch in March.</p>
      <p>While Spiegel initially described Quinn to TechCrunch as “a much less gross, more fun PornHub for women,” Quinn has since rebranded to cater to “all genders and sexual identities.”</p>
      <p>“Quinn learned that it wasn’t just women who were enjoying the content on Quinn,” the company said this month in a press release. “Everyone was looking was a more all-around pleasurable masturbation experience too – they just hadn’t felt they could ask for it.”</p>
      <p>Spiegel told TechCrunch that the idea for Quinn stemmed from the stigma surrounding female masturbation and pleasure, resulting in a dearth of female-centric sexual products and content. In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16418125">a 2005 study</a>, only 39% of cisgender women said they “usually” or “always” orgasm during straight sex.</p>
      <p>But more recently, there’s been an influx of sex-tech companies geared toward women. Companies such as <a href="https://unboundbabes.com/">Unbound</a> and <a href="https://www.dameproducts.com/">Dame</a> sell sex products for female pleasure.</p>
      <p>Perhaps Quinn’s biggest competition is <a href="https://www.dipseastories.com/">Dipsea</a>, an audio-porn startup valued at $17 million, according to PitchBook. Spiegel said that while she considers Dipsea a competitor, Quinn “sway[s] a little more erotic than they do.”</p>
      <p>Quinn has already raised nearly $1 million, TechCrunch reported. Spiegel said none of the funding came from her brother, but he’s been “very supportive” of the startup.</p>
      <p>The Quinn CEO has since moved from Los Angeles to the East Coast, and now lives in Brooklyn. Quinn has brought on two additional execs, a chief operations officer and a head of content, both of whom attended Stanford alongside Spiegel.</p>
