      <h2>RUNNING a marathon is challenging enough, but one Island fundraiser decided to step things up a gear and tow a car along with him...</h2>

      <p>Peter Wright pulled the Smart car – which weighs over a tonne – up and down the Five Mile Road more than five times for a total of 26.2 miles at the weekend in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support Jersey. It took a total of about 13 hours to complete.</p>
      <p>The challenge is part of a host of feats the 46-year-old has completed since the start of last year, including a 230km ultra-marathon across Swedish Lapland, a 24-hour cycle challenge and various other ultra-marathons. To date he has raised about £4,700 for the charity, which supports cancer sufferers and their loved ones.</p>
      <p>Mr Wright, the chief operating officer for technology consultancy firm Prosperity 24/7, said the challenges were tougher physically and mentally than he had imagined.</p>
      <p>‘It was like being put in a medieval torture device. I have to say after I had done the first up and down I did question whether or not I could complete it,’ said Mr Wright, who is raising money for Macmillan, as several members of his family have been supported by their services.</p>
      <p>‘Luckily the body got used to it and I got there,’ he added.</p>
      <p>The Islander started at 6am and dragged the vehicle between Le Braye and Jersey Pearl before finishing outside Sands.</p>
      <p>The event was jointly sponsored by Jacksons and DGR Slatter Decorators. Tickets for a raffle with a prize of a VW Up car, donated by Jacksons, are currently for sale from Macmillan’s The Lounge café in Burrard Street. The draw is due to be held next month.</p>
      <p>Asked what challenges were next on Mr Wright’s list, he said: ‘I am planning to do the Channel swim next year. I can swim but I need to put some more weight on but all my focus is on that to do it next August.</p>
      <p>‘All this [the fundraising] started as a bit of a mid-life crisis, so I will see how long I keep going. It feels good at the moment.’</p>
      <p>Mr Wright also thanked his personal trainer, Dan Garrido from FX fitness, who has trained the fundraiser free of charge. He thanked his nutritionist, Kit Chamier, his physiotherapist, Lisa Mann, and his sports masseuse, Helen Papworth, too.</p>
