      <p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles star Alan Ritchson branded his time on the film ‘the worst production experience’ he’s ever had, in a scathing attack.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old went so far as to say he ‘hated life so much’ while shooting for the reboot – alongside Will Arnett and Megan Fox – back in 2014.</p>
      <p>Despite the first film bringing in nearly $500million (£386m) the actor – who played Raphael – explained he actually turned it down at first, describing the project as a ‘waste of the best years’ of his career.</p>
      <p>‘It made me hate life so much, so much’ he admitted. ‘They were so bad to us and they broke so many promises.</p>
      <p>‘I said no, I didn’t want to do it because I’m going to waste the best years of my career on something that nobody’s even going to know that I’m a part of.’</p>
      <p>He claimed Paramount was the driving force behind him signing on, with producers promising he would more than just a ‘guy in a mask’, and that he would be seen and known around the world.</p>

      <p>However, none of this materialised.</p>

      <p>‘They’re like, “No, no, this is a whole new, live-action, one-to-one, you move, they move, you’re just as much a part of this as anybody else,’ he continued to Collider Live!</p>
      <p>‘When it comes time to get you out there, you’re going to be in every country in the world, premieres all over the place, we’re really going to get you out there.”</p>
      <p>‘It was like, all right, obviously that always helps, getting to know other audiences in other countries internationally and I had a young boy at the time. I really wanted to do this for [him].</p>
      <p>‘They were pointing to the guy in Lord of the Rings [Andy Serkis] and what it did for him.</p>
      <p>‘Not only would they refuse to allow us to talk to the press to talk to people, we found out after the fact that they told people we were refusing interviews, which isn’t true.’</p>

      <p>Alan also alleged that Megan and will were ‘treated so differently’ because of their ‘riders’, which made things ‘rough’.</p>
      <p>He was due to star in a third movie alongside his fellow Turtles – Pete Ploszek (voiced by Johnny Knoxville), Jeremy Howard and Noel Fisher – which was later cancelled after the second instalment flopped at the box office.</p>

      <p>But the Hunger Games actor revealed the experience did teach him to ensure people are treated with ‘respect’ on sets.</p>
      <p>‘When I produce things now, I treat people with the respect than I want to be treated with, that I didn’t get on some of these projects,’ he added.</p>
