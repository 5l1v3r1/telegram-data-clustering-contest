      <p>Google Cloud will set up and manage the department’s data management system to ensure it becomes a so-called cloud-first organisation by June next year.</p>
      <p>It comes after recent criticism that government departments relied too heavily on Amazon to provide digital services.</p>
      <p>This has been touted by some as a potential security risk.</p>
      <p>The government introduced measures to allow smaller companies to have a better chance at winning government contracts last year, however several Whitehall contracts have been awarded to AWS since then.</p>
      <p>The announcement to award the DfT contract to Google Cloud was two years in the making, according to the department’s chief investment officer Mark Lyons.</p>
      <p>“The capabilities the platform offers are helping us to utilise data better to support decision-making, policy-making, reporting and governance, as well as provide new digital services to engage with citizens on transport related initiatives,” he said.</p>

      <p>“When you have finite resources, having a partner that understands the process of change and can direct your focus to the things that really matter is invaluable.”</p>
      <p>The foundations of DfT’s new cloud system has allowed for improvement in journey time estimates and ticket information searches.</p>
      <p>Mark Palmer, Google Cloud’s head of public sector for the UK, said: “Since the migration, DfT has been able to access a broad range of services designed to dramatically enhance its capabilities, as well as develop its own software products on top of Google Cloud.”</p>
