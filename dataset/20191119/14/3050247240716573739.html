      <h1>FEMA Suggests Blockchain-Based Registry to Improve Disaster Insurance Payouts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:20:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:20</time> by <a rel="author">Ana Alexandre</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-sec-takes-another-look-at-rejected-bitwise-bitcoin-etf-proposal">United States</a> Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is exploring the idea of a blockchain-based property registry to streamline disaster insurance payouts.</p>
      <p>In its latest <a href="https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1572880188002-31454e3c26dff6922fde9d34cbe19e26/November_2019_NAC_Report_Draft_v5.pdf">National Advisory Draft Report to the FEMA Administrator</a>, the agency indicated its interest in deploying <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-state-media-says-most-blockchain-firms-in-china-are-all-hype-no-code">blockchain</a> technology in order to streamline disaster insurance payouts and improve the speed of disaster responses. </p>
      <p>To achieve this, FEMA recommended the establishment of a blockchain-based property and land registry, containing all critical information needed to file an insurance or disaster assistance claim.</p>
      <h3>Cutting the rate of self-insurance for public infrastructure</h3>
      <p>FEMA suggested that such a registry would not only promote liquidation of an insurance policy such as a “disaster dividend” or a “harm’s way” claim but also reduce the rate of self-insurance for public infrastructure. According to FEMA, self-insurance most often means no insurance at all, which makes the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/venezuela-to-pay-retirees-and-pensioners-christmas-bonus-in-petro">government</a> bear the expenses on unfunded disasters.</p>
      <p>In the report, FEMA noted blockchain and other emerging technologies’ ability to improve resilience and recovery efforts in a disaster, as critical data can be stored off-site in a “highly-trusted, secure platform.”</p>
      <h3>Adoption of blockchain in the insurance industry</h3>
      <p>There are a number of examples of the successful implementation of blockchain technology in the insurance industry globally. Recently, the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/public-statement-aims-to-define-legal-status-of-crypto-assets-in-the-uk">United Kingdom</a>-based charity organization Oxfam International <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/oxfams-blockchain-based-agricultural-insurance-pays-farmers-in-sri-lanka">announced</a> the success of its blockchain-based delivery system of microinsurance to paddy field farmers in Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p>The company claimed that blockchain could transform and simplify the insurance claims process, which would result in reduced administration costs and a higher percentage of premiums being used for fully trusted pay-outs.</p>
      <p>In April, the British Virgin Islands <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/british-virgin-islands-blockchain-firm-develop-crypto-payments-system-for-emergency-aid">partnered</a> with blockchain firm Lifelabs.io to launch an alternative crypto-enabled payment infrastructure for residents across the chain of islands. The partnership had a particular focus on using crypto infrastructure to support the reliable and swift transfer of aid and access to funds in emergency scenarios.</p>
