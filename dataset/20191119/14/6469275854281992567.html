      <p>He was released on licence in July but later arrested and charged with another burglary in Preston on November 13.</p>
      <p>Bosanko was remanded to appear at Preston Magistrates' Court on the same day, where he was bailed.</p>

      <p>The 39-year-old is described as white, around 6ft, of stocky build with short, receding, dark-brown hair and brown eyes.</p>
