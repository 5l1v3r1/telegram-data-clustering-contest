      <h1>Akon To Run For President In 2024 â€“ He Wants Kanye West To Run As Well</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:09:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:09</time> by <a rel="author">Alexis Stone</a></address>
      <p>Akon seems to be considering the idea of running for president in 2024. He recently addressed the subject on The Real, and he brought up <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/kanye-west-shares-his-testimony-at-joel-osteens-lakewood-church-how-to-watch-live-sunday-service-streaming-online-341933/">Kanye West</a> as well.</p>
      <p>The Shade Room has more details on the issue, and you can check them out below.</p>
      <p>TSR reported that Akon was a guest on the latest episode of The Real, and during his interview, itâ€™s been mentioned the fact that he was once ready to run for president in 2020.</p>
      <p>â€˜However, all bets were off after he realized he wouldnâ€™t be able to do his music. However, now that heâ€™s doing his music one last time, it looks like he could possibly run in 2024,â€™ TSR writes.</p>
      <p>TSR cited Akon as saying the following: â€˜I know what the issues are, and as a person, as an immigrant, as a black man, as whatever you want to call it. I kind of know or feel like I know that I can take the country and move it forward.â€™</p>
      <p>He then went on to talk about how he is currently advising 30 African presidents, and how it is based on the development of the youth.</p>

      <p>Kanye West was also mentioned and Akon was asked whether he sees Kim Kardashianâ€™s hubby as a potential threat.</p>
      <p>He responded that there would not be such a thing as competition between them.</p>
      <p>Someone said: â€˜Thatâ€™s a hard noâ€¦..bro got a whole song about being locked up and not able to come out ðŸ’€ðŸ˜‚â€™</p>
      <p>Another commenter posted this: â€˜What he does for Africa is amazing but I think America politics are too much for him.â€™</p>
      <p>One follower wrote: â€˜Akon has done sooooo much for Africa !!! And Iâ€™m sure he will do the same for America !!! He has my vote.â€™</p>
      <p>Someone else said: â€˜Now if Akon ran I would probably vote for him, I see what he does for Africa and stuff, but Kanye ðŸ˜—â€™</p>
      <p>Would you vote for Akon?</p>
