      <p>A family’s beloved Yorkshire terrier died bloodied and in pain after a delivery driver allegedly threw a package that landed on top of her.</p>
      <p>Cooper the dog was sunbathing in the back of her home in Venice, Los Angeles, last week when a FedEx driver pulled up outside.</p>
      <p>That driver is said to have tossed a large box filled with crystal over the fence, only for it to land on Cooper and fatally damage her lungs and liver.</p>
      <p>Mitchell Galin, who owned Cooper, told <a href="https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2019/11/18/exclusive-family-blames-fedex-delivery-driver-for-death-of-beloved-dog/">CBSLA</a>: ‘So I immediately picked up the box, and Cooper was in a puddle of blood.’</p>
      <p>He and partner Keiko Napier rushed Cooper to a vet, where they were told that the four-pound dog would have to be put to sleep.</p>

      <p>Galin, who said Cooper had helped soothe him to sleep, said: ‘It was painful to watch your dog in pain.’</p>

      <p>And Napier told of the agony the ordeal had caused, saying: ‘We’ve just had a horrible weekend.’</p>
      <p>FedEx issued a statement extending its ‘deepest sympathies’ to Galin and Napier.</p>
      <p>Their fence is so tall it is unlikely that the driver would have seen Cooper laying on the other side.</p>
      <p>The courier giant said it had launched an urgent investigation into Cooper’s death, and would ‘take appropriate action’ once it had concluded.</p>

      <p>But Napier has now called for a company wide rule banning couriers from throwing packages.</p>
      <p>He explained: ‘To me that’s not satisfactory.</p>
      <p>‘I feel they need to say they’re going to institute a corporate-wide mandate that drivers cannot throw packages; that’s what I want to hear.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t want to hear we’ll look into it.”</p>
      <p>The couple said Cooper used to sleep between them at night, and said they want to prevent drivers from taking shortcuts that could have a lasting impact.</p>
      <p>“Our grandchild pays out here.</p>
      <p>‘My mother is out here gardening. I’m here gardening.</p>
      <p>‘And the package was so heavy, should it have struck one of us, it would’ve caused damage — very very severe damage.’</p>
