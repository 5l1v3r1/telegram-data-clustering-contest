      <h1>S&amp;P 500 Valuation And The Potential For A Correction</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:03:38+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Gilmartin, CFA</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In a year where the S&amp;P 500 will likely finish up 25% or so, a 6% correction (the amount Bespoke thinks the S&amp;P 500 is overvalued), or a market flush like Samantha LaDuc is looking for might be just what the doctor ordered in terms of flushing out the latest surge in bullish sentiment.</li>
        <li>It's still a long way from the type of secular bear market we saw in 2001-2002 and then again in 2008.</li>
        <li>One of the interesting aspects to me the last few years is how quickly sentiment changes.</li>

      <p>Each quarter Dr. David Kelly, the Chief Global Strategist for JPMorgan, and his team publish the "Guide to the Market" (GTTM) which is 70-75 pages chock full of some of the best capital market, economic and Federal Reserve data you can find in one place. Dr. Kelly holds a conference call the first day or two of each quarter and runs through what he thinks is important in "the Guide".</p>
      <p>This graph/chart/table has always caught my eye since it provides great longer-term perspective on the S&amp;P 500's valuation. (See first chart aboveâ€¦)</p>

      <p>Tracking the S&amp;P 500 valuation page chronologically provides some perspective on the valuation changes over shorter periods of time.</p>
      <p>The fact is the data hasn't really varied much over the last 2-3 years. The EY-BAA yield spread looks undervalued.</p>
      <p>The GGTM is one of the few places investors can get the S&amp;P 500 "cash-flow valuation", and if you track it on the spreadsheet, it shows the S&amp;P 500 a little overvalued relative to historical ranges, but certainly not alarmingly so. I'd love to see that metric as of March 2000.</p>
      <p>By the way, the GGTM was published on 9/30/19, and at that time, the S&amp;P 500 closed the quarter at 2,976.74, while the Nasdaq closed the quarter at 7,999.34.</p>

          <b>So what's the odds of an S&amp;P 500 correction at present?</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>Bespoke thinks that the S&amp;P 500 is about 6% overvalued, and suggests a 9%-10% return for the S&amp;P 500 over the next year, about where a forecaster said it might be in <a href="http://fundamentalis.com/?p=9484">last week's blog post</a>.</p>

      <h3>Summary/conclusion:</h3>
      <p>In a year where the S&amp;P 500 will likely finish up 25% or so, a 6% correction (the amount Bespoke thinks the S&amp;P 500 is overvalued), or a market flush like Samantha LaDuc is looking for might be just what the doctor ordered in terms of flushing out the latest surge in bullish sentiment.</p>
      <p>It's still a long way from the type of secular bear market we saw in 2001-2002 and then again in 2008.</p>
      <p>One of the interesting aspects to me the last few years is how quickly sentiment changes: I can practically guarantee you that if we get a 3% in the S&amp;P 500, sentiment will turn south quickly and within a few weeks, bears will be near highs again. It's happened numerous times since 2008.</p>
      <p>Remember this is just an opinion. Draw your own conclusions and understand your own emotional makeup.</p>
