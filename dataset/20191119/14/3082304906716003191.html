      <p>The Philippine national football teams for men and women will both be keen on fielding in strong lineups as they try to have a better showing in their previous campaign. Both of the said teams have failed to make it past the group stages in the 2017 edition of the biennial meet.</p>

      <p>Both the Azkals and the Malditas have earned the luck of the draw for the upcoming SEA Games. The Azkals are bunched alongside Timor Leste, Myanmar, Cambodia, and 2017 runner-ups Malaysia in Group B.</p>
      <p>Group A, on the other hand, will be composed of Vietnam, Laos, Brunei, Singapore, bronze medalist Indonesia, and defending champions Thailand.</p>
