      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/tyra-banks/">Tyra Banks</a> recently shared several Instagram posts with her eager followers, in which she documented the same outfit that she wore to the American Influencer Awards.</p>
      <p>In the most recent snap she posted, Tyra revealed the scandalous outfit that showcased her insane body. She opted to wear a coat with statement shoulders and an eye-catching black, white, and gray graphic print. Though her bottom half was cropped out of the snap, another photo showed that she rocked the knee-length coat with a pair of high-waisted pants in the same bold print.</p>
      <p>Rather than wearing a blouse or t-shirt underneath the coat, Tyra finished off the ensemble with just a black lace bra. The bra had black cups that flaunted Tyra’s curves, and a lace overlay that added a delicate touch and accentuated her cleavage. She kept the accessories simple, adding a pair of black leather fingerless gloves and nothing else. Given how bold her outfit was, she opted to not add too many accessories to distract from the look.</p>
      <p>Tyra’s beauty look was flawless, and she incorporated bronze and brown shades that made her eyes pop. A masterfully applied combination of bronzer and highlighter sculpted her cheekbones, and she rocked a nude lip that allowed her eye makeup to be the main focus. Tyra pulled her hair back into a high ponytail that was teased to add a bit of extra volume, and she snapped the shots outside.</p>
