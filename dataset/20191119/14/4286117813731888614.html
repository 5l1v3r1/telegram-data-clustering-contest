      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>India are set to play their maiden pink ball Test against Bangladesh</li>
        <li>Australia made history at the Adelaide Oval when they hosted New Zealand in the first ever pink-ball Test</li>
        <li>New Zealand, West Indies, South Africa and Zimbabwe lost their inaugural Day-night Tests</li>
      </ul>
      <p>India won the first Test against Bangladesh in resounding fashion and are now a couple of days away from becoming the latest entrant of the club where 8 of the 12 Test-playing nations have already had their share of pink.</p>
      <p>After the ICC introduced the concept of Day-night Tests in a bid to improve the popularity of the longest form of the game, Australia made history at the Adelaide Oval when they hosted New Zealand in the first ever pink-ball Test in November 2015.</p>
      <p>Australia, Pakistan, England and Sri Lanka returned victorious in their first stint with the pink ball whereas New Zealand, West Indies, South Africa and Zimbabwe lost their inaugural Day-night Tests.</p>
      <p>
        <b>First Pink ball Test, November 27-29, 2015: Australia vs New Zealand</b>
      </p>
      <p>Batting first, New Zealand were bundled out for 202 in the 66th over with four Australian pacers taking all 10 wickets. Steve Smith and Peter Neville's hard fought half-centuries ensured that the hosts held a 22-run first-innings advantage in the maiden pink ball Test. In the second innings New Zealand's top-order again failed to fire and the visitors were bowled out for 208 setting Australia 187 to win. David Warner then blasted 35 from 37 balls to get his team off to a perfect start before Shaun Marsh (49) ensured the hosts won the inaugural day-night Test.</p>
      <p>Brief scores: Australia (224 and 187 for 7 declared) beat New Zealand (202 and 208) by 3 wickets</p>

        <b>Second Pink ball Test, October 13-17, 2016: Pakistan vs West Indies</b>
      </p>
      <p>In stark contrast to the Adelaide Day-night Test, batting appeared very simple with the pink ball in Dubai. Azhar Ali smashed a triple century as the hosts scored 579/3(dec) from 155.3 overs. Then West Indies posted 357, thanks largely to half-centuries from Darren Bravo and Marlon Samuels. Surprisingly, Pakistan were dismissed for a miserly 123 in the second innings owing to leg-spinning exploits of Devendra Bishoo, who took eight wickets. Set 343 to win, West Indies fell 54 runs short.</p>
      <p>Brief scores: Pakistan (579 for 3 declared and 123) beat West Indies (357 and 289) by 56 runs</p>
      <p>
        <b>Third Pink ball Test, November 24-27, 2016: Australia vs South Africa</b>
      </p>
      <p>Adelaide hosted its second day-night Test, with South Africa playing their maiden Test under lights. Faf du Plessis made an unbeaten century after winning the toss but Australia restricted the visitors to 9-259 before South Africa declared to hand the hosts 12 overs under lights. A patient century from stand-in opener Usman Khawaja, and half-centuries to Smith, Peter Handscomb and Starc ensured the hosts took a big lead into the second innings. Australia required 127 runs to win the match and the hosts reached the total with seven wickets in hand.</p>
      <p>Brief scores: Australia (383 and 127/3) beat South Africa (259 for 9 declared and 250 ) by 7 wickets</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fifth Pink ball Test, August 17-19, 2016: England vs West Indies</b>
      </p>
      <p>Batting first, England posted a mammoth 514-8 declared, with Alastair Cook scoring 243 and skipper Joe Root also pitching in with a well-made 136. West Indies could manage only 168 in reply and when they were asked to follow on they fared worse, getting bundled out for 137. England's maiden pink ball Test ended with a comprehensive win over a hapless West Indies, who struggled to come to terms with the hosts' pace attack.</p>
      <p>Brief scores: England (514 for 8 declared) beat West Indies (168 and 137) by an innings and 209 runs</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sixth Pink ball Test, October 6-10, 2017: Sri Lanka vs Pakistan</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dubai hosted its second day-night Test, with Sri Lanka playing their maiden pink ball Test. Sri Lanka made 482 before dismissing Pakistan for 262. The visitors seemed favourites at this point yet Pakistan fought back, dismissing Sri Lanka for just 98 in the second innings. That left them needing 317 to win. Despite an Asad Shafiq ton and a half-century from Sarfaraz Ahmed, a lack of contributions from elsewhere saw them bundled out for 248.</p>
      <p>Brief scores: Sri Lanka (482 and 96) beat Pakistan (262 and 248) by 68 runs</p>
      <p>
        <b>Eighth Pink ball Test, December 26-27, 2017: South Africa vs Zimbabwe</b>
      </p>
      <p>South Africa wrapped up a historic four-day Test in two days with their first pink-ball victory coming against minnows Zimbabwe. Aiden Markram's century put South Africa in control as the hosts posted 309-9 before declaring in the first innings. Zimbabwe could only manage 68 in the first innings - with only two players registering double-digit scores. They didn't fare much better in the second innings, scoring 121 when asked to follow-on.</p>
      <p>Brief scores: South Africa (309 for 9 declared) beat Zimbabwe (68 and 121) by an innings and 120 runs</p>
