      <p>A man recently arrested in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe">Malta</a> after he claimed to know the identity of the mastermind who ordered the car-bombing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/crime">murder</a> of anti-corruption journalist <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/murdered-reporter-daphne-caruana-galizia-made-many-enemies">Daphne Caruana Galizia</a> in October 2017 was offered a presidential pardon, Maltese officials said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Joseph Muscat confirmed he made the offer on the condition that the man’s information about the assassination could be corroborated with evidence in court.</p>

      <p>The man, who remains under police protection and has yet to be officially named, was arrested Thursday in a separate money-laundering case. He is alleged to have acted as a middleman between whoever ordered the death of Caruana Galizia and those who carried it out.</p>

      <p>The man negotiated for the pardon to include his involvement in past crimes after telling investigators he feared for his safety if he were to be sentenced to prison, the <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/daphne-murder-middleman-seeks-pardon-to-name-mastermind.750880">Times of Malta</a> reported.</p>
      <p>His arrest is the latest development in the case. Three other men were <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/malta-arrests-several-in-car-bombing-of-investigative-journalist-daphne-caruana-galizia">arrested in December 2017</a> on suspicion of triggering the blast that killed Caruana Galizia. They are still awaiting trial.</p>
