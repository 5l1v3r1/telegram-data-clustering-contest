      <p>Expect a slight increase in price after the engine is updated to BS6 emission norms; 334cc BS6 motor to remain exclusive to the higher-spec Perak sibling.</p>
      <p>Jawa Motorcycles India has announced that their Jawa and Forty Two models will continue to be powered by a motor of the same 293cc capacity, even after the BS6 emission norms kick in from April 2020 onwards. Presently, these engines are compliant with the current BS4 emission norms and will be updated in due time. Jawa released this statement after misleading rumours online suggesting that the company was planning to upgrade the above models with the newly launched Jawa Perak’s 334cc, BS6-ready engine.</p>
      <p>The Jawa and Forty Two sit below the new Perak which was launched last week – a bobber style motorcycle that uses a bored-out version of the 293cc engine producing a higher 30hp and 31Nm of torque.<b> <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-news/jawa-perak-launched-at-rs-195-lakh-414931">The motorcycle was launched at 1.95 lakh </a></b>(ex-showroom, Delhi) which is approximately Rs 30,000 over the Jawa and Forty Two.</p>
      <p>Given the fact that the BS6 norms are upon us it was prudent of Jawa to introduce the Perak bobber with a BS6-compliant motor. Also, the bigger engine is one of the distinguishing elements that separate the Perak from the bike maker's lower-spec models; and it would make no sense to introduce it in the Forty Two and Jawa.</p>
      <p>The Jawa and Forty Two's current BS4-compliant 293cc motor produces 27hp and 28Nm of torque. We expect a small hike in the price of the two models following the upgrade of their engine to BS6 emission norms.</p>
