      <h2>The next milestone of the £15 million Stafford Western Access Route work will begin on Friday, two weeks later than planned.</h2>

      <p>A new temporary roundabout will open on Doxey Road which will provide access to the Sainsbury's and borough council car park until the realigned permanent roundabout opens.</p>
      <p>It was originally set to come into use on November 8, but due to the weather it has been delayed until tomorrow. And Staffordshire County Council has said it will not delay the overall scheme.</p>
      <p>Work on the route began in the summer and when completed will link the A34 Foregate Street at Madford Retail Park to the A518 Newport Road Castlefields junction.</p>
      <p>It will help improve traffic flow in Gaol Square, Newport Road (east of Kingsway), Station Road, Chell Road, A34 Foregate Street (south of the scheme) and Doxey Road, the council says.</p>
      <p>Piling work is continuing off Doxey Road where the new section of road will be built.</p>
      <p>Demolition of the old Saint Gobain buildings on Doxey Road will begin imminently, paving the way for a new roundabout and future development.</p>
      <p>Staffordshire County Council’s head of highways James Bailey said: “The Stafford Western Access Route scheme is progressing well and will see the temporary roundabout access opening this week. Demolition work is also starting on the old Saint Gobain buildings on Doxey Road.</p>
      <p>“We want to make people aware of the new car park access to the east of the current roundabout. This will be in operation until the new permanent roundabout has been completed.”</p>
      <p>Anyone wanting further information about the Stafford Western Access Route can email staffordwestern.accessroute@staffordshire.gov.uk</p>
      <p>The scheme will include improved conditions for bus services, pedestrians and cyclists. There will also be environmental benefits through the redevelopment of areas of derelict land and landscaping along the route.</p>
      <p>The road is being funded by developers and with £15.5million secured by the Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire Enterprise Partnership through the Government’s Local Growth Fund.</p>
