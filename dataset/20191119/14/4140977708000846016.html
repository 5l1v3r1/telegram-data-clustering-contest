          </p>
          <p>When the ongoing edition of the Women’s Big Bash League got underway, no one had anticipated that Melbourne esters will be entrapped in the impasse they find themselves in at the moment. The side have been persistently shrouded in a scuffle with the team facing massive backlash and flak for their gaffe performers, ones which have seen them be slumped since entirety in the bottom of the points tally.</p>
          <p>It not just the position which the outfit occupy but rather the fact that they have managed to string together just the lone win in nine encounters which augurs towards how abject and appalling the side have been as a unit. They have been ripped into and trounced by their opponents, something which was alluded to in their previous match as well. </p>

                <p>Caught in a tussle in the last encounter, the side put in a howler of a batting display as they were sent back to the pavilion for just 96 to see them be put down in what was a runaway 57 run win for Adelaide Strikers. Up against a side who have been routed across their stay in the league, Perth Scorchers will be looking to use their encounter to spruce up their bid for moving into the pinnacles of the league standings.</p>
                <p>The Scorchers currently find themselves in fifth place with the five wins and four defeats form nice matches with one of those defeats coming in the last contest to league leaders Brisbane. The side managed to put on a sorry 112, a target which was never going to perturb the first placed side who ended up cruising to a 7 wicket win.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>Although this has usually been a good wicket for the batters, as the league has traversed by, the slower bowlers have started thriving over here. And with this being the second encounter of the day to be played on this track, the spinners will flourish and get the ball to turn.</p>
                      <p>However, despite that narrative, the surface will not regress as the match goes on, leading the side winning the toss opting to come out and field first on the surface.</p>

                            <h3>PS-W vs MS-W Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Her side’s opener Amy Jones has been a pivotal and quintessential player for Perth Scorchers this edition of the T20 league. The wicket-keeper has yet again shown why she’s held in such reverence, capping off her outings in the middle with some stellar displays with the bat to make her an instant choice for today’s clash.</p>
                            <h3>PS-W vs MS-W Dream11 Batswomen</h3>
                            <p>She finds company in the form of her counterpart Meg Lanning, another consistent and flawless bat at the top of the order for her side. The two have together complimented and assisted each other perfectly, keeping the strike moving persistently while revelling in the boundaries consistently as well to make full use of the field restrictions they come out to bat in.</p>
                            <p>From the opposition meanwhile we are going in with both the South Africans for this encounter, beginning with opener Lizelle Lee. At a time when nothing has gone her side’s way, she and Preez have in unison encapsulated ther ability to hit the ball n the sweet spot and crunch the ball to the fence to pile on some respectable scores in an otherwise dwindling batting order.</p>
                            <h3>PS-W vs MS-W Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Her 26 runs the last time around along with the one wicket in her kitty as well see us move in fro Natalie Sciver without any hesitations from Perth Scorchers. The player is a testament of what we desire from an all-rounder, someone who has doled out impeccable performances in both the dockets of the game to become such a stellar performer.</p>
                            <p>Kim Garth is also brought in from the outfit while from the other side of the docket we are venturing in with Erin Osborne and Madeline Penna, two players whose roles with both the bat and ball make them two extremely viable options for this forthcoming contest.</p>
                            <h3>PS-W vs MS-W Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Both Taneale Peschel and Jemma Barsby returned wicketless the last time around but up against a massively weaker and inferior batting unit, the duo from Perth Scorchers will relish their opportunity of sending down the overs today. They are up against a tepid and tentative batting unit, one prone to falling infront of vicious and judicious bowling which should see this duo fill in their kitty come today’s contest.</p>
                            <p>Elsewhere, from the other side we are reposing faith in Nicola Hancock after she gave away just 19 runs in three matches in the foregone contest at a time when the rest of her bowling unit were being ripped into.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>We have selected Sciver to captain our side for this impending contest whilst Jones will be our captain.</p>
