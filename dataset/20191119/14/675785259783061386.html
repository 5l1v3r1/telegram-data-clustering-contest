      <h2>Researchers from Checkmarx Security Research have discovered a bug that could allow hackers to control your smartphone camera and take photos or record videos</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:47:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:47</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>A new bug in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/android">Android</a> smartphones has been discovered that could let hackers spy on you through your smartphone camera.</p>
      <p>The bug, dubbed CVE-2019-2234, was discovered by the Checkmarx Security Research Team.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.checkmarx.com/blog/how-attackers-could-hijack-your-android-camera">blog</a> about the findings, researcher Erez Yalon wrote: “Having a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a> Pixel 2 XL and Pixel 3 on-hand, our team began researching the Google Camera app, ultimately finding multiple concerning vulnerabilities stemming from permission bypass issues.</p>
      <p>“After further digging, we also found that these same vulnerabilities impact the camera apps of other smartphone vendors in the Android ecosystem – namely Samsung – presenting significant implications to hundreds-of-millions of smartphone users.”</p>
      <p>Worryingly, the bug could allow hackers to control the Google Camera or Samsung Camera apps and take photos or record videos of the user, according to the researchers.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the researchers found that certain attack scenarios could allow hackers to access stored videos and photos, as well as GPS metadata associated with them.</p>
      <p>Mr Yalon added: “Our researchers determined a way to enable a rogue application to force the camera apps to take photos and record video, even if the phone is locked or the screen is turned off.</p>
      <p>“Our researchers could do the same even when a user was is in the middle of a voice call.”</p>
      <p>Following their discovery, the researchers reported the bug to Google, who discovered that the issue affected all Android smartphones, and not just Google Pixel devices.</p>
      <p>Google said: “We appreciate Checkmarx bringing this to our attention and working with Google and Android partners to coordinate disclosure.</p>
      <p>“The issue was addressed on impacted Google devices via a Play Store update to the Google Camera Application in July 2019. A patch has also been made available to all partners.”</p>
