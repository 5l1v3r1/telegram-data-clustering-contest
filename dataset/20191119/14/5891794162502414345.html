      <p>On November 30, 1939, nearly half a million Soviet troops stormed into Finland, beginning what would become known as the Winter War. The surprise attack came after the Kremlin, fearing a possible Nazi offensive through Finland, had insistently called for a land swap that would have pushed the Finnish border away from Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). Wary of Soviet intentions, Finland’s government refused.</p>
      <p>Soviet planners assumed an easy victory in time for Josef Stalin's 60th birthday on December 21. It was not to be.</p>
      <p>Although the Red Army would eventually win the war, the defeat of the country of just 3.7 million people came only months later -- and at a terrible cost.</p>

        <figcaption>One cheap anti-tank weapon the Finns devised were Molotov cocktails (pictured) made of gasoline and tar.</figcaption>

      <p>Showing their dark sense of humor, the fighters named the firebombs after the Soviet foreign minister as a "drink to go with the food" that Molotov had claimed to be dropping on Finland. Thus giving birth to an oft-used weapon in conflicts through the decades since.</p>

      <p>Professional farmer and hunter Simo Hayha reportedly killed more than 500 Soviet soldiers during the Winter War, before he was shot in the face and badly wounded by a Soviet sharpshooter. Late in life, when asked if he regretted killing so many young men, he responded, "I only did what I was told to do, as well as I could." Hayha died in 2002 and was buried under <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simo_H%C3%A4yh%C3%A4#/media/File:Simo_H%C3%A4yh%C3%A4's_grave.jpg">a tombstone</a></b> reading "Home -- Religion -- Fatherland."</p>

      <p>In January 1941, Britain’s Winston Churchill <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeqhDYaBfoU">said</a></b> of the ongoing war "Finland shows what free men can do.... Everyone can see how communism rots the soul of a nation; how it makes it abject and hungry in peace, and proves it base and abominable in war. We cannot tell what the fate of Finland may be, but no more mournful spectacle could be presented...than that this splendid northern race should be at last worn down and reduced to servitude worse than death by the dull brutish force of overwhelming numbers."</p>

      <p>Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev later recalled "All of us -- and Stalin first and foremost -- sensed in our victory a defeat by the Finns. It was a dangerous defeat because it encouraged our enemies' conviction that the Soviet Union was a colossus with feet of clay."</p>
