      <h1>Facebook launched a meme-making app called Whale. Here's why you haven't heard of it.</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:39:10+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/stan-schroeder/" target="_blank">Stan Schroeder</a></address>
      <p>Facebook's new app Whale lets you "make your own memes" with "pro tools." So why haven't you heard about it?</p>
      <p>Well, the company apparently doesn't want everyone to know about it just yet. According to a report by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/12ecc6">The Information</a>, Facebook's NPE (New Product Experimentation) group launched the app, and it's currently only available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/whale-meme-creator/id1482865335">Canadian App Store</a>. </p>
      <p>The official description says the Whale app is free to use with "no hidden subscription pricing," and it allows users to create memes with their own images or pictures from the app's stock photo library. Once you choose a photo, you can then add text, and various effects, emoji, stickers and other meme-related shenanigans. When you're done, you can save your freshly created memes to the camera roll, and/or share them to social media and message threads directly from the app. </p>
      <p>The app's description also states that it's been "developed by NPE Team, from Facebook."</p>
      <p>We first heard about the <a href="https://tech.fb.com/npe-team-from-facebook/">NPE Team</a> this July. Facebook said it's a consumer-focused app group that focuses on "shipping entirely new experiences." The apps might change very rapidly, Facebook warned at the time, and might be shut down if Facebook decides they're not useful. The company also said that wider availability of the apps created by the NPE Team will "depend on the app."</p>
      <p>The NPE Team <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebooks-app-factory-aims-for-teens-with-two-new-apps">previously built</a> two other teen-oriented apps, called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/developer/npe-team/id1474289546">Bump and Aux</a>. The <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/aux-live-school-radio/id1474289547">AUX</a> app is a party DJ app, while <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/bump-make-new-friends/id1474661920">Bump</a> lets you start anonymous one-on-one chats with people in your community. </p>
