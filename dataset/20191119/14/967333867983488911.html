        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): WhatsApp spygate landed the Indian government in hot water in October when Israeli spyware Pegasus was reportedly used to hack the mobile phones of several activists, journalists, and academics.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Indian Home Ministry on Tuesday clarified in Parliament that no blanket permission has been given to any agency for the interception or monitoring of phone calls.</p>
      <p>Replying to a question in the Parliament’s lower house Lok Sabha on whether the government <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910311077189928-indian-govt-seeks-clarification-from-whatsapp-on-latest-data-breach---report/">taps</a> WhatsApp calls and messages, the Minister of State (Home Ministry) said in a written reply:</p>
      <blockquote>“There is no blanket permission to any agency for interception or monitoring or decryption. Permission from competent authority is required".</blockquote>
      <p>The question was raised by Dayanidhi Maran, an MP from Tamil Nadu.</p>
      <p>The government reply, meanwhile, clarified that the Information technology Act of 2000 empowers both central and state governments to investigate any computer in the interest of Indian sovereignty.</p>
      <p>The statement comes weeks after WhatsApp claimed that Israeli cyber Intelligence Company NSO Group <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911011077195479-indias-opposition-squirm-over-whatsapp-snooping-alleges-its-leaders-judges-could-be-on-radar-/">was snooping</a> on Indian activists and journalists via spyware called "Pegasus" that can compromise a device and get access to all of a target's data.</p>
