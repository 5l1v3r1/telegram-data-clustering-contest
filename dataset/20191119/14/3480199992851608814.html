      <p>Lamborghini’s Gallardo is the nation’s favourite supercar, according to a provider of driving experiences.</p>
      <p>According to trackdays.co.uk, 19.5 per cent of its supercar experience bookings see customers ask to drive the Italian machine — despite it going out of production in 2013.</p>

      <p>Imran Malek, operations manager at TrackDays.co.uk, said: “Our latest research indicates that the Lamborghini Gallardo is by far the most popular supercar for Brits to drive if they had the chance.</p>
      <p>“Perhaps that’s to be expected given that it’s among the pinnacle of Italian automotive styling with breath-taking looks, coupled with mighty performance figures.”</p>
      <p>Following closely behind the Gallardo is the mechanically-related Audi R8, which accounts for 12.1 per cent. In third is Nissan GT-R — with 9.1 per cent of bookings made seeing customers get behind the wheel of the Japanese icon.</p>

      <p>The highest-ranked British machine comes in the form of the Aston Martin V8 Vantage — with 9 per cent of experiences seeing the Gaydon-built car used. Matching that for popularity is the Ferrari 430, with its predecessor, the 360, following just behind at 8.3 per cent of takers.</p>
      <p>Other popular Brits come in the form of the Ariel Atom at 7.2 per cent of bookings, and Aston Martin DB9 with seven per cent.</p>
      <p>Malek added: “It’s great to see that Brits have such a fondness for British models which make up almost a third of our most desirable supercars to drive.”</p>
