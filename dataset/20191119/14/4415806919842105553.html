      <h1>The second leader for Operation Transformation 2020 has been announced</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:42:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/anna-odonoghue/" target="_blank">By Anna O'Donoghue</a></address>
      <p>The second leader of Operation Transformation 2020 has been revealed by RTÉ Lifestyle.</p>
      <p>49-year-old Jean Kinahan from Tullamore, Co Offaly will join Claire Beakhurst from Malahide, Co Dublin as one of the five leaders for this year's show.</p>
      <p>One of 12 children – six girls and six boys – Jean has lived in Tullamore all her life.</p>
      <p>The full-time special needs assistant lives with her husband Podge and their dogs, Walter and Lexie.</p>
      <p>She has two children, Natasha 25 and Jake, 23, who have recently moved out of the family home.</p>
      <p>It's been a tumultuous year for Jeanie, as in March 2019 doctors found a growth on her ovaries and removed them.</p>
      <p>She woke up from surgery smack bang in menopause, which she says is “no craic at all”.</p>
      <p>She doesn't feel sexy or feminine anymore, and the knock to her confidence is clear to everyone around her.</p>
      <p>As her 50th birthday edges nearer, Jeanie says she doesn't want to hit that age at her current weight, and with her daughter getting married on 1 February next year, the pressure is on.</p>
      <p>Speaking exclusively to RTÉ Lifestyle, Kinahan said she wants to be a sexy mother of the bride, not a frumpy one.</p>
