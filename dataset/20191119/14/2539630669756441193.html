      <h1>Slimbook Tease New Linux Laptop in Apple-Bashing Video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:30:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:30</time> by <a rel="author">By Joey Sneddon</a></address>
      <p><b>Fruitarians, apple fans, and the easily traumatised might not find the latest marketing campaign from <a href="https://slimbook.es/">Slimbook</a> particularly funny</b>.</p>
      <p>The Spanish company is promoting an upcoming hardware launch with a bizarre new video campaign that involves bashing apple.</p>
      <p>And in case you’re wondering, I don’t mean the video sees people criticising <i>Apple</i>™.</p>
      <p>No, I’m talking <i>literal</i> apple bashing here!</p>

      <p>The video, which should be embedded above, is relatively short and relatively bizarre. It follows a Slimbook engineer in a penguin mask carefully measuring an apple before getting up and smashing it with a baseball bat bearing the Slimbook brand name.</p>
      <p>Accompanying the clip are the hashtags #NoMoreFruit and #ForgetTheFruit — a playful dig at a certain fruit-branded company whose laptops are fairly popular? I think so.</p>
      <p>The video also reveals that Slimbook will announce its new device on November 21, 2019 via the Slimbook website.</p>
      <p>But that’s all we know.</p>
      <p>Specific details about the product are being revealed a daily basis <a href="https://slimbook.es/en/new">on a holding page</a> on the Slimbook website, and includes the relative graphics and CPU performance versus other Slimbook laptops, like the <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/06/slimbook-pro-x-linux-laptop-specs-price">Slimbook Pro X</a>.</p>
      <p>Based on the information revealed thus far we can make a couple of qualified guesses.</p>
      <p>The new device is a <b>15-inch laptop</b> that’s 16mm thin and powered by an <b><a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/191045/intel-core-i7-9750h-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-50-ghz.html">Intel Core-i7-9750H</a></b> processor (up to 4.5Ghz, 6-core, 12 threads). It’ll boast Super RAID NvME and offer up to 12 hours of battery life.</p>
      <p>But for details on RAM, GPU and ports you, I and everyone else, will have to wait until Thursday November 21 for the full reveal.</p>
