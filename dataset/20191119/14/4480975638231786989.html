          <b>Technology shares capitalize on upbeat market mood on Tuesday.</b>

      <p>Wall Street's main indexes started the day in the positive territory on Tuesday on the back of an improved <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">market sentiment</a> despite a lack of positive developments on the United States (US)-China trade conflict. As of writing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 were both up 0.1% on the day while the Nasdaq Composite was adding 0.3%.</p>
      <p>Among the 11-major S&amp;P 500 sectors, the risk-sensitive Technology Index is adding around 0.4% to lead the winners in the early trade. On the other hand, the defensive Real Estate and Utilities indexes trade in red to confirm the upbeat market mood.</p>
      <p>There won't be any macroeconomic data releases from the US on Tuesday that could impact stock markets' action and investors will be awaiting fresh trade war headlines.Â </p>
