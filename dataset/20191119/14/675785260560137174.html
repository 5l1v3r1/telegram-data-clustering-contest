      <h1>Alan Shearer names his England XI for Euro 2020 as Three Lions breeze through qualifying</h1>
      <h2>Gareth Southgate faces plenty of selection dilemmas ahead of England's Euro 2020 campaign with Joe Gomez and James Maddison pressing their cases</h2>

      <p>Joe Gomez partnering Harry Maguire in defence and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain getting a start in England's midfield.</p>
      <p>That is how the Three Lions would line up if Alan Shearer was in charge for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Instead it is Gareth Southgate who will lead England into the Euros having won seven of their eight qualifying games.</p>
      <p>But he has several selection dilemmas with very few of England's starting berths nailed down.</p>
      <p>The front three is pretty set with Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling two of the Three Lions front three, but Shearer reckons Marcus Rashford will get the nod alongside them.</p>

      <p>"Any manager would like to have Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford," he said in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10373081/alan-shearer-euro-2020-southgate-sancho-kane/">The Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>"But Gareth Southgate can also choose from Callum Hudson-Odoi, Mason Mount, Jadon Sancho, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tammy Abraham, James Maddison and others.</p>
      <p>The way they attack and go forward, with those options, means they can and will score against anybody."</p>

      <p>Liverpool's Gomez, who was at the centre of the incident with Sterling that saw him booed by sections of the Wembley last week, is Shearer's pick alongside Maguire provided he can play regularly at Anfield.</p>
      <p>He had begun to develop a strong partnership with Virgil van Dijk before injury struck last season and Shearer reckons his versatility could prove vital.</p>
      <p>He added: "He (Gomez) still has a decision to make over the centre-half pairing. It would really help if Joe Gomez can play regularly for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> . That’s going to be difficult but he can play right-back as well."</p>
      <p>While in midfield the former England frontman reckons a host of youngsters could still force their way in, but James Maddison is at the front of the queue.</p>
      <p>He continued: "In those attacking midfield positions, James Maddison hasn’t had a full opportunity as yet but he’s got a really good chance before the summer.</p>
      <p>"There’s no doubt he has the ability. So does Jack Grealish but it’s going to be difficult for Phil Foden to get into the City team."</p>
