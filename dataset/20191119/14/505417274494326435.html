      <p>Following the event, video footage circulated of a member of the <a href="https://punditarena.com/gaa/kennedymarisa760/report-card-limerick-top-class/">Limerick</a> panel fighting with a person on the streets of New York.</p>
      <p>The video footage circulated far and wide and now the county board have released a statement confirming that those involved have been sent home.</p>
      <p>“Limerick GAA can confirm it sent home two panellists early from last weekend’s New York Hurling Classic following an incident.</p>
      <p>“Limerick GAA expects the highest standards of behaviour and example from its players, both on and off the field, and will not tolerate any breach of those standards.</p>
      <p>“A disciplinary process has commenced and there will be no further comment in relation to this matter.”</p>
