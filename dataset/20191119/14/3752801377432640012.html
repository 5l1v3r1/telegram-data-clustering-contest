      <p>Ferreira-Watt, 51, was hit in her hip when a weapon - believed to be a shotgun booked in as evidence in a house robbery case - was discharged in court. She later died in hospital.</p>
      <p>Art dealer Sonja Nel of Sonja Nel paintings paid tribute to the lawyer, saying she was a "patron of us artists".</p>
      <p>"[She was] always encouraging us and making us feel our best. She managed to enter the hearts of our homes and touched each of our lives in a very specific way."</p>
      <p>She added: "We salute you our dear friend. Our hearts are very sore and heavy today as we are saying our goodbyes. Words are too few to express our loss. May you rest in peace."</p>
