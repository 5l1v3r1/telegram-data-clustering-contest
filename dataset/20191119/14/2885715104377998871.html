      <p>Reliance Jio on Tuesday said it will hike its tariff rates in the next few weeks. The statement from the Mukesh Ambani-led company comes a day after Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd announcing a hike in call and data charges from next month.</p>
      <p>Jio said telecom regulator TRAI is likely to initiate consultation process for revision in telecom tariffs.</p>
      <p>“Like other operators, we will also work with the government and comply with the regulatory regime to strengthen the industry to benefit Indian consumers and take measures including appropriate increase in tariffs in next few weeks in a manner that does not adversely impact data consumption or growth in digital adoption and sustains investments,” it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Jio added 69.83 lakh new users to its network in September this year while Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel lost over 49 lakh users, according to TRAI data.</p>
      <p>However, Vodafone Idea remains the largest telecom service in terms of subscriber base (37.24 cr) in the country closely followed by Jio (35.52 cr) and Bharti Airtel (32.55 cr).</p>
      <p>As on September 30, 2019, Vodafone Idea had a subscriber market share of 31.73 per cent, Reliance Jio had a market share of 30.26 per cent, and Bharti Airtel of 27.74 per cent.</p>
      <p>State-run MTNL saw 8,717 users move out (33.93 lakh user base), while BSNL added 7.37 lakh users to take its total base to 11.69 crore.<br/>The wireless teledensity in India increased from 88.77 at the end of August to 88.90 at the end of September, TRAI said.</p>
