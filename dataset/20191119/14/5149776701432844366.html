      <h1>Nottingham New Year's Eve plans confirmed for Old Market Square</h1>
      <h2>Celebrations have once again been moved to Slab Square while the Castle is closed for redevelopment</h2>

      <p>It's hard to believe but there really isn't much left of this year and, indeed, decade.</p>
      <p>While many of us may wish time would just slow down for a sweet minute, at least with the dawn of the 2020s we can stop awkwardly making reference to the 'teens' or 'teenies'.</p>
      <p>As last year, Nottingham's free New Year's Eve celebrations have once again been moved to Old Market Square while the Castle undergoes a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/nottingham-castle-close-when-reopen-1705457">Â£30m "world class" transformation</a> which is set to include a new visitors' centre, access to more caves and a Robin Hood gallery.</p>
      <p>Taking place from 8pm to 1am on Tuesday, December 31, the festive fun will include a free street party, live music, a DJ set and of course, a huge fireworks display at midnight.</p>
      <p>Nottingham's Christmas lights switch-on was down-sized this year amid plans to inject further funds into the NYE's party and fireworks, so it should be pretty spectacular.</p>
