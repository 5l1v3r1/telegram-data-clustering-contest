      <h1>Son digs grave for alive mother over property dispute</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:48:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/arjun-raghunath" target="_blank">Arjun Raghunath</a></address>
      <p>A son has allegedly dug a grave for his mother, who was still alive, following a property dispute at Malappuram district in North Kerala.</p>
      <p>The Kerala Women's Commission has directed the Kerala police to register a case against the son after he refused to cover the grave.</p>
      <p>Siddique, a native of Tirunavaya, has prepared the grave for his mother, who is in her 70s, at the premises of their house allegedly after the mother insisted that the family property would be shared only after her death.Â The incident occurred about a year back.</p>
      <p>The matter came up before the Women's Commission several months back and the commission directed the son to cover the grave. Several local persons and relatives also initiated mediation. But Sidiqque, who is an engineer with BSNL, refused to cover the grave.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, the Women's Commission considered the case again on a sitting the other day and directed the local police to register a case against the accused.</p>
      <p>The commission member E M Radha told <i>DH</i> that the commission would be following up on the matter. "We are awaiting a report from the police on the steps taken. Further actions would be taken afterward," she said.</p>
      <p>She said that the deed of the son caused much mental agony to the aged mother and hence she approached the women's commission with a petition. She is now under the care of her younger son.</p>
      <p>Siddique was not financially weak and his wife is also employed. Even then he insisted on share of family property from his mother. He alleged that his mother was giving property to her younger son.</p>
      <p>Radha also said that a good number of petitions being received by the commissioner pertained to harassment over property disputes.</p>
