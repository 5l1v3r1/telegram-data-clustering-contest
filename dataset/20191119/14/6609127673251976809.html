        <b>A TEENAGER who was part of a gang of online paedophile hunters who attacked a notorious online troll has been banned from carrying out vigilante stings.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jay Sharkey, 18, was among the group of Wolf Pack Hunters UK (WPH) who tracked down troll Stewart McInroy to Edinburgh bus station last year.</p>

      <p>The group claimed McInroy had been sending sexual threats to them including threats of rape.</p>
      <p>The WPH gang cornered McInroy at the bus station before members of the group began punching and butting him to the face.</p>
      <p>Sharkey, from Glasgow, took part in the vicious assault that left McInroy bleeding heavily by repeatedly punching him to the face.</p>
      <p>The violent attack was live streamed on the WPH Facebook page by one of the members.</p>

      <p>Sharkey had admitted his part in the attack when he appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court last month and he returned to the dock for sentencing.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Robert Weir placed the teenager on a two-year supervision order and banned him from taking part in WPH activities for the same period.</p>
      <p>The sheriff had previously banned three WPH members for their part in the bus station assault on 28-year-old McInroy.</p>
      <p>Karen Ferry, 48, Martin Kuciak, 38 and William Brown, 41, were all handed two-year bans from having any involvement in the WPH online vigilante stings.</p>
      <p>Ferry, from Mayfield, Midlothian, and Kuciak, from Drylaw, Edinburgh were also replaced on supervision for two years and told to carry out 150 and 180 hours of unpaid work respectively.</p>
      <p>Brown, from Stranraer, was also placed on supervision for two years and told he cannot leave his home address between 7pm and 7am for the next four months.</p>
      <p>Fifth member Gordon Buchan, 39, had his not guilty pleas to the abduction and assault charges accepted by the Crown and he walked free from the dock.</p>
      <p>Previously the court heard McInroy had sent the group abusive online messages for around two years before they eventually tracked him down to Edinburgh bus station last September.</p>
      <p>Kuciak and Sharkey, 18, grabbed hold of McInroy and dragged him from the station before the teenager repeatedly punched his victim to the face.</p>
      <p>Brown also arrived on the scene in his car and proceeded to head butt McInroy to the face during the violent confrontation.</p>
      <p>Ferry helped the gang to surround McInroy while recording the meeting on her phone and live streaming it to the Wolf Pack Hunters UK Facebook page.</p>
      <p>During the attack Ferry was heard to shout “f***ing dirty beast” and “f***ing paedophile” at McInroy.</p>
      <p>McInroy, 28 was left covered in blood from a facial injury following the attack at the capital’s bus station on September 27 last year.</p>
      <p>The Wolf Pack Hunters UK are a group who set up fake online child profiles in a bid to make contact with paedophiles looking to meet up with children for sexual activity.</p>
      <p>Conversations are held online before meetings are then set up with alleged sexual offenders and the confrontations are live streamed to the WPH UK Facebook page.</p>
      <p>The WPH UK group has been responsible for scores of arrests and convictions of online child abusers.</p>
      <p>There is no suggestion McInroy was involved in any child abuse activities.</p>

      <p>McInroy was jailed for 10 months in August 2014 after he admitted to <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4674918/troll-paedophile-hunters-battered-brutal-edinburgh-attack/">trolling the family of missing Fife man Allan Bryant by claiming he had tortured and killed the missing 27-year-old</a>.</p>
      <p>McInroy was then sentenced to an eight month prison term last year for a similar offence against the Bryant family but was released after serving just one month following a successful appeal.</p>
