      <p>“I did embarrassingly do a vocal audition for ‘Trolls’,” Miller said. “And I was like, ‘Ooh, Trolls! Okay, I’m gonna do something unique,’ which was the stupidest voice… which [Marlowe], at 3 [years old], thought was amazing. I was like, ‘I crushed it.’ Sent it off and didn’t get it.”</p>
      <p>She added, “But I’m sure that there will be a tape circulating around that studio of the ridiculous troll voice that I thought was appropriate.”</p>

      <p>In the end, it was for the best, as Miller learned.</p>
      <p>“Then I watched the movie,” she said. “She just did a great, kind of normal voice. So I was really off the mark… I wanted to be that troll.”</p>
