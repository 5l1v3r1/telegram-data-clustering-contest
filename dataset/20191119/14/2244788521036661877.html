        <b> Acheju Abuh, the Women Leader of PDP’s Wada/Aro Campaign Council, was on Monday set ablaze by a group of suspected political thugs in her home at Ochadamu in Ofu local government area of Kogi state after last Saturday’s governorship election in the state.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was learnt that the suspected thugs who invaded the home of the victim at about 2:00 pm, locked all exits in the house and poured petrol on it before incinerating the house.</p>
      <p>According to the report by<a href="https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/just-in-thugs-burn-kogi-pdp-women-leader-prevent-rescue-operation.html"> DailyTrust</a>, the woman was burnt on Monday afternoon by suspected thugs alleged to be loyal to All Progressive Congress (APC)-the the ruling party in the state.</p>
      <p>The suspected thugs were said to have prevented locals from coming to the rescue of the woman as they shot sporadically to scare people away and kept watch until the building had been razed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://punchng.com/pdp-woman-leader-burnt-alive-at-home-in-kogi/">Eyewitness</a> account claimed that Abuh attempted to escape through a window but was prevented by the metal burglary proof and gunshots with bullets raining in her direction.</p>
      <p>“The bloodthirsty thugs waited, shooting and watching with relish while Mrs Abuh cried from inside the inferno until her voice died out.”</p>
      <p>The thugs were said to have dispersed when the entire house and Mrs Abuh had been completely burnt.</p>
      <p>William Aya, the spokesman of the Kogi Police Command, confirmed the incident to the media, said it was a case of culpable homicide and mischief by fire.</p>
      <p>Aya said that about 4:30 pm,  November 18, 2019, one Musa Etu of Ochadamu, Ofu LGA reported at the station that, at about 10:30 of the same date, there was a misunderstanding between one Awolu Zekeri, aged 35 years member of APC and one Gowon Simeon, a member of PDP both of Ochadamu.</p>
      <p>“In the process, Gowon Simeon stabbed Awolu Zekeri with a knife on his lap and he (Zekeri) died on his way to the hospital.</p>
      <p>“As a result, angry youths in the area mobilized to the house of one Simeon Abuh of the same address who is an uncle to the suspect, set it ablaze, thereby burnt one Salome Abuh aged 60 years.</p>
      <p>“Three other houses were equally burnt. The corpse has been moved to the University Teaching Hospital Mortuary Anyigba for Autopsy.</p>
      <p>“Meanwhile, the Police Mobile Force and Police Special Forces have been drafted to the area to prevent any breakdown of law and order. The investigation is ongoing”, Aya said.</p>
