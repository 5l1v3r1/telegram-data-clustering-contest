      <p>If you’ve ever spent hours in a mall (or browsing online) on a Saturday trying to find the perfect gift for someone in your life, then you know the experience can be, well, a little stressful. Of course, you want to make sure that your loved one <i>likes</i> the gift you get them, but you also want to know that they’ll use it regularly. This is why <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/these-40-things-are-cheap-actually-really-upgrade-your-home-17235296">home goods and accessories</a> make such amazing gifts — it doesn’t matter how someone's style changes or what season it is, people <i>always</i> use them.</p>
      <p>Don't get me wrong — gifts like clothing and jewelry are never a bad idea, but there’s just no guarantee that the people receiving them will wear them regularly enough to make the purchase truly worth it. But something like a super soft alpaca throw blanket or a giant, limited-edition candle? Those are things people need every day, all year long. And while gift-giving feels good in any capacity, it feels that much better to know that your money is being spent on something that won't end up shoved in the back of someone's closet.</p>
      <p>Below, check out the best cozy, practical gifts anyone would be happy to receive this holiday season.</p>
      <h3>Great Jones Dutchess Cast-Iron Dutch Oven</h3>

        <a href="https://greatjonesgoods.com/products/the-dutchess">The Dutchess Cast-Iron Dutch Oven In Macaron Color$145|Great Jones See On Great Jones</a>
      </p>
      <p>If this pastel pink dutch oven looks familiar, it’s because you’ve probably seen it all over Instagram — and for good reason. Not only is the Great Jones Dutchess Dutch Oven gorgeous, it’s also excellent, quality cookware for the price. Have a friend who just moved into a new home with a big kitchen? This is the perfect gift. The macaron color is a fan favorite, but it comes in six other shades as well.</p>
      <h3>Dyson Pure Cool Me Personal Purifying Fan</h3>

      </p>
      <p>If you have a friend who is constantly at their desk or is always asking for the AC to be turned a couple degrees down, the Dyson Pure Cool Me Personal Purifying Fan is the perfect gift. It’s practical, but given that Dyson is known for its top-notch technology, it’s a little bit luxurious, too. An added bonus? It purifies the air, capturing 99.97% of allergens and filtering them out before blowing air on you.</p>
      <h3>Nest Moroccan Amber Special Edition 3-Wick Candle</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/11/6/84cc176e-6887-4cbe-bf30-028fef05845d-nest.jpg?w=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>

        <a href="https://www.candledelirium.com/nest-moroccan-amber-special-edition-3-wick-candle/">Nest Moroccan Amber Special Edition 3-Wick Candle $72|Candle DeliriumSee On Candle Delirium</a>
      </p>
      <p>Candle aficionados know that Nest is the best of the best. The price of the brand’s special edition three-wick candles certainly reflects the quality, but also makes it the perfect opportunity to spoil someone in your life. Not a lot of people want to spend their own $72 on a giant, luxurious candle, but trust me, <i>everyone</i> wants one.</p>
      <h3>Anthropologie Silo Match Striker</h3>

        <a href="https://www.anthropologie.com/shop/silo-match-striker2">Silo Match Striker $42|Anthropologie See On Anthropologie</a>
      </p>
      <p>I’m a big fan of finding aesthetically pleasing alternatives for mundane household items like matches. Anthropologie’s Silo Match Striker turns an otherwise boring item and makes it something beautiful and unique. If you have a candle lover in your life who has everything (including all the candles), this would make a perfect, totally unexpected gift.</p>
      <h3>Diptyque Hourglass Diffuser</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/11/5/f52279de-e379-455a-be06-97b7df674e0e-diptyquediffuser.jpg?w=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>

      </p>
      <p>If you’ve never gifted someone a Diptyque product, then you should — if only to watch their face light up as they open the package. Diptyque is pure luxury when it comes to fragrance, and this hourglass diffuser is no different. It’s a statement piece that's super effective in making your whole space smell glorious, and it looks gorgeous sitting on a table or shelf.</p>
      <h3>Concrete Cat Ambrosia Lazy Susan</h3>

      </p>
      <p>For the person who has everything, there is this gorgeous concrete lazy susan that comes in a variety of colors. It may not be the most practical piece of all time, but hey, it does serve a purpose — and also, it’s <i>stunning</i>.</p>
      <h3>Serena &amp; Lilly Milo Alpaca Throw Blanket</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/11/5/dc62d7eb-b606-4280-abca-bca61a05f99c-serenalilyalpacablanket.jpg?w=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>

      <p>There’s nothing better than stepping out of the bath or shower onto a plush, extra soft rug.

It's simple (hence the name), but the construction means it'll feel great in someone's hand, plus look wonderful sitting on a shelf.</p>
