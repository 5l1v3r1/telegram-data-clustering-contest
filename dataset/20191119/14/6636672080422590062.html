      <h1>ST signs up for more Cree silicon carbide wafers</h1>

        <b>ST Microelectronics has extended its multi-year silicon carbide wafer deal with Cree, taking it to over $500m in total value.</b>

      <p>Cree will supply 150mm bare and epitaxial silicon carbide wafers to ST over “several years”, according to Cree.</p>
      <p>“Expanding our long-term wafer supply agreement with Cree will increase the flexibility of our global silicon carbide substrate supply,” said ST CEO Jean-Marc Chery. “It will further contribute to securing the required volume of substrate we need to manufacture our silicon carbide-based products as we ramp up production over the next years for automotive and industrial customers.”</p>
      <p>“Silicon carbide delivers performance enhancements that are critical to electric vehicles and industrial solutions for solar, energy storage and UPS systems,” claimed Cree CEO Gregg Lowe – and it is automotive and industrial customers that ST is aiming at.</p>
      <p>ST appears to be on a mission to build a solid SiC supply chain.</p>
      <p>In February it acquired a majority stake in Swedish SiC wafer manufacturer Norstel, and with its Q3 results announced that it will exercise its option to purchase the remaining 45% stake, and now expects to close this during Q4.</p>
      <p>ST’s ambition is to be a leader in SiC mosfets and diodes, said a ST spokesman, in a market the firm estimates at $3B annually by 2025.</p>
      <p>The original Cree supply agreement was also signed earlier this year, and doubled in value by extension</p>
      <p>Silicon carbide transistors are more expensive than similar silicon parts, but faster, more rugged and can be lower loss. The result is smaller lighter chargers, power inverters and motor controllers – something that is tempting electric vehicle makers, particularly, some claim, as overall system cost savings are to be had.</p>
