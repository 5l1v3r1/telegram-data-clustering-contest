      <p>Independent presidential candidate Dr Panduleni Itula, and others, are demanding the withdrawal of the electronic voting machines (EVMs) during the upcoming National Assembly and Presidential Elections.<br/>Itula is joined by the Workers' Revolutionary Party (WRP) and the Namibia Economic Freedom Fighters (NEFF) in the application.<br/>According to the applicants, the election administration body, the Electoral Commission of Namibia (ECN) has been approached many times to prove the credibility of the EVMs but has not responded hence the urgent application before the court.<br/>The applicant is further demanding the court order for the simultaneous use of ballot papers with the EVMs, for verification purposes, as an alternative to the complete withdrawal of the EVMs from the entire process.<br/>Dr Itula's lawyers have noted issues such as the reported lost of EVMs that put into question whether the use of the machines during the elections would influence the final election results.<br/>ECN's legal team says there's no factual nor legal reason from the applicants to have any of the orders ruled by the Election Tribunal in their advantage.<br/>It further argues that the application timing is wrong as the election is around the corner and also that the High Court has decided on the matter in 2014 hence the application be removed from the court roll.</p>
