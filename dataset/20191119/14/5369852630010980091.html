      <p>TROY PARROTT IS in line to lead the attack for the Republic of Ireland U21s in their vital Euro 2021 qualifier with Sweden tonight.</p>
      <p>The Dubliner has linked up with Stephen Kenny’s squad this morning after being an unused substitute for the senior side’s 1-1 draw against Denmark at Aviva Stadium last night.</p>
      <p>Parrott’s return is a huge boost for Kenny’s side as it was the 17-year-old who inspired the recent 3-1 win away to the Swedes, when he netted twice after being sprung from the bench.</p>
      <p>Ireland are currently top of Group 1 and victory at Tallaght Stadium tonight (kick off 8pm) will keep their noses in front of Italy in second spot.</p>
