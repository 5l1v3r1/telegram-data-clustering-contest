      <p>A tractor driver who caused the death of a motorcyclist after cutting into his path has been spared a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/prisons">prison sentence</a></p>
      <p>William Dykes was towing a trailer when he pulled in front of a Harley Davidson driven by Colin Rutherford, who had no time to react and was thrown from the bike.</p>
      <p>Dykes fought to revive Mr Rutherford with CPR until paramedics arrived but he died at the remote scene.</p>
      <p>The 61-year-old, of Eaglesham, Renfrewshire, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/tractor-driver-admits-causing-death-20699202">admitted driving without due care and attention</a> and causing the victim's death on the A77 at Floak junction, Ayrshire.</p>
      <p>He had failed to keep a proper lookout for oncoming traffic and crossed onto the opposite carriageway while turning into an access road for Floak Farm, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/courts">Kilmarnock Sheriff Court</a> heard.</p>

      <p>Gordon Nicol, defending, said Dykes could not explain why he failed to see the motorbike on August 11, 2018 and added: "It was an awful moment of inattention that he will live with for the rest of his days.</p>
      <p>"The situation is a tragedy from every point of view. He cannot for the life of him understand how he failed to see the bike coming towards him.</p>
      <p>"He thinks about Mr Rutherford and what happened every day of his life and realises whatever happens today will never be compensation to the family."</p>

      <p>Passing sentence, Sheriff Elizabeth McFarlane said Mr Rutherford's death had left a "massive void" in the lives of his family, some of whom were in court.</p>
      <p>She said: "This accident reminds us all that drivers have a duty to be vigilant when on the road precisely because the consequences of failure can be so extreme.</p>
      <p>"Nobody believes that you set out on the morning of August 11 2018 to injure of kill anyone. The social worker who met you to draw up her report found that you expressed genuine remorse.</p>

      <p>"I accept that you live with the fatal consequences of your actions every day and will continue to do so for the rest of your life."</p>
      <p>Sheriff McFarlane added: "Despite the tragic consequences, in all of the circumstances I do not find it necessary to impose a custodial sentence on you."</p>
      <p>First offender Dykes' was given a six-month curfew tagging order, 200 hours unpaid work and banned from the road for three years, with a compulsory resit of his driving test.</p>
      <p>Mr Rutherford, 61, of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/irvine">Irvine</a>, was well-known in the biking community and had worked as a Harley Davidson technician at dealerships in Edinburgh and Glasgow, before setting up House of Custom with a friend in Clydebank.</p>
      <p>His skill at customising Harleys earned him prizes in the UK, Portugal and USA.</p>
