      <p>West Kelowna RCMP's detachment commander has received a high honour.</p>
      <p>Staff Sgt. Duncan Dixon was one of 40 recipients to be invested into the Order of Merit of the Police Forces at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on oct. 31.</p>
      <p>Gov. Gen. Julie Payette and RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki presented the honour.</p>
      <p>"Those who received an Order of Merit truly exemplify what it means to work for a Canadian police service. This award recognizes more than just a single action, it’s an accumulation of the outstanding work you have done over the past several decades," said Lucki.</p>
      <p>"From leading organizational change initiatives, to connecting with communities, and building grassroots partnerships, to working on high-profile operations and investigations, you have dedicated your careers and many, many personal hours to protecting the safety and security of Canadians while improving the lives of those around you."</p>
      <p>Dixon joined the RCMP almost 28 years ago, and has led the West Kelowna detachment for 11 years as well as being part of the Southeast District Tactical Troop.</p>
      <p>Dixon has served in all four of the RCMP districts in B.C. and is also in charge of policing services in Peachland, Joe Rich and Big White.</p>
      <p>"I take pride in my commitment to serving Canada," said Dixon. "Each and every day, I strive to make things better for the residents of each of the communities I serve, and I thoroughly enjoy the camaraderie I share with my employees, of whom I am humbled to serve alongside."</p>
