      <p>Ukraine will introduce fines from November 20, 2019, for transporting children without child car seats.</p>
      <p>The relevant law on amendments to the Code of Ukraine on administrative offenses regarding liability for violation of rules of transporting children was published in the parliamentary newspaper Holos Ukrainy on November 19.</p>
      <p>Under the law, children under age 12 and those who are less than 145 cm tall should be transported in child car seats or booster seats. The drivers will pay a fine of UAH 510 (US$21) for the first violation of the law; repeated violations will be fined UAH 850 (US$35).</p>
      <p>The law will apply to all types of motor vehicles.</p>
      <p>As reported earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky enacted the law on November 15.</p>
      <p>Prior to this, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament, passed draft law No. 1150 as a basis and as a whole.</p>
