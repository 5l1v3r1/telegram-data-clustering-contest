      <p>As two of the most respected captains in the PSL, Thulani Hlatshwayo and Hlompho Kekana are upstanding figures at their respective clubs.</p>
      <p>However, who drives the hottest GTI between the captains?</p>
      <p>Both of these stars are vastly experienced and are willing to leave it all on the field for Bidvest Wits and Mamelodi Sundowns respectively. </p>

      <p>Another thing they have in common is that they are both brand ambassadors of Volkswagen, Tyson with an affinity for the Constantia branch, while Hlompho opted for the Polokwane branch in his hometown.</p>
      <p>It seems that the flashy Golf 7 is a captain’s car, as both stars get around in a GTI. </p>
