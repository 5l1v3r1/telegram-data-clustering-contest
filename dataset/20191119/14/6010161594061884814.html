      <p>Bloober Team’s take on the horror franchise Blair Witch is coming to PlayStation 4 next month.</p>
      <p><b>Blair Witch</b> will be released on PlayStation 4 December 3, Bloober Team announced today.</p>
      <p>Originally released in August on PC and Xbox One, the game is a first-person psychological horror title based on the cinematic lore of the films.</p>
      <p>Set in 1996, you play as a former Maryland police officer who is helping search for a missing boy. You will explore the Black Hills Forest near Burkittsville, and not only face your past but evil forces within the forest.</p>
      <p>You won’t be traversing the woods alone with just a flashlight, because your trusty German Shepherd, Bullet, will be by your side. He will alert you to danger and find important items, and how you treat him will affect his behavior.</p>
