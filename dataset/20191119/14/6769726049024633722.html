      <h1>Timber structure of jetties set for removal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:29:30+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:29</time> by <a rel="author">Kristie Lim</a></address>
      <p>THE termite-infested decking of the two jetties at Point Reserve will be removed this week after the Town of Bassendean received approvals from State Government departments.</p>
      <p>The Town announced on <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/eastern-reporter/news/termite-problem-causes-removal-of-jetties/">November 11</a> that it would remove the unsafe timber structure of the 70-year-old jetties after it was found the timber structures were infested with termites.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.bassendean.wa.gov.au/news/update-on-jetties-at-point-reserve/372">announcement</a> resulted in community backlash and a petition for repairs gaining more than 550 signatures in a week.</p>
      <p>It then made another announcement on its website that <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/eastern-reporter/news/residents-sign-petition-to-repair-jetties/">the council would consider replacement options</a> and consult the <a href="https://www.transport.wa.gov.au/">Department of Transport (DoT)</a> and<a href="https://www.dbca.wa.gov.au/"> Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions</a> (DBCA) and Bassendean MLA Dave Kelly.</p>
      <p>The departments gave conditional permits for the Town to replace the timber structure of the north jetty.</p>
      <p>According to Town chief executive Peta Mabbs’ report on the council’s November 19 briefing agenda, works to remove the decking on the north and south jetties would be undertaken this week.</p>
      <p>The works cost $28,000 and is funded from the Town’s emergency contingency fund.</p>

      <p>DoT coastal facilities director Donna West said the Town obtained approval to replace the decking on the north jetty on the condition the decking was replaced in the same footprint as the current structure, the site was kept safe and a ‘Notice to Mariners’ was issued.</p>
      <p>“The Town has advised the Department community consultation will be undertaken to determine its future actions in regard to the southern jetty,” she said.</p>
      <p>A DBCA spokesperson said the Department issued a permit last week for works on the jetties to mitigate public safety risks.</p>
      <p>Mr Kelly said a number of residents have contacted his office to express their concern about the future of the jetties.</p>
      <p>“I am happy to pass these concerns on to the Town of Bassendean and make sure they’re aware of the significance these jetties hold for the community,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ms Mabbs said wooden jetties were a challenge for local governments along the Swan River, given their deteriorating state and weathering caused by erosion from speeding boats, termites and original construction methods.</p>
      <p>“It’s clearly part of the history of our area,” she said.</p>
      <p>“This is an opportunity for us to take stock and plan for the future amenity of the community and its connection to the river.”</p>
      <p>She said the footings for the first jetty was in good condition so they could remain until consideration was given to the future requirement for jetty amenity at the reserve.</p>
      <p>Councillors will consider a further report in December which will include an update on the future considerations for the jetties and cost of physical works to reinstate the north jetty.</p>
