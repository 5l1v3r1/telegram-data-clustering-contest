      <p>Anganwadi workers took out a protest rally in Belagavi on Tuesday opposing compulsory election duty and also in support of their other demands.</p>
      <p>They marched to the Deputy Commissioner’s office and shouted slogans against the government. They submitted a memorandum with a list of demands to the Deputy Commissioner’s office and dispersed.</p>
      <p>They complained that the State government had drafted them for election duty despite several appeals by them against it. They said that they have been asked to conduct a survey of tuberculosis-affected persons in rural areas, without any Government Order or circular.</p>
      <p>They complained that several anganwadi workers were yet to get their remuneration for the last three months. They threatened to launch a district-wide agitation if their demands were not met.</p>
      <p>Karnataka State Anganwadi Workers and Assistants Association district president Nagesh Sateri, Meenakshi Kotagi, Yallubai Sheegihalli, Sujata Belgaonkar and others led the strike.</p>
