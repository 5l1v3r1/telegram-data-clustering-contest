      <p><a href="https://wwd.com/tag/rag-bone/">Rag &amp; Bone</a> has teamed with Japanese brand Bonum to create a limited-edition capsule collection. Made from <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/runway-ex-machina-robots-new-york-fashion-week-1203256336/">Rag &amp; Bone</a> deadstock, the pieces combine Bonum’s signature deconstruction and reworking techniques with elements that are central to Rag &amp; Bone’s aesthetic, including American workwear, English-inspired tailoring, military pieces and sporty influences.</p>
      <p>The capsule collection launched exclusively at a pop-up at <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/tokyo-2/">Tokyo</a>’s Isetan department store earlier this month, and will hit Rag &amp; Bone’s Omotesando, Ginza Six and Ginza Mitsukoshi stores Wednesday, before rolling out to the U.S. market via the brand’s e-commerce platform. The offering comprises 12 styles including jackets, pants, shirts, sweatshirts and bags.</p>
