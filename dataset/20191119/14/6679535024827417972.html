      <p>Contracting agencies would have to lose five to ten per cent of payment if they fail to complete works before deadline, Warangal Urban District Collector Prashanth Jeevan Patil said.</p>
      <p>He was reviewing the progress of several developmental projects being carried by the Kakatiya Urban Development Authority (KUDA) here on Tuesday. He said that Bhadrakali lake beautification work, funded by HRIDAY, should be completed by December-end.</p>
      <p>“The Bhadrakali bund beautification work is interlinked with 38 different components and hence there is a need to engage more work force and complete the project on time,” Mr. Patil said.</p>
      <p>Referring to the Jain temple near Padmakshi temple, which was ready for opening, the Collector wanted officials to collect ₹10 as entry fee per person and allow free access to children below 5 years of age. The temple timings would be between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m.</p>
      <p>Also, officials apprised the Collector on land acquisition for construction of the six-kilometre Inner Ring Road (IRR) from Urs to the second gate of Enumamula agriculture market yard. So far, the administration had acquired 28 acres and paid ₹69 crore to oustees and contemplating on constructing a road-over-bridge (ROB) on this stretch with an estimated cost of ₹15 crore.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Collector said that a special cell would be established to project KUDA as a real estate entity. “At least 200 acres would be acquired before next March as part of KUDA’s land pooling,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Patil released posters of Chekumuki Science Festival and World Toilet Day after the review meeting.</p>
