      <p>Xiaomi could be preparing a cheaper Mi Band 3i for November 21<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>Xiaomi’s succesful Mi Band series is about to win another member. That’s what suggests a new post shared by the company on Twitter. The post in question comes to promote the RunWithMi marathon with the words <i>“Good thiiings come to those who run”</i>. The three “i” are a perfect allusion to the Mi Band 3i which is rumored to go official on November 21.</p>

      <p>The RunWithMi marathon is in Bangalore on December 1 and Xiaomi will give finishers a free Mi Band 3i as a reward. The specifications and price of this new fitness tracker are unclear. However, we believe that the price may sit between the prices of Mi Band 3 and Mi Band 4. It may be slightly better than the last year’s model, but not so good like the recently released Mi Band 4.</p>
      <p>The Mi band 4 uses a 0.95-inch AMOLED color display (with 2.5D scratch-resistant tempered glass protection). The screen is 39.9% bigger when compared to the previous generation. Moreover, it has a fully upgraded 6-axis high-precision sensor. This brings 6 sports modes, tracking swimming data in real-time, supporting smart stroke recognition, 50 meters waterproof and more. We are curious to see if any of the above features will be present in the Mi Band 3i.</p>
