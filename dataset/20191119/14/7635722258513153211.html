      <h1>Billy Burns commits his future to Ulster with new two-year contract</h1>

        <b>Ulster out-half Billy Burns has put pen-to-paper on a new two-year deal to keep him with the province until the summer of 2022. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The 25-year old has been an instant hit at Kingspan Stadium following his summer 2018 arrival from Gloucester.</p>
      <p>Burns has gone on to make 28 appearances for Ulster, scoring 54 points in the process.</p>
      <p>20 of those 28 appearances have come as starts in a highly successful half-back partnership with scrum-half John Cooney.</p>
      <p>Burns has even had the chance to captain the province in their Guinness Pro 14 victory at home to Cardiff Blues earlier this season.</p>
      <p>He's played for England at U18 and U20 levels, but qualifies for Ireland through his paternal grandfather. He's yet to feature in an Ireland squad.</p>
      <p>Speaking about his fresh extension, Burns told Ulster's website, "Since joining Ulster last summer, I’ve made it my home and have really enjoyed my time here.</p>
      <p>"The support I’ve had has been incredible and we have a great group of players, so it was a no-brainer for me to extend my contract.</p>
      <p>"Kingspan Stadium is a great place to play rugby and I’m really pleased that I’ve got at least another couple of years of that to look forward to."</p>
      <p>Head coach Dan McFarland is chuffed to keep Burns on board, "It is great news that Billy has committed to Ulster.</p>
      <p>"He is still a young man who is desperate to keep learning and developing both as a player and athlete.</p>
      <p>"He has already contributed hugely on the pitch throughout last year’s campaign, and has demonstrated an excellent ability to lead a team.</p>
      <p>"We’re all looking forward to Billy being a driving force in our group into the future."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Injuries</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Burns contract extension is a chink of light on a bad day on the injury front for Ulster.</p>
      <p>Jack McGrath and Sam Carter both require surgery ahead of Friday's Heineken Champions Cup visit of Clermont Auvergne to Kingspan Stadium.</p>
      <p>Carter suffered a dislocated shoulder in last weekend's win away to Bath, and surgery is expected to rule him out for up to three months.</p>
      <p>McGrath must go under the knife for a thumb injury, and the <a href="https://www.ulsterrugby.com/2019/11/squad-update-19-nov-2019/">province say</a> his availability will be monitored over the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Rob Lyttle has been ruled out for an estimated six to eight weeks due to a shoulder injury.</p>
      <p>And Marcus Rea suffered a fractured jaw while on club duty with Ballynahinch and will be out for approximately six weeks.</p>
