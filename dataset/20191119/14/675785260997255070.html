      <p>A ‘possessed’ mum allegedly threw her two young children out of a third-floor window claiming that a ‘voice’ whispered to her that they were ‘devils’.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old woman, who has not been named, reportedly dropped her one-month old son and three-year-old daughter 40 feet to the ground before running away.</p>
      <p>The incident took place at the Le Lutetia residence in the Bondy commune of the suburbs of north-eastern Paris.</p>
      <p>She has since been arrested after police intercepted her as she ran towards the train station, La Depeche reports.</p>

      <p>The youngsters only survived the impact of the fall because the soil in front of the building is particularly sodden at this time of year.</p>
      <p>However, media reports say the three-year old girl could not feel her legs. </p>
      <p>On Monday evening, the baby boy's condition was described as being "serious".</p>
      <p>Both children are in hospital and the mother now remains in custody.</p>
      <p>The woman’s neighbour said she had “never seen this woman and her children before”.</p>
      <p>An investigation into the assault is ongoing.</p>
