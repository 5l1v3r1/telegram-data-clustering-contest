      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - An unsettled weather pattern will persist across the island chain through Tuesday, with locally heavy rainfall and thunderstorms possible statewide.</p>
      <p>The airmass will stabilize by Wednesday, but a showery wet trade wind pattern is expected to hold through the weekend.</p>
      <p>Breezy to windy conditions are expected Thursday through Saturday.</p>
      <p>Surf along all shores will remain below high surf advisory levels through Tuesday, but a new long-period northwest swell arriving Wednesday will require a high surf advisory for exposed shores of most islands through Thursday.</p>
      <p>Surf could approach the 25-foot threshold for a high surf warning.</p>
      <p>Another northwest swell arriving this weekend may also require a high surf advisory. In the meantime, a new northwest swell will likely peak tonight and lower Tuesday, with peak surf heights remaining below advisory levels.</p>
