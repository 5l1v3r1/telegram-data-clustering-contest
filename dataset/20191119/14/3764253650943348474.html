      <p><a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/695-super-eagles.html">Super Eagles</a> winger Henry Onyekuru could part ways with his French League side Monaco barely four months after joining them from Everton.</p>
      <p>The Monégasques paid about £12.5 million to secure the services of the Nigeria international having failed to kick a ball at the Goodison Park owing to his failure to secure a work permit.</p>
      <p>He has been struggling since he moved to France - making just four league appearances so far this campaign with an assist credited to his name.</p>

      <p>HITC.com reports that the Nigerian star has not been himself since their former sporting director Luis Campos joined Lille.</p>
      <p>And the club chiefs are worried that Onyekuru is not living up to expectations – not to mention his hefty price-tag.</p>
      <p>Although, the 22-year-old has endured a torrid time at his new club owing to the numerous injuries he has suffered at the start of his career at the outfit.</p>

      <p>He has however fallen out of favour with coach Leonardo Jardim, who has handed the player just two league starts – and they both came in August.</p>
      <p>Reports from Monaco claims that Onyekuru could be heading back to Galatasaray on loan in January in a bid to revive his career according to Sporx.</p>
