      <p>A Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus conductor in Bengaluru was Tuesday suspended for allegedly pushing a 16-year-old girl out of a moving bus because she did not have the correct pass.</p>
      <p>The victim has been identified as Bhoomika, a first-year pre-university course (PUC) student at Jyothi Kendriya Vidyalaya in Yelachenahalli, south Bengaluru. According to the police, she suffered injuries on her forehead and left knee and also broke her teeth after the conductor pushed her out of the bus.</p>

      <p>An officer from Konanakunte police station, where a case was registered against the conductor, said: “Bhoomika had boarded the bus towards Kanakapura around 3 pm on November 11. When the conductor asked her for the ticket and she showed him her bus pass, he said such passes were not accepted on this bus. She said she would get off at the next stop, but the conductor insisted she get down right away. After she requested him again, he allegedly pushed her out of the running bus.”</p>
