      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> are confident <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/22/chelsea-handed-two-window-transfer-ban-fined-460000-fifa-8710859/">their transfer ban will be reduced</a> after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> avoided a similar punishment in August, reports say.</p>
      <p>Blues lawyers are in Switzerland to attend a Court of Arbitration for Sport hearing on Wednesday which will listen to arguments suggesting Chelsea’s two-window transfer ban should be reduced.</p>
      <p>Chelsea <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/20/chelsea-transfer-ban-long-will-last-appealing-9615359/">were found guilty of 150 rules breaches of FIFA regulations in the recruitment of 69 academy players</a>, paying a £460,000 fine.</p>
      <p>That ruling was in April and the <a href="https://theathletic.com/1382138/2019/11/19/chelsea-hopeful-over-transfer-ban-appeal-but-with-lampards-youth-policy-in-full-flow-would-it-be-a-disaster-if-it-failed/">Athletic</a> explained the subsequent case in August against City will be a key tool in Chelsea’s appeal.</p>

      <p>City <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/13/man-city-avoided-transfer-ban-breaching-fifa-rules-18-signings-10565135/">avoided a transfer ban by accepting the charges</a>, paying a fine of £315,000 for breaches involving cross-border transfers.</p>
      <p>The leniency for an admission of guilt is new addition to FIFA’s disciplinary code and Chelsea will argue they should have been afforded the same opportunity as City.</p>

      <p>Chelsea are also expected to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/22/chelsea-appeal-fifa-transfer-ban-insist-nothing-wrong-8712123/">revisit the arguments they made in their defence earlier this year</a> by challenging what ‘constitutes a trialist and what qualifies as organised football’.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard has begun his reign as Chelsea boss without the ability to sign any new players and has had to rely on academy stars, as well as the squad from the 2018/19 season.</p>
      <p>Mason Mount, Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori have all become first-team stars in recent months, but Chelsea are hopeful they will be able to sign new players in January.</p>
      <p>Chelsea have been linked with the likes of Borussia Dortmund star Jadon Sancho, while Olivier Giroud and Willian are being mooted as potential departures.</p>
