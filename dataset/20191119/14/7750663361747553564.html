      <p>Both players scored goals during what was an entertaining affair in Israel, with Messi netting an injury time penalty to rescue a draw for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lionel-scaloni/"><b>Lionel Scaloni</b></a>'s side.</p>
      <p>A scuffle between the two started after a nasty tackle on the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/"><b>Barcelona</b></a> star and continued when the players went down the tunnel.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Ole</i>, the PSG striker was seen offering a fight to Messi, who in turn told Cavani that they could fight "whenever you want".</p>
      <p>Messi was also recently involved in a touchline spat with Brazil manager Tite, telling the latter to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/brazil/news/silva-messi-should-show-more-respect_379666.html?t1573935502">"shut up"</a> during a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/argentina/result/result-lionel-messi-returns-as-argentina-defeat-brazil-in-saudi-arabia_379140.html">1-0 win</a> for Argentina in Riyadh.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old returned to international action this month after serving a three-month ban for accusing the CONMEBOL of corruption.</p>
