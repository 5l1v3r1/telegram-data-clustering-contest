      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> and Jeremy Corbyn will go head-to-head tonight in the first ever televised debate between the two main candidates to be British Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>Labour see it as a major opportunity for Mr Corbyn to gain momentum in the General Election campaign and gain ground on the Conservatives, who are <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/tories-surge-ahead-election-polls-ahead-tv-debate-11179542/">leading in the polls</a>, while the Prime Minister will be hoping that a strong performance can help him secure a majority.</p>
      <p>Julie Etchingham will host the live debate in front of a studio audience of around 200 people – and likely millions at home, with questions coming in from viewers.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson will want to talk about his plans for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a>, anti-Semitism in the Labour party and the economic impact of Mr Corbyn’s spending plans. The Labour leader, meanwhile, will be keen for the conversation to cover topics like austerity, the NHS, Mr Johnson’s personal life and his links to President <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>.</p>

      <p>Viewers will be expecting to hear ‘for the many not the few’ and ‘get Brexit done’, among other catch phrases.</p>

      <p>ITV will stand the pair behind podiums, in the first of a long series of debates before the December 12 vote.</p>
      <p>On Friday, a BBC Question Time programme will see Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn joined by Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party leaders Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon, who yesterday <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/lib-dems-snp-wont-included-election-tv-debates-losing-high-court-challenge-11177368/">lost a High Court battle to allow them to take part tonight</a>.</p>
      <p>But they will be given other opportunities to speak to the nation, with Ms Swinson appearing in a three-way debate on Sky News on November 28.</p>
      <p>The next day, she will be joined on the BBC by Ms Sturgeon and the leaders of the Brexit Party, Plaid Cymru and Greens – Nigel Farage, Adam Price and Jonathan Bartley/Sian Berry. It is unclear if Mr Johnson or Mr Corbyn will take part.</p>
      <p>On December 1, ITV are planning another seven-way debate.</p>
      <p>The Labour and Conservative leaders will then have another one-on-one clash on December 6 on BBC One, before a final Question Times special on December 9, featuring ‘leading figures from each of the main parties’.</p>

      <p>At the 2017 election, there were no head-to-head debate between the main party leaders.</p>
      <p>But TV debates have had a significant impact on the campaign in previous elections. In the first, in 2010, the ‘I agree with Nick (Clegg)’ fad was aided by the Lib Dem leader’s performances, while in 2015 Labour’s Ed Miliband appeared to trip off stage.</p>
      <p>This time around, Mr Johnson is being coached by American media strategist Brett O’Donnell, who worked with former President George W Bush, before helping the Prime Minister during the EU referendum debates, according to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/908fac4e-098b-11ea-800a-ac7a27c0f5a9">The Times</a>.</p>
      <p>Allies of Mr Corbyn told the paper that the Labour leader was not being coached by external gurus.</p>
      <p>After the debate, there will be a snap YouGov poll on who the public felt won, though spinners on both sides will almost certainly say their candidate was victorious.</p>
      <p>The debate will air live on ITV 1 tonight at 8pm.</p>
      <p>Then, at 10pm, another live hour-long programme will allow the other party leaders to give their views on the debate.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson, Ms Sturgeon, Mr Farage and Ms Berry will be interviewed individually in consecutive face-to-face interviews with Nina Hossain in London.</p>
