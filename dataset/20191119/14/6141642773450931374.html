      <p>A woman who has fostered more than 250 children over five decades said the Duke of Cambridge was shocked to learn of how many children she has helped.</p>
      <p>Christine Lunn, 74, from North Anston, South Yorkshire, received an MBE for her services to fostering from the duke at a royal investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Mrs Lunn has fostered the hundreds of children since 1975 in Rotherham.</p>
      <blockquote>I love children and making a difference to other children's lives. It's just what I'm meant to do<cite>Christine Lunn</cite></blockquote>
      <p>She said she was surprised and proud to receive the honour.</p>
      <p>“He (the duke) said he can’t believe I’ve looked after so many children and said he doesn’t know how I’ve done it,” she told the PA news agency after receiving her MBE.</p>
      <p>“I can’t imagine doing anything else.”</p>
      <p>Her husband Peter, who died in 2017, supported her in her fostering and helped raise her own children.</p>
      <p>The 74-year-old continues to foster and has vowed to “go on as long as I possibly can”.</p>
      <p>“I love children and making a difference to other children’s lives,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It’s just what I’m meant to do.”</p>
