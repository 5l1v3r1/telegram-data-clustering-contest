      <p>She then has to put her hands into a transparent box, which is also filled with snakes, and retrieve the two stars screwed down.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn has to unscrew the stars while trying not to aggravate the snakes.</p>
      <p>In the clip, Andrew Maxwell tells Caitlyn: "The short end [of the screw] is so much easier. Keep going, keep going, keep going.</p>
      <p>"You have to keep screwing, there's a lot more screw to it."</p>

      <p>Kate and Caitlyn were strapped down inside transparent boxes, which were then lifted in the air.</p>
      <p>They had to chuck a ball into a moving bucket below them and had 10 minutes to try and get as many as they could.</p>
      <p>The pair were joined by a number of critters in the box as well as rats.</p>

      <p>They managed to get two balls each into the buckets, meaning they had four meals in total.</p>
