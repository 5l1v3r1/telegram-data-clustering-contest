      <p>New Zealand’s Key Assets Are Not for Sale: National Interest Test Delivered</p>
      <p>Today the Government announced the delivery of the promise to protect New Zealand interests by applying a new National Interest Test to the sales of our most sensitive and high risk assets to overseas buyers.</p>
      <p>This further strengthening of the Overseas Investment Act will deliver a major Coalition commitment agreement between New Zealand First and Labour.</p>
      <p>New Zealand First called for a National Interest Test to ensure that sales of these assets to overseas companies will benefit New Zealand.</p>
      <p>There has been an alarming trend of our nation’s key strategic assets being sold overseas said New Zealand First’s spokesperson for Primary Industries Mark Patterson MP.</p>
      <p>“We’ve already stopped offshore purchases of our residential homes and restricted the sale of farms, so let’s keep key strategic Kiwi assets in Kiwi hands.</p>
      <p>“The National Interest Test will treat the sale and retention of key strategic assets much more seriously.</p>
      <p>“The sad sale of Westland Milk Products to a Chinese company proved the need for a national interest test as part of the overseas investment office process so we can counter foreign companies forking out cash to get their way.</p>
      <p>“We need to balance the short-term gains of the sale of assets overseas against the long-term benefits for the country and the National Interest Test will help us do so,” said Mr Patterson.</p>
      <p>Under the new test, any investment ordinarily screened under the Act and found contrary to New Zealand’s national interest could be declined.</p>
      <p>New Zealand’s economic, security, and other interests would be considered when deciding this. This is a ‘backstop’ tool, to be used rarely, and it does not represent any change in New Zealand’s openness to high quality foreign investment.</p>
