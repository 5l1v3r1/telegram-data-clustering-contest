      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 19 — Palm oil producers will set up a joint fund to counter critics of the industry, a Malaysian government official said today, amid growing scrutiny of a commodity which is accused of causing widespread environmental damage.</p>
      <p>The cultivation of palm oil, which is used in everything from ice cream to lipstick, is blamed for mass deforestation in South-east Asia and endangering wildlife such as orang-utans and pygmy elephants.</p>
      <p>Tan Yew Chong, secretary-general of the Malaysian ministry of primary industries which oversees palm oil production, told a conference that the new fund will be run by the Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries (CPOPC), an industry body set up by major producers Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
      <p>“We want to go big on that (the fund) to overcome the anti-palm oil issue,” Tan said at the industry conference in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital.</p>
      <p>The fund will implement a new communication and public relations strategy for the industry, among others measures, he said.</p>
      <p>Palm oil has come under particular scrutiny this year as the European Union has launched efforts to introduce a law to limit the use of the vegetable oil in biodiesel.</p>
      <p>The bloc enacted a law this year to phase out palm oil from renewable fuel by 2030 because of the commodity’s links to deforestation. It is also discussing increasing regulations on food — the palm oil industry’s main source of revenue.</p>
      <p>Malaysia, the second biggest producer of palm oil, this year launched a global public relations and lobbying effort to boost the image of palm oil, especially in Europe, Reuters reported.</p>
      <p>The campaign is propagated by platforms which say they represent small-scale farmers but is created and run by public relations firms hired by a government agency responsible for promoting palm oil.</p>
      <p>Indonesia and Malaysia have been increasing biodiesel usage domestically to boost consumption of palm oil.</p>
      <p>Malaysia increased the proportion of palm oil used in biodiesel to 10 per cent from 7 per cent last December, and aims to implement a ‘B20’ programme with 20 per cent palm oil content next year.</p>
      <p>Tan, the government official, said that Malaysia would start implementing the B20 programme in stages from early next year, and will aim to introduce B30 in a few years. — Reuters</p>
