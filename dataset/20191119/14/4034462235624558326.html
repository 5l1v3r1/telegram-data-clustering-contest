      <h1>2020 Alfa Romeo Giulia And Stelvio Are Sexier Than Ever</h1>
      <h2>A mid-life refresh for both is very much welcomed.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:00:02+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>Having arrived for the 2016 and 2017 model years, the Alfa Romeo Giulia and Stelvio have both received a mid-life refresh for the 2020 model year. Debuting at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show, the sedan and SUV retain their sexy Italian styling and excellent performance, though Alfa Romeo has made enhancements to both the interior and exterior. These updates include the standard Giulia and Stelvio as well as their high-performance counterparts, the Giulia Quadrifoglio and Stelvio Quadrifoglio.</p>
      <p>The freshened exterior styling offers an optional body-color appearance kit with fender flares, side sills, and a rear fascia. Sport models receive a new Dark Miron appearance kit with the same unique add-ons as above only in a dark-painted finish. Buyers can also opt for a slick carbon fiber package that includes a V-Scudetto grille, mirror caps, and Dark Minon badging for the Quadrifoglio models. New exterior colors for both the Giulia and Stelvio are Anodized Blue, Lunare White, and Verde Visconti, the latter being offered for the first time on the Giulia.</p>

      <p>Step inside the cabin and you'll notice a new center console with an updated design including a machined-knurled aluminum-look rotary dial, upgraded knob materials, and improved storage. There's also a new race-inspired steering wheel, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and an Italian flag badge at the base of the shifter. And because Americans demand them, larger cupholders.</p>
      <p>A new phone storage area with optional wireless charging is another welcomed feature. The 8.8-inch new touchscreen has improved performance thanks to an updated layout with additional personalization options.</p>

      <p>There are even newly added performance pages enabling drivers to monitor their track performance. Front seat passengers can also customize the screen's homepage with reconfigurable widgets and unique layouts. Driver's benefit from a redesigned 7-inch gauge cluster with an improved format. It's also been designed to incorporate Level 2 autonomous driving functions such as controlled acceleration, braking, and steering. Safety tech like highway assist and traffic jam assist systems are also new, as is full speed forward collision warning plus. A Wi-Fi hotspot and a mobile App with remote operations are among the standard and optional connectivity features.</p>
      <p>No changes appear to take place under the hood. The 2.9-liter twin-turbocharged, Ferrari-derived V6 with 505 horsepower remains for the Giulia and Stelvio Quadrifoglios while the 2.0-liter turbo does duty for lower trims.</p>
      <p>Pricing, including destination, begins at $40,640 and $42,640 for the Giulia and Stelvio, respectively, and $76,040 and $82,040 for the Giulia Quadrifoglio and Stelvio Quadrifoglio.</p>
