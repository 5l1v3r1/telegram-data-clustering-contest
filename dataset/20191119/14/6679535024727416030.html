      <p>The Department of Land Survey has conducted one day training programme for forest personnel in the district on land survey and measurement of boundaries to help them prevent encroachments on forest lands.</p>
      <p>As the personnel had no basic knowledge on land survey and measurement of lands and boundaries, Kandasamy, Assistant Director, Land Survey, and his team conducted the training for about 50 forest personnel, including forest range officers, foresters and forest watchers here on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>T. K. Ashok Kumar, Wildlife Warden, Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park, said the training was organised mainly to educate the foresters to protect forest lands from encroachments. The training programme was organised to help forest personnel measure the boundaries of the forest land and check the boundaries of nearby lands, he said.</p>
      <p>The officials explained about village maps, the Field Measurement Book (FMB) and different types of boundary stones in the morning session. In the afternoon session, the forest personnel took practical training and measured land boundaries, near the helipad at the Collectorate complex, he said.</p>
      <p>S. Sathish, Forest Range officer (Ramanathapuram) organised the programme. District forest officer Arun Kumar and Assistant Conservation of Forest Ganesalingam were present in the training programme.</p>
