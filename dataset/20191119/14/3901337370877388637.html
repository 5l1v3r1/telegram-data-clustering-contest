      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo might be celebrating his 35th birthday in February, but an incredible statistic has emerged showing that the Portugal superstar is seemingly getting better with age.</p>

      <p>Ronaldo scored four times during Portugal's two most recent 2020 UEFA European Championship qualifiers, against Lithuania and Luxembourg, to take his overall international tally to 99 goals.</p>
      <p>The Juventus star, who turns 35 next year, is now just 10 strikes shy of former Iran forward Ali Daei's all-time international record of 109 goals.</p>
      <p>Despite nearing the perceived back end of his career, an incredible statistic has emerged that shows Ronaldo has been more prolific for Portugal since turning 30 than he was in his supposed prime.</p>

      <p>According to <i>GiveMeSport</i>, the former Manchester United star has scored 46 goals in 45 international appearances since turning 30, at a rate better than a goal per game, as opposed to the 53 goals he scored in his previous 119 appearances.</p>
      <p>If he maintains his current goalscoring rate, and assuming he features in Portugal's friendlies ahead of the Euro 2020, Ronaldo could break Daei's record at the tournament next year.</p>

      <p>In June, Ronaldo became the first player to score in 10 consecutive international tournaments when he scored in the inaugural UEFA Nations League competition, and he also holds the world record for the most different teams scored against, having netted against 41 unique nations since his debut in 2003.</p>
