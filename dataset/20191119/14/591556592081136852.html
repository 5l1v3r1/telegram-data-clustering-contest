      <h4>WiFi Pineapple for $200 </h4>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The WiFi Pineapple is a popular rogue access point and Wi-Fi pentest toolkit that can be used to monitor and seek out devices that are misconfigured or vulnerable to attack. It is possible to use the Pineapple to perform Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks, to harvest credentials -- including WPA credentials in cap, hashcat, JTR, and plaintext formats -- as well as to passively monitor networking activity around the user. A smaller, pocket-sized option is also available. </p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The TV-B-Gone is not a serious hacking tool but still could provide a mischievous user with entertainment. Once assembled and soldered, the gadget can be used to prank others by turning off television sets through two narrow-beam IR LEDs and two wide-beam IR LEDs. TVs susceptible include those made by Acer, Fujitsu, Toshiba, and Sony, among many others. </p>

      <p>An interesting concept for a Christmas gift this year is a hacker puzzle. You specify the name of the recipient and the message you want to send, and the team over at Hacker.gifts creates a set of programming puzzles -- one leading to the next -- until this content is revealed. The puzzle is sent as a digital file that can be forwarded directly or printed. </p>
