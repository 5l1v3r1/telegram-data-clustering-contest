      <p>Now cops have confirmed that a body has been found as part of their efforts.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the force said: "Police in East Dunbartonshire can confirm a body has been found in the search for missing woman Helen Maider in the Bishopbriggs area.</p>
      <p>"The 89-year-old was last seen around 6am on Tuesday, 19 November, 2019 at the junction of Balmuildy Road and Stirling Drive.</p>
      <p>"Formal identification has yet to be carried out however her family has been informed and the death is not being treated as suspicious".</p>
      <p>Temperatures across Scotland plummeted overnight - with the mercury dipping to as low <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4964793/scotland-weather-freezing-fog-london/">as -9C in parts of the Highlands and north east.</a></p>
