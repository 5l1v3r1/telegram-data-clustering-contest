      <h1>Phil Spencer says they want more RPGs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:57:27+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:57</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kountouras</a></address>
      <p>During the Microsoft’s X019 in London, Phil Spencer talked to Xbox On about role-playing games.  He said that first and third person shooters are going strong but it’s nice to have games like <i>The Outer Worlds</i> and <i>Wasterland</i>. He also said that they are focusing on the specific genre.</p>
      <blockquote>“Obviously first-person and third-person shooters have been strong, but it’s nice with <i>Outer Worlds</i> coming out, <i>Wasteland</i>… I think RPG is an area that we purposefully focused on and wanted to do more.”</blockquote>
      <p>So it seems like Microsoft will be announcing more role-playing games in the near future, which is nice. Sadly, we do not get many good RPGs these days, quite the opposite to be frank. So if <i>The Outer Worlds</i> is their first attempt, then I am actually a tiny bit excited.</p>
      <blockquote>“One of the things that I’m really proud of that I see now is how RPGs are stepping up for us. Back in the day, when I think Mass Effect 1 which I worked on, Jade Empire, Fable… I remember we really staked out RPGs as something that was important.”</blockquote>
      <p>I just hope they will draw inspiration from good RPG games, like the <i>Mass Effect</i> mentioned above. The <i>Mass Effect</i> trilogy was great and yes I know, the third installment wasn’t the best, but still light years better from <i>Andromeda</i>.</p>
