      <h1>Martin Lewis' parking fine warning to drivers that could save them money</h1>
      <h2>He's spoken out about private fines on This Morning</h2>

      <p>Private parking fines can leave many motorists scratching their heads over whether to pay up or dispute.</p>
      <p>But Martin Lewis has given his advice - and says it could help motorists save some cash.</p>
      <p>The Money Saving Expert spoke about the topic on an episode of This Morning, according to <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/money-saving/martin-lewis-advice-parking-fine-17278896">the MEN</a> .</p>
      <p>A caller rang into the ITV programme to ask Martin for his advice.</p>
      <p>She said: "I've had a parking ticket sent to me in the post from a private company, my dad said that he'd heard that as it's private I don't have to pay it."</p>

      <p>The caller added: "Please can you give me some advice?"</p>
      <p>Martin replied, as usual, with some stellar advice, saying: "That's incorrect information.</p>
      <p>"We did it on this show a few years ago, someone mis-heard, did a Facebook post about it that was then shared 300,000 times - and I've been trying to correct this one ever since."</p>
      <p>He continued: "Private parking tickets are invoices. So if they're unfair invoices you don't have to pay them.</p>
      <p>"But I would always inform them that you believe they're unfair, if they have an appeals system go back through the appeals system.</p>
      <p>"If they don't, write back and say it's unfair, and why you think it is."</p>
      <p>If you do think you've been issued an unfair fine, one thing you shouldn't do is ignore it, as Martin advised: "I would not ignore them, and I have never taken that stance."</p>
