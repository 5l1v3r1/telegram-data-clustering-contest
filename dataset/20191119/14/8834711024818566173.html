      <h1>Fees Must Fall Activist Kanya Cekeshe’s Mental Health Taking Strain – Lawyer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:24:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/neelket/" target="_blank">NT Editor</a></address>
      <p>The lawyer representing Fees Must Fall activist Kanya Cekeshe on Tuesday said his mental health had gotten worse.</p>
      <p>Cekeshe was released from hospital on Sunday night after being admitted for mental health issues.</p>
      <p>The student activist was convicted of public violence and malicious damage to property for trying to set alight a police van during student protests in 2016 and sentenced to eight years in prison. He recently lost his bid to appeal that conviction and sentence.</p>
      <p>His lawyers argued that there was insufficient evidence against him despite his conviction.</p>
      <p>Cekeshe’s lawyer Wikus Steyl said he didn’t get the help he needed from medical practitioners.</p>
      <p>“There was no attack on him. For the last couple of weeks, his mental health has taken a tremendous strain and he’s going from bad to worse every day,” Steyl said.</p>
