      <h1>How Bristol City's summer sales are faring at the likes of Cardiff City and AFC Bournemouth</h1>
      <h2>Adam Webster and Lloyd Kelly were two first team players to leave Ashton Gate this summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:01:40+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:01</time> by <a rel="author">Max Baker</a></address>
      <p>Bristol City sold some big names this summer.</p>
      <p>Although the Robins received significant fees for Adam Webster and Lloyd Kelly, they were tough departures to deal with, given their quality with he former unquestionably one of the best players in the Championship last season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/emotionally-unstable-what-bristol-city-3190666">Former captain and midfield stalwart Marlon Pack</a> was a surprise departure to Cardiff City, while forward Mo Eisa left for regular first-team football in League One with Peterborough.</p>
      <p>The departures have had mixed fortunes, with Eisa lighting up League One and Kelly yet to make a Premier League appearance. Here is how the players who left <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/lee-johnsons-tinkering-works-bristol-3548591">City</a> this summer have fared.</p>
      <h3>Lloyd Kelly</h3>
      <p><b>Signed for: </b>AFC Bournemouth (£15m+)</p>

      <p>It's been a tough start to the season for the young defender.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old is yet to make his Premier League debut for Bournemouth since his summer switch and has been kept out of the side by injury and the form of other defenders.</p>
      <p>Kelly picked up an ankle injury after a stellar pre-season with the Cherries which kept him out until September. He made his solitary Bournemouth appearance at left-back in the Carabao Cup against Burton Albion, completing 90 minutes in a 2-0 loss.</p>
      <p>Since he regained fitness, it has been the form of Spaniard Diego Rico which has kept Kelly out of the side.</p>
      <p>However, manager Eddie Howe is confident Kelly will get his chance.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/18044703.hes-good-place---howe-insists-lloyd-kelly-shown-very-good-professionalism-spell-afc-bournemouth-side/">He told the Bournemouth Echo</a>: "He’ll get an opportunity to show how good he is.</p>
      <p>“The beauty of Lloyd is he can play different positions. He’s got a versatility about him, which gives him more chance to play.</p>
      <p>“But he’s in a very good place. He’s shown very good professionalism, wants to learn all the time, stays out, he’s one of the last off the training pitch every day so I think he’s going to have a great career.”</p>
      <h3>Adam Webster</h3>
      <p><b>Signed for:</b> Brighton and Hove Albion (£20m)</p>

      </figure>
      <p>City's record departure has enjoyed a good start to the season for Brighton.</p>
      <p>He has featured eight times for the Seagulls so far, keeping three clean sheets. Webster has been good in the air, winning an average of 2.8 aerial duels per game, and has a solid passing accuracy of 85.6 per cent.</p>
      <p>After continuing his fine City form on the south coast, Webster picked up an injury in the game against Norwich on November 2 and was stretchered off.</p>
      <p>He missed the 3-1 loss to Manchester United and it is reported that he could be out until Christmas. Brighton boss Graham Potter <a href="https://www.brightonandhoveindependent.co.uk/sport/football/albion/brighton-defender-to-miss-manchester-united-clash-with-ankle-ligament-injury-1-9135249">told the Brighton and Hove independen</a>t: " I don’t like a timescale on it but around that. Sometimes with ligaments, you can be talking months.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully it is weeks but we don’t like to lose anybody.”</p>
      <p>Brighton currently occupy 11th spot in the Premier League.</p>

      <p>City's former captain split opinion when he left Ashton Gate this summer; some were sad to see him leave due to his six years of service while others were comfortable with his departure, given his advancing years, and the arrival of replacement Adam Nagy.</p>
      <p>Pack has had a mixed season for the Bluebirds, getting off to a slow start and struggling against the likes of Leeds United and Luton, but had an upturn in form after the first month of Championship action, with good performances in the win against QPR (in which he scored) and against Millwall in September.</p>
      <p>He has been a popular choice in the Cardiff midfield, playing in 10 of Cardiff's 16 Championship games following his August move.</p>
      <p>Overall, Cardiff have so far struggled this season, finding themselves in 14th place, and Pack will be keen to impress new boss Neil Harris after Neil Warnock's departure.</p>
      <h3>Mo Eisa</h3>
      <p><b>Signed for: </b>Peterborough (£1.75m)</p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-move-15m-signing-3476163">Mo Eisa has flourished since leaving Ashton Gate.</a>
      </p>
      <p>The forward finds himself joint top of the League One scoring charts, tied on 12 goals with fellow <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/league-one-club-name-hefty-3541833">Posh striker Ivan Toney.</a></p>
      <p>Eisa had a torrid time in Bristol, managing just five substitute appearances before being shipped out to League One.</p>
      <p>He has averaged a goal every 1.4 games in the league, with his standout performance being in the 3-2 over Wimbledon in September, in which he scored two goals and assisted the other.</p>
      <p>City fans will be wondering why Eisa couldn't show this kind of form at Ashton Gate.</p>
      <p>Posh boss Darren Ferguson has been delighted with Eisa and said ever a hard fought draw against Coventry: "I’ve worked with top strikers and some fine finishers and Mo is right up there alongside the best, certainly as a finisher."</p>
      <p>Peterborough currently occupy fourth spot in League One, five points off the automatic promotion places.</p>
