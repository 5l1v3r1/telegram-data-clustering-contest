        <b>In anticipation of this week’s 1150th edition of Soccer Laduma, we preview some of the features included. The latest edition will be available at your nearest outlet tomorrow, Wednesday 20th November.</b>

      <p>
        <b>TKO Semi-finals Preview</b>
      </p>
      <p>In our TKO semi-final preview special, we caught with Mamelodi Sundowns defender, Motjeka Madisha, Golden Arrows left-back, Danny Phiri, Kaizer Chiefs legend, William Shongwe, and Maritzburg United forward, Gabriel Nyoni. Once the semi-final matches commence, this weekend is bound to spark into life. Find out the thoughts of the players who desire silverware and one who has been there and has done it before.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wedson Nyirenda Interview</b>
      </p>
      <p>Current Baroka FC head coach and former Kaizer Chiefs forward, Wedson Nyirenda, has bags of coaching experience across the continent, which has served him well, for the most part. However, despite his reputation as a mentor who can make teams punch above their weight, life in Polokwane this season, hasn’t been as rosy as before. And with rumours surfacing of a possible return to coach his native Zambia, is it the end for Nyirenda at Bakgaga?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Thulani Hlatshwayo Interview</b>
      </p>
      <p>Captain of club and country, Thulani Hlatshwayo was the talk of the football fraternity not too long ago, with him expressing his desire to play for Orlando Pirates. Despite this, the move failed to materialize, with ‘Tyson’, as he is affectionately known, extending his contract with the Bidvest Wits and enjoying life and football in Braamfontein. Hlatshwayo opened up about the Orlando Pirates saga and life under new Bafana Bafana head coach, Molefe Nsteki.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Aubrey Modiba Interview</b>
      </p>
      <p>SuperSport United winger, Aubrey Modiba, has been one of the country’s standout players, adding goals, assists and consistent performances for both club and country. Although a move to Absa Premiership champions, Mamelodi Sundowns, didn’t materialize during the last transfer window, regular Bafana Bafana call-ups and winning the MTN8, has certainly put Modiba is in a great space in his career. Hopefully, his ambition to play abroad materializes, however, the left-footed player is firmly focused on his football in Matsatsantsa. </p>

      <p>
        <b>Barcelona feature</b>
      </p>
      <p>Current Barcelona manager, Ernesto Valverde, hasn’t really been taken to, by the Barcelona fan-base and his relationship with Lionel Messi hasn’t always been perfect. It’s clear that the Catalans have relied heavily on their talisman for results, and accusations that Valverde’s team is essentially a one-man show, have failed to dissipate. Soccer Laduma’s Kurt Buckerfield digs deeper to find out the real problem behind Barcelona’s ‘Messi’ reliance.</p>
      <p>
