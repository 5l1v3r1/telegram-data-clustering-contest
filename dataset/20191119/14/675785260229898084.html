      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:24:40+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:24</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/walt-disney-world">Walt Disney World</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/universal-studios-inc">Universal Studios</a> in Orlando are on most people's bucket lists, but they're not exactly the cheapest of getaways.</p>
      <p>But now, adults can bag tickets to both resorts for the same price as kids' tickets - and it could make for some very tempting savings.</p>
      <p>That's because Attraction Tickets Direct has brought back its popular 'Adults pay kids prices' deal for theme parks including Walt Disney World and Universal.</p>
      <p>The best part is that there's a wide variety of ticket options included as part of the offer, whether you're after a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.attraction-tickets-direct.co.uk%2Forlando-attraction-tickets%2Fwalt-disney-world-resort%2Fdisneys-14-day-ultimate-ticket&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Ftravel%2Fusa-canada%2Fadults-can-pay-kids-prices-20914918">14 Day Ultimate Ticket</a> to Disney or a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.attraction-tickets-direct.co.uk%2Forlando-attraction-tickets%2Funiversal-orlando-resort%2Funiversal-orlando-3-park-explorer-ticket&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Ftravel%2Fusa-canada%2Fadults-can-pay-kids-prices-20914918">3-park ticket</a> to Universal Orlando.</p>
      <p>Oh, and there are even <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.attraction-tickets-direct.co.uk%2Forlando-attraction-tickets%2Forlando-combination-ticket-packages%2Fdisney-universal-combo-ticket&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Ftravel%2Fusa-canada%2Fadults-can-pay-kids-prices-20914918">combination tickets to both resorts</a> if you're planning to explore a whole host of the parks.</p>
      <p>There's more good news too as the deals are valid for trips in both 2019 and 2020, ideal if you've been thinking of a last minute trip or you're looking to plan ahead for next year.</p>
