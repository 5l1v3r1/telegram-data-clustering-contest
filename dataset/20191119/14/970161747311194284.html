      <p>Emily Atack has taken aim at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/katie-price/">Katie Price</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/peter-andre/">Peter Andre</a> as she joked about the first time they ‘fondled’ in the I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! pool.</p>
      <p>When appearing on the competition’s sister show Extra Camp, the 29-year-old watched her co-hosts Joel Dommett and Adam Thomas take a dip in the iconic lake.</p>
      <p>However, she didn’t seem too impressed when she was reminded about Katie and Peter’s smooch in the water, when they fell in love on the show back in 2004.</p>

      <p>‘This is where Katie Price and Peter Andre had fondles,’ Joel proudly boasted to his buddy.</p>
      <p>But back in the studio, Emily teased: ‘I hope you boys went to the clinic after being in that pool.’</p>
      <p>Looking slightly lost for words, her new presenting pal quickly rose to the banter, as he named one of Pete’s songs, drum roll, please!</p>

      <p>‘Oh yeah, we did,’ he told the former I’m A Celeb contestant: ‘And we tested positive for Insania.’</p>
      <p>Emily giggled behind her flashcard at the joke as Joel showed there were no hard feelings by adding: ‘Love you, Peter.’</p>
      <p>The ITV hit appears to be pushing the boundaries this year with their sly comments, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/ant-dec-open-im-celebrity-hilarious-prince-andrew-sweat-dig-11172692/">seeing Ant and Dec take aim at Prince Andrew in the opening sequence.</a></p>
      <p>When welcoming their fans back to the show, they made reference to the royal’s claim that he has a ‘peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat.’</p>

      <p>Ant chuckled: ‘10 celebrities, all of them very nervous, all of them sweating.’</p>
      <p>‘Presuming they can sweat, not everyone can,’ Dec added with a cheeky smirk on his face.</p>
      <p>Never ones to turn down a chance to milk a joke, the pair returned to the sweating puns, with Dec asking about the second team of celebs to arrive in the jungle.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Will those celebrities be A) confident, B) excited, or C) absolutely sweating?’ Dec asked, with his pal jumping in: ‘Presuming they can sweat.’</p>
      <p>‘Presuming they can,’ Dec repeated: ‘Not everybody can.’</p>
