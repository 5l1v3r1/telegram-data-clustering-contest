      <p>After more than 100 days of restrictions followed by abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, life in the Valley is crawling back to being normal.</p>
      <p>Shops at Lal Chowk in Kashmir remained opened and busy Shutters remained up for the whole day on Tuesday there unlike what it was recently when the shops would remained opened only for a few hours in a day.</p>
      <p>Shopkeepers kept the shutter locked in the past to protest against the abrogation of Article 370 in the Valley. <b>"For the past few days, the shops remained closed. The shopkeepers did so to protest but now things are significantly going back to being normal,"</b> Shoeb Mir, a Valley resident, said.</p>
      <p>The restriction in Jammu and Kashmir hit the public transportation the most. When the local transport companies remained shut, it caused a massive trouble to the locals.</p>
      <p>The government had asked Jammu and Kashmir State Road Transport Corporation (J&amp;KSRTC) to keep its buses available on various routes which revived the public transportation but not as a whole.</p>
      <p>Schoolkids were also seen in attending their classes after losing lessons for almost three months. <b>"We were able to sit for our exams. I am happy to go to school again,"</b> a student said. The average attendance stood at 90 per cent.</p>
      <p>The move to scrap the special status of the erstwhile state and its division into two Union Territories (UTs) had left the Valley in a state of shock. The government had deployed lakhs of security forces to curb any form of protest. Widespread restrictions were imposed which included a complete communications blackout.</p>
      <p>However, slowly, most of the restrictions have been relaxed.</p>
