      <p>Aussie telco Mate has been offering NBN plans for a while, and is now moving into the mobile space with affordable monthly rates that should get everyone excited, coming in the next few days.</p>
      <p>The company’s offering month-to-month, contract free terms with some attractive deals. Prices start at just $20/month for 5GB data, with $5 price point steps up to $40/month for 40GB.</p>
      <p>All of Mate’s plans come with unlimited calls/SMS/MMS to standard Australian numbers, and from December if you’re on a plans at or above $25/month you’ll also get unlimited calls to 15 countries (China, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, United Kingdom, USA and Vietnam).</p>
      <p>Mate also offers a “Data Banking” feature that lets you bank unused data and roll it over for latest use as long as you remain connected to one of the company’s plans. (You’ve paid for that data; this is one of our favourite features in 2019). Data Banking also rolls out in December.</p>
      <p>Mate is connecting users to part of Telstra’s mobile network for their service, so the coverage should be on par with similar offerings from Aldi, Woolworths and more.</p>
      <p>Further, since the company also offers home broadband plans over the NBN you can also get a discount for bundling services together.</p>
      <p>Finally, Mate also makes a point of running their customer service team locally in Australia – it’s located in Sydney’s south-west.</p>
      <p>If you’re interested and want to find out more, Mate’s launching on Thursday November 21 so hit up their website – <a href="http://www.letsbemates.com.au/">www.letsbemates.com.au</a> – then to get on board.</p>
