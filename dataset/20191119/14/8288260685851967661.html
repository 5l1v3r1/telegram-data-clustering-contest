      <p>Norwich City have been linked with a move for Aston Villa summer target Jack Butland.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> were believed to be vying with AFC Bournemouth for the England international's services, but both sides ended up going a different route.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth promoted Aaron Ramsdale - signed from Sheffield United in 2017 - to number one and Villa signed <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/tom-heaton">Tom Heaton</a> from Burnley in an £8 million deal.</p>
      <p>Jed Steer stepped up from deputy to Orjan Nyland - who got injured last season - to help guide <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> 's side back to the Premier League through the Championship's play-offs.</p>

      <p>But Smith wanted a new stopper for his side's first campaign back in the top flight after three seasons in the Championship.</p>
      <p>In the end he plumped for Heaton, balking at Stoke City's asking price of north of £20 million for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jack-butland">Butland</a> .</p>
      <p>Butland is now set to be offered an escape route from the bet365 Stadium, report <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/stoke-city-transfer-news-butland-3435776">StokeonTrentLive</a> , with the 26-year-old enduring a torrid few seasons with Mark Hughes, Paul Lambert, Gary Rowett, Nathan Jones and now Michael O'Neill all taking charge of Stoke since the 2017-18 season.</p>
