      <p>As a player beginning to find his stride this season, FC Barcelona star Lionel Messi recently managed to dribble past five Uruguayan players during a match while on International duty. Have you seen it?</p>
      <p>Argentina faced Uruguay in a friendly on Monday night, and the two South American nations treated fans to a goal-laden match in a fiesty 2-2 draw.</p>
      <p>Barca teammates Luis Suarez and Messi both found themselves on the scoresheet, while Manchester City's Sergio Aguero and Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani got among the goals as well.</p>
