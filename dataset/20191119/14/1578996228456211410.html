      <h1>The Crown: The Complicated History Behind Royal Family, the Queen's Secret Documentary</h1>

      <p>Kim, Kourtney, and Khloé reign supreme as the doyennes of reality television, but powerful families were being filmed fly-on-the-wall style across the pond long before the Kardashians entered the conversation in 2007.</p>
      <p>Back in 1969, the British monarchy developed a revolutionary idea to bolster their image in the public eye: an intimate television program following their day-to-day activities. Much like <i>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</i>, the two-hour film showed the royals doing everything from the mundane (small talk over dinner) to the monarchial (the queen meeting with U.S. President Richard Nixon). It was basically reality television before reality television existed.</p>
      <p><i>Royal Family </i>aired in black and white to rave reviews on June 21, 1969, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p021gjxf">drawing in 23 million Britons</a>. Despite its massive success, Queen Elizabeth reportedly shelved it at the end of 1969, and it hasn't been broadcast in full since.</p>
      <p>The documentary—an unprecedented peek into the lives of a family whose subjects perceived them at the time both as extravagant and embarrassing—is central to the plot of season 3 of <i>The Crown</i>. Though the Netflix series has been known to embellish storylines (most recently, producers were <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-crown-fabricates-royal-history">accused</a> of fabricating early Prince Charles-Camilla drama), the complicated history behind <i>Royal Family</i>, depicted in episode 4, is very much real.</p>
      <p>I got ahold of the British Film Institute archivist in charge of <i>Royal Family</i>, non-fiction curator Patrick Russell, who told me it was commissioned by the monarchy in connection with the investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales on July 1, 1969. It was Britain's first-ever coproduction between public television (the BBC) and commercial television (ITV). Led by Richard Cawston, the famed director behind <i>This Is BBC</i> and <i>Eye to Eye,</i> it was filmed in "modern observational documentary style," Russell told me.</p>
      <p>"It follows a year in the life of the royal family, and of the queen in particular, often using lightweight cameras and microphones, technology never previously used to depict Britain's royal family," he said. "It was groundbreaking."</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.historyextra.com/period/20th-century/royal-family-documentary-history-queen-elizabeth-ii/">BBC <i>History</i> </a><i><a href="https://www.historyextra.com/period/20th-century/royal-family-documentary-history-queen-elizabeth-ii/">Magazine</a></i>, <i>Royal Family</i> was shot over 75 days and in 172 locations. Some of the more memorable scenes include the Queen feeding carrots to her horses, and Prince Charles water-skiing. Though unscripted, everything—from lighting to camera angles—was heavily monitored by the family.</p>
      <blockquote>All scenes had to be agreed by a joint BBC-ITV advisory committee chaired by Prince Philip. The Queen—by nature a private person, and one not drawn to change—was at first reluctant but allowed herself to be persuaded, and ironically wound up becoming something of an expert on camera angles.</blockquote>
      <p>Queen Elizabeth was reportedly pleased with the finished product, but had it taken off air and archived at BFI, never to be shown fully in public again. In 1994, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150611004024/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/trying-to-be-useful-twentyfive-years-ago-the-windsors-attempted-to-recreate-their-public-image-using-a-television-film-to-portray-the-royal-family-as-ordinary-hardworking-people-as-this-final-extract-from-a-new-book-on-the-dynasty-shows-it-was-a-ploy-that-went-terribly-wrong-1423599.html"><i>The Independent</i> reported</a> that researchers were charged a fee to access it, and only with express permission from Buckingham Palace. The queen, according to <i>The Independent</i>, retained copyright and was strict about who was allowed to see it. She was especially particular about which scenes could and could not be viewed. For instance, a shot at the dinner table depicting the Queen dipping her finger in Price Charles's salad and remarking "oily!" was off limits.</p>
      <p>This no longer seems to be the case. Russell told me it's currently available for anyone to watch for free as part of the Institute's "in venue offerings" at its <a href="https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/">multimedia library in Southbank</a> in London.</p>
      <p>The television program was clearly a ploy to portray the royal family as accessible, but critics complained it actually hampered the family's mystique. <i>The Independent</i> reports David Attenborough, at the time Controller of BBC 2, thought Cawston had "committed an anthropological mistake."</p>

      <p>"You're killing the monarchy with this film you're making," Attenborough reportedly told Cawston. "The whole institution depends on mystique and the tribal chief in his hut. If any member of the tribe ever sees inside the hut then the whole system of tribal chiefdom is damaged and the tribe eventually disintegrates."</p>
      <p>Some believe it even opened the floodgates to the microscopic lens through which the public and the press now scrutinize the royal family. As Sarah Gristwood, royal affairs expert, wrote for BBC <i>History Magazine</i>: <b>"</b>It is arguable that the film had instead let the genie out of the bottle, so that ever more access would be expected, while the media’s awareness that they had been fed a manipulated image only encouraged them to seek a less censored reality."</p>
