      <h1>New England Patriots rewarded with 'Victory Monday' day off following Eagles revenge win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:28:17+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:28</time> by <a rel="author">Ryan Gaydos</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</a> improved to 9-1 on the season after defeating the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/philadelphia-eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> on Sunday, but that wasn’t exactly the reason why the team was celebrating in the locker room.</p>
      <p>After a hard-fought game that included the Patriots defense sacking <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/carson-wentz">Carson Wentz</a> five times and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tom-brady">Tom Brady</a> failing to throw a touchdown pass, coach Bill Belichick decided to do something extra special for his boys: give them Monday off.</p>

      <p>“You know what I think we’re ready for?” Belichick asked. “I think we’re ready for Victory Monday.”</p>

      <p>Victory Monday means each player gets the day off and won’t have to be back to work until Wednesday.</p>

      <p>Belichick not only got to rile up his players with some good news, he got a kick out of poking fun at the Eagles after their loss – even if the jab comes more than a year after their Super Bowl loss to Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>Eagles offensive lineman Lane Johnson said on the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000915874/article/lane-johnson-patriots-are-a-fearbased-organization">Pardon My Take</a> podcast in February 2018 he believed Patriots players didn’t look like they were having fun playing after the team won their first Super Bowl.</p>
      <p>It appeared that Belichick didn’t forget that one because he delivered a subtle response in the postgame press conference after Sunday's victory.</p>
      <p>“It looked like everyone had fun out there today,” he said in part of his opening statement to the media.</p>
