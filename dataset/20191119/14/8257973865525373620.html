      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Dale_Earnhardt/?tps=1">Dale Earnhardt</a> Jr. will be the honorary starter at the 2020 Daytona 500, meaning the retired NASCAR star will wave the green flag at the beginning of <i>The</i> <i>Great American Race</i>.</p>
      <p>Earnhardt -- who retired after the 2017 season -- announced the honor Monday on his Dirty Mo Media podcast, <i>The Dale Jr. Download</i>. The 2020 Daytona 500 kicks off the season Sunday, Feb. 16 at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Fla. Earnhardt won the race in 2004 and 2014.</p>
      <p>He was the official pace truck driver for the 2019 Daytona 500. Earnhardt, 45, was the grand marshal for the 2018 Daytona 500.</p>
      <p>Daytona International Speedway president Chip Wile joked that the only thing left for Earnhardt to do at the track is sing the national anthem before the race.</p>
      <p>"One thing is certain, I'm not doing any singing at Daytona no matter how hard they ask," <a href="http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Articles/2019/11/Dale-Earnhardt-Jr-Named-Honorary-Starter-for-62nd-Annual-DAYTONA-500.aspx">Earnhardt said in a news release</a>. "But I am going to enjoy waving the green flag in February. The start of the Daytona 500 is a special moment in not only NASCAR, but all of sports. I am truly honored to be part of that."</p>
      <p>Earnhardt now works as an NBC Sports commentator. The 15-time NASCAR Cup Series Most Popular Driver won 17 events at Daytona International Speedway, tied for the third-best total.</p>
