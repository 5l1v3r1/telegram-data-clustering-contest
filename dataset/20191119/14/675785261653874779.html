      <h2>The former Prime Minister also hit out at allegations of Islamophobia</h2>

      <p>Gordon Brown promised Jews “you will never walk alone” as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> battles the ongoing anti-Semitism row.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> ’s election campaign has been marred by revelations over some candidates’ allegedly anti-Semitic social media posts, while the Tories have been hit by claims of Islamophobia.</p>
      <p>Former Prime Minister Mr Brown told a Hope Not Hate dinner: “To those who suffer from Islamophobia, we have got to say - we will never tolerate the intolerable, we will never accept the unacceptable, we will never equivocate on what is unequivocally wrong.</p>
      <p>“To the Jewish community, I believe we have got to say this – you will never walk alone, we will always walk by your side in fighting anti-Semitism.”</p>

      <p>He added: “We can’t just stand up to some forms of discrimination, some forms of prejudice, some forms of bullying, some forms of bigotry and some forms of racism.</p>
      <p>“We must stand up against all forms.”</p>
      <p>Former Labour leader Mr Brown demanded “new laws and new protections against anti-Semitism and against Islamophobia”, adding: “That’s essential for a decent country.”</p>
      <p>In a wide-ranging speech to the anti-fascist campaign group in London, he raised fresh warnings about the UK failing to strike a post-Brexit deal with Brussels before a transition ends in December 2020.</p>
      <p>“It seems to me unlikely that, as present circumstances go, we are going to have anything other than a no-deal <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> ,” he said.</p>
      <p>“That means Britain an evermore intolerant, an evermore introverted, an evermore inward-looking and isolationist country - the opposite of the country we want to be.”</p>
