      <p>Today, <a href="https://news.strategyanalytics.com/press-release/ux-innovation/strategy-analytics-foldable-phones-strong-consumer-desire-when-costs">Strategy Analytics</a> released a report that foldable devices are the long-awaited disruptors in the smartphone market. And early adopters are keen to pursue these new devices. But the acceptance of foldable devices in the mainstream market will depend on the extent to which the current barriers to adoption are addressed. The study found that the price of current foldable devices don’t cover the advantages they bring.</p>

      <p>Particularly, the report shares some noteworthy ideas:</p>
      <p>For most consumers in the UK and the US, the idea of ​​having a larger, portable, large-screen smartphone is valuable. However, the willingness to pay for the foldable device is inconsistent with the desire to purchase the device. Manufacturers must understand that after the cost has dropped, sales are likely to increase.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>However, consumers’ acceptance of traditional smartphone screen sizes continues to increase. But they also want to use them with a single hand. In this sense, the foldable devices have a larger screen when unfolded. Thus, users have to enter text with both hands.</li>
        <li>Use cases need to be fully demonstrated to enable consumers to fully understand and appreciate the potential of foldable devices. Although their focus seems to be on promoting ‘two devices together’, it’s better to provide a video, explaining their advantages. Identifying and promoting meaningful new use cases are critical to success.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to Strategy Analytics, ‘As multitasking will look to be a core selling point for foldable phones, it is imperative that the execution be simplified and intuitive. Our data suggests there are a lot of uncertainties that come with foldable phone ownership, stemming mainly from concerns with durability and size, in addition to concerns over enhanced use cases.’</p>

      <p>‘But our data also shows that when the consumers are able to use a foldable phone in hand, there is a solid reduction of doubt and concern about the concept. This means that the in-store experience may more important than ever in driving awareness, capabilities, and potential use cases.’</p>
      <p>Strategy Analytics also added: ‘The big question is whether the perceived value will outweigh the added cost; and the initial response from consumers is ‘no.’ The ability for foldable displays to resolve real consumer pain-points is, in our view critical to whether these devices will become a niche segment of the smartphone market or the dominant form-factor of the future. Until costs come down, these devices will not take off.’</p>
