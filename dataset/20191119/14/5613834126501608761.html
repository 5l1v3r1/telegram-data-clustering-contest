      <p>Here’s a clip from <b>Adam Randall</b>’s (<i>iBoy</i>, <i>Level Up</i>) thriller <b><i>I See You</i></b><i>,</i> which made its World Premiere at the SXSW Film Festival earlier this year. <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3550821/sxsw-review-see-unravels-paranoia-danger-suburbia/">Meagan attended the World Premiere and wrote that the film “unravels paranoia and danger in suburbia.”</a></p>
      <p>Starring Academy Award-winner <b>Helen Hunt</b>, who I will always remember for her role in the disaster epic <i>Twister</i> and Charles Band’s awesome <i>Trancers</i>, and <b>Jon Tenney</b> (<i>Legion</i>, “Major Crimes”), Saban Films will release in limited theaters and on VOD platforms <b>December 6th.</b></p>
      <p><i>I See You</i> takes place in a seemingly perfect town filled with perfect families, until 12-year-old Justin Whitter goes missing. Greg Harper (Tenney), lead investigator, struggles to balance the pressures of the case while finding a way to forgive his well-heeled wife, Jackie (Hunt), for a recent infidelity.  When a malicious presence manifests itself and puts their young son in mortal danger, the cold, hard truth about evil in the Harper household is finally uncovered.</p>
