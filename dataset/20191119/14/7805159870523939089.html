      <h1>Amazon Music expands its free (with ads) music tier to iOS, Android, and Fire TV</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:18:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/joefedewa/" target="_blank">Joe Fedewa</a></address>
      <p>Most music streaming services offer at least two tiers: ad-free paid and ad-supported free. The free tiers are packed with interrupting ads and limitations, but at least you can enjoy music without shelling out for a subscription. Amazon has offered a free version of its Amazon Music service for <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/connected-home/amazon-echo">Amazon Echo</a> owners, but now they are opening it up to everyone.</p>
      <p>Previously restricted to people who bought <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amazon-echo-2019-announcements/">Amazon Echo</a> devices, now the Amazon Music app for Android, iOS, Fire TV, and the web includes the free streaming option. This is available for users in the US, UK, and Germany right now. You do not need an Amazon Prime membership to use the Amazon Music service.</p>
      <p>You get access to the same 2+ million songs in the Amazon library, but with a few ads thrown in. Free users still get access to Amazon Music’s curated playlists as well. Amazon has been slowly opening up its music service over the years, but it still has a long way to go before it can compete with Spotify and Apple Music. If you’re interested in the paid subscription, you can try it now for 4 months of Amazon Music Unlimited for $0.99.</p>
