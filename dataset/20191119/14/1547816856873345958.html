        <b>We love keeping a track of what our celebs wear and their airport fashion really counts! Of late, we have seen several B-Town actresses embrace ethnic wear at the airport and set new style goals</b>
      </p>
      <p>Our celebs set style goals with whatever they choose to wear. Be it at the gym, at a party or even at the airport, they ensure they are dressed to perfection because the paps follow them everywhere.<br/><br/>Now, as we talk about airport fashion, we can’t miss out on how most of these actresses are ditching those comfy track pants, hoodies and instead opting for lovely ethnic pieces as their travel gear!<br/><br/>From the Kapoor siblings- Kareena and Karisma to the star-kids Janhvi Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan, they have been making a style splash in traditional pieces at the airport.<br/>Let’s go through some of their recent airport appearances donning ethnic pieces:<br/><br/>Kareena Kapoor Khan was seen wearing a mustard yellow full-sleeved kurta with matching dupatta and ivory pants. As yellow continues to be in vogue, Bebo shows how you can flaunt the colour through a simple kurta and make it your airport outfit!</p>

      <p>Her elder sister Karisma Kapoor made one of those rare outings dressed in a lovely Anita Dongre ethnic piece at the airport. Her light-weight printed kurta set with breezy palazzo pants and a matching dupatta is totally lit.</p>

      <p>Kriti Sanon’s airport fashion has usually been easy-breezy but this time, she goes for a peach salwar suit at the airport. We love the Chikankari detailing on her kurta and we think, she perfectly shows us how to go relaxed yet traditional with your airport fashion!</p>

      <p>Not the first time of course, Janhvi Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan have turned up in pretty ethnic outfits on several occasions at the airport. In fact, they can be called the trendsetters for bringing good ethnic pieces in vogue.<br/><br/>Yet again, the girls enthrall us with their recent airport outings. Sara Ali Khan was seen donning an ivory kurta set that featured gota patti work and bold stripes in yellow, pink and orange shades. What we loved the most about her look is the fact that she ditched the usual dupatta and chose a long ivory cape.</p>

      <p>Speaking of Janhvi’s airport look, the actress spread some festive cheer at the airport in a breezy blue sharara set. Those flared pants and those long-sleeved ruffle trimmings lent her outfit total celebratory vibes. Oh and those majenta Punjabi jootis, we loved them!</p>
