      <p>Jayceon Taylor declares his Kobe-inspired LP will go #1.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> In 2008, The Game dropped <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/05/Game_lax.jpg"><i>LAX</i>¬†which featured his two sons on the cover</a>. For his latest album, which is due out on November 29,¬†the West Coaster wanted unborn children for the artwork.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Game debuted the <i>Born 2 Rap</i> cover art on his Instagram page. The image shows nine pregnant women in a studio as the emcee writes lyrics on a notepad.</p>
      <p>"The concept behind this photo goes way beyond what you see upon 1st glance &amp; I absolutely cannot wait for all of you to hear the music that goes along with the album," wrote Game in the IG caption.</p>
      <p>He later added, "This album will go #1...... because it‚Äôs CLASSIC!!! &amp; in 11 days you all will get to hear why. I took the liberty in attaching the [tracklisting] as I know you guys have been wondering who‚Äôs on it... 24 tracks because @kobebryant is my [all-time] favorite player &amp; has been a friend &amp; inspiration to my career, so I saw it just to pay homage to the üêê."</p>
      <p>There are some music heavyweights listed as features for <i>Born 2 Rap</i>. Ed Sheeran, Miguel, Travis Barker, Nipsey Hussle, 21 Savage, Bryson Tiller, Anderson .Paak, Chris Brown, Trey Songz, and more acts will show up on the project. Dom Kennedy is listed as both a guest artist and executive producer.</p>
