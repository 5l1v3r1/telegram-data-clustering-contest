        <b>Sarah Sugden (Katie Hill) finds herself in a dangerous situation during an hour long episode of Emmerdale tonight – as she attends a party with her boyfriend Danny (Louis Healey), who gives her a pill, which she then takes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With things tense at home following the split of Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins) and Vanessa Woodfield (Michelle Hardwick), Sarah has been spending more and more time with Danny and enjoying getting close to him. But his peer pressure on her steps up a gear tonight.</p>
      <p>Noah (Jack Downham) is already suspicious of Sarah sneaking off and finds that she has gone to the party. He sees Danny and his mate Jayden with her and when she is offered a pill, she doesn’t want to feel shown up in front of Danny and so takes it.</p>

      <p>Sarah’s health is already vulnerable due to a serious heart condition and Noah is stunned to see what she has done – but what impact will it have and will she take a turn for the worse? With Noah worried about what she is getting herself into, he has to decide whether to involve Charity in it.</p>

      <p>But if Charity wades in and angrily confronts Sarah, will the teenager just dig her heels in and opt to defy her even more? She is clearly extremely taken with Danny but just how dangerous is he – and is this just the beginning of a dark path for the impressionable youngster?</p>
      <p>With Debbie (Charley Webb) still away, Sarah’s care falls to Charity but with everything happening recently with Vanessa, Moses and her fallouts with Cain and Chas, her mind is not properly focused on what Sarah is hiding.</p>
      <p>When she does discover the truth, will it be too little too late?</p>
