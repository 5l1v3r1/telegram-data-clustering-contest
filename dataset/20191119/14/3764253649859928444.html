      <p>Premier League giants Arsenal are reportedly ready to offer German club Borussia Monchengladbach a chance to resign Granit Xhaka when the transfer window opens.</p>
      <p>But the German club will have to give the Gunners their star man Denis Zakaria before luring Granit Xhaka back to Germany.</p>
      <p>Granit Xhaka's days at Arsenal are now numbered after the confrontation he had with Gunners fans at the Emirates stadium in which he failed to apologize.</p>
      <p>He was also stripped of the captaincy at Arsenal after his outburst against Gunners' fans as Unai Emery named Gabon international Pierre Aubameyang as the new captain.</p>

      <p>Xhaka remains fans favorite at Monchengladbach having spent four years there before making the move to the Emirates in 2016.</p>
      <p>The German club will have to enter serious competition with Premier League side Newcastle United <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276065-granit-xhaka-newcastle-united-fabian-schar-land-fellow-countryman.html">who are also interested</a> in signing Granit Xhaka.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are currently occupying sixth position on the Premier League standings with 17 points after 12 games played this season.</p>
      <p>Earlier, <b>Legit.ng</b> had reported how Premier League side Newcastle United are now relying on the help of their star defender Fabian Schar to <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276065-granit-xhaka-newcastle-united-fabian-schar-land-fellow-countryman.html">convince Granit Xhaka to join the club</a> on loan in January 2020.</p>
      <p>Granit Xhaka has been left out of Arsenal squad since the confrontation he had with the Gunners' fans against Crystal Palace when he was being substituted.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old midfielder was angry with the way he was booed by Arsenal fans, and he made some abusive statement angrily while he was leaving the pitch.</p>
