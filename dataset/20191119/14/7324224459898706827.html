      <h1>Donations wanted as Operation Santa launches</h1>
      <h2>A special campaign by a Dudley community organisation has officially launched its 2019 campaign.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:18:32+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/james-vukmirovic/" target="_blank">James Vukmirovic</a></address>
      <p>Operation Santa is organised and run by Dudley Council For Voluntary Service (CVS), the local infrastructure agency supporting the voluntary and community sector in Dudley and working to build caring, vibrant and strong communities.</p>
      <p>They started running the campaign over 40 years ago to collect and distribute presents to families who weren't able to afford presents at Christmas.</p>
      <p>The campaign, which relies entirely on donations from businesses and members of the public, launched its new year with an event at its base within Black Country Radio's offices at the Waterfront in Brierley Hill.</p>

      <p>The Mayor of Dudley Councillor David Stanley and his consort Councillor Anne Millward were present at the event, as were representatives of the radio station and organisations involved in the campaign, such as Hope Centre Halesowen, Top Church Dudley and Dudley Children's Services.</p>
      <p>There were also photo opportunities with Santa Claus, who had his own grotto at the event, the launch of a competition to win a VW Beetle Cabriolet for Â£5 and hot and cold refreshments on offer.</p>
      <p>Eileen Fielding, Volunteer Centre Development Officer at Dudley CVS and organiser of Operation Santa, spoke about what the project provides and how it came to be based at Black Country Radio.</p>
      <p>She said: "In terms of what donations we want, we have a couple of wish lists of things we ideally need and that a child aged 0 to 18 would need, so as well as toys and gifts, we need things like pyjamas, school stationary, school trousers, even food and chocolate.</p>
      <p>"Whatever anyone would need, we collect and distribute anything that a family might need at Christmas.</p>
      <p>"We've always done things with Black Country Radio as they are Dudley CVS's partner for our annual volunteer awards every year, and I had a conversation with Dave Brownhill, co-director of Black Country Radio, last year where I said 'I need somewhere for Christmas next year for Operation Santa' and he said 'Leave it with me'.</p>
      <p>"He suggested talking to Intu, who said that Black Country Radio have an empty room, and the rest is history. We moved in about a month ago and we'll be here until Christmas."</p>
      <p>Operation Santa, which will run until December 24, is looking to surpass the 13,000 donations it received in 2018, with everything donated going to disadvantaged families across Dudley Borough.</p>
