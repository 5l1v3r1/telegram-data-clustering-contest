      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/vinnie-jones/">Vinnie Jones</a> joined Madness live on stage after performing a medley of their hits on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">The X Factor</a>: Celebrity in memory of his late wife Tanya.</p>
      <p>The footballing legend was watching the iconic ska band from the balcony at their show at the Electric Ballroom in Camden when the band invited him up on the stage to give the audience a little sing-song.</p>
      <p>As X Factor viewers will attest to, the X-men star clearly loves a bit of Madness, so was well up for joining lead singer Graham ‘Suggs’ McPherson.</p>

      <p>‘Let’s get Vinnie Jones down!’ the singer said to the audience before the two hugged and danced on stage.</p>
      <p>Vinnie previously tugged at viewers’ heart-strings as he took to the stage <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/vinnie-jones-pays-touching-tribute-to-late-wife-tanya-during-live-the-x-factor-celebrity-performance-11072460/">two weeks ago with a rendition of hits It Must Be Love and House of Fun</a>.</p>
      <p>During his rendition, he tenderly pointed up to the sky and opened his arms out wide.</p>
      <p>The lyrics of the song read: ‘I never thought I’d miss you, half as much as I do, and I never thought I’d feel this way, the way I feel, about you.</p>

      <p>‘As soon as I wake up, every night, every day, I know that it’s you I need.’</p>
      <p>The Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barells star then went straight in to a spirited rendition of another Madness classic; the ska party anthem House of Fun.</p>
      <p>Going from performing a cover to singing with actual Madness in just under two weeks? That’s a flex if ever we saw one.</p>
      <p>However, his time on X Factor hasn’t been plain sailing. This weekend, the 54 year-old<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/kevin-mchale-eliminated-from-the-x-factor-celebrity-as-simon-cowell-refuses-to-let-vinnie-jones-drop-out-11168924/"> attempted to quit the show last weekend</a> when he found himself in the sing-off between former Glee star Kevin McHale.</p>

      <p>‘Simon, I feel like I’ve had a fantastic time, I’ve really enjoyed it. It’s been everything I’ve need since my wife’s passing,’ Vinnie began.</p>
      <p>This guy is a real singer, I think he can win it. For his career, I’d like to step down so that he can go through.’</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, however, Simon Cowell was having absolutely none of it and sent Kevin packing.</p>
      <p>It has been confirmed that when The X Factor: Celebrity returns for its live semi-final this weekend,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/vinnie-jones-confirmed-stay-x-factor-celebrity-trying-quit-simon-cowell-boss-11175520/"> the former midfielder will be participating as a contestant</a>.</p>
