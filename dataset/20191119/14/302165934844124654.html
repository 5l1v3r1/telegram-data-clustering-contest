      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 19 — Janie and Jack partners with designer and entrepreneur Rachel Zoe to launch holiday party collection that gives back</p>
      <p>Fashion designer and stylist Rachel Zoe is getting festive with the childrenswear brand Janie and Jack.</p>
      <p>The duo have teamed up to launch the first installment of a two-part “Rachel Zoe x Janie and Jack” collaboration, beginning with the “Holiday Party Collection”. A second series, featuring resort wear for winter family getaways, is slated for release on December 3.</p>
      <p>Featuring glamorous outfits for both girls and boys, the 38-piece collection spans lurex maxi dresses, metallic cheetah pant suits and velveteen and wool tuxedos. Statement accessories include a metallic turban, a faux fur wristlet and a dapper fedora. The line comes in sizes 12-18 months to 12 years, and 100 per cent of the net sales proceeds will be donated to the non-profit organisation Baby2Baby, which provides necessities for children living in poverty.</p>
      <p>“I have always wished to bring my design and glamour to children’s wear,” said mother-of-two Zoe in a statement. “This collection includes all my favorite design elements with metallics, sparkle and luxurious fabrics that are easily wearable for the most active little ones.”</p>
      <p>Children’s style is something Zoe has invested significant time in recently — earlier this year she teamed up with Pottery Barn Kids and Pottery Barn Teen on a line of interior accessories for kids’ and teens’ bedrooms. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
