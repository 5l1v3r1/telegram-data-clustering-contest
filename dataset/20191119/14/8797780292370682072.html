      <p>To be the best, like no one ever was, you’re going to need to master BREEDING in Pokémon Sword and Shield. Not like those filthy Rule 34 forums would have you believe though, but rather with a more tried and trusted method of filling your Pokedex to the brim with all manner of critters that ordinarily can’t be found outside in the Wild Area.</p>
      <p>To do just that, you’re going to want a Ditto! Essentially a living fleshlight, Ditto happen to have the most malleable DNA around and can breed with just about any Pokémon around and produce an egg that gives you the pocket monster you’ve been after. They can’t breed with Legendary Pokémon though, but for completing your Pokedex? They’re absolutely essential.</p>
      <h3>Where to find Ditto</h3>

      <p>Once you’ve made your way to Route 9, you’ll get a handy upgrade for your bike that allows you to surf over large bodies of water. Head on back to the Wild Area outside of Hammerlocke, and then hang a right until you reach the Lake of Outrage. Once you cross it, the patches of tall grass should have a 10% chance of spawning a Ditto so you’ll need to be patient here until it pops up. To catch it, it’s handy to have a Pokémon that knows False Swipe, which will knock all but a single health point off of Ditto.</p>
      <p>You can grab that TM from the Motostoke Poke Mart. With a Ditto in your possession, the next stop is a Pokémon Nursery. You can find one on Route 5 and another in the Bridge Field Zone of the Wild Area. Head to either one (The Route 5 one is easiest as you can grab a Corviknight taxi there). And there you go! You’ve got a Ditto, you probably want to breed an army of Eevee and there isn’t any limit to how many eggs you can make them spit out. Have fun breeding!</p>
