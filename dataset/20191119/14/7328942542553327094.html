      <p>If you like <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/why-you-should-treat-yourself-to-xbox-game-pass">video games</a>, you definitely know about Half-Life, which is a first-person shooter game. The first-ever Half-Life was released on November 19, 1998. The second game was released on November 16, 2004, and the last game, Half-Life 2: Episode Two was released on October 10, 2007. </p>

      </p>
      <p>And Half-Life fans have been waiting for Half-Life 2: Episode Three or Half-Life 3, but it's been a long time since the last Half-Life game was released.</p>

      <p>On November 18, Valve announced on Twitter their new game, but it doesn't include any <i>3</i> in its name, it's called <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i>. Also, it's a VR (<a href="https://interestingengineering.com/the-history-and-science-of-virtual-reality-headsets">virtual reality</a>) game.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/11/18/valve-just-announced-a-new-half-life-game-but-not-the-one-we-wanted/#60b6caf770d1">This</a> week on Thursday, the game will be introduced to the fans. However, the game has been criticized since it's a VR <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/valves-new-half-life-game-isnt-half-life-3-but-will-be-in-vr/">game</a> and it obviously requires a VR headset, which isn't so cheap for fans all around the world.</p>

      <p>While some other fans are really happy and excited at the moment about the announce of the new Half-Life game, which will be released after 12 years.</p>
