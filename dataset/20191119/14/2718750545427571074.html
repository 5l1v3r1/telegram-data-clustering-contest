      <h1>Who’s the Incredible Woman Who Yells ‘Grow Some Balls!’ at Harold Wilson in <i>The Crown</i>?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:47:45+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:47</time> by <a rel="author">Devon Ivie</a></address>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/the-crown-recap-season-3-episode-3-aberfan.html">Aberfan</a>” is perhaps the most depressing episode of <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/11/the-crown-season-3-cast-actors.html"><i>The Crown</i></a>, given that the narrative focuses on a catastrophic mining disaster in Wales that killed 144 people — 116 of whom were children. (Also, <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/11/the-crown-olivia-colman-perfect-tear.html">the queen can’t cry</a>.) We’d be remiss, though, if we didn’t talk about a magnificently amusing moment between Prime Minister Harold Wilson (Jason Watkins) and a woman who’s near-exclusive purpose is to annoy him or question his authority at any moment of convenience. When he bemoans how Queen Elizabeth (<a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/11/the-crown-olivia-colman-perfect-tear.html">Olivia Colman</a>) won’t visit ground zero of the disaster due to it supposedly not being royal protocol, our mystery gal does <i>not </i>take Wilson’s deference well.</p>
      <p>“You’re pathetic! You disgust me!” she screams. “If you ever want to be a <i>real</i> leader, a <i>real</i> man, a <i>real </i>socialist, you’re going to have to <i>grow some balls!</i>” He … definitely knows she’s right. Look at that face. Cognac, anyone?</p>

      <p>The woman is question is Wilson’s notoriously powerful private secretary, Marcia Falkender, who effectively served as his <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47264536">right-hand woman</a> during his tenure at 10 Downing Street — as well as throughout his 27 years in political office for the Labour party. (Stylized as Marcia Williams in <i>The Crown</i> due to her first marriage, she’s played<i> </i>with great aplomb by English actress Sinead Matthews.) Also referred to as Baroness Falkender, she began working with Wilson when he became a new Parliament member for the now-dissolved Huyton constituency in 1956, and she soon <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/16/lady-falkender-obituary-marcia-williams">grew a reputation</a> for being “imperious, impulsive, and unpredictable,” but “feared” for her power and sharp insight. “Yes, I suppose so,” she explained, in the below 1984 interview, about government ministers being intimidated by her. “But they’d be equally in awe of any man near a prime minister, too. I think this has been overdrawn and exaggerated because I’m a woman. It lent an additional dimension to it, but not a real one, really.”</p>

      <p>“I acted as his ears and eyes. I just went about my business,” she added about her boss. “Only later on, until after I left, did I realize the importance others had attached to my job, which I hadn’t.” In her subsequent post-Wilson years, Falkender enjoyed her status as a peer in the House of Lords and served on an array of film committees, and, in one last screw-you move, <a href="https://www.pressreader.com/uk/scottish-daily-mail/20150418/282140699911783">tried to expense</a> the Lords for £128,000 worth of taxi-ride commutes. She <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/16/lady-falkender-obituary-marcia-williams">died</a> earlier this year at the age of 86, with big proverbial balls.</p>
