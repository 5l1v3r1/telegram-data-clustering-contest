      <p>Banaras Hindu University on Tuesday opened a probe after a photograph of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was found defaced in a classroom of the political science department.</p>
      <p>In the morning, students ran into the photograph, splashed with ink and lying on the ground. Some students started a protest and handed a memorandum to university officials, demanding action against those behind the act of vandalism. There is a “nexus at work,” a student told reporters, drawing a parallel between this incident and the defacement of the statue of Swami Vivekananda at Jawaharlal Nehru University.</p>
      <p>The political science department said it replaced the photograph with a new one.</p>
      <p>Head of the Department Ashok Upadhyay said the incident was a minor one, but “not an ordinary one from the national perspective.” A three-member committee was formed to probe the matter, he said.</p>
