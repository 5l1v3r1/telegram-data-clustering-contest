      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/anthony-joshua/">Anthony Joshua</a> muttered some final words of motivation to himself during his ring-walk to face <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/andy-ruiz-jr/">Andy Ruiz Jr</a> last June.</p>
      <p>Ruiz Jr would inflict a shocking defeat on Joshua at Madison Square Garden, stripping the Brit of his three world titles with a seventh-round knockout.</p>
      <p>The likes of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/18/anthony-joshua-plans-switched-ring-walk-andy-ruiz-jr-rematch-10764453/">Tyson Fury pointed to Joshua’s demeanor during the ring-walk</a> as an indicator the defending champion wasn’t in the right frame of mind.</p>
      <p>With his rematch with Ruiz Jr fast approaching, behind-the-scenes footage has been released of the first fight in New York.</p>

      <p>Cameras are following AJ through MSG as he prepares to enter the arena and he can be heard whispering some final words of encouragement.</p>
      <p>‘Base, head movement and throwing calmly,’ Joshua says to himself around the <b>15:15</b> mark, flanked by security and his promoter Eddie Hearn.</p>

      <p>In the wake of the loss, Joshua admitted he was not as ‘switched on’ as he should have been when he made his ring-walk.</p>
      <p>‘I need to start taking this approach to my fights where I’m a bit more lively,’ he said on Eddie Hearn’s BBC podcast.</p>
      <p>‘I know I’m capable of it,’ he added. ‘There is too much at stake.</p>

      <p>‘If I go in there where I’m switched on, a time like the Ruiz fight where I am so relaxed, that might be the difference.’</p>
      <p>Joshua targets revenge over Ruiz Jr on 7 December after branding the Mexican’s win over him the result of a ‘lucky punch sent by the gods.’</p>
      <p>Ruiz Jr will again be the underdog for the fight as he defends the WBO, WBA (Super) and IBF titles against Joshua in Saudi Arabia.</p>
