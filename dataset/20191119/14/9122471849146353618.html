      <h1>Redskins Lineman Addresses The Viral Dwayne Haskins Video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:10:28+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>A Washington Redskins offensive lineman believes the viral video of quarterback Dwayne Haskins talking to his teammates on the sideline has been “misunderstood.”</p>
      <p>Video surfaced Sunday night of Haskins attempting to lead his Redskins’ offensive linemen on the bench. Haskins can be heard saying “what do I have to do to help you? What do I have to do?”</p>
      <p>The Redskins were in the middle of a 34-17 loss to the Jets and it didn’t look like any of Washington’s linemen were interested in what Haskins was saying.</p>
      <p>Washington lineman Morgan Moses addressed the video on Monday.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t him coming to us saying, ‘Hey you guys need to block better,’ ” <a href="https://www-washingtonpost-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/18/morgan-moses-says-video-dwayne-haskins-pleading-with-linemen-has-been-misunderstood/?outputType=amp&amp;usqp=mq331AQCKAE%3D&amp;amp_js_v=0.1#ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2F2019%2F11%2F18%2Fmorgan-moses-says-video-dwayne-haskins-pleading-with-linemen-has-been-misunderstood%2F">Moses said</a>. “It was him trying to figure out, he knows we’re a veteran group and we’ve seen a lot of things. The things that he can’t see, maybe we can see. I explained to him, like: ‘Hey, bro, we’re in a five-man protection and they’re bringing seven. There’s nothing that we can do.’ We blocked the five, [but] there’s another two that’s free wherever they’re coming from. With that understanding, we have to have something in place to handle that.”</p>

      <p>Moses appeared to be the lone Redskins lineman who responded to Haskins in the video.</p>
      <p>Washington interim head coach Bill Callahan also addressed the video.</p>
      <p>“There’s so many things that go into that, a sideline conversation or dialogue,” Callahan said. “The main focus of that is protection-oriented and what he can do with protections and how he can help the line and what he can do better. I think that was the gist of the conversation. I make no more, no less of that. It happens all the time.”</p>
      <p>The Redskins fell to 1-9 on the season with Sunday’s loss. Haskins threw for 214 yards, two touchdowns and one interception in the loss.</p>
