      <p>JERUSALEM:Â Israel's air defences intercepted four rockets fired from neighbouring Syria on Tuesday (Nov 19), the army said, prompting reported retaliatory missile strikes against the source of the fire.</p>
      <p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the rockets were fired from positions around the capital held by groups loyal to the Damascus government.</p>

      <p>It did not elaborate on which group had launched the rockets or whether there had been any casualties in the retaliatory strikes.</p>
      <p>The flareup comes after a major escalation in and around Gaza last week following Israel's targeted killing of a commander of Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad, which is allied with Damascus.</p>
      <p>The killing was accompanied by a second strike, unconfirmed by Israel, on an Islamic Jihad leader in Damascus that killed his son and another person.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate rocket fire from Syria following that strike.</p>
      <p>"Four launches were identified from Syria towards Israeli territory which were intercepted by the Israeli air defence systems," the Israeli military said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"No hits on Israeli communities were identified."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, blasts were heard close to the airport in the Syrian capital Damascus, the state SANA news agency reported.</p>
      <p>It gave no further details but the Observatory reported "missile fire by Israeli aircraft on positions south and southwest of Damascus".</p>
      <p>Syrian air defences opened fire in response, the Britain-based war monitor said.</p>
      <p>"The Israeli bombardment targeted positions held by pro-regime groups who launched the missiles against Israel," Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP.</p>
      <p>Israel has carried out frequent air and missile strikes against targets inside Syria since the country descended into civil war in 2011.</p>
      <p>Most have been against what Israel said were Iranian targets or positions of Iran's Lebanese ally, Shiite militant group Hezbollah.</p>
      <p>Both are sworn enemies of Israel and both have backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces with advisers or fighters.</p>
      <p>Israel has also carried out some strikes targeting Palestinian rejectionist factions based in Damascus, like last week's strike that Islamic Jihad said targeted one of its leaders.</p>
      <p>Islamic Jihad joined other militant groups in agreeing a fragile new UN- and Egyptian-brokered truce around Gaza after last week's two-day flareup.</p>
      <p>It came after senior Islamic Jihad leader Baha Abu Al-Ata, whom Israel blamed for recent rocket fire into its territory, was killed in a strike on his home in Gaza City.</p>
      <p>In response Islamic Jihad, which is allied with Gaza's rulers Hamas, fired around 450 rockets towards Israel, which struck back with more air strikes.</p>
      <p>The flareup saw 34 Palestinians and no Israelis killed.</p>
      <p>A ceasefire between Israel and militant groups including Islamic Jihad was agreed after 50 hours of clashes, but the deal remains precarious.</p>
