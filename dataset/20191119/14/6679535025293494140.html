      <p>The Imphal West district police arrested Yumnamcha Dilipkumar, convener of the Manipur People Against Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (MANPAC), here on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The MANPAC, a collective of civil society organisations, has called an 18-hour strike in Manipur since midnight Monday. As MANPAC leader, he has been spearheading protests against the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, in Manipur after its passage. It is also among the organisations spearheading campaign against the Naga agreement.</p>
      <p>The arrest came after Chief Minister N. Biren appealed to civil society organisations to hold talks with him. His earlier appeal for talks did not evoke any response from the organisations, which insisted on a special session of the Assembly to discuss the Naga agreement.</p>
