      <p>Sabarimala witnessed heavy rain on Tuesday posing much difficulty to pilgrims in undertaking the trek through the steep Neelimala path.</p>
      <p>However, a large number of Ayyappa devotees, most of them from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, trekked the hills braving the heavy downpour.</p>
      <p>The police personnel deployed on the holy 18 steps (Pathinettampady) extended a helping hand to the pilgrims climbing the steep steps leading to the temple.</p>
      <h3>LMVs permitted</h3>
      <p>Special Commissioner appointed by the Kerala High Court M. Manoj said the court has permitted chauffeur-driven light motor vehicles (LMV) to take the pilgrims to Pampa and return to Nilackal after dropping the passengers at Pampa.</p>
      <p>The court order came as a relief to scores of pilgrims who were forced to terminate their journey at the Nilackal base camp and proceed to Pampa only in KSRTC chain services.</p>
      <p>The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) has made arrangements to provide sufficient number of pilgrim shelters to accommodate 17,000 people at the Sannidhanam, according to devaswom executive officer Rajendra Prasad.</p>
      <p>The board has opened 40 counters for supplying medicated drinking water at the Sannidhanam, besides the drinking water kiosks.</p>
      <p>The TDB works department has provided storage tanks having a total capacity of 2.65 crore litres at the Sannidhanam.</p>
      <p>Chief engineer G. Krishnakumar told <i>The Hindu</i> that the department had provided 998 toilets, including 500 container toilets, at the Sannidhanam.</p>
      <p>Mr. Krishnakumar said the sewage treatment plant with a capacity to treat five million litres of sewage a day at the Sannidhanam was fully operational. This was besides three incinerators for solid waste disposal.</p>
      <p>He said the board had provided 970 toilets at the Nilackal base camp and 130 drinking water kiosks.</p>
      <p>The Nilackal base camp has also got facility to accommodate 9,000 pilgrims at its shelters, besides parking facility for 9,000 vehicles in 16 parking lots.</p>
