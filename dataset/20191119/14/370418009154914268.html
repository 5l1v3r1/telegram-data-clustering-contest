      <p>Last year’s first-ever <a href="https://epicenterfestival.com/">Epicenter</a> fest in Rockingham, North Carolina, brought together a pretty stacked list of artists, including Tool, Foo Fighters, Bring Me The Horizon, Judas Priest, and plenty more. Now, the festival has announced its 2020 line-up, to perform the first weekend of May at the Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, NC — and man, they might have outdone themselves this second time around.</p>
      <p>As per their announcement earlier this year, we already knew that <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/metallica/">Metallica</a> would <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/metallica-announce-two-headlining-sets-at-every-danny-wimmer-festival-of-2020/">headline two different nights at the fest, as they’re doing at every Danny Wimmer Presents festival of 2020</a>. And as Wimmer himself puts it, “Metallica<b> </b>isn’t just another headliner. When Metallica takes the stage, it’s an event. It’s an experience. That’s the same standard we’ve set for every DWP<b> </b>festival — from the first band to the last band, and everything that happens in between.”</p>
      <p>However, while the Four Horsemen will close out both Friday and Sunday night, this year’s Saturday night will be headlined by <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/disturbed/">Disturbed</a>. Of course, it’s not as though the openers — including <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/deftones/">Deftones</a>, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/lynyrd-skynyrd/">Lynyrd Skynyrd</a>, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/godsmack/">Godsmack</a>, and <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/papa-roach/">Papa Roach</a> — are any less impressive. And all of this doesn’t even take into account all the food and vendors that’ll be present at the fest.</p>
