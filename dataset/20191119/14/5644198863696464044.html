      <p>JERUSALEM: Israel's anti-missile defence system intercepted four rockets fired from neighbouring Syria on Tuesday (Nov 19), the army said.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, blasts were heard close to Damascus airport in the Syrian capital, the official SANA news agency reported on Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>Around 450 rockets were fired into Israel last week from the Gaza Strip in the aftermath of a military operation against an Islamic Jihad commander, according to the Israeli army, but no rockets were reported to have been fired from Syria.</p>
      <p>Baha Abu Al-Ata, who Israel blamed for recent rocket fire into its territory, was killed in a strike on his home in Gaza City.</p>
      <p>A ceasefire between Israel and the Islamic Jihad was agreed after 50 hours of clashes, but the deal remains precarious.</p>
      <p>On the same day as strikes killed Ata, Syrian state media reported that an Israeli strike hit the home of another Islamic Jihad militant, killing his son and another person.</p>
      <p>Islamic Jihad accused Israel of being behind the strike in Damascus. The Israeli army refused to comment.</p>
