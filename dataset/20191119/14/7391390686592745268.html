      <p>Covering health at Bustle, I read a new story almost daily about how Americans are more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/americans-stressful.html">stressed out</a> than ever before, more<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/youre-not-getting-enough-sleep-and-its-killing-you/"> sleep-deprived</a> than ever before, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/29/share-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-record-high/">having less sex</a> than ever before, or a combination of all three. It's no secret that people everywhere need a whopping dose of self-care, that elusive exercise that few of us seem to know how to really do. And while many self-care practices don't require you to buy something for them to work (see: showering, getting enough sleep), sometimes the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/most-wanted-holiday-2018-healthand-wellness">best wellness gifts</a> really can help you destress, or sleep better, or have more sex.</p>
      <p>The gifts I've picked for this list aren't meant to replace those classics of self-care — the exercising, the meditating, the showering — that you can do for free. Instead, they aim to make these processes easier, more intentional, more luxurious — turning them into things you actually make time for in your day. Rather than forgetting to schedule that acupuncture appointment, you can lie on an acupressure mat while you watch your nightly <i>Friends </i>episode (or four). Instead of getting tangled in your headphones, you can turn on a pillow that broadcasts white noise directly into your ears. And during a time of year when there's enormous pressure from all sides, self-care really is the gift that keeps on giving. Keep reading for my top picks.</p>
