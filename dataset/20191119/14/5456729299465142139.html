      <h1>Senate reintroduces whistleblower and witness protection bill</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:26:49+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/364096-senate-reintroduces-whistleblower-and-witness-protection-bill.html" target="_blank">QueenEsther Iroanusi</a></address>
      <p>The Senate has reintroduced the Whistleblower and Witness Protection Bill.</p>
      <p>The bill which seeks to protect whistleblowers and witnesses was one of the 11 bills read for the first time during plenary on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The ‘Whistleblower and Witness Protection Bill, 2019’ is sponsored by Benjamin Uwajumogu (Imo North).</p>
      <p>The eighth Senate had passed a similar bill in 2017. The bill made provision for financial rewards to encourage citizens who expose corruption.</p>
      <p>It also sought to protect whistleblowers against victimisation and loss of jobs. The person who makes a disclosure shall not be subject to victimisation by his or her employer or by fellow employees.</p>
      <p>The bill sought to encourage and facilitate disclosures of improper conduct by public officers and public bodies and those who make such disclosures are protected under the law.</p>
      <p>“Clause 34 deals with the establishment of disclosure. What is given to a whistleblower is stipulated. What is proposed is in line with the government. Clause 45 deals with penalty. Provides stringent punishment of less than five years or a fine of N10 million,” David Umaru, then chairman of senate judiciary committee, had said before it was passed for third reading at the time.</p>
      <p>“The bill seeks adequate protection of whistleblowers from reprisals, victimisation, job losses and humiliation which are some of the consequences of whistleblowing.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the witness protection bill also passed by the 8th Senate sought to create and operate a programme that protects witnesses who provide vital information, evidence or render assistance to law enforcement agencies in certain investigations, enquiries or prosecutions.</p>
      <p>The lawmakers are expected to debate the details of the bill on another legislative day.</p>
