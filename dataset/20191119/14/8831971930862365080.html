      <h1>WATCH: Cardi B Drops New Freestyle on Instagram</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:58:21+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://collegecandy.com/author/jnsanchez/" target="_blank">Josh Sanchez</a></address>
      <p>Cardi B is back with some new music. The Bronx rapper has fans anxiously awaiting her sophomore album, but for now, they will have to settle for a new freestyle that she decided to drop recently on Instagram. The freestyle was to the beat of Cam’ron’s “357.”</p>
      <p>During the freestyle, Cardi referenced her recent role in the Jennifer Lopez film <i>Hustler</i>.</p>
      <p>Over the beat, Cardi raps: “I be in the mansion, you be in my mentions / I came right out the trenches to the top of the charts / Lost friends on the way / This sh*t is breaking my heart / About 30 seconds in I’m like where do I start / I don’t act, I’m a hustler just playing my part.”</p>
      <p>She finishes off the freestyle with the line “a little something until I finish the album,” before dropping the emphatic Bronx greeting of “SUCK MY D*CK!”</p>
      <p>You can check out the freestyle below.</p>

      <p>While there are still very few details about her sophomore project, the rapper previously said that she may roll with the name<i> Tiger Woods</i> for the album.</p>
      <p>“Because, remember when everybody was talking (expletive) on Tiger Woods, like ‘Oh blah blah, blah blah this, blah blah that,’” she said during a past Instagram Live session, “and then he (expletive) came and won that green jacket? That’s what I’m going to name my album.”</p>
      <p>For now, we will just have to wait and see what the project will include.</p>
