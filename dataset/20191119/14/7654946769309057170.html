      <h1>Kanye West, Dr. Dre announce ‘Jesus Is King Part II’ album</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:01:22+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:01</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Frishberg</a></address>
      <p>“Jesus” is being resurrected — just three weeks after its first incarnation.</p>
      <p>Kanye West, 42, and legendary producer Dr. Dre, 54, took to Twitter Monday to post nearly identical messages announcing a second installment of West’s “Jesus Is King” album. The first installment of the long-delayed gospel album dropped in late October to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/25/kanyes-jesus-is-king-is-a-better-gospel-album-than-expected/">mixed reviews</a>.</p>
      <p>“Ye and Dre Jesus is King Part II coming soon,” both posted alongside a photo of the two of them in a studio. West’s <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1196524372044861440">post</a> has so far racked up over 291,000 likes, while <a href="https://twitter.com/drdre/status/1196526595864875008">Dre’s</a> has gotten 44,000.</p>
      <p>The pair have not previously collaborated, although Yeezus has long been a fan of the six-time Grammy Award-winning “Nuthin’ but a ‘G’ Thang” rap icon.</p>
      <p>“He’s the definition of a true talent,” West once <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446/dr-dre-6-88124/">wrote in a Rolling Stone essay</a>.</p>
      <p>The early announcement from the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/24/kanye-west-has-exhausted-fans-patience-ahead-of-jesus-is-king/">procrastinating superstar</a> comes on the heels of West’s news of his <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/kanye-announces-nebuchadnezzar-an-opera-on-the-biblical-king/">first-ever opera</a>, named for the longest-reigning monarch of Babylon, and him telling celebrity pastor <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/17/kanye-west-talks-about-serving-god-during-visit-with-joel-osteen/?_ga=2.10173170.619155908.1574080720-1455599946.1573822319">Joel Osteen</a> that he no longer cares for fame and money but is “in service to God.”</p>
