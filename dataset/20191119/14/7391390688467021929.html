      <p>It's all well and good to "eat, drink, and be merry" during the holidays, but there are so many ways for you to do so that it can feel borderline impossible to know where to begin. That's where these <a href="https://www.bustle.com/most-wanted-holiday-2018-food-drink">food and drink gift ideas</a> come in — to hopefully help you untangle all of those visions of sugar plums dancing in your head. I rounded up the year's best in all things eating, drinking, and cooking so you can spend less time searching and more time on that second (OK, fourth) helping of pecan pie.</p>
      <p>All of the products featured on this list made their debuts in 2019, which make them ideal gifts for the foodie who already has it all. Whether you're looking to make food, eat food, or just find a creative way to announce to the world that you are, in fact, here for the food, there's something here that will strike a chord in your hungry heart. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if a few of these slipped into your cart twice while you're shopping for others — because you <i>definitely </i>deserve a treat for yourself too, right?</p>
      <p>Here are the best food and drink recommendations for everyone on your list.</p>
