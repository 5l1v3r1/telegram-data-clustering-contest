      <p>Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL), a subsidiary of ONGC Limited, has begun producing ultra low sulphur diesel and petrol.</p>
      <p>Considering the recent lower domestic demand for diesel, the company has loaded the first export shipment of ultra low sulphur grade diesel at a premium.</p>
      <p>The company is putting all-out efforts to maximise domestic movement, including the coastal movement. Going forward, it is envisaged that the domestic demand of diesel will recover eventually leading to reduced exports, it said in a release on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The domestic public sector oil marketing companies have planned to lift the BS VI grade diesel in the coastal belt as well as through the Mangaluru-Bengaluru pipeline from December 2019 onwards with a view to flush the system with ultra pure products before finally commencing retail sales to customers ahead of April 1, 2020 deadline, it said.</p>
      <p>There have been reports in some sections of media that MRPL is planning to invest for capacity expansion. In this regard, the company would like to clarify that it has initiated some of the long-term activities necessary for the expansion plans.</p>
      <p>These include acquisition of land through the KIADB which is under way, carrying out initial configuration and preparation of a preliminary feasibility study and further application to the government for environment clearance.</p>
      <p>The project is under detailed techno-economic feasibility and subject to necessary statutory, regulatory and investment approvals, the release said.</p>
