      <h1>Arsenal youth coach tells Raul Sanllehi how club can save millions in the transfer market</h1>
      <h2>Marcel Lucassen has told the Arsenal board how they can save millions in the transfer market</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Challies</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal's head of development Marcel Lucassen has told the club how they and save millions in the transfer market by keeping faith in the young players in the squad.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/">Gunners</a> have benefited from the rises of Joe Willock, Reiss Nelson and Bukayo Saka over the course of the past 18 months, with Unai Emery utilising a number of young talents.</p>
      <p>While Arsenal have not been afraid to splash the cash, as shown by their club-record capture of Nicolas Pepe in the summer, they certainly do not have the same financial pull as the likes of Manchester City.</p>
      <p>As such, a rebuilding phase at the Emirates Stadium could prove to be extremely expensive but Lucassen has explained how the young players coming through can assist.</p>
      <p>“Why are clubs on a world class level only for a period? Because there will be a rebuilding phase after time, new players from other clubs come in and these players need time to settle in," he told <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/arsenals-lucassen-many-coaches-havent-got-a-clue-and-try-to-mask-that-with-words/view/news/348812">TransferMarkt</a>.</p>
      <p>"If I take youth players instead of expensive new signings, they maybe make one or two mistakes more, but they have the advantage of non-verbal communication.</p>
      <p>"Because they played together in the youth setup for years, they know how the other works and especially about the patters of movements. In the end the rebuilding phase is significantly shorter.”</p>

      <p>Another factor that Lucassen believes must be considered is how the players react on the field, as he explained how they coach each other when on the field.</p>
      <p>“From the moment on, when the referee blows the starting whistle, football is a pure player sport.</p>
      <p>"Because of the crowd, no player understands what the coach shouts in from the outside.</p>
      <p>"In training, I have the possibility to interrupt situations and to explain.</p>
      <p>"An outstanding coach manages that players coach each other during games.”</p>
