      <p>VANCOUVER - Firefighters had to work quickly to rescue six residents of a burning apartment building in south Vancouver.</p>
      <p>The blaze broke out early Tuesday in an three storey, 24-unit wood-frame building in the city's Marpole neighbourhood, trapping four people on balconies.</p>
      <p>Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services Asst. Chief Dave Boone says those residents were rescued by ladder, but crews also had to enter the building to find two others who had become disoriented in the heavy smoke.</p>
      <p>One of the two was unconscious but Boone says both were safely removed from the building and taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>He says he's been told the unconscious resident has revived and both patients are considered stable.</p>
      <p>The fire had been doused within about two hours but a cause remains under investigation. (Global, News1130)</p>
