      <p>DeHaven opened up to VladTV about facing life in his federal case and deciding to take it to trial after seeing the discovery papers and realizing they didn't have anything on him. He explained that he was previously convicted of several minor drug charges and he left the game three years prior to his indictment, which DeHaven said ended up saving him. DeHaven also spoke about Jay-Z's associate Emory Jones being indicted in the same case and learning that the feds had wiretapped Jones' phone. To hear more, hit the above clip.</p>
