      <h2>Cisco's revenue guidance caused CSCO stock price to drop</h2>

      <p><b>Cisco</b> <b>Systems</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/csco-stock-quote/"><b><u>CSCO</u></b></a>) stock is down 7% since it <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/951347115/files/doc_financials/2020/q1/Q1-FY20-Press-Release-(2).pdf">reported its fiscal first-quarter earnings</a> on Nov. 13. The drop provides a good buying opportunity for astute value investors.</p>

      <p>Cisco reported great Q1 revenue and earnings . But the company said it expects its Q2 revenue to drop 3% to 5% year-over-year.</p>
      <p>Cisco provided Q2 earnings per share guidance  of 75 cents to 77 cents, down from 84 cents in Q1.</p>
      <p>Cisco Systems stock reacted badly to those forecasts, despite its good Q1 results. This drop, however, provides a good buying opportunity for value investors.</p>
      <h3>The Weakness of Cisco Systems Stock Has Created a Buying Opportunity</h3>
      <p>As of yesterday’s close, Cisco stock trades for just 13.3 times its expected earnings. In addition, the company is generating positive  free cash flow. CSCO produces about $10 billion of free cash flow annually. Since the market cap of CSCO stock is $191 billion, its FCF yield is an attractive 5.2%.</p>
      <p>Cisco’s dividend will likely not be cut, since its free cash flow is positive. Cisco stock has a very attractive dividend yield of 3.10%.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Cisco is still buying back CSCO stock, although at a slower rate than before. In Q1, it spent $800 million on buying back Cisco stock.</p>
      <p>Another attractive development is that Cisco paid down its debt by $6 billion in fiscal Q1, reducing its debt outstanding by 25% to $18.5 billion. That will help boost CSCO</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>

      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>stock price, since it will raise the company’s pre-tax earnings by almost 5%.</p>
      <h3>The Gamesmanship of Guidance</h3>
      <p>It’s not like Cisco Systems hasn’t provided conservative guidance before. It said it expected its revenue to decline this quarter due to  weaker macroeconomic trends.</p>
      <p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4306865-cisco-revenue-problem">One Seeking Alpha author  noted</a> that Cisco has forecast revenue declines in the past, only to exceed expectations when its results came out. Bringing down expectations so as to later beat them is a way to prevent CSCO stock price from completely collapsing when the company’s results come in below expectations.</p>
      <h3>Cisco Stock Should Still Do Quite Well Over the Next Year</h3>
      <p>Analysts, on average, are projecting revenue of $51 billion for the year ending July 2020, and $52.5 billion by July 2021. That puts Cisco Systems stock at an enterprise value-to-revenue ratio of just 3.55 times ($181.6 billion divided by 51 billion). That is very inexpensive for a technology stock.</p>
      <p>For example, <b>Citrix Systems</b> (NASDAQ:<b><u><a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/ctxs-stock-quote/"><b><u>CTXS</u></b></a></u></b>) stock trades at an EV-revenue ratio of five. Another competitor, <b>Motorola Solutions</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/msi-stock-quote/"><b><u>MSI</u></b></a>) trades at an EV-revenue ratio of 4.25. So Cisco Systems stock is quite cheap.</p>
      <h3>What Should Investors Do?</h3>
      <p>It’s not uncommon for a stock that disappoints investors, as Cisco recently has, to tread water for a while. I would expect that investors will have some good opportunities to buy Cisco stock at attractive  prices over the next quarter or two.</p>
      <p>Cisco  stock has a high 3.1% dividend yield and it its share buybacks continue at this pace ($800 million per quarter), its buyback yield will be 1.7% ($3.2 billion divided by $190 billion). So its total yield will be 4.8% (the 3.1% dividend yield plus the 1.7% buyback yield). That is an attractive return on capital for investors.</p>
