      <p>Interested to know how yesterday’s antique World War II bomb was detonated with little damage? The Singapore army gave an inside look into its operation, which involved setting up a trench and dozens of sandbags. </p>
      <p>See the bomb squad at work in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oursingaporearmy/videos/491923584755860/">40-second clip</a> — with epic soundtrack to boot — from start to explosive finale in detonating a bomb that had sat unexploded for about eight decades until it was found during excavation work at the site of an upcoming condominium building.</p>
      <p>The bomb was successfully disposed of at about 4:35 pm, police had said in an update. </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>“Involving around 40 SAF personnel, the disposal was done in a controlled manner to mitigate any potential effects of the blast and disruption to the surroundings,” the video’s caption read.</p>
      <p>Nearby condominium residents and guests at the Grand Copthorne Hotel had to be evacuated for the operation. Some witness reports said the ground could be <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/residents-vacate-homes-roads-closed-during-wwii-bomb-disposal-near-singapore-river-on">felt shaking</a>, and photos showed smoke rising from the scene.</p>
      <p>Disposing of the bomb involved “digging a containment trench” and setting up an “overhead cover with compacted sandbags stacked together” to contain the blast, the post said. </p>
      <p>The squad also broke the bomb’s casing open “to burn the main explosives within.”</p>
      <p>The clip, posted online by the army late last night, ends with a really quick explosion.</p>

      <p>Many praised the army for their getting rid of the bomb safely, while others thought the operation seemed “anti-climactic” for all the hype that it had garnered online. </p>
      <p>“The complete anti-climax ending showed that the soldiers did a great job … If the 50kg bomb had a mind of its own it would have felt so insulted to go out in such a small blast,” one said in the comments.</p>
      <p>Others made light of the fact the ordnance was found under former nightclub Zouk that many attended in its 30 years.</p>
      <p>“Huh 50kg?!?! Sure or not? More like 5kg; Or maybe just maybe it was my old lighter I left at zouk while I was clubbing those days. Jokes aside still a job well done,” wrote a Manuel John. </p>
      <p>And the overly dramatic score earned a few rotten tomatoes from the army of armchair critics out there.</p>
      <p>“The soundtrack louder than the explosion,” one wrote.</p>
