      <p>In conjunction with the release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Rise_of_Skywalker">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</a> next month, Samsung has released a special edition Kylo Ren-themed <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/samsung-galaxy-note-10/">Galaxy Note 10+</a>. The flagship device is bundled in a special box that comes with an additional case, badges and accessories.</p>

      <p>The Galaxy Note 10+ device comes in black with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Order_(Star_Wars)">First Order</a> and Star Wars logo printed on the rear panel. There’s even a red S Pen which mimics Kylo Ren’s light sabre but don’t expect it to light up during intensive note-taking action. The frame around the camera bump as well as the side buttons are also in red.</p>
      <p>The special edition box also contains a pair of Galaxy Buds that has a matching red and black colour scheme. To complete the experience, you also get pre-installed Star Wars themed-content such as wallpapers, shutdown animations, icons and sound packs.</p>

      <p>In terms of availability, the Galaxy Note 10+ Star Wars special edition will be offered in selected markets beginning December 2019. In the US, it is going for USD 1,299 (about RM5,404) and it will be on sale starting 13 December on Amazon, selected Best Buy outlets, Microsoft Stores, Samsung.com and Samsung Experience stores.</p>
      <p>Spec-wise, we think this Galaxy Note 10+ should be equipped with 512GB of storage and the rest of the hardware should be the same as the standard Note 10+. Upfront, it comes with a 6.8″ Quad HD+ Dynamic AMOLED display and comes with a quad-camera setup for the rear. Unfortunately, we still don’t know if it will be coming to Malaysia but you could probably get one from a grey importer. Are you interested in this Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ Star Wars Edition?
