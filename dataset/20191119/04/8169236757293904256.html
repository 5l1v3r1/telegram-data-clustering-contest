      <h1>Manchester United eyeing £25.6m Ligue 1 starlet as Paul Pogba replacement</h1>

        <b>Manchester United are reportedly interested in signing Rennes teenager Eduardo Camavinga as a long-term replacement for Camavinga.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite being only 17, the midfielder has become a regular for the Ligue 1 side this season, making 16 appearances across all competitions. So far, Camavinga has provided an assist against PSG.</p>

      </p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10362873/man-utd-line-up-26m-transfer-bid-for-french-wonderkid-camavinga-as-pogba-heads-for-real-madrid-in-swap-deal-with-bale/">Sun</a>, Manchester United are interested in signing the teenager who has a buyout clause of £25.6 million on his current contract with Rennes which runs out in 2022. This report also suggests that the Red Devils consider him as a long-term replacement for Pogba who could join Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10361226/man-utd-gareth-bale-transfer-paul-pogba-real-madrid/">Sun</a> stated a few days back that the French international could be on his way to the Bernabeu in a deal that could see Gareth Bale join Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Camavinga has been quite impressive for Rennes so far and he could attract attention from Europe’s top clubs. He could be a fine addition to Manchester United’s squad but as far as replacing Pogba is concerned, the Red Devils should sign a more experienced player as it will be very hard for a teenager from Ligue 1 to have a massive impact on the Premier League.</p>
