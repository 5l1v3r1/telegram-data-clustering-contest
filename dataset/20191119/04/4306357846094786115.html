      <h3>Manchester United and Arsenal are both keeping tabs on 17-year-old Hartlepool goalkeeper Brad Young, according to reports in the British media.</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10364285/man-utd-arsenal-hartlepool-brad-young/">Sun</a> is reporting that both of the Premier League clubs are keeping a close eye on the teenager as they consider making a move to sign him.</p>
      <p>The same story says that the Gunners and the Red Devils have been “alerted” to the teenager’s talent after he received an England youth call-up.</p>
      <p>The article states that Young only turned professional this summer and that Hartlepool are likely to want a “decent” fee if he were to move up the ladder quickly.</p>
      <p>Both Arsenal and Manchester United are likely to be linked with a number of new players in the coming weeks and months in the lead-up to the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The Gunners currently find themselves in sixth place in the Premier League table, with Manchester United a position further back in seventh.</p>
      <p>Both clubs will have to step up their Premier League form in the coming weeks as they look to try and force their way back into contention for a top-four finish this season.</p>
      <p>Arsenal finished fifth in the table, while Manchester United ended up in sixth place in the Premier League table last term.</p>
