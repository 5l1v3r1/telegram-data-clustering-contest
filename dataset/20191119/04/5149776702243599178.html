      <h1>Nottingham Forest warned to cash in on player but hold nerve over new deal for manager</h1>
      <h2>Nottingham Forest return to action after the last international break of the year with games at Bristol City and QPR</h2>

      <h3>DEMANDING MORE</h3>
      <p>Sabri Lamouchi has demanded his Nottingham Forest players return from the latest international break in better shape than the previous one.</p>
      <p>Forest went on a 10-game unbeaten run prior to October’s pause for internationals, form which also saw the Frenchman become the first City Ground chief to collect a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/sabri-lamouchi-nottingham-forest-manager-3415507">Manager of the Month award</a> since Billy Davies in 2013.</p>

      <h3>HOLD YOUR NERVE</h3>
      <p>Talk of new contracts at Nottingham <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> should be put on hold for the time being.</p>
      <p>At least until the end of January at the earliest, in my opinion, once the transfer window is done and dusted.</p>
      <p>Sabri Lamouchi’s deal has been discussed in recent weeks, given the impressive way in which he’s adapted to life in English Football and at the City Ground, which is understandable.</p>

      <h3>CASHING IN?</h3>
      <p>It didn’t come as a huge surprise to see <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/matty-cash">Matty Cash</a> linked with a move away from Nottingham Forest when the transfer window opens in the New Year</p>
      <p>In all honesty, seeing your players linked with other clubs can be seen as a good thing because generally, it means they’re playing well and so is the team.</p>

      <h3>BIG DIFFERENCE</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> were offering John McGinn "four or five times his money" when they tried to sign him from Hibs, according to the Scottish Premiership club.</p>
      <p>The Scotland international is now playing in the Premier League for Aston Villa, following a move to Villa Park in August 2018.</p>
      <p>And his impressive performances in the top flight has led to him being linked with Manchester United.</p>

      <h3>NEVER NEVER</h3>
      <p>Neil Harris admits his decision to join <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> in 2004 was a mistake.</p>
      <p>Harris, who has just been appointed as the successor to Neil Warnock at Cardiff City, moved to Forest after cutting short a loan spell with the Bluebirds.</p>
