      <h3>Real Madrid’s most important target for 2020 could end up influencing Neymar’s likely move back to Barcelona from Paris Saint-Germain.</h3>
      <p>Paris Saint-Germain boast two extremely powerful names in world football- Kylian Mbappe and Neymar. The Ligue 1 giants have two of the most marketable players and lucrative players from the industry while from the perspective of the roster as well, the duo is absolutely incredible and helpful to PSG’s ambition of finally winning the Champions League. But, Barcelona and Real Madrid have an eagle’s eye on the duo.</p>
      <p>Barcelona have failed in replacing Neymar after seeing investments on Ousmane Dembele and Philippe Coutinho fall flat. The Blaugrana are now looking to get back their former asset but Paris Saint-Germain are playing hardball and refusing to let go of the Brazil international for anything less than a whopping sum of 200 million euros.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid on the other hand have lacked a lethal and consistent goal scorer since Cristiano Ronaldo’s departure to Juventus last summer. The Whites are looking to replace their all-time top goal scorer by signing France international Kylian Mbappe from the Parisians and are willing to pay as high as 300 million euros for his services, and are tipped to land the youngster next summer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/why-kylian-mbappe-could-push-neymar-to-barcelona-7740192"><b>Sport English</b></a> has claimed that Paris Saint-Germain are keen on keeping both the players, but due to FIFA and UEFA imposing Financial Fair Play Restrictions, it is necessary that one of Mbappe or Neymar leaves to avoid any kind of complications, and that’s where the Real Madrid target could end up benefitting the Blaugrana.</p>
      <p>From a marketing view, Neymar is the obvious choice for Paris Saint-Germain to have on their books, but the former Santos winger himself is not happy at the Parc des Princes and wants a return to the Camp Nou. As a matter of fact, Neymar is willing to pay from his own pocket as well so as to force a move to his ex-employer. Hence, PSG are left with very few options on their hands over the Neymar situation.</p>
      <p>In addition to that, Kylian Mbappe is going to be offered 30 million euros of annual wages and if he does agree to the deal, then obviously Neymar would ask for a raise from what he is earning and that is unaffordable for the Ligue 1 champions. Thus, they may hold onto Mbappe for sporting and marketing reasons in mind and let go of Neymar.</p>
      <p>Do you think both, Kylian Mbappe and Neymar, would be leaving Paris Saint-Germain next year?</p>
