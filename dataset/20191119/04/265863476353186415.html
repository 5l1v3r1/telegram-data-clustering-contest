      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:30:16+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Ricki Mathers</a></address>
      <p>Tamar Braxton speaks her mind at all times which has landed her in hot water again and again. The singer just apologized for the second time for some controversial comments that she made.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post that she made clear wasn’t referencing her current boyfriend David Adefeso, Tamar stated that if a man doesn’t want to sleep with his female significant other for multiple days it’s because he is gay.</p>
      <p>‘The truth is ladies that these dudes out here really do be gay!! It ain’t enough money, beauty, hair, babies in the world to keep them!! They want D—!! Periodt!! It’s nothing wrong with you, but they will find EVERY reason in the world to make u not good enough!! If he lays with you for 3,4, 10 days and he don’t touch u, it’s NOT YOU!! HE WANT A MAN!! and that’s on my momma.’</p>

      <p>Almost immediately, she came under fire by the LGBT community who pointed out why her statements were so problematic. Some even insinuated that she must be speaking from her relationship issues with her wall street boyfriend.</p>
      <p>After her name started trending for all the wrong reasons, Tamar apologized and then stated that she has been a supporter of the LGBT community since she was in the fourth grade but will continue to speak her truth.</p>
      <p>This wasn’t good enough for some who pointed out that even her apology was problematic.</p>
      <p>While chatting with fans on Twitter, Tamar retweeted and responded to a fan that wrote: ‘Maybe it’s not what you wrote but how you wrote it , I think now a days everyone takes things to heart so quick and don’t have a clue who your talking about , everyone assumes about everything.’</p>
      <p>The singer added: ‘I agree.saying the”all”word wasn’t right because I don’t believe that. It was irresponsible and insensitive &amp; again,4 all those who were offended, Am truly sorry. I meant no harm.I love&amp;stand with the #lgbt community now &amp; forever. I will be careful of my words. But my (heart) is pure.’</p>
      <p>Do you think Tamar is being genuine?</p>
