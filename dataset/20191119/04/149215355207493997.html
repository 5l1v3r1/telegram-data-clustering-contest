      <h1>Trump's doctor says unannounced hospital visit was a 'planned interim checkup'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:58:54+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/authors/catherine-garcia" target="_blank">Catherine Garcia</a></address>
      <p>Hoping to end speculation about President Trump's <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879113/trumps-routine-partial-physical-exam-walter-reed-actually-seems-little-abnormal">surprise weekend visit</a> to Walter Reed Medical Center, the White House <a href="https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1196622001982623744">released a memo</a> on Monday night written by Trump's physician, who said the "trip was kept off the record" due to "scheduling uncertainties."</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Trump underwent a "routine, planned interim checkup as part of the regular, primary preventative care he receives throughout the year," <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/politics/trump-doctor-health-walter-reed-visit/index.html">Dr. Sean Conley said.</a> Trump has "not had any chest pain, nor was he evaluated or treated for any urgent or acute issues," he continued. "Specifically, he did not undergo any specialized cardiac or neurologic evaluations."</p>
      <p>When a president or other notable person visits Walter Reed, staffers are usually notified ahead of time, people familiar with the matter told CNN, and this didn't happen on Saturday. Several doctors who treated former presidents and vice presidents said they found the unannounced hospital visit worrisome, including Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a cardiologist who treated former Vice President Dick Cheney. "It's concerning that there hasn't been any transparency in what occurred on Saturday," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnDDCrC4E3Q">he told CNN before the memo was released.</a></p>
      <p>In the memo, Conley said next year, he will put together a report with a full summary of Trump's labs and exam. With the president's consent, Conley did share Trump's cholesterol numbers, <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/823955/trump-gained-weight-but-still-good-health-doctor-says">which are down from earlier this year.</a></p>
