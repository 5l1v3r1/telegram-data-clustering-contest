      <p>Earlier, a bushfire in Perth’s southern suburbs has been brought under control by firefighters.</p>
      <p>A ‘bushfire advice’ alert for the southern part of Banjup remains in place from emergency services.</p>
      <p>The fire started about 12.10pm on Monday near Springfields Close in Banjup and affects people in an area bounded by Oxley Road, Wolfe Road and Liddelow Road.</p>
      <p>DFES said the alert level for the fire had been downgraded as fire conditions had improved.</p>
      <p>“There is no threat to lives or homes. Although there is no immediate danger you need to be aware and keep up to date in case the situation changes,” DFES said.</p>
      <p>Firefighters are patrolling the area and mopping up now the blaze is contained and under control.</p>
      <p>Locals are being urged to stay alert and monitor surroundings, and watch for signs of a bushfire, especially smoke and flames.</p>
      <p>If you do not have a plan decide what you will do if the situation gets worse.</p>
