      <h1>Intel unveils new GPU architecture and oneAPI software stack</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:17:19+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:17</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Tsai, DIGITIMES, Taipei</a></address>
      <p>Intel, addressing the increasing use of heterogeneous architectures in high-performance computing, has announced a new category of discrete general-purpose GPUs optimized for AI and HPC convergence.</p>
      <p>Unveiled at Supercomputing 2019, the general-purpose GPUs are based on Intel's Xe architecture. Code-named "Ponte Vecchio," this new high-performance, highly flexible discrete general-purpose GPU is architected for HPC modeling and simulation workloads and AI training, Intel said.</p>
      <p>Ponte Vecchio will be manufactured on Intel's 7nm technology and will be Intel's first Xe-based GPU optimized for HPC and AI workloads. Ponte Vecchio will leverage Intel's Foveros 3D and EMIB packaging innovations and feature multiple technologies in-package, including high-bandwidth memory, Compute Express Link interconnect and other intellectual property.</p>
      <p>Intel said its data-centric silicon portfolio and oneAPI initiative - also unveiled at Supercomputing 2019 - lays the foundation for the convergence of HPC and AI workloads at exascale within the Aurora system at Argonne National Laboratory. Aurora will be the first US exascale system to leverage the full breadth of Intel's data-centric technology portfolio, building upon the Intel Xeon Scalable platform and using Xe architecture-based GPUs, as well as Intel Optane DC persistent memory and connectivity technologies.</p>
      <p>The compute node architecture of Aurora will feature two 10nm-based Intel Xeon Scalable processors (code-named Sapphire Rapids) and six Ponte Vecchio GPUs. Aurora will support over 10PB of memory and over 230PB of storage. Aurora will leverage the Cray Slingshot fabric to connect nodes across more than 200 racks.</p>
      <p>The oneAPI industry initiative delivers a unified and simplified programming model for application development across heterogeneous processing architectures, including CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and other accelerators, Intel said.</p>
      <p>Intel said oneAPI delivers a unified and open programming experience to developers on the architecture of their choice without compromising performance and eliminating the complexity of separate code bases, multiple-programming languages, and different tools and workflows. It preserves existing software investments with support for existing languages while delivering flexibility for developers to create versatile applications.</p>
      <p>Intel's oneAPI beta software provides developers with a portfolio of tools that include compilers, libraries and analyzers, packaged into domain-focused toolkits. The initial oneAPI beta release targets Intel Xeon Scalable processors, Intel Core processors with integrated graphics, and Intel FPGAs, with additional hardware support to follow in future releases.</p>
