      <p>Cricket history is full of best and worst performances but Australia’s domestic tournament Marsh Cup witnessed something unusual. Tasmania’s all-rounder Gurinder Sandhu scored his highest List A score against Queensland on Monday and his innings helped his team win as well. However, the way he got out was hilarious and unacceptable for any team. Sandhu produced one of the worst run-outs we have ever seen as he was dismissed for 51.</p>
      <p>His previous List A high-score of 21* was well in the rear-view mirror as he and James Faulkner put on an important partnership for Tasmania. On 49, Sandhu pushed a ball out to mid-wicket, bringing up his half-century and even taking a second run. The pair went for the third and Sandhu got home comfortably, except for one thing. He forgot to slide his bat or ground his foot over the line. It produced this highly embarrassing footage that Sandhu surely won’t live down any time soon.</p>

      <p>Having seen the scene, former Australian captain Allan Border was shocked by the incident but was also quick to sympathise with Sandhu. “I’ll tell you what this would deserve an uppercut if this is run out,” Border said on Fox Sports commentary. “Oh Gurinder Sandhu, what are you doing? Don’t worry about someone else giving him an uppercut, give yourself an uppercut Gurinder because that’s just dumb cricket. You’d give an under ten kid a kick up the backside for that. No point saying too much right now, later on, you might sit him down.”</p>
