      <p>The United Kingdom (UK) said it is concerned by the escalating violence from both police and protesters occupying university campuses in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>A Foreign Office spokesperson made this known in a statement yesterday.</p>
      <p>“The UK is seriously concerned by the escalation in violence from both the protestors and the authorities around Hong Kong university campuses,” the spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>The autonomous Chinese city’s Polytechnic University became a scene of tumult on Sunday when protesters holed up inside threw petrol bombs and fired arrows at the police.</p>
      <p>The police responded with tear gas and water cannon.</p>

      <p>The police denied media reports that they had tried to enter the campus in a pre-dawn raid.</p>
      <p>Several protesters have been arrested while trying to run from a Hong Kong university campus surrounded by police.</p>
      <p>Around 100 people tried to leave the Polytechnic University, but were met with tear gas and rubber bullets.</p>
      <p>In the past week, the campus has turned into a battleground as long-running anti-government protests become more violent.</p>
