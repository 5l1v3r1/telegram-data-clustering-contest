      <h2>Mauricio Pochettino sack rumours and Tottenham's January transfer plans are in our round-up of the biggest Spurs stories</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lee Wilmot</a></address>
      <p>The final international break of 2019 is more than halfway through now and a hectic period of club football is nearly upon us.</p>
      <p>Can you feel the excitement?</p>
      <p>For Tottenham fans there will probably not be too much to get excited about, given the club's poor form, but a busy schedule could be just what they need to get out of their current predicament.</p>
      <p>Games wil be coming thick and fast and manager Mauricio Pochettino will need to use all his experience to get Tottenham out the other side of this rut and firing on all cylinders.</p>
      <p>Here we take a look at the biggest stories from around Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in the past 24 hours.</p>
      <h3>Pochettino sack rumours</h3>
      <p>With Mauricio Pochettino under increasing pressure at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, there are always going to be rumours about his job.</p>
      <p>Is his position as manager safe in N17?</p>
      <p>No manager's job is ever truly safe, and with Tottenham way back in 14th place in the Premier League table, with three wins from their opening 12 games, the Argentinian will be looking over his shoulder.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>There have, however, already been rumours that Pochettino has been sacked, following an alleged run-in with chairman Daniel Levy.</p>
      <p>It was a story that was doing the rounds on social media and even led to bookmakers slashing odds on Pochettino being the first Premier League boss to leave this season.</p>

      <h3>New role for Winks</h3>
      <p>There was something of a surprise in the England teamsheet for the final Euro 2020 qualifying clash with Kosovo on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>It was not the fact that Harry Winks was chosen to play, but the number he was given for the clash - 10.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Winks is not a number ten, but true to his shirt number he only went and bagged the first goal in a 4-0 win.</p>
      <p>Could it open the door for a more forward-thinking role at Tottenham?</p>

      <h3>January transfer plans</h3>
      <p>Tottenham supporters will be hoping their team are busy in the transfer market in January.</p>
      <p>There is little more than a month to go before the transfer window re-opens and Spurs are in need of reinforcements.</p>

      <p>But while the club may not be keen to spend big money in the winter window, there are plenty of players whom they could start speaking to ahead of a free transfer next summer.</p>

      <h3>Hugo Lloris update</h3>
      <p>Goalkeeper and Tottenham captain Hugo Lloris has not been in action since the beginning of October.</p>
      <p>The France skipper dislocated his elbow in making the mistake that put Brighton in front, in what turned out to be a dismal 3-0 defeat.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>He has been ruled out since the new year, with Paulo Gazzaniga deputising in his place.</p>
      <p>And Lloris has opened up on the "unbearable" pain he found himself in as he undergoes rehab.</p>
