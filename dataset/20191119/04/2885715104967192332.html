      <h1>WWE RAW Results: Triple H invites Kevin Owens to NXT</h1>
      <h2>Seth Rollins wagered his Survivor Series captain's spot on Team RAW against Andrade, Becky Lynch teamed up again with longtime rival Charlotte Flair, and RAW ended in an all-out brawl between all three brands.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:47:44+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/sports-desk/" target="_blank">Sports Desk</a></address>
      <p>After allowing the two former NXT Champions Kevin Owens and Drew McIntyre to duel to a stalemate, The Game reared his head to essentially stop the match and lay the groundwork to potentially turn Owens from Team Raw to NXT.</p>
      <p>The King of Kings said that he never had any issues with KO during the former NXT Champion’s backstabbing, brutally ambitious days under Triple H in NXT’s infancy.</p>
      <p>Luckily for Owens, the choice was made for him when Cedric Alexander, Ricochet, Mojo Rawley and Buddy Murphy sprinted down the ramp to equalise the NXT contingent, and The Undisputed ERA’s attack of KO put any negotiations to a halt.</p>
      <p>The O.C. hit the scene to finally turn the tide in favor of Raw by chasing off Undisputed ERA, and while the NXT collective’s retreat seemingly prevented Owens from joining them, it oddly made Triple H’s point all the same. NXT takes care of its own.</p>
