      <p>THE Ebola vaccination campaign in Congo is neither insufficient nor does it suffer from shipping delays, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Monday.</p>
      <p>The explanation came after criticism from medical aid group Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</p>
      <p>The group on Monday said the UN health agency is not transparent enough.</p>
      <p>Calling for an increased pace of immunisation, MSF also charged that only a fraction of the eligible population is benefiting from the current vaccine because the WHO imposes strict eligibility criteria and limits the number of doses.</p>
      <p>“The criticism that the number of people vaccinated is not sufficient is not backed by data,” WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said in Geneva.</p>
      <p>The WHO is carrying out a so-called ring vaccination, targeting all people, who had contact with infected persons.</p>
      <p>Infections have stopped within one or two weeks after ring vaccinations, according to Chaib.</p>

      <p>The haemorrhagic fever has infected more than 3,000 people and killed at least 2,000 since an outbreak was declared 13 months ago in Congo’s volatile Eastern region.</p>
      <p>The WHO declared the outbreak an international health emergency in July, after the disease spread to Goma, a major urban centre near the border with Rwanda.</p>
      <p>The UN agency pointed out that it cannot send all available vaccines to Congo, because emergency stocks are needed in case the virus spreads to neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p>In addition, vaccines cannot be sent to the field in large volumes, as any interruption of the cold chain would destroy many doses.</p>
      <p>More than 223,000 people have been immunised so far.</p>
