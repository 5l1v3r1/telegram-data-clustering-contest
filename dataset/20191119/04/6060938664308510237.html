      <p>Arbaaz Khan's love life post his divorce with Malaika Arora has always been in the limelight. After a lot of speculations, finally, Arbaaz accepted his love relationship with this Italian model, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Georgia-Andriani">Georgia Andriani</a> and the two are going strong with their affair. Interestingly, Arbaaz's girlfriend Georgia will soon debut in Bollywood with 'Welcome to Bajrangpur' starring <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shreyas-Talpade">Shreyas Talpade</a>, Sanjay Mishra, and Tigmanshu Dhulia. In an exclusive chat with Georgia, she talked about her debut film, boyfriend Arbaaz and the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Khan">Khan</a> family.</p>
      <p><b>1. Tell us something about your film 'Welcome to Bajrangpur'? how excited are you about it?<br/></b>It’s a very entertaining comedy, about an NRI that comes to India on holidays and ends up adopting a whole village, and about the whole reaction of the village to this new arrival. I'm looking forward to starting the shoot and I am feeling blessed to debut in Bollywood with such a great cast. It will be a lot of fun for us in the making and surely for the audience once the film is complete.</p>
      <p><b>Was Bollywood always your dream and how has Arbaaz Khan helped you in this journey?<br/></b>Arbaaz supports my independence and my right as a woman to be successful, which is a great trait in him. Watching Bollywood classics has been my passion for a few years already however Arbaaz has shown me so many more films and songs from which I’ve learned so much about Bollywood acting styles and how it has evolved in years.</p>
      <p><b>You always wanted to become an actress?<br/></b>When I was asked as a child I would always say that I want to become an actress, in fact, films and drama ended up being part of my studies and preparation.</p>
      <p><b>You recently met Arbaaz's son for a lunch date, how is your rapport with him?<br/></b>- I’ve met <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arhaan">Arhaan</a> many times and we get along well. Not only is he is growing as a very good looking boy, but he’s also very intelligent and has a great sense of humor and I’m sure he’s going to have a bright future.</p>
      <p><b>How has the Khan family welcomed you to their family<br/></b>The Khan family has welcomed me very well.</p>
