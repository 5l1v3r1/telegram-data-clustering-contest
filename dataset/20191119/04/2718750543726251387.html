      <h1>MSNBC’s <i>Hardball With Chris Matthews</i> Claims Gargantuan On-Air Fart Sound Simply a Mug Moving</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:59:22+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:59</time> by <a rel="author">Halle Kiefer</a></address>
      <p>Living out our collective modern nightmare in real time, Representative Eric Swalwell (D-CA) found himself engulfed in a potent, lingering scandal on Monday night. While a guest on MSNBC’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/hardball-with-chris-matthews/"><i>Hardball With Chris Matthews</i></a>, Swalwell’s thoughts on President Trump’s ongoing <a href="http://nymag.com/tags/impeachment/">impeachment hearings</a> were interrupted by what sure sounded like a deafening fart sound. Almost <i>too</i> deafening. Would an actual fart be so perfectly amplified? Where would a microphone have to be to capture a human toot with such crystal clarity?</p>

      <p>Swalwell, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, quickly denied letting one rip to BuzzFeed News. “It was not me!!!!!” he replied to reporter Addy Baird when <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/addybaird/eric-swalwell-denies-fart-msnbc-chris-matthews">contacted about the sound</a>. “Ha. And I didn’t hear it when I was speaking.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <i>Hardball</i> issued an official explanation and/or denial of their own. “Sorry to disappoint the conspiracy theorists — it was the #hardball mug scraping across the desk,” the show’s <a href="https://twitter.com/hardball/status/1196639020056494081">official Twitter account declared</a>, along with a link to said mug. “Get yours today and let’s get back to the news!” Swalwell <a href="https://twitter.com/RepSwalwell/status/1196641189476421632">replied to the tweet</a>, “TOTAL EXONERATION.” So, who is the true culprit behind <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FartGate?src=hashtag_click">#Fartgate</a>: Swalwell or that poor, innocent <i>Hardball </i>mug? Or is this all a ruse to protect the real perpetrator: <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/chris-matthews/">Chris Matthews</a> himself?</p>
