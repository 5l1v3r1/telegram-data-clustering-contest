      <p>Some people just have all the luck.</p>
      <p>Case in point: Ben Patz.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old bettor and college kid has run into a string of luck that netted him $672,000 on four parlays in the last three weeks, <a href="https://www.actionnetwork.com/news/sports-bettor-wins-huge-parlay-ben-patz-darren-rovell">according to Action Network.</a></p>
      <p>He wasn’t done winning ridiculous amounts of money as this weekend he kept the good times flowing.</p>
      <p>Check out his recent wins as well as past wins:</p>
      <blockquote>“Last month, Patz hit a $1,800, 15-leg parlay for $239,000. This weekend, he hit a $7,000 13-leg parlay and won $333,000 when the New England Patriots beat the Philadelphia Eagles.<br/><br/>When Patz turned 18 he says he opened an account offshore and bet $90 on Floyd Mayweather to beat Manny Pacquiao. He says he developed a big bankroll, took a break while in France for a year-and-a-half and came back and eventually lost it all.<br/><br/>About three years ago, he says he won a 12-team parlay and netted about $75,000, but it was on an illegal offshore site and only managed to get $12,000 out.<br/><br/>But it’s only recently that Patz landed on the radar of the sports betting world.<br/><br/>On Oct. 14, Patz says he bet $19,000 on the Packers moneyline. Green Bay won by one in regulation on a Mason Crosby field goal as time expired. “It really made me think about it,” Patz said. “Teams aren’t trying to cover, they are trying to win. And so it got me more comfortable with the moneyline.”<br/><br/>That’s when the run started.<br/><br/>On Oct. 27, Patz won $239,000. On Nov. 1, his $25,000 three-team parlay netted him $47,000. On Nov. 7, a $20,000 four-team parlay hit for $53,000. And then on Nov. 17, he won $333,000.”</blockquote>

      <p>Patz states that the bankroll that he has comes all from him and he’s not some trust fund baby.</p>
      <p>He also spoke about his losses as well, losing $45k on a 3-team parlay after the Trail Blazers lost a big lead to the injury riddled Golden State Warriors. The following day, he lost $30K on a 7-team parlay when Alabama lost to Penn 81-80.</p>
      <blockquote>“No Curry, no Draymond, no Klay, no D’Angelo,” Patz said. “Got beat by the G-League Warriors.”<br/><br/>“Alabama got fouled with two seconds left, down by one” Patz recalled. “Its best player missed two free throws and the Tide lost.”</blockquote>
