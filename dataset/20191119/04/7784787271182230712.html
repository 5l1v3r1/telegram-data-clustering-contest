      <h3>Collingwood coach Nathan Buckley has confirmed a seven-year mega deal is on the table for superstar ruckman Brodie Grundy.</h3>
      <p>The dual All-Australian is currently travelling through Colombia, after trekking Machu Picchu in Peru earlier this month, following a dominant season that culminated in his second consecutive Copeland Trophy.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old is out of contract at the end of next season and has previously admitted he has been tempted by the prospect of moving back to South Australia.</p>

      <p>The Herald Sun reported last week that Grundy has agreed to terms to remain at the Holden Centre, where he could finish his career, with an announcement potentially to come when he returns from South America in December.</p>
      <p>It would be the first of four major signatures Collingwood will aim to secure in 2020, with skipper Scott Pendlebury, Jordan De Goey and Darcy Moore all out of contract at the end of next season and all expected to command deals of up to $1 million per season.</p>

      <p>Buckley revealed the Magpies had been forced to increase the length of the deal after reaching an impasse with Grundy’s management earlier this year, but will be able to structure the payment to try and fit in Collingwood’s other big names.</p>
      <p>“We’re still in discussions. I think we’ve tabled another offer back to the management.</p>
      <p>“I think Brodie might be in Colombia at the moment, so he is doing what Brodie does in the off-season. We will get to that in due course, there is no doubt.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been confident all along that we’ll get to an agreement that suits both parties. There has been a bit of give on both sides. Pretty confident that will get down in due course.</p>
      <p>“It [a seven-year deal] wasn’t our starting position, but I think what it provides is a little bit of space. Brodie’s management has indicated that they are keener to do this. It just allows us to manipulate where the money goes across the seven-year term.</p>
      <p>“My greatest concern is not how many years we can have him for, it’s the quality of what he can bring us and has brought us over his tenure at the football club.”</p>

      <p>Grundy has established himself as the premier ruckman in the competition across the past two years, where he has averaged 41.2 hit-outs, 20.7 disposals, 12.9 contested possessions and 5.7 clearances from 50 games.</p>
      <p>Buckley doesn’t think the 132-gamer has reached his peak yet, which is a scary thought when you consider his output in the past 24 months.</p>
      <p>“One of the reasons other clubs look at him and see him as someone they’d love to have on their books – and why we’re so proud to have him on ours – is not just the quality of his football but the fact he’s very open minded,” Buckley said.</p>
      <p>“He wants to impact as much as he possibly can and there is still a lot of growth in us and in him. I look forward to seeing where we can take it.”</p>
      <p>Collingwood’s first to fourth-year players reported back for pre-season training on Monday morning, with star midfielder Dayne Beams spotted at the club as he works his way back from a difficult 2019.</p>
