      <p>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — A private liberal arts college in Minnesota is removing its founder’s name from a campus building after students brought attention to his racist views in the 1800s.</p>
      <p>The board of trustees for Macalester College in St. Paul announced Monday that Edward Duffield Neill’s name will be removed from Neill Hall, as well as from a room in another campus building. Neill Hall will be known by its former name, “Humanities Building,” until a committee chooses a new one.</p>
      <p>Macalester President Brian Rosenberg tells the Star Tribune the students’ extensive research into Neill’s racist writings prompted college leaders to act. Macalester’s student newspaper, the Mac Weekly, published a special issue last month that highlighted Neill’s racist writings about American Indians and his opposition to coeducation.</p>
      <p>Neill was a Presbyterian minister who was also Minnesota’s first Superintendent of Public Instruction and the University of Minnesota’s first chancellor.</p>
