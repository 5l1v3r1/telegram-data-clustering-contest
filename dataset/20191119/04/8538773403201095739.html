      <p>Smart appeared to land awkwardly on his right foot at around the 9 minute mark as he was guarding <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136193/devin-booker">Devin Booker</a> along the baseline. He immediately waved for help after going down and limped off the court with assistance from medical personnel. He did not return.</p>
