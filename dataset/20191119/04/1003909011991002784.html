      <p>In an 8-6 vote, city council voted Monday evening to move ahead with public engagement on neighbourhood speed limits.</p>
      <p>The public engagement process, which will cost about $200,000, will include multiple options for reducing speed limits on residential and collector roads.</p>
      <p>In a defeated motion, Coun. Peter Demong proposed that the public engagement process be put on hold for two years to save costs.</p>
      <p>Coun. Druh Farrell said at least two pedestrians were hit on city streets Monday.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a human emergency on our streets that we somehow are treating like it’s normal,” she said.</p>
      <p>Mayor Naheed Nenshi said he thinks “it’s worth seeing what the citizens think about it and then just making a decision once and for all.”</p>
      <p>City staff say traffic collisions are currently costing the city around $1.2 billion per year.</p>
