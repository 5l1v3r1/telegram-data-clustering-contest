      <p>A building at the Elizabeth TAFE campus has been evacuated following a series of “reckless” arson attacks this morning, concerning police ahead of catastrophic fire danger. Picture: 10 News</p>
      <p>Emergency services arrived at the campus on Woodford Rd just after 10am, responding to a fire in an asbestos-laden toilet block.</p>
      <p>MFS crews extinguished the fire, but the toilet block will need to be demolished.</p>
