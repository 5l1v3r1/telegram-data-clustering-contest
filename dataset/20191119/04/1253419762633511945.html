      <h1>AMD Radeon Software Adrenalin 2019 Edition 19.11.3 is optimized for Fortnite DX12</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:39:14+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:39</time> by <a rel="author">John Papadopoulos</a></address>
      <p>Epic Games has announced that Fortnite will be getting official DirectX 12 support. Although there isn’t an exact date yet on when patch 11.20 will come out, AMD has already released a new driver for its graphics cards. And as you may have guessed, this driver offers optimal performance in Fortnite DX12.</p>
      <p>As Epic Games stated:</p>
      <blockquote>“By using DX12, PC players with high-end GPUs may experience a higher and steadier frame rate. This is because DX12 delivers better CPU performance and allows for the distribution of rendering jobs across multiple cores.”</blockquote>
      <p>Unfortunately, the AMD Radeon Software Adrenalin 2019 Edition 19.11.3 driver does not bring any additional improvements or fixes. From the looks of it, the driver also has the same known issues as the previous version. So yeah, don’t expect any improvements or fixes for other games.</p>
      <p>You can download the AMD Radeon Software Adrenalin 2019 Edition 19.11.3 driver from <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-19-11-3">here</a>. Below you can also find its complete changelog.</p>
