      <p>The unfinished, purple-headed Lotus Tower soars uselessly into the Colombo sky, mired in corruption allegations -- a project typical of China's misadventures in Sri Lanka under a political dynasty that has just returned to power.</p>
      <p>With the Rajapaksas clan now back, Beijing will likely be too, experts say.</p>
      <p>On Monday Gotabaya Rajapaksa was sworn in as president, almost five years after his brother Mahinda's decade in charge ended in ignominy in 2015 as allegations of corruption and nepotism surfaced.</p>
      <p>Under Mahinda, who may become prime minister, Sri Lanka secured almost $7 billion in loans from China, dislodging Japan as Sri Lanka's main funder of infrastructure.</p>
      <p>But many of the projects have proven to be white elephants, including a $210-million airport that has no commercial flights.</p>
      <p>In 2016 troops had to shoo away deer, wild buffalo and elephants from the site.</p>
      <p>China also financed a 35,000-seat cricket stadium which seldom hosts matches, a performing arts centre in Colombo with few shows and a misfiring power plant.</p>
      <p>Some of the money was allocated under Beijing's gargantuan Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) spanning Asia and beyond and aimed at facilitating trade.</p>
      <p>Western countries worry that the BRI conceals China's efforts to expand its influence by loaning nations money only to acquire the assets when they cannot repay.</p>
      <p>Hambantota port in southern Sri Lanka, situated on a key maritime trading route between Europe and Asia, is for critics a prime example.</p>
      <p>In December 2017, Sri Lanka was forced to hand the port over to China on a 99-year lease after failing to service a $1.4-billion debt from Beijing to build it.</p>
      <p>- Corruption claims -</p>
      <p>For the Rajapaksas, who together spearheaded the brutal crushing of Tamil separatists in 2009 -- with allegedly 40,000 civilians killed -- China also came in handy in other ways.</p>
      <p>"What the Chinese offered to a regime that was being chastised for its human rights record... was international diplomatic protection as well the funds for development," analyst Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu told AFP.</p>
      <p>China meanwhile got a potential strategic toehold, right in India's backyard. In 2014, two Chinese submarines docked at Colombo.</p>
      <p>Many of the building projects, like the 350-metre (1,155-feet) Lotus Tower, have been accused of facilitating corruption.</p>
      <p>One of the two Chinese companies building the huge flower-shaped structure vanished with an advance of two billion rupees ($18 million), according to outgoing president Maithripala Sirisena.</p>
      <p>Reputedly South Asia's tallest free-standing communications tower, it is set to be opened soon -- but just for people to enjoy the view, since it's not functioning yet.</p>
      <p>The Rajapaksas say they had to borrow from China because credit was hard to come by elsewhere, and Akhil Bery from think-tank Eurasia said that there is some truth to this.</p>
      <p>Nor was it "all bad", Bery told AFP, with the Chinese-funded Colombo International Container Terminal "already profitable".</p>
      <p>- Beijing's orbit -</p>
      <p>After Mahinda Rajapaksa lost power in 2015, successive governments attempted to fix some of the projects and bring in capital from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>An agreement with China to build a vast commercial district on reclaimed land off Colombo port was renegotiated, and India is in talks about reviving the moribund airport.</p>
      <p>Sri Lanka is also negotiating a fresh military cooperation deal with the United States.</p>
      <p>But these may now be in danger again with the Rajapaksas back in power.</p>
      <p>Sri Lanka will again now "pivot more firmly into Beijing's orbit," Bery said.</p>
      <p>Financing from elsewhere, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, is available.</p>
      <p>"(But) China is Sri Lanka's largest investor and creditor, meaning that a close relationship with China is inevitable," Bery said.</p>
      <p>Still, said Jeff Smith, research fellow at US think-tank the Heritage Foundation, Gotabaya may have "learned some lessons from his brother's tenure".</p>
      <p>This includes "that he recognises the downside risks... of excessive dependency on China," Smith told AFP.</p>
