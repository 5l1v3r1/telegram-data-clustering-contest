      <h2>A round up of all things WBA from BirminghamLive</h2>

      <h3>True colours</h3>
      <p>Watford. Sunderland. Southampton. Aston Villa. West Bromwich Albion. Birmingham City. Blackpool. Crystal Palace. Leicester City. Derby County Stoke City.</p>
      <p>That’s quite a list of football clubs, though it wouldn’t take the avid football fan all too long to work who exactly the above CV belongs to.</p>
      <p>A Premier League Player of the Year award, a Carling Cup triumph and a Championship title to go with his eight England caps, Kevin Phillips had achieved quite a decorated career by the time he hung his boots up at Leicester City in 2014 and moved into coaching.</p>
      <p>Remembered nationally for his spell at Sunderland and his partnership with Niall Quinn, striker Phillips spent a sizeable portion of his playing days in the West Midlands.</p>

      <h3>Holding out</h3>
      <p>Former West Brom head coach Tony Pulis reportedly turned down the chance to return to management with Cardiff City - because the Welshman is holding out for a job in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Pulis left Albion in November 2017 after a run of three wins in 24 league matches spanning two separate campaigns, and has since had an 18-month stint in charge of Middlesbrough which involved two failed attempts at winning promotion from the Championship.</p>
      <p>Linked with the Cardiff vacancy recently, after the departure of fellow managerial stalwart Neil Warnock, the Sun claims that Pulis rejected the chance at jumping back into Championship life with the Bluebirds, because he fancies his chances at landing a top flight gig in the near future.</p>
      <p>Former Millwall manager Neil Harris was eventually appointed as Warnock’s successor and was unveiled to the press on Monday.</p>

      <h3>Dominant force</h3>
      <p>West Brom dominate matches more than all but two other teams in the Championship, analysis of passing stats has revealed.</p>
      <p>Slaven Bilic’s side have made 135 passes in their opponents’ third of the pitch in the league this season according to data from the CIES Football Observatory.</p>
      <p>Their opponents, meanwhile, have only had 90 passes in the Baggies’ third.</p>
      <p>That means <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Brom</a> have made 1.50 passes in the opposing team’s third of the pitch for every one pass of theirs.</p>
      <p>That’s the third highest ratio of any team in the Championship.</p>

      <h3>One or the other</h3>
      <p>The Championship title race is already a two-horse race between <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Brom</a> and Leeds United.</p>
      <p>That’s according to former footballer and radio pundit Alan Brazil, who deems the two sides in England’s second tier to be too strong for all else in the division.</p>
      <p>The two sides sit first and third respectively after 16 matches, either side of Preston North End, though Albion have a two-point cushion over the pair directly below them.</p>
      <p>Irrespective of North End’s exploits so far this term, ex-Scotland international Brazil says it’ll be the Baggies and the Whites at the top of the league come May.</p>

      <h3>Klich claim</h3>
      <p>Mateusz Klich reckons <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Brom</a> are ‘the best team’ in the Championship as the season prepares to resume.</p>
      <p>Leeds United midfielder Klich has, though, reiterated how unpredictable the division is with only five points separating the top six currently.</p>
      <p>Top of the league Albion have proven to be the most consistent outfit after the first third of the campaign, losing just one of their 16 matches to date - that, of course, was against Leeds.</p>
      <p>Polish international Klich says Albion are the best yet, but has reasoned that with such a start comes the pressure to maintain that form.</p>

      <h3>Albion consider offer</h3>
      <p>West Bromwich Albion are considering signing midfielder Chris Willock on a permanent deal.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old is currently spending the season on loan with the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Baggies</a> from Portuguese outfit Benfica. The loan agreement with Benfica includes an option for the deal to be made permanent for a “reasonable fee”.</p>
      <p>The report adds that Albion will continue to assess Willock before making a decision on whether or not to activate the option of making the deal permanent.</p>
      <p>Willock, who play in the attacking midfielder role or operate as a winger, is yet to make a first-team appearance since his move from Portugal.</p>
