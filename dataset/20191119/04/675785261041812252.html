      <h2>Huge swathes of koala bear habitat have been destroyed in the bushfires currently ravaging New South Wales and Queensland in Australia - but Border Collie-Koolie cross Bear is on hand to help</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:00:48+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>A dog with a heartbreaking back-story is helping to save koala bears in fire-stricken Australia.</p>
      <p>The pooch, called Bear, has been walking through the country's charred forests in search of the helpless herbivores.</p>
      <p>The dog wears special socks to protect him from the burnt ground and has been specially trained to sniff out koala poo and fur.</p>
      <p>Bear has bounced back from a tough start in life, after being abandoned by his owners because his obsessive compulsive disorder meant he did not like to play.</p>
      <p>However, Sunshine Coast University gave the Border Collie-Koolie cross a fresh start by taking him out of the rescue home and teaching him to scout for koala bears.</p>

      <p>   </p>
      <p>He is now believed to be the only dog in the world that can track the animals, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7699873/Adorable-dog-named-Bear-sent-bushfires-rescue-koalas.html">Mail Online</a> reports.</p>
      <p>The dog  and his handler have visited forests in New South Wales, Queensland and Cooroibah in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Animal charity IFAW campaigner Josey Sharrad told the  <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/bear-searches-scorched-bushland-for-surviving-koalas-20191118-p53bl5.html">Brisbane Times</a> : "Now, more than ever, saving individual koalas is critical.</p>
      <p>"With such an intense start to the bushfire season, it will be many weeks and months before some of these fires are out,' he said.</p>
      <p>"All the while, wildlife will continue to need to be rescued and treated, and might remain in care for some time. The road to recovery will be long."</p>
      <p>Firefighters have been filmed saving koala bears from the bushfires in recent days. </p>

      <p>Large areas of koala bear habitat have been destroyed in the blazes.</p>
      <p>Thousands of firefighters have been battling the flames in New South Wales and Queensland on the east coast for several days.</p>

      <p>At least six people have reportedly lost their lives in the natural disaster, with up of 1,600 individual bushfires stretching out across the states.</p>
      <p>Photos taken in New South Wales show orange and red clouds of heat swallowing up every inch of vegetation, structure and land that is visible in the frame.</p>
      <p>In apocalyptic seeming scenes fire tornadoes can be seen spinning and spewing out clouds of smoke, flames and debris.</p>
