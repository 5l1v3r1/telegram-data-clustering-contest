      <p>The Deputy Comptroller, CGC StrikeForce, Zone A, Deputy Comptroller Usman Yahaya, said that the seizure of the smuggled frozen poultry products was owed to a combination of the Unit’s intelligence and Enforcement capacity.</p>
      <p>He said smugglers were getting sophisticated and the customs has devised means that are more sophisticated in order to counter them in a renewed effort to give smugglers a run for their money.</p>

      <p>The Deputy Comptroller said it was very obvious that with the border closure, creeks would be their next options, but the officers are keeping vigil as the command will continue the onslaught until the smugglers retreat.</p>
      <p>Yahaya reiterated that the community relationship between the officers and villages along the coast has been of benefit to the success and it has come to stay.</p>
      <p>He added that the availability of operations tools and personnel motivation instills prompt response in the men whenever any alert was raised.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, he stated that NCSmaintains that the importation of frozen poultry products remained prohibited and that destruction of the products was in compliance with the Federal Government’s policy on imported poultry products.</p>
