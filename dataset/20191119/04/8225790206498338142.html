      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) -The city, the YMCA and a local school celebrated are celebrating a deal that will revitalize a troubled downtown park.</p>
      <p>Kamamalu Park is one of the city’s oldest parks, but in recent years, the park has suffered from under use and homelessness.</p>
      <p>Last month, the Y agreed to spend over $1.5 million to build a new comfort station, add a parking lot and expand the current lot. They are also going to improve landscaping and lighting.</p>
      <p>Central Middle school’s principal says the plan is great news.</p>
      <p>“Over the years there’s been some good times and there’s definitely been some struggle being able to balance those who are without a home and also the personal safety of our kids everyday,” Anne Marie Murphy, Central Middle School’s principal, said.</p>
      <p>The 150 parking stalls will be metered to generate revenue and to prevent the parking lots from being taken over by downtown workers.</p>
      <p>New uses will be found for the existing restroom, which is a historic structure, so it can’t be demolished.</p>
      <p>“My hope is that in the future, as we move forward, you’ll see keiki in here celebrating the great outdoors on weekdays and weekends,” Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell said.</p>
