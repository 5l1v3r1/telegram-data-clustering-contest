      <p>Kriti Kharbanda told ETimes, “No, they are not rumours. We are dating each other. In all honesty, I wanted my parents to know first that I’m dating someone and when you start seeing someone, it’s I think there’s a time for everything when you’re comfortable talking about it.”</p>
      <p>She added, “Sometimes it can take five years; sometimes it can take five months. In our case, it was five months, but I’m in a very happy place and I have no qualms admitting that I am dating Pulkit Samrat.”</p>
      <p>Well, we are very happy for the couple!</p>
      <p>On the work front, Kriti and Pulkit will be seen together in <i>Pagalpanti</i>. Directed by Anees Bazmee, the film also stars John Abraham, Anil Kapoor, Arshad Warsi and Urvashi Rautela. The film hits the screen on November 22, 2019.</p>
