      <p>NEW YORK -- A man charged with killing eight people on a New York City bike path spoke out at a pretrial hearing Monday, complaining that his prosecution was moving forward while no one was held accountable for the death of Muslims worldwide.</p>
      <p>Sayfullo Saipov, 31, remained quiet until the end of a federal court hearing meant to discuss issues relating to his upcoming trial. Then, he asked to speak.</p>
      <p>U.S. District Judge Vernon S. Broderick advised him he probably should express himself through his lawyers and he reminded him that anything he said could be used against him.</p>
      <p>Still, Saipov, speaking through an interpreter, insisted on addressing the court, saying there were multiple occasions "when the Muslims all over the world - the wives and the kids - (were) dying under the bombs of the American government."</p>
      <p>He added: "And you're judging me for the eight people killed and you're not judging the prosecutors when the thousands and thousands of Muslims are dying all over the world."</p>
      <p>The judge reminded Saipov that he was serving "like a referee" for the trial but that he would not be determining his guilt or innocence.</p>
      <p>Broderick also noted that he had allowed Saipov to speak at a hearing last year and he advised Saipov that his comments should be "saved for a different time."</p>
      <p>Saipov will have the opportunity at trial to testify. If he is convicted, he will be able to speak at a sentencing proceeding as well.</p>
      <p>Saipov has been held without bail since his arrest immediately after the attack in lower Manhattan on Oct. 31, 2017.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say Saipov deserves death for mowing over the victims with his truck.</p>
      <p>He moved to the United States legally from Uzbekistan in 2010. He lived in Ohio and Florida before joining his family in Paterson, New Jersey.</p>
      <p>His trial is scheduled for April.</p>
