      <p>DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Authorities in North Carolina have analyzed their response to a natural gas explosion that killed two people, injured two dozen others, leveled one building and damaged others, some of which have been condemned.</p>
      <p>The city and county of Durham last week released fire and emergency management reports that provide a timeline of the April 10 explosion since ruled accidental.</p>
      <p>Authorities were alerted to the smell of gas at the busy shopping district at 9:11 a.m. Finding nothing, responders left. A report of a cut gas line called them back about an hour later, and evacuations were underway when the gas ignited. The leak was stopped after another hour.</p>
      <p>The reports recommend improved coordination and increased staffing, training and standard compliance, such as those requiring fire personnel wear personal protective equipment.</p>
