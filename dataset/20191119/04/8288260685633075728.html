      <h3>Stockdale on Monk</h3>
      <p>David Stockdale insists he has no bad feelings towards former <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> manager Garry Monk.</p>
      <p>Monk made the decision to exclude Stockdale from first team training at Wast Hills in 2018 and replaced him with Lee Camp.</p>
      <p>Stockdale hasn’t started a Championship game for Blues since the 3-1 victory over Fulham on the final day of the 2017/18 season, with Monk banishing him to the under-18s a matter of weeks later.</p>

I said, ‘No worries,’ shook hands.</p>
      <p>“I was training with the under-18s, so I’d been cast aside, because he wanted his squad together. As a 33-year-old, training with kids, some who were younger than your own daughter, that can be a bit tough.”</p>
      <p>Blues were unable to offload Stockdale during that summer transfer window with several interested parties, including the goalkeeper’s boyhood club Leeds United, unwilling to match his salary at St Andrew’s.</p>
      <p>Instead, the goalkeeper became an emergency loan specialist and played seven games in League One for Southend, Wycombe Wanderers and Coventry City.</p>

      <p>“I was like Wonga — a short-term loan specialist,” Stockdale jokes. “Went to Southend (for two months), Wycombe (six weeks) and Coventry (a month). People were asking, ‘Why are you even bothering? You don’t have to. You are still getting paid’. But it’s the love of the game.</p>
      <p>“Chris Powell (the then-manager) at Southend, I was with him at Leicester. Gareth Ainsworth had a keeper crisis at Wycombe. Then Coventry came in, Mark Robins my old manager at Rotherham.</p>
      <p>“The Friday before my first game for Coventry was the worst training session of my career. People were saying, ‘This fella’s a trialist. This can’t be the right guy’. Then I kept two clean sheets in my two games and did really well. These are the things that get you through.”</p>
      <h3>More on Stockdale</h3>
      <p>David Stockdale has once again been linked with a move to Leeds United.</p>
      <p>Leeds-born <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/keen-leeds-united-linked-january-17271164">Stockdale has reportedly emerged as a target for Marcelo Bielsa</a> heading into the January transfer window with the Whites facing the prospect of a goalkeeper crisis.</p>
      <p>Undisputed number one Kike Casilla has an FA charge of using abusive and/or insulting words hanging over his head and has until November 27 to respond.</p>
      <p>Should the Spaniard receive a ban, Leeds would have to rely on untested duo Illan Meslier and Kamil Miazek.</p>
      <p>And, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/keen-leeds-united-linked-january-17271164">according to The People,</a> Leeds have reignited their interest in 34-year-old <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> goalkeeper Stockdale as a result.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Stockdale has only made one appearance for Blues this season with Lee Camp firmly Pep Clotet’s first choice between the sticks.</p>
      <p>Despite Clotet’s preference for Camp, Stockdale enjoys a good relationship with the former Leeds coach and they regularly joke about whether Blues should copy Bielsa’s methods.</p>
      <p>“We speak a lot,” <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/david-stockdale-reveals-two-word-17273246">Stockdale said.</a> “He’s a little bit of a Leeds fan as well (Clotet was on Garry Monk’s staff at Elland Road in 2016-17).</p>
      <p>“We speak a lot about Leeds and their methods and whether we should send a spy! He’s got good philosophies and how he wants to do it is the right way, he just has to develop that.”</p>

      <h3>Cowley looking forward to Blues</h3>
      <p>Huddersfield Town boss Danny Cowley is excited at the prospect of his side returning to action against Birmingham City this weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues</a> resume their Sky Bet Championship campaign on Saturday with an away trip to the John Smith’s Stadium in their first match after the November international break.</p>
      <p>Pep Clotet’s side are currently 13th in the league table and go into the weekend’s fixture against the Terriers on the back of a 1-0 defeat to Fulham last time out.</p>
      <p>Cowley and his Huddersfield players spent part of the international break at a week-long training camp in Dubai in order for the players to get more accustomed to the new manager’s methods.</p>

      <p>Huddersfield are only three points above the relegation zone, but results have been improving since Cowley replaced Jan Siewert in September.</p>
      <p>The Terriers' boss is hopeful that his side benefit from their trip to Dubai, as they prepare to face Clotet's Blues outfit.</p>
      <p>“We had a good week in Dubai and now we need to make sure that we get value for the hard work we had out there,” Cowley told the club’s website.</p>
      <p>He added: “We always love playing at home in front of our supporters, so we are looking forward to getting back to the John Smith’s Stadium come Saturday and giving our very best against a good Birmingham team.”</p>
