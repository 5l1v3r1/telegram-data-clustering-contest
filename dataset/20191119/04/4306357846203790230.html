      <h2>Chelsea FC are keen on a deal to sign Wigan starlet Joe Gelhardt, according to reports</h2>

      <h3>Chelsea FC are one of a number of clubs keeping a close eye on Wigan starlet Joe Gelhardt, according to reports in the British media.</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-join-man-utd-liverpool-20897626">Daily Star</a> is reporting that the Blues are keeping tabs on the 17-year-old striker in the lead-up to the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The same story says that Manchester United and City, Liverpool FC, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur have also been keeping a close eye on the teenage forward’s development in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Gelhardt has made seven Championship appearances for Wigan so far this season, all of which have come from the bench.</p>
      <p>Despite the reported interest from Chelsea FC, the story says that the Blues and other suitors only have a “slim” chance of being able to sign him in January.</p>
      <p>That’s because Wigan’s finances are thought to be in order and the club are under no pressure to sell as things stand.</p>
      <p>Gelhardt made his first team debut for Wigan at the age of 16 after having joined the club when he was 10.</p>
      <p>Wigan are said to value the young forward at around £5m, according to the same story.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Chelsea FC will be able to make any new signings in January as their Fifa transfer ban is still in place as things stand.</p>
