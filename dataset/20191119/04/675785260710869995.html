      <p>Liberal Democrats say they will hand the NHS a £35 billion boost by raising income tax a penny.</p>
      <p>The income tax increase would deliver £7 billion a year and be ring-fenced for use in the health service and social care, the party said.</p>
      <p>The money, delivered over five years, would complement party plans for a £10 billion capital fund to upgrade equipment, ambulances, hospitals and other NHS buildings, the party's health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said.</p>
      <p>Ms Berger pledged to tackle staffing shortages in the NHS by retaining free movement of labour, reinstating nursing bursaries and setting up a national workforce strategy to match training places to future needs.</p>
      <p>The party also said it would end the current shortfall of GPs by 2025, if they gain power.</p>
      <p>Ms Berger said: "The NHS is struggling to cope with severe staff shortages, chronic underfunding and crumbling hospital buildings.</p>

      <p>"All of these problems would be made much worse by a Tory or <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> that would end free movement and make it harder to attract nurses and doctors from the EU.</p>
      <p>"The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> will build a brighter future by stopping Brexit, and we will put a penny on income tax to raise an extra £35 billion for the NHS and social care.</p>
      <p>"We are the only party with a credible plan to protect the NHS, by tackling the staffing crisis, investing in mental health services, social care, public health and and making our NHS buildings fit for the 21st century."</p>

      <p>The 1p rise would apply to the basic, higher and additional rates of income tax, the party said.</p>
      <p>Of the £35 billion, £32.2 billion would be spent in England, £1.8 billion in Wales and £1 billion in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>The measure would not apply to Scotland as income tax policy is devolved.</p>
