        <b>BLAGOVESHCHENSK (Sputnik) – The city court of Blagoveshchensk arrested a college security guard on Tuesday for letting the student who carried out the deadly shooting last week into the college building, a Sputnik correspondent reports.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the investigators, the shooter carried his weapon past the college security guard in a backpack and then loaded the gun in a bathroom.</p>
      <blockquote>"The court ordered to hold [Oleg Ermolov] in custody for two months, until 14 January 2020", the judge announced at the Blagoveshchensk city court on Tuesday.</blockquote>
      <p>On 14 November, a 19-year-old student <a href="https://sputniknews.com/russia/201911141077305942-what-is-known-so-far-about-the-shooting-at-blagoveshchensk-college-russia/">opened fire inside the college</a> of construction and utilities in Blagoveshchensk, killing one person and injuring three others before taking his own life. The Russian Investigative Committee has opened a criminal case; according to preliminary results, the shooting occurred because of a personal conflict.</p>
      <p>Ermolov, who was on duty on the day of the shooting, said on Tuesday that he did everything possible.</p>
      <blockquote>"I do not consider myself guilty, I <a href="https://sputniknews.com/russia/201911141077304911-watch-first-video-of-shooting-aftermath-at-college-in-blagoveshchensk-russia/">did everything in my power</a>, brought people out, called the emergency people. I am not even an actual security guard, I don’t have a certificate", Ermolov said in court.</blockquote>
      <p>According to the Russian National Guard in the Amur Region, the guard who was on duty at the Blagoveshchensk college on the day of the shooting had a temporary document and was properly registered.</p>
      <p>On Monday, an official from the Ministry of Health of Russia’s Amur Region said that the condition of two of the three students <a href="https://sputniknews.com/russia/201911141077302600-person-killed-3-others-injured-in-shooting-in-russias-blagoveshchensk---authorities/">injured in the shooting</a> was improving.</p>
      <p>One of the students was going to be discharged from the hospital in the coming days, the official said.</p>
      <blockquote>Early on Tuesday, a college spokesperson said that classes have resumed as normal. </blockquote>
