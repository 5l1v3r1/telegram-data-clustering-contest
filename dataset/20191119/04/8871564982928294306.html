      <h1>Weak Q3 puts Thai economy on slowest path in 5 years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:15:35+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bangkok" target="_blank">Coconuts Bangkok</a></address>
      <p>The government this week downgraded its forecast for the economy, putting growth for 2019 at the slowest in five years.</p>
      <p>With third-quarter results showing a meager 2.4% growth yesterday, government economists revised growth projections for this year to 2.6% overall – a sharp decline from last year’s expansion of 4.1%. The office cited negative factors including the trade war, Brexit and appreciation of the baht all for putting the brakes on exports.</p>
      <p>It was the second GDP downgrade this year. In May, government economists <a href="https://coconuts.co/bangkok/news/growth-of-thai-economy-slows-to-5-year-low/">lowered their sights to 3.8%</a> from 4.5%. </p>

      </p>
      <p>A shaky post-election landscape, global slowdown and trans-Pacific trade conflict are being blamed for Thailand’s slowest quarter since 2014.</p>
      <p>Instead of growing, exports this year are expected to contract by 2% overall for 2019 – even more than the 1.2% previously predicted, according to Thosaporn Sirisamphand, sec-gen of the Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council. </p>
      <p>And achieving 2.6% overall growth is not a given. Thosaporn said fourth-quarter results must reach no less than 2.8% to do so.</p>
      <p>After lowering its Thai growth forecast to 3.5%, the IMF has now revised it down again to <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Countries/THA">2.9%</a>.</p>
      <p>Thailand’s economy has grown by an average of 3.5% since 1980, <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Countries/THA">according to the IMF</a>. It hit peaks in 2010 and 2012 with growth of 7.5 and 7.2, respectively. Meanwhile the most recent lull came in 2014 when growth only hit 1%.</p>
