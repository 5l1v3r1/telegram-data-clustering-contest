      <h3>Ripple Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>After forming an intermediate top near the $0.2660 level, ripple declined heavily against the US Dollar. XRP/USD broke many key supports near $0.2560 to move further into a bearish zone.</p>
      <p>Moreover, there was a close below the $0.2560 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It opened the doors for more losses and the price declined heavily below the $0.2500 level.</p>
      <p>The recent decline gained pace below the $0.2450 level and ripple tested the $0.2400 support area (<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/18/ripple-xrp-price-resuming-decline-bitcoin-breaks-8-5k/">as discussed in yesterday’s analysis</a>). A new monthly low was formed near $0.2399 and the price is currently correcting higher.</p>
      <p>It is testing the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2659 high to $0.2399 low. On the upside, there are many resistances near the $0.2540 and $0.2560 levels.</p>
      <p>Besides, there is a new connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.2530 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. Above the trend line, ripple price is likely to struggle near the $0.2580 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>More importantly, the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2659 high to $0.2399 low is likely to act as a strong resistance. Finally, yesterday’s highlighted bearish trend line is intact with resistance near $0.2620 on the same chart.</p>
      <p>On the downside, an immediate support is near the $0.2480 level. If the price starts a fresh decline below $0.2480, it is likely to test the $0.2420 and $0.2400 levels. Any further downsides depend whether bitcoin breaks the $8,000 support and continue lower.</p>
