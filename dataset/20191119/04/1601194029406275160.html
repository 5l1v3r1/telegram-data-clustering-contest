      <p>The Kansas City Chiefs recorded an important 24-17 win over the Los Angeles Chargers in Mexico City in the NFL on Monday.</p>
      <p>A pair of third-quarter touchdowns helped the Chiefs (7-4) past AFC West rivals the Chargers (4-7) at the Estadio Azteca.</p>
      <p>Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes improved in the second half and finished with 182 yards on the back of 19 of 32 completed passes with one TD and an interception.</p>
      <p>Travis Kelce led the Chiefs with 92 receiving yards, including a TD, in a key win for division leaders Kansas City, who had Tyreek Hill suffer a hamstring injury.</p>
      <p>Kelce became the fastest tight end in NFL history to reach 6,000 yards and 450 receptions, according to the Chiefs.</p>
      <p>Philip Rivers (28 of 52 for 353 yards with one TD) almost saw the Chargers to a late victory, but the QB threw his fourth interception in the dying seconds.</p>
      <p>After a first-quarter Michael Badgley field goal for the Chargers, the Chiefs took a 7-3 lead when Tyrann Mathieu intercepted Rivers, allowing LeSean McCoy to rush across from six yards for a TD.</p>

      <p>Badgley made two more field goals – either side of one from Harrison Butker – as the Chiefs took a 10-9 lead into half-time.</p>
      <p>Mahomes was better in the second half as the Chiefs scored twice to go ahead 24-9.</p>
      <p>Darrel Williams rushed over before Mahomes' 23-yard pass for Kelce saw the Chiefs take control.</p>

      <p>However, the Chargers responded when Rivers found Keenan Allen and a two-point conversion brought them back within seven.</p>
      <p>Rivers looked to lead the Chargers on a scoring drive late and a 50-yard pass to Mike Williams set up a potential TD, but the QB was intercepted again in the closing seconds.</p>
