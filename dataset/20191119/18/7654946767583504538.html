      <h1>Doctors warn of severe ‘feather duvet lung’ condition</h1>

      <p>Your feather comforter could make you seriously uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>A new study published Tuesday in the journal <a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/12/11/e231237">BMJ Case Reports</a> gives a close-up look at what it’s like to have a potentially debilitating condition called “feather duvet lung.”</p>
      <p>The report focuses on a 43-year-old man who sought medical help in November 2016 for chronic malaise, fatigue and breathlessness, which he said he’d been experiencing for about three months. The man was eventually diagnosed with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or feather duvet lung, an allergic reaction to the organic dust from the duck or goose feathers used in bedding.</p>
      <p>Doctors initially thought he had a lower respiratory tract infection — but then his symptoms worsened. A non-smoker in generally good health, he needed to take 14 days off work, most of which he spent sleeping. Doctors were dumbfounded, and the man says in the report his “rapid decline” and lack of proper diagnosis was “extremely distressing. I was unable to stand or walk for more than a few minutes at a time without feeling like I was going to pass out.”</p>
      <p>By December, his symptoms worsened even more. Simply walking between rooms in his home caused him to be breathless, yet a chest radiograph came back normal. Further testing, however, found avian antibodies in his blood, even though he owned no pet birds. What he did have, though, was new bedding: He and his wife had recently swapped their synthetic linens for a feather duvet and pillows.</p>
      <p>Doctors gave the man a course of steroids and had him remove the feather bedding. After three months of hell, relief came quickly.</p>
      <p>“His symptoms improved rapidly within the first month,” reads the study. “By [six] months, he felt completely well.”</p>
      <p>If undiagnosed, repeated exposure to feathers in bedding “may result in irreversible lung fibrosis,” the study warns. And frequently it is not identified, as healthcare professionals often fail to ask patients about the type of bedding they use.</p>
      <p>“This is an important omission since the use of feather, rather than synthetic, bedding is common,” write the study authors, noting that 7.6 million duvets were sold in the UK in the first four months of 2015 alone.</p>
      <p>The man in question, fortunately, was able to bounce back following his diagnosis and treatment.</p>
      <p>“I have not had any dizzy turns since recovering,” he writes. “It doesn’t affect me at all now, and my life is pretty much as it was before.”</p>
