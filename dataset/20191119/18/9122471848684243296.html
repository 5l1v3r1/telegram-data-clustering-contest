      <h1>Mike Tomlin Has Strong Comment On Incident With Browns</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:48:14+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>It’s not too often a <i>Thursday Night Football</i> is still getting discussed following a full weekend of football. The  Browns-Steelers fiasco isn’t going away any time soon, especially as Mike Tomlin’s team is set to play Cleveland again in just a few weeks.</p>
      <p>Myles Garrett’s actions will never be forgotten – some are calling his <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/cleveland-browns/video-myles-garrett-ejected-after-swinging-helmet-at-mason-rudolph">helmet swing on Mason Rudolph</a> one of the dirtiest things in the history of football. But several Steelers players took part in the brawl as well. There’s blame to be placed on both Rudolph and Garrett.</p>
      <p>It’s pretty clear that Rudolph played a role in the incident, but Pittsburgh head coach Mike Tomlin <a href="https://twitter.com/MaryKayCabot/status/1196843428371456001">doesn’t seem to agree</a>. In fact, he feels his team doesn’t have much to learn from the whole ordeal.</p>
      <blockquote>“I don’t know that we did anything to make it happen in the first place,” Tomlin told the media on Tuesday. “That’s why I said we didn’t have anything to learn from it.”</blockquote>

      <p>Video of the incident shows that Rudolph grabbed Garrett’s helmet, and appeared to try and take it off his head, before having the same thing happen to him. That doesn’t excuse Garrett’s actions, of course.</p>
      <p>This may not be the wisest response from the Steelers head coach. After all, Pittsburgh and Cleveland play again on Dec. 1. The last thing either team needs is another reason to start a fight.</p>
      <p>Even if Tomlin truly believes his team did nothing wrong, it’d be smart to state some accountability for the situation just from a PR perspective. But the Steelers coach is standing by his players, no matter the evidence of wrongdoing.</p>
