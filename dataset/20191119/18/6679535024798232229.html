      <h2>Petition filed at the behest of TDP, alleges Sridevi</h2>

      <p>Tadikonda MLA Vundavalli Sridevi will appear before the District Level Scrutiny Committee headed by the Joint Collector, Guntur, on November 26 as part of an inquiry into the allegations over her caste.</p>
      <p>“We have called both the parties for the inquiry. We will study the evidences. Basing on the inquiry, we will submit a report to the Chief Election Commissioner,” Joint Collector Dinesh Kumar has said.</p>
      <p>The Legal Rights Protection Forum had in September alleged that though Dr. Sridevi declared in the election affidavit that she belonged to the Scheduled Castes, the MLA later claimed that she was a “practising Christian.”</p>
      <p>The forum then had submitted representations to President Ram Nath Kovind and the Chief Election Commissioner.</p>
      <p>Rubbishing the allegations, Dr. Sridevi said that she belonged to the Scheduled Castes.</p>
      <p>“I have submitted all the certificates, which clearly state that I am an SC. I have submitted the certificates along with my election affidavit. I will also submit them before the District Level Scrutiny Committee,” Dr. Sridevi said.</p>
      <p>She further alleged that the forum had filed a petition against her at the behest of the TDP.</p>
      <p>“The TDP had tried to humiliate me by preventing my entry into the Ganesh pandal in August. It has been targeting me because I am not corrupt,” said Dr. Sridevi.</p>
