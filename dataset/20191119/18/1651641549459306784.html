      <p>Google today announced Your News Update, a new way to listen to personalized news via Google Assistant. You can try this today by changing the Assistant news settings. Once the setting is done, just say, “Hey Google, play me the news”, Your News Update will start playing the news audio which includes news stories curated based on your interests, location, user history and preferences, and also the current top news stories.</p>
      <blockquote>If you’re a Steelers fan who follows the stock market and lives in Chicago, for example, you might hear a story about the latest “L” construction, an analysis of last Thursday’s Steelers game and a market update, in addition to the latest national headlines.</blockquote>
      <p>If you continue listening, Google Assistant will start playing longer-form content based on your interests. In between stories, the Google Assistant will act as an host that introduces which publishers and updates are next.</p>
      <p>Your News Update feature is now available for English language users in the US. Google will bring this feature to other countries next year.</p>
