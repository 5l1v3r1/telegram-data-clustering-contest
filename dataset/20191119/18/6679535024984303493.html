      <p>The Bharatiya Janata Party, which enjoys majority in Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat, wrested total control of the panchayat body by getting its members elected to all the five standing committees on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>All the seven members in Finance, Agriculture and Industry, Education and Health and General standing committees are from the BJP. One member from the Congress figures in the seven-member standing committee on Social Justice.</p>
      <p>Members to the standing committees were hitherto being elected following consensus among the parties. Elections were held after the members failed to arrive at a consensus.</p>
      <p>The general meeting of the zilla panchayat was convened on Tuesday to elect new members to the five standing committees. While six members were to be elected for the standing committees for Finance and General that is headed by panchayat president Meenkashi Shantigodu and vice-president Kasturi Panja, both from the BJP, respectively, seven members were to be elected to the other three committees.</p>
      <p>The Congress, which has 15 members, demanded that 12 of its members be included in the standing committees, while the BJP, which has 21 members, initially offered 10 and then, agreed to 11. As the Congress members, led by senior member M.S. Mohammed, insisted on 12, the BJP, led by Ms. Panja, disagreed and moved forward for elections.</p>
      <p>All 21 members of the BJP and 13 of the 15 members from the Congress took part in the voting. Five of the seven BJP MLAs also voted. BJP MLAs from Puttur and Belthangady Sanjeeva Matandoor and Harish Poonja and MP Nalin Kumar Kateel were absent. Mangaluru MLA U.T. Khader and two MLCs Ivan Dâ€™Souza and Harish Kumar, all from Congress, and Janata Dal (S) MLC B.M. Farooq remained absent.</p>
      <p>A total of 44 members voted. The votes of all, except two who had voted for more members than desired, were counted.</p>
