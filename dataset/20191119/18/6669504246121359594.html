Canada's top water scientists say the country is kidding itself if it thinks it will always have plenty of fresh water when and where it's needed. In a report released today, the Global Water Futures project from 18 universities says Canadian water supplies are increasingly threatened by accelerating climate change and policies that haven't changed in decades.

      <p>HAMILTON - Canada's top water scientists say the country is kidding itself if it believes it will always have plenty of fresh water whenever and wherever needed.</p>
      <p>A report from the Global Water Futures project that involves 22 universities says Canadian water supplies are increasingly threatened by accelerating climate change and policies that haven't changed in decades.</p>
      <p>It says glaciers, the water tanks of the prairies, are disappearing and toxic algae are spreading in lakes.</p>
      <p>Floods and freak precipitation are changing water cycles from coast to coast.</p>
      <p>Scientists only have water-quality data for about one-third of the watersheds in the country.</p>
      <p>The report says water is governed by a patchwork of different jurisdictions using out-of-date legislation, and concludes that Canada's sustainable development policy is in a shambles.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 19, 2019.</p>
