      <p>Police special forces searched the apartment of the suspect in Berlin who had started to buy chemicals and other materials needed to build an explosive device, the general prosecutors' office said.</p>
      <p>"This (device) was meant to be detonated at an unknown time at an unknown location in Germany to kill as many people as possible," prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>The accused notably purchased acetone and hydrogen peroxide in recent months, they added. Both are key components in the highly explosive TATP.</p>
      <p>German police last Tuesday <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/germany-detains-3-islamic-state-suspects-over-attack-plan-12086794">detained three people</a> in the western city of Offenbach on suspicion of planning a bomb attack for the Islamic State militant group.</p>
