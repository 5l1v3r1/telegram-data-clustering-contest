        <figcaption><b>Trump's doctor dismisses health rumors<br/></b>U.S President Trump's health examination on Saturday was "routine" and he was not treated for any urgent or acute issues, his physician said in a statement on Monday. It comes after an unexpected trip to Walter Reed Medical Centre over the weekend sparked a variety of rumors. Jayson Albano reports.</figcaption>

      <p>“I was out of there very quickly,” Trump told reporters at the White House at the start of a meeting with his cabinet in his first public event since his examination on Saturday, adding that it was “a very routine, physical.”</p>
      <p>Trump’s visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington was not on his official public schedule that day, and the White House later said the president had undergone a quick exam and some laboratory tests.</p>
      <p>White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham afterward said Trump took advantage of a “free weekend” to get some of his annual exam completed ahead of an expected “very busy 2020,” but provided no details.</p>

      <p>Trump’s physician, U.S. Navy Commander Sean Conley, in a memo released by the White House late on Monday said the president was not treated for any urgent or acute issues and did not undergo any specialized cardiac or neurological tests.</p>
      <p>The president’s unexpected and unscheduled trip - months before the annual physical exam has been carried out in the past - prompted questions on social media about his health and a stern rebuke by the White House.</p>
      <p>Trump told reporters Tuesday that he would undergo the rest of the exam in January.</p>
