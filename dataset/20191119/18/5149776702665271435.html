      <p>Nottingham Forest return to Championship action this weekend against Bristol City - who could be set for an injury boost in time for the game.</p>
      <p>The Robins and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> are separated by two points and a single place in the table ahead of the Ashton Gate contest, with Lee Johnson's side winning seven and losing only twice in their opening 16 matches.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the game, City assistant head coach Dean Holden has given an update on his side's injury situation, with several players having been missing over recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Striker Benik Afobe (ACL injury) and left-back Jay Dasilva (fractured tibia) are both definite absentees for the Forest game - but Jack Hunt and Korey Smith are nearing returns and could be in contention.</p>

      <p>Defensive midfielder Smith is yet to feature this season after suffering a broken foot bone and ligament damage, with a 90-minute outing against Crystal Palace's under-23s on Monday pushing him closer to a return.</p>
      <p>"He’s had a great couple of weeks. He’s in a great place now," <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/smith-dasilva-hunt-latest-bristol-3554896">Holden told Bristol Live.</a></p>
      <p>"He's now in a recovery protocol. We’ll assess on Thursday who’s in and around the squad.</p>
      <p>"It’s a great story for Korey - such a likeable person around the place. He had a terrible time with his injuries but he’s on his way back now.</p>
      <p>"Seeing him out there smiling and moaning and refereeing decisions in training is a great sight! It really is.</p>
      <p>"He’s still got work to do with his fitness but a 70-minute and 90-minute run out after the time he’s out injured is a great return."</p>
      <p>Full-back Hunt, meanwhile, is on his way back from a hamstring injury that has kept him out since a 3-0 defeat to Luton Town on October 19.</p>
      <p>"He’s back on the grass again which is great," Holden said. "But we're not too sure yet if he’s going to feature on the weekend."</p>
