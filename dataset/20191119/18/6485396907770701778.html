      <p>Last season, the Chicago Bears were one of the NFL’s great success stories. Picked by our model <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nfl-2018-the-good-the-bad-and-the-browns/">to win just 6.6 games</a>,<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-bears-are-stumbling-after-a-playoff-run-yes-again/#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a> with only a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-nfl-predictions/">19 percent chance</a> of snapping the team’s seven-year <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/">playoff drought</a>, Chicago instead flourished under second-year quarterback Mitchell Trubisky and first-year Head Coach Matt Nagy. The Bears <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/2018.htm">went 12-4</a>, won the NFC North and were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y87uP3exFjc">mere inches away</a> from beating the defending champions in the playoffs. Nagy <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bears/matt-nagy-named-2018-coach-year">won Coach of the Year honors</a>, and going into 2019, Chicago seemed primed to build on its breakout — thanks to a staunch defense and further potential development from Trubisky.</p>
      <p>But things haven’t really gone according to that plan … because, let’s face it, they almost never do in the Windy City. The Bears’ 2019 campaign has been beset by the usual maladies: <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bears/ct-chicago-bears-eddy-pineiro-missed-field-goals-20191118-z2fjrqy5hvd3nlb3jqawbh2fde-story.html">kicking disasters</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bears/ct-chicago-bears-matt-nagy-kneel-field-goal-20191028-udzssm663zhnxkjdroahmr5b6q-story.html">coaching miscues</a>, <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2019/11/18/20970189/bears-mitch-trubisky-super-frustrated-right-hip-injury-matt-nagy-rams-17-7-final-score-quarterback">poor quarterbacking</a>, <a href="https://theathletic.com/1347639/2019/11/03/were-to-blame-has-the-bears-2019-regression-extended-to-the-defense/">defensive regression</a>, etc. After <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201911170ram.htm">losing</a> a potentially winnable slog against the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday night, Chicago’s playoff odds <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-nfl-predictions/">are down to 1-in-100</a>.</p>

      <p>We would ask how things got to this point, except that things <i>always </i>seem to get to this point for the Bears when seeking a return trip to the playoffs. <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/">Going back to the 1990s</a>, Chicago has repeatedly tried — and failed — to build on its breakout seasons, most of the time leaving fans bitterly disappointed instead. And, barring a miracle, this season looks like it will be no different.</p>
      <p>Let’s rewind a bit. The year was <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/1994.htm">1994</a>, and the Bears were two seasons removed from a run of seven playoff appearances in eight years, including a legendary <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198601260chi.htm">championship in 1985</a>. But they had gone 12-20 in 1992 and ’93, during which time the team officially moved on from both its head coach — longtime boss Mike Ditka — and quarterback — Jim Harbaugh, who’d shown flashes of talent but played miserably in 1993. Led by second-year Head Coach Dave Wannstedt and a <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-09-20/sports/9409200100_1_bears-dave-wannstedt-vinson-smith">combination of Steve Walsh and Erik Kramer</a> under center, Chicago turned things around with a <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/1994.htm">9-7 regular season</a> in ’94 and added a <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199501010min.htm">road playoff win</a> over the Minnesota Vikings before being dispatched by the eventual champion San Francisco 49ers.</p>
      <p>Poised to make a postseason return the following year with Kramer — who actually <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/qb/1995">had a tremendous 1995 season</a> — starting full time, Chicago started 6-2. But the Bears ultimately missed the playoffs on a tiebreaker after going 3-5 in the second half of the season, <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teameff/1995">undone by</a> special teams and (of all things) defense. The franchise wouldn’t make it back for the rest of the decade.</p>
      <p>That playoff drought was snapped in <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/2001.htm">2001</a>, when a QB nobody thought much of — Jim Miller, who had <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/2000.htm#all_passing">thrown fewer passes</a> for the 2000 Bears than the immortal Cade McNown or Shane Matthews — led a team <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2001/preseason_odds.htm">nobody thought much of</a> to a season nobody saw coming. That year’s Bears defense went from 20th in points allowed <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2001/opp.htm#team_stats::3">to first</a>, a feat made even more incredible by the team’s <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2001/opp.htm#passing::21">middling rankings</a> in <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2001/opp.htm#team_stats::6">more yardage-based metrics</a>. The Cinderella story <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200201190chi.htm">ended at home against the Eagles</a> in the playoffs, but <a href="https://www.si.com/vault/issue/704240/165">at least some observers</a> saw <a href="https://www.si.com/vault/issue/704240/147">another playoff trip in the cards</a> for 2002.</p>
      <p>Instead, the defense regressed <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2002/opp.htm#team_stats::3">back to 25th</a> in points allowed, Miller didn’t last the season as starting QB, and Chicago crashed back to earth with a <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/2002.htm">4-12 record</a>. The Bears would languish out of the playoffs for a couple more seasons <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/2003.htm">after</a> <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/2004.htm">that</a>, during which time the team burned through a succession of starting QBs that included Kordell Stewart, Craig Krenzel, Chris Chandler, Chad Hutchinson, Jonathan Quinn, Kyle Orton and Rex Grossman.</p>
      <p>Those last two names are where the story takes a turn, though, as part of the exception to the overall rule.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/2005.htm">2005 Bears</a> were another one of those underdog Chicago teams with an untested QB (Orton, standing in for the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=2132968">injured Grossman</a>) and a second-year head coach (Lovie Smith), about which <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2005/preseason_odds.htm">little was expected</a> aside from some hints of <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/2004_roster.htm#games_played_team::11">defensive promise</a>. They started the year 1-3, as Orton played poorly — but then, out of nowhere, they rattled off an eight-game winning streak as part of a stretch with 10 wins in the season’s final 12 games. The team once again <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2005/opp.htm#team_stats::3">led the league in scoring defense</a> — even <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamdef/2005">coming by it more honestly</a> than in 2001 — and it kept winning, even though Orton continued to struggle until Grossman’s return in Week 16. Despite going 10-5 as Chicago’s starter during the regular season, Orton was benched for the playoffs in favor of Grossman. But at home in the playoffs against the Carolina Panthers, Grossman <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200601150chi.htm">didn’t fare much better</a> than Orton had, and the Bears’ season ended in a 29-21 loss.</p>
      <aside>Yes, I had them ranked 22nd in my personal pre-2006 power rankings. Also: Wow, that was a long time ago.</aside>
      <p>Looking ahead to 2006, it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121018152519im_/http://images.wikia.com/openserving/sports/images/a/a5/Nflcapsules_nfcnorth.jpg">sure seemed like history repeating itself</a> from a few years earlier.<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-bears-are-stumbling-after-a-playoff-run-yes-again/#fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a> But <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/2006.htm">the ’06 Bears</a> actually did make it back to the playoffs — and even went as far as the Super Bowl before running into Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD0LNpdakCQ">on a rainy Super Sunday in Miami</a>. Though Grossman <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2006/passing.htm#passing::26">was a mediocre passer at best</a>, the Brian Urlacher-led defense <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2006/opp.htm#team_stats::3">repeated its top-five performance</a> in points allowed and helped the Bears make a rare postseason return before the wheels began to fall off <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/2007.htm">in 2007</a>.</p>
      <p>That was the start of a new three-year playoff drought for the club, but <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/2010.htm">in 2010</a> the Bears still had Smith as an experienced coach to go with QB Jay Cutler — who was <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=4037373">acquired from Denver</a> for Orton <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/03/sports/football/03cutler.html">and picks</a>, and who had something to prove after a <a href="http://www.bearshistory.com/seasons/2009chicagobears.aspx">terrible debut season</a> in Chicago. Cutler’s own 2010 <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CutlJa00/gamelog/2010/">was up and down</a>, but the Bears’ defense once again was terrific, allowing the <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2010/opp.htm#team_stats::3">fourth-fewest points</a> in the NFL, and the team finished 11-5. In the playoffs, Chicago <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201101160chi.htm">beat the Seattle Seahawks</a> before losing at home to the Green Bay Packers in an NFC championship game that <a href="https://www.espn.com/chicago/nfl/news/story?id=6054047">Cutler left early with a knee injury</a>.</p>
      <p>Would the Bears return to the playoffs <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/2011.htm">in 2011</a>? Of course they would not. Chicago started 7-3 before <a href="https://www.espn.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/7394127/began-ended-jay-cutler-injury">Cutler was injured again</a>, and the team went 1-5 down the stretch with a combination of Caleb Hanie and Josh McCown replacing Cutler under center. The Bears rebounded to go 10-6 <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/2012.htm">in 2012</a> but also became one of the <a href="https://www.profootballhof.com/news/fact-or-fiction-an-11-5-team-has-missed-the-playoffs/">rare NFL teams in history</a> to win double-digit games and miss the postseason. After that, they’d never muster anything better than an 8-8 record for the rest of the Cutler era, eventually missing the playoffs in seven straight seasons from 2011 to 2017.</p>
      <p>All of which brings us to 2019, when Chicago had its fifth chance since the mid-1990s to build on an unexpected playoff run with another postseason bid. And likely for the fourth time — 2006 being the sole exception — the team will fail to follow up on the breakthrough. The return rate for playoff teams since the NFL <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990%E2%80%9391_NFL_playoffs">expanded to its current format</a> in 1990 is 52 percent, and only 42 percent for teams coming from outside the postseason the year before. So naturally you would expect this phenomenon to happen multiple times to <i>some </i>team. But the Bears have done it so often, they’ve practically become the poster franchise for playoff teams <a href="https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/9/4/20849015/nfl-teams-that-could-miss-playoffs-rams-saints-bears-chargers">dropping out of the field the next season</a>.</p>

      <aside>Don&amp;#8217;t answer that.</aside>
      <p>The 2019 team happens to share some commonalities with Chicago’s previous stumbles. The defense, for instance, isn’t quite as dominant as it was last season — which seems to be a common flaw for these one-off Bears playoff bids. (Does the legacy of the ’85 Bears defense loom so large over the franchise that it must constantly try to rebuild in that team’s image?)<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-bears-are-stumbling-after-a-playoff-run-yes-again/#fn-3"><sup>3</sup></a> There’s <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/info/FO-basics">a lot of research</a> showing that defensive quality, while extremely important for team success, is also <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-nfl-cant-rely-on-defense/">extremely variable from season to season</a>, even with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3FSoPFHSuo">talent like Khalil Mack</a> on your side. So when your quantum leaps from obscurity into the playoffs are always reliant on dominating D, it’s no surprise to see a penchant for backsliding in subsequent seasons.</p>
      <p>But an interesting difference this year, as compared with earlier failed playoff returns, is at quarterback. Most of the other seasons involved Chicago starting with a low-rated QB who won despite poor passing. Often, these QBs would improve (or be replaced by a better option) in the follow-up bid, but it wouldn’t be enough to overcome the defensive regression. Trubisky, however, entered the 2019 season with an above-average QB Elo rating, which could only be said about quarterbacks in 19 Bears seasons since 1950 — and only three QBs since 1998 (including Trubisky).</p>
      <p>This appeared to be an argument in Chicago’s favor for returning to the postseason: that the 25-year-old’s ongoing development would provide insurance in case of a defensive slide. But instead, Trubisky’s underwhelming play (he ranks <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-nfl-predictions/quarterbacks/">27th in QB Elo</a> out of the 34 current and/or primary starters in the league) has stalled the Bears’ rebuilding process and called into question his <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-the-bears-look-for-a-new-quarterback/">long-term future with the team</a>.</p>
      <p>We don’t know where the Bears go from here. But even if they make it back to the postseason, say, next season, they’ll need to prove it’s not a one-year wonder — unlike basically every other Bears playoff run in the past three decades.</p>
