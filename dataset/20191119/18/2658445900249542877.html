      <h4>Precious Igbonwelundu</h4>
      <p>Lagos Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Tuesday flagged off Exercise Crocodile Smile IV with a charge to security agencies to flush pipeline vandals, pirates, kidnappers and armed robbers out of the state.</p>
      <p>He declared the exercise open shortly after watching a beach landing and counter terrorism simulation at the Takwa Bay Island in Iru-Victoria Island Local Council Development Area (LCDA).</p>
      <p>Sanwo-Olu who was represented by his deputy Dr. Obafemi Hamzat expressed concerns over the increase in pipeline vandalism recalling a recent incident at Abesan Estate that would have been disastrous but for timely intervention of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA).</p>
      <p>According to him, Exercise Crocodile Smile IV was a welcome development because it would check criminal minded individuals out to make quick money before the festivities.</p>
      <p><i>The Nation</i> reports that the exercise which was introduced by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai would serve both training and operational purposes for all security agencies participating as equipment and personnel have been put on standby to act real time, on any intelligence gathered.</p>
      <p>Sanwo-Olu said he was optimistic the exercise would ensure peace and security in the state during the yuletide, appealing to residents to cooperate with security agencies.</p>
      <p>The governor assured of the state’s commitment to provide needed support to the military, recalling the donation of 120 patrol vehicles and 35 motorcycles to security during his 100 days in office celebration.</p>

      <p>“On our part as a government, we will continue to make efforts to support the military to provide security in Lagos State as much as possible.</p>
      <p>“We doff our hats at your resilience and determination towards providing security in Lagos State despite difficult challenges. We applaud the responsiveness of the 9 Brigade of the Nigerian at clapping down on erring personnel of the military for disciplinary procedures whenever we find personnel defaulting on our laws.</p>

      <p>“With exercise Crocodile Smile IV coming onboard in the run up to Christmas and beyond, the prospects are very bright that Lagosians and I belief the good people of Ogun State will enjoy hitch-free 2019/2020 yuletide season.</p>
      <p>“I must not also forget to mention the civil-military cooperation activities that we are told this Exercise Crocodile Smile IV will engender. These activities to my mind, will serve to endear the military to the people.</p>
      <p>“It is our fervent hope that the Nigerian Army will also achieve its other cardinal objectives of Exercise Crocodile Smile IV, which is to sharpen the skills of participating troops in amphibious operations.</p>
      <p>“With 81 Division achieving its training and operational objectives of Exercise Crocodile Smile IV in Lagos and Ogun States, and the other army establishment achieving their own objectives in their domain, I foresee a Nigerian Army that would not only be adequately trained but will have contributed enormously to security in our dear country.</p>
      <p>“We know too well that the Nigerian Army is providing security in virtually all the 36 States of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), we cannot thank you enough for your efforts and sacrifices,” he said.</p>
      <p>Asked what the government was doing to contain gridlock across the state and by extension activities of traffic robbers, Sanwo-Olu said respite was underway, adding that security agents would work round the clock to ensure that criminals do not have their way.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Buratai said the exercise would be conducted simultaneously at 2, 6, 81 and 82 Divisions covering the south and southwest regions.</p>
      <p>Represented by the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 81 Division Maj.-Gen Olu Irefin, Buratai said the exercise was aimed at reassuring all law abiding citizens and the public of the army’s commitment to their security and safety.</p>
      <p>“The exercise will also provide a good opportunity of conducting joint operations with other services and relevant security agencies in order to strengthen inter-agency cooperation for efficient conduct of operations in aid of civil authority.</p>
      <p>“The exercise will be based on the Nigerian Army (NA) Super Camp Concept and will involve civil-military (CIMIC) activities as well as media operations. One of the objectives is to reduce to the nearest minimum, the prevailing security threats in riverine environment such as piracy, illegal oil bunkering activities, pipeline vandalism, cultism, militancy and some other common sundry crimes. “It is also aimed at sharpening the professional skills of the security personnel that are involved in the exercise. The exercise will be intelligence driven and will dovetail into real time operations at any moment a potent threat is encountered.</p>
      <p>“This will be in line with the military constitutional role of conducting internal security operations in aid to civil authority.</p>
      <p>“It is worthy to also mention that the experience gained by the forces during the Simulation Exercise at the AFSC Jaji between October 28 to 30 has immensely contributed towards guiding the troops in their training.” The combat display of our personnel and the collaboration with other security agencies during the Beach Landing operations as well as their enthusiasm and robustness is a clear indication of well-trained troops, prepared to conduct Ex CROCODILE SMILE IV as professional forces.</p>
      <p>“I am very confident that the objectives for the conduct of the exercise will be achieved to further enhance the troops professional knowiedge, capacity in conduct of joint operations and synergy of effort to tackle common perceived security challenges in our dear country, Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“I have no doubt in my mind that Exercise CROCODILE SMILE IV will achieve its mandate of checkmating security challenges in the South South and South West regions respectively. This will again re-energies internal security operations for efficient joint operations. It is also hoped that Nigerians and those resident in the country will celebrate the Christmas and New Year peacefully,” he said.</p>
      <p>At the event were the Oba of Lagos Rilwanu Akiolu, Commandant Nigerian Armed Forces Resettlement Centre (NAFRC) Oshodi Air Vice Marshal Abubakar-Sadick Liman, Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) Western Naval Command (WNC) Rear Admiral Oladele Daji, Commander Nigerian Navy Ship (NNS) BEECROFT Commodore Ibrahim Shettima and other senior military, police, paramilitary officers.</p>
