      <h1>Aldi shopper falsely accused of using fake baby to steal yogurt speaks out</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:33:05+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:33</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Hollan</a></address>
      <p>An amused mother recently shared her side of the story after being bizarrely accused of using a “fake” baby to shoplift at Aldi.</p>
      <p>Another customer apparently thought the New Jersey woman was using a fake baby to steal from the store. Fortunately, no crime was being committed and the infant was just a cute, real-life baby.</p>
      <p>Patricia Larkin recently shared her story on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/LaceyChatter/permalink/2630787800292679/">Lacey Township Chatter Facebook page</a>, where she wrote, “Well, I don't usually do ‘To the person who...’ posts but this one has me cracking up, so here we go: To the lady who told the cashier at Aldi that she thought I had a fake baby and was trying to smuggle yogurts out of the store- 1) My baby is 100% real. 2) Yogurts are like $.25 at Aldi. 3) I'm lactose intolerant and don't consume any dairy at all.”</p>

      <p>Her post concludes, “Thank you for the laugh, though. I really needed it because I was up all night tending to my (again, 100% real) baby.”</p>
      <p>Larkin’s story received mostly positive responses, but it also had a surprising effect.</p>
      <p>A woman claiming to be the customer that complained left a response, explaining, “It was me and I am not ashamed to say so. The baby was sleeping the entire time and was like a dead weight in her arms as well as being wrapped so I could only see the baby’s ear.”</p>

      <p>The commenter continued to explain that she didn’t approach Larkin personally because she didn’t want to put anyone in danger.</p>
      <p>“I decided to err on the side of caution and say something. I did tell the cashier that I really hoped it was a baby. As anyone in retail can tell you, shoplifting involving babies or baby items is quite common," the user wrote. "I am quite glad your baby finally yawned on the check-out line so I knew all was ok. May God bless you with your baby being that quite during your sleeping hours as well.”</p>

      <p>Larkin had a fairly simple response, replying, “She was crying in the carrier and moving around as we walked throughout the store.”</p>
