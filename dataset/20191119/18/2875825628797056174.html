      <p>New mums <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/stacey-solomon">Stacey Solomon</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/mrs-hinch">Mrs Hinch</a> have teamed up on a special project to bring Christmas to children without a home.</p>
      <p>The stars have revealed they've been secretly working together to design special T-shirts and jumpers to raise funds for charity Action For Children.</p>
      <p>It's a cause close to both their hearts.</p>
      <p>Stacey is mum to Zachary, 11, Leighton, seven, and Rex, six months.</p>
      <p>Mrs Hinch, whose real name is Sophie Hinchcliffe, welcomed her first child, a son named Ronnie, in June.</p>
      <p>Sitting with baby Rex, Stacey explained why she's getting involved in a video.</p>
      <p>She said: "Last week, Sophie and me, Mrs Hinch, got to work on a special project together and today we're allowed to announce what it is.</p>

      <p>"We've come together with Action For Children and designed some T-shirts and jumpers, basically to sell and try and raise some money for children who don't have a home or food or feel safe this Christmas."</p>
      <p>Stacey ended by saying she'd be putting pictures of her designs on her <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> page and that she hoped people liked them.</p>
      <p>Mrs Hinch said on her Instagram page: "SO.. As you know me and @staceysolomon worked on something very very special last week and all for an amazing cause!! @actionforchildrenuk</p>

      <p>"Action for Children protects and supports children and young people, providing practical and emotional care and support, ensuring their voices are heard, and campaigning to bring lasting improvements to their lives.</p>
      <p>"Thousands of children will wake up homeless on Christmas Day. Many will experience increased domestic violence and may end up in emergency foster care. For these children, Christmas simply doesn't exist.</p>
      <p>"That is why me and Stacey are Secret Santas and have designed limited edition t-shirts and jumpers for @actionforchildren"</p>
