      <p>Cape Town - Blitzbok speedster <b>Seabelo Senatla</b> is determined to force his way into the Springbok 15-a-side team.</p>
      <p>Senatla has become a superstar on the sevens circuit, scoring 224 tries in 203 matches for the Blitzboks, leaving him fourth overall on the World Rugby Sevens Series <a href="https://www.world.rugby/sevens-series/stats/mens/alltime/players/tries">try-scorers list</a>.</p>
      <p>England's Dan Norton tops the list with 338 tries, followed by Kenya's Collins Injera (271) and Argentina's Santiago Gomez Cora (230).</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old Senatla has tried his hand in 15s rugby in recent seasons, playing on the wing for the Stormers in Super Rugby.</p>
      <p>He hasn't quite reached the same lofty heights in the 15-a-side format, but it hasn't deterred him in reaching his goals.</p>
      <p>"Seabelo is absolutely convinced that he can become a Springbok. That is his focus. He is actually discounting quite a bit in terms of wages to be able to do that. I hope he makes it. He is really keen," Stormers coach <b>John Dobson</b> said during a media briefing at the team's High Performance Centre in Bellville on Monday.</p>
      <p>Senatla, along with Stormers team-mate Ruhan Nel, will play for Blitzboks in the first two World Rugby Sevens events in Dubai (December 5-7) and Cape Town (December 13-15), before committing to the Stormers for Super Rugby.</p>
      <p>Dobson said midfielder Nel could leave later in the season if he cracks the nod for South Africa's Tokyo Olympic team.</p>
      <p>"We've got Angelo Davids, Ruhan and Seabelo. Angelo is staying with the Sevens for the whole season, while Seabelo and Ruhan will join us at our pre-season camp after the Cape Town Sevens. Seabelo will be with us full-time. If he gets selected, Ruhan will go to the Olympics and miss the Super Rugby playoffs," Dobson added.</p>
