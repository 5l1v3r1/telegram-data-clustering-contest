        <b>The mayor of Cascais on Tuesday said that the work to repair the wall of Avenida Marginal begins on Wednesday and will last for between four and five days.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking to Lusa, Carlos Carreiras (Democratic Social Party) explained that on Tuesday morning he was on-site to learn about the situation, saying that the Marginal will undergo two types of intervention, but that the emergency work will begin on Wednesday .</p>
      <p>"The work that will take place immediately, which begins tomorrow, Wednesday, is an emergency work of risk containment, although there are many factors that are not under control, such as the state of the sea and weather conditions. It is a project that will last four to five days, that we estimate will cost about €150,000," he explained.</p>
      <p>The other intervention on Avenida Marginal (Estrada Nacional 6) was already being planned and worked on in a collaboration between the municipality, Infraestruturas de Portugal and the Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente.</p>
      <p>"It is a structural project estimated at €2 million, but still needs a set of procedures. It already has a project, it is going to be put out to tender, then it must be approved by the Court of Auditors. It is a project that will take some more time,” the mayor said.</p>
      <p>The road traffic on the right-hand side of Avenida Marginal heading eastward was closed, between the São Pedro roundabout and Parede crossroads due to the degradation of the wall, the Cascais City Council announced on Monday.</p>
      <p>"The decision is due to the state of degradation of the wall that serves as a containment to National Road 6, along an extension of more than 300 metres," the municipality said in a statement.</p>
