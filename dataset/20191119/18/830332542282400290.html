      <p>(CNN) - Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has launched a new mid-range restaurant chainjust six months after his UK dining empire collapsed.</p>
      <p>Two of his restaurants in Southeast Asia -- one in Bali, the other in Bangkok -- will adopt a new all day dining format. They will be called Jamie Oliver Kitchen and will be partly inspired by local cuisine.</p>
      <p>The Jamie Oliver Group, which operates 70 restaurants in 27 markets, will launch Jamie Oliver Kitchen on November 21 in Bali and on November 28 in Bangkok.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Jamie Oliver said he had acquired many influences from 20 years of traveling around the world, adding that the new restaurants "will bring those inspirations to life."</p>
      <p>The Jamie Oliver Group said in a press release that it plans to open a further 19 restaurants before the end of 2020</p>
      <p>In May, Oliver announced that his UK restaurant empire was placed into administration, or bankruptcy protection. The group included Jamie's Italian chain and steakhouse Barbecoa.</p>
      <p>KPMG, the company acting as administrator,said at the time that 22 of the group's 25 restaurants had closed, leading to the loss of about 1,000 jobs.</p>
      <p>Prior to his UK restaurant chain going into administration, Oliver had pumped millions of pounds into the business in recent years.</p>
      <p>He eventually had to admit defeat in the face of what he described last summer in an interview with the Financial Times as a "perfect storm" of rising rents, wages, food costs, as well as the impact of Brexit and changing shopping habits.</p>
