      <h1>UK weather forecast: Cold warning as temperatures to plunge below freezing again</h1>
      <h2>Public Health England have urged people to look out for the elderly as freezing temperatures are expected again tonight, possibly as low as -3C in parts of Scotland</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:03:54+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:03</time> by <a rel="author">Danya Bazaraa, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/danya-bazaraa/</a></address>
      <p>Health chiefs are urging people to look after those at risk amid the freezing cold <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> with temperatures set to plunge again.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> said the low temperatures will continue until Wednesday, after -9.9C was recorded in Braemar, north-east Scotland, last night.</p>
      <p>Below freezing temperatures are expected again tonight, as cold as -3C in parts of Scotland.</p>
      <p>With warnings that more cold weather is on the way - particularly for the north east, north west and Yorkshire and Humber - Public Health England has a cold weather alert in place until tomorrow.</p>
      <p>This comes as the government issues <a href="https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/warnings">24 flood warnings</a> and 63 flood alerts around the country.</p>

      <p>Dr Emer OConnell, Consultant in Public Health at Public Health England, said: "Older people and those with heart and lung problems are at risk of getting sick in cold weather.</p>
      <p>"Keep an eye out for those who may need help staying warm, ensure they wear lots of thin layers and have everything they need.</p>
      <p>"Below 18 degrees, changes to the body mean that the risk of strokes, heart attacks and chest infections increase so heating homes to this temperature is particularly important to stay well."</p>
