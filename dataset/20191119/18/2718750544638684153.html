      <h1>When Does <i>The Mandalorian</i> Take Place in the <i>Star Wars</i> Universe?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:31:47+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:31</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Tallerico</a></address>
      <p>It can be difficult to keep track of exactly <i>when</i> things happens in a <i>Star Wars</i> story. Since the original <i>Star Wars </i>trilogy, the franchise has jumped back in time for a prequel trilogy, and then forward again for a third trilogy that takes place after <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. Spinoff movies like <i>Rogue One</i> and <i>Solo </i>occupy their own specific spots on the timeline, and don’t even get us started on the <i>Clone Wars</i> animated series. But with the launch of <i>The Mandalorian </i>on Disney+, people have been introduced to a whole new set of characters within the <i>Star Wars</i> galaxy, leading to one major question: When exactly does <i>The Mandalorian</i> take place? Let us guide the way.</p>
      <p>The first thing you need to know: <i>The Mandalorian</i> is not a prequel story about Boba Fett, even though it takes place after Boba falls into a Sarlacc pit in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. The protagonist of this space Western looks a lot like the fan-favorite bounty hunter, but he’s another guy who just happens to be from Mandalor, the home planet of the Mandalorians.</p>
      <p><i>The Mandalorian</i> is set after <i>Return of the Jedi</i> and before<i> The Force Awakens</i>, but there’s a lot of story that hasn’t been told between the Ewok celebration and the rise of the First Order. That timeline has been fleshed out in books like <i>Star Wars: Aftermath, </i>by Chuck Wendig, and <i>Star Wars: Bloodline, </i>by Claudia Gray, but it hadn’t been explored in film or TV until <i>The Mandalorian</i>. How exactly did the galaxy go from a toppled Empire to another corrupt regime of mask-wearing jerks in need of righteous defeat? At this point in the timeline, Darth Vader is dead and Kylo Ren is still just a boy named Ben Solo. Rey and Finn weren’t even born when <i>Jedi</i> took place.</p>
      <p>That’s where we find <i>The Mandalorian</i>. According to series creator and writer <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars-celebration/2019/4/14/18306400/the-mandalorian-star-wars-plot-synopsis-lore-501st-streaming">Jon Favreau</a>, the show takes place five years after <i>Return of the Jedi. </i>That’s enough time for the powerful grip of the Empire to have faded, but a quarter-century before <i>The Force Awakens</i>, so the First Order isn’t all that powerful yet. The <i>Star Wars</i> universe labels its years with BBY and ABY — short for “Before the Battle of Yavin” and “After the Battle of Yavin,” the fancy way to refer to the action of <i>A New Hope</i>. So, <i>Return of the Jedi</i> takes place in 4 ABY, which means that <i>The Mandalorian</i> takes place in the Year of Our Lucas 9 ABY and <i>The Force Awakens</i> begins in 34 ABY.</p>
      <p>Now, you’re probably asking yourself another big question: How does all this affect <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/the-mandalorian-baby-yoda-gifs.html">Baby Yoda</a>? Well, it means the li’l guy isn’t actually Yoda. If he is indeed 50 years old, as suggested in <i>The Mandalorian</i>, Baby Yoda was born when the actual Yoda was still alive.<i> </i>Impress your friends with that trivia!</p>
