      <p>Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) didn't have patience for any attacks on Tuesday's impeachment witnesses Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams, a top foreign policy aide to Vice President Mike Pence.</p>
      <p>Himes asked both witnesses about President Trump describing them as "Never Trumpers." Williams, whom Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/17/politics/donald-trump-attacks-jennifer-williams-never-trumper/index.html">called out</a> over Twitter for trying to orchestrate a "presidential attack," said she would not describe herself as a "Never Trumper," while Vindman said he thinks of himself as "Never Partisan."</p>

      <p>The congressman also offered a harsh rebuttal for Republicans <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879427/republicans-subtly-tried-question-vindmans-loyalty-calmly-shot-down">throwing</a> the Ukrainian-born Vindman's loyalty to the United States into question because he was — perhaps jokingly — offered the position of Ukraine's defense minister by a Ukrainian government official. "It's what you stoop to when the indefensibility of your case requires that you attack a man who is wearing a Springfield rifle on a field of blue above a Purple Heart," Himes said. Tim O'Donnell</p>
