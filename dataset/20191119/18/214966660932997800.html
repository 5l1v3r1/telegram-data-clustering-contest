      <h1>DONE DEAL | Federal government commits extra funds for tram extension to Burleigh </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:54:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.mygc.com.au/author/rdakin/" target="_blank">Rebecca Dakin</a></address>
      <p>THE Morrison Government has confirmed it will commit the extra funding needed to get Stage 3A of the Gold Coast light rail off the ground.</p>
      <p>Canberra will be coughing up the $157 million needed to deliver the extension from Broadbeach to Burleigh, taking the government’s total commitment for the project to $269 million.</p>
      <p>$62 million of the funding will also be brought forward, meaning construction can get underway in early 2020. It’s expected to take around two years to complete.</p>
      <p>The federal government has also confirmed it will bring forward $45 million in funding for the Pacific Motorway upgrade from Varsity Lakes to Tugun, which is expected to flow through in the next financial year.</p>
      <p>Minister for Industry, Science and Technology and Member for McPherson, Karen Andrews, said it is a massive deal for the Gold Coast.</p>
      <p>“This funding will deliver more than just the infrastructure itself. It will be an important shot in the arm for the Gold Coast economy and will create hundreds of jobs in the construction phase,” Ms Andrews said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a real vote of confidence in our city which will have tremendous flow on effects for business in a time when we need it.”</p>
      <p>The funding deal for the Gold Coast forms part of a near $2 billion infrastructure spend across Queensland, which will include $400 million in new road funding and an agreement on Inland Rail linking freight from Melbourne to Brisbane.</p>
      <p>Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has hailed the cash injection as a huge win for Queensland.</p>
      <p>“I have always said we work best when we work together and this proves it,” Ms Palaszczuk said.</p>
      <p>“We have called for a better deal for Queensland and the Prime Minister has listened.</p>
      <p>“This deal will allow us to start work more quickly on the congestion busting road and rail projects our growing state needs.”</p>
      <p>Queensland Transport and Main Roads Minister Mark Bailey also praised the announcement.</p>
      <p>“This is a massive win,” Minister Bailey said.</p>
      <p>“Inland Rail presents an opportunity to move more freight onto trains and take trucks off roads.</p>
      <p>“That becomes more important as south east Queensland continues to grow.</p>
      <p>“It delivers funding for what’s needed now, like the next stage of light rail on the Gold Coast, and what will be needed in the coming decade.”</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected on the Gold Coast on Wednesday to formally announce the agreement.</p>
