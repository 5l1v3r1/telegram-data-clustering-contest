      </figure>
      <p>Each iconic Disney quote is written on the stuffed plush released. January’s quote is a line Dumbo’s friend Timothy Q. Mouse says to the young elephant, “The very things that held you down are going to lift you up, and up, and up.”</p>
      <p>Disney told Insider the inspiration for the quotes came from guest responses to the first release in the Mickey Mouse Memories collection. A Walt Disney quote <a href="https://www.mindzai.com/products/disney-mickey-mouse-memories-plush-january-2018-limited-edition">appeared on the mouse’s foot</a> reading, “I only hope that we never lose site of one thing – that it was all started by a Mouse.”</p>
