      <p>KANDAHAR: The Taliban handed two Western hostages over to US forces in southern Afghanistan on Tuesday (Nov 19), three years after they were abducted, in a swap for three high-ranking insurgent prisoners that could boost peace talks.</p>
      <p>The exchange of American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks for the militants - including Anas Haqqani, brother to the Taliban's deputy leader - was welcomed by both the United States and the insurgents.</p>

      <p>US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the releases "give us hope for the success of intra-Afghan peace negotiations, which the United States stands ready to support."</p>
      <p>King and Weeks, both professors at the American University in Kabul, were kidnapped by gunmen wearing military uniforms in the heart of Afghan capital in August 2016.</p>
      <p>They later appeared looking haggard in a Taliban hostage video, with the insurgents going on to say that King was in poor health.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday morning, they were driven by car to Nawbahar district in Zabul, a southern province bordering Pakistan, an insurgent source told AFP.</p>
      <p>They were freed at around 10.00am and flown out of Zabul on American helicopters, according to a local police source.</p>
      <p>The insurgents were released in Doha, where the Taliban maintain a political office, a tweet from their spokesman in the Qatari capital Suhail Shaheen confirmed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'A STEP FORWARD'</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Taliban's main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said the transfer of the Taliban prisoners was "complete, and they have arrived where they were supposed to come".</p>
      <p>The swap could herald a breakthrough in stalled efforts to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table with the Kabul government and begin work towards a political settlement ending their 18-year insurgency.</p>
      <p>Mujahid described the exchange as "a step forward in good-will and confidence-building measures that can aid the peace process".</p>
      <p>The US welcomed the exchange and revealed the two hostages had suffered "significant hardship".</p>
      <p>"We pray for the full recovery of both men," said White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham.</p>
      <p>"We thank the Afghan government for its actions, in the spirit of our partnership that enabled the freeing of the hostages."</p>
      <p>When Afghan President Ashraf Ghani first announced the potential exchange on November 12, he said that Kabul had ensured the militants would not return to the front line.</p>
      <p>And he said he hoped the swap would "pave the way" for unofficial direct talks between his government and the Taliban, who have long refused to negotiate with Kabul.</p>
      <p>Anas Haqqani, whose older brother Sirajuddin is the deputy Taliban leader and head of the Haqqani network, one of the militant group's deadliest factions, was seized in 2014.</p>
      <p>Afghan authorities accuse Anas of being a high-level player in the network. The Taliban has long demanded his release, insisting he was a student.</p>
      <p>The other two freed Taliban were Haji Mali Khan, believed to be the uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani, and Abdul Rashid, said to be the brother of Mohammad Nabi Omari, a member of the Taliban's political office in Qatar.</p>
      <p>Mujahid said the Taliban had also released 10 Afghan soldiers along with the Western hostages.</p>
      <p>
        <b>AUSTRALIAN RELIEF</b>
      </p>
      <p>"We are profoundly pleased and relieved," Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement, adding that Weeks' family had asked the government to convey their relief and gratitude.</p>
      <p>Since September 2018 Washington and the Taliban had been holding direct talks, seeking an agreement for US troops to begin leaving Afghanistan and the militants start negotiations with Kabul.</p>
      <p>They were on the verge of a deal when US President Donald Trump scuttled the talks in September, citing Taliban violence.</p>
      <p>Most observers agree that a political pact is the only way towards lasting peace in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>"We see these developments as hopeful signs that the Afghan war, a terrible and costly conflict that has lasted 40 years, may soon conclude through a political settlement," Pompeo said.</p>
      <p>Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, whose government had helped facilitate the talks between the insurgents and Washington, also said he hoped the release would give a "boost of confidence" to all sides to re-engage.</p>
