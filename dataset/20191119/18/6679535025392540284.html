      <h1>‘Amma Vodi’ will bring mothers closer to books, says Padma</h1>
      <h2>‘Their role in initiating children into education immense’</h2>

      <p>Mothers share a unique bond with books, which they extend to their babies by reading them stories and storytelling. A mother, thus, plays a very important role in initiating the child into education.</p>
      <p>“The State-sponsored Amma Vodi programme is aimed at strengthening the bond between mothers and education,” said Andhra Pradesh Women’s Commission Chairperson Vasireddy Padma here on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Addressing a meeting on ‘Mother’s role in getting children interested in books’, jointly organised by the Krishna Zilla Grandhalaya Samstha and the Montessori Educational Institutions in connection with the 52nd National Library Week at the Tagore Memorial Library, Ms. Padma elaborated how a mother creates interest in the child towards education in a way that books become an intrinsic part of their life.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the passing time, books would never lose their charm, she said. “Books are a guiding force to the mankind just the way parents are to their children,” she observed. She said people without books (education) were both literally and figuratively poor.</p>
      <p>Referring to Amma Vodi, a scheme designed by the government to reward mothers who send their children to government schools with cash incentives, Ms. Padma asserted that it would actually strengthen the bond between the mothers and books, which in turn, would extend to the young learners.</p>
      <h3>‘Develop libraries’</h3>
      <p>She said a rich culture could be developed by inculcating book-reading habit among people.</p>
      <p>Recalling that the former Chief Minister, Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, had allocated adequate funds to develop the Tagore Memorial Library with modern facilities, she said there was a need to shift focus to development of libraries as they were knowledge troves that could be of great help in enriching the future generations.</p>
      <p>Ms. Padma expressed concern over how young children were under the negative effects of the Internet and cell phones, which had been taking them away from books.</p>
      <p>“Unlike the unwanted staff on the Internet and cell phones, books not only enhance knowledge but also infuse self-confidence,” she said.</p>
      <p>Krishna district Joint Collector K. Madhavilatha, former Director, AIR, Vijayawada, M. Krishna Kumari, president of Montessori Institutions A. Sasibala, and Andhra Pradesh Grandhalaya Samstha general secretary Raavi Sarada were present.</p>
