      <p><b>NYON, Switzerland — </b>The 16-team lineup for the 2020 European Championship playoffs was confirmed Tuesday with a draw needed this week to decide which three nations join Iceland in the top-tier bracket.</p>
      <p>The 16 teams will be divided into four brackets based on their placement in last year’s Nations League, with the winner in each advancing to next year’s tournament.</p>
      <p>Single-game semifinals in each bracket will be played on March 26, with the four finals played five days later.</p>
      <p>A UEFA draw on Friday will decide home advantage in the four playoff finals.</p>
      <p>The final qualifying group games on Tuesday settled the second-tier League B playoffs: Bosnia-Herzegovina will host Northern Ireland, and Slovakia will host Ireland.</p>
      <p>Iceland was the only team ranked high enough for the League A bracket that didn’t qualify directly for the tournament, meaning three teams that would otherwise have been in League C will be placed in that pot instead.</p>
      <p>Those three will be taken from the quartet of Bulgaria, Hungary, Israel and Romania.</p>
      <p>The fourth team among those will face Scotland in League C, which also includes Norway and Serbia.</p>
      <p>Scotland, Romania and Hungary are among the 12 host countries for the 24-team tournament. Their reward for advancing would be at least two home games in the Euro 2020 group stage.</p>
      <p>League D includes Georgia, Belarus, North Macedonia and Kosovo, four teams that have never reached a major tournament before.</p>
      <p>Euro 2020 groups are drawn Nov. 30 in Bucharest, Romania, four months before the playoffs.</p>
      <p>League A: Iceland vs. Bulgaria or Hungary or Israel or Romania, Bulgaria or Hungary or Israel or Romania vs Bulgaria or Hungary or Israel or Romania</p>
      <p>League B: Bosnia-Herzegovina vs. Northern Ireland, Slovakia vs Ireland.</p>
      <p>League C: Scotland vs. Bulgaria or Hungary or Israel or Romania, Norway vs. Serbia.</p>
      <p>League D: Georgia vs. Belarus, North Macedonia vs. Kosovo.</p>
