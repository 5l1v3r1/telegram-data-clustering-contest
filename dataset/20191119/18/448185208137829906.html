      <p><b>Gaza</b><b>:</b> Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas chief, said that the battle with Israel is “not over” although the new wave of violence in the Gaza Strip is over. Haniyeh made the remarks on Sunday after he gave his condolences to the Abu Malhous family which lost eight of its members in the last round of violence between Israel and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Xinhua news agency reported. “Our victory in the previous round is not counted by the number of the fired rockets, nor by the losses sustained, but by the fact that resistance has completely paralyzed the entity (Israel) during the escalation,” he told reporters.
