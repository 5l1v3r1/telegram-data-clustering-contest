      <h1>No serious injuries after wheels fly off UPS truck, hit convertible on Hwy. 407 in Markham</h1>

      <p>No serious injuries were reported after a set of dual wheels came flying off of a UPS truck and struck two vehicles on Highway 407 in Markham.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred in the eastbound lanes of the highway near Leslie Street at around 11 a.m.</p>
      <p>OPP Sgt. Kerry Schmidt said the wheels separated from the truck and went bouncing down the highway toward oncoming traffic.</p>
      <p>“Those wheels they bounced across the 407 eastbound lanes and ended up way off in the distance, striking a westbound… convertible. That vehicle ended up going into the ditch (and) rolling over several times,” Schmidt said. “Amazingly the driver was not injured.”</p>
      <p>Schmidt said the wheels struck another vehicle, which sustained only minor damage as a result of the collision.</p>
      <p>“Fortunately no one was seriously injured or killed but we certainly have seen that in the past,” Schmidt said.</p>
      <p>“Obviously (it was) a pretty scary experience for the driver, even scarier for the vehicle going the opposite direction as they see a set of wheels come bouncing toward them.”</p>
      <p>He said once the highway is cleaned up, officials will be looking into why the wheels came off.</p>
      <p>Schmidt said the tires and rims had been removed two weeks ago so the rubber could be replaced.</p>
      <p>“This is the time of year where we typically see an increase of wheel separations because people are installing their winter tires,” Schmidt said.</p>
