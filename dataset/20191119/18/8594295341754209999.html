      <p>Just when you thought the gas war couldn’t get any wilder, California has announced it will ban the purchase of any vehicle manufactured by a company that doesn’t explicitly recognize the state’s ability to set its own emission regulations.</p>
      <p>Starting in January, California plans to purchase any-and-all government fleet vehicles from only Ford, Honda, BMW, and Volkswagen Group — <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/07/four-automakers-make-a-deal-with-california-regarding-vehicle-emissions/">companies that backed a voluntary agreement</a> to adhere to the state’s emission rules over the summer. The pact is now the subject of <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/09/gas-war-antitrust-probe-opened-into-automakers-endorsing-california-emissions-pact/">a federal antitrust probe</a>.</p>
      <p>Any automaker publicly supporting a single national standard (or having recently expressed support for the Trump administration’s fuel rollback proposal) will be deemed ineligible for fleet consideration. “Car makers that have chosen to be on the wrong side of history will be on the losing end of California’s buying power,” California Governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement.</p>
      <p>California also said it would no longer allow state agencies to purchase sedans <a href="https://calmatters.org/environment/2019/11/california-says-it-wont-buy-cars-from-gm-toyota-others-opposing-tough-fuel-standards/">powered by internal combustion engines</a>, effective immediately. Minor exceptions would be made for some safety vehicles, but the rest will be electrified (or at least hybridized).</p>
      <p>Unless you count the handful of BMW i3s Los Angeles purchased for its police department (<a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2018/01/lapd-green-fleet/">which reportedly sit idle</a>) and a bevy of BMW police motorcycles, California doesn’t have much of a history with European products. <a href="https://www.autonews.com/regulation-safety/california-stop-buying-gm-toyota-and-fca-vehicles-over-emissions-fight"><i>Automotive News</i></a> reports that the state purchased $69.2 million in vehicles from Ford and $565,000 from Honda in the three years leading up to 2019.</p>
      <p>From <i>Automotive News</i>:</p>
      <blockquote>Between 2016 and 2018, California purchased $58.6 million in vehicles from General Motors, $55.8 million from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles $10.6 million from Toyota Motor Corp. and $9 million from Nissan Motor Co .<br/><br/>Last month, GM, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler and members of the Global Automakers trade association backed the Trump administration’s effort to bar California from setting tailpipe standards, which are more rigid than Washington’s proposed national standards.<br/><br/>The automakers declined or did not immediately comment on California’s announced ban on purchases of their vehicles.</blockquote>
      <p>They’re likely waiting to see what the final rollback proposal looks like, but we’ve all been waiting while California continues amassing strength. Several lawsuits have emerged against the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, aimed at maintaining California’s regulatory sovereignty, and the state has allied itself with 13 others that have each agreed to its tailpipe emissions.</p>
