      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/frank-lampard">Frank Lampard</a> got off to a bad start as <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/chelsea">Chelsea</a> manager but he has since steadied the ship and things are now looking great for the Blues.</p>
      <p>Lampard has done what many believed to be impossible at the club, promoting the youth while also playing some amazing football.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/fabio-capello">Fabio Capello</a> has now backed the young manager to become the England boss one day. The former Juventus and England manager was talking to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/amp/football/news/11668/11864723/frank-lampard-to-manage-england-one-day-according-to-fabio-capello">Sky Sports</a> when he said:</p>
      <blockquote>"I don't know [if he'll beome England manager]. [But] Probably...because he can do it. He understands everything and has started without fear and put young players on the pitch."</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“I follow him. I watch all the games and I was upset when he started the season and he lost two games and the team didn't play well. Now, the results are good and the position is really good and without the [transfer] market.”</blockquote>
      <p>Chelsea face a tough test this weekend in the Premier League when they take on Manchester City. The current champions are a point behind the Blues in the table but that is not a true reflection of the side's qualities.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's men will be keen on a repeat of last season's result when they ran out 6-0 winners against Chelsea.</p>
