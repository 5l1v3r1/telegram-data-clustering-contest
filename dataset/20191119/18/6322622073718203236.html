      <p>GEORGE TOWN (Nov 19): UK-based global medical equipment manufacturer Smith+Nephew (S+N) will build its new manufacturing facility in the Batu Kawan Industrial Park.</p>
      <p>Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow said the plant, which is S+N’s first manufacturing facility in Southeast Asia, is expected to create up to 800 jobs over the next five years.</p>
      <p>“The new facility will initially span 23,225.76 square metre, with the opportunity to expand in the future if required. Construction is expected to begin in early 2020, with the first production batches shipped by the end of 2022,” he told a press conference, here today.</p>
      <p>S+N vice-president Ross Macken, who was also present at the press conference, said the company had considered various places for its facility before choosing Penang, due to its strategic location.</p>
      <p>He said Penang has a lot of highly-skilled and motivated workforce, as well as a great balance in manufacturing expertise.</p>
      <p>“Malaysia overall is very attractive to us. It has a stable economy, established infrastructure, a long history of foreign direct investment — all things we value highly,” he said.</p>
      <p>Macken said the first phase of the new facility would focus on the production of implants for orthopaedic surgeries such as hip and knee implants.</p>
      <p>“As time moves on, we would also be bringing in other manufacturing of products for sports medicine and wound management as the facility continues to expand,” he added.</p>
      <p>Set up in 1856 and currently headquartered in Watford, the UK, S+N has presence in more than 100 countries with a recorded revenue of US$4.9 billion (RM20.38 billion) and research &amp; development expenses of US$246 million (RM1.02 billion) in 2018.</p>
