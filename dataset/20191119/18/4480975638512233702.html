      <p>While recognizing that the Bank of Canada's (BoC) policy rate was low at 1.75%, "there is still room to maneuver," BoC's Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins told a business audience in Montreal on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"The global context has worsened, increasing the risk to global expansion and chances of financial stress that could spill over into Canada," Wilkins added. "In the unlikely event of a storm, Canada's financial system is resilient and we are in a good position to deal with whatever comes our way." </p>
      <p>The USD/CAD pair edged higher on these comments and was last seen trading at 1.3258, adding 0.4% on a daily basis.</p>
