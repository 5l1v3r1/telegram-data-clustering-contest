      <h1>UK girl, 7, writes heartbreaking letter to Santa, prompts pledges of donations after going viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:15:15+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:15</time> by <a rel="author">Barnini Chakraborty</a></address>
      <p>A 7-year-old girl from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom">England</a> sent a heartbreaking handwritten letter to Santa asking for a home and food for her family this <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/special/occasions/holiday">Christmas</a>.</p>
      <p>The child, whose name has not been made public, dropped the letter in a special Santa mailbox inside the <a href="https://liverpool6community.wixsite.com/website">L6 Community Center in Liverpool</a>. The Santa box was left out for children who visit the center to write their Christmas wishes.</p>
      <p>The letter starts off, "Dear Father Christmas, Can you help? Can we have a home for Christmas? Mam wants us to be all together. Can you give us some food and can I have just a nice doll for Christmas?"</p>

      <p>The sweet but sad wish prompted Labour councilor Gerald Woodhouse to tweet a picture of the girl's note.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "Last week @L6Centre we started getting down Xmas decorations we placed The Santa post box in the cafe until grotto is set up. Today, I went into @L6Centre to sort food parcels for residents while passing post box I looked in it!! Just read a 7 yrs old letter Vote Labour."</p>

      <p>"It was so upsetting to read," Woodhouse told <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/child-asks-santa-for-food-and-a-home-in-heartbreaking-christmas-letter-11864725">Sky News</a>. "I know the children, and it's not right that a 7-year-old child is worrying about Christmas in November. There is no one around to support these children."</p>
      <p>According to the report, the children current live with a relative. Woodhouse said the community center is trying to help the family and get them in a hotel for Christmas Day.</p>
