      <h1>‘Lies and cover-ups’: Sars rogue unit report to be challenged</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:22:20+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:22</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>Former South African Revenue Services executive Johann van Loggerenberg says he will challenge the inspector-general of intelligence report related to the service’s so-called rogue unit.</p>
      <p>He called the report “a concoction of lies, disinformation, fraudulent claims and a complete cover-up of evidence and facts that implicate people associated with the State Security Agency, its Special Operations Unit and other branches”.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the Public Protector announced that she received the redacted report, which found that the unit was unlawful, from State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo.</p>
      <p>Van Loggerenberg said the 2014 report was supposed to look into serious allegations against people associated with the State Security Agency, its Special Operations Unit and other branches.</p>
      <p>“The inspector-general of intelligence at the time clearly failed to do so. The current inspector-general of intelligence has recently confirmed that these are now being considered,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said he had read the redacted report since its release to the Public Protector and other parties.</p>
      <p>Besides calling it “a concoction of lies, disinformation, fraudulent claims and a complete cover-up of evidence and facts that implicate people associated with the State Security Agency, its Special Operations Unit and other branches, as well as other state intelligence operatives and private entities and persons associated with the ‘Services’”, Van Loggerenberg also said it purported to express findings and recommendations that were mala fide (in bad faith) and ultra vires (beyond one’s legal power or authority).</p>
      <p>“To the extent that I was aware of the content of the report in September 2019, I deposed to an affidavit (complete with evidentiary substantiation), dispelling the content. None of the parties involved in the litigation attempted to refute or challenge my evidence. In fact, all opposing parties accepted my evidence and even sought to rely on parts thereof during argument.,” he said.</p>
      <p>Van Loggerenberg said he would be challenging the report in court in due course to seek to have it reviewed and set aside.</p>
      <p>“During this process I shall demonstrate these lies and cover-ups,” he said.</p>
