      <p>A 41-year-old man who allegedly bumped and killed a cyclist in a hit and run incident on the Western Bypass on Friday was denied bail when he made his first court appearance on Tuesday.<br/>Paulus Kambata was arraigned on charges of culpable homicide, fleeing an accident scene, failing to report an accident to the police, failing to render assistance to an injured person, reckless and negligent driving, failing to stop and defeating the course of justice in the death of a 38-year-old cyclist, Ingrid Scholtz.<br/>Kambata appeared before magistrate Linus Samuzala Samuzala in the Windhoek Magistrateâ€™s Court and his case was postponed to 20 February 2020 for further police investigations.<br/>Senior public prosecutor Rowan van Wyk strongly objected to the granting of bail on the grounds that Kambata faces serious charges, that he might interfere with police investigations and that it is not in the public interest and the course of justice to grant the accused bail.<br/>It was first believed that Scholtz was struck by a minibus taxi, but the Namibian Police later revealed that she was hit by a black Mercedes Benz allegedly driven by Kambata on the Western Bypass near the University of Namibia around 19h00.<br/>The victim was declared dead at the Lady Pohamba Private Hospital where she was taken to after the incident.<br/>Kambata was arrested at his residence in Wanaheda on Monday.<br/>He said during his court appearance that he would engage a private lawyer and apologise to the family of the deceased.<br/>The accused remains in custody.<br/>-NAMPA</p>
