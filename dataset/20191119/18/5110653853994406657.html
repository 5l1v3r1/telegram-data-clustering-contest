      <h1>DraftKings Week 12 Thursday Night Showdown: Picks, advice for Texans vs. Colts NFL DFS</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:08:09+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:08</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>Texans vs. Colts on Thursday Night Football gives us a prime-time opportunity to appreciate Deshaun Watson. The Colts will have an interesting test at putting together a competent roster around Jacoby Brissett because the injury bug has bit them left and right. That gives a great opportunity for value in DraftKings Showdown contestsbecause NFL DFS players love to find cheaply priced injury replacements.</p>
      <p>With this lineup construction, the only thing we're missing total involvement in is the Houston running game, but I feel just fine not playing Carlos Hyde or Duke Johnson Jr. If this game turns into a passing-game shootout, we should score well.</p>

      <h3>DraftKings Showdown Picks: Texans vs. Colts</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Captain (1.5x price, 1.5x points): RB Jonathan Williams, Colts ($8,400)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Assuming Marlon Mack (hand)and Jordan Wilkins (ankle) are officially out, Williams becomes a huge value as a starting running back behind a good offensive line. He ran for 116 yards in relief of Mack last week, and another 100-yard game is within reach here.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FLEX: QB Deshaun Watson, Texans ($11,600)</b>
      </p>
      <p>I find it nearly impossible to ever fade the stud quarterback in one of these prime-time slates. The Colts' defense isn't good enough to give me any pause about playing Watson.<b> </b></p>
      <p>
        <b>FLEX: WR DeAndre Hopkins, Texans ($11,000)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Will Fuller's health isn't a certainty, and even if he plays through a hamstring injury, it's not obvious whether he'll get a full allotment of snaps. We might as well just play the top wideout Houston has in a guaranteed heavy volume spot.</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>FLEX: QB Jacoby Brissett, Colts ($10,400)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brissett hasn't been as good as he was early in the season, but we're trying to lock down touchdowns in this game and Houston can be thrown against no matter which Indianapolis receivers are healthy enough to take the field.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FLEX: WR Marcus Johnson, Colts ($4,200)</b>
      </p>
      <p>This pick assumes T.Y. Hilton (calf) will be out (and is helped if Devin Funchess remains out, too). Johnson has been the No. 2 outside WR for Indy in recent weeks, and he caught all four of his targets last week. We don't really know if he has a ton of upside, but the floor is usable at this price.<b> </b></p>
      <p>
        <b>FLEX: TE Darren Fells, Texans ($3,400)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fells has been a touchdown machine this season, and it's odd that he's priced below both Eric Ebron and Jack Doyle. It's a great way to stack the Houston passing attack and avoid the secondary receiver mess that there could be for the Texans.</p>
