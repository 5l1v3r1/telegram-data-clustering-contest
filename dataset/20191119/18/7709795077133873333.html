      <p>With booked jockey Trevor Whelan unable to get to the Surrey course because his flight was cancelled, owner Vaughan Lewis took to Twitter in the hope of finding a replacement in time.</p>
      <p>Kneller came to the rescue by dashing to Lingfield and taking the ride on the Zoe Davison-trained 10-year-old.</p>

      <p>And it was well worth it, as she <b><a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/results/2019-11-19/lingfield/552427/flat-jockeys-can-jump-handicap-hurdle">landed her first success of 2019</a></b> after 35 winless rides on the Flat.</p>
      <p>Ruacana was carrying a 7lb penalty for winning at the track a week ago - but it proved no burden.</p>
      <p>Kneller had Ruacana close to the pace set by Flaminger before leading from the third-last flight and, though that rival tried to rally, the 13/8 favourite kept on strongly to win by 10 lengths.</p>
      <p>"That was great fun. He jumped well. He was a schoolmaster - he met everything perfect and I was just a passenger. He was an absolute superstar," Kneller told Sky Sports Racing.</p>
      <p>"I said I ought to go jumping - I had a McDonald's on the way here and these weights are much better!"</p>

      <p>Lewis said: "She should probably take out a jumps' licence. She gave him a peach of a ride, brilliant stuff.</p>
      <p>"He only ran last week. He looked in good form and this ground is ideal for him. Two miles is probably a bit short, but he showed his class today.</p>
      <p>"It's fantastic for the stable. They've done an unbelievable job with him. It's great for Zoe and the team, brilliant for them."</p>
