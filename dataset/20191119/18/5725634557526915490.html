      <h1>Big 5 Still Has A Big Balance Sheet Issue</h1>

      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Big 5's stock price has recovered somewhat over the past several months.</li>
        <li>Investors are thrilled with same store sales "growth"</li>
        <li>Free cash flow YTD amounts of less than 1% of sales.</li>
        <li>Big 5 is undifferentiated, faces structural labor issues, and possess a terrible balance sheet.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BGFV">BGFV</a>) rallied dramatically on the company’s surprise profit and better than expected same-store sales growth. Although shares have receded somewhat off their 28% rally, the stock trades more than 10% higher than it did prior to Q3 earnings. Overall, while I concede that Q3 was better than I had predicted, the company’s fundamentals remain challenged. Let’s take a look at Q3 results, and why Big 5’s balance sheet does not support a long position.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>Q3: Positive Same Store Sales But the Trend is Terrible</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Q3 same store sales were up 0.3% y/y, which on the surface, seems like a positive development, even though total sales growth was about flat versus the comparable period. However, this same-store sales growth 1) comes with a smaller store base with several weak stores shuttered and, 2) compares to a 2.9% drop in Q3’17 and a 2% drop in Q3’18. In short, the three-year stacked comp sits at -4.6%, demonstrating the continued downward trend within the business.</p>
      <p>Although positive sales momentum certainly underpins the market’s positive reaction, I think investors were also impressed by the company’s 130 basis point increase in gross margin. Big 5 registered a 32.3% gross margin, driven by a 94 basis point increase in merchandise margin, which resulted in the company’s best merchandise margin since it went public in 2002. Management was relatively open with the drivers, which were primarily a shift away from lower margin guns and ammunition and increased sales from “opportunistic buys.” It sounds like Big 5 is mimicking TJX (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TJX">TJX</a>) and Ross (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROST">ROST</a>), potentially letting availability drive merchandising strategy rather than letting merchandising strategy drive product availability. We will see how sustainable this dynamic is over time.</p>
      <p>SG&amp;A declined by about 30 basis points y/y to 28.9% of sales on a decline of $800 thousand in spending, likely mostly related to advertising as it was in prior quarters in 2019.</p>
      <p>Overall, operating margin nearly doubled to 3.4% of sales. We will see how sustainable this number is over time, but during Q3, it resulted in $0.30 per share of earnings, an increase of 100%.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>Balance Sheet and Cash Flow are the Prevailing Issues</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Although Big 5 posted significant earnings improvement, the company’s balance sheet and cash flow remain an issue. At the end of Q3, Big 5’s cash balance sits at only $5 million versus $60.6 million in long-term debt. This figure is about 27% lower than it was in the year ago period, but it remains high for a company unable to generate consistent earnings power.</p>
      <p>Free cash flow in FY19 has been positive YTD at roughly $7.4 million. For context, this comes off of a sales base of $752 million, and it equates to less than 1% of sales. Even if earnings are at the high end of management’s guidance of $0.04 to $0.16 per share, I don’t see the company generating more than $10-12 million in free cash flow.</p>
      <p>The company continues to teeter on breakeven, and unless Big 5’s same store sales jump for the next several quarters, I do not see the company able to sustain itself in the event of a downturn.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>Don’t Buy the Rally</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Big 5 continues to screen cheaply on virtually any screen, and I see why the company looks attractive based on traditional value metrics. However, I do not believe the current level of free cash flow is sustainable, and any downturn will likely wipe out all equity holders.</p>
      <p>As I have noted in the past, Big 5’s labor cost structure looks unattractive going forward, and I do not believe there is much room for an undifferentiated, retailer with no e-commerce presence and virtually no reason to exist. I continue to believe Big 5 sits in a precarious position, and though I cannot advocate shorting such a small stock, I do not believe investors will make money owning Big 5 over the long run.</p>
