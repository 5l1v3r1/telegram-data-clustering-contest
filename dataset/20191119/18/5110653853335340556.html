      <h1>NHL 2019-20: Leon Draisaitl, David Pastrnak and 10 things we've learned so far this season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:54:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:54</time> by <a rel="author">Jace Mallory</a></address>
      <p>Here we are, aquarter of the way through the 2019-20 NHL season — andwhat a start it has been.</p>
      <p>While it's still early, we are far enough into the season now to take a look at where everything stands. Sure, no team has clinched orbeen eliminated from postseason play —none of us needs a reminder ofhow things looked for the eventual Stanley Cup Champion St. Louis Blues at this time last year — but frontrunners could already be emerging.</p>
      <p>Regardless, as far as statistics go, 2019-20 looks to be a doozy with a plethora of records hanging in the balance should the following 75 percent of the season follow the first 25 percent's pursuit. From teams to individuals, it has been quite exciting through 317 games.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Here are 10 things we have learned one-fourth of the way down the stretch, by the numbers.</p>
      <h3>1,956 goals scored</h3>
      <p>In the previous 23 years, only once has an NHL season seen more goals at this mark with 2,007 in 2005-06. It also marks the second-highest goals-per-game rate of 6.2 behind the 6.3 rate of the previously mentioned season.</p>
      <p>This season has also seen 1,462 goals scored at even strength in regulation or overtime which isthe most through one-fourth of a seasonin 27 years (1,529 in 1992-93).</p>
      <h3>160 points that Leon Draisaitl is on pace to reach</h3>
      <p>Leon Draisaitl's 43 points (16 goals, 27 assists) through 22 gameshas him producing at a rate of 1.95 points per game, putting him on pace to reach 160 on the season. OnlyWayne Gretzky (9 times) and Mario Lemieux (4 times) have hit thatmark.</p>
      <p>Draisaitl's 43 points are the mostat this stage since Mario Lemieux in 1995-96,who had 53 pointsin three fewer games — and was also the last to hit the 160-point plateau.</p>

      <h3>140 comeback wins</h3>
      <p>Forty-four percent of games have ended incomeback fashion this season. There have been 66 third-period comeback victories, marking the most ever at this stage of a season. As far as multi-goal comeback wins are concerned,this season's45 is thesecond-most in NHL history,behind last season's 48.</p>
      <h3>87 overtime games</h3>
      <p>There have never been more overtime games through the first quarter of a season in NHL history but with the thrill of 3-on-3 hockey, who is complaining?</p>

      <h3>76 — NHL record for points in a season by a rookie defenseman</h3>
      <p>In 1980-81,Los Angeles Kings'Larry Murphy set the NHL record for points by a rookie defensemanwith 76.Now,Colorado’s Cale Makar (5-17—22 in 20 GP) is on pace for 90 points in 2019-20, which would break the currentrecord by 14.</p>
      <p>With his performance, Makar seems like the obvious frontrunner for the Calder, and at this point, it's his to lose.</p>
      <h3>40 challenges this season</h3>
      <p>With the changes made to NHL failed challengeconsequences this offseason, teams have been more hesitant to issue them this go-round, seeingthe total number of challenges down 32 percent from2018-19. However, the 58 percent success rate far surpasseslast year's 32 percent.</p>
