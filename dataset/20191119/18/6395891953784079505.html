      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - A probationary Providence police officer has pleaded not guilty to simple domestic assault.</p>
      <p>WJAR-TV reports that 28-year-old Craig Amado entered the plea Tuesday and was released on personal recognizance. The judge ordered Amado to have no contact with his girlfriend.</p>
      <p>Amado's attorney did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Providence police spokeswoman Lindsay Lague says Amado was arrested Thursday and the charge stems from an incident that morning involving his 21-year-old girlfriend, the mother of his 6-month-old baby.</p>
      <p>The police report says Amado and his girlfriend allegedly argued because she took his car without his permission, then got into a physical altercation.</p>
      <p>The police department says Amado has been an officer since June and was suspended with pay pending an internal investigation.</p>
