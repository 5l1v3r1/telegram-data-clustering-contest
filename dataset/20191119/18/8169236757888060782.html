      <p>Obviously there’s the age factor to consider and the fact that they probably don’t have the legs to get around the pitch anymore, but it would be intriguing to see them play in a competitive match.</p>

      <p>That can surely only help the development of his young players with the likes of Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori all getting chances to shine this season.</p>
