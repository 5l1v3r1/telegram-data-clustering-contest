      <p>Amazon has the Roku Express <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">on sale</a> for as low as $25 right now, making it cheap and easy to stream Disney+. Not a huge price discount from its regular price of $28, but it does match an all-time low and its projected Black Friday price.</p>
      <p>With the Roku Express, you're going to be able to stream Disney+ (and much more) on your TV. Seeing Disney+ is available on Roku. So if you we're looking for a dongle or a set-top box that you could pick up to watch Disney+ on the big screen, this is a great one to get.</p>
      <p>Now with the Roku Express, you're not getting 4K content. It's unfortunate, but not surprising. Given the price and size of the Roku Express. It's pretty small, and to support 4K, it's going to need more processing power. And therefore more space. Roku Express will stream in up to 720p resolution. That's going to make it great for a secondary TV that might be in a bedroom or a guest room. And also great for watching regular TV, since there is still a lot of content that is shot in 720p.</p>

      <p>Roku runs all of the latest apps, and has over half a million movies and TV shows available. Including YouTube, YouTube TV, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, CBS News, WWE Network, just to name a few. Basically, any streaming service you can think of, it's likely on the Roku Express.</p>
      <p>This is going to make for a really great stocking stuffer this year, and definitely worth picking up at this price. It's also going to be great as a Secret Santa gift this holiday season. And since it is being advertised at this same price for Black Friday, you might as well grab it now.</p>
