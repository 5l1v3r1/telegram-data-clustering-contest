        <b>It appears it's shade season as BBNaija's Tacha keeps firing shots at who many suspect to be her former fellow housemate and winner of the Pepper Dem Gang season, Mercy.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The two ladies who fought back in the BBNaija house appeared to have resumed their beef for each other and are busy throwing shades on social media. <b>Legit.ng </b>earlier shared how Tacha warned against 'getting too <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276857-plastic-melts---bbnaija-tacha-throws-shade-social-media.html">close to the heater, as plastic melts</a>' her post was taken by many to be a message for Mercy who is alleged to have gone under the knife to enhance her behind.</p>
      <p>Mercy also appeared to have taken shots of her own when she said something about <a href="https://legit.ng/1276995-mercy-throws-shade-tacha-money-moves.html">dancing on Instagram</a>, a one-time proud past time of Tacha. However, the war seems far from over as Tacha recently threw heavy shade on her Instagram page.</p>
      <p>In a recent post, Tacha shared a video of late Princess Diana talking about her being viewed as a threat. She also accompanied the video with a lengthy caption where she talked about how great women often face opposition before the ascend. Many have concluded that her post is directed at Mercy as well as some of her haters who can't understand why she has such loyal fans despite her controversial rise to fame.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Tacha has made another move on social media that has got her fans excited. The 23-year-old star took to her Instagram page on November 19, 2019, to wish <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277153-bbnaija-tacha-shares-video-video-calling-twitter-ceo.html">Twitter CEO and co-founder, Jack Dorsey, a happy birthday.</a></p>
      <p>Tacha posted a short snippet of the video call she had with the tech giant and she seemed very excited to be on a call with him even though their conversation was muted.</p>
