      <p>The history and significance of the much-loved Aran knit is to be explored at an upcoming talk on Sunday next, November 24, at the National Museum of Ireland - Country Life, Turlough Park, Castlebar.</p>
      <p>The illustrated talk will be delivered by Vawn Corrigan, author of Irish Aran: History, Tradition, Fashion, and will include a selection of archival and contemporary images.</p>
      <p>Aran jumpers - or sweaters - have long been a highly recognisable symbol abroad of Ireland and of Irish folk craft.</p>
      <p>The jumpers became particularly popular from the 1950s onwards when they began to be exported in their thousands to shops in America, Europe and Japan.</p>
      <p>The Aran knit was further popularised by their association with famous Irish folk singers like the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem.</p>
      <p>The Aran knit remains highly relevant today, not only as part of a rich craft heritage but as a continuing inspiration for modern fashion designers and some catwalk trends.</p>
      <p>In 2017, an Aran jumper from the National Museum of Ireland - Country Life featured in a major exhibition on world fashion at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</p>
      <p>The jumper was selected for Items: Is Fashion Modern?, an exhibition which explored 111 of the world’s most iconic fashion garments and accessories over the last century.</p>
      <p>Vawn Corrigan’s book on Irish Aran, published earlier this year, explores how Irish Aran knitting is a living tradition with a worldwide reach, which people continue to respond to.</p>
      <p>In Irish Aran: History, Tradition, Fashion, Corrigan details the history, mythology and growth of this iconic design.</p>
      <p>Ms Corrigan is a graduate of Trinity College Dublin and her writing on Irish craft has been published in the Irish Arts Review, Irish Antiques Journal, Ireland of the Welcomes and the international textiles magazine Selvedge. She is also a contributor to RTÉ radio's Sunday Miscellany.</p>
      <p>‘Exploring the History of Irish Aran’ is a free talk at 2 p.m. on Sunday, 24 November. Booking is required. Telephone +353 94 90 31751 or email educationtph@museum.ie.</p>
