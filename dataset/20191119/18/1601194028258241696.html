      <p>It looks like <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/cody-rhodes">Cody Rhodes</a> is ensuring that his father's legacy stays intact. According to <a href="https://411mania.com/wrestling/cody-rhodes-owns-name-trademark-dusty-rhodes">411Mania</a>, Dave Meltzer of <a href="https://www.f4wonline.com/">The Wrestling Observer Radio</a> revealed that Cody Rhodes currently owns the name of his father Dusty Rhodes. Yesterday, it was also <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/aew-trademarks-vince-mcmahon-s-comments-about-their-company">reported</a> that Cody had filed to trademark "The Match Beyond", which was the name that described his father's creation, War Games, which WWE currently owns.</p>
      <p>For the better part of the year, Cody Rhodes has <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/aew-dynamite-will-feature-wcw-themed-event-in-january-2020">trademarked</a> old WCW PPV names such as "Bash At The Beach," "Battlebowl," and "Bunkhouse Stampede." Yesterday, it was reported that AEW Dynamite will be entitled Bash at the Beach on January 15, 2020.</p>

      <p>Months ago, when it was reported that Cody was trademarking these old WCW PPVs, he noted that they were not all for AEW, but rather he wanted to reclaim some of his father's 'cattle' back.</p>

      <h4>The Legacy of Dusty Rhodes</h4>
      <p>There is no doubting that the legacy of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/dusty-rhodes-wrestler">Dusty Rhodes</a> is unparalleled. He was a creative genius, journeyman, and knew what it took to get people to watch his matches. His gimmick as a working class man captivated a nation and his "Hard Times" promo still stands the test of time.</p>

      <h4>Why does Cody Rhodes own his father's ring name?</h4>
      <p>Dave Meltzer says that Cody wanted to write a book on his father when he first left WWE. He further speculates that the book could be on the back burner since his dual duties as a performer and executive take up most of his time. Meltzer also added that when Cody did want to do it, he couldn't at the time because WWE owned the name and trademark for Dusty Rhodes.</p>
      <p>It's now a different story as Cody Rhodes could even turn his father's life story into a book or even a movie, since he now owns the rights. Now, that would be something. Who would make a good Dusty Rhodes? All that can be said is that Dusty Rhodes was incredibly unique and it would take someone special to play him.</p>
