      <h1>Google rolls out updated ‘My Devices’ page for G Suite users</h1>
      <h2>Along with the new look, the refreshed 'My Devices' page now supports Chromebooks, laptops and more</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:48:14+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/jonathan-lamont" target="_blank">Jonathan Lamont</a></address>
      <p>Google’s little-known G Suite feature, ‘My Devices,’ has received a Material Design makeover.</p>
      <p>The search giant announced the changes <a href="https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2019/11/new-my-devices-page-find-manage-devices.html">via a blog post</a> which highlighted changes like the inclusion of “desktop devices,” more detailed device information and more.</p>
      <p>For those who aren’t familiar with the My Devices page, it’s a website that acts similarly to the ‘Find My Device’ feature on Android. However, it works with Google-connected devices through G Suite. It allows users to ping their devices, as well as remotely wipe and lock them.</p>
      <p>Further, the new layout retains all the previous functionality. In other words, you’ll be able to see all the hardware linked with a G Suite account, as well as extended and detailed device information.</p>
      <p>The biggest change is the addition of desktop devices, which means My Devices now shows Chromebooks, laptops and other desktop devices linked to a G Suite account. This will likely prove helpful to IT administrators who need to keep track of and manage hardware utilized by their organization.</p>

      <p>Finally, My Devices now exists under a new URL — ‘<a href="http://mydevices.google.com/">mydevices.google.com</a>‘ — which should make it easier to get to now. That said, the page isn’t live for everyone yet. When I tried it out, I received a ‘404’ error. Google says it can take around one to three days for it to roll out to all domains.</p>
      <p>Once rolled out, the new My Devices page will be the default for all G Suite accounts.</p>
