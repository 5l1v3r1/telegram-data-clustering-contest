      <p>Aavin has put in place a new system to replace leaky milk packets in the city. All its 27 zonal offices will be provided with 25 packets of milk each so that customers can get replacements quickly.</p>
      <p>“This is being brought into practice to replace packets that get damaged in transit or during handling. Sometimes a dent or a bend in the milk tub could cause damage to the cover,” said Aavin managing director C. Kamaraj.</p>
      <p>Aavin, the popular brand of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Milk Producers Federation, has also asked its staff at dairies to check film rolls while placing them in the packing line.</p>
      <p>“Earlier, our staff at depots or those delivering to customers would ask them to adjust since only a small quantity of milk is lost in the leak. But we want to change it,” he said.</p>
      <p>Aavin also increased the thickness of the plastic covers to 63 microns a couple of years ago to prevent leaks. However, a milk supplier of south Chennai said that going all the way to the zonal office for one pack with a leak was a waste of time and money.</p>
      <p>“Already we work without a break. We don’t have holidays. The vehicle delivery person gets 24 packets additionally for 600 tubs of milk. Each tub contains 24 packets and the packs are stuffed with no space in the tub. That just adds to the pressure and when tubs are stacked on top of each other, packets start leaking. The delivery truck drivers ask us to adjust. We don’t pass on leaking packs to customers but instead use them at home,” he explained.</p>
      <p>Another retailer alleged that the 25 packets at the zonal offices would only lead to the staff siphoning off the packets. “They can just show some damaged packets and say they were brought in by customers. Private milk brands have a simpler system for replacing leaks, the delivery truck in the return direction just picks up the damaged packs and gives them replacements,” he said.</p>
