      <h1>LaMelo Ball: I’m already better than brother Lonzo</h1>

      <p>LaMelo Ball is expected to be among the top picks in the 2020 NBA draft. Lavar Ball’s youngest son told a teammate in Australia he believes he’s already a better player than his older brother, Lonzo.</p>
      <p>Lonzo Ball was the second overall pick in the draft in 2017 by the Lakers, before he was traded to New Orleans in the blockbuster deal that sent Anthony Davis to Los Angeles this summer.</p>
      <p>Former NBA guard Aaron Brooks, a teammate with the Illawara Hawks of the National Basketball League, recalled in a lengthy <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2862307-the-life-of-lamelo">Bleacher Report feature</a> on Ball this week that when he told the 18-year-old “your brother’s really good,” LaMelo stared back at him and replied, “I’m better than him.”</p>
      <p>“The stuff I see is NBA stuff. His IQ is amazing,” added Brooks, who played 10 years in the NBA with seven teams. “There’s no doubt about it. He’s ready for the NBA. His ceiling is so high.”</p>
      <p>The always-outspoken Lavar Ball hasn’t allowed his youngest son to lead the typical teenager’s life, pulling him out of his California high school in 2018 to play professionally in Lithuania before moving on to Australia this season to prepare for the 2020 draft. The 6-7 LaMelo Ball called the Lithuania experience “like a scary movie,” but he defended his attention-seeking father’s decisions for his career.</p>
      <p>“It gets attached to us. I mean, at the end of the day, that’s my dad. I know him. He knows me. That’s always going to be a bond,” LaMelo said about Lavar Ball. “I just play basketball. Whatever he say, he say.</p>
      <p>“You not gonna turn on your dad. You only get one dad in the world. People say to me, ‘He’s ruining your career.’ I mean, no he’s not, because he made me who I am.”</p>
      <p>LaMelo Ball lives in Australia with former NBA player, Jermaine Jackson, who serves as the player’s business manager. While LaMelo says he “just (wants) to play basketball,” Jackson added in the story that “people done made money off this kid for years. I don’t really want to use the word, but it’s damn near like he’s a prostitute.”</p>
      <p>“People don’t know me, know me as a person. They don’t know what I’ve been through,” LaMelo Ball added. “People don’t look at you as a human. People look at you as a dollar sign. People think playing overseas is easy. It’s not.</p>
      <p>“I just saw life different. Not being a normal kid, not going to dance parties, not going to school…I don’t know any other way.”</p>
