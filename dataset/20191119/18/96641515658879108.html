      <h1>'Catan' AR game could ride on Niantic's tech</h1>
      <h2>Is there a big crossover between board and mobile gamers?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:38:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>If you're Niantic and you're planning a follow-up to augmented reality hits like <i><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/31/pokemon-go-1-billion-downloads/">Pokémon Go</a></i> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-19-niantic-adds-gifting-harry-potter-wizards-unite.html"><i>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</i></a>, what famous property do you work with next? Apparently, the answer is a hardcore board game. A <a href="https://www.catanworldexplorers.com/">product page</a>, source code <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ingress/comments/dyicxv/catan_world_explorers_tos_suggests_this_is_niantic/">sleuths</a> and <i>TechCrunch</i> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/is-this-niantics-next-game/">tipsters</a> suggest that Niantic is partnering on <i>Catan: World Explorers</i>, an AR title based on the classic colony-building game <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/23/catan-vr-hands-on/"><i>Settlers of Catan</i></a>. While the game's mechanics aren't completely clear, it looks like it really is an attempt to squeeze Niantic's basic formula into <i>Catan</i>'s world of hexagonal grids, road building and resource trading.</p>
      <p>Neither <i>Catan</i>'s creators nor Niantic have officially established their partnership or set a release date, but Niantic's fingerprints are all over the code. <i>TechCrunch</i> also said it confirmed the cooperation from sources inside Niantic. <i>Catan</i>'s owners had <a href="https://www.catan.com/news/2019-10-28/catan-world-explorers-announced">acknowledged</a> the game's existence in late October, but not the Niantic connection.</p>
      <p>This probably won't be a runaway hit like some of Niantic's properties. There are only so many people who are both enthusiastic <i>Catan</i> players and mobile gamers. However, that's not necessarily the goal. Niantic has been gradually positioning itself <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/28/niantic-developers-use-pokemon-go-ar-platform/">as an AR platform</a> in addition to a game studio. It doesn't have to worry so much about creating dynamite hits of its own as it does convincing <i>others</i> to make games using its technology. Even if <i>Pokémon</i> and <i>Harry Potter</i> eventually fizzle out, Niantic will be happy if it becomes the go-to choice whenever someone wants to make an AR title.</p>
