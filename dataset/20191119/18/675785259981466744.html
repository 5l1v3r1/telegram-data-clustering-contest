      <h2>Pinley RFC president Gary Marks insisted the Midlands Two West South League clash with Spartans RFC was still entertaining - despite neither side being able to break the deadlock</h2>

      <p>Fans were left astonished after they watched two teams play out the "world's dullest ever rugby match" which incredibly finished NIL-NIL.</p>
      <p>Pinley RFC and Spartans RFC defied odds of 1,000/1 after they missed six penalties and failed to score a single try between them during the 80 minute game.</p>
      <p>The two amateur teams could not break the deadlock as they battled it out in the Midlands Two West South League at Wyken Croft in Coventry on Saturday November 16.</p>
      <p>Supporters looked on in amazement as both sides repeatedly cancelled each other out before the encounter amazingly finished 0-0.</p>
      <p>No game of professional rugby union has ever finished scoreless and the last time it happened at the top level was between Scotland and New Zealand in 1964.</p>

      <p>Pinley RFC president Gary Marks insisted the game was still entertaining despite opposition supporters in the 200 strong crowd branding it "the dullest game ever."</p>
      <p>He said: "I've been there for 40 years and I've never seen a nil-nil.</p>
      <p>"It was entertaining, but defences won the day. Both sides are known for having a strong set of forwards. It was a bruising encounter.</p>

      <p>"If there'd been another half an hour neither team would've scored. It was one of those days.</p>
      <p>"Spartans missed five kicks, including one to win the game which hit the woodwork.</p>
      <p>"In the first half the Pinley fly-half Harry Marks, my son, missed one from in front of the posts. I think there was a couple of try-scoring chances butchered by both sides.</p>
      <p>"Pinley had a try disallowed because the referee deemed there to be a knock-on. In a separate incident a Pinley player dropped the ball over the line."</p>

      <p>Pinley captain Sam Nicholls, 28, added: "I've never played in a nil nil game before and I can only remember playing in one other draw in 11 years.</p>
      <p>"It was a decent game, there wasn't lots of boring pick and go.</p>
      <p>"In the first half we must've had 20 to 25 minutes of possession in their half but they kept us out.</p>
      <p>"We missed a kick from in front of the posts and could've scored two tries. In the second half it evened out and their lad missed five kicks.</p>
      <p>"One bounced off the post at the end then we ran it and knocked it on. Both teams defended really well. We're known for our defence and often hold teams, especially at home.</p>
      <p>"I don't think this will happen again next game. Hopefully we'll score a lot more points - if we get a new kicker."</p>

      <p>But fans of Spartans, based in Sutton Coldfield, who travelled to the game said they were left "bored stiff" watching the nil-nil unfold.</p>
      <p>Supporter Steven Bridgman, 49, said: "I'm not sure how you can call a nil-nil game of rugby entertaining - I was bored stiff watching it in the cold waiting for something to happen."</p>
      <p>Nick Say, 68, added: "It has to be be the dullest ever games of rugby I've seen. I've never known anything like it.</p>
      <p>"You get them in football all the time - but I've been watching rugby for over 50 years and I've never heard of this happening before."</p>
      <p>The Rugby Football Union (RFU), the governing body for the sport, said they do not hold records for amateur games that have finished nil-nil.</p>
      <p>But bookmakers Ladbrokes revealed the odds of it happening are around 1,000/1.</p>
      <p>Alex Apati, of Ladbrokes, said: "Plenty of eyebrows have been raised on our trading floor at this one.</p>
      <p>"It's not exactly something we see every day. We're looking forward to seeing how the reverse fixture pans out with Pinley and Spartans already pulling off a 1000/1 result."</p>
