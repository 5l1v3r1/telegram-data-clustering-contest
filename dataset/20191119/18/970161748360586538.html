      <p>A social studies teacher sent naked photos of his ex-girlfriend to the woman’s brother after she blocked his calls, police say.</p>
      <p>Jason Hohlt, 42, was arrested Monday over claims he forwarded the woman’s nudes via Facebook Messenger in July.</p>
      <p>Hohlt, who works at Pike High <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/school/">School</a> in Indianapolis, Indiana, reportedly shared the revenge porn as part of an orchestrated campaign of harassment against the woman.</p>
      <p>It is unclear how their relationship ended, but Hohlt reportedly continued to call the woman from different numbers.</p>
      <p>He is also said to have pestered her family members on social media before resorting to sending the intimate snaps.</p>

      <p>After the woman’s brother received the nudes, he told his sister, who contacted police, the <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2019/11/19/pike-high-school-teacher-coach-charged-revenge-porn-case/4236773002/">Indy Star</a> reported.</p>

      <p>A judge subsequently issued a warrant which yielded data that is said to prove that the photos were sent by Hohlt.</p>
      <p>Hohlt was placed on leave from his job on Monday, shortly after the allegations against him emerged.</p>
      <p>Pike Township Superintendent Flora Reichanadter said: ‘We have no reason to believe that any of our students were impacted by the educator’s alleged behavior.’</p>
      <p>The teacher was charged with distribution of an intimate image, a misdemeanor, and has since been released without having to post bond.</p>
      <p>Hohlt has been charged under a new law, which came into effect in July.</p>
      <p>Republican State Senator Aaron Freeman, who tabled that bill, told <a href="https://www.wibc.com/news/local-news/pike-township-teacher-charged-revenge-porn-investigation">WIBC</a>: ‘We really wanted to send the message that this kind of behavior shouldn’t be tolerated in Indiana…</p>
      <p>‘To give folks hopefully some protection and certainly at least a recourse, somewhere to go, some action to take if they find themselves the victim of this kind of thing.’</p>
