      <p>The actress with the inimitable smile and the crinkle in her eye that made her one of America's sweetest sweethearts is another year wiser—and considering her best movies are worth celebrating every day, we figured now was the time to take stock of the gifts she's given <i>us</i> through the years.</p>

      <p>Sometimes the best feel-good remedy is to hit the club and dance, especially if your unreliable boyfriend has been rendered microscopic and is navigating a space capsule that's been injected into <b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/martin_short">Martin Short</a></b>'s body:</p>
