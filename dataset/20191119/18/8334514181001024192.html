      <p>RABAT (Reuters) - King Mohammed VI of Morocco on Tuesday appointed former Interior Minister and ambassador to France Chakib Benmoussa as head of a committee to tackle social inequality and poverty, the Royal Palace said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The King said in July that the committee was intended to design a “new development model” to reform areas such as education, health, agriculture, investment and taxation.</p>
      <p>The monarch acknowledged then that infrastructure achievements of recent years, such as highways, high-speed railways, ports, renewable energy and urban development had not been felt by all sectors of society.</p>
      <p>Morocco is 123rd in the U.N. Human Development Index, as rural areas lag behind in access to education and health services.</p>
      <p>The number of poor Moroccans, or those at risk of poverty, stands at nearly 9 million, or 24% of the population, according to a World Bank Report last month.</p>
      <p>Due to a decline in agricultural output, the International Monetary Fund expects Morocco’s economy to grow 2.8% in 2019 after 3% in 2018, a rate that cannot create enough jobs in a society where one in four young people is unemployed.</p>
