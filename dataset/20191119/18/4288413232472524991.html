      <h1>Olympus CEO Backtracks, says Camera Business May Be for Sale: Report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:03:35+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://petapixel.com/author/dlcade/" target="_blank">DL Cade</a></address>
      <p>The back and forth between Olympus and the public continues, and the news is grim. After <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/11/14/olympus-officially-denies-rumors-that-it-will-shut-down-its-camera-business/">officially denying</a> rumors of an imminent imaging business shut down, Olympus’ CEO backtracked on some previous comments today, implying that the company’s camera business may be up for sale.</p>
      <p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-19/olympus-job-cuts-may-come-as-push-into-medical-tech-intensifies"><i>Bloomberg</i></a>, Olympus CEO Yasuo Takeuchi said that the company is preparing for job cuts “in due course” in order to “improve performance” and meet its business goals. The article mostly restates what we already know from previous reports—that the company is planning to focus on the medical business—but it did contain one dynamite piece of new information:</p>
      <blockquote>Takeuchi also backtracked on some of his comments in the past that the camera business was not for sale, saying that may not be the case anymore.</blockquote>
      <p>This is bad news for anybody who has been adamant that Olympus wasn’t going to sell or shut down its camera business.</p>
      <p>As we said <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/11/12/rumor-claims-olympus-will-shut-down-its-camera-division-within-a-year/">in our original report</a>, anybody who believes they know the answer to this question with 100% certainty is overstating their position. Olympus’ recently released <a href="https://www.olympus-global.com/ir/data/pdf/corporate_strategy_20191106.pdf">corporate strategy</a> makes next-to-no mention of its imaging business beyond endoscopes, and the company’s <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/11/14/olympus-officially-denies-rumors-that-it-will-shut-down-its-camera-business/">“rebuttal”</a> of the recent rumors could be characterized as lukewarm at best.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-19/olympus-job-cuts-may-come-as-push-into-medical-tech-intensifies"><i>Bloomberg</i> points out</a>, the imaging unit makes up just 6% of Olympus business and is “the lowest margin and lowest growth businesses in Olympus’s portfolio.” As new board members and investors pressure Olympus to re-evaluate its various businesses, it wouldn’t surprise anybody for Olympus’ camera division to go the way of Samsung.</p>

      <p><b>UPDATE</b>: The Olympus global communications team has sent us the following statement following our coverage of the <i>Bloomberg</i> report. We have asked for clarification on Mr. Takeuchi’s exact statements, and will publish an update if and when we hear anything concrete.</p>
      <blockquote>As announced in our Corporate Strategy, Olympus is further focusing on our Medical business and follows the strong ambition for all of our businesses to be profitable and contribute to our overall business objectives. In that regard, we are continuously evaluating our overall portfolio, as announced in our Corporate Strategy on November 6, 2019.<br/>For Imaging, however, we currently have no plans to sell the business. The task is therefore to stabilize and strengthen its market position. To achieve that, we are actively running marketing activities, and have already established a clear and exciting product roadmap for the coming months and years. We are actively pursuing future technology developments that will enhance photography and video for creators. Furthermore, Imaging is and will continue to be an important technology and innovation driver for our other businesses.<br/>Our Imaging business features a unique product portfolio. Olympus products are compact and lightweight, feature market leading image stabilization and autofocus. Many of our high-end products are also splash-proof. No other product offers customers this level of optical excellence paired with the highest mobility.<br/>Just last month we launched our new OM-D E-M5 Mark III – a light yet feature packed addition to our semi-pro camera portfolio, inheriting pro-features like a high precision AF from our OM-D E-M1 Mark II model. Furthermore, we have announced the development of M.ZUIKO DIGITAL ED 150-400mm F4.5 TC1.25x IS PRO earlier this year to be launched by next year. Customers can follow our break-free campaign on various channels and worldwide.</blockquote>
