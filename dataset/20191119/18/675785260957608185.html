      <p>Any avid traveller will know that a good backpack is essential, for keeping your essentials close and safe.</p>
      <p>The kind of backpack you'll need will largely depend on the activities you'll be doing. If you know you're going to be somewhere rainy - a waterproof backpack is the best option. Likewise if you'll only be travelling short distances, you'll likely only need a small backpack.</p>
      <p>Either way, you'll want to make sure your backpack is stylish, comfortable on your back and easily adjusted to suit your needs.</p>
      <p>Wherever you're off to on adventures, we've rounded up 10 of the best travel backpacks you can buy now to help get you on your way.</p>
