      <p>The DC Extended Universe has had a fascinating life in theaters, full of peaks and valleys. The biggest of said valleys remains to be Zack Snyder's <i>Justice League</i>, which was a box office flop and critical failure when it hit theaters in 2017. Snyder didn't actually get to finish the movie he started, as he departed the project after a family tragedy and Joss Whedon was brought on to finish it on time. Campaigns for the original Snyder Cut of the movie has <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484404/why-this-could-be-a-huge-week-for-justice-leagues-release-the-snyder-cut-movement">gained a ton of traction</a> lately, and now Deathstroke actor Joe Manganiello has joined the call.</p>
      <p>Joe Manganiello made his DC debut during the post-credits scene of <i>Justice League</i> alongside Lex Luthor. But following the movie's poor performance in theaters, it's unclear if/when he might pop up again. But following the 2-year anniversary of <i>Justice League</i>, Joe Manganiello has joined the call for the Snyder Cut, posting stills from his role on social media. Check it out.</p>

      <p>Well, add Joe Manganiello's name to the long list of people who want to see Zack Snyder's original vision for <i>Justice League</i>. Plenty of cast and crew members from the movie have put their support behind the viral movement, which appears to be gaining speed over the past few months.</p>
      <p>Joe Manganiello's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5B4fj6hrtL/?utm_source=ig_embed">Instagram</a> post came with a few images of himself in Deathstroke's costume, both helmeted and not. The suit itself is a comic book accurate version of Slade Wilson's gear. This includes his pair of dual swords, guns, and plenty of ammo. Deathstroke is a lethal villain on the page and screen, and has been known to be a rogue of Batman's, as well as the Teen Titans.</p>
      <p>The last image that Joe Manganiello included in his post was one of Zack Snyder at work. Snyder was the visionary behind the DCEU's inception, directing <i>Man of Steel</i>, <i>Batman v Superman</i>, and <i>Justice League</i>. The filmmaker was setting up the future of the shared universe when he suffered a family tragedy, and had to leave the director's chair. What resulted was a drastically different blockbuster, influenced by Joss Whedon and the studio itself.</p>
      <p>The campaign for the Snyder Cut began almost immediately after <i>Justice League</i> was released, but originally seemed like a pipe dream. Given how much money Warner Bros. lost on the project, it seemed unlikely that the studio would put any money into the distribution of another cut. But the fans haven't given up, and there's been more press around the movement than ever.</p>

      <p>Said fans crowdfunded money to get their message <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481693/zack-snyder-speechless-over-release-the-snyder-cut-efforts-at-new-york-comic-con">out at San Diego Comic-Con</a> this summer, advertising their hopes for the Snyder Cut. Zack Snyder himself has <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484947/supermans-resurrection-teased-by-zack-snyders-latest-snyder-cut-image">been sharing unseen images</a> from his cut of the movie. And most recently, even the likes of Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484990/gal-gadot-and-ben-affleck-join-justice-league-co-stars-to-support-snyder-cut-release">posted their support</a> of the movement on social media.</p>
      <p>While it <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485004/despite-the-snyder-cut-going-viral-warner-bros-reportedly-isnt-moving-forward-anytime-soon">doesn't seem like Warner Bros.</a> has any concrete plans to make the Snyder Cut happen, it's clear that there's an interest in the alternate version of <i>Justice League</i>. But considering its unfinished nature and the studio's poor history with the blockbuster, that might never happen. We'll just have to wait and see.</p>
      <p>The next installment in the DCEU is <i>Birds of Prey</i> on February 7th, 2020.
