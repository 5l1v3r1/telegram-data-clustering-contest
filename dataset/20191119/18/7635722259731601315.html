      <h1>Brian O'Driscoll's noticed a promising evolution from Munster</h1>

        <b>Munster made a winning start to the Heineken Champions Cup and their evolution has intrigued Brian O'Driscoll.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Johann van Graan's side beat Ospreys 32-13 to earn a bonus point on the road.</p>
      <p>Over the summer, Munster also strengthened their coaching setup, including with senior coach Stephen Larkham.</p>
      <p>Ireland legend Brian O'Driscoll joined us <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9GP2s6uOYU"><b>on<i> Off The Ball</i></b></a> to review the weekend's action and also shared his view on Munster's performance and evolution.</p>
      <p>"I kind of liked Munster," he said.</p>
      <h3>Great Combination</h3>
      <p>"Munster - in this tournament with the way they have appeared to evolve as well and brought in a new coaching ticket that are very respected coaches in [Graham] Rowntree and Larkham, have a wealth of experience at the highest level - I just thought it's potentially a great combination.</p>
      <p>"And I think they've come on no doubt from last year - and they've still been getting to consecutive semi-finals.</p>
      <p>"I don't think they're the finished article yet. But I've definitely seen an evolution from them and a nasty edge to them that maybe was lacking in the last few years."</p>
      <p>He homed in on two sides to Munster's game against Ospreys to highlight the evolution.</p>
      <p>"They had a real ferocity to the way they were hitting rucks and counter-rucking. I think after 45 minutes, I heard Sam Warburton say that it was 10 offloads to zero. So they're evolving their game. They're pushing the pass a little bit more - a little bit like Leinster of a couple of seasons ago. That can only come from what happens at training throughout the week.</p>
      <p>"So clearly they're practicing and working on their multi-phase and realising that's the way the game is going how they need to evolve with it. I think that's probably Larkham."</p>
