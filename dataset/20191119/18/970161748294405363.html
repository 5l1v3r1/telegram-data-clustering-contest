      <p>The Apprentice viewers were left feeling rather confused following last week’s episode after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/the-apprentice-viewers-spot-mystery-man-lying-on-the-floor-of-the-boardroom-and-there-are-so-many-questions-11124100/">noticing a mystery man lying on the floor of the boardroom.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/the-apprentice-fired-candidate-jemelin-artigas-admits-she-would-cry-her-eyes-out-and-wake-up-at-4am-11091506/">Jemelin Artigas was the latest candidate to be fired</a> from the BBC show, and as some of the contestants left the boardroom, fans couldn’t help but spot a man lying on the floor.</p>
      <p>But who was he and why was he lying there?</p>
      <p>And now we don’t have to wonder any more because Thomas Skinner has revealed who it actually was.</p>
      <p>He took to Twitter to put those rumours to bed and informed his followers that it was Ryan-Mark Parsons – although we are not sure we believe the reason behind it – what do you think?</p>
      <p>He tweeted: ‘People keep asking me who was the geeza laying on the floor under the table in last tasks boardroom! Well I can actually reveal it was @ryanmarkparsons</p>

      <p>‘Foot masseuse, the #Pig flys him in from Hamburg every Wednesday to keep his feet relaxed during the boardroom! #TheApprentice’</p>

      <p>The news also follows after<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/the-apprentices-lottie-lion-and-ryan-mark-tell-fans-they-are-dating-after-romance-rumours-11166557/"> Ryan-Mark and Lottie Lion told their fans they were ‘dating’.</a></p>
      <p>A fan of The Apprentice tweeted Ryan-Mark after Wednesday night’s show to comment on their friendship.</p>
      <p>They tweeted: ‘Just watched last night’s episode of the apprentice, another brilliant episode. My favourites so far are<br/>@LottieLion1 @ryanmarkparsons and @ImLewisEllis.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve noticed Lottie and Ryan-Mark have quite the friendship.’</p>

        <figcaption>Lottie Lion also weighed in on the romance rumours (Picture: BBC)</figcaption>

      <p>The candidate then added fuel to the fire by responding: ‘We’re actually dating. EXCLUSIVE.’</p>
      <p>For week seven, the teams were mixed up again and this week’s challenge was probably one of the hardest yet – they had to re-brand the country of Finland.</p>
      <p>The contestants had to create an advertising campaign to entice UK visitors during the summer months. Half of the team were sent to Finland to film the TV advert, whilst the rest created a marketing campaign and a digital billboard to be displayed at Piccadilly Circus.</p>

      <p>During her time in the boardroom, Jemelin admitted she felt ‘overlooked’ by Lord Sugar as he ‘failed to see’ everything she was doing.</p>

      <p>‘He did not make the right decision,’ she explained.</p>
      <p>‘I felt like I did so much and it was overlooked a little bit and he failed to see everything I did because I wasn’t the loudest or an attention seeker.</p>
      <p>‘I wasn’t meant to go but then I couldn’t see myself as his business partner at that point.</p>
      <p>‘I think Ryan-Mark should have gone because has been there for seven weeks, where has he been and what has he done? He has not put himself in the firing line once.</p>
      <p>‘And then you have Marianne, she was the project manager, yet I did the ad. Thomas did the billboard and she didn’t let me pitch so I think Marianne should have gone. She made a fatal mistake not letting me pitch.’</p>
