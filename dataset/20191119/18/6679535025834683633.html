      <h1>Two Post Office Passport Seva Kendras in Malabar in the offing</h1>
      <h2>Kozhikode regional office issues most number of passports in the State</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:01:13+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Biju-Govind-235/" target="_blank">Biju Govind</a></address>
      <p>After keeping it in abeyance for quite sometime, the Ministry of External Affairs has decided to revive the proposal for opening two Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs) in Malabar – in Wayanad and Malappuram.</p>
      <p>Though it has been the declared policy of the Ministry to start either a Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) or POPSK in all parliamentary constituencies, Wayanad is the only district in north Kerala where such a facility does not exist. As of now, residents in Wayanad have to access the PSK either at Kozhikode or Vadakara.</p>
      <p>M. Rahees, Regional Passport Officer, Kozhikode, told <i>The Hindu </i>on Tuesday that plans were afoot to set up one POPSK at Mananthavady and the other at Tirur. Previously the proposal was to establish one at Kalpetta.</p>
      <p>At present, the Regional Passport Office, Kozhikode caters to five districts – Kozhikode, Kannur, Kasaragod, Wayanad, Malappuram – and Mahe(Union Territory). And PSKs are functioning at Kannur, Payyannur, Kozhikode, Vadakara and Malappuram. The first POPSK under the regional office was opened at the Kasaragod head post office three years ago.</p>
      <p>One of the reasons cited for putting on hold the proposal for starting the POPSK in Wayanad and Malappuram is that the Ministry wanted to ensure quality services, which require infrastructure facilities and basic amenities to the applicants.</p>
      <p>While the PSKs are successfully managed through Tata Consultancy Services, the POPSK has to be serviced through the Department of Posts. As of now, 424 POPSKs havd been made operational in the country.</p>
      <p>The proposal for establishing a POPSK at Tirur and also at Ponnani was made when the Malappuram Regional Passport was wound up and merged with the Kozhikode Regional Passport Office two years ago.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, the Kozhikode office issues more passports among the three regional passport offices in the State. It issued nearly 4.48 lakh passports till November 18.</p>
      <p>The Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram offices have issued 4,21,850 and 1,78,933 passports during the period.</p>
