      <p>Hollywood's latest car flick <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/check-out-the-epic-racing-action-in-ford-v-ferrari">Ford v Ferrari</a> is receiving race reviews as a high-velocity period sports drama and bromance. Starring Matt Damon as Caroll Shelby and Christian Bale as Ken Miles, the movie covers <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/great-automotive-rivalries-shelby-vs-ferrari">Ford's quest to beat Ferrari at Le Mans</a> in the 1960s, and the creation of the GT40 that eventually did just that.</p>
      <p>For the film, a replica of the GT40 driven by Ken Miles at Le Mans was built by California based Superformance. It was driven by Christian Bale during the filming of the movie and then used for Red Carpet and promotional events. Now, it's going up for auction with <a href="https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0120-397442/1966-superformance-ford-gt40-mkii/?utm_source=motorious.com&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=motorious">Mecum</a> at the beginning of next year.</p>

      <p>There were two cars built and prepared in the iconic Gulf Blue livery, the other being Bruce McLaren's black GT40. Despite structural and mechanical details, both are meticulously detailed to replicate the original cars built by Caroll Shelby. Topping it off, the Number 1 car has been signed by Charlie Agapiou, Ken Miles' crew chief in 1966, and Peter Miles, Ken's son.</p>
      <p>The unibody frame is built from electro-galvanized steel and features a pressed steel roof. Originally, the MKII Gt40 was powered by a 7.0-liter engine mated to a four-speed manual transmission. Powering the replica is a specially prepped Roush 427IR V-8 engine stroked to 511 CI and making 600 horsepower.</p>

      <p>Inside, the detailing has been taken down to the screws. Everything from the toggle switches to the Alcantara racing seats has been sourced or replicated. There's even Smiths instruments and a Motolita steering wheel installed. Underneath, the suspension is independent all around and runs on Bilstein shocks with H&amp;R springs and anti-roll bar. It looks like an old GT40 but will drive more like a newer <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/gt">Ford GT</a>.</p>
      <p>There's been no estimate made on the value of this MKII GT40 replica, but we know it won't be cheap. The auction will be at Mecum's Kissimmee 2020 event that runs from January 2-12.</p>
