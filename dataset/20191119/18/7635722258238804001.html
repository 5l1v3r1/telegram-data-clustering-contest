      <h1>Prodigal son Rory Feely returns to St. Pat's after two years away</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:23:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.newstalk.com/author/richiemccormack" target="_blank">Richie McCormack</a></address>

        <b>St. Patrick's Athletic have continued building for the new season by re-signing Rory Feely. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The 22-year old spent the past two seasons with Waterford having originally left the Saints in January of 2018.</p>
      <p>A player of great versatility, Feely played the majority of last season at the RSC at right-back, but can also fill-in at centre-half and as a defensive midfielder. He played 32 games for the Blues last term.</p>
      <p>Feely <a href="https://twitter.com/stpatsfc/status/1196843520138629121?s=20">looks back</a> on his original spell at Richmond Park with fondness, "It was a successful underage career - we won the U19 league. We did well the next year.</p>
      <p>"When I was breaking into the first team, we did well - lost in the final, which was unfortunate.</p>
      <p>"Breaking into the first team under [ex-Pats boss] Liam [Buckley], it was a really good experience.</p>
      <p>"I got to play with some experienced players, I got to learn a new position at centre-back. It was great, and just unfortunately it didn't work out at that time and I found myself down at Waterford but... I'm back now".</p>
      <p>Feely is Pat's third major arrival under recently-recruited manager Stephen O'Donnell, following <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/sport/robbie-benson-joins-st-patricks-athletic-dundalk-924676">Robbie Benson</a> and <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/sport/st-pats-recruit-winger-jay-mcclelland-2020-season-923111">Jay McClelland</a>.</p>

      <p>Feely says O'Donnell has sold him a promising vision of life at Pat's from next season, "As he said himself, he's looking for young ambitious players, and that's the kind of squad I was looking at and want to be part of.</p>
      <p>"He's got a clear message across that it's going to be a very ambitious squad, it's going to be good training sessions - everyone's going to be active and enjoying themselves.</p>
      <p>"If that's there in a club, the whole squad's happy and the morale's up then results can only go up from that."</p>
