      <p>STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Drinks group Coca-Cola (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/KO.N">KO.N</a>) said on Tuesday it would start using PET bottles in Sweden made only of recycled plastic in a first step towards expanding its use of recycled plastic in western Europe.</p>

      <p>Coca-Cola said the switch at its Jordbro factory south of Stockholm would enable the company to use around 3,500 tonnes less of virgin plastic annually.</p>
      <p>The company also said increasing the share of recycled material in packaging was an efficient way to reduce its C02 footprint.</p>
      <p>“That means a 25% reduction of CO2 emissions annually compared with before the transition, when the portfolio consisted of around 40% recycled plastic,” it said, referring to its Swedish operations.</p>
      <p>The group uses 128 billion PET bottles a year globally, of which 205 million are in Sweden, company spokeswoman Frida Keane said.</p>
      <p>Coca-Cola and rivals such as PepsiCo (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/PEP.O">PEP.O</a>) and Nestle (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/NESN.S">NESN.S</a>) are stepping up action to curb plastic use as the industry reacts to growing consumer concerns about global warming and plastic waste pollution.</p>
      <p>Environmental group Greenpeace said in October that Coca-Cola was the world’s biggest producer of plastic waste for the second year in a row.</p>
      <p>Keane said the move in Sweden was a first step toward a company ambition to use PET bottles from 50% recycled plastic in western Europe by the end of 2023.</p>
      <p>At group level, Coca-Cola’s recycled plastic ratio is 11% currently, and in western Europe, 27%, Keane said.</p>
      <p>Last year, Coca-Cola pledged to collect and recycle a bottle or can for every one it sells globally by 2030.</p>
      <p>Its move in Sweden, planned for the first quarter of 2020, is a joint initiative by the beverage maker and its bottling partner in western Europe, Coca-Cola European Partners CCEPC.L, Keane said.</p>
