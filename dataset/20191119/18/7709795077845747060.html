        <b>There was drama at Fairyhouse on Tuesday as Larquebuse, way behind and out of the picture turning for home, got up to dead-heat for first place.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the 150th Irish Grand National 2020 Mares Maiden Hurdle, it looked like 40/1 outsider Lunch For Adare had done enough to cause a shock.</p>
      <p>However, Larquebuse, in the colours of Cheveley Park Stud and ridden by Davy Russell for trainer Gordon Elliott, made an astonishing late rally to join Lunch For Adare right on the line.</p>
      <p>The fast-finisher had traded at the maximum odds of 1000/1 in-running on Betfair, but she finished like a train to force a photo, with the judge eventually declaring a dead-heat.</p>
