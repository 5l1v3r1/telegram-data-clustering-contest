      <p>India is uniquely positioned to carry out research that will help the needs of people with low purchasing power, said T. Ramasami, former secretary, Department of Science and Technology at University of Madras here on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Delivering the convocation address at the 162nd annual convocation of University of Madras, he said that global models of research and development were neither sustainable nor affordable. “The outcomes of research and development in the western world bypass more than 66 % of the global population,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Problems of the rich are being solved while those of the poor remain unaddressed,” he said, adding that India could pioneer in affordable innovations in low resource settings.</p>
      <h3>Leadership building</h3>
      <p>Highlighting that University of Madras had greatly contributed to the nation’s development, particularly with the ‘green’ and ‘white’ revolutions respectively in the agriculture and dairy sectors being led by the alumni of the university, he appealed to the university to focus on measures to create a pipeline of next generation leaders in various fields.</p>
      <p>He suggested the creation of 12 chair positions in honour of eminent alumni and formation of centres of excellence in trans-disciplinary areas.</p>
      <p>P. Duraisamy, vice-chancellor, University of Madras, presented the annual report. He also highlighted the achievements of the university. Governor Banwarilal Purohit presided over the convocation and awarded the degrees.</p>
      <p>A total of 884 graduands received their doctorates and degrees in person.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, another 94,190 graduands received in absentia.</p>
