          <b>Welcome back to Anime Horrors!</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>From <i>Dracula </i>and <i>Nosferatu</i>, to <i>30 Days of Night</i> and <i>Underworld</i>, vampires have provided many scares and thrills for audiences. Given how popular these nightmarish beings have been all throughout time, it is no surprise then that they’ve also made their way into anime. My first introduction to vampires in anime was that of the <i>Hellsing </i>OVA (a series I will absolutely be covering later in this column). For now, though, I want to bring your attention to an anime that is considered a classic.</p>
      <p>Recently I discovered the 1985 film of <b><i>Vampire Hunter D</i></b>; with only a slim understanding of the series, I decided to dive in and give the film a shot. Come to find out it didn’t take long for the atmosphere and characters to win me over. After the credits rolled, I knew I wanted to share this series with others, as well as speak to what I enjoyed about the film.</p>
      <p><i>Vampire Hunter D</i> originally began as a series of novels in 1983, written by <b>Hideyuki Kikuchi</b> and illustrated by <b>Yoshitaka Amano</b>. Not only have the novels expanded since their inception, <i>Vampire Hunter D</i> has also been adapted into manga, an audio drama, art books, and films.</p>
      <p>The series’ overall story follows D, who happens to be a dhampir; this is a being who is half human and half vampire. This combination allows D extraordinary vampire powers, as well as some immunity to vampire weaknesses. He is able to live among humans and walk during the day, but can suffer from a sun related illness depending on circumstances. Along with his massive sword and physical prowess, D is able to utilize various magical abilities. On his left hand lives a symbiotic being that has various magical abilities as well, including the power to suck up matter.</p>

      <p>D travels through a post-apocalyptic world set in the far future; the land makes for a unique blend of science fiction and high fantasy. From D’s robotic horse to gothic castles, to beings with psychic abilities, <i>Vampire Hunter D</i>’s world is truly unique. Along with said creatures, the world is built upon a fascinating history involving vampire nobility and war.</p>
      <p>The 1985 film involves a story that one can enjoy without requiring a deep knowledge of the series. We are introduced to a young girl named Doris who ends up being bitten by a powerful vampire noble. Doris eventually meets D, the latter taking on the job of defeating the vampire noble that aims to make Doris his wife.</p>

      <p>The animated action is a delightful blend of cheese and gore. Back around the time the film was released, action animation relied on repetitive static imagery to present the allusion of speed; while utilizing this style, the <i>Vampire Hunter D</i> film delivers on excitement in each action set piece. This is because the film’s overall presentation permeates an exciting and creepy mood throughout its runtime. The melodrama infused in some of D’s encounters lends itself to thrills and suspense; watching as D blends sword combat with touches of magic provides a fun element to fights.</p>
      <p>Along with the 1985 film, there’s also a 2000 animated film titled <b><i>Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust</i></b> that involves a higher level of animation (looking forward to checking it out myself). At the time of this writing, there have been plans to start a new <i>Vampire Hunter D</i> animated series, with the script for the pilot nearing completion back in 2018.</p>
      <p>While there are so many awesome anime out today, with more on the horizon, it is always wonderful discovering a classic. Even though I had briefly heard of the series before, having the chance to sit down and actually watch <i>Vampire Hunter D</i> was a joy; its unique science fiction and gothic world allows for an awesome presentation, all while offering fun action sequences. <i>Vampire Hunter D</i> is a classic in the world of horror anime; whether you are looking for a solid vampire story or some nostalgic joy, I would certainly encourage starting out with the 1985 film and exploring the anime from there.</p>
