      <p>With a few exceptions, most pedestrian underpasses in the city are badly maintained with garbage strewn all over and paan stains on walls and stairwells.</p>
      <p>However, this may soon change as the civic body is now contemplating handing over pedestrian underpasses to Smart City, which is already executing several projects in Bengaluru.</p>
      <p>According to sources in the BBMP, discussions with the Smart City authorities on handing them over have already taken place. “The underpasses are not being used in the desired manner. With poor maintenance and no security, pedestrians would rather cross a road at the grade level,” said an official.</p>
      <p>He admitted that the BBMP has been facing difficulties in maintaining these facilities that were meant to provide pedestrians with adequate infrastructure. “These underpasses were conceived years ago. For instance, the one near K.R. Market is fairly wide. However, the vendors and traders are not utilising the facility. When we spoke to a few of them, they said it was because there are no ramps for the pushcarts,” the official said and added that acceptance of skywalks was better than that of underpasses.</p>
      <p>Citizen groups have in the past pointed to the lack of security and absence of CCTVs. The BBMP is also proposing that the underpasses be maintained under public-private partnership. “This would mean allowing advertisements, though perhaps only inside. Discussions are still in the very initial stages and a formal proposal is being fleshed out,” sources said and added that Smart City had given in-principle acceptance to the same.</p>
      <p>Confirming the development, Hephsiba Rani Korlapati, managing director of Smart City, said discussions with BBMP officials had happened. “However, we are yet to receive an official communication,” she said.</p>
