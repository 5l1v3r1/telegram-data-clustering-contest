      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- The United States has the world's highest rate of child detention, and its policy of separating children at the U.S.-Mexico border amounts to "inhuman treatment," a United Nations human rights report said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Attorney <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Manfred_Nowak/?tps=1">Manfred Nowak</a> authored the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights' "<a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRC/StudyChildrenDeprivedLiberty/Pages/Index.aspx">Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty</a>" and said U.S. policy under President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a> to separate migrant children from parents is "absolutely prohibited" by the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
      <p>"I would call it inhuman treatment for both the parents and the children," he said.</p>
      <p>"There are still quite a number of children that are separated from their parents -- and neither the children know where the parents are, nor the parents know where the children are," he added. "So, that is something that definitely should not happen again.</p>
      <p>"I'm also happy that within the United States politics there was a lot of criticism of this inhuman treatment."</p>
      <p>Nowak estimates more than 100,000 migrant children are still being held in U.S. detention centers.</p>
      <p>"That's far more than all the other countries where we have reliable figures."</p>
      <p>Nowak added that the criminal incarceration rate of children in the United States is also very high.</p>
      <p>"It's about 60 [children] out of 100,000," he said. "That is the highest that we could find, followed by others like Bolivia, or Bostwana or Sri Lanka."</p>
      <p>The U.N. report <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/18/780539163/u-n-expert-faults-u-s-for-inhuman-treatment-and-high-incarceration-of-children">coincides with</a> the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Child -- which says child detentions should generally be avoided, used only as a last resort and then only if absolutely necessary "for the shortest possible period of time."</p>
