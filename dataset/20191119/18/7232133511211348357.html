      <p>Fidelity Investments’ crypto-asset division, focused primarily on the market leader Bitcoin, has just been granted a key license by the New York State Department of Financial Services, allowing them to further expand their foray into cryptocurrency and blockchain.</p>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://medium.com/@FidelityDigitalAssets/enabling-institutions-to-access-a-new-medium-for-assets-b9d8329c8766">blog update</a> from Fidelity Digital Assets (FDAS), the NYDFS has just given it a ” limited purpose trust company charter.” This will allow it to launch a platform for cryptocurrency custody and execution “on which institutional investors and individuals can securely store, purchase, sell, and transfer bitcoin” to residents of New York, said the financial regulator.</p>

      <p>This news comes shortly after the chief executive of the financial services giant, which has over $2 trillion under management, said to the Financial Times that her cryptocurrency subsidiary intends to roll out custody to a larger group of Fidelity’s clients. Abigail Johnson <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/18/full-rollout-fidelity-opens-up-bitcoin-business-to-billions/">said at the time</a> that FDAS is “now engaged in a full rollout of its custody and trading services for digital assets.”</p>

      <h3>Good News as Bitcoin Price Flails </h3>
      <p>The news regarding Fidelity’s license comes as the price of BTC has flailed, falling all the way back to $8,000 after surging 42% to $10,500 just weeks ago.</p>
      <p>More likely than not, the approval of Fidelity to launch trading and custody of Bitcoin in New York won’t provide a short-term boon to the cryptocurrency market.</p>
      <p>Just look at the launch of products like the CME futures, which seemingly did not have a material impact on the Bitcoin market for a while because of the slow onboarding process that institutions have to undergo.</p>
      <p>Though, it should be a long-term benefit to the cryptocurrency market.</p>
      <p>CryptoOracle recently hosted a conference call with four industry venture capitalists/investors: Matthew Welsh of <a href="https://www.castleisland.vc/">Castle Island Ventures</a>, Matthew Le Merle of <a href="https://www.blockchaincoinvestors.com/portfolio">Blockchain Coinvestors</a>, Eli Mizroch of <a href="https://www.silvercl.com/">Silver Castle Digital Currency Investment Group</a>, and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/?s=Travis">Travis Kling</a> of <a href="https://www.ikigai.fund/">Ikigai Asset Management.</a></p>
      <p>While these are investors from all over the world with presumably distinct theses, they all centered around similar ideas regarding institutional involvement in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency: they all said that institutional adoption remains a while away, due to immaturity in “three key infrastructure categories”: qualified custody, regulated spot ventures and futures exchanges, and robust data providers at an institutional scale.</p>
      <p>FDAS’ license will help solve the abovementioned issues.</p>
