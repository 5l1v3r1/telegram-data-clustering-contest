      <p>Leaflets falsely linking the Alliance Party in Northern Ireland with the IRA are dangerous, the party has said.</p>
      <p>North Down General Election candidate Stephen Farry said it was the latest stage in a fake news campaign.</p>
      <p>He said: “We are not long into the General Election campaign and yet leaflets, banners, social media posts and other fake news seem to be the dominant narrative so far.</p>
      <p>“Alliance has condemned each of them and we do the same with this. I call on the other candidates running in North Down to also unequivocally condemn these posters.</p>
      <p>“Not only are these posters disingenuous but they are also dangerous, placing myself and other Alliance candidates, as well as our canvassers and supporters, at risk.”</p>
      <p>He said “fake news and gutter politics” was wrong and needed to stop across Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>“We need to get away from this sort of politics and talk about the issues which affect the people in this election.”</p>
