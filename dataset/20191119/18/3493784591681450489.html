      <p><b>THE QUESTION THAT’S BURNING UP THE CAPITOL: </b>Will <b>GORDON SONDLAND</b> plead the fifth at all Wednesday? The president’s ambassador to the EU has already had to amend his testimony once, and subsequent witnesses have testified that Sondland called the president on July 26 from a Kyiv restaurant and discussed “investigations.” Sondland did not mention that in his deposition.</p>
      <p><b>THE ARCS … MUCH OF THIS MORNING’S HEARING</b> has been focused on <b>LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN.</b> <b>DEMOCRATS </b>have positioned <b>VINDMAN</b> as a career military official who called out unusual behavior when he saw it. <b>REPUBLICANS</b> have sharply criticized <b>VINDMAN</b>, suggesting he is a subpar, rogue employee who inflated his role and has been inconsistent in his testimony. They even suggested he was linked to the Ukrainian government.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>A FEW MOMENTS THAT WILL STAND OUT FROM THIS MORNING’S SESSION …</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>DEVIN NUNES</b>, the ranking Republican on the Intel Committee, asked <b>WILLIAMS </b>and <b>VINDMAN</b> if they spoke about the <b>TRUMP/ZELENSKY </b>phone call with anyone in the administration. <b>WILLIAMS</b> said no. <b>VINDMAN</b> said he spoke with George Kent and a member of the intelligence community.</p>
      <p><b>NUNES</b> tried to get <b>VINDMAN</b> to say who he told in the intel community, but he declined.</p>
      <p><b>DEMOCRATS</b> thought it was an attempt to out the whistleblower. <b>VINDMAN</b> said he did not know who the whistleblower was, but would not disclose the person he spoke with. It was a “properly cleared individual” with a need to know, he said.</p>
      <p><b>-- IT’S POSSIBLE</b> for Vindman to not know who the whistleblower is, and not want to say who he told in the intel community, in case that person became the whistleblower.</p>
      <p><b>-- VIRAL MOMENT: NUNES </b>called <b>VINDMAN</b> “Mr. Vindman,” and <b>VINDMAN</b> said, “It’s Lt. Col. Vindman.”</p>
      <p><b>… AND THEN, </b>Republican counsel<b> STEVE CASTOR </b>asked <b>VINDMAN</b> if Ukrainian official <b>OLEKSANDR DANYLYUK </b>asked him to be defense minister of Ukraine. And, in fact, Vindman said yes, three times, he was offered. “I’m an American. I came here when I was a toddler and I immediately dismissed these offers. Did not entertain them.” Vindman said he notified the appropriate counterintelligence officers in the U.S. and his chain of command.</p>
      <p><b>OHIO REP. JIM JORDAN</b> asked <b>VINDMAN </b>why <b>TIM MORRISON,</b> his superior at the NSC,<b> </b>questioned his judgment. <b>VINDMAN </b>read from his employee evaluation, which said “Alex is a top 1% military officer.” <b>VINDMAN</b> said he “never did, never would” leak information. He said that was “preposterous.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>DURING THE DEM QUESTIONING … THE MAIN TAKEAWAYS …</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>-- THE WHITE HOUSE</b> blocked the committee from talking about July 18 call between VP <b>MIKE PENCE</b> and Ukrainian President <b>VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY </b>because it was classified. (Williams previously testified that it was perfunctory.)</p>
      <p><b>-- VINDMAN</b> said that during a bilateral meeting he told <b>ZELENSKY</b> “to be particularly cautious with regards to Russia and its desire to provoke Ukraine,” and “to stay out of U.S. domestic … politics.” He added: “I was passing the same advice consistent with U.S. policy.”</p>
      <p><b>-- VINDMAN</b> reiterated that <b>TRUMP </b>did mention Burisma on the phone with <b>ZELENSKY,</b> even though the transcript did not say it: “This transcript … may have not caught the word Burisma.” He suggested that the transcription software did not pick up the name.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DURING THE GOP QUESTIONING … OTHER MAIN TAKEAWAYS …</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>-- NUNES</b> asked <b>WILLIAMS </b>and<b> VINDMAN</b> if they discussed the July 25 phone call with the press. Both said no.<b> </b>…<b> CASTOR</b> asked <b>VINDMAN </b>if he had ever been told he had been accused of going outside of his lane at work, or accessing information he was not allowed to. Vindman said no.</p>

      <p><b>HOW THE PRESIDENT SEES IT … </b>via pooler Michael Collins of USA Today:<b> TRUMP </b>told reporters at a Cabinet meeting that he had watched some of the morning’s hearing and that Republicans “are absolutely killing it.”</p>
      <p><b>-- ON NANCY PELOSI </b>and <b>USMCA: </b>“In the meantime we can’t get USMCA approved because Nancy Pelosi is grossly incompetent. She’s incompetent, and you’re about to find that out.”</p>

The report cited information from the Defense Intelligence Agency.</p>

      <p><b>THE LATEST IN ISRAEL -- “U.S. gave Benny Gantz a heads up on settlements announcement,” </b>by Barak Ravid of Israel’s Channel 13 news: “Before Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's announcement yesterday on the legality of Israeli settlements, U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman notified Benny Gantz, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political rival, Israeli and U.S. officials tell me.</p>
      <p><b>“Gantz, the leader of the centrist Blue and White party,</b> effectively tied with Netanyahu in Israel's election two months ago. Gantz was asked to form a government after Netanyahu failed to do so, but his mandate expires on Wednesday. There was speculation that the U.S. announcement was timed to help Netanyahu politically. Gantz did not object to the content or timing of the U.S. announcement, according to the officials.” <a href="https://www.axios.com/benny-gantz-trump-israel-settlements-announcement-cb337d1e-bc77-418b-a8b7-8a0aeaaa6f85.html">Axios</a></p>

      <p><b>“Calling the case ‘extraordinary,’ U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols</b> issued an order directing the House to tell Mr. Trump if it plans to request his tax returns from New York state officials.

The two federal Bureau of Prisons employees were expected to appear in United States District Court in Manhattan. …</p>
      <p><b>“The indictment charged the workers,</b> Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, with making false records and conspiring to defraud the United States. Specifically, the indictment said the two workers failed to make their rounds to check on detainees and instead ‘sat at their desk, browsed the internet and moved around the common area.’” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/nyregion/epstein-prison-guards-arrested.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">NYT</a></p>

Marco Rubio, R-Fla., according to a new batch of leaked emails shared with NBC News. …</p>

Under Senator Sessions’ byline? Or under “Breitbart News” byline?’ Boyle asked in a reply. Miller responded that the chart and accompanying article should be run under a Breitbart News byline, in effect disguising his involvement.” <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/stephen-miller-planted-anti-rubio-stories-breitbart-during-2016-campaign-n1085451">NBC</a></p>

      <p><b>CLIMATE FILES -- “As Climate Risk Grows, Cities Test a Tough Strategy: Saying ‘No’ to Developers,” </b>by NYT’s Christopher Flavelle and John Schwartz in Virginia Beach, Va.: “As the Trump administration reverses efforts to fight global warming, local officials around the country are forced to grapple with more intense flooding, hurricanes, wildfires and other disasters. That pressure is colliding with development, which provides jobs, homes and taxes but which also can increase the future risk of disaster as construction spreads into floodplains or forests that are prone to calamity.</p>
      <p><b>“The outcome of that battle will shape Americans’ vulnerability</b> to climate change for generations — and so far, development seems to be prevailing. In many coastal states, homes are going up at the fastest rate in the most flood-prone areas. The number of new houses in what experts call the wildland-urban interface, where the wildfire threat tends to be greatest, increased 41 percent nationwide between 1990 and 2010.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/climate/climate-real-estate-developers.html?action=click&amp;module=News&amp;pgtype=Homepage">NYT</a></p>

      <p><b>FROM DANIEL LIPPMAN: ADVOC8,</b> the D.C.-based event and creative agency, recently trimmed eight jobs from its ranks. One source said the company eliminated those positions as they continue to restructure from a production company to an experiential marketing firm.</p>
      <p><b>ADVOC8’s</b> clients include Facebook, Axios, Google and CNN to produce events in D.C. and outside of the Beltway. Within the last three months, Advoc8, which had $14 million in revenue last year, was named the fastest growing company in D.C. by Inc. Magazine and one of Adweek’s 100 fastest-growing agencies in the world.</p>
      <p><b>ADVOC8</b> said it has “experienced rapid growth, which means constantly evaluating our business model, existing capabilities and skill sets against our growth strategy. As part of that exercise, we’ve restructured several teams to most efficiently align with the company we have grown into, and to stay one step ahead of evolving client needs and industry trends. As we recompose our teams, we’ve eliminated some positions, and added others. The decision to part ways with such talented colleagues is a difficult one, and we are incredibly grateful for their contributions.”</p>
