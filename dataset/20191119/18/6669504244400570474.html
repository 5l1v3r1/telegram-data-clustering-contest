      <p>A 33-year-old man was arrested yesterday after he fled into the woods after police used a spike belt to stop a stolen pickup truck he was driving.</p>
      <p>According to a Vernon North Okanagan RCMP media release, police were alerted to the Six Mile Creek Road area at around 8 a.m. yesterday, Nov. 18, following reports of a stolen pickup truck.</p>
      <p>Police spotted the pickup driving in the area which then attempted to flee from police. A spike belt was used on the truck which continued to drive for a while before the driver abandoned the vehicle and fled into the woods.</p>
      <p>The suspect was then tracked by police with the help of a police dog and the suspect arrested without incident a while later.</p>
      <p>"Our officers did an outstanding job to track down the suspect," Sgt. Justin Thiessen said in the release.</p>
      <p>The RCMP is recommending charges of possession of stolen property obtained by crime and breach of a probation order for the unidentified 33-year-old man arrested.</p>
