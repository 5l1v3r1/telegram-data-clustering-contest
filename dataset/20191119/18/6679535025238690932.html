      <h2>It will help to clear heaps of garbage</h2>

      <p>Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesh said on Tuesday that bio-mining would be taken up to clear heaps of garbage at the solid waste management (SWM) plant at Alevoor here shortly.</p>
      <p>He was speaking after inaugurating the ‘Swachh Nildana – Udupi City Bus Nildana’ (Clean Udupi City Bus) programme here.</p>
      <p>Mr. Jagadeesh said that the district administration was in talks with a Tamil Nadu-based firm for this purpose. This project was expected to cost ₹3 crore and it would be made available under the Swachh Bharat Mission.</p>
      <p>The administration was contemplating a scheme whereby multi-storey apartments and hotels will be told to make their own arrangements to dispose the garbage generated in their premises. “We will provide them with the technical know-how on disposing this garbage,” he said.</p>
      <p>The administration will come up with a programme to keep the government quarters clean so that this could be held as a model to the people in the city.</p>
      <p>“People (living in independent houses) should do composting of the kitchen waste generated in their houses and use it in their gardens,” he said.</p>
      <p>As part of its drive to keep the rural areas clean, the district administration had already given land to over 40 gram panchayats so that they could construct the solid and liquid resource management (SLRM) centres. In about a month, 50 GPs will be provided land for these centres, he said.</p>
      <h3>Pot-hole free city</h3>
      <p>Mr. Jagadeesh said that the administration wanted to make Udupi a “pothole-free city” within a month. For this purpose, Udupi will be divided into four zones. Later it would ask people to give information if there was any pothole, he said.</p>
      <p>He lauded the initiative of the sangha to keep the city bus stand clean. Mr. Jagadeesh suggested holding competitions for cleanliness among all the bus stands in the city.</p>
