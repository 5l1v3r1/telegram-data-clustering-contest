      <p>Philippe Coutinho scored one goal and helped set up another as Brazil beat South Korea 3-0 in a friendly hosted by the United Arab Emirates Tuesday to give the five-time world champion its first win in six games.<br/><br/>Four days after losing 1-0 to rival Argentina in Riyadh, Coutinho started the move that gave Brazil the lead in the ninth minute at the Mohamed bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi.<br/><br/>The Bayern Munich midfielder found Renan Lodi, whose cross was headed home by Lucas Paqueta for his second international goal.<br/><br/>Coutinho then curled home a free kick before the break to double Brazil's lead.<br/><br/>Even without the injured Neymar, Brazil continued to create chances and Danilo added the third goal on the hour mark by drilling a shot past Jo Hyun-woo.<br/><br/>Tottenham forward Son Heung-min was South Korea's most dangerous player but was unable to find a way past Alisson Becker in the Brazil goal.</p>
