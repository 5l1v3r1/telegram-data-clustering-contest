      <p>It seems like <b>'Flavor of Wife' </b>is taking viewer feedback seriously.</p>
      <p>The latest episode of the show broadcasted on November 19th shows the couple, for once, not fighting but working through their problems. </p>
      <p>Although the two people faced major conflict while they tried to cook a pot of stew, instead of fighting, they started supporting each other and displaying healthy behavior. </p>
      <p>Recently, <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/10/netizens-call-out-flavor-of-wife-for-obviously-scripted-situations-regarding-the-ham-so-won-and-jin-hua-couple">netizens have been calling out the show for "obviously scripted situations."</a></p>
      <p>Check out their changed behavior below. </p>
