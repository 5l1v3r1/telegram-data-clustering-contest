      <p>In recent years, female-led blockbusters have been breaking box office records and taking names. Between comic book adaptations <i>Wonder Woman</i>, <i>Captain Marvel</i> to <i>Rogue One</i> or <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i>, high-profile movies starring women at the forefront have finally started to break ground. In light of <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485101/elizabeth-banks-makes-joke-about-charlies-angels-calls-it-a-flop-in-self-deprecating-tweet"><i>Charlie’s Angels</i> big box office flop this weekend</a>, the action-comedy’s writer/director/producer has some blunt thoughts about why those properties have been able to find success with huge audiences. Here’s what Elizabeth Banks said:</p>
      <blockquote>They’ll go and see a comic book movie with Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel because that’s a male genre. So even though those are movies about women, they put them in the context of feeding the larger comic book world, so it’s all about, yes, you’re watching a Wonder Woman movie but we’re setting up three other characters or we’re setting up <i>Justice League</i>.</blockquote>
      <p>Time to rethink every stride in female representation in the past few years? The actress-turned-filmmaker does have an interesting point to make here. She’s attributing the success of movies such as <i>Wonder Woman</i> and <i>Captain Marvel</i> breaking ground due to their ties to larger universes being established. Both movies preceded highly-anticipated team-up movies such as <i>Justice League</i> and <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> – which each prevalently star male heroes.</p>
      <p>The <i>Star Wars</i> franchise has also made a point to heavily feature females at the center of their new stories – between Daisy Ridley’s Rey in the new trilogy or Felicity Jones’ Jyn Erso in <i>Rogue One</i>. But it is <i>Star Wars</i>. Elizabeth Banks’ words to the <a href="https://www.heraldsun.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=HSWEB_WRE170_a&amp;dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.heraldsun.com.au%2Fentertainment%2Felizabeth-banks-charlies-angels-needs-to-be-a-box-office-smash%2Fnews-story%2F6734bbb011c524237b8bd58b54108531&amp;memtype=anonymous&amp;mode=premium&amp;nk=f26522e5243432c54aada676bab114a5-1574185608">Herald Sun</a> challenge a genuine interest in blockbusters starring women. She thinks those movies are successful because they have a “male genre” to lean on. When it comes to <i>Charlie’s Angels</i>, the motivation for a huge audience to buy tickets apparently isn’t there.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Banks has been vocal in recent weeks about her feelings on a Hollywood double standard. She was asked to defend her <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> reboot by <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485025/elizabeth-banks-defends-the-studio-remaking-charlies-angels">reminding fans there’s been “37 Spider-Man movies and you’re not complaining!”</a> <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> has been absent from the big screen for almost 20 years. Banks continued with:</p>
      <blockquote>If this movie doesn’t make money it reinforces a stereotype in Hollywood that men don’t go see women do action movies.</blockquote>
      <p>It should be noted that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484553/charlies-angels-reviews-are-in-heres-what-the-critics-are-saying"><i>Charlie’s Angels</i> wasn’t dismissed by critics</a> (<a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2484492/charlies-angels-review-the-female-centric-origin-story-expertly-adapts-to-the-modern-world">check out our 3.5 review</a>). The movie has a mixed 58% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes and on the moviegoer side it has an 81% audience score and B+ Cinemascore. Oh, and November has been full of flops based on properties in the “male genre”.</p>
      <p>Just look at other recent “flops” <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> or <i>Doctor Sleep</i>. There’s tons of factors that could have gone into <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484986/ford-v-ferrari-box-office-matt-damon-and-christian-bales-new-movie-cruises-to-victory"><i>Charlie’s Angels</i> failure to crack $9 million domestically its first weekend</a>. The season’s stiff competition or the lack of starpower could be a couple reasons <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484987/why-didnt-more-fans-watch-the-new-charlies-angels-movie">why fans didn’t show up in large numbers</a>.</p>
      <p>Remember, just a few years ago the idea of a female-centric blockbuster was somewhat of a dirty word. It was seen as impossible. Movies such as <i>Wonder Woman</i> were the risky shots that were the first to prove it can be done, and an interested audience is there. But, this doesn’t mean the industry has changed overnight.</p>
      <p>Not every big female-centered storyline is going to resonate with the massive audience Diana Prince amassed. The same can be similarly said about two side-by-side male-centered action movies – only there’s far more action heroes already established on the male side. A head start so to say.</p>
