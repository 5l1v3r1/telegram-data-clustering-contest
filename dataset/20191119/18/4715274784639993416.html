      <h1>A remarkable year for Maja Salvador</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:10:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:10</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Peter R. Gonzales</a></address>
      <p><pic src="http://www.manilastandard.net/panel/_files/image/columnists_photos/Joseph_Peter_new.jpg" width="138" height="66"/>It was early this year when <b>Maja Salvador </b>rekindled her romance with young entrepreneur <b>Rambo Nuñez Ortega. </b></p>
      <p>Until now, her relationship with her non-showbiz boyfriend is going strong.</p>
      <p>Also this year, Maja top-billed another hit soap called, <i>The Killer Bride </i>and clinched her first international acting recognition via the Asia Contents Awards in Busan, South Korea for her outstanding work in <i>Wildflower</i></p>
      <p>.</p>
      <p>Given these positive developments, does she feel there’s still something lacking in her life?</p>
      <p>“Well, I dream of becoming a super mom someday. Everyone knows that I come from a broken family. My folks are separated. So, it has been my goal that hopefully, when I already reached the next level and I’m prepared, I hope to become a great mother to my kids and a homemaker in general,” she says.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully by that time, I already know how to take very good care of my own family. I hope that all the love I’ve been receiving at this point, I’ll be able to give back to my dear ones when the time comes. If I already have my own family, I would like them to feel the same amount of love I experience as of now. Actually, the goal is for me to have a complete family in the future. That’s my fervent wish,” she adds.</p>

      <p>The actress is so happy with the presence of beau Rambo in her life at present.</p>
      <p>“He is such a good guy. With him, I found something new to appreciate about life and myself as well. You thought that you already know your life’s direction but here comes an individual who will inspire you more. It’s simply amazing,” she muses.</p>
      <p>“Like when you encounter some difficulties and he’s there to be your shoulder to cry on, ready to give you advice. Not that he would insist you follow what he says. His words serve as balance. At the end of the day, it’s still up to you if you will follow it or not,” she carries on.</p>
      <p>Apart from her boyfriend, Maja reveals that her mom and brother are also a great source of inspiration for her to work hard and realize her aspirations.</p>
      <p>“Of course, they are a huge motivation, too why I’m so focused in honing my craft further. In the first place, you work hard because you want to give them a comfortable life, right? I won’t be here in my present stature and enjoy all these blessings if not for my family. I can’t thank them enough for giving me unconditional love and support which I truly need especially since I’m in the showbiz industry,” she ends.</p>

      <p>Young actress <b>Kisses Delavin </b></p>
      <p>surprised everyone when she recently left Star Magic and inked a contract with Triple A Management and APT Films.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“Actually, it’s a career move,” she says. “I want to explore more, try new things. I want to search more opportunities. But of course, I will always be grateful to ABS-CBN, for everything that I’ve achieved out of my stint with ‘Pinoy Big Brother.’ I wouldn’t reach this stage if not for them.”</p>
      <p>How did she bid her original home studio goodbye?</p>
      <p>“I waited for my contract to officially end. Then, I personally talked to my big bosses in Star Magic and the office staff whom I’ve worked with. I thanked them for taking care of me during the initial stage of my career.”</p>
      <p>Interestingly, <b>Marian Rivera</b></p>
      <p> is instrumental for Kisses’ decision.</p>
      <p>“That’s true! She’s gorgeous. It’s through her why I’ve met Tito <b>Rams David </b></p>
      <p>who heads Triple A Management. We saw each other at the Guillermo Awards and in a fashion show and I instantly felt her genuine caring. I also thought that APT will be a good home ground for me.”</p>
      <p>Since she’s with APT already, it’s very possible that she’ll be doing projects for GMA. If ever, does she have anyone in mind whom she likes to be paired with her?</p>
      <p>“I haven’t met yet all the artists of the Kapuso Network. I’m looking forward to that moment. Let’s see,” Kisses states.</p>
