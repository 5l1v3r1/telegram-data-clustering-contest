      <p>Stephen A. Smith is piping hot mad, but else is new?</p>
      <p>The ‘First Take’ co-host has been under fire for the past few days for his harsh criticism of Colin Kaepernick and his workout on Saturday.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Smith addressed those critics in a two-minute fiery rant:</p>

      <p>“I’m a black man, you idiots!”</p>
      <p>He went on to state that all of his comments were about Kaepernick’s football activities and how he’s dealing with the league, not about his protesting efforts.</p>
      <p>Smith has been one of Kaepnerick’s loudest critics since he found out he moved the venue of the workout from the Falcons practice facility to a local high school an hour away.</p>
      <p>I guess this video should clear things up.</p>
