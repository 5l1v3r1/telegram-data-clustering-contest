      <p>BTS recently took an extended holiday before closing off their Speak Yourself tour in Seoul, South Korea.</p>
      <p>But it turns out these boys just couldn’t rest, as both Suga and Jungkook spent their days off working on new material.</p>
      <p>That’s right, despite their extremely busy year, taking a break is just not an option for the seven-piece, who recently opened up to <a href="https://www.papermag.com/break-the-internet-bts-2641354203.html">Paper Magazine about their time away from the stage.</a></p>
      <p>When chatting to the publication, the boy band were asked what they’d been getting up to.</p>
      <p>‘I slept, worked out and went to art museums quite a lot. I went to Jeju Island, Venice, Vienna and Copenhagen,’ RM said, while V added: ‘I took a good rest. It was an eat-play-sleep routine.’</p>

      <p>But while V was sleeping, Jimin was doing a lot of time thinking – and we don’t blame him!</p>

      <p>‘I just kept on the move and went to a bunch of places,’ he said: ‘It was an opportunity to think about [the group] in the past and in the future.’</p>
      <p>Jin also seemed to have a pretty relaxing time, as he added: ‘I played games at home. I also went fishing with Suga.’</p>
      <p>And even though he enjoyed fishing with his bestie, it seems Suga also managed to put time aside to work on some new tunes.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old said: ‘I focused on resting and worked on some songs. It was a time [for] looking back at myself.’</p>

      <p>And he wasn’t on his own when it came to getting on with other projects, as J-Hope went to film the music video for Chicken Noodle Soup.</p>
      <p>‘I felt and learned a lot of things,’ he said: ‘I can’t call it a rest time, but it was a meaningful time. After that, I came back home, I had good food and rested well. I also played with my puppy.’</p>
      <p>Jungkook kept his answer simple, as he confessed: ‘I worked on music.’</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the 22-year-old was crowned the longest-charting male idol on Billboard World’s Digital Song Sales.</p>
      <p>The star’s smash hit Euphoria re-entered the charts at number 20, setting a new record for BTS’s solo songs with 22 charting weeks.</p>

      <p>And that’s not the only thing as Jungkook has broken into the top five Most Streamed Kpop solo songs of all time, at number four.</p>
