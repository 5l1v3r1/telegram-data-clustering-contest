      <p>Police are searching for the second person to go missing from HMP Sudbury in just two days.</p>
      <p>Jerome Jones, 23, was given day release in Birmingham but failed to return to the prison yesterday, Monday, November 18.</p>
      <p>In May 2018, Jones was convicted for possessing a controlled drug with intent to supply at Swansea Magistrates' Court. He was sentenced to serve four years behind bars.</p>
      <p>Jones, who is believed to be from Birmingham, has been described as being black, 5ft 5ins tall and of a slim build.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/local-news/face-motorist-jailed-after-ignored-3553296">Derbyshire Police</a> have asked members of the public to get in touch if they have any idea where he is, but have also warned the public not to approach him and to report any information to them immediately.</p>
      <p>Anyone who knows where Jones might be is asked to contact police by calling 101. Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously by calling 0800 555 111.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, police revealed that 21-year-old Aiden Morrissey also failed to return to the prison after being given day release on Sunday, November 17.</p>
