      <p>During the summer transfer window, Hazard ended his long-term association with the Blues to sign for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a>.</p>
      <p>However, despite his departure from Stamford Bridge, the Belgium international has acknowledged that he has been left hugely impressed by his former club's progression since the arrival of the ex-midfielder.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>Sky Sports News</i>, Hazard said: "When I watch them, [there is] no Hazard but it is a party.</p>
      <p>"They can score a lot of goals, the fans are happy, they are third in the league, it is going to be a great season. They just need to stay there and win games.</p>
      <p>"We all know <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/willian/"><b>Willian</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jorginho/"><b>Jorginho</b></a> they are very good. Also with the young players coming through, it is great to see the club high and I hope they can stay there."</p>
      <p>When quizzed if he feels like he has missed out on working with Lampard, he added: "Yeah, of course."</p>
      <p>Hazard netted 110 goals from his 352 appearances for Chelsea in all competitions.</p>
