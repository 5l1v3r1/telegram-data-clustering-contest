      <p>A youth had acid thrown on him allegedly by rivals of his family in Ratanpur union of Satkhira’s Kaliganj upazila early yesterday.</p>
      <p>The victim, Rafiqul Islam, 26, is now in a critical condition as about 60 percent of his body, including his face, eyes and head, was burnt, said doctors.</p>
      <p>He is now undergoing treatment at Khulna Medical College Hospital (KMCH).</p>
      <p>The victim’s family members said they had a longstanding rivalry with neighbour Babu Gazi, a member of Ratanpur Union Parishad, over land-related issues and that Babu had long been threatening them in many ways.</p>
      <p>The attack was carried out around 3:30am when Rafiqul went out of his home to use the toilet, said Shafiqul, a cousin of the victim.</p>
      <p>Hearing Rafiqul screaming, family members rushed out of home and saw Babu and his associates Siraj, Tutul and Shaheen on the scene, Shafiqul said.</p>
      <p>The family members chased the attackers, but could not catch them, he said.</p>
      <p>Rafiqul was taken to Satkhira Sadar Hospital and later shifted to KMCH.</p>
      <p>Contacted, Hafiz Ullah, a doctor of Satkhira Sadar Hospital, said the victim was in critical condition as 60 percent of his body was burnt.</p>
      <p>This correspondent could not reach Babu Gazi, despite several attempts, as his mobile phone was switched off.</p>
      <p>Contacted, Delwar Hossain, officer-in-charge of Kaliganj Police Station, said police had visited the spot and found evidence of an acid attack.</p>
