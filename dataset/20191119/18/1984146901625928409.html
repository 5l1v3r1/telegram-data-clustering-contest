      <p>Traders in Newcastle city centre have claimed the council has gone back on its word that Christmas Market stallholders would not provide them with direct competition.</p>
      <p>This year's market is bigger than ever before, with stalls and rides on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/full-list-newcastle-christmas-market-17267723">Northumberland Street, Blackett Street </a>and the immediate area to Greys Monument.</p>
      <p>But despite the market attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors to the city, many traders say they don't reap the benefits.</p>
      <p>A number of business owners told <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/">ChronicleLive </a>that they were told in a meeting with representatives from Newcastle City Council and market operator Mellors Group in September that there would be 'no duplication' with existing retailers.</p>

      <p>Lisa Sample, 49, has ran Matthew's Cheese Shop in the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/grainger-market">Grainger Market</a> for 25 years and is now facing festive competition from no more than five stalls in the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/christmas-market">Christmas Market.</a></p>
      <p>She said: "We are disappointed with the situation. One or two would have been OK but five - it feels like I've been put on the floor and kicked in the teeth.</p>
      <p>"We feel as though we should be OK but these stalls could easily be taking hundreds off us in the coming weeks."</p>
      <p>Her feelings were echoed by Julien Poulalion, owner of La Petite Crêperie, which is closing its indoor premises at the end of the year to focus on pop-ups and events.</p>
      <p>He said: "I'm not criticising the traders here because we all have to make a living. But we were told there would not be 'any duplication' on stalls.</p>
      <p>"But what can we do about it? Last Christmas was my best Christmas ever so I need to hope for the same with it being my last here."</p>
      <p>The decision to extend the festive attractions along Northumberland Street has proved unpopular with renowned street traders.</p>
      <p>Terry Milligan, 70, owner of a fancy goods store on Northumberland Street, has said the Christmas Market is having a significant impact on the stall where he has traded for more than 30 years.</p>

      <p>He said: "We have food stalls either side of us. On Saturday we had queues coming past my stall, blocking potential customers from reaching us.</p>
      <p>"It's incredibly frustrating. We want a Christmas market, just not in this location.</p>
      <p>"The fumes from the charcoal on one food stalls is coming directly over to us so me and my stock start smelling like a bonfire.</p>
      <p>"I am concerned that this is my livelihood. My takings could halve during this Christmas market and I have families to keep."</p>
      <p>Fruit and veg seller Albert Sayers, who last week claimed the festive market could put him out of business, believes the market should have been relocated to accommodate the extra stalls and rides.</p>
      <p>He added: "As I forecast, it is a disaster for us. I shouldn't have to move for a children's roundabout.</p>
      <p>"We have been treated abominally. I am not happy and it is affected my business and my customers.</p>
      <p>"The location of it is completely wrong. It should be in the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/bigg-market">Bigg Market</a> or the Quayside.</p>

      <p>"It is still early days in terms of how it's affecting my business but it's not going to get any better while this market is ongoing."</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-council">Newcastle City Council</a> spokesman said: "The Christmas Market has got off to a great start.</p>
      <p>"While it is too early to make any judgements, we believe the whole of the city centre will benefit from the extra footfall including the Grainger Market.</p>
      <p>"While it is the case that some of the products in the Christmas Market and the Grainger Market may be similar, the Grainger Market has a wide variety of food on offer so there is bound to be some overlap.</p>
      <p>"During the Christmas Market consultation, we encouraged the Grainger Market traders to apply to the market operators if they wanted to be part of the market, but this would be their decision.</p>
      <p>"The council is doing its best to support the traders including investing £3m in the refurbishment of the market building and including the market on a Christmas trail which is part of the Christmas experience."</p>
