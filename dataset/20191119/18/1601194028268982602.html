      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/manchester-united">Manchester United</a> have had a topsy-turvy season thus far and have failed to find their best form. The Red Devils are 7th in the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/epl">Premier League </a>table with 16 points but are closer to the relegation zone than to 4th-placed Manchester City.</p>
      <p>United are 9 points behind the current champions and level on points with Wolverhampton and Bournemouth. They are also just 8 points ahead of Watford and Southampton, who are currently in the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>United midfielder <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/scott-mctominay">Scott McTominay</a>, who has played a vital role for the Red Devils this season, has urged his teammates to step up and start delivering.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/scott-mctominay-convinced-united-will-get-back-on-track">ManUtd.com</a>, McTominay said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>"It's a normal thing to have meetings and for everybody to discuss, that's a normal thing and the sign of a healthy dressing room.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <i>"Boys speaking among it in the changing room, saying what they think we can improve on and what are good ideas as well. There's plenty going on, it's not a place to be quiet and in your shell. It's time for people to really step up and start doing their jobs as well."</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Manchester United travel to Sheffield United on Sunday before making the trip to Astana for their Europa League fixture next Thursday.</p>
