      <h1>George Weston third-quarter results 'a full baguette higher than forecast'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:12:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:12</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>TORONTO -- The parent company of one of Canada's largest grocers outperformed analyst expectations as its third-quarter profit rose while the company works through its multi-year transformation plan.</p>
      <p>George Weston Ltd.'s third-quarter results are "a full baguette higher than forecast," wrote Irene Nattel, an RBC Dominion Securities Inc. analyst, in a note.</p>
      <p>This indicates "that management has finally stabilized the business, with view to growing the current base," she said.</p>
      <p>The retail, bakery and real estate business announced Tuesday that its quarterly profit attributable to common shareholders for the 16 weeks ended Oct. 5 was $69 million or 44 cents per diluted share.</p>
      <p>That compared with a profit of $51 million attributable to common shareholders, or 40 cents per diluted share, in the same quarter last year.</p>
      <p>On an adjusted basis, George Weston says it earned $391 million or $2.54 per diluted common share in its latest quarter, up from $288 million or $2.25 per diluted common share a year ago.</p>
      <p>Analysts on average had expected an adjusted profit of $2.14 per share, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Sales totalled $15.2 billion, up from nearly $14.9 billion.</p>
      <p>"We are pleased with the results for the quarter," said Richard Dufresne, president and chief financial officer at George Weston, during a conference call with analysts after the company released its results.</p>
      <p>Improved performance at Loblaw Companies Ltd., an income tax expense decrease and direct ownership interest in Choice Properties as a result of a reorganization last year mainly drove the profit increase, he said.</p>
      <p>Choice Properties delivered another quarter of strong results, he said, and the company is pleased with positive momentum it's seeing at Weston Foods -- its fresh and frozen bakery division.</p>
      <p>The company is about to complete the second year of a multi-year transformation plan intended to restructure the organization and simplify operations.</p>
      <p>Management is delivering results, said Dufresne, and the team continues to focus on winning new business in growing categories and driving operational efficiencies.</p>
      <p>"There is still lots of work to do, but we are encouraged by our (third-quarter) results as we continue to stabilize the business," he said.</p>
