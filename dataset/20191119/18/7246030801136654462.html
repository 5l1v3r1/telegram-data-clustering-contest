      </p>
      <p>“I admit that I am very moved,” Netanyahu told the council leaders. “We are here, in Gush Etzion, a place we were expelled from in the War of Independence. Here we are on a historic day with another tremendous achievement for the State of Israel, which we have greatly worked for.”</p>
      <p>Netanyahu added that the Trump administration has “corrected an historic injustice and lined up with truth and justice.” He thanked President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and said, “This is a very great day for the State of Israel and an achievement that will stand for generations.”</p>
