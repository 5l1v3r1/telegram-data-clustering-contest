      <h2>Toronto - On Tuesday, Canada’s main stock index eased from a record high hit in the previous session, after a drop in oil prices for the second straight day hit energy stocks.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:33:05+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/user/843083" target="_blank">Karen Graham</a></address>
      <p>Canada's oil and gas sector is already suffering through a period of weak growth, according to the <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/commodities/flat-drilling-activity-in-canada-will-result-in-more-layoffs-amid-low-growth-outlook-for-oil">Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors’ annual activity forecast </a>released a week ago. So hearing the news of the broad-based decline in Canada's main stock index was like a knock-out punch.</p>
      <p>By mid-morning on Tuesday, the S&amp;P/TSX composite index was down 49.87 points or 0.02 percent at 16,975.24. The energy sector subindex dropped 0.7 percent, the most of all the sectors due to a continuing decline of crude oil prices that are dependent on the questionable progress being made on the U.S.-China trade deal, according to <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1XT1OQ">Reuters.</a></p>
      <p>In New York at mid-morning, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 62.51 points at 27,973.71. The S&amp;P 500 index was down 2.28 points at 3,119.75, while the Nasdaq composite was up 12.29 points at 8,562.23, reports <a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/falling-energy-sector-leads-tsx-in-broad-based-decline-as-oil-prices-dip-1.4691793">CTV News Canada.</a></p>
      <p>Looking at the bigger picture, the Canadian energy sector has lost huge amounts of capital after having $30 billion divested in the last three years. This is contrary to the news that global demand for oil will continue to grow, according to <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/oilsands-bailout-money-alberta-ottawa-1.5363218">CBC Canada.</a></p>
      <p>The<a href="http://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2019/november/world-energy-outlook-2019-highlights-deep-disparities-in-the-global-energy-system.html"> international Energy Agency's</a> World Energy Outlook 2019 report, issued this week said that global demand will grow by about one million barrels a day over the next five years, with demand for oil flattening out by the 1930s.</p>
