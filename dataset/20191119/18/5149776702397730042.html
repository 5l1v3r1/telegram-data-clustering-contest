      <p>A Nottingham woman celebrated turning 104 in style as she was taken out for lunch.</p>
      <p>Kathleen Perrin is currently living at the Woodthorpe Manor nursing home, in Woodthorpe, and was taken out for lunch and got her hair done up for her big day.</p>
      <p>Colin Wignall, 59, is a preacher at the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sherwood">Sherwood</a> Methodist Church and has known Ms Perrin since 1998 through the church.</p>
      <p>He took her out for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/">lunch</a> on her special day to the Clock House in Upton.</p>
      <p>She has no immediate family and never had any children, Mr Wignall and Woodthorpe Manor confirmed.</p>

      <p>"She had a lovely day out and drank a lot of tea. She enjoys going out and seeing new places. She has not let anything hold her back," said Colin.</p>
      <p>"She was born in Egypt Road in Basford. Her father fought in the army in France during WW1.</p>
      <p>"She passed a secretarial course and worked at the John Player's offices in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/radford">Radford</a> Boulevard. She's been all around the country, including working in London in the war offices during the Second World War.</p>

      <p>"I first met her at the Sherwood Methodist Church in 1998 where I was preaching.</p>
      <p>"Kath would always clear away the used tea cups after a service all the way up until she was 98. She has been a key pillar in the church community.</p>
      <p>"Her husband David sadly passed away 35 years ago but she has not let that stop her."</p>
