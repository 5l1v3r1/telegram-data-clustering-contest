      <h1>Kenya Moore Confused Some Fans When She Shared A Photo Featuring Marc Daly</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:47:49+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:47</time> by <a rel="author">Ron Collins</a></address>
      <p>Kenya Moore shared a photo featuring Marc Daly and their baby girl, Brooklyn Daly. Kenya has a few people confused because they started to believe that these two are back together.</p>
      <p>But, on the other hand, judging by the fact that Kenya shared the photo on Brookie’s own social media page, this is not so ‘shocking.’</p>
      <p>Still, Marc is baby Brookie’s dad, so it’s not that mind-blowing that Kenya shared a pic of the two of them as some people took it.</p>
      <p>‘Staredown with daddy #miraclebaby #babybrooklyn,’ Kenya captioned her post.</p>

      <p>Someone asked Kenya: ‘Did you tell him you were going to post this picture.😂’</p>
      <p>Another follower said: ‘U deserve this same amount of love from him, not only Brooklyn. Last night’s episode broke my heart more than the news of your separation.’</p>
      <p>One other follower said: ‘I need y’all to make it. You make such a beautiful family. 😊,’ and someone else seemed really excited and posted this: ‘I love this! ❤️ My question was answered indirectly! 😊’</p>
      <p>Someone else asked Kenya this: ‘Just please dont let someone dim ur light girl. U will never truly b happy. Good luck.’</p>
      <p>Another follower posted: ‘👀okay I see the baby looking at Daddy in the face okay they look just like Kenya that baby looks just like her dad he look okay you did it girl you did that job good okay Kenya good morning how are you and the baby I’m just saying hi write me back Kenya.’</p>
