      <h1>Paulo Costa calls UFC middleweight champ Israel Adesanya a ‘P-ssy African’</h1>

      <p>There’s no love lost between Israel Adesanya and Paulo Costa.</p>
      <p>Both men have been at each other’s throats for the past year and were expected to collide in a UFC middleweight title bout in early 2020, but the proposed matchup was cancelled due to ‘Borrachinha’ requiring surgery on his left bicep.</p>
      <p>With Costa shelved until April next year, the Brazilian took out his frustration via social media, calling Adesanya a ‘p-ssy African’ in a now-deleted Tweet.</p>

      <p>“Adesanya is afraid, into himself knows. He try looks good but everybody so skinny and fragile as him fell afraid to fight against powerful guys. P*ssy African!” Costa wrote.</p>

      <p>“I wanna kill only 1 African. That skinny bigmouth,” he posted in a follow-up Tweet.</p>
      <p>Adesanya has yet to respond, but this is shaping up to be one of the most heated rivalries in the middleweight division. Both men sport unblemished records, boast highly entertaining fighting styles and will soon be entering the prime of their athletic careers. On top of that, they hate each other.</p>
      <p>Expect Adesanya vs. Costa to take place after Costa has fully recovered from injury.</p>
