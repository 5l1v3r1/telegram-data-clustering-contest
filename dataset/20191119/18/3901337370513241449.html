      <p>As one of the most popular figures in world football, Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba was spotted chilling alongside one of music's most famous figures during the international break. Check it out!</p>
      <p>The Frenchman has spent the majority of the season so far on the sidelines, having battled with an ankle injury ever since United's 1-1 draw with Arsenal back in September.</p>
      <p>Since then, the 2018 FIFA World Cup winner was spotted undergoing some rigorous warm-weather training in Dubai last month, but remained in a cast until earlier this month.</p>

      <p>Now without his foot brace, the ex-Juventus man was recently seen hanging out with world-renowned music producer Pharrell Williams, as well as NBA star Jimmy Butler.</p>
      <p>It seems like Pogba is well-connected in the music industry, as he has been seen chilling with the likes of Drake, Stormzy, Designer and Jamie Foxx in the past.</p>
