      <p>Illinois state’s attorney Kim Foxx announced on Tuesday that she would be seeking reelection to her seat despite the controversy surrounding her decision to let actor Jussie Smollett off without charges.</p>
      <p>Foxx, 47, tweeted her campaign announcement revealing that she would be running for reelection to her seat as Cook County state’s attorney.</p>
      <p>“I ran for Cook County State’s Attorney four years ago because we needed to change criminal justice in our county,” Foxx tweeted. “Today, I’m officially announcing that I’m running for re-election. We’ve gotten a lot done, and we can’t go back now.”</p>

      <p>Foxx argued that she is “only getting started” and bashed President Trump for his criticisms of Chicago.</p>
      <p>“Four years ago, I ran for state’s attorney to change criminal justice in Cook County. I’m running again because we’re only getting started,” Foxx said. “State’s attorney is a tough job. Every day my office is under attack from a president who uses our city as a punching bag.”</p>
      <p>She slammed Trump and the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police for criticizing her decision to drop the charges against Smollett, but she admitted that she had mishandled the case.</p>
      <p>“They’ll do anything to undercut progress, including attacking me personally over the Jussie Smollett case. The truth is, I didn’t handle it well. I own that. I’m making changes in my office to make sure we do better,” Foxx explained.</p>
      <p>Foxx <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/kim-foxx-told-staff-charges-against-washed-up-celeb-jussie-smollett-were-excessive">dropped charges against Smollett</a></u> as evidence piled up that he had faked a hate crime in Chicago. The <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/judge-grants-chicago-police-department-permission-to-continue-lawsuit-against-jussie-smollett">Chicago Police Department sued Smollett</a></u> to recover the wasted resources drained while investigating the attack described by the <i>Empire</i> actor.</p>
      <p>Trump <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/trump-says-he-asked-federal-authorities-to-review-jussie-smollett-case">requested that federal authorities review</a></u> Foxx’s decision in the Smollett case, saying, “I think that case was an absolute embarrassment to our country. And someone has to at least take a good hard look at it.”</p>
