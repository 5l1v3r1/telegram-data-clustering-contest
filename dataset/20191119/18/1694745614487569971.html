      <p>Kit Harington is moving on from <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Game-of-Thrones"><b>Game of Thrones</b></a>, and one of his first big films <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/kit-harington-quotes-about-game-thrones-season-8-46664460">post-Jon Snow</a> is the star-studded drama <b>The Death and Life of John F. Donovan</b>. Now that the trailer for writer-director Xavier Dolan's film is out, we have a better sense of what's to come.</p>
      <p>Harington plays the titular John, a popular American TV star who seems to have it all â€” fame, fortune, and plenty of love. One of his admirers is young Rupert Turner (<a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Jacob-Tremblay-Interview-About-Good-Boys-Movie-2019-46500387">played by <b>Good Boys</b> alum Jacob Tremblay</a>), a grade-school student struggling with bullying who decides to write a letter to his idol. John unexpectedly returns the letter with one of his own, and the pair begin a surprising correspondence. The film opens with Rupert now grown and John long dead, with the former reflecting about how the letters impacted both of their lives over the years.</p>
      <p>In addition to Harington and Tremblay, the film also stars <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Natalie-Portman">Natalie Portman</a>, Susan Sarandon, Kathy Bates, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Thandie-Newton">Thandie Newton</a>, Emily Hampshire, and Sarah Gadon. Watch the trailer above before it hits theaters on Dec. 13!</p>
