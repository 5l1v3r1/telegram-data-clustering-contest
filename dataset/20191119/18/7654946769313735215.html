      <h1>Brooklyn Nets’ Rodions Kurucs appears in court for domestic violence case</h1>

      <p>Brooklyn Nets forward Rodions Kurucs appeared before a judge on Tuesday morning for a third hearing <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/21/rodions-kurucs-makes-bklyn-court-appearance-in-assault-case/">in his domestic violence case</a> in which he is accused of choking his girlfriend during an argument at the couple’s apartment this past summer.</p>
      <p>The 6-foot-9, Latvia-born baller came to Brooklyn Criminal Court dressed in a dark blue plaid suit with brown leather dress shoes. He was the first defendant called to appear before Brooklyn Criminal Court Judge Kerry Ward, and he seemed to wince as a court officer mangled the pronunciation of his name as he announced it to a full courtroom.</p>
      <p>“Oh, that’s bad,” Kurucs muttered as he stood to walk to the front of the courtroom.</p>
      <p>Alex Spiro, Kurucs lawyer, and a prosecutor discussed with Ward the evidence that has been presented in the case. His side noted that there are no recordings of 911 calls associated with the alleged domestic violence incident, nor are there associated photos or witnesses.</p>
      <p>“Sir, I want to remind you that the order of protection remains in effect … do you understand?” Ward said to Kurucs as the hearing ended.</p>
      <p>“Yes,” he replied.</p>
      <p>Both Spiro and Kurucs declined to comment as they left the courthouse.</p>
      <p>Kurucs is due back in court on Jan. 8 — and is due back on the court at Barclays Center on Wednesday night as the Nets face off against the Charlotte Hornets.</p>
