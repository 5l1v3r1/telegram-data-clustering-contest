      <p>The Warriors’ recent run of success wasn’t the only thing that made Golden State an attractive destination for D’Angelo Russell.</p>
      <p>Russell, who was an All-Star with the Nets last season, said weather was a factor in choosing the Warriors over the Timberwolves as a restricted free agent after going through a New York winter.</p>
      <p>“I thought the opportunity here [in Minnesota] was amazing,” Russell said earlier this month, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/why-did-d-angelo-russell-choose-the-warriors-over-the-timberwolves-start-with-the-weather/564667112/?refresh=true">according to the Star Tribune</a>. “It was definitely something I was considering very strongly. But then when this opportunity came, the weather is way better, so that helped me.”</p>
      <p>Russell, 23, wasn’t going to be able to stay in Brooklyn after the Nets landed Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in big-money deals, and he may not have wanted to stay regardless.</p>
      <p>“I did my first winter in New York and that was tough,” said Russell, who got a four-year, $117 million deal from the Warriors in a sign-and-trade for Durant. “So to get the opportunity to go somewhere where it’s warm again, I think that played a major part in my plan.”</p>
