      <p>President Trump bashed the media on Tuesday for speculating that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/trump-gets-early-checkup-ahead-of-very-busy-2020/">his weekend visit</a> to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was due to major health problems.</p>
      <p>“These people are sick,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting in the White House Tuesday while bringing up coverage of his doctor’s visit.</p>
      <p>“They are sick. We don’t have freedom of the press in this country. We have the opposite. We have a very corrupt media, and I hope they can get their act straight.”</p>
      <p>“I went for a physical on Saturday,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said his trip to Walter Reed was short but included a tour of the hospital and a visit with the family of a “young soldier who was very badly injured who in the operating room.”</p>
      <p>The<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/white-house-releases-statement-on-trumps-surprise-visit-to-walter-reed/"> routine checkup</a> will continue sometime in January, Trump added.</p>
      <p>Once he got back to the White House on Saturday, however, he said he was “greeted with news that, ‘We understand you had a heart attack'” and recalled being asked by his public relations team, “Sir, are you OK?'”</p>
      <p>“I said OK for what?” Trump continued.</p>
