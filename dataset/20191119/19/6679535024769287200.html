      <h1>GHMC proposal to borrow for SRDP gets govt. green signal</h1>
      <h2>₹2,500 crore through term loan will be a shot in the arm for the corporation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:07:39+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:07</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The State government has cleared the decks for the GHMC to explore the option of rupee term loan for progressing with works pertaining to Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP) at various locations in the city.</p>
      <p>The government issued orders on Tuesday endorsing the GHMC standing committee’s resolution to appoint SBI Capital Markets (SBI Caps) as the arranger for raising the rupee term loan of ₹2,500 crore with fee of 0.1%.</p>
      <p>The ₹2,500 crore, if raised successfully, will be a shot in the arm for the corporation, reeling under paucity of funds to take the project ahead. Works have been going on at a very slow pace at locations such as L.B. Nagar and Gachibowli, owing to lack of funds to acquire properties and take the projects to their completion.</p>
      <p>The government had earlier accorded permission to GHMC to borrow ₹1,000 crore through bonds and ₹2,500 crore through rupee term loan, without government guarantee.</p>
      <p>Tenders were called accordingly for the arranger, and SBI Capital Markets won the bid with 0.1% fee for both bonds and loan.</p>
      <p>Since February last year, GHMC has gone thrice to the capital markets and raised a total of ₹495 crore through issue of bonds. After the first two tranches of ₹200 crore and ₹195 crore respectively, it could garner only ₹100 crore in the third tranche during August 2019, owing to depressed market conditions.</p>
      <p>Since rupee term loan links completion of work components with release of funds, the option has been kept at abeyance so far, officials informed. However, the option will now be explored for completion of the ongoing works.</p>
      <p>SBI Caps as arranger, will call for tenders, choose multiple banks depending on the rate of interest and seal the deal on GHMC’s behalf, officials said.</p>
