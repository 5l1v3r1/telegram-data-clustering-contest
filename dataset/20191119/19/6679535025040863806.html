      <h2>Baby Prince still critical, say doctors</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:47:15+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Jyoti-Shelar-3618/" target="_blank">Jyoti Shelar</a></address>
      <p>Twenty-five people, including staff nurses, ward boys, doctors, security guards, and mechanical and electrical supervisors, from KEM Hospital have recorded their statements for the inquiry into the fire that led to the amputation of three-month-old Prince Rajbhar’s arm. The report is likely to be submitted this week.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Dr. Ramesh Bharmal, director of major civic hospitals, who is conducting the inquiry along with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s chief engineer (mechanical and electrical), told <i>The Hindu</i> that he has taken oral as well as written statements of people who witnessed the incident. “Besides jotting down the series of events of the morning, we have also collected details on maintenance of the monitor, cables and other equipment in the ward,” Dr. Bharmal said.</p>
      <p>He said they have faced a slight setback because all the equipment has been seized by the Bhoiwada police for the panchnama.</p>
      <p>Baby Prince was admitted to the hospital’s paediatric intensive care unit for treatment of a congenital heart disease. Around 3 a.m. on November 7, the ECG cable caught fire and caused severe burns to the baby’s left arm, scalp and shoulder. The doctors had to amputate his arm due to loss of blood supply to the tissues. While the baby was already on ventilator support, his condition has worsened with the burns.</p>
      <h3>‘Condition still delicate’</h3>
      <p>On Tuesday, the baby was taken into the operation theatre for a minor procedure of insertion of a central line. “It is often difficult to find veins in such small babies. A central line is thus inserted to administer the drugs and fluids,” said Dr. Mukesh Agarwal, head of paediatrics, KEM Hospital, adding that Prince continues to be on a ventilator. “His condition remains delicate and we are worried about his prolonged dependence on a ventilator.”</p>
      <p>Hospital’s dean Dr. Hemant Deshmukh said abdominal distension has also forced the doctors to reduce the baby’s feeds.</p>
