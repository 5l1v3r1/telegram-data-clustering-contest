      <p>The latest war on Twitter was between Gayathri Raghuram, actor and choreographer, and VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan took a rough turn on Tuesday with reports coming in of the actor’s Twitter account being suspended for violating rules.</p>
      <p>Recently, while speaking at an event in Puducherry about the Supreme Court’s judgment in the Ayodhya case, Mr. Thirumavalavan reportedly made comments about Hindu idols. Several members of the community were incensed by this and some of them preferred police complaints against him for allegedly stoking communal clashes and hurting religious sentiments. Ms. Gayathri also allegedly tweeted disparaging comment about Mr. Thirumavalavan.</p>
      <p>Later Mr. Thirumavalavan reportedly tendered an apology. His party cadres, however, unwilling to let the issue go, demanded Ms. Gayathiri also tender an apology.</p>
      <p>The actor removed her tweet and alleged a few unidentified persons had issued threats on her mobile phone. A few cadres of VCK staged a protest in front of her residence in Nungambakkam on Monday evening. Amidst such charged a atmosphere, she tweeted again challenging the party cadres.</p>
      <p>Alleging that the VCK cadres were openly harassing her, she said she would take the issue to the attention of the National Human Rights Commission.</p>
      <p>Cadres of VCK lodged a fresh complaint against her in the city Police Commissioner’s office in Vepery.</p>
