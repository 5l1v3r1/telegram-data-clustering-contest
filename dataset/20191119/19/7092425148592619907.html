        <b>Mohamed Salah has made his trip back to Liverpool ahead of the weekend's Premier League clash with Crystal Palace.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The forward has been on international duty with Egypt, but played no part in their two scheduled fixtures due to an ongoing ankle injury.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have been sweating over Salah's fitness for the Palace clash after he aggravated his injury during their last match with Man City.</p>
      <p>Salah was seen with ice strapped to his ankle after the clash with City at Anfield just under a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>He then reported for duty with Egypt the following day, allowing Liverpool no time to properly assess the extent of the damage.</p>
      <p>Egypt were hopeful that the 27-year-old would feature in their African Cup of Nations qualifiers against Kenya and Comoros, but he was ruled out and wore a protective boot as a precaution.</p>
      <p>Liverpool physio Richie Partridge flew out to meet Salah and provide some form of treatment, but his rehabilitation has been limited away from the Reds' Melwood training base.</p>
      <p>Salah posted images on his Instagram account of his flight back to the UK, including one of him at the airport, and others showing him playing the Playstation and watching films during the journey.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp revealed previously that Salah was having trouble completely healing himself of the injury, originally sustained at the beginning of last month following a heavy tackle from Leicester's Hamza Choudhury.</p>
      <p>Each time Salah has exercised on the ankle since, Klopp claims there has been a build up of fluid around the joint.</p>
      <p>He now has less than five days to shake off the problem and get match fit in time for the trip to Palace.</p>
      <p>Liverpool face several other injury concerns ahead of Saturday's three o'clock kick-off at Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>Captain Jordan Henderson sat out England's qualifiers with Montenegro and Kosovo due to a viral infection, while Andy Robertson was absent for Scotland having also aggravated an old ankle issue.</p>
      <p>Henderson is expected to be available to Klopp, along with Georginio Wijnaldum - who was also suffering from illness.</p>
      <p>But a decision is still to be made on Robertson, with Liverpool likely to wait until 24 hours prior before making a judgement.</p>
      <p>Joe Gomez is also working to recover from a knock to his knee, and is likely to be involved.</p>
