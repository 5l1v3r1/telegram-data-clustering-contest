      <p>German Federal Foreign Minister Heiko Maas is convinced that now it is time for Russia to fulfill its obligations on Donbas settlement.</p>
      <p>For over five years, people in Ukraine have been separated by war, which took more than 13,000 lives, so this war must be stopped, Maas said at a joint press conference in Kyiv with Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Vadym Prystaiko, an UNIAN correspondent reports.</p>
      <p>"We have the best opportunity in a long time to change something," Maas said.</p>
      <p>The German foreign minister emphasized that after Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president of Ukraine, people got "new hope."</p>
      <p>"Important steps have been taken both in Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote and Petrivske: troops were withdrawn and a bridge is being built. We know that this is all painstaking work, but these changes are very important to people," he said.</p>
      <p>Maas emphasized that the residents of Donbas need ceasefire, while it is also necessary to restore key infrastructure.</p>
      <p>At the same time, in his conviction, time has come for <a href="https://www.unian.info/politics/10760366-kremlin-comments-on-putin-zelensky-meeting-in-paris.html">Russia </a>to fulfill its commitments on Donbas.</p>
      <p>"From our perspective, it's now Russia's turn to implement negotiations," said Maas.</p>
