      <p>RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has convicted 18 people, including government officials and private sector employees, of bribery, fraud and abuse of office, state news agency SPA said on Tuesday, without identifying them.</p>
      <p>The rulings followed an investigation by the public prosecutor, who presented “strong evidence” of corruption, SPA said. Punishments included jail sentences of up to 16 years and monetary fines totaling 4 million riyals ($1.07 million).</p>
      <p>The new head of the kingdom’s anti-corruption commission pledged in August to go after graft by ordinary government employees, following a high-profile campaign two years ago that netted princes, ministers and top businessmen while unsettling some foreign investors.</p>
      <p>The SPA report provided few details about the case in which 18 people were convicted, but said they included an executive-level government official who had received bribes from a businessman, abused his office and participated in fraud.</p>
      <p>The businessman and employees of both men were also netted.</p>
      <p>Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has defended the anti-corruption sweep he led in 2017, calling it “shock therapy”, as he tries to overhaul the Arab world’s largest economy and transform Saudi society.</p>
      <p>Critics said it amounted to a power play and a shakedown of the political rivals of Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler.</p>
