This includes more than a hundred thousand children in immigration-related custody. That violates international law. Worldwide, more than seven million people under the age of eighteen are being held in jails.

      <p>The United States has the highest rate of children in detention centres.</p>
      <p>This includes more than a hundred thousand children in immigration-related custody. That violates international law.</p>
      <p>Worldwide, more than seven million people under the age of eighteen are being held in jails.</p>
      <p>A United Nations study suggests that children should be detained as a measure of last resort and for the shortest time possible.</p>
      <p>Remember, Donald Trump's administration has been criticized for separating children from their parents, especially at the US-Mexico border.</p>
      <p>This is in clear violation of the convention on the rights of the child.</p>
      <p>However, the US has completely denied this accusation.</p>
      <p>At least twenty-nine thousand children mainly linked to Islamic state fighters are held in northern Syria and Iraq.</p>
      <p>Experts suggest that even if children had been child soldiers, they should be mainly treated as victims and not perpetrators.</p>
      <p>They should be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society.</p>
