      <h1>'Remember who we're fighting for,' Singh says as 24 NDP MPs sworn in</h1>

      <p>OTTAWA -- NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says he'll be looking at whether Justin Trudeau changes how he governs, rather than simply who makes it into his cabinet.</p>
      <p>Singh said after meeting with the prime minister last week that Trudeau showed a willingness to work with the NDP on various issues when MPs take their seats in the House of Commons next month for the first time since the federal election.</p>
      <p>Singh showed no signs of that feeling having subsided when he spoke with reporters Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Still, he said the New Democrats would test the limits of Trudeau's talk.</p>
      <p>Singh said he wasn't holding his breadth that the Liberals would agree to everything the NDP is offering, but was willing to find a way for the two parties to work together on common causes.</p>
      <p>Singh and his caucus were sworn in as members of Parliament in a joint ceremony on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>During a speech before the ceremony, Singh said that while he's happy with how the NDP performed in the campaign, he is not satisfied with remaining in fourth place in the House Commons.</p>
      <p>He said he wants to make sure the NDP, which now holds 24 seats, forms government so his party can implement its platform policies and initiatives.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Singh talked about the people his caucus will fight for, including Grassy Narrows First Nation and the children and families at the heart of a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling that ordered Ottawa to compensate Indigenous children wrongly placed in foster care.</p>
      <p>Singh said his caucus will use the minority Parliament to their advantage and will not be afraid to call out those working to protect the interests of wealthy corporations over the interests of everyday Canadians.</p>
