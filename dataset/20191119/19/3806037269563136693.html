      <h2>He also reveals plans for an extensive 2020 tour.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:58:40+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:58</time> by <a rel="author">Patrick Montes</a></address>
      <p>Directly following an appearance on <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/jadasea-half-life-ep-produced-king-krule-stream">Jadasea’s <i>half-life</i> EP</a>, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/king-krule">King Krule</a> is unveiling a new short film and using the piece as a platform to debut four previously-unreleased tracks. Known as <i>Hey World!</i>, Archy Marshall’s latest visual offering comes to us courtesy of close collaborator and director Charlotte Patmore; for the video’s soundtrack, Marshall showcases the new King Krule songs “Perfecto Miserable,” “Energy Fleets,” “(Don’t Let the Dragon) Draag On” and “Alone, Omen 3.” Along with these new sounds and sights, King Krule is also revealing plans for his next major world tour.</p>
      <p>“Photography is my thing. I know how to see that,” Charlotte Patmore previously shared, talking to King Krule architect Archy Marshall for an exclusive exchange for <a href="https://wepresent.wetransfer.com/story/king-krule-charlotte-patmore-cadet-limbo/">WeTransfer</a>. “But with video, there’s so many more people involved and it’s so much bigger. I’m still figuring out what universes I want to create and what I want to be known for, before I do it. I don’t think it needs to be rushed; I don’t think I need to do it for the sake of doing it. It’s really important to me.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of people that don’t see longevity in their careers anymore. A lot of people might release one song and get big off that, and don’t necessarily have an idea of then going forward,” King Krule added during one of his replies to Patmore. “I’ve always held back in putting out too much shit. If you see more longevity, it’ll be good when you die, or some shit. Got a lot of pressure on my death now.”</p>
