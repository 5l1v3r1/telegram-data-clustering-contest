      <p>A six-months pregnant woman was mauled to death by a pack of dogs in a forest in France, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Elisa Pilarski, 29, died Saturday afternoon in the Forest of Retz, about 50 miles northeast of Paris, while taking her own pooch for a walk, <a href="https://www.lunion.fr/id109855/article/2019-11-19/drame-de-la-foret-de-retz-plusieurs-chiens-lorigine-de-la-mort-delisa-pilarski">the French outlet L’union reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Pilarski’s husband went to look for her after she called him about a pack of threatening dogs, officials said. He discovered her dead with bite wounds on her head, arms and legs from multiple dogs.</p>
      <p>An autopsy performed Monday determined that she bled to death from her injuries — and the dogs continued to bite her once she was dead, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Police are investigating whether the dogs were the ones who participated the same day in a local hunt.</p>
