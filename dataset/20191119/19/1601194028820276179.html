      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/liverpool">Liverpool</a> are looking like champions-in-waiting and it seems the rest of the Premier League can only accept their fate. The Reds have been second best in a few of their matches this season, but their single-mindedness and relentless pursuit of excellence have seen them over the line every time.</p>
      <p>This cannot be said of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/manchester-city">Manchester City</a> whose failure to keep to their own extremely high standards may prove fatal for their title defence hopes. Pep Guardiola would have been boiling with rage over how sloppiness in defence has cost the team a lot of precious points and left it trailing Jurgen Klopp’s Reds by eight points.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/leicester-city">Leicester City</a> has continued to justify the praise they have been receiving all season with a string of great performances, and the same goes for Chelsea as well.</p>
      <p>After the cries of doom and gloom that followed the exit of Rafa Benitez, Steve Bruce has steadied the ship at Newcastle United with the Magpies doing way better than expected.</p>
      <h3>Review of Gameweek 12</h3>
      <p>It promised action and excitement, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/premier-league-2019-20-betting-tips-and-predictions-for-gameweek-12">Gameweek 12</a> was all it was advertised to be and more.</p>
      <p>Watford FINALLY got their first win of the season with a 2-0 win at fellow strugglers, Norwich City on Friday.</p>

      <p>Newcastle fought bravely from a goal down to beat Bournemouth 2-1 as Everton secured a narrow 2-1 win over a very poor Southampton side.</p>

      <p>Sunday’s games saw Wolverhampton Wanderers secure a precious 2-1 win over Midland rivals, Aston Villa. Manchester United were emphatic in their 3-1 defeat of Brighton at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>The star match of the weekend saw the clash of the top two as Liverpool solidified their hold on first place with a 3-1 win over a good Manchester City side with goals from Fabinho, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane before Bernardo Silva got a consolation for the defending champions.</p>
