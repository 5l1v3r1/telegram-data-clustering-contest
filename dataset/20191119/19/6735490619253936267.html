      <p>Chuck D is no fan of television exploitation, and the Public Enemy founder made that clear as glass when he took to Twitter on Tuesday to blast daytime TV hosts Maury Povich and Jerry Springer.</p>
      <p>In a tweet he issued on Tuesday, the 59-year-old rapper took aim at the trash-TV icons for exploiting the sad situations of their guests, many of whom are young black people, in order to drum up ratings.</p>

      <p>In fact, he even got a bit conspiratorial to suggest the U.S. federal government is paying the shows to cast black people in a negative light.</p>
      <p>“Just how much the fed$ pay these old white dudes like Maury &amp; Jerry showtiming young folks dysfunctional s**t on Air …especially young blacks,” he tweeted. “Beware of elder media Nucointelpro buzzards hovering. Everything ain’t entertainment in fact it’s exploitation.”</p>
