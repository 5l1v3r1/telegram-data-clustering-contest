      <h1>Cabinet decides to revert to indirect poll for Mayor</h1>
      <h2>Ordinance to be issued shortly</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:36:50+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/T-Ramakrishnan-291/" target="_blank">T. Ramakrishnan</a></address>
      <p>The Tamil Nadu Cabinet, which met on Tuesday, decided to revert to indirect elections to the posts of Mayors of Corporations and chairpersons of municipalities and town panchayats.</p>
      <p>An ordinance to this effect will be issued shortly, government sources said. The decision will have a bearing on 15 Corporations, 121 municipalities and 528 town panchayats.</p>
      <p>Chaired by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Tuesday’s meeting, which was held at the Secretariat, lasted nearly an hour. This was the first official engagement for Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam since his return from a 10-day-long official visit to the United States on Monday night.</p>
      <p>The talk of reversion to indirect elections had been doing the rounds over the last couple of days, and some senior leaders in the ruling AIADMK had sensed it coming.</p>
      <p>One leader said the decision was based on several factors. Legitimate expenditure by candidates can be reduced, as otherwise, contestants for Mayor would have to spend separately, besides the expenditure by contestants for wards. Another reason was that under the indirect system of elections, new alignments of political parties were possible in the post-poll scenario, the leader explained.</p>
      <p>It was only in January 2018 that the government reversed its own decision, taken in mid-2016 when Jayalalithaa was Chief Minister, to have indirect elections to these posts. Early last year, one of the justifications given by the government was that generally, the heads of the urban local bodies (ULBs), if elected indirectly, tended to pay more attention to the development of the divisions/wards from where they got elected, instead of focusing on the entire municipal corporation, municipality or town panchayat.</p>
      <p>In October 1996, when elections for the ULBs took place in the State for the first time, after the enactment of the 74th Constitutional Amendment, the then DMK government preferred the system of direct elections. The explanation given then was that people must have a say in deciding who their Mayor or chairperson should be.</p>
      <p>Chennai got a Mayor after a gap of 23 years, and the DMK’s M.K. Stalin became its first directly-elected Mayor and completed his term in 2001. He got re-elected, but his second innings was cut short due to a change in the law governing the post of Mayor. [Until November 1973, Mayors of the local bodies held the post for only one year, through a rotation of representatives from different segments of society.]</p>
      <p>In 2006, the then DMK regime got the method of election changed to indirect. Five years later, the AIADMK government reverted to direct elections.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Local Administration Minister S.P. Velumani briefed the media about the government’s decision to keep in abeyance the property tax revision that came into force in April 2018, but sidestepped a query on the Cabinet’s decision on the mode of election for the chiefs of the ULBs.</p>
