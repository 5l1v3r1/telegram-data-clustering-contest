      <p>He stated that as a good son of Oshiomhole’s politics, he is following the path of a good father.</p>
      <p>Shaibu stated that Oshiomhole is a respected leader and father he could not have betrayed.</p>
      <p>He also denied allegations that the party leaders in Estako West that signed the vote of no confidence against Oshiomhole were threatened to do so.</p>
      <p>“The Deputy Governor is a gentleman. He could not have threatened or coerced anybody to sign any letter.</p>
      <p>“Those people that signed it are matured men and women that do not feed from the table of the DG,” he added.</p>
