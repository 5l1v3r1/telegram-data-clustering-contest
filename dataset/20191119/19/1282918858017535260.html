      <p>While performing at the launch of HXOUSE, The Weeknd announced the title of his new album. The artist will be releasing his album after a gap of three years since the release of his album, <i>Starboy</i>. He announced that <i>Chapter 6</i> is on its way and the fans are surely going crazy over the rapper’s announcement. He also shared ‘where dreams come true billboard’ which was captioned with, XO. The singer also said that he is going to shift away from the pop content that he has been creating over recent years and return to late-night PBR&amp;B sounds. His previous album was a huge success and its title song <i>Starboy</i> managed to be one of the most viewed music videos on YouTube.</p>
