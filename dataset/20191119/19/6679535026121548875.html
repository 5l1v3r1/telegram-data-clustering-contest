      <p>Prateep V. Philip, IPS, Director General of Police, Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies CID, will receive SKOCH order of merit under two categories.</p>
      <p>Mr. Philip presented two projects under the categories - Community Police - Friends of Police and Smart Policing – Know Your Criminal.</p>
      <h3>Two projects</h3>
      <p>The Friends of Police movement (FOP) which was started in December 1993 by Mr. Philip, was extended to the whole of State of Tamil Nadu by the then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in 1994.</p>
      <p>It has got national and global recognitions. Its main thrust is humanisation and socialisation of the police force.</p>
      <p>Know Your Criminal (KYC), a concept developed by him two years ago, uses tools like Friends of Police, stakeholders, social network analysis and statistical analysis.</p>
      <p>It focuses on 20% of most notorious PDS rice smugglers who contribute 80% of criminal activities, so that they are monitored regularly and preventive and punitive action initiated against them.</p>
      <p>The two projects, out of 1000 nominations in all domains of governance, were recognised for the award of certificates entitled SKOCH Order of Merit<b> </b>and it will be presented the summit to be held on November 29 at New Delhi.</p>
