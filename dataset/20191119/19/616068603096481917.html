      <p>A split Penticton city council provided preliminary approval Tuesday to a large increase in fees it gathers from developers building in the community.</p>
      <p>Council voted 4-3 to increase development cost charges 40 per cent over the next two years to compensate for a lack of change to the charges since 2007.</p>
      <p>“I’m truly frustrated that 12 years have gone by, that's not the development community’s fault, that’s our fault,” said Coun. Judy Sentes.</p>
      <p>Council was split on whether the city should take the proposed increase to the development community before approving them, or push ahead given the long period since the last increase.</p>
      <p>Couns. Sentes, Campbell Watt and Julius Bloomfield argued during a 45-minute debate for a more gradual increase or consultation with developers. </p>
      <p>The first reading was eventually passed with the support of Mayor John Vassilaki and Couns. Katie Robinson, Frank Regehr and Jake Kimberley. </p>
      <p>Kimberley remarked consultation should be undertaken, but predicted developers would just “want zero” increases.</p>
      <p>Money collected through the DCC program is used by the city for roads, sewer, water, stormwater infrastructure and parkland acquisition.</p>
      <p>“The deal here is, these are to provide for projects that are directly related to growth associated with development. If we don’t collect it through the DCCs, we go to the taxpayers,” said Regehr, whose notice of motion earlier this year led to a review of how inflation has impacted developer fees.</p>
      <p>“I just don’t think its fair, going back to the basic taxpayer and saying it's your problem to pick up the difference,” he said.</p>
      <p>The changes will see a developer pay $97,000 in extra fees to the city in 2020 for a 20-lot subdivision. Development cost charges for a commercial building will climb from $4.20 per square foot to $5.88 — a difference of $33,600 for a 20,000-square-foot building.</p>
      <p>Council provided the changes only first reading, meaning the tentative increases will now be brought before the development community for feedback. </p>
      <p>A more fulsome review of the development cost charges program is slated to take place in 2020-21, during which time the city will examine pinning the fees to an inflation index for annual increases.</p>
