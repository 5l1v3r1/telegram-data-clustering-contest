      <h1>Deliberations on IoE status for varsity</h1>

      <p>At its meeting on Tuesday, the State Cabinet deliberated on enabling Anna University to join the Institution of Eminence (IoE) scheme of the Centre.</p>
      <p>Broadly, two decisions needed to be taken. One pertained to the formulation of a law, and the other, the cost, government sources said. As for the proposed law, there are some issues, especially those pertaining to reservation, which require deeper study. That the university cannot have constituent colleges once it gets the IoE status is another aspect to be considered. On the issue of the cost, the total amount required has been estimated at ₹2,500 crore, of which the Centre will provide ₹1,000 crore.</p>
      <p>The government was keen on the university acquiring the IoE status, though it may take some more time to complete the formalities, sources said.</p>
      <p>As part of the efforts to promote industrial investment in T.N., the Cabinet cleared a proposal, mooted by the Cheyyar SEZ Developers, for an additional investment of ₹175 crore, generating employment for 3,000 people. Cheyyar of Tiruvannamalai district is home to a footwear unit.</p>
      <p>The government also gave its approval for an investment of ₹350 crore, made by TVS Motor (Sundaram Clayton) for its unit in Hosur, during 2015-18, sources added. The package of assistance, which should have been provided ahead of the investment, was not granted to the firm due to a ‘communication gap’, which has since been set right.</p>
