        <b>THIS is the callous drug dealer who supplied ecstasy that killed a 16-year-old schoolgirl.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lewis Reid, 22, can be pictured for the first time after admitting selling crystallised MDMA to pals of <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4968210/lewis-reid-chelsea-bruce-codey-robson/">Chelsea Bruce</a>, who collapsed at a party and died after taking a hit.</p>

      <p>Reid now faces a lengthy jail sentence.</p>
      <p>It earlier emerged he injured ex-girlfriend Codey Brown, 18, in a dangerous driving horror seven months before the talented dancer took her own life.</p>
      <p>Kilmarnock Sheriff Court heard harrowing details of Chelsea's last moments after four teens clubbed together to buy ecstasy from the dealer - known as 'Gucci' - in July.</p>
      <p>In social media pictures, Reid flaunted his wealth in a clear nod to his nickname - posing with a £300 Gucci cap and £580 man bag.</p>
      <p>The court heard the dealer - who was not charged with supplying Chelsea - boasted to cops: “I’ve dealt five kilos of this stuff and not one person has died yet.”</p>

      <p>On Monday, prosecutor Ruaraidh Ferguson told how three youngsters including Chelsea took it at a party in Springburn, Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Worried friends said she began to “shake and sweat so much her hair was wet”.</p>
      <p>They took her outside to cool down but she began “gasping for air”, had a fit and passed out.</p>

      <p>She died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.</p>
      <p>Two lads, aged 16 and 18, also taken to hospital, identified Reid as the dealer.</p>
      <p>He warned on Snapchat: “If anyone is saying I sold Chelsea Bruce anything text or Snapchat me.”</p>
      <p>Reid admitted 22 offences between August 2018 and July, including possessing cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine and missing court.</p>
      <p>He also pleaded guilty to dangerous driving after ex-girlfriend Codey Brown broke her wrist when he drove off as she leaned in a car window during a row.</p>
      <p>Tragic Codey was found dead aged 18 seven months later in a Kilmarnock park in March.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Elizabeth McFarlane told the Barlinnie lag, who has revenge porn and drug dealing convictions: “I am considering sending you to the High Court for sentence.</p>
      <p>"I’m not sure my powers are enough.”</p>
