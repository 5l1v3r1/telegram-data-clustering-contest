      <h1>Does Bella Hadid Hate Selena Gomez Over Instagram Drama?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:55:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://collegecandy.com/author/shivanisx17/" target="_blank">Shivani Singh</a></address>
      <p>Last week, <u><a href="http://collegecandy.com/tag/selena-gomez/">Selena Gomez</a></u> commented on Bella Hadid’s picture on Instagram and then Hadid deleted that picture. People were left wondering she was throwing shade at Gomez!</p>
      <p>Gomez commented on Hadid’s post saying “Stunning 😍.” Considering that they both have dated the Weeknd in the past, this was a nice gesture on Gomez’s behalf. Things got awkward after Hadid deleted the post entirely, and fans thought it was because of Gomez.</p>
      <p>A Selena fan account posted the interaction and wrote, “She’s all about supporting women. You all just can’t take it nicely. BTW Ms. Hadid deleted the post,” to which Selena replied, “That sucks 😢.”</p>

      <p>Afterward, Gomez unfollowed Hadid. Hadid never even followed Gomez in the first place. Not too long after, the same Selena Gomez fan account posted a screenshot of an <i>Elle</i> story that covered the Instagram drama. Gomez responded to this as well, “NO. I shouldn’t of [sic] spoken without knowing the truth. I’m sorry. Please don’t be hurtful. She is a wonderful person and it was all a misunderstanding.”</p>

      <p>So that’s all that happened last week. What’s the final verdict? Do the two hate each other now? Nope! According to <i><u><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/18/bella-hadid-selena-gomez-instagram-deletion-no-feud/">TMZ</a></u></i>, Hadid and Gomez had a proper conversation about the deleted post, which means they have cleared up this misunderstanding and there is definitely no hate between the two girls.</p>
      <p>Hadid reportedly took down the post because she did not like the shot. It has nothing to do with Gomez, but Hadid just decided she did not like the photo after she took a second look. She is a model after all. In terms of the Weeknd, both girls are past it and do not hate each other over that either.</p>
      <p>After all of this, Gomez followed Hadid again on Instagram. Yet, Hadid still has not followed her back.</p>
