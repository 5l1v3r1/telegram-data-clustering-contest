      <h3>Some Games are Currently Missing from the Project xCloud Preview</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey</a>, 19 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>Trials for <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xcloud/games">Project xCloud</a> are well underway here in the UK, US, and in South Korea. The preview for the streaming service launched originally back October with just four games, <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Halo-5-Guardians/achievements">Halo 5: Guardians</a>, <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Gears-5/achievements">Gears 5</a>, <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Killer-Instinct/achievements">Killer Instinct</a> and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Sea-of-Thieves/achievements">Sea of Thieves</a>. The list has now expanded to over fifty titles and includes some heavy hitters like <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Forza-Horizon-4/achievements">Forza Horizon 4</a> and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/HITMAN/achievements">Hitman</a>.</p>

      <p>There are also the likes of other big names mentioned in Microsoft's promotional material and listed on its xCloud website such as <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/DayZ/achievements">DayZ</a>, <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance/achievements">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a> and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Dead-by-Daylight/achievements">Dead by Daylight</a>. However, they seem to be absent from the xCloud preview app. In fact, quite a few games are missing from the xCloud app that are included in Microsoft's promotional materials for the preview. The image above shows games like Farming Simulator 17 and Children of Morta that aren't in the preview. Imagine logging on to the xCloud preview, full of anticipation to start a new a career in the farming industry, only to find that the farming simulator isn't actually a part of the preview.</p>
      <p>We have confirmed that the discrepancy between games and marketing material is not down to regional differences — across the US and UK anyway, we can't speak for what's included in South Korea's list of xCloud games, but it's unlikely to be that different from the other two countries'.</p>

      <p>You can view our full list of what games are actually included in the Project xCloud preview <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xcloud/games">here</a>.</p>
      <p>It's possible that these games are being added in as time goes on, although we aren't sure why Microsoft hasn't mentioned this. There are still over 50 games playable in the preview and Project xCloud is still in its very early stages. We have reached out to Microsoft for clarification.<br/><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/tags/XCloud">XCloud<br/></a><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39757/project-xcloud-playable-games#oMessages">View comments <br/></a><pic src="https://static.trueachievements.com/imagestore/0003474100/3474165.jpg" width="64" height="64"/><br/>Written by <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey<br/></a>Hey everyone!
