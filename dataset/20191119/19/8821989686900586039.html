      <h1>Wilco Plot North American Tour for Spring 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:37:26+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:37</time> by <a rel="author">Ryan Reed</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/wilco/">Wilco</a> announced a North American tour for spring 2020. The 17-date leg kicks off March 9 in Madison, Wis., and wraps April 5 in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Tickets go on sale Nov. 22 at 10AM local time via the band's <a href="https://wilcoworld.net/shows/">website</a>. The newly announced dates follow the alt-rock act's ongoing fall trek, which continues Nov. 20 in Omaha, Neb., and runs through Jan. 25 in Mexico City; their hand-curated festival vacation event, <a href="https://wilcoskybluesky.com/">Sky Blue Sky</a>, takes place Jan. 18 through 22.</p>
      <p>The concerts promote Wilco's recently issued 11th LP, <i><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/wilco-ode-to-joy-album-review/">Ode to Joy</a></i>, which features lead single <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/wilco-ode-to-joy/">"Love Is Everywhere (Beware)."</a> The sextet paired the tour announcement with an intimate video for that album's "Before Us"; in the black-and-white clip, director Zoran Orlic follows the band at their Chicago studio the Loft as they track the sparse, simmering folk-rock cut.</p>

      <h3>Wilco Albums Ranked</h3>

      <h4>12. 'Mermaid Avenue Vol. II' (With Billy Bragg) (2000)</h4>
      <p>Wilco and British singer-songwriter Billy Bragg recorded so many songs for their 1998 collaboration 'Mermaid Avenue' that they had enough left over for another album (and, later, a box set collecting both volumes plus more outtakes). Like the original LP, 'Vol. II' puts some unpublished words by late folksinger Woody Guthrie to new music written by Wilco and Bragg. The first album is a blast; this follow-up is less so. It often sounds like a bunch of leftovers for the most part, with a few inspired moments showing up here and there. Not terrible, but not all that exciting either.</p>

      <h4>11. 'A.M.' (1995)</h4>
      <p>Fresh from Uncle Tupelo's breakup, Jeff Tweedy made an album with his new band that sounded an awful lot like his old one. 'A.M.' is Wilco's only strictly alt-country album and, in hindsight, is the only one that really sounds shackled. From here on out, it was one creative step after another as they turned into one of the '00s' best bands. But here they're pretty much going through the motions. There are some good songs – "I Must Be High" and "Box Full of Letters," especially – but not much points to the leap they'd make in just a few short years on the sonic playgrounds of 'Summerteeth.'</p>

      <h4>10. 'Schmilco' (2016)</h4>
      <p>Released just a year after 'Star Wars,' 'Schmilco' often sounds like it was hastily put together. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing: The songs here mostly jump from one spot to the next with little effort. Without the sonic architecture that serves as the foundation of so many of their albums, Wilco almost relish the freedom here to play it looser and with more passion than their more aurally adventurous records can stifle. Still, those meticulously constructed soundscapes also hide songs' occasional shortcomings.</p>

      <h4>9. 'Star Wars' (2015)</h4>
      <p>At 33 minutes, Wilco's ninth album doesn't have much time to sink into some of the excesses that can weigh down past works. If the album's title doesn't tip you off that 'Star Wars' is Wilco at their most relaxed, the cover artwork drives home the point. It feels a little slight – as does its follow-up 'Schmilco,' which comes from the same sessions – but without much clutter getting in the way of the songs, the relatively straightforward nature of the album almost sounds like a revelation among everything that's come before it.</p>

      <h4>8. 'Wilco (The Album)' (2009)</h4>
      <p>The album title and opening track "Wilco (The Song)" pretty much sum up the group's seventh LP: It's Wilco being Wilco. In a way, 'Wilco (The Album)' may be their most representative record – a little bit moody, lots of cool sounds playing around in the corners and nearly impenetrable on the first few listens. But give it time and the album reveals itself to be one of the least fussy in Wilco's post-'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' catalog. It also serves as a bridge between the 'YHF' period wrapped up on 2007's 'Sky Blue Sky' and the new era starting with 2011's 'The Whole Love.'</p>

      <h4>7. 'The Whole Love' (2011)</h4>
      <p>Firmly set in their ways by their eighth album, Wilco don't throw any curveballs on 'The Whole Love,' delivering a workmanlike LP that, once again, reveals way more than you expect on repeated listens. This is the band's first record on its own label, but it's no occasion for breaking down rules or experimenting. They'd already been doing that for more than a decade at this point anyway. If anything, 'The Whole Love' may be Wilco's most accessible album since 'Summerteeth.' It would be four years before Wilco released their next album, though Jeff Tweedy made a record with his son during the break.</p>

      <h4>6. 'Sky Blue Sky' (2007)</h4>
      <p>The band's sixth album is the one where it all starts to settle into a groove. In some ways, it doesn't sound all that different from the records that came before and after it. But with the additions of Nels Cline and Pat Sansone, Wilco enter a new phase that opens up their worldview even more. The songs on 'Sky Blue Sky' don't stand out as much as they did on past albums, and there's a sense of familiarity here that would increase with subsequent records. Still, the corners offer revelations that aren't always apparent on the surface. A deeper listen than it initially lets on.</p>

      <h4>5. 'Mermaid Avenue' (With Billy Bragg) (1998)</h4>
      <p>Between their second and third albums, Wilco recorded a bunch of songs with singer-songwriter Billy Bragg based on lyrics left behind by Woody Guthrie. Wilco and Bragg wrote new music for the project, with Bragg and Jeff Tweedy alternating lead vocals. The best songs ended up on this initial 1998 volume (a second edition including outtakes followed in 2000, with a box set featuring even more of the sessions arriving in 2012). It's a detour for the band, which was moving on to the next stage of its career with the expansive 'Summerteeth,' but also a breezy throwback to its folk roots.</p>

      <h4>4. 'A Ghost Is Born' (2004)</h4>
      <p>The follow-up to the majestic 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' pushes the multi-textured soundscapes of its predecessor further out there. The tracks are more like art sculptures than traditional songs, and the otherworldly rattles and hums are even more pronounced this time around. It's challenging but also rewarding. It's also an uncompromising vision of a band that seemed on the brink of extinction just a few years earlier. 'A Ghost Is Born' marks the first Wilco album to truly abandon any concessions to mainstream appeal, and a path to their legacy as one of the 21st century's best bands.</p>

      <h4>3. 'Being There' (1996)</h4>
      <p>After the debut's picking-up-the-pieces set of alt-country castaways that didn't sound too far removed from Jeff Tweedy's Uncle Tupelo past, he re-imagined Wilco as a more adventurous band for the follow-up. With multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett at his side for the first time, Tweedy crafted a double-album milestone that wrapped those alt-country sounds in new shades and textures. The highlight is the six-and-a-half-minute opener "Misunderstood," a slow-burning freak-out that pointed to the band's future. The rest of it steers from alt-rock and pop to psychedelia and jam-band excess.</p>

      <h4>2. 'Summerteeth' (1999)</h4>
      <p>The first mind-bending Wilco album arrived between their Woody Guthrie project with Billy Bragg and the career-defining masterpiece 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot," but sounds little like either of those records. Holed up in the studio with Jay Bennett, the band's other MVP (who was fired in 2001 and died in 2009), Jeff Tweedy assembled a cotton candy-colored work that had nothing to do with their alt-country past. Strings, horns and synths push the songs into more melodic territory, with nods toward sunshine-pop nostalgia. It's the creative impetus Wilco needed to take them to the next stage.</p>

      <h4>1. 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' (2002)</h4>
      <p>Wilco's fourth album was all ready to go during the last half of 2001 when their record company rejected it. In April 2002, the album found a new home – and new resonance. The events of 9/11 had shaped the songs on 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' into something bigger than Jeff Tweedy – who was struggling with Wilco's other creative force, Jay Bennett, during production – had envisioned. The album became a cornerstone work of 9/11 and the band's masterpiece. From here on out, the sonic textures that define 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' would guide Wilco's albums. A milestone work of the 21st century.</p>
