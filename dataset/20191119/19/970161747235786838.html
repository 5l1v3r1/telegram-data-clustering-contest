      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-big-bang-theory/">The Big Bang Theory</a> creator Chuck Lorre has asked an unlikely source to help with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/young-sheldon/">Young Sheldon</a>’s falling ratings (although we are pretty sure he’s joking).</p>
      <p>The spin-off show has been successful in its own right, yet it has still failed to match the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/16/big-bang-theorys-chuck-lorre-broke-tears-writing-series-finale-9563741/">high ratings of The Big Bang Theory, which ended in May this year.</a></p>
      <p>Chuck recently joked that he wished Russia would hack the Nielsen ratings to make Young Sheldon and his other show Mom’s viewership look a little better.</p>
      <p>At the end of each of his programs, the show creator is allowed one second to display a vanity card (a card which allows him to say anything he wants).</p>
      <p>With this week’s instalment, he joked about the falling ratings of both of his hit TV shows.</p>
      <p>The card read: ‘Russia, if you’re reading this, hack into the Nielsen computers and make our ratings higher.’</p>

      <p>The news follows after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/young-sheldon/">Young Sheldon</a> was faced with a $272,000 (£219,000) for using an emergency alert tone sound effect.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The series, which focuses on the growing pains and family life of a young Sheldon Cooper, used an altered version of the Emergency Alert System tone which has been banned in the US from being used outside of legitimate emergencies.</p>

      <p>As a result, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) wants to slap a fine on the show for not adapting the sound enough to be not considered the actual alert.</p>
      <p>They stated: ‘On April 12, 2018, CBS transmitted an episode of Young Sheldon via at least 227 television stations, including 15 of CBS’s owned-and-operated television stations.</p>
      <p>‘The episode included a sound effect accompanying a tornado warning, which the producers modified, but still audibly resembled actual EAS tones.’</p>
