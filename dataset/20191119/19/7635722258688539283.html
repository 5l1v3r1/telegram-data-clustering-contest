        <b>Tottenham have confirmed Mauricio Pochettino's exit as manager.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Spurs have endured a difficult start to the 2019-20 campaign after reaching last season's Champions League final.</p>
      <p>The club languish in 14th in the Premier League, winning just three games in 12.</p>
      <p>But despite making Tottenham a fixture in the Top Four and Champions League, the club have decided to sack Pochettino and his staff.</p>
      <h3>Statement</h3>
      <p><i>"The club can today announce that Mauricio Pochettino and his coaching staff Jesus Perez, Miguel D’Agostino and Antoni Jimenez have been relieved of their duties,"</i> he said.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"Chairman, Daniel Levy, said: 'We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"'Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"'It falls to the Board to make the difficult decisions - this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff - but we do so in the Club's best interests.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"'Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history. I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us. I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"'We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters.'"</i>
      </p>
      <p>The club also added:<i> "We shall provide an update on new coaching staff in due course."</i></p>
      <p>Their last league matches saw them<a href="https://www.offtheball.com/soccer/everton-v-tottenham-dele-alli-921231"><b> draw 1-1 at Everton</b></a> and Sheffield United which marked five league games without a win. Spurs' most recent league win came against Pochettino's former club Southampton on September 28th.</p>
      <p>Tottenham return to action on Saturday against West Ham in the Premier League.</p>
      <h3>Factors</h3>
      <p><i>The Telegraph</i> had reported earlier on Tuesday that Levy and Pochettino had <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/sport/pochettino-holds-crisis-talks-tottenham-chairman-daniel-levy-926578"><b>held crisis talks</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Pochettino's apparent frustration with Spurs' transfer strategy had been apparent over recent seasons, but especially this summer.</p>
      <p>The Argentine coach had hoped to refresh his squad. But "nobody wanted the players he wanted to get rid of" <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/sport/stalled-goodbyes-tottenham-908425"><b>according to</b></a> <i>The Sun</i>'s chief sports reporter Martin Lipton.</p>
