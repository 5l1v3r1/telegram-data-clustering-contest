      <p><b>PARIS —</b> It is the closest that anyone outside the super rich is ever likely to get to owning a painting by Picasso.<br/><br/>A canvas by the Spanish master worth more than one million euros ($1.1 million) is to be raffled off for charity.<br/><br/>Anyone buying a 100-euro ticket in the international draw has a one-in-200,000 chance of winning a still life of a stylized glass of absinthe and a newspaper Picasso created in 1921.<br/><br/>The draw, whose proceeds will go to the charity CARE to combat poverty in Africa, was launched at the Picasso Museum in Paris Tuesday.<br/><br/>The last time the organizers held one, six years ago, Picasso's "Man with Opera Hat" was won by a 25-year-old Pittsburgh fire safety official, Jeffrey Gonano, who was looking for something to decorate his home.<br/><br/>The five million euros raised went to help preserve ancient city of Tyre in Lebanon.<br/><br/>"Art and charity usually come together at gala dinners, where a few (wealthy) people fork out millionaire sums for a painting," said Peri Cochin, the French television producer behind the draw.<br/><br/>She hopes to raise up to 19 million euros for CARE from the new raffle: 50,000 people — mostly from the US, Britain, Mexico and Brazil — took part in the last draw.<br/><br/>The painting this time comes from the billionaire Lebanese-born collector David Nahmad, who has one of the biggest private collection of Picassos in the world.<br/><br/>He will get one million euros from the draw with the rest going to the charity.<br/><br/>Picasso Museum director Laurent Le Bon said the painting comes from a period when Picasso "synthesized the realist and cubist currents" of his work.<br/><br/>It is a painting "that makes people think and dream", he said.<br/><br/>The draw, which is being run through the 1picasso100euros.com website, will take place in Paris on Jan. 6. — AFP</p>
