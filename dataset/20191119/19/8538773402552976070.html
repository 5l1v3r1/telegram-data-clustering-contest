      <p>Tottenham have sacked Mauricio Pochettino as manager, the Premier League club announced on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste," Spurs chairman Daniel Levy said it a team statement.</p>
      <p>"Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>
      <p>"It falls to the Board to make the difficult decisions -- this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff -- but we do so in the Club's best interests."</p>
      <p>The Argentine coach moved to Spurs from Southampton in May of 2014.</p>
      <p>He led the London club to the final of the UEFA Champions League last season, where they fell to 2-0 Liverpool in Madrid.</p>
