      <h1>Police launch ‘Girijana Mitra’ in tribal hamlets of E.G. district</h1>
      <h2>Senior police officers interact with Koya, Gottikoya tribes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:38:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Rajulapudi-Srinivas-339/" target="_blank">Rajulapudi Srinivas</a></address>
      <p>Police have launched a programme called ‘Girijana Mitra’ in the Agency area of the district to improve coordination with the tribals and help improve their quality of life.</p>
      <p>Through the programme, police personnel will reach out to residents of Maoist-dominated villages and interact with them on a regular basis to identify problems faced by women, youth and children living in the hamlets.</p>
      <p>Superintendent of Police (SP) Adnan Nayeem Asmi launched the ‘Girijana Mitra’ programme at Gurthedu village in Y. Ramavaram mandal under Rampachodavaram police sub-division limits and interacted with the tribals.</p>
      <p>Later, Mr. Nayeem inaugurated a volleyball tournament in the village. More than 90 teams from the Agency areas in East Godavari district participated in the tournament, said Rampachodavaram Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Vakul Jindal.</p>
      <p>“As part of ‘Girijana Mitra’, police will visit villages, organise meetings and ask the tribals about their problems. Issues such as health, education, drinking water, roads, implementation of various government schemes, extremism, malnutrition and other topics would be discussed during the programme,” Mr. Nayeem said.</p>
      <p>Many Koya, Gottikoya, Gond and other migrated tribes are living in the Agency areas in the district. They depend on ‘podu agriculture’, hunting and fishing while a few groups eke out their livelihood by collecting forest produce.</p>
      <p>However, due to marginal development and lack of awareness, some tribals are being lured by the Maoists to join their fold and others being roped in by ganja smugglers, police said.</p>
      <p>“We will organise sports, cultural events and medical camps in the hamlets and distribute medicines, clothes, books, blankets and sports kits during ‘Girijana Mitra’, About 2,000 youths participated in the tournaments at Gurthedu,” said Mr. Jindal.</p>
      <p>Yetapaka ASP Amit Bardar, who arranged a similar programme at Amadalapadu tribal village in Chinturu division recently, said that the ‘Girijana Mitra’ programme will help prevent tribals from joining the Maoists.</p>
      <p>Mr. Nayeem said that ‘Girijana Mitra’ will help the police develop a bond with the tribes. “We will sensitise people living in remote hamlets about health education, outbreak of viral fevers, improve communication and provide them better infrastructure in the border villages,” Mr. Nayeem said.</p>
