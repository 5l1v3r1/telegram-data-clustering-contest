      <h2>‘Petitioner must get chance to gather evidence to prove claim of improper acceptance of nomination’</h2>

      <p>The Madras High Court on Tuesday dismissed an application preferred by Thoothukudi Member of Parliament Kanimozhi and refused to reject an election petition filed by a voter from her constituency, challenging her victory in May this year on the ground of having reportedly not disclosed certain details while submitting her nomination papers.</p>
      <p>Justice S.M. Subramaniam said that he did not find any reason to reject the plaint, since the correctness or otherwise of the grounds on which the election petition had been filed could be tested only after a full fledged trial.</p>
      <p>The judge was of the view that the election petitioner must be given a chance to marshal evidence to prove his claim of improper acceptance of nomination.</p>
      <p>In a detailed affidavit filed in support of her application to reject the plaint, Ms. Kanimozhi stated that the election petitioner’s averments were vague and bereft of material facts.</p>
      <p>She pointed out that one of the grounds for challenging her election was alleged failure to mention her husband’s Permanent Account Number (PAN) in her affidavit disclosing family assets.</p>
      <h3>Not applicable</h3>
      <p>Asserting that her husband, a resident of Singapore, neither possesses a PAN card nor does he pay any income tax in that country, since he does not have any taxable income, she claimed to have rightly mentioned the words ‘not applicable’ in the column meant for filling up his PAN number in her election affidavit.</p>
      <p>Further, stating that her nomination was accepted by the Returning Officer after complete scrutiny and she had won by a huge margin of 3,47,209 votes against her nearest rival Tamilisai Soundararajan (now Governor of Telangana) of Bharatiya Janata Party, the MP said that she had indeed secured 5,63,143 votes in total.</p>
      <p>She urged the court to reject the election petition at the initial stage itself without letting her undergo the rigours of a protracted trial on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations.</p>
      <p>However, not convinced with her submissions, Justice Subramaniam insisted that the election petition should necessarily be taken to its logical end.</p>
      <p>After he pronounced orders on Tuesday, it was brought to the notice of the judge that the Election Commission of India too had filed a couple of applications, one for deleting the Chief Election Commissioner from the list of respondents and another for releasing the electronic voting machines used in Thoothukudi constituency.</p>
      <p>Since there was no dispute with respect to the number of votes cast in the election, the ECI urged the court to order the release of the EVMs so that they could be used for other elections. The judge said that a decision on the two applications shall be taken on November 27 when another election petition against Ms. Kanimozhi was scheduled to be taken up for hearing.</p>
      <p>The other petition had originally been filed by Ms. Soundararajan, who chose to withdraw it after assuming the office of Governor.</p>
      <p>After the withdrawal, a BJP member A. Muthuramalingam got himself substituted in her place and decided to pursue the election petition filed on various grounds including alleged bribing of voters.</p>
