      <p>The Tamil Nadu Drugs Control Department has instructed all its assistant directors in the State to ensure that pharmaceutical manufacturers adhere to rules for safe disposal of expired drugs.</p>
      <p>The instruction comes after heaps of expired drugs were found dumped near the service lane of the Vandalur-Minjur Outer Ring Road near Nazarathpettai.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, a team from the Drugs Control Department inspected the spot where strips of tablets and syrup bottles were dumped a few days ago. <i>The Hindu</i> had published an image on November 19 in these columns, showing the dump of medicines.</p>
      <p>K. Sivabalan, Director of Drugs Control, said they tracked the manufacturer of the disposed drugs and were investigating the incident.</p>
      <p>“Date expired drugs and physician samples, along with food supplements, were found dumped at the site. The clearing and forwarding agent had engaged a lorry to transport the drugs to the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board’s (PCB) incinerator near Maraimalai Nagar, but the driver dumped the drugs on the roadside,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Department has instructed the agent to remove the items from the spot and incinerate the drugs, he said, adding: “As per the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, clearing and forwarding agents should withdraw unsold stock of drugs from the market. The stock should be taken to the manufacturing facility for destruction or PCB incinerator. It should be disposed of as per PCB norms and Biomedical Waste Management Rules, and records should be maintained for the same.”</p>
      <p>The department has sent reminders to all assistant directors to ensure that pharmaceutical manufacturers follow the existing norms for disposing of the stock.</p>
      <p>“We have asked clearing and forwarding agents and manufacturers to strictly follow instructions. Failure to do so will invite action,” he said.</p>
