      <p>The State government should give up its moves to sell Andhra University lands in the name of ‘Build AP Mission’, CPI(M) Greater Visakha City Committee has demanded.</p>
      <p>The Jagan Mohan Reddy government would have to face the wrath of the people, if it does not give up its plans to sell Andhra University lands to raise funds for the implementation if its pet projects like ‘Navaratnalu’ and ‘Naadu – Nedu’ schemes, party city committee secretary B. Ganga Rao said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>He noted that the government was said to have already identified 100 acres of university land for sale. During the tenure of Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, 3,000 acres of land was sold in Visakhapatnam and ₹3,000 crore was credited to the State treasury. Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (VUDA) was converted into a real estate agency, he alleged.</p>
      <p>The Chandrababu Naidu government had also planned to privatise 60 acres of Andhra University land but gave up following stiff resistance from the public. An unsuccessful attempt was made to sell 35 acres of GVMC lands.</p>
      <p>Now, the Jagan Mohan Reddy government was planning to sell government lands in Visakhapatnam and to cause loss to the district, he alleges.</p>
