      <h1>Brendan Rodgers emerges as Tottenham contender after Mauricio Pochettino is sacked</h1>
      <h2>The former Southampton boss was sacked after a poor run of the form that has saw no win in five.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:52:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:52</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino has been sacked as manager of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> after a poor start to the season - leaving former Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers on high alert.</p>
      <p>Spurs currently sit 14th in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/english-premier-league">Premier League,</a> six points above the relegation zone having won just three games in the league.</p>
      <p>The club haven't won in their last five and have also suffered in Europe with a heavy 7-2 defeat to Bayern Munich earlier in this campaign.</p>
      <p>The decision has left <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> as one of the favourites for the job. The former Celtic boss has turned Leicester City into one of the league's top sides since making the move back to England in February.</p>
      <p>Pochettino's time at the club has been a success overall since he moved from Southampton in 2014.</p>

      <p>He guided them to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/champions-league">Champions League</a> Final last season before defeat to Liverpool but the Argentinian has failed to win a trophy in North London.</p>
      <p>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy said: "We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the board has taken lightly, nor in haste.</p>
      <p>“Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>
      <p>“It falls to the board to make the difficult decisions - this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff - but we do so in the Club's best interests.</p>
      <p>“Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history. I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us. I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here.</p>
      <p>“We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters.”</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old has regularly been linked with moves away from the club during his time, with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> reportedly interested in taking him after Jose Mourinho left the club.</p>
