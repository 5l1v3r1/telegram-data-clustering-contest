        <i>I'm a serial lipstick dater. So many lip products slide onto my desk. Some I double-tap and have all the heart eyes for.

        <b>THE DETAILS: </b>
      </p>
      <p>If you're equal parts bougie and badass (it me), it'll be hard for you to pass up this fire-red, studded lipstick bullet. Once you get over the gorgeous packaging, which is a Nordstrom exclusive I peeped at its New York store opening a few weeks ago, you'll enjoy how <b>this satin texture boasts the most beautifully pigmented finish</b> in just one glide. </p>
      <p>
        <b>WHY I'M OBSESSED:</b>
      </p>
      <p>I'm in a gifty mood because it's the holidays and this is the prettiest little present. Except, um, I'm keeping it for myself. Besides the bottle being super hawt, the shade is also super hawt. It's<b> a blue-based cherry color,</b> which means it looks incredible on your skin tone and your friends' skin tones. Go ahead, gift yourself this chic lipstick because you know you want to.  </p>

      <p>
        <b>THE DETAILS: </b>
      </p>
      <p>In a world full of lip glosses, what makes you need a new one? Well, I bet you don't have a light-reflecting, iridescent pearl-packed gloss that makes you look like the coolest witch alive. Thought so. Plus, this fun one is made with<b> hyaluronic filling spheres,</b> which naturally plump up your lips. </p>
      <p>
        <b>WHY I'M OBSESSED:</b>
      </p>
      <p>I know, I know—this purple gloss looks like what your middle school dreams were made of. But I ask that you trust my 27-year-old judgement would not steer you wrong when it comes to beauty. Actually, the purple packaging is a bit deceiving because it's more of a <b>translucent, mauve shade that reads like a mysterious hybrid of gray and plum with brown undertones</b>. It's quite mystical and makes me feel like an ethereal diva. It's getting me through retrograde. </p>

      <p>Blue Lagoon Iceland bluelagoon.com<br/>$37.00 <br/><a href="https://shop-usa.bluelagoon.com/products/lip-balm">SHOP IT</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>THE DETAILS: </b>
      </p>
      <p>Every season, we all forget what winter feels like. It's suddenly surprising and downright rude that the second we walk outside our lips are literally going to crack, shrivel, and fall tf off. Okay, that may be a bit dramatic (except if you live in New York), but what isn't is that it's impossible to go without a really good lip balm.  <b>This one is filled with the brand's patented Blue Lagoon algae,</b> which hydrates and nourishes the lips from within for long-lasting hydration. </p>
      <p>
        <b>WHY I'M OBSESSED:</b>
      </p>
      <p>I love my big, full, round, and plump lips, but they're so high-maintenance. I have to literally baby them with lip balm all the time. Therefore, I appreciate a formula that doesn't feel fleeting. <b>This one stays put and is moisturizing for longer than usual</b>. I plan to keep it in my top five lineup of favorite balms all winter. </p>
