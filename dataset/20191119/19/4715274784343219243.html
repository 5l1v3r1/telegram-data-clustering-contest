      <p>It was a one-sided contest after Hexigetu dominated Gonzales from start to finish in all areas of the game. The Filipino tried his best to steal the win in the end, but his Chinese counterpart was too much that evening.  “I’m happy because I finished the fight, despite all the things that I’ve went through,” Gonzales said.  “I had a hard time sleeping in China because of the cold which goes down to -5 degrees. But those factors are part of it, there are no excuses because I know that I prepared for this.” Though the result did not go his way, Gonzales remains confidence. The match showed the Albay City native what he needs to work on, and that is exactly what he will be focusing on moving forward.  “I will train the moment I get back in the Philippines. Aside from keeping a healthy weight in the strawweight division, I plan to maximize and impose my strength in the division. I also hope to improve my takedown defense and grappling, things I hope to show next fight,” the 32-year-old said.  “I train almost every day to improve. This is a big lesson for me. I am confident that I can get back and rediscover the magic of my past performances.”  While the loss was certainly a tough one, Gonzales promises to be a different athlete the next time he steps foot inside the <a href="https://www.onefc.com/">ONE Championship</a> Circle. “I am always thankful for everyone who continues to support me amid my struggles, they’re the ones who give me strength to continue and inspire me moving forward,” Gonzales said.  “I promise that I will always give my best moving forward and they’ll see my improvements in my next bouts.” ONE Championship returns to the Lion City for one last time this year with <a href="https://www.onefc.com/events/edge-of-greatness/">ONE: EDGE OF GREATNESS</a> on 22 November at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.  The preliminary card starts on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or the ONE Super App at 6:30pm Philippine Standard Time (PHT). To watch the main card, go to ABS-CBN S+A at 8:30pm PHT. Or watch all the action for free by downloading the <a href="https://www.onefc.com/download-app/">ONE Super App. </a> </p>
