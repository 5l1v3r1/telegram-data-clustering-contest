      <h1>McDonald’s ‘hero’ gave customers extra nuggets for years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:12:29+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:12</time> by <a rel="author">Nadine DeNinno</a></address>
      <p>He’s already calling himself “The Robin Hood of McNuggets.”</p>
      <p>Former McDonald’s employee Cody Bondarchuk is being hailed a “hero” after he revealed in a now-viral tweet that he secretly gave out extra chicken McNuggets for two years — unbeknownst to his employer.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old from Edmonton, Canada says he put an extra nugget in every 10-piece box when he was employed at the fast-food chain from 2007 to 2009.</p>
      <p>“I worked at McDonald’s for two and a half years and I put 11 nuggets in almost every 10-piece I made,” <a href="https://twitter.com/codybondarchuk/status/1195498506640744449">he writes</a>.</p>
      <p>Of course, Twitter went wild with comments calling Bondarchuk a “hero,” “<a href="https://twitter.com/codybondarchuk/status/1195565314706030592">St. Nuggets</a>” and a would-be <a href="https://twitter.com/elevatorbob/status/1195572727551160320">Nobel Peace Prize award-winner</a>.</p>
      <p>“How to win the class war, one chicken nugget at a time,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Lionelvinyl/status/1195550869762297861">one fan wrote</a>. Another <a href="https://twitter.com/MakotoGoinNuts/status/1195929312366600192">chimed in</a>: “Not all heroes wear capes, just name tags.”</p>
      <p>After a fan referred to him as “<a href="https://twitter.com/Rosebud_nat/status/1195577282904985600">the Robin hood of nugz</a>,” the Canadian even added it to his profile bio.</p>

      <p>One Twitter user even <a href="https://twitter.com/thepoeticgopher/status/1195759687733522433">made an attempt</a> to tally the monetary value of Bondarchuk’s good deed, estimating it could be nearly $40,000.</p>
      <p>Bondarchuk’s admission also brought out more secrets from fellow fast-food workers, including <a href="https://twitter.com/msparkles1234/status/1195552533307019264">one Twitter user</a> who fessed up to piling on the cheese when making tacos at Taco Bell for over a year and <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnDom4/status/1195562324012126208">a KFC worker who admitted</a> to putting four or five pieces of chicken in every 3-piece meal.</p>
      <p>Bondarchuk wasn’t alone in his act of defiance either, telling local news CTV News Edmonton his co-workers did it, too.</p>
      <p>“It was something that a lot of my coworkers did as well,” <a href="https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/former-mcdonald-s-worker-s-tweet-about-doling-out-extra-mcnuggets-goes-viral-1.4691430">he said</a>. “It was really easy to overfill them without it looking weird when it was on the delivery line, and of course there are no cameras on the kitchen line.”</p>
      <p>After his tweet, which now has 899,000 likes, went viral, <a href="https://twitter.com/codybondarchuk/status/1195575868795437057">Bondarchuk joked</a> that he “underestimated the world’s love of both nuggets and free stuff.”</p>
      <p>“I’m seeing a lot of comments about y’all not deserving a hero but I just wanted to say that EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU DESERVES THOSE BONUS NUGGET,” <a href="https://twitter.com/codybondarchuk/status/1196520427259973632">he adds</a>.</p>
      <p>“Anything that’s a little dig at corporate overlords is popular,” he tells CTV News Edmonton. “I saw that Elon Musk liked it, which is very cool.”</p>
      <p>Of course, not everyone thought his Robin Hood-like act was a good deed. The former fast-food worker, who <a href="https://twitter.com/codybondarchuk/status/1195745810241081344">has a podcast</a> called “Heart Half Full” to deliver a “weekly dose of hope and optimism,” <a href="https://twitter.com/codybondarchuk/status/1196247263208595456">also hit back</a> at those who thought he cheated McDonald’s, including one who called it “corporate theft.”</p>
      <p>“I’m doing charity for McDonald’s. If anything I am owed a consulting fee,” <a href="https://twitter.com/codybondarchuk/status/1196247578678972417">he writes</a>.</p>
