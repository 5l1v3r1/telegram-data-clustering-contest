      <h1>NHAI, PWD lock horns over shoddy state of junctions</h1>
      <h2>Many parts of Vyttila and Kundannoor junctions, and service roads damaged due to movement of heavy vehicles</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:24:39+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/John-L-Paul-678/" target="_blank">John L. Paul</a></address>
      <p>The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has lashed out at the Public Works Department (PWD) for shoddy upkeep of roads in the vicinity of flyover work sites at Vyttila and Kundannoor, where chaos and traffic snarls rule the roost.</p>
      <p>“We issued no-objection certificate (NOC) to PWD (NH wing) to build flyovers at the two congested junctions, on the condition that the agency would ensure pothole-free NH Bypass, service roads and diversion roads. It is also duty-bound to remove all obstacles to smooth and safe movement of road users. Sadly, this has not been the case ever since flyover works began at Vyttila in December 2017 and at Kundannoor in March 2018,” said NHAI sources.</p>
      <p>The back-breaking rides, traffic hold-ups and chaos that lakhs of road users endure while passing through the two junctions could have been avoided if the PWD had taken a cue from Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL), which widened and strengthened diversion roads and readied overbridges, before beginning piling for the Kochi metro project.</p>
      <p>“The PWD failed to execute such preparatory works, despite the NH Bypass being used by inter-State, inter-district and intra-district vehicles. The PWD also went back on the assurance that the tarred portion of service roads in the vicinity of flyover work sites would be widened and reinforced, in order to bear the extra load of vehicles.”</p>
      <p>Subsequently, many parts of the two junctions and almost all the service roads through which vehicles were diverted gave away, since lorries and other heavy vehicles cause four-and-a-half-times more damage than light and medium vehicles. Service roads are not designed for repetitive movement of heavy vehicles. The result is there for all to see – faced with public ire, the agency is engaged in resurfacing many parts of the NH Bypass and service roads with concrete paver blocks.</p>
      <h3>Road repairs</h3>
      <p>Another NHAI official spoke of how the PWD’s NH and Roads wings failed to repair potholed parts on the NH Bypass, service roads and diversion roads, causing traffic snarls and accidents. “This has resulted in even ambulances getting trapped in snarls. They have been citing rains as an excuse. This is not true. We have been filling potholes within a day of it coming to our attention, by using a mix of baby metal and bitumen aggregate, which is compacted using a portable machine. This method can be adopted even in mild rain.”</p>
      <p>Responding to this, a PWD (NH wing) official said the NHAI had temporarily handed over only 720 metres at the two NH bypass junctions to PWD for flyover construction. “We are duty bound to maintain either side of the 720-metre stretches alone. The NHAI must ensure upkeep of areas outside this space.”</p>
      <p>An NHAI official rebutted this argument, saying that the NOC issued to PWD clearly states that the agency must maintain all roads in the ‘construction-zone area’ through which vehicles from the flyover site are diverted too. “The PWD has not made amends, despite us shooting off letters to them. The issue was also taken up at meetings convened by the District Collector.”</p>
