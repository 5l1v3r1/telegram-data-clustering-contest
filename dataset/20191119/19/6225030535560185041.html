      <p>#4 LATER CAT (6-1) exits a neck victory as the 3-2 favorite vs. New York-bred maiden claimers at this course/distance Nov. 1, and that was his first start after the Linda Rice claim. He will probably chase the pace under Irad Ortiz Jr, and can win this with another forward move.</p>
      <p>#3 Other Things Equal (5-2) owns ascending numbers for Chad Brown. The $335k Keeneland sales grad likes this distance and should stalk the pace.</p>
      <p>#5 Kumar (5-1) exits a turf route win, and he broke his maiden at this course/distance March 15. He should be forwardly placed.</p>
      <p>#6 Super Silver (7-2) is 1-for-11 and can be used underneath. He finished a 1/2 length behind <i>Other Things Equal</i> Oct. 20.</p>
      <p>#7 Crea’s Bklyn Law (9-2) is another worth considering in the exotics. He is 2-for-28 with twelve minor awards.</p>
