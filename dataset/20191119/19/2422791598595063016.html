      <p>EL ALTO, Bolivia -- Security forces in Bolivia on Tuesday launched an operation to supply gasoline from a major fuel plant that had been blockaded by supporters of former President Evo Morales.</p>
      <p>At least one person was killed and eight were injured during the operation in the city of El Alto, near La Paz, the public defender's office and a hospital said.</p>
      <p>The circumstances of the violence were not immediately clear, though an Associated Press journalist in the area heard shooting near the fuel plant.</p>
      <p>Smoke rose from fires set by protesters and a military helicopter was seen flying over the area.</p>
      <p>The public defender's office identified the man who was killed as 31-year-old Deybi Posto Cusi.</p>
      <p>Some Bolivian cities have reported food and gasoline shortages because of demonstrations by pro-Morales groups. The operation by security forces was aimed at restoring the supply of fuel to communities.</p>
      <p>Victor Hugo Zamora, the hydrocarbons minister, told ATB television that 23 tanker trucks were able to load up on fuel at the plant after days of blockades.</p>
      <p>Morales resigned on Nov. 10 following a disputed election and massive protests by Bolivians who believe he rigged the vote. He left for asylum in Mexico.</p>
      <p>About two-dozen people have been killed in unrest since the Oct. 20 election. An interim government says it wants to organize new elections, but it faces fierce opposition from Morales' camp.</p>
      <p>A U.N. envoy and church groups are trying to broker dialogue among Bolivia's factions.</p>
