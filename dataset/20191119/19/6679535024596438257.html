      <h1>BMC appoints interim CEOs at civic hospitals</h1>
      <h2>Focus will be on ensuring maintenance of infrastructure</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:30:51+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Jyoti-Shelar-3618/" target="_blank">Jyoti Shelar</a></address>
      <p>In a first, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has appointed interim Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) at its major hospitals to ensure the proper maintenance of infrastructure. Three Assistant Commissioners have been appointed as interim CEOs and they will have report to the deans of their respective hospitals.</p>
      <p>According to a letter issued by BMC Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi on Tuesday, Kiran Dighavkar, Assistant Commissioner of G/North ward, has been appointed as the CEO of KEM and Sion hospitals.</p>
      <p>Prashant Sakpale of K/East ward will hold the charge in Cooper Hospital and Devidas Kshirsagar of P/South ward will be responsible for Nair hospital and Nair Dental Hospital.</p>
      <p>Mr. Pardeshi said, “The CEOs shall carry out all administrative duties of the hospitals along with minor civil, mechanical and electrical repair works. The engineering and administrative wing of the hospitals shall report to the CEOs.” He said the interim CEOs would be required to devote one day in a week to oversee work at their respective hospitals.</p>
      <h3>Facing criticism</h3>
      <p>The BMC has been receiving a lot of flak owing to lack of maintenance and supervision of equipment at civic-run hospitals. Recently, a fire at KEM Hospital’s paediatric intensive care unit led to the amputation of a three-month-old child’s arm. Last year in March, two patients who were admitted for dialysis at the hospital sustained injuries in a slab collapse. Early this month, an air conditioning vent cover gave way in the operation theatre of HBT Trauma Hospital, but alert doctors and staff prevented the vent from falling on the patient undergoing the surgery. Though such incidents are widespread across civic hospitals, many of them go unreported.</p>
      <p>Mr. Dighavkar, who will be taking charge on Wednesday, said the deans of civic hospitals are usually busy managing doctors and patients. He said, “The idea of appointing CEOs is to focus on the infrastructure requirements of hospitals which are neglected due to heavy work pressure.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the BMC is in the process of appointing permanent CEOs. The civic body has placed advertisements inviting candidates and interviews will begin as soon as applications come in. Since a CEO is considered as the highest ranking officer, some BMC officers are concerned that having two power centres — the dean and the CEO — in civic-run institutions might lead to further chaos.</p>
