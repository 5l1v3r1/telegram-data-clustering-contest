      <p>The absence of adequate maternity benefits and leave provisions in India’s policy measures is despite the fact that mothers, even those working in the formal sector, are forced to disproportionately bear the care-giving burden while facing discrimination in recruitment, promotion and work allocation. Not only maternity provisions but other women-centred health care services are ignored, as is evident from a dearth of breast-feeding stations and separate functioning toilets in offices and workplaces. Underlying such policy neglect on the part of the government is an unwillingness of policymakers to de-glorify motherhood and see the liabilities, risks and forgone opportunities it entails (Editorial page, “The mother of non-issues,” Nov. 19).</p>
