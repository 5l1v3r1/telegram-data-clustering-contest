      <p>Rapper A$AP Rocky is designing new uniforms for the <a href="https://www.insider.com/asap-rocky-jail-sweden-pictures-of-swedish-prisons-2019-7">Swedish prison were he was held on assault charges</a> over the summer, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelineschneider/2019/11/15/aap-rocky-on-psychedelics-sweden-and-sexuality-at-summit-ideas-conference/#6ad001707951">according to a report from Forbes</a>.</p>
      <p>Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, spent a month in a Swedish jail after he was <a href="https://www.insider.com/us-rapper-aap-rocky-to-remain-in-swedish-custody-trump-plans-to-intervene-2019-7">detained in July over an altercation in Stockholm</a>. He was <a href="https://www.insider.com/aap-rocky-guilty-assault-swedish-court-2019-8">found guilty of assault on August 14</a>. He was released from custody on August 2 after <a href="https://www.insider.com/trump-officials-want-thank-you-from-asap-rocky-sweden-arrest-2019-8">President Donald Trump lobbied for his release</a>, and was not ordered to return.</p>
      <p>In an interview at a festival called <a href="https://la19.summit.co/">Summit LA19</a> on November 11, Mayers told Summit co-founder Jeff Rosenthal his plan for giving back to Sweden prisons.</p>
      <p>According to Forbes, he’s designing a new wardrobe and uniforms for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-48934378">Kronoberg remand prison</a>, where he was held while <a href="https://www.insider.com/asap-rocky-charged-assault-sweden-despite-donald-trump-effort-2019-7">facing assault charges</a>.</p>
      <p>Mayers’ lawyer Noemi Kadas, told the media outlet <a href="https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/a/OpXvBk/asap-rocky-vill-designa-klader--till-intagna-pa-kronobergshaktet">Nöjesbladet</a> that Rocky “expressed a desire to donate jerseys to the inmates on the Kronoberg Detention Centre. The jerseys in question would have a print and the colour would of course be adapted to the rules of the Prison Service so that the order and safety are maintained.”</p>
      <p>The uniforms would be green sweatpants and sweatshirt with the word PROMENVD across the front and back, according to images sent to <a href="https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/a/OpXvBk/asap-rocky-vill-designa-klader--till-intagna-pa-kronobergshaktet">Nöjesbladet</a>.</p>
      <p>Fredrik Wallin, the warden at the Kronoberg Detention Centre said that he’d heard Mayers wanted to make a donation but nothing has been confirmed.</p>
      <p>Mayers is returning to Sweden in December for a performance in Stockholm, and most of the proceeds will go to “inmates and prison reformation,” Mayers said.</p>
      <p>He said he met a lot of young hip hop fans while incarcerated and connected with them over music.</p>
      <p>“When I was going through my whole situation, the whole time I used to look on television and see Swedish fans showing me so much love and I want to give it back,” he said.</p>
      <p>Insider has contacted Mayers and his manager for comment.</p>
