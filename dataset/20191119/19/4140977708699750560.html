            <b>NSW Vs TAS Dream11 : Bottom of the table encounter sees two sides face off in a bid to keep their season alive.  </b>
          </p>
          <p>Two sides, the twelve encounters played in between them and a mere three wins mustered up in tandem. They are numbers which clearly allude to how bewildered a campaign it has been for today’s opponent, seeing both of them firmly perched in the bottom of the league standings, an ordeal both know they need to stem at the earliest.</p>
          <p>For New South Wales in particular, it’s been a horrendous outing in this edition of the March One-Day Cup with the side managing to string together just the solitary win in the six matches they have traversed in. Their predicament was well documented the last time around as the side were subjected to a four wicket defeat by Queensland Bulls. </p>

                <p>Bundled out for a harrowing 223 while batting first, the side saw their meagre score being peeled off with 17 balls as they were outshone and outplayed in all the departments of the game. Elsewhere, their opponents of today, New South Wales haven’t had it any better with their chastening from seeing them just about edging Queensland Bulls into fifth place with the one additional win over their opponents.</p>
                <p>The side were put down to their fourth defeat in six matches as their harsh form continued. Needing 265 to need, the side faltered and shambolically collapsed to fall short by the barest of margins, a defeat which epitomised the lack of composure and semblance which has resulted in the side unable to snap out of their wayward spiral in the tournamnet.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>The overcast conditions will see an already inclement surface for the batters take a turn for the worse with the pacers getting immense deviation over here in the first part of the encounter. It will lead the side winning the toss opting to come out and field first and maximise on the bowler friendly conditions to put up as small a target for their batters.</p>

                            <h3>NSW vs TAS Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>In a season when Tasmania have completely fallen apart and lost their way with not one even bit going right for the side, opener and wicket-keeper Ben McDermott has offered some kind of solace to the unit. The player has shed a beacon of light on an otherwise horrid batting performance, seeing us repose faith in him for this encounter as well.</p>
                            <h3>NSW vs TAS Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>His counterpart Caleb Jewell will be giving him company for the day with the opener being in sublime touch as well, making the duo two players who will be tasked with heavily to hold fort for the side. George Bailey will be his partner for the day whilst from the other side we are making an advent with Daniel Hughes after the player doled out 83 runs in the side’s last encounter in what was a dependable and flawless performance by the bat.</p>
                            <h3>NSW vs TAS Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>We begin our all-rounder facet with Moises Henriques from New South Wales, a player who was heavily indulged in Hughes’ alluring knock the last time around. Henriques himself earned the 98 runs in his kitty with the two players piling on a behemoth of an 88 run partnership, a stand which saw the side remain in their run chase till the culminating over.</p>
                            <p>His incredible 5-46 with the ball, an articulate and astute show which cut short the opposition’s work to leave them disgruntled makes all-rounder Daniel Sams the ext pick from the outfit. The player has been in imperious and feisty touch with the ball, sending down a daunting wicket to wicket line and length to send oppositions packing with disdain to make him an instant pick. </p>
                            <p>Arjun Nair comes in as well to complete the trivalent of selections from the unit whilst from Tasmania we are choosing just the one name in the form of James Faulkner after his 30 runs with the bat.</p>
                            <h3>NSW vs TAS Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Frontline pacer Harry Conway from New South Wales is going to love his time out on this wicket, a rack where his role with the new ball will prove to be quintessential in side’s rummage for consummate success. The quick will get immense deviation, getting the ball to move either way as he sends down a wicket to wicket line and length to leave the opponents flummoxed and flabbergasted.</p>
                            <p>From Tasmanian meanwhile we are opting for the two bowlers in the form of Nathan Ellis and Jackson Bird who registered figures of 2-28 with the ball.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>We are choosing Daniel as our unit’s captain for this fixture whilst Henriques will be our vice-captain.</p>
