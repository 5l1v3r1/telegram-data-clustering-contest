      <h2>5 things to know about France’s massive mobility reforms.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:00:26+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Hanne Cokelaere</a></address>
      <p>Updating France’s outdated transport rules was always going to be a challenge. But after a year of Yellow Jacket protests sparked by opposition to fuel price increases, the political stake in the reform is enormous.</p>
      <p>The National Assembly <a href="https://www.politico.eu/pro/french-parliament-gives-final-approval-to-mobility-reforms/">on Tuesday signed off</a> on France’s first overhaul of mobility policies since <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006068730">1982</a>. The <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/15/pdf/ta/ta0331.pdf">bill</a> is an attempt to blend together three policy aims: to green transport, boost innovation and digitization, and improve transport links — all while not leading to an explosion of popular opposition.</p>
      <p>“The challenge is to escape a two-speed France in which we introduce high-speed trains for the metropolises, as roads and railway networks deteriorate at the same time, and in which a big part of our country has no alternative solution to the car,” Ecology Minister Elisabeth Borne told <a href="https://www.franceinter.fr/emissions/l-invite-de-8h20-le-grand-entretien/l-invite-de-8h20-le-grand-entretien-04-mars-2019">France Inter</a> in March. She was transport minister when the package was launched a year ago.</p>
      <p>The battle over the law turned the reform into a hard-fought bill with a record number of amendments. It passed <a href="https://www.politico.eu/pro/french-senate-opts-to-reject-mobility-bill-in-symbolic-vote/">despite opposition from the senate</a>, which isn’t controlled by President Emmanuel Macron’s La République En Marche party.</p>
      <p>Here are five key takeaways from the new legislation, which still has to be signed by Macron before it goes into effect.</p>
      <aside>The bill cements France’s ambition to fully decarbonize road transport by 2050.</aside>
      <h3>1. Down with diesel (eventually)</h3>
      <p>The bill cements France’s ambition to fully decarbonize road transport by 2050. It aims to end the sale of combustion-engine cars and light commercial vehicles by 2040, and gradually increase the share of low and very low emission vehicles.</p>
      <p>That’s too little and too late for green groups, which wanted a 2030 cut-off for fossil-fuel car sales — but an amendment to bring forward the deadline was <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dyn/15/amendements/2206/AN/539">voted down</a> in the National Assembly.</p>
      <p>“The latest figures published [about transport emissions] should have pushed MPs to accelerate, not slow down, the transition,” Climate Action Network, a federation of green groups, <a href="https://reseauactionclimat.org/retard-climatique-dans-les-transports-lassemblee-fait-du-surplace/">said</a> in September.</p>
      <h3>2. Clamping down on e-scooters</h3>
      <p>French authorities didn’t know how to deal with the arrival of free-floating electric scooters in the summer of 2018. The speedy little vehicles <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/escooters-test-europe-antiquated-traffic-rules/">didn’t fit</a> into any of the categories of France’s antiquated traffic laws, and there was little city authorities could do to control them.</p>

      <p>Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo <a href="https://presse.paris.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Trottinettes-%C3%A9lectriques-Paris-renforce-la-r%C3%A9gulation.pdf">complained</a> the explosion of e-scooters was “lawless in the absence of a clear national legal framework.”</p>
      <p>Regulators have since been scrambling to give cities more powers.</p>
      <p>An October ministerial <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/decret/2019/10/23/INTS1913464D/jo/texte">decree</a> added e-scooters to France’s transport rulebook, along with new <a href="https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Espace-presse/Dossiers-de-presse/Les-trottinettes-electriques-entrent-dans-le-code-de-la-route">measures</a> including a minimum age, maximum speed and specific guidelines on where they can be used.</p>
      <p>The new mobility bill also hands local authorities the power to limit the number of vehicles and operators, and impose additional requirements, including on maintenance, noise and pollution.</p>
      <h3>3. Protecting France’s need for speed</h3>
      <p>Ahead of the Yellow Jackets protests came the wave of national demonstrations against the June 2018 <a href="https://www.gouvernement.fr/argumentaire/80-kmh-la-mesure-entre-en-vigueur-le-1er-juillet">decision</a> by Prime Minister Edouard Philippe to lower the speed limit on rural roads from 90 kilometers per hour to 80 kph.</p>
      <p>The goal seemed uncontroversial — to prevent 300 to 400 road fatalities a year. But many people in rural areas saw this as a high-handed effort by Parisian elites to interfere with their way of life.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Cutting speed did save lives. According to figures published in May, road fatalities last year fell by 5.3 percent, dropping to <a href="https://www.gouvernement.fr/securite-routiere-une-baisse-record-de-la-mortalite-en-2018">a record low</a> of 3,488. “The facts show that when we applied this measure, the results in terms of accidents and road deaths have been good. Excuse me: They weren’t just good, they were the best ever registered in France,” Philippe <a href="https://www.europe1.fr/politique/edouard-philippe-sur-les-80-kmh-il-ny-a-jamais-eu-aussi-peu-de-morts-sur-les-routes-3874145">said</a> in March.</p>
      <p>But the politics proved toxic and the embattled government is backtracking in the new mobility bill. The law gives regional authorities the freedom to return to a 90 kph speed limit on some smaller roads.</p>
      <p>The national federation of road victims <a href="http://www.fnvictimesdelaroute.asso.fr/vitesse_80kmh_recul_incomprehensible_premier_ministre_limitation.php">denounced</a> the policy change as a “base political maneuver.”</p>
      <p>"The government is making a choice with far-reaching consequences by preferring to save its majority rather than the lives of drivers," the group said.</p>
      <h3>4. Keeping things loose for platforms</h3>
      <p>France has the reputation of being an overly regulated economy stifled by red tape. That's not the case for the new legislation covering gig economy workers at companies such as Uber and Deliveroo.</p>
      <aside>“This is going to be able to create a very socially responsible way that platforms can engage with independent workers while preserving their independent status” <i>— Joanne Kubba, Uber’s head of policy for Europe</i></aside>
      <p>The companies insist they don't have employees, but freelancers able to work when they please — a definition that’s crucial to their businesses as they don’t pay benefits or social security taxes. Many European countries and courts are increasingly skeptical about that definition, but the French bill leans toward the apps.</p>
      <p>The bill introduces <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uber-deliveroo-france-digital-platforms-see-a-win-in-mobility-law-overhaul/">a voluntary charter</a> for platforms which doesn't classify workers as employees — an attempt to balance strengthening workers’ rights with promoting the digital economy.</p>
      <p>That approach was opposed in the senate and by the French digital council, a government advisory body, which sent a <a href="https://cnnumerique.fr/files/uploads/2019/Lettre_ouverte_LOM.pdf">letter</a> to Borne, MPs and senators in September calling for the measure to be dropped. “Remuneration, working conditions or social protection shouldn’t be an element of a service announcement on the social responsibility of platforms, but the fruit of a collective negotiation,” wrote the group’s president, Salwa Toko.</p>
      <p>But Borne resisted calls to turn platform workers into full-blown employees, saying that “we have to accept that a certain number of young people … wish to have an independent status.”</p>
      <p>That approach thrilled Uber, which wants the law copied across the Continent. “This is going to be able to create a very socially responsible way that platforms can engage with independent workers while preserving their independent status,” Joanne Kubba, Uber’s head of policy for Europe, told POLITICO.</p>
      <h3>5. Paying the mobility bill’s bills</h3>
      <p>One of the main ambitions of the reforms is to boost public transport, in particular in the badly connected regions that have also been a hotbed of Yellow Jackets protests.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>That will be expensive. The government <a href="https://www.ecologique-solidaire.gouv.fr/projet-loi-dorientation-des-mobilites-gouvernement-presente-orientations-financement-programmation">wants</a> to spend €13.4 billion until 2022, mostly to upgrade rail infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Disagreements over financing were the main reason the senate rejected the mobility bill, and that dispute continues as lawmakers discuss the 2020 budget bill. The National Assembly <a href="https://twitter.com/AssembleeNat/status/1196836219910545409">approved</a> the bill Tuesday. Senators last week <a href="http://www.senat.fr/fileadmin/Fichiers/Images/commission/Developpement_durable/6_pages_pour_mise_en_ligne.pdf">backed</a> an amendment that would shift the revenue generated by fuel taxes to improve transport links.</p>
      <p>Green groups <a href="https://reseauactionclimat.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/evaluation-lom-290519.pdf">complained</a> that earlier versions of the legislation created a “fiscal paradise” by going easy on trucks and planes. As a result, Borne <a href="https://www.publicsenat.fr/article/politique/elisabeth-borne-annonce-une-ecotaxe-sur-les-vols-aeriens-au-depart-de-la-france">said</a> the government will decrease its <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/15/projets/pl2272.asp#P3987_442752">rebate</a> on fuel costs for tuckers by 2 cents per liter — a measure the sector <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/roadblock-awaits-the-continents-truckers/">warns</a> could hurt their competitiveness.</p>
      <p>She also announced an “ecotax” on <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/15/projets/pl2272.asp#P4004_444249">plane tickets</a> that should take effect on January 1. The €180 million raised by the tax will go entirely toward day-to-day transport improvements, Borne said.</p>
