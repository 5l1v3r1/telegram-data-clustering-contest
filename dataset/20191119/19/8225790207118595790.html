      <p>BROOKFIELD, Wisc. (Gray News) – With Thanksgiving just around the corner, a smart turkey would be laying low this time of year.</p>
      <p>But not this Wisconsin bird, this tom is enamored with a U.S. Postal Service truck.</p>
      <p>Sherry Michaels captured the turkey’s antics in her neighborhood west of Milwaukee.</p>
      <p>“Our poor mail carrier has been dealing with this for a month!” she said on Facebook this week. “This turkey has been stalking the mail truck throughout the entire neighborhood. … Oh, gosh. This is so funny.”</p>

      <p>Her video shows the mail carrier’s feathery friend chasing the truck from house to house, even circling the vehicle during its stops. It’s the same behavior <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVchLV1isxU">mating males</a> exhibit in the wild.</p>
      <p>Is it love?</p>
      <p>The turkey’s not saying, but social media is gobbling up this video. The post has more than 2 million views.</p>
