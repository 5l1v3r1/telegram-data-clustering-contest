      <h3>Water Rushing Beneath Us</h3>
      <p>The sign read: Cross Ford at Your Own Risk. “What’s a ford?” I asked. “A low water bridge,” you said, slowing the car. The ford was submerged, but you drove onto it and opened your door. Water rushed beneath the car. “Open yours,” you said. I sat, frozen. You laughed. I opened the door an inch, then more. “Now listen.” The sound of the creek filled the car. I breathed in wet grass, mud, dead leaves. I reached down and let the water run through my fingertips. Life with you, I knew, would be different. — <i>Jessica Braun</i></p>

      <h3>Something to Give</h3>
      <p>The last time I saw my grandma, she had no idea who I was. She’d lost everything: her memories, her laugh, her weight. She’d shiver, constantly. “Cold,” she’d whisper. “Cold.” I kept trying to give her a blanket, but she’d panic every time and hand it back to me. We repeated this until, finally, she used all her energy to reach out and wrap the blanket around me. For the first time, she relaxed, smiled — perfectly content as she shivered. Even with everything taken from her, she found something to give. — <i>Julia Camp</i></p>

      <h3>It Could Have Been a Romantic Tragedy</h3>
      <p>The movie wasn’t a romantic tragedy, but the date almost was. Jane looked up and smiled as I slid past her, with a tub of popcorn in one hand and a soda in the other. I slipped, dropping all of the popcorn on her head. Everyone in the theater gasped. Time seemed to stop. I was at a loss for words. I blurted out, “Would you like some soda with our popcorn?” She stared up slack-jawed, then burst out laughing. It was then that our story changed from romantic tragedy to romantic comedy.<b> </b>— <i>Marty Hafner</i></p>

      <h3>It’s O.K. to Feel Fear</h3>
      <p>My daughter couldn’t fall asleep because she was scared. Nothing helped — not the backrub or child valerian drops or my assurance of no monsters. She spiraled into hiccuping sobs. I pleaded, “Honey, everyone’s scared of something.” “No! You’re not scared of anything.” “I am!” “What are you scared of?” I tried to think of some comforting half-truth. “See? You’re not scared of anything!” “I am,” I whispered. “I’m scared … of getting old … and my anger. And consumerism, stupidity, children without attention spans, distracted drivers and — ” “O.K., have good dreams, Mama.” She turned and fell asleep. — <i>Karen Rizzo</i></p>
