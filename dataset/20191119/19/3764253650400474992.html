        <b>There was a reason the police helicopter deployed to Kogi for the recently held governorship election dropped teargas in some locations in the state, according a report attributed to the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Daily Trust reports that Adamu spoke with journalists in Abuja after a meeting between President Muhammadu Buhari and service chiefs.</p>
      <p>IGP Adamu reportedly said the helicopter was deployed for crime prevention during the election.</p>
      <p>According to him, the helicopter had to intervene in other to frustrate those engaged in fighting and snatching ballot boxes.</p>
      <p>The police chief noted that the law enforcement agency was fully prepared for the election because of an initial understanding of possible violence during the polls in Bayelsa and Kogi.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng</b> reported how the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Sunday, November 17, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276465-kogi-decides-pdp-rejects-governorship-election-results-demands-cancellation-poll.html">said it was rejecting the results</a> of the governorship election in Kogi state <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276089-live-updates-kogi-bayelsa-governorship-elections-begin.html">as was officially declared</a> by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).</p>
      <p>PDP's statement announcing its stand against the election came as INEC announced the results of the election in some local government areas in the state showing that <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/governor-yahaya-bello.html">Yahaya Bello</a> of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was taking the lead.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/1589-dino-melaye.html">Dino Melaye</a>, a former federal lawmaker, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276511-kogi-election-dino-melaye-rejects-senatorial-rerun-results.html">rejected the results of the Kogi West senatorial district rerun polls</a> released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Sunday, November 17.</p>
      <p><i>“The innovation is that what we had is what I have christened ‘Helicopter election’. For the first time, rigging has been advanced to the level that now the use of a helicopter in perpetuating this electoral atrocity manifested yesterday,"</i> he said.</p>
