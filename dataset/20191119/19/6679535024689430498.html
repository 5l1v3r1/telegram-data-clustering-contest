      <h2>Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to request Parliament to pass Appropriation Bill</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:43:23+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Sharad-Vyas-203/" target="_blank">Sharad Vyas</a></address>
      <p>Maharashtra’s Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari will request Parliament to pass the ₹5,000-crore Appropriation Bill to grant financial aid to farmers affected by unseasonal rains in the State.</p>
      <p>While it may take time for contributions or help to arrive from the Centre, Maharashtra will most likely draw ₹5,000 crore from its contingency fund, which has a withdrawal limit of only ₹250 crore a day, said senior officials. However, the Bill will also seek to raise the existing drawing limits of the CF, officials said. “The State government will raise supplementary grants in the next State budget for the same amount (₹5000 crore) to recover it as expenditure,” said a senior official from the Governor’s office.</p>
      <p>The governor will need to tap into the Contingency Fund following recent crop losses estimated to be to the tune of ₹8,000 crore. An estimated 1 crore farmers have suffered damage to their crops due to unseasonal rains over 87 lakh hectares in Vidarbha, Marathwada and parts of Western Maharashtra, officials said. The damage is spread across 34 districts and 325 talukas. Mr. Koshyari has already announced a relief of ₹8,000 per hectare up to 2 hectares for agricultural Kharif crops and ₹18,000 per hectare up to 2 hectares for horticulture or perennial crops.</p>
      <p>While kickstarting the disbursement of aid, Mr. Koshyari on Tuesday announced that only farmers who have suffered over 33% in damage to crops would be compensated. He also directed banks to not use the money being deposited in farmers’ accounts directly for any kind of recovery by financial institutions. “Banks have been asked to not touch this money or they will be punished. For now, we will disburse about ₹3,000 crore as compensation, which we have in our kitty until the bill is passed,” said an official.</p>
      <p>Political parties have been putting pressure on the governor to increase the compensation amount. The Shiv Sena has demanded the amount be increased to ₹25,000 per hectare, and held a protest outside Parliament. Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece <i>Saamna</i>,<i> </i>in an editorial, has criticised the governor for announcing such a low amount.</p>
      <p>The Congress and NCP have also demanded compensation of over ₹20,000.</p>
      <p>The Aam Aadmi Party has demanded the amount be raised to ₹50,000 as was being done in New Delhi.</p>
