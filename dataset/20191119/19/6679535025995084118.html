      <h1>From Kochi to Assam, to track accused</h1>
      <h2>Special squad could have nabbed all five accused had they fast-tracked journey</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:34:08+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:34</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>The special squad probing the attempted ATM robbery at Vazhakkualm in August could have nabbed all five accused from Assam earlier last month had they fast-tracked their journey and were able to plug the leakage of news about the arrest of one of the accused, it has emerged.</p>
      <p>The squad had been to Rupahihut in Nagaon district of Assam earlier last month after it emerged that the accused involved in the case hailed from there.</p>
      <p>Luck shined on them when two of the accused got involved in a mobile shop theft there and one of them, Jahurul Islam, was detained by the local people and handed over to the local police.</p>
      <h3>Absconding</h3>
      <p>While the investigation team managed to get custody of the accused arrested by the local police, fleeing of the other accused proved to be a major blow to the investigation. He probably alerted the rest of the accused, including two brothers, who were all in the same locality but switched off their mobile phones and went absconding shortly thereafter.</p>
      <p>“The investigation team managed to trace the identities of all the accused who all had criminal background. Though the team visited all their households, it proved futile. It emerged that they had gone into hiding in the forest nearby knowing about the search,” said Vazhakkulam police sources.</p>
      <p>In fact, it later emerged that one of the accused was in Kuruppampady near Perumbavoor till October 9, when Jahurul Islam was picked up but returned to Assam the very next day probably after hearing the news of the arrest.</p>
      <p>In hindsight, it is felt that the team could have had a better chance of rounding up all the accused had they gone to Assam earlier. While the attempted ATM robbery took place on August 22, the investigation team left for Assam only in October. The trip had to be delayed owing to the flood and the disquiet over the National Register of Citizens in Assam.</p>
      <p>The Vazhakkulam police took Jahurul Islam to the crime scene at Kalloorkkadu Junction last month and recovered two iron rods and a hammer the accused had abandoned. The police had earlier recovered a few pair of gloves and dresses from the scene shortly after the attempt.</p>
      <p>The accused had dislodged the ATM machine belonging to Federal Bank and dragged it about 50 metres before attempting to break it.</p>
