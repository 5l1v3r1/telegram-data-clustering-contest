      <p>Jeremy Vine has apologised after giving some people the impression he was offering Scotland's oldest bagpipe player a "shedload" of cannabis.</p>
      <p>The presenter, 54, made the gaffe on BBC Radio 2 during a live broadcast from Glasgow on Monday.</p>
      <p>Vine told Billy McVie, 93, that he had "plenty of puff" to spare if the musician happened to run out during his time on the show.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-vine-pleads-queen-speak-20133636">Vine</a> later apologised after being made aware that his comments could be interpreted as meaning "I've got a shedload of ganja".</p>
      <p>He said on Twitter: "I apologise for the phrase I used earlier on the radio.</p>
      <p>"While interviewing Scotland's oldest bagpiper, Billy McVie, 93, I told him: "I have got plenty of puff if you run out.</p>
      <p>"I now understand that means 'I've got a shedload of ganja if you've smoked all yours'."</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Mr McVie gave Vine a tutorial in playing the great Highland bagpipe, as well as a lesson in the instrument's history.</p>
      <p>Referring to his guest as Bob, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/womans-phone-call-jeremy-vine-18803830">Vine</a> told listeners: "Bob is on a mission to convince us that the bagpipe is capable of producing the most melodic and beautiful music and that it has unfairly been described as discordant and screechy.</p>
      <p>"The joy of having you here is that we can cleanse our minds of all the election talk now.</p>
      <p>"We don't have to do any politics. Do we? You don't need to say anything about politics here."</p>
      <p>Earlier in the programme, a General Election special, Vine discussed Glasgow's "international reputation" for "the scourge of drugs" and spoke to a former heroin addict helping others in the city to fight addiction.</p>
