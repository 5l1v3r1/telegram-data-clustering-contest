      <h1>Tyler, The Creator Vents About Pop Stars &amp; Industry Gatekeepers Not Trusting His Ideas</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:38:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:38</time> by <a rel="author">Eddie Fu</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/Tyler-the-creator">Tyler, The Creator</a>’s latest album, <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Tyler-the-creator/Igor"><i>IGOR</i></a>, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and earned him <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/music/igor/tyler-the-creator">widespread critical praise</a>, but the California rapper isn’t fully satisfied with his success. In a new <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/tyler-the-creator-provocateur-of-the-year-2019"><i>GQ</i> cover story</a>, Tyler opened up about his frustration with not yet earning the approval of pop stars and gatekeepers like Hot 97 DJ <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Funkmaster-flex">Funkmaster Flex</a>.</p>
      <p>He revisited the experience of <a href="https://genius.com/a/tyler-the-creator-s-earfquake-was-turned-down-by-both-justin-bieber-rihanna">being turned down</a> by both <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Justin-bieber">Justin Bieber</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Rihanna">Rihanna</a> for <a href="https://genius.com/Tyler-the-creator-earfquake-lyrics">“EARFQUAKE,”</a> the breakout hit from <i>IGOR</i>.</p>
      <p>“I wanted him to have it, and it didn’t work out,” Tyler remembered about sending the song to Bieber. “I be trying to send people songs and it didn’t work.”</p>
      <p>Tyler also <a href="https://genius.com/a/tyler-the-creator-flirts-with-funkmaster-flex-in-hilarious-radio-freestyle">recalled a sit down with Funk Flex</a> in which he seemed to open the hip-hop traditionalist’s ears to his music. According to <i>GQ</i>, the rapper said Flex never followed up with his thoughts on <i>IGOR</i> after the interview.</p>
      <p>“It’s just, like, ‘Trust me, bro,'” Tyler said about the gatekeepers and figureheads of mainstream pop. “I know this isn’t your type of thing, but I know that this end result will be a good idea if you just let me cook.”</p>
      <p>However, the rapper seems determined to figure out how he can tackle the challenge—regardless of how long it takes.</p>
      <p>“That’s the one thing I can’t crack,” he said. “I don’t know what the fuck it is. To just trust me on little shit like that. It’s still a learning curve. I’ve figured everything else out thus far. It might take long. It might be next week. It might be another three years.”</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the interview, Tyler spoke about the delicate balancing act between humor and art that he continues to navigate with his latest album. “The <i>IGOR</i> shit plays a thin line between goofy and funny and art,” he explained. “I always have to be careful so it doesn’t fuck everyone’s perception up. It’s art, and an idea.”</p>
      <p>All of these comments align with a recent <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tyler-the-creator-is-a-singular-talent-11572960622"><i>Wall Street Journal Magazine</i> interview</a> in which Tyler explained how he <a href="https://genius.com/a/tyler-the-creator-stopped-trolling-online-to-earn-the-same-respect-as-kanye-west-pharrell-jay-z">made a concerted effort</a> to change his online image in order to win the same respect as his idols.</p>
