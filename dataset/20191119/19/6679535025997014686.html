      <p>The State government has decided to reopen the three sugar factories at Anakapalli (Visakhapatnam), Chennur (Kadapa) and Gajulamandyam (Chittoor).</p>
      <p>Latest technologies will be introduced in another four factories that are functioning. The sugar factories will also be asked to diversify and focus on the by-products. A roadmap is being prepared to make the sugar factories self-reliant.</p>
      <p>At a review meeting on Tuesday, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy asked the officials to take steps to clear the dues that were to be paid by the sugar factories to the farmers. As part of the revival plan, the dues of employees should also be cleared, he said. “Also, prepare an action plan to restore the past glory of the sugar factories in the State,” he told the officials.</p>
      <p>The financial burden on the 10 cooperative sugar mills was ₹891.13 crore, which included sugar stocks piled up in the factories, the officials said. Sugarcane production in the State was 102.3 lakh tonnes in 2006–07. Of this, 100.91 lakh tonnes had been used by the factories for crushing. But by 2018–19, the production had come down to 58.04 lakh tonnes and crushing to 54.05 lakh tonnes.</p>
      <p>Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy asked the officials to take steps to ensure that sugarcane cultivation did not come down in the areas where the sugar mills were located.</p>
      <p>In fulfilment of the promise made in the manifesto, he directed the officials to take steps to provide ₹4 per litre as bonus to the farmers who supply milk to cooperative dairies.</p>
