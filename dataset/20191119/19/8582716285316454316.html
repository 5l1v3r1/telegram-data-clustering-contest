      <p><b>MADRID — </b>Two days after clinching the doubles title in the ATP Finals, French duo Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut gave France an opening win in the Davis Cup Finals.</p>
      <p>Herbert and Mahut rallied to defeat Ben McLachlan and Yasutaka Uchiyama of Japan 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-5 in the deciding doubles match in Group A on Tuesday, giving top-ranked France a 2-1 victory.</p>
      <p>The French duo squandered two match points while serving at 5-4, but capitalized on their chance at 6-5 to clinch the victory for last year's Davis Cup runner-up.</p>
      <p>The teams were tied after Jo-Wilfried Tsonga cruised past Uchiyama 6-2, 6-1 and Yoshihito Nishioka defeated Gael Monfils 7-5, 6-2.</p>
      <p>In the new Davis Cup format, teams play only two singles and a doubles in each tie, with the group winners advancing to the knockout stage.</p>
      <p>Herbert and Mahut did not drop a single set in five matches at the ATP Finals, where they defeated Raven Klaasen of South Africa and Michael Venus of New Zealand in the final on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Argentina comfortably defeated Chile 3-0, while Kazakhstan also needed the doubles match to beat the Netherlands 2-1 and clinch its first away Davis Cup win since 2011.</p>
      <p>Guido Pella beat Nicolas Jarry 6-4, 6-3 and Diego Schwartzman defeated Cristian Garin 6-2, 6-2 to give Argentina the opening win in Group C. The tie was already decided when Máximo González and Leonardo Mayer topped Jarry and Hans Podlipnik-Castillo 6-3, 7-5 in the doubles match.</p>
      <p>"It's the end of the season but I think I played one of the best matches for sure of the year, maybe in my career," the 14th-ranked Schwartzman said. "I think Guido helped me a lot to be more confident in this match and I played unreal tennis."</p>
      <p>Kazakhstan took the opening win against the Netherlands in Group E when Mikhail Kukushkin and Alexander Bublik defeated Robin Haase and Jean-Julien Rojer 6-4, 7-6 (2) in the deciding doubles match.</p>
      <p>Kukushkin had beaten Botic van de Zanschulp 6-2, 6-2, while Haase defeated Bublik 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (5).</p>
      <p>Host Spain opens against Russia later Tuesday with top-ranked Rafael Nadal playing. Russia defeated defending champions Croatia on Monday.</p>
      <p>Serbia's Novak Djokovic and Britain's Andy Murray will make their first appearance in the revamped competition on Wednesday. Serbia takes on Japan and Britain plays against the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>The new Davis Cup is being played in World Cup-style with all 18 teams playing in a single venue in the same week. It is the result of a 25-year partnership between the International Tennis Federation and Kosmos, a group co-founded by Barcelona soccer player Gerard Piqué.</p>
      <p>Organizers said more than 12,000 fans attended the matches on the three courts on Monday. More than 8,000 were there for Sunday's Open Day.</p>
      <p>Tickets for Spain's match on the 12,000-capacity center court at the "Magic Box" tennis complex were sold out in advance.</p>
      <p>Organizers had said more than 100,000 tickets had been sold ahead of the week-long tournament.</p>
