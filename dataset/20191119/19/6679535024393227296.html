      <h1>Crime Branch begins probe into KU marks scam</h1>
      <h2>Investigation in the wake of a request by the university, which also has been conducting an internal inquiry</h2>

      <p>The Crime Branch of the Kerala Police has commenced a probe into the alleged modification of moderated marks for examinations that were conducted by the University of Kerala.</p>
      <p>The investigation comes in the wake of a request put forth by the university, which has also been conducting an internal enquiry.</p>
      <p>A team led by M.S. Santhosh, Assistant Commissioner, Crime Detachment, recorded the statements of senior varsity officials including the Registrar, Controller of Examinations, and the Director of the Computer Centre. The police are likely to investigate whether the issue is indeed an orchestrated malpractice or the result of a technical error.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the internal enquiry being led by Pro Vice Chancellor P.P. Ajayakumar is learnt to have recorded the shortcomings of the tabulation software. .</p>
      <p>The Controller of Examinations had initially directed the Director of Computer Centre to address the problems in November 2016, following which another one was issued three months later. Recently, the Controller of Examinations had flagged the practice of officials in the examination section logging into the software using the credentials of others. It was then ordered to cancel the login IDs of those who were transferred to other sections. In light of the lapses, the Director of the Computer Centre has been served a show-case notice by the Registrar.</p>
      <p>It has also come to light that Deputy Registrar A.R. Renuka, who was suspended, had written to the Computer Centre seeking steps to suspend her login credentials soon after she had been transferred in November 2018.</p>
      <h3>KSU agitation</h3>
      <p>A demonstration that was taken out to the Assembly by Kerala Students Union (KSU) activists to demand comprehensive investigations into the varsity issue as well as the Walayar case turned violent, leaving numerous agitators injured.</p>
      <p>Shafi Parambil, MLA, and KSU State president K.M. Abhijith sustained significant head and leg injuries in the clash that lasted for over an hour during which traffic along the MG Road was disrupted. Numerous activists were forcibly removed and taken to the Armed Police camp in Nandavanam, where their arrests were recorded.</p>
      <p>Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran condemned the incident.</p>
