      <h1>Top police officer's career in ruins after she is convicted of possessing child abuse video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:39:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/martin-evans/" target="_blank">Martin Evans</a></address>
      <p>The career of one of the country's most senior black female officers lays in tatters after she was convicted of possessing a child abuse video.</p>
      <p>Acting Chief Superintendent Novlett Robyn Williams, 54, a highly decorated officer, commended for her work in the aftermath of the Grenfell disaster, had denied ever seeing the clip that was sent to her by her sister, Jennifer Hodge, 56, via WhatsApp in February 2018.Â </p>
      <p>But prosecutors said there was no way the senior Met officer could have missed the 54 second clip which featured a child aged around five-years-old engaging in a sex act with a man.</p>
      <p>Williams showed no emotion as the jury convicted her of possessing an indecent video of a child.</p>
      <p>She was cleared of an additional charge of corruption, but now faces a discipline inquiry and the possibility of being thrown out of the force.</p>
      <p>Williams was awarded the Queen's Police Medal and had been praised for helping to raise the profile of black female officers.</p>
      <p>She was honoured by the Queen for her senior role during the 2011 London riots and again for helping Grenfell victims in 2017.</p>
      <p>The trial heard how Williams had been one of 17 people to be sent the video, which had been forwarded from her sister's partner, bus driver, Dido Massivi.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claimed Williams knew from the thumbnail of the clip what had been sent to her and she had a duty to delete it and report her sister.</p>
      <p>But she insisted the video had escaped her attention because she was at a dance class when it was sent.</p>

      <p>Richard Wright, prosecuting, told jurors it was not suggested that Williams, Hodge or Massivi had any sexual interest in the video or had any "sinister purpose" in having or sharing it.</p>
      <p>He said: "This is instead a case in which we allege that each of them made serious errors of judgment about how to handle this video and, in dealing with it as they did, each of them has committed serious criminal offences."</p>
      <p>Hodge was convicted of distributing an indecent image while Massivi was convicted of distributing an indecent photograph of a child and possession of extreme pornography.</p>
      <p>All three will be sentenced next week.</p>
      <p>Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matthew Horne said: "The prosecution called this a 'sad case' and referred to the 'serious errors of judgment' made by those involved.</p>
      <p>"The court heard that Supt Williams has led a distinguished career in policing and previously been commended for her professionalism.</p>
      <p>"The Independent Office for Police Conduct is carrying out an independent misconduct investigation into the actions of Supt Williams and we await the outcome."</p>
      <p>Williams remains on restricted duties, Scotland Yard said.</p>
