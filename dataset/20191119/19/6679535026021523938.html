      <p>With the commitment to ensure full access to the physically-challenged, police stations in the district have turned disabled-friendly, showing that they are doing more than just paying lip service.</p>
      <p>Earlier, ramps had been constructed in all the police stations as part of the provisions of Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. However, they did little to address the problems of disabled persons, who struggled to get on the ramp while entering a police station.</p>
      <p>Noticing their plight, Commissioner of Police V.B. Kamalasan Reddy decided to provide wheelchairs to all the 18 police stations in the district. Each wheelchair was purchased at a cost of ₹4,000 and the police personnel were directed to ensure that the disabled were not put to any physical inconvenience.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>The Hindu </i>on Tuesday, the Commissioner of Police said, “It is minimum courtesy to help the disabled persons visiting the police stations. We have provided wheelchairs to all the police stations so that the personnel at the station would help the disabled persons sit in the wheelchair and reach the SI and Inspector comfortably.”</p>
      <p>Besides, police officials would also assist the disabled persons in writing the complaints, he added. “The wheelchairs are not just for the disabled persons; even if a pregnant woman or an elderly person comes to the police station, they can make use of it to get to the SHOs,” he maintained.</p>
      <p>What’s more, the police stations have also turned environment-friendly as single-use plastic is banned on the premises and sapling plantation is taken up on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>The police stations are well equipped with fire safety mechanism too, Mr. Reddy stated. Next on the to-do list is distribution of tea-making machines to all stations for the benefit of those on duty and also for the visitors.</p>
