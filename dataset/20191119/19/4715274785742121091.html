      <p>The Department of Energy officially awarded to PetroGreen Energy Corp. of the  Yuchengco Group a service contract to develop a wind project in San Vicente, Palawan province.</p>
      <p>The wind energy service contract, which took effect October 9 and received by PGEC on November 11, grants the company with the rights and responsibilities to harness wind energy and develop and operate the corresponding renewable energy facility in the area.</p>
      <p>The proposed project is situated in the municipality of San Vicente, Palawan, approximately 130 kilometers north of Puerto Princesa.</p>
      <p>“The eco-tourism growth in San Vicente and adjoining towns, the lack of reliable power supply, and the strong support by the provincial and municipal governments for environment-friendly energy facilities drive our decision to invest in San Vicente, Palawan,” said PGEC deputy chief operating officer Maria Victoria Olivar.</p>
      <p>“With the award of the service contract, we will proceed with our feasibility studies to ascertain the commercial viability of the block,” she said. </p>
