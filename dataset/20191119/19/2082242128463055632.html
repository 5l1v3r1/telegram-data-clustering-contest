      <h3><a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/toronto-maple-leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> at Vegas Goldem Knights<br/>Watch on: TSN4, Altitude Sports, NHL.tv at 10 pm</h3>

      <p>The Toronto Maple Leafs have been saying that this road trip was an important one. That it will give the team time to bond in a way that they’ve been unable to in Toronto. The team (well, most of it) has been in Vegas since their Saturday night loss to the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/pittsburgh-penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/246225/pierre-engvall">Pierre Engvall</a> joined the team after their practice yesterday afternoon, being recalled from the Toronto Marlies as <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/283115/trevor-moore">Trevor Moore</a> was placed on IR and is set to make his NHL debut tonight.</p>

      <p>The Knights are riding high, coming off a 6-0 victory over the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/calgary-flames">Calgary Flames</a> on Sunday night, ending a five game losing streak that began with a 2-1 overtime loss to the Maple Leafs.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p>After starting out November with three straight wins, the Maple Leafs have now lost five in a row and pushed Leafs Nation to a level of despair not seen since Ron Wilson was coaching the team. A chance to get away from it all and being able to focus on nothing but hockey can hopefully help them get things back on track. If not, something needs to happen.</p>
