      <p>The Court of Appeal, Sokoto Division, on Tuesday reserved judgement in the appeal filed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) Governorship Candidate in the state, Ahmad Aliyu.</p>
      <p>Mr Aliyu is challenging the Governorship Election Tribunal judgement that affirmed the election of Governor Aminu Tambuwal of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the March 9 governorship election in the state.</p>
      <p>The election was declared inconclusive following cancellation of 75, 403 votes which were higher than the 3, 413 votes margin between the leading candidates.</p>
      <p>A re-run was held on March 23, which led to the victory of Tambuwal who won with a slim margin of 342 votes.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the tribunal on October 2, in Abuja affirmed the election of Tambuwal.</p>
      <p>The three-man tribunal led by Justice Abbas Bawale dismissed the petition of the APC and its governorship candidate, for lacking in merit.</p>
      <p>Unsatisfied with the judgement Aliyu, on October 16, filed a notice of Appeal challenging the judgement of the lower court, seeking the court to set aside the tribunal judgement and declared him as the winner of the election.</p>
      <p>The four-man panel of Justice led by Justice Hussein Mukhtar, reserved judgement in the appeal.</p>
      <p>The Presiding Justice said the judgment will be ready in a short frame of time and the court will communicate when it is ready.</p>
