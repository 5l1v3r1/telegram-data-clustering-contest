      <h1>China has saved hundreds of thousands of lives by reducing air pollution, study says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:22:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:22</time> by <a rel="author">Jack Guy, CNN</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://cnn.com/2019/03/04/asia/beijing-smog-two-sessions-intl/index.html">China's</a> raft of clean <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/07/10/asia/china-wuhan-pollution-problems-intl-hnk/index.html">air policies</a> saved hundreds of thousands of lives in 2017 alone, according to new research.</p>
      <p>Fine particle pollution declined rapidly following the implementation of new rules on industrial emissions and the promotion of clean fuels, according to the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/11/12/1907956116">study</a>, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS).</p>
      <p>The study, which focused on the period from 2013-2017, was conducted by a group of Chinese researchers and scientists.</p>
      <p>PM2.5 particulate matter, as this kind of pollution is known, is so small that it can enter the bloodstream, potentially leading to cancer, stroke and heart attack in the long term.</p>
      <p><a href="https://cnn.com/2011/11/17/world/asia/china-beijing-air-pollution/index.html">After rapid industrialization</a> and weak regulations left the country with a reputation for smog and bad air quality, Chinese authorities started to take air pollution seriously in 2008.</p>
      <p>In 2013, Beijing had PM2.5 concentrations 40 times higher than levels recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), and the government introduced its toughest-ever clean air policies that year.</p>
      <p>The study found "significant declines" in PM2.5 levels across China from 2013-2017, coinciding with new standards for thermal power plants and industrial boilers, the replacement of old factories, and new emissions rules for vehicles.</p>
      <p>While the weather can also influence PM2.5 concentrations, the study found it had relatively little impact for the period of the study.</p>
      <p>The authors say this "confirms the effectiveness of China's recent clean air actions."</p>
      <p>These recent actions have seen Beijing fall out of the top 100 most-polluted cities in Asia in recent years, with overall pollution levels 10 per cent lower across Chinese cities between 2017 and 2018, <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/21193/latest-air-pollution-data-ranks-worlds-cities-worst-to-best/">according to a report by Greenpeace and AirVisual.</a></p>
      <p>Shanghai, the country's largest city and financial capital, has also made environmental advances, such as adopting stringent recycling regulations.</p>
      <p>Despite some advances, China still has a huge problem to deal with, and citizens are taking action.</p>
      <p>Public pressure has been the driving force of pollution policy in China, and a spate of protests around the issue have occurred in recent years.</p>
      <p>However, the government is facing an uneasy balancing act: it must handle the public's environmental concerns but avoid taking action that would slow growth, all while dealing with an economy that has already expanded rapidly -- often without the safety and emissions standards people are now demanding.</p>
      <p>Air pollution is a global issue, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/04/health/most-polluted-cities-india-china-intl/index.html">India is now home to 22 of the 30 </a>most polluted world cities, according to the Greenpeace/AirVisual report.</p>
      <p>In the U.S., a recent study said air pollution was linked to more than <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/04/08/health/particle-pollution-study/index.html">107,000 premature deaths in 2011 and cost the country $866 billion.</a></p>
