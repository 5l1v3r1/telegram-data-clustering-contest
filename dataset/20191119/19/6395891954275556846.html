      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - A federal judge in Massachusetts has dismissed a $3 billion lawsuit accusing Wynn Resorts of cheating to win its casino license for Encore Boston Harbor.</p>
      <p>U.S. District Court Chief Judge Patti Saris says Sterling Suffolk Racecourse's allegations do not constitute racketeering violations under the federal RICO act.</p>
      <p>Sterling Suffolk says it's "exploring all its options." Wynn Resorts declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Sterling Suffolk proposed building a Mohegan Sun casino on the Suffolk Downs horse track in Boston.</p>
      <p>It argued Wynn Resorts fraudulently obtained its license through "unlawful methods," including kickbacks, political cronyism, and concealing allegations of sexual misconduct against company founder Steve Wynn.</p>
      <p>Massachusetts fined the company $35.5 million for failing to disclose the allegations but allowed it to keep its license.</p>
      <p>Steve Wynn resigned as CEO but denies the allegations against him.</p>
