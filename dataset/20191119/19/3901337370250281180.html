      <p>On Monday, <i>AS</i> revealed a list of 11 of the most valuable players currently struggling to find first-team action. The Spanish publication considered the players' market values and minutes played to formulate a starting XI of the most valuable benchwarmers in the game.</p>
      <p>FC Barcelona's Neto, who is the club's back-up goalkeeper to Marc-Andre ter Stegen, takes his place in goal with zero minutes to his name this season, despite carrying a reported €18 million (R293 million) market value.</p>

      <p>He is joined by Borussia Dortmund's Dan-Axel Zagadou and Juventus duo Daniele Rugani and Merih Demiral, who form a three-man defence. The trio have a combined market value of €65 million (R1 billion), but have played less than 400 minutes of football between them this season.  </p>
      <p>In midfield, Emre Can, who is valued at €33 million (R537 million), joins his Juve teammates in the XI and marshals the centre of the park alongside Manchester City wonderkid Phil Foden, Barcelona youngster Carles Alena and Red Bull Leipzig flyer Ademola Lookman.</p>
      <p>The team of benchwarmers is rounded up by a three-pronged attack that includes Real Madrid striker Mariano Diaz, who has not put foot to pitch this season. The €20 million (R326 million) star is flanked in attack by AC Milan's on-loan forward Ante Rebic and Chelsea super-sub Michy Batshuayi.</p>
