      <p>Tom Brady wasn’t happy with the Patriots’ 17-10 win over the Eagles on Sunday, but Bill Belichick sure was.</p>
      <p>The usually stoic New England coach smirked and declared a “Victory Monday” this week, giving his squad a few days off to celebrate their AFC East-leading 9-1 record.</p>
      <p>While Brady <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/tom-brady-cant-hide-his-anger-with-the-patriots-offense/">stewed about the Pats’ offensive troubles</a> in the Week 11 win, Belichick was able to extract a measure of revenge on Lane Johnson. The Philadelphia tackle told media after his team’s 2018 Super Bowl win over New England that it didn’t look like Patriots players had any fun.</p>
      <p>“It looked like everyone had fun out there today,” Belichick said <a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/11/patriots-bill-belichick-has-fun-trolling-eagles">in his postgame presser</a>.</p>
      <p>The Pats are cruising toward an 11th straight division title, and their curmudgeonly coach seems to be enjoying this run.</p>
