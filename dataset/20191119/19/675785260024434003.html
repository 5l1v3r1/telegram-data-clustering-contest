      <p>A lorry carrying 25 migrants in a refrigerated container has been found on a ferry travelling from the Netherlands to England.</p>
      <p>Crew members were said to have discovered the migrants in a cool room on board the cargo ship.</p>
      <p>It is believed there is a child among the migrants, although this is yet to be confirmed.</p>
      <p>Emergency services flocked to the Britannia Seaways ferry which had departed from Vlaardingen this evening.</p>
      <p>Up to 20 ambulances have been sent to the Vulcaanhaven port where the cargo ship has returned, <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2311161-26-verstekelingen-in-koelcontainer-op-veerboot-vlaardingen.html">NOS reports.</a></p>
      <p>The migrants on board are all believed to be alive and receiving medical treatment.</p>
      <p>Two people have been sent to hospital for extra care.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the other 23 are being taken away by police 'for processing,' according to a statement posted on the website of regional emergency services.</p>

      <p>The migrants were aboard a Britannia Seaways ferry owned by Danish operator DFDS that had just embarked on a run across the North Sea to Felixstowe in southern England.</p>
      <p>Sniffer dogs were said to be used to comb the vessel for other possible stowaways.</p>
      <p>"The crew discovered after a few kilometers that people were on board," a police spokesman told <a href="https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/991406699/hulpdiensten-rukken-uit-voor-verstekelingen-aan-boord-schip-vlaardingen">De Telegraaf.</a></p>
      <p>It turned around immediately and is now back at the harbour.</p>
      <p>It remains unclear how the migrants came to be on board or what their nationalities are.</p>
      <p>"Emergency services are reporting about 26 people," a statement posted on the local government website said. "Word from the ship is that no one died."</p>
      <p>Their conditions remain unknown.</p>
      <p>On October 23, 39 bodies, all believed to be Vietnamese migrants, were discovered in the back of a refrigerated truck near London.</p>
      <p>Two people have been charged in Britain and eight in Vietnam over the deaths.</p>
      <p>The container in which the bodies were found had arrived on a ferry from Zeebrugge in Belgium.</p>
