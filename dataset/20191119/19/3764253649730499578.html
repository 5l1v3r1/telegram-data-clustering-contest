      <p>The All Progressive Congress (APC) has cautioned the Independent National Electoral Commission (NEC) to be wary of certain election observers who sought financial inducement in the performance of their duty.</p>
      <p>The party was reacting to several calls by independent election observers for the electoral body to cancel the Kogi governorship election.</p>
      <p>The APC described the observers as <b>'corrupt elements,' </b>accused them of taking the position, because it refused to dance to their tunes.</p>
      <p>In a statement sent to journaists on Tuesday, November 18, the spokesperson of the APC campaign council, Kingsley Fanwo, stated that it was out of place to adopt a general evaluation of events with reported incidences of violence in some areas.</p>

      <p>He asserted that some observers instead of going to the field to monitor the exercise thronged the houses of candidates for logistics to give a favourable report of the elections.</p>
      <p>The party spokesperson affirmed that as a government they were not bothered by the damning reports by the obsevers.</p>
      <p>He opined that true and genuine observation of elections was geared towards pointing areas where electoral umpire or security agents needed to improve in future elections</p>
      <p>He said the observers should hide their faces in shame, calling them<b> 'cash and carry observers.'</b></p>

      <p>Recall that the Centre for Transparency Advocacy (CTA) called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276549-kogi-election-cta-calls-cancellation-poll-widespread-violence-vote-buying.html">cancel Saturday's governorship election in Kogi state.</a></p>
      <p>The group made the call hours after a civil society organisation, YIAGA AFRICA, alleged that the credibility of Kogi elections has been compromised by political parties and security agencies and as a result <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276507-kogi-elections-yiaga-calls-cancellation-excercise.html">called for the cancellation of the polls.</a></p>
