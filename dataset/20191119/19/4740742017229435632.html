      <p>A driver has been charged with causing serious injury by dangerous driving following an incident in which man was left with horrific injuries.</p>
      <p>Ed Bowen was pinned to a wall by a car as it was driven backwards down a steep hill in Bristol last October.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/appeal-launched-hero-crushed-saved-2214627">34-year-old told</a> how he had pushed his girlfriend out of the way of the car and was then crushed by the back of it.</p>
      <p>He went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated in the ambulance rushing him to hospital. He underwent an 11-hour operation to save his life. He had to have his left leg amputated and also suffered other serious injuries, from which he is still recovering.</p>
      <p>Mr Bowen was hailed a hero for his actions, and a <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/update-man-who-lost-leg-2326495">fundraising page set up by his friends</a> as he lay in hospital went viral, and raised more than Â£12,000 for him and his girlfriend Nicola Boraston.</p>
      <p>Now, a man has been charged with causing those serious injuries through dangerous driving.</p>
