      <p>OTTUMWA, Iowa — Auto workers across the Midwest are gearing up for the Iowa caucuses.</p>
      <p>A former employee of a recently-closed General Motors (GM) plant is hoping to drum up support for Senator Bernie Sanders in Ottumwa on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Chuckie Denison, of Lake Milton, Ohio, is a third generation auto worker. He’s one of roughly 1,500 who lost their jobs after the GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio closed its doors in March.</p>
      <p>“That one separated my family," Denison said. “I’m tired of seeing communities devastated, families devastated. The ripple effect it has on the supply chain for that manufacturer, to the first responders, to schools, to the children who are at school to learn.”</p>
      <p>Denison has spent the past year advocating for the rights of workers by participating in protests against his former employer.</p>
      <p>“Collectively, we all have a voice," he said. "What corporations are doing is immoral and we all have a civic duty to stand up for our communities."</p>
      <p>Denison added that the outcome of the 2020 presidential election will shape the future of the working class.</p>
      <p>“I do not want to see Iowans go through what Ohioans did," Denison said. "There’s a solution to corporate greed. And that is Bernie Sanders's policies: to cut off federal contracts to these corporations that are offshoring manufacturing jobs.”</p>
      <p>Denison and United Auto Workers (UAW) in Iowa are asking working citizens to consider such policies when deciding who to vote for.</p>
      <p>“He (Bernie Sanders) easily has the most comprehensive labor policy in the history of any presidential candidate," said UAW Local 74 President Chris Laursen.</p>
      <p>Denison is scheduled to meet with voters in Ottumwa 6 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 21 at UFCW Local 230 (1305 east Mary St.). Thursday's "Labor for Bernie" event is open to the public.</p>
