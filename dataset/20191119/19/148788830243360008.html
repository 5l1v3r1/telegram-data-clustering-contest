      <p>It’s time for yet another very attractive person to accept a <i>Mission</i> (or two). <b>Pom Klementieff</b>, who plays Mantis in the <b><i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> </b>franchise and was recently seen in the new season of <i>Black Mirror</i>, has joined the <b><i>Mission: Impossible 7</i></b> and <b><i>8</i></b> casts, according to director <b>Christopher McQuarrie</b>. Specifics of Klementieff’s role have yet to be revealed, but we’re guessing it will involve tons of kicking, punching, and of course, running. Lots and lots of running.</p>

      <p>Meet the latest <i>Mission: Impossible</i> femme fatale: Pom Klementieff. McQuarrie referring to Klementieff as a “femme fatale” in the tweet above suggests her character will be a potential villain, or at least someone with shady allegiances. <b>Rebecca Ferguson</b>‘s Ilsa Faust was definitely a femme fatale when she joined the series, but she’s turned into an honorary member of the team at this point.</p>
      <p>McQuarrie is shooting <i>Mission: Impossible 7</i> and <i>8</i> back-to-back. <b>Tom Cruise</b> will return as Ethan Hunt, because of course he will. Rebecca Ferguson is back as well, and it’s safe to assume <b>Simon Pegg</b> and <b>Ving Rhames</b> will show up at some point. And hey, maybe Wolf Blitzer will come back, too! (Probably not, though.) Klementieff isn’t the only new addition to the franchise, though. <b>Hayley Atwell</b> is also set to appear in both films.</p>
      <p>Plot details about the next two <i>Missions</i> are currently underwraps, but the franchise has built up a lot of goodwill and become a must-see, especially with McQuarrie at the helm. <i>Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation</i>, McQuarrie’s first time directing a <i>Mission</i>, was phenomenal, and his follow-up, <i>Mission: Impossible – Fallout</i> was one of the most thrilling action movies in recent memory. In short, as long as he’s making these movies, they’re worth getting excited about.</p>
      <p>“I pitched the idea of making two movies, and now I have to justify why it’s two movies,” McQuarrie told tells <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/mission-impossible-7-8-will-wallow-last-three-movies-whole-says-christopher-mcqu/">Empire</a>. “You’ve got to earn that. You’ve got to make something that swallows the last three movies whole. I’m freaked out now. We’ve talked ourselves into something. Holy shit.”</p>
      <p><i>Mission: Impossible 7</i> opens <b>July 23, 2021</b> and <i>Mission: Impossible 8</i> arrives <b>August 5, 2022</b>.</p>
