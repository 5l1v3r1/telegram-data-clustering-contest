        <b>Roblox lets you build just about anything, and naturally players have been making Star Wars stuff pretty much from the jump – but now, that crossover is becoming official. Just in time for The Rise of Skywalker, a new Star Wars-themed creator challenge will hit Roblox alongside a selection of items from the films.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Galactic Speedway Creator Challenge begins on November 19 and lasts until January 6. The event asks you to build a driftspeeder which you can race against other players online, and joins Roblox’s lineup of free content aimed at teaching kids coding, modeling, and game scripting.</p>
      <p>Completing the lessons in the creator challenge will get you Rey’s staff, a Stormtrooper helmet, and a Rise of Skywalker baseball cap, as well as a pair of droid companions – BB-8 and D-O. Separately, Kylo Ren’s reforged helmet will also be available to all Roblox players. You can get more details on everything via the <a href="https://roblox.com/theriseofskywalkercreatorchallenge">official site</a>.</p>
      <p>You can also see a bit more in the trailer below.</p>
