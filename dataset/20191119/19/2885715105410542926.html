      <p>During the review meeting at his office, the CM expressed deep concern over the deaths and issued instructions to the Collectors of Jaipur, Nagaur and Ajmer through video conferencing, asking officials to take all necessary steps.</p>
      <p>The CM directed officials to gather details of similar incidents at the national and international level for further analysis and suggest the future course of action, saying that this could help avert such crises effectively and promote conservation of birds in the future.</p>
