      <p>Everton and Manchester City have been credited with an interest in Hoffenheim midfielder Dennis Geiger.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sport1.de/fussball/uefa-u21-em-2019/2019/11/dennis-geiger-von-der-tsg-hoffenheim-weckt-interesse-der-topklubs">According to Sport1</a>, the defensive midfielder has caught the eye this term with some solid performances, with City boss Pep Guardiola said to be a big fan of his.</p>

      <p>Geiger has been a first-teamer at Hoffenheim since 2017 after coming through the club’s academy, and he has represented Germany at all youth levels.</p>
      <p>It is thought that Bayern Munich are also impressed by Geiger, with the 21-year-old having recently shone against them in the Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>The promising youngster is under contract at Hoffenheim until 2022 and there has been no word on any kind of release clause.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Everton surely a better option</h3>
      <p>Guardiola may be a big fan, but he only recently splashed the cash on Rodri.</p>
      <p>Fernandinho may not have much longer left at the Etihad, but Ilkay Gundogan can also play as a holding midfielder.</p>

      <p>Geiger, who can also be of use as a number eight, would seemingly be better off going to Everton if he was to soon move.</p>
      <p>Regular minutes would likely be easier to come by at Goodison Park, with the club arguably in need of upgrading on Morgan Schneiderlin.</p>
      <p>And of course, Andre Gomes is out for the foreseeable.</p>
