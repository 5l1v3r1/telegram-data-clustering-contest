      <p>A pedophile raped three sister aged four, six and eight years-old while their mother was out on an errand, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>George Lamar Sanders, 24, had charges against him upgraded to three counts of first-degree rape on Tuesday, four months after he was first arrested.</p>
      <p>Sanders, of Prattville in Alabama, had previously been charged with one count of first-degree rape and three counts of sexual abuse of a child under 12.</p>
      <p>He has also been charged with three counts of enticing a child to enter a room for immoral purposes.</p>
      <p>Sanders, who worked as a firefighter and Burger King server before setting up a towing business, reportedly attacked the girls while their mother was out visiting a friend.</p>

      <p>The woman and her family have now moved out of the home where the attack took place.</p>
      <p>Autauga County Sheriff Joe Sedinger says his deputies fear Sanders could have more victims.</p>
      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/crime/2019/11/19/montgomery-man-faces-additional-child-sex-charges-autauga/4237935002/">Montgomery Advertiser</a>: ‘This is a very disturbing case, because of the ages of the victims.</p>
      <p>‘We have continued to investigate since it was first reported.</p>
      <p>‘Through our investigation, we have reason to believe other victims are out there.’</p>
      <p>Sheriff Sedinger said his team were specially trained to help child victims of sex abuse, and that victims could speak to a female member of his staff.</p>
      <p>Sanders has been held in Autauga Metro Jail since he was arrested in July, with his bond amount now increased from $90,000 to $270,000.</p>
