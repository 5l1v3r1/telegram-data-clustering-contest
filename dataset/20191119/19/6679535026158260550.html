      <p>Tourism Minister Avanti Srinivas on Tuesday said that the tourist boat operators have to apply for licences afresh, since the government will make it mandatory for them to undergo training in sailing and route survey in river water resources.</p>
      <p>Disclosing the details of the meeting held at Secretariat, the minister said that there were more than 300 private boats, and 54 boats under the A.P. Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC). The boat operators would have to obtain the fitness certificate and the helmsmen have to undergo the training, he added.</p>
      <p>The minister said the inspection of the boats was going on, and half of the boats were examined for fitness. The permissions would be granted only after Ports Authority gave clearances. An 18-day training will be imparted to the helmsmen and the licence will be issued only if the helmsmen passed in the training.</p>
      <p>The examinations will be conducted at Kakinada on December 10. The government plans to set up 9 control rooms for the administration/maintenance of the boats. A team headed by revenue official of MRO cadre and officials from tourism, police, disaster management, water resources will function from each control room. Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy will inaugurate a control room at Mummadivaram on November 21, he added.</p>
