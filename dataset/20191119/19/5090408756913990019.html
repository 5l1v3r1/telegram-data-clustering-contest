      <ul>
        <li>A neighborhood of abandoned streetcars turned into homes and businesses once existed in early-20th-century San Francisco.</li>
        <li>Carville, or Carville-by-the-Sea or Cartown, was built when the city sold its outdated horse-drawn trolley cars for under $20, which is about $600 in today’s dollars, and their new owners set them up in the city’s Sunset District.</li>
        <li>The village became an epicenter of San Francisco bohemia until developers and realtors came hunting for more housing space.</li>
        <li>Here’s what it was like in Carville around 1900.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>San Francisco’s neighborhoods have long been turned inside out, seeing transformation after transformation as housing demand in the region increases with each passing decade.</p>
      <p>That might go back further than we think – around 1900, a neighborhood called Carville existed, constructed out of the city’s outdated and discarded horse-drawn trolley cars.</p>
      <p>There were restaurants, club houses, homes, and more in the tiny-home village, and it became an epicenter for bohemians of 20th-century San Francisco.</p>
      <p>But as the years went by and the city’s population continued to balloon, realtors and developers looked to Carville as a means to cash in on new housing that was “real.”</p>
      <p>Here’s what it was like in Carville before the neighborhood gradually faded away.</p>
