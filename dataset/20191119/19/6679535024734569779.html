      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:44:59+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Rasika-Bhale-103385/" target="_blank">Rasika Bhale</a></address>
      <p>In a rapidly-evolving maritime sector, attention needs to be paid to the safety of seafarers, said Vice Admiral R.B. Pandit, Chief of Staff of the Western Naval Command.</p>
      <p>Vice Admiral Pandit was speaking at a day-long seminar on Maritime Safety at INHS Asvini in Navy Nagar recently. It was jointly organised by the Western Naval Command, the Indian Maritime Foundation and the Nautical Institute, U.K. The annual seminar was started in 2011 with the aim of bringing the Indian Navy, the Merchant Navy, the Coast Guard and seafarers under one umbrella to discuss the difficulties faced while at sea.</p>

      <p>Vice Admiral Pandit said, “India since time immemorial has had a rich seafaring legacy, which means our ports were always busy places, receiving ships from many parts of the world. Therefore, the safety and security of ships, cargo and personnel was always a priority. Today, the maritime community is multifaceted and evolving. The seas will sustain our development, which makes maritime safety a crucial factor.” Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s launch of the Sagarmala initiative in 2015, he said Mr. Modi had a clear maritime vision. The Sagarmala initiative focuses on unlocking the potential of waterways and the coastline to minimise infrastructural investments.</p>
      <p>Retired Indian Navy Commodore Ajay Chitnis, vice president of the Indian Maritime Foundation, also spoke on the need for safety measures. “There is an increasing need to discuss maritime safety and the measures that are to be taken on board a vessel. Enhancing safety on board means coming up with solutions to a variety of problems faced by our mariners,” Mr. Chitnis said.</p>
      <h3>Expansion plans</h3>
      <p>The Indian Maritime Foundation was founded as a non-profit organisation in 1993 by officers of the Indian Navy and the Indian Merchant Marines. Nicolas Nash, president of the Nautical Institute, said junior officers are being encouraged to serve at sea.</p>
      <p>Mr. Nash said, “Today, we are a group of more than 7,000 officers across 50 branches of the marines in over 100 nations. By 2022, as we reach our 50th year, we hope to expand further.”</p>
