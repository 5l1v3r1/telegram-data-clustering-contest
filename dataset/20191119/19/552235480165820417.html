      <h1>Prince and the paedo is just latest grim royal tale but it may help sink House of Windsor</h1>
      <h2>Annie Brown hopes Prince Andrew scandal will help shatter the illusion on which the very institution of royalty depends.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:56:18+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:56</time> by <a rel="author">Annie Brown, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/annie-brown/</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew’s associates are dropping him faster than a guillotine falling on the chopping block.</p>
      <p>Huddersfield University where he is chancellor wants him gone and sponsors of his charities are withdrawing their backing of his charitable organisations.</p>
      <p>Students at the university say he is now not a good role model, which, oddly, implies he once was.</p>
      <p>Sponsors such as city giant KPMG, which has paid millions in fines for doctoring audits, don’t want Andrew adding to their stink, so that’s how fetid he is.</p>
      <p>The only place Andrew would be welcome right now is at FBI HQ and that’s exactly where he would be if he had even a modicum of sympathy for Epstein’s victims.</p>
      <p>If there is any silver lining in this cloud of murk hanging over Andrew it should be the shattering of the illusion on which the very institution of royalty depends.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>This scandal comes at such a cost – to the young trafficked women, abused by licentious reprobates who have damaged them beyond repair.</p>
      <p>The latest victim to come forward accused Jeffrey Epstein of sexually abusing her as a 15-year-old, and she has asked Prince Andrew to share information on his former buddy.</p>
      <p>It feels almost glib to be talking about anything but the victims here but surely this is a moment to wake up from the stupor of sycophancy this country has been in.</p>
      <p>It’s time to tell the emperor he is stark, bollock naked.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew didn’t bring disgrace to the Royal Family, he just added to it and putrid though he may be, the bigger rot is the institution itself.</p>
      <p>Throughout Britain’s history, royals have been murderers, despots and thieves yet still they have been rewarded and revered.</p>
      <p>You have to hand it to them, it’s been one helluva scam.</p>
      <p>Any other family would be airbrushing such ancestry out but the royals hang portraits of their notorious forebears in the palaces , which the rest of us mugs queue to see.</p>
      <p>The royals are a picture postcard portrayal of a Britain that doesn’t exist, a worthless tourist trinket touted as diamonds. Their lands, their riches, the very institution, is built on the back of exploitation and dirty dealing and if they really were a firm, they would have been closed down long before now.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>It is damaging to any society to hold up as worthy an institution built on the assumption of one person’s worth over another’s.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/prince-andrew-denies-underage-sex-20897761">may claim not to sweat</a> but the plebs who built his ermine-lined world of grandeur certainly did.</p>
      <p>Now he is also accused of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/breaking-prince-andrew-accused-using-20906500">using the N-word</a> , a claim that he denies – but Prince Philip has been openly racist for years and the response has been little more than a collective eye roll.</p>
      <p>Andrew hasn’t had full-time paid job since he left the Royal Navy in 2001 but it costs a lot of money to sustain a man so worthless.</p>
      <p>He manages to keep a spacious home in Windsor and a £13million chalet in Verbier.</p>
      <p>He lives in Royal Lodge, a house in Windsor Great Park which he spent £7.5million doing up, and it is a mystery how he finances any of it but we can be sure of our contribution.</p>
      <p>We can hope – but there is little doubt this will all blow over as the reason <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/prince-andrew-says-pizza-express-20898964">Prince Andrew</a> thought he could act with impunity is because, sadly, he can.</p>

      <h3>Boris Johnson set to be caught in blast after Jennifer Arcuri 'snub'</h3>
      <p>There are moments in British politics right now which feel like there might be hallucinogenics in the water.</p>
      <p>The normalisation of the bizarre continued this week as the American businesswoman at the centre of a controversy with Boris Johnson did a round of interviews.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Arcuri’s links with the PM came under scrutiny over allegations she received favourable treatment for her business ventures during his stint as London mayor.</p>
      <p>Arcuri was very upset BoJo won’t now take her calls.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She said she had been under pressure to “admit the affair” but won’t confirm an affair. She denied she had been shown favourable treatment but said the two used to speak on the phone all the time and she felt like she could talk to Johnson “about anything”.</p>
      <p>Arcuri said she had called Johnson but a man took the phone from him and “was pretending to speak in a Chinese accent...otherwise, F off”. Addressing BoJo directly, Arcuri said: “I’ve been nothing but loyal, faithful, supportive and a true confidante of yours. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/boris-johnson-cast-jennifer-arcuri-20897390">I’ve kept your secrets</a> and I’ve been your friend.”</p>
      <p>In womenspeak, Chinese or otherwise, this means Arcuri has just pulled the pin and the grenade is about to land on BoJo. Now sit back and enjoy.</p>

      <h3>Homophobic minister Richard Cameron should apologise</h3>
      <p>Good that the Church of Scotland decided to suspend homophobic minister Richard Cameron but a pity their arm had to be twisted.</p>
      <p>Cameron made Islamophobic and homophobic comments on social media as far back as June – so why has it taken until now?</p>
      <p>Cameron publicly heckled Jeremy Corbyn <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/jeremy-corbyn-hecklers-pulpit-ban-20902889">during a visit to Scotstoun</a> last Wednesday, calling him a “terrorist sympathiser” and the church had no choice but to act.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>His replacement told his congregation Cameron has not been “found guilty of any wrongdoing” and he has the church’s “compassion and grace”.</p>
      <p>Contrite Cameron is not –and has stood by his Twitter comments that “gays” are perverts and only Christ can “defeat” Islam.</p>
      <p>Well, may God forgive him because until he apologises, no one else should.</p>
