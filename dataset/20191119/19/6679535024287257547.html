      <h1>Looking to make driving tests more efficient</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:38:44+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:38</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The increasing number of vehicles and the outdated method of testing driving skills of applicants have been blamed for the State recording high number of accidents. There are also complaints about RTOs not stringently assessing the written or skill tests of the applicants, like in foreign countries, where both tests are assessed to high standards. The complaint that applicants going through driving schools normally get licences without much hastle, also continues.</p>
      <h3>Simulators planned</h3>
      <p>Taking these complaints into consideration, the State Transport Autority is planning to install simulators in the coming years. A simulator would be used for assessing driving skills of the applicants and they would then be made to showcase their driving skills in natural conditions.</p>
      <p>Regarding lax assessment of written tests for LLR applicants and the advantage of going through driving schools, the official said the monitoring system for applicants through driving schools had been made stricter. He said: “Applicants of driving schools would have to attend a minimum number of classes, both theory and practical ones, for which finger printing machines are set to be installed and directly linked to RTOs. The fixing of finger printing machines have already been carried out, on a trial basis, in driving schools attached to RTO South.”</p>
