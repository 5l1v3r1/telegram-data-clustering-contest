      <h1>Hacked Disney+ Accounts are Being Sold on the Dark Web</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:30:04+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/chris-evangelista/" target="_blank">Chris Evangelista</a></address>
      <p><b>Disney+</b> is one of the cheapest streaming services out there, but that hasn’t stopped people from selling hacked Disney+ accounts for even cheaper on the dark web. According to a new report, <i>thousands</i> of hacked Disney+ accounts are already for sale. In fact, hacked accounts were available for sale on hacking forums within mere hours of the Disney+ launch.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/">ZDnet</a> is reporting that thousands of Disney+ accounts have been hacked and are already up for sale on the location of the second <i>Unfriended</i> movie – the dark web. The <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50461171">BBC</a> launched its own investigation piggybacking off of ZDnet and confirmed the same. There are even screenshots.</p>

      <p>Jason Hill, a lead researcher with CyberInt, tells the BBC that accounts were stolen primarily “because people use the same passwords for different sites.” Hill adds that hackers “can lift someone’s password from a different site which has previously been hacked and then try it on a new site, like Disney+. If it works, they steal the account.”</p>
      <p>“Whilst many may consider having a unique password for each online service to be difficult to manage, password managers simplify this process and allow you to generate and securely store unique difficult-to-guess passwords,” Hill said. Disney+ currently does not have two-factor authentication, a method they might want to consider looking into to avoid this.</p>
      <p>What makes this all the more strange is that Disney+ is relatively cheap. It’s currently only $7, and while some hacked accounts are being sold for $3, others are going for as much as $11. That’s <i>more</i> money than a non-stolen account. That said, ZDnet also adds that they found several hacked Disney+ accounts being offered to the hacker community for free.</p>
      <p>Disney+ had technical problems the moment it launched. Those issues seem to have been resolved by now, but dealing with hacked accounts is a whole new headache. We’ve reached out to Disney+ for a comment on the matter and will update when and if they reply.</p>
