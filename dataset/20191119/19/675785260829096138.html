      <h1>Alison Phillips: I bet arrogant, narcissist Prince Andrew is really sweating now...</h1>
      <h2>Prince Andrew is facing the prospect of being drummed to the wilderness fringe of the royal family</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:25:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:25</time> by <a rel="author">Alison Phillips, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/alison-phillips/</a></address>
      <p>Sixteen years ago this ­newspaper sent reporter Ryan Parry to work undercover as a footman at ­Buckingham palace.</p>
      <p>His reports stunned the nation. Not only did we discover the Queen kept her Cornflakes in a ­Tupperware container and two different types of marmalade were served at breakfast... we also discovered what our royalty were really like.</p>
      <p>Ryan’s stories about Prince Andrew have stayed with me ever since.</p>
      <p>The Queen’s ‘favourite’ son was infamous among staff for his abrasive and demanding attitude.</p>
      <p>Even royal protection officers stood well back as he screeched through the main palace gates in his Aston Martin.</p>
      <p>And each morning a footman woke him up at 7.30am with his ‘calling tray’ – a pot of tea with a china cup and saucer. One of them told Ryan: “The response can as easily be ‘f*** off’ as ‘good morning’.”</p>
      <p>And that, dear readers, is ­everything we need to know about Prince Andrew.</p>
      <p>And every explanation why today he is facing the prospect of being drummed to the wilderness fringe of the royal family.</p>
      <p>He may have ‘apparently’ spent years unable to perspire but I bet he’s sweating like a pig on a skewer now as the claims against him mount, the financial backers melt away, ­charities back off and he’s left with few friends beyond Fergie and a bunch of dodgy Kazakh ­businessmen.</p>
      <p>But what could he expect? His friendship with paedophile <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> and utter lack of empathy for victims during ­Saturday’s farcical TV interview are inexcusable.</p>
      <p>As for his ‘explanations’ for what went on between him and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-didnt-sex-accuser-20897916">Virginia Giuffre</a>?</p>
      <p>I’ve seen more substantial toilet paper.</p>
      <p>But it was all to be expected – because the root cause of all this is Prince Andrew’s boundless arrogance.</p>
      <p>In his head he’s been a James Bond Prince gallivanting around the world doing mega-deals on behalf of the Queen and cavorting with a string of beautiful women.</p>
      <p>To the rest of us he’s a gone-to-seed narcissist who’s never done a proper day’s work since the ­Falklands and spent the last few decades freeloading around the world with the deviant, disreputable or downright dangerous.</p>
      <p>Characters such as Gaddafi’s son Saif, the son-in-law of Tunisia’s ousted president, and the son-in-law of the then president of Kazakhstan, who conveniently bought his Sunninghill Park home for £15million – a mere £3million more than he’d have got on Rightmove.</p>
      <p>He’s the man who once said bankers’ bonuses were ‘minute’ and who was labelled ‘cocky’ and ‘rude’ in a leaked US ambassadorial report of an official lunch.</p>
      <p>Now former Home Secretary <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jacqui-smith">Jacqui Smith</a> has labelled him racist at another event.</p>
      <p>He’s the man who once spent £32,000 in a year flying to Scotland to play golf.</p>
      <p>His other hobbies ranging the entire spectrum from shooting geese in the home counties to shooting game in Africa.</p>
      <p>All this... because when he woke up in the morning he could tell the world to f*** off just because he wanted too.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Andrew, the world is now hurling the same ­expletive back at him.</p>
