      <h1>Mum says this photo of her sleeping child is a 'huge red flag' for naughty behaviour</h1>
      <h2>Melody Yazdani shared the photo online in the hope it will help other mums and dads</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:10:50+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:10</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Dickinson</a></address>
      <p>A mum shared this poignant picture of her son which, she said revealed a surprise cause for his naughty behaviour.</p>
      <p>Melody Yazdani shared the photo online in the hope it will help other mums and dads.</p>
      <p>The seemingly normal photograph shows little Kian asleep, but Melody said there is a "huge red flag"</p>
      <p>She wrote, back in 2018: 'All parents. If you have a child, I'm going to tell you something you need to know that you have probably never heard. And please share this.</p>
      <p>"There is a huge red flag in the picture I am sharing with this story. Do you see it?"</p>
      <p>The mum explained how last year Kian, who is now eight years old, started getting behaviour reports at school,  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/family/huge-red-flag-photo-boy-13563113?_ga=2.200888684.393526072.1541839262-537267552.1535100001">Mirror Online</a>  reports.</p>
      <p>He had not had any problems in Kindergarten and was always "intelligent, feisty and extremely active," so Melody was surprised when Kian's teacher told her he was pushing other children and "having a hard time controlling his body".</p>
      <p>With new systems in place at school, his behaviour improved - but at home it got worse, with meltdowns over little things.</p>
      <p>"Every morning it's tantrum after tantrum, before we even get out of bed," she said. "Hitting and throwing things, and the screaming. All the screaming. Starting at 5am every morning.</p>
      <p>"We were at a loss - how did he become this way, what could we have done different?"</p>
      <p>Kian started to see a therapist, who recommended he get tested for ADHD.</p>
      <p>'Lightning struck' when Melody found an article linking ADHD to sleep disordered breathing and mouth breathing.</p>
      <p>The red flag in Melody's photograph is that Kian's mouth is open while he sleeps.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BREATHE THROUGH THEIR MOUTHS. Not while awake, not while asleep. Never.</p>
      <p>"Mouth breathing is NOT NORMAL and has long term consequences for health. I'll repeat, because this is important - MOUTH BREATHING IS NOT NORMAL, NOT DURING THE DAY OR AT NIGHT.</p>
      <p>"When a child breathes through their mouth, their brain (and body) is not getting enough oxygen. At night, this lowered oxygen saturation is detrimental to the quality of sleep and their brain's ability to get enough rest."</p>
      <p>The mum went on to list other problems that mouth breathing can spark, revealing that ADHD and sleep deprivation have simliar symptoms.</p>
      <p>She claims studies with medicated ADHD kids, where their sleep disordered breathing had been fixed, showed improvement in symptoms and within six months 70% of the children were no longer medicated.</p>
      <p>"As in, their ADHD was cured. Because it wasn't ADHD. In 70% of children. Let that sink in," she wrote.</p>
      <p>Kian was diagnosed with sleep apnea and sinusitis.</p>
      <p>"He got exactly 0 minutes of REM sleep during the first study, and oxygen saturation in the low 80%, and his sinuses were 90% blocked," Melody explained.</p>
      <p>"We had no idea that Kian had a headache daily, but it was just his normal so he never thought to tell us."</p>
      <p>The mum noticed an "immediate change" when Kian's tonsils and adenoids were removed, breathing through his nose when he came out of surgery.</p>
      <p>"We have seen a complete 180 in behavior (sic)", she wrote. "No more angry tantrums, no more fixation on little OCD things, it's been an enormous change.</p>
      <p>"Here's why I am sharing: No one, in my 12 years of parenting, ever told me any of this.</p>
      <p>"All the signs were there, right in front of our eyes, and I had no clue."</p>
