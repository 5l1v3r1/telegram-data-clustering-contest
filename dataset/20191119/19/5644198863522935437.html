      <p>"We think that the truck weighed over 40 tonnes. The lorry was well over the limit and the bridge broke," the mayor of the town of Mirepoix-sur-Tarn north of Toulouse, Eric Oget, told AFP.</p>
      <p>The bridge, which was built in 1931, could take a maximum weight of 19 tonnes. It had passed recent safety inspections.</p>
      <p>France's junior environment minister Emmanuelle Wargon confirmed that "one of the theories is that truck went on the bridge with a weight exceeding the maximum".</p>
      <p>"But it is the state prosecutor who will establish the facts," she added, speaking to LCI TV.</p>
      <p>The girl was travelling in the car with her mother, who was plucked from the water by bystanders.</p>
      <p>The truck driver's body was found after a day-long search by more than 60 rescue workers, including divers.</p>
