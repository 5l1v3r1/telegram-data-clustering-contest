      <h1>Exclusive Preview: Justice League #36</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:49:47+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:49</time> by <a rel="author">Blair Marnell</a></address>
      <p>For nearly two years, the Justice/Doom war has raged for the fate of DC’s multiverse. However, the mighty Justice League has been defeated by the Legion of Doom. Starman and Martian Manhunter are dead, and the Anti-Monitor also betrayed the League. Things are looking pretty bleak for the heroes.</p>
      <p>In Superhero Hype’s exclusive preview for <b>Justice League</b> #36, Scott Snyder, and artists Francis Manapul and Howard Porter bring the war to an end. Perpetua finally has all of the power she needs to remake creation. Unfortunately for the Legion, Perpetua has no intention of elevating them to godhood. Additionally, at least one member of the Legion is facing a fate worse than death.</p>

      <p>Here’s the official description from DC.</p>
      <p><b>“How powerful is too powerful? Lex Luthor has assembled everything he needs to complete his plan of turning the world toward doom, including reviving the ancient goddess Perpetua and restoring her powers. But can he keep Perpetua from dragging the DC Universe into the abyss alongside the rest of the Multiverse? This is a question that hero and villain alike must ask, as the epic battle between the Justice League and the Legion of Doom across space and time comes crashing together. Everything that happens here sets the stage for the senses-shattering finale of the Justice/Doom War-and the fate of all existence hangs in the balance!</b>”</p>
