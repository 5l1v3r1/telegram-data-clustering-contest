      <p>The Chittoor police on Tuesday arrested a four-member gang at Nangili on the Chittoor-Karnataka border and seized cloth material worth over ₹48 lakh belonging to a Guntur-based textile mall.</p>
      <p>Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar, at a press conference, said that late on November 10, a lorry from Bengaluru carrying the cloth material belonging to a textiles trader of Guntur broke down near Gangavaram in Chittoor district. The lorry driver, acting on the instructions of his vehicle owner, contacted a mechanic named Nagendra of Ramnagar district in Karnataka for repairs.</p>
      <p>Nagendra Rao, along with three others, reached the spot from Bengaluru. The four persons then allegedly forced the lorry driver, Nagesh, to drink liquor, and after he fell unconscious, fled to Bengaluru with the cloth material by loading it into a mini-truck.</p>
      <p>After receiving a complaint from the Guntur-based textiles trader, the Chittoor police launched an investigation. With the help of mobile tower signals and CCTV camera footage at border checkposts, the police detected the movement of the accused. Apart from Nagendra Rao (35), his accomplices were identified as Suresh and Mallikarjuna of Mandya district, and Sasikumar of Bengaluru city.</p>
      <p>During the early hours of November 19 (2.15 a.m.), acting on a tip-off that the four were moving close to the Nangili inter-State border, a police party with personnel from Palamaner, Chittoor and Gangavaram circles rushed to the spot and intercepted an SUV in which the accused were travelling.</p>
      <p>After an interrogation, the accused reportedly revealed that the stolen cloth material was dumped in Bengaluru. A special party rushed there and seized the stocks. A case was registered and the four accused were sent on remand. The SUV and lorry used in the clandestine operation were also seized.</p>
