      <p>"Drought is truly a national issue and it's critical that everyone, from all jurisdictions, band together to provide a co-ordinated approach to this pressing issue," Mr Marshall said.</p>
      <p>"Farmers doing it tough on the ground really don't care about jurisdictional borders - they just want to see firm action to help see them through this terrible drought.</p>
      <p>"Meeting in a forum like this will be an important step in getting on the same page and scoping innovative ideas like establishing a 'one-stop-shop' for drought assistance, removing duplication of programs and the need for farmers to continually deal with two sets of rules and bureaucracies.</p>

      <p>"In my view, it simply doesn't make sense that a farmer wishing to access assistance would have to speak to numerous government agencies. They should be able to make one call and know up-front what's on the table for them in terms of support."</p>
      <p>Mr Marshall said the meeting in Moree would also provide the agriculture ministers an opportunity to meet with local businesses, farmers and Moree Plains Shire Council and hear first-hand how drought is impacting people on the ground.</p>
      <p>"Seeing is believing, so I think it's important that other ministers - including the federal Drought Minister - see just how tough things are here for farmers, businesses and communities in our region," Mr Marshall said.</p>
      <p>"I'm really pleased that ministers agreed to travel to our part of the world for these critical discussions and to learn about the savage human toll this deep and lengthy dry is having on everyone who lives here.</p>
      <p>"I'm incredibly proud of the state government's $1.8 billion drought assistance package but as always I think there's more than can be done. I look forward to discussing additional ways we can support our hard-working farmers and communities next month."</p>
      <p>The AgMin meeting will take place in Moree on 10 December.</p>
