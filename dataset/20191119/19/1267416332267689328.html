      <h1>Facebook quietly releases meme-making app in Canada</h1>
      <h2>Don't let your memes be dreams</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:05:04+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/bradly-shankar" target="_blank">Bradly Shankar</a></address>
      <p>Facebook has launched a meme-making app called Whale in Canada aimed at younger users.</p>
      <p>Whale lets users edit photos using crop and text tools, emoji, filters, effects and more. These can then be shared as memes on Facebook and sister apps Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>

      <p>Currently, the app is only available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/whale-meme-creator/id1482865335">App Store in Canada</a>.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Facebook chose to quietly launch the app under the developer name of ‘NPE Team,’ which refers to its New Product Experimentation division.</p>
      <p>NPE’s previous apps, the Bump school-based social networking app and Aux music streaming app, were also youth-oriented and debuted exclusively on the Canadian App Store.</p>
      <p><i>MobileSyrup </i>has reached out to Facebook for confirmation on whether Whale will come to Android. This article will be updated once a response has been received.</p>
