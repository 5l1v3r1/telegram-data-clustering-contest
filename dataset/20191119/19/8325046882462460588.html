      <p>Chinese officials confirmed yet another case of bubonic plague originating from a hunter in Inner Mongolia. The announcement marks the third confirmed case in the country in less than two weeks.</p>
      <p>The most recent case is that of a 55-year-old man who reportedly contracted the disease after eating a wild rabbit he had killed in Inner Mongolia’s Huade County on November 5, <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/17/c_138562299.htm">according to an investigation conducted by state media agency Xinhua</a>. Almost immediately, 28 people in close proximity to the infected man were placed under medical quarantine. Those 28 people did not show any plague symptoms, according to the investigation.</p>

      <p>WHO</p>
      <p>Plague is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/plague/symptoms-causes/syc-20351291">an infection caused by the Yersinia pestis bacteria and transmitted</a> by fleas. Plague comes in three variants – bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic – depending on its location in the body. Bubonic plague, the variant responsible for <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Black-Death">nearly 25 million deaths in the 14th century</a>, causes buboes – extremely swollen lymph nodes that bulge under the arms, neck, and groin. Septicemic plague affects the blood and can turn a victim’s skin black, while pneumonic (the most deadly form) attacks the lungs and can lead people to violently cough up blood.</p>
      <p>This weekend’s plague diagnosis marks the third reported case in China this month. Last week, a married couple from Inner Mongolia was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/health/china-plague-intl-hnk-scn-scli/index.html">rushed to a municipal hospital in Beijing</a> seeking emergency care. In that case, both patients had contracted pneumonic plague.</p>
      <p>A Chinese investigation, according to Xinhua, did not find any connection between the Beijing pneumonic plague cases and the more recent bubonic plague case.</p>
      <h3>Concerns fester over official Chinese reporting</h3>
      <p>While Chinese officials have <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/11/15/779526827/china-reports-2-cases-of-the-most-dangerous-type-of-plague?utm_campaign=npr&amp;amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=social">issued assurances</a> saying the potential for a plague outbreak are “extremely low,” some <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/three-cases-plague-diagnosed-china-180973578/">fear the state may not be releasing all the information they have</a> about the incidents. In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191113015611/https://www.cn-healthcare.com/article/20191113/content-526068.html">blog post</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/11/15/779526827/china-reports-2-cases-of-the-most-dangerous-type-of-plague?utm_campaign=npr&amp;amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=social">first reported on by NPR</a>, Li Jifeng, a doctor at the hospital where the first two patients were treated, said the Chinese government sat on the information for nine days before finally releasing a statement acknowledging the infected patients. Li’s post, which was first released on the messaging app WeChat, was reportedly removed by Chinese censors not long after it was put up.</p>
