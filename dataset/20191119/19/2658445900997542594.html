      <p>Coach of Tottenham Hotspurs, Mauricio Pochettino has been sacked  after five years in charge of the club.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was relieved of his duties following the dismissal performance of the club recently. They have just won only five matches in all competition this season.</p>
      <p>Chairman of the club, Daniel Levy said on Tuesday that a change had to be made in the “club’s best interests”.</p>
      <p>“We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the board has taken lightly, nor in haste,” Levy said.</p>
      <p>“Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>
      <p>“It falls to the board to make the difficult decisions – this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff – but we do so in the club’s best interests.</p>

      <p>“Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history. I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us.</p>
      <p>“I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here.</p>
      <p>“We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters.”</p>
      <p>Tottenham had enjoyed a hugely successful European campaign last season, reaching the UEFA Champions League final.</p>
