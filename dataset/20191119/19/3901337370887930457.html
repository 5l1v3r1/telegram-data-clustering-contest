      <p>Bernard Parker has given his thoughts on how the FIFA break affected Kaizer Chiefs ahead of their Telkom Knockout semifinal, explaining why he felt it’s been crucial for them…</p>

      </p>
      <p>Parker, who remains an integral part of the Amakhosi setup under Ernst Middendorp despite his age, is expected to feature this coming weekend as they go into battle with an in-form Maritzburg United that are also targeting a spot in the TKO final.</p>
      <p>Having faced tough games against the likes of Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates, ‘Die Hond’ says that the international break was welcomed by everyone at Naturena as they were then able to fully recuperate, also adding that it allowed them the chance to ‘refresh’.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Chiefs’ official website ahead of this weekend’s game, Parker said, “The FIFA international break came at the right time for us after we had an intensive three weeks, from the Sundowns game to playing Pirates twice and Chippa… It was good for us to win those games and get the maximum points in the league and also progress in the cup competition. The break was good for us to refresh and refocus.”</p>
      <p>The break also gave Chiefs time to get some of their injured players back ready and in contention, and given the triple suspension of Willard Katsande, Daniel Akpeyi and Erick Mathoho, their squad depth will be tested.</p>

      <p>Parker, 33, is likely to don the captain’s armband for the Glamour Boys should Itumeleng Khune not return, but it won’t be an easy task against a Maritzburg side who are high on confidence and on an unbeaten run of their own.</p>
