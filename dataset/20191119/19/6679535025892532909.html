      <h1>Woman peddler held after year-long pursuit</h1>
      <h2>Accused was wanted in connection with seizure of 167 kg cannabis last year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:34:13+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Gautam-S-Mengle-641/" target="_blank">Gautam S. Mengle</a></address>
      <p>The Anti Narcotics Cell (ANC) of the Mumbai Police Crime Branch on Tuesday morning arrested a 37-year-old woman who is allegedly among the top peddlers of cannabis in the city. The police were in pursuit of the woman, whose mother and sister have also been arrested for drug peddling, for the past one year in connection with the seizure of 167 kg of cannabis last year.</p>
      <p>ANC officers said the accused, identified as Shamim Majid Sheikh, was picked up from Damodar Park in Ghatkopar. The ANC’s Ghatkopar unit had been tracking the accused for a year and she proved elusive as she often changed her location.</p>
      <p>Shivdeep Lande, Deputy Commissioner of Police (ANC), said, “On November 18 last year, on Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road, our team had intercepted a consignment of 167 kg of cannabis, which had been brought into the city in a taxi from Visakhapatnam. Ms. Sheikh’s sister, Parveen, was in the taxi and was arrested. Ms. Sheikh, who was supposed to receive the consignment, saw our team from afar and fled the scene. Efforts were on to trace her since then.”</p>
      <p>With the help of local informants, the ANC found out that Ms. Sheikh was operating out of a rented flat in Chembur. However, when Ms. Sheikh’s mother was arrested by the Powai police in July this year in a drug peddling case, she fled the city. An officer, who was part of the operation, said, “The ANC learnt that she had fled to Uttar Pradesh to lie low for a few months. Earlier this month, we received a tip-off that she was back in Mumbai and had rented a flat in Maitri Cooperative Housing Society in Damodar Park. However, despite several visits to the area, Ms. Sheikh could not be found. We then cultivated informants among some of the local residents and shopkeepers.”</p>
      <p>On Monday night, a local informant told the ANC that the accused was spotted going home and a team was rushed to the spot. The team staked out the building that night and followed Ms. Sheikh when she left her home. The ANC officers finally intercepted her near Sakinaka Metro station and arrested her. Ms. Sheikh has been charged under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.</p>
      <h3>‘Built a reputation’</h3>
      <p>Mr. Lande said, “Ms. Sheikh has been in the business for several years and had made a name for herself as someone who would always deliver once she received an order. She would procure cannabis in large quantities from a supplier based in Visakhapatnam and peddle smaller quantities of it in Mumbai. Her husband also has a criminal record. He was recently released from prison after serving a sentence in a murder case.”</p>
