      <p><b>What’s happened?</b> We are aware of issues streaming 3AW via iHeartRadio this morning.</p>
      <p>This may also impact those listening via products such as Google Home.</p>
      <p><b>What can I do?</b> The 3AW app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/radio-3aw/id443063438">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thisisaim.radio3aw&amp;hl=en_AU">android</a>) and 3AW website are unaffected, so try using those.</p>
      <p><b>When will it be fixed?</b> iHeartRadio has now made changes to rectify the issue. Some users may need to refresh the stream (shutdown the app or briefly switch stations).</p>
