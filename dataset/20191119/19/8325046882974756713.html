          <b><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/marie-kondo">Marie Kondo</a>, author of the best-selling book “The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up” and star of a spin-off Netflix series, has inspired many people to declutter their homes.</b>

        <li>She’s since opened a new online store to sell a variety of home goods, including pricey storage containers and fancy kitchenware.</li>

          <b>Some of her offerings, including gemstone-infused water bottles and tuning forks, have dubious wellness claims.</b>

          <b>While some of the products may have mild positive benefits due to the placebo effect, they’ll likely impact your wallet more than your health.</b>

      <p>Organizing expert Marie Kondo sparked joy last year with her hit Netflix series on tidying up that <a href="https://www.insider.com/marie-kondo-tidying-up-does-it-work-mental-health-2019-1">inspired many people</a> to clear their junk drawers and adopt a more minimalist aesthetic.</p>
      <p>She now has a solution for people looking to fill those newly-emptied shelves: <a href="https://www.insider.com/marie-kondo-sparks-confusion-launching-new-online-homeware-store-2019-11">an online store offering a range of home goods</a>, including some products with questionable health claims like crystal “cleansers” and infusers.</p>
      <p>The site suggests a <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/collections/cooking-kitchen/products/konmari-kitchen-decor-gem-water-balance-gem-water">$98 gemstone water bottle</a>, for instance, purifies water and infuses it with “the power of gemstones” to “bring mind, body, and spirit into harmony.” A $75 rose quartz and tuning fork combo, meanwhile, is said to boost the “healing powers” of crystals through a special frequency.</p>
      <p>Any “healing powers” of crystals are mainly anecdotal, however, and evidence suggests any benefits are due to the placebo effect. Plus, there’s no evidence supporting crystals’ supposed power to cleanse, heal, or cure anything, so it’s important to manage expectations – and your budget.</p>

      <h3>There’s no science behind any of crystal’s supposed health benefits besides the placebo effect</h3>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/goop">GOOP-guru Gwyneth Paltrow</a> to <a href="https://www.insider.com/healing-crystals-wall-street-millionaires-2017-12">Wall Street financiers</a>, crystals and their supposed healing or energizing properties have remained one of the most popular health trends in recent years.</p>
      <p>Despite the common claims that gems and crystals can <a href="https://www.insider.com/ways-to-boost-your-energy-after-sleepless-night-2018-5">boost good energy</a>, and cleanse bad vibes, they lack a strong scientific backing. And, although different types and colors of gems allegedly promote different benefits, there’s nothing in the chemical composition of crystals that even suggests this is possible.</p>
      <p>What research has shown, however, is that the placebo effect is hard at work in the anecdotal benefits of crystal healing. A 2001 study found that participants were just as likely to feel effects like warmth, tingling, and overall well-being from holding a fake crystal comparing with holding a piece of real quartz.</p>
      <p>“There is no evidence that crystal healing works over and above a placebo effect,” lead author and psychologist Dr. Christopher French told <a href="https://www.livescience.com/40347-crystal-healing.html">LiveScience</a>.</p>
      <p>That’s not to say the placebo effect is a bad thing: Believing something works can you a sense of control over your situation, however illusionary, according to psychologist Stuart Vyse. “People feel better having done something,” Vyse told <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzdav3/do-crystals-work-placebo-effect">Vice</a>.</p>
      <p>There’s also no evidence that using crystals will do you any harm, as long as you’re not using them in place of traditional medical advice when needed.</p>
      <p>So, if a $98 water bottle brings you meaning and happiness, as Kondo emphasizes, her new store has you covered. Just don’t expect it to heal anything.</p>
