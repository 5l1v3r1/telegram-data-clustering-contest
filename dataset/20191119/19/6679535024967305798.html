      <p>It is close to four months since the Centre revoked the special status for Jammu and Kashmir (J&amp;K) and the government has inexplicably kept the National Conference leader Dr. Farooq Abdullah still under preventive detention. The former Chief Minister of J&amp;K has played an important role in the politics of the erstwhile State. The Speaker should intervene and facilitate the participation of Dr. Abdullah in the winter session. Such detentions exhibit the dictatorial character of the Narendra Modi government. In a democracy, there should be no misuse of legislation like that of the Public Safety Act (Front page, “Uproar in LS over Farooq’s detention,” Nov. 19)</p>

      <p>Dr. Abdullah is a sitting Member of Parliament. He has every right to take part in the winter session. To keep him under detention is illegal. By silencing his voice, the Modi government is only justifying our suspicion that all is not well in Kashmir.</p>
