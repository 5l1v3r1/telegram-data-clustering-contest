      <p>Kim Sook stated that she:<i> "used to start businesses here and there without any thought. I started a clothing store once. But waking up that early to go to the market and the act of getting clothing from far places was tough. There was no time to sleep. I kept trying, but gave up after a month and a half." </i></p>
      <p>She then gave advice to a civilian guest on the show, stating:<i> "I saw the process to be too easy. But afterward, I never tried doing business like that." </i></p>
