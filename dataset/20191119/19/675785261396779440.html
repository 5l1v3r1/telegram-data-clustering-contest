      <p>Lionel Messi made his feelings to known to Edinson Cavani after being offered to fight and confidently replied to his South American rival: "Whenever you want".</p>
      <p>Argentina and Uruguay played a friendly match in Israel on Monday night, but tensions between the two forwards boiled over when they almost came to blows.</p>
      <p>Uruguay international Cavani offered to fight superstar Messi during his country's friendly against the Argentines in Israel on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Messi is reported to have replied "whenever you want" to the challenge as a scuffle broke out after the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> legend was on the receiving end of a tough tackle.</p>

      <p>Luiz Suarez, Messi's Barca teammate, split up the duo as they continued to bicker in the tunnel.</p>
      <p>Diego Godin also tried to act as a peacemaker as he put his arm around Messi to try and bring a sense of calm to the situation.</p>
      <p>Despite it being an ugly moment in a 2-2 draw - which saw Messi, Cavani, Suarez and Sergio Aguero all get on the scoreboard - the Paris Saint-Germain ace insisted it was part of a fractious match.</p>
      <p>Cavani told <a href="https://www.tycsports.com/futbol-de-argentina/fuerte-cruce-entre-messi-y-cavani-en-el-primer-tiempo-20191118.html">TyC Sports</a> : "It's part of football, Clasicos are like this.</p>

      <p>"The truth is that it was at times a game that had friction, there were challenges and things that are part of football, especially of South American [football].</p>
      <p>"We take positives from our performance and the fact that we were able to score two goals. We still need to improve but it's good to end the year like this."</p>
      <p>On the pitch, Messi converted an added-time penalty as Argentina salvaged a 2-2 draw against their South American rivals Uruguay in a friendly in Tel Aviv.</p>

      <p>Three days after marking his return from a three-month international ban by scoring the winner against Brazil, Messi once again underscored his value to his country.</p>
      <p>He floated a precise 63rd-minute free-kick from which Sergio Aguero headed home to cancel out Edison Cavani's 34th-minute opener for the home side.</p>
      <p>And after Luis Suarez put Uruguay back in front from a set-piece, Messi's persistence paid off after Martin Caceres had been harshly penalised for handball in the box.</p>
