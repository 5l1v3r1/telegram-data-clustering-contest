      <h1>Random: Trophy Hunter Creates Mural Dedicated to His Past 200 Platinums</h1>
      <h2>That's a lot of gongs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.pushsquare.com/users/LiamCroft" target="_blank">Liam Croft</a></address>
      <p>Do you remember your very first Platinum Trophy? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/dyiold/image_to_celebrate_the_past_decade_of_playstation/">Reddit user eblackham</a> does -- it was <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/ratchet_and_clank_a_crack_in_time">Ratchet &amp; Clank: A Crack in Time</a> on PS3. That's because the man in question is very much a dedicated Trophy hunter with more than 200 Platinums to his name. To celebrate the landmark moment, and look back on the past decade of PlayStation, he has created a canvas paying homage to every single Platinum Trophy unlocked on his account.</p>
      <p>Taking a peek at it above, we recognise Platinum trinkets for the likes of <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/battlefield_4">Battlefield 4</a>, <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/god_of_war_iii">God of War III</a>, <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/doom">DOOM</a>, and <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/battlefield_hardline">Battlefield Hardline</a>. When asked which were his favourites to unlock, eblackham lists last year's <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/god_of_war">God of War</a> and <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/uncharted_4_a_thiefs_end">Uncharted 4: A Thief's End</a>, while <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/spec_ops_the_line">Spec Ops: The Line</a> and <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/dead_space_2">Dead Space 2</a> were particularly tough when it came to reaching 100% completion.</p>
      <p>However, he hasn't stopped there. <a href="https://psnprofiles.com/psycho_clank314">The PSN user</a> is now up to 215 Platinum trophies with an overall level of 52. Impressive stuff! Can you come anywhere near to beating that score? Share your own Trophy level in the comments below.</p>
