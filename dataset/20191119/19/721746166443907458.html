      <h1>League of Legends patch 9.23 change list</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:08:15+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.polygon.com/users/Julia%20Lee" target="_blank">Julia Lee</a></address>
      <p>Preseason has officially begun for <i>League of Legends</i>, which means this patch brings about sweeping changes that will shake up the game’s meta.</p>
      <p>One of the big changes in this patch is the inclusion of additional effects from the Elemental Drakes. Depending on what dragon is on Summoner’s Rift, the map’s terrain will change with it. For example, the Ocean Drake will spawn more fruit and brushes around the map and the Cloud Drake will increase jungle movement speed.</p>
      <p>More brushes to hide in have also been placed around the map and both bot and top lane have new alcoves for players to duke it out in.</p>
      <p>Pulsefire Thresh will also get dropped this patch, and <a href="https://www.riftherald.com/lol-skins/2019/10/24/20930433/victorious-aatrox-skin-ranked-reward">Victorious Aatrox</a> should start getting added to accounts that reached Gold or higher in any ranked <i>League of Legends</i> (not Teamfight Tactics) queue soon.</p>

      <h3>End of Season</h3>
      <p>The 2019 season has drawn to a close, and we hope you reached your ranked goals this season. If you achieved Gold or higher in Summoner’s Rift Ranked Solo or Flex, or Twisted Treeline Ranked, you’ve earned Victorious Aatrox. If you achieved Gold or higher in two of those queues, you’ve also earned a Victorious Aatrox chroma.</p>
      <h3>Elemental Rifts</h3>
      <p>This preseason, we’re adding more game-to-game variety and opportunities for mastery to Summoner’s Rift. After the second Elemental Drake of the game dies, the map will permanently transform to one of four Elemental Rifts, each with unique terrain changes that’ll alter the way you take on teamfights, rotations, vision, and objective control.</p>
      <p>Elemental Rifts don’t favor a specific team, so games are still in players’ hands regardless of which one takes shape. We also wanted to ensure the Rifts feel intuitive even in your first game, so they don’t introduce any new mechanics and terrain changes always occur in the same areas no matter which element spawns.</p>
      <h4>Transformation mechanics</h4>
      <p>TRANSFORMATION TRIGGER :: After the second Elemental Drake dies and the third is announced</p>
      <p>RIFT ELEMENT :: Same as the element of the third drake</p>
      <p>TERRITORIAL :: Once the map transforms, all future Elemental Drake spawns will be of that element only</p>
      <p>TERRAIN CHANGES :: Always occur in the four jungle quadrants, centered around the buff camps, as well as in dragon pit</p>
      <h4>Infernal Rift</h4>
      <p>New paths make opportunities for a quick flank or sidestep that your opponent isn’t expecting.</p>
      <p>JUNGLE :: The brush nearest to Blue and Red buffs burn away, and new pathways open up through the Blue and Red buff pits</p>
      <p>DRAGON PIT :: The entrance to Dragon pit widens</p>
      <h4>Mountain Rift</h4>
      <p>Extra tight spaces give opportunities for big AOE wombos and create some interesting new hiding spots with fog of war.</p>
      <p>JUNGLE :: Two new bluffs of rock emerge in each jungle quadrant</p>
      <p>DRAGON PIT :: A rock formation rises in front of the Dragon pit</p>
      <h4>Ocean Rift</h4>
      <p>Sneak around the jungle or look for a new ambush opportunity.</p>
      <p>JUNGLE :: Most of the brush in the jungle grows larger and new Honeyfruit spawns near the buff camps. Water pools into puddles throughout the jungle, which is mostly aesthetic unless you’re the Empress of the Elements or running the Waterwalking rune.</p>
      <p>DRAGON PIT :: New brush patches sprout up around the Dragon pit</p>
      <h4>Cloud Rift</h4>
      <p>Dodge skillshots or make a swift collapse on your enemies trying to sneak a far away objective.</p>
      <p>JUNGLE :: Air currents flow throughout the area around Blue and Red buffs, granting speed boosts to everyone inside</p>
      <p>DRAGON PIT :: Dragon Pit also becomes a speed boosting wind tunnel</p>
      <h3>Side Lane Alcoves</h3>
      <p>We’re adding two new lane alcoves to the Rift, one in each side lane. We don’t expect laning to fundamentally change as a result, but the extra terrain and its impact on line of sight should occasionally offer new playmaking opportunities through positioning, jukes, flanks, and ganks.</p>
      <p>BREATHTAKING VISTA OF DEATH :: New alcoves have been carved into the outer corners of top and bot lanes</p>
      <p>BOT LANE BRUSH :: Two long patches &gt;&gt;&gt; Three patches, mirroring top lane</p>
      <h3>River Entrance Brush</h3>
      <p>New brush patches near the blue buff ramps into river add new strategic and tactical options as teams approach and contest objectives.</p>
      <p>WHERE’S GAREN? :: New brush has been added by the river entrances in both Blue buff quadrants</p>
      <h3>Elemental Drakes</h3>
      <h4>Dragon Souls</h4>
      <p>Dragon Souls are a new end-game payoff for the team who wins the Elemental Drake game, a powerful reward that’s similar to an Epic objective. Dragon Souls don’t offer the same moment-to-moment strength as Baron or Elder buff, but they’re permanent and an additional bonus on top of the drake stacks their bearers already earned.</p>
      <p>I GOT SOUL :: The first team to slay four Elemental Drakes gains a <b>Dragon Soul</b> matching the Elemental Rift</p>
      <p>EXCLUSIVITY :: Elder Dragon begins spawning after one team gains a Dragon Soul, meaning only one team can have it.</p>
      <p>DURATION :: Like Elemental Drake buffs, Dragon Souls are permanent and persist through death</p>
      <h4>Infernal Soul</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Every 3 seconds, your next damaging attack or ability on an enemy unit triggers a small explosion, dealing 90 (+0.25 bonus attack damage) (+0.15 ability power) (+0.03 bonus health) damage to the target and nearby enemies.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Mountain Soul</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>After not taking damage for 5 seconds, gain a shield for 225 (+0.2 bonus attack damage) (+0.15 ability power) (+0.15 bonus health)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Ocean Soul</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Dealing damage to enemies heals you for 180 (+0.4 bonus attack damage) (+0.25 ability power) (+0.1 bonus health) and restores 90 (+0.04 maximum mana) mana over 3 seconds.</li>
        <li>Damage to minions or monsters regenerates with 30% effectiveness.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cloud Soul</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Passively gain 10% increased movement speed.</li>
        <li>After casting your ultimate, gain an additional 30% movement speed for 3 seconds <i>(30 second cooldown)</i>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Elemental Drake Buffs</h3>
      <p>We’re updating the buffs to be more equal in power and excitement. Stack for stack, elemental buffs are weaker than before to avoid excessively power creeping SR’s buff ecosystem. With Dragon Souls adding new late game payout to Elemental Drakes, we’re switching from the current frontloaded buff stacks back to a linear model. Last note: You can now get four stacks of an element if the enemy team gets the first two or three drakes (always different elements), then you get the next four (always the same element).</p>
      <h4>Infernal</h4>
      <p>Just a balance pass.</p>
      <p>INFERNAL MIGHT :: +10/17/24% attack damage and ability power &gt;&gt;&gt; +5/10/15/20% attack damage and ability power</p>
      <h4>Mountain</h4>
      <p>Extra damage to objectives was a subtle-yet-powerful snowballing effect that was often hard to appreciate outside of coordinated play. We’re switching Mountain to a more straightforward effect all players can play around.</p>
      <p>MOUNTAINOUS VIGOR :: +16/23/30% bonus true damage to epic monsters and turrets &gt;&gt;&gt; +8/16/24/32% armor and magic resist</p>
      <h4>Ocean</h4>
      <p>We’re removing Ocean’s mana regen to even its power out among users regardless of resource type. That gives us room to allow Ocean’s healing to continue in combat, which is a buff for any user.</p>
      <p>OCEANIC WILL :: 6/9/12% missing health and mana regen per 5 seconds when you haven’t taken champion/turret damage within 8 seconds &gt;&gt;&gt; 5/10/15/20% missing health regen per 5 seconds <i>(mana regen removed)</i></p>
      <h4>Cloud</h4>
      <p>Cloud’s movement speed was powerful, but not all that exciting. We’re moving the speed boost to Cloud’s Elemental Rift (where we can support it with visuals) and adding a different kind of haste to Cloud’s buff.</p>
      <p>CLOUDBRINGER’S GRACE :: +3/4.5/6% bonus movement speed (tripled while out of combat) &gt;&gt;&gt; 10/20/30/40% ultimate CDR, ignoring the CDR cap</p>
      <h3>Elemental Drake Mechanics</h3>
      <p>With drake types going down to just one element after the Rift transforms, we’re ensuring the first few you see don’t double up on elements so you still experience a variety of drakes in each game.</p>
      <p>DRAKE SPAWN ORDER :: Random &gt;&gt;&gt; The first three drakes are now always three unique elements. All subsequent drakes will be the same element as the third drake.</p>
      <p>DRAKE SPAWN WINDOW :: 5:00 initial, 5:00 respawn until 35:00 &gt;&gt;&gt; 5:00 initial, 5:00 respawn until one team has slain four drakes <i>(see Dragon Soul section above)</i></p>
      <p>Since the Elemental Drake buffs are a bit weaker, we’re dropping the health of the first two drakes. The battle over the Dragon Soul begins heating up after that, so drakes after the first two have more health to widen the opportunity for teams to contest.</p>
      <p>HEALTH :: 3500 (+240 per level, minimum level 6) &gt;&gt;&gt; 2650 (+240 per level, minimum level 6) before the Rift transforms; 4350 (+240 per level, minimum level 6) for the third drake onward</p>
      <h3>Elder Dragon</h3>
      <p>Up until now, Elder Dragon massively favored the team that was already ahead due to scaling with drake stacks (and in super long games, itself). We’re removing that scaling to make room for power that’s equally rewarding whether you’re pressing a lead or making a comeback.</p>
      <p>[REM] ELEMENTAL MULTIPLIER :: Elder Dragon’s buff no longer increases the effects of Elemental Drake buffs by 50%</p>
      <p>BURN DAMAGE :: 45 (+45 per Elemental Drake stack) true damage over 3 seconds &gt;&gt;&gt; 90-270 true damage over 3 seconds (at 25:00-45:00 game time)</p>
      <p>[REM] BURNING BRIGHT :: Elder Dragon’s burn no longer reveals enemies</p>
      <p>[REM] ELDER MULTIPLIER :: Taking Elder Dragon a second time no longer increases the Elemental buff multiplier to 100% or the burn damage to 135 (+90 per Elemental Drake stack)</p>
      <p>Elder’s new mechanic is an execute, sharpening its identity as the end-game teamfighting buff and making its impact much more obvious than the DoT and drake scaling it used to grant. Note that the 20% threshold looks higher than it is in practice: You’ll rarely bring an enemy to exactly 19.9% before they go boom.</p>
      <p>[NEW] EXECUTE :: Damaging an enemy at less than 20% health causes them to die in an <b>Elder Immolation</b> after 0.5 seconds (no cooldown).</p>
      <p>DENIED :: <b>Elder Immolation</b> can’t execute enemies through invulnerability effects like Zhonya’s Hourglass or undying effects like Kindred’s <b>R - Lamb’s Respite</b></p>
      <p>We’re standardizing the duration of Elder and Baron to three minutes. These buffs should last long enough for attacking teams to gain real advantages off coordinated power plays, but not so long that attackers come out ahead if they passively leave opponents stuck on defense for extended periods. If these duration changes make Elder too strong or Baron too weak, we’ll adjust their effects accordingly.</p>
      <p>BUFF DURATION :: 150 seconds; lost on death &gt;&gt;&gt; 180 seconds; still lost on death</p>
      <p>Final note about how often Elder will actually show up in games. In a complete stomp, the earliest Elder can spawn is 26:00 plus time spent in combat with the drakes. But in a game that’s going even or isn’t seeing many objectives taken, it’s also possible for Elder to <i>never</i> spawn.</p>
      <p>SPAWN RULES :: First dragon spawn after 35:00; 6:00 respawn &gt;&gt;&gt; 6:00 after one team kills their fourth Elemental Drake; 6:00 respawn</p>
      <h3>Baron Buff</h3>
      <p>We’re standardizing the duration of Elder and Baron to three minutes. Though they have different strategic strengths, both buffs should last long enough for attacking teams to gain real advantages off coordinated power plays but not so long that defenders are paralyzed for excessive lengths of time. If these duration changes make Elder too strong or Baron too weak, we’ll adjust their effects accordingly.</p>
      <p>DURATION :: 210 seconds &gt;&gt;&gt; 180 seconds</p>
      <h3>Buff Visuals</h3>
      <p>Visuals for Blue Buff, Red Buff, Red Buff’s burn effect, Hand of Baron, and Aspect of the Dragon (Elder Dragon buff) have all been updated. All monster buffs are now visually cohesive, including the new Dragon Souls.</p>
      <h3>Top Lane Influence</h3>
      <h4>Rift Herald</h4>
      <p>With the increased importance on drakes on bot side, we’re spawning Rift Herald a bit earlier and letting her respawn once so teams don’t completely abandon their top laners in favor of bot lane presence. (Y’know...more than they already do.)</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rift Herald Fight</b>
      </p>
      <p>INITIAL SPAWN :: 10:00 &gt;&gt;&gt; 8:00</p>
      <p>[NEW] RESPAWN :: 6:00</p>
      <p>DESPAWN :: 19:30, delayed to 19:50 if in combat <i>(unchanged)</i></p>
      <p>HEALTH :: 10,000-16,000 (levels 6-12) &gt;&gt;&gt; 8,250-16,500 (levels 6-12)</p>
      <p>ATTACK SPEED :: 0.5 &gt;&gt;&gt; 0.4 <i>(it’s easier to poke Rift Herald’s eye before she spins around)</i></p>
      <p>
        <b>Summoned Rift Herald</b>
      </p>
      <p>EYE OF THE HERALD PICK-UP WINDOW :: 40 seconds &gt;&gt;&gt; 20 seconds</p>
      <p>EYE OF THE HERALD CHANNEL :: 4 seconds &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 second</p>
      <p>HERALD LEVEL :: Average level of all ten champions, determined on ||| using Eye of the Herald &gt;&gt;&gt; picking up Eye of the Herald</p>
      <p>HEALTH :: 4000-6400 (levels 6-12) &gt;&gt;&gt; 3180-6360 (levels 6-12)</p>
      <p>HEADBUTT TURRET DAMAGE :: 40% current heath (1600-2560), minimum 1500 &gt;&gt;&gt; 1500-2550 (levels 6-12)</p>
      <p>HEADBUTT SELF-DAMAGE :: 25% current health &gt;&gt;&gt; 66% current health</p>
      <h3>Minion XP</h3>
      <p>We’re very lightly adjusting minion XP to slightly equalize the influence top and bot laners have on the game. Solo laners will level about 2% faster from minions, while duo laners (or solo laners getting non-stop jungler attention) will level about 2% slower. Put another way, every five waves adds up to an extra caster minion for solo laners and one fewer for bot.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Solo XP</b>
      </p>
      <p>MELEE :: 58.8 &gt;&gt;&gt; 60.45</p>
      <p>CASTER :: 29.44 &gt;&gt;&gt; 29.76</p>
      <p>CANNON :: 92 &gt;&gt;&gt; 93</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shared XP</b>
      </p>
      <p>Divide evenly among the champions sharing XP.</p>
      <p>MELEE :: 76.8 &gt;&gt;&gt; 75.4</p>
      <p>CASTER :: 38.4 &gt;&gt;&gt; 37.12</p>
      <p>CANNON :: 120 &gt;&gt;&gt; 116</p>
      <h3>Turret Plating</h3>
      <p>Slightly buffing Turret Plating durability to prevent group-and-push blowouts in the early game, especially with the Rift Herald changes in mind.</p>
      <p>BULWARK RESISTANCES :: 25 &gt;&gt;&gt; 35 armor and magic resist per third, fourth, and fifth attacker when a plate is destroyed</p>
      <h3>Doran’s Shield</h3>
      <p>Melee regen increased, ranged regen decreased.</p>
      <p>PASSIVE :: Up to 30 health over 10 seconds when damaged by an enemy champion &gt;&gt;&gt; Up to 40 health over 8 seconds when damaged by an enemy champion, based on missing health. 66% effective for ranged users or when triggered by AoE, DoT, or proc effects</p>
      <h3>Jungle Pacing</h3>
      <p>We’re incentivizing junglers to prioritize farming rather than just fitting camps in between ganks. Higher camp uptime ensures junglers have consistent access to gold and XP on their side of the map, and the removal of catchup XP steepens the cost of failed ganks. Since junglers will be able to clear their camps more frequently, we’re reducing the gold and experience a full clear grants so they don’t take over games. We’re also ensuring both sides of the jungle get junglers to level 3 in their first clear.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jungle Item XP</b>
      </p>
      <p>[REM] CATCH-UP XP :: Jungle items no longer grant additional XP on monster kill if you’re behind in levels (epic monsters still innately have catch-up XP though)</p>
      <p>FIRST CAMP BONUS XP :: 120 &gt;&gt;&gt; 165</p>
      <p>
        <b>Camp Timers</b>
      </p>
      <p>SMALL CAMP RESPAWN :: 150 seconds &gt;&gt;&gt; 120 seconds</p>
      <p>[NEW] SMALL CAMP RESPAWN ICONS :: If your team had vision of a small camp when it was killed, you’ll see a respawn icon on the minimap 15 seconds before respawn</p>
      <p>BUFF CAMP RESPAWN ICONS :: Buff camp respawn icons change from gray to yellow ||| 20 seconds &gt;&gt;&gt; 15 seconds before respawn</p>
      <p>
        <b>Krugs</b>
      </p>
      <p>BASE XP :: 247 (217 on first clear) &gt;&gt;&gt; 160 <i>(Ancient Krug’s first clear penalty removed)</i></p>
      <p>BASE GOLD :: 125 &gt;&gt;&gt; 120</p>
      <p>
        <b>Murkwolves</b>
      </p>
      <p>BASE XP :: 115 &gt;&gt;&gt; 95</p>
      <p>BASE GOLD :: 84 &gt;&gt;&gt; 70</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gromp</b>
      </p>
      <p>BASE HEALTH :: 1800 &gt;&gt;&gt; 2100</p>
      <p>BASE XP :: 115 &gt;&gt;&gt; 135</p>
      <p>BASE GOLD :: 86 &gt;&gt;&gt; 105</p>
      <p>
        <b>Raptors</b>
      </p>
      <p>BASE XP :: 115 &gt;&gt;&gt; 95</p>
      <p>BASE GOLD :: 112 &gt;&gt;&gt; 85</p>
      <h3>Lethality Items</h3>
      <p>Though the item system currently has three Lethality options, AD assassins overwhelmingly favor Duskblade and Youmuu’s and typically skip Edge of Night. This leads to a lot of same-ness in terms of how one game feels relative to the next for them. We’re adding two new options and reworking Edge to give assassin players more ways to adapt their build to each game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Duskblade of Draktharr</b>
      </p>

      <p>We’re refreshing support items to be less poachable by solo laners and have an expanded quest system that provides free, automatic upgrades, letting supports start the rest of their build earlier. (This should also lead to more build diversity between champs that use the same starter.) As a trade-off, Tribute no longer damages and Spoils of War no longer heals, so supports will have less impact in the early lane phase.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tiers</b>
      </p>
      <p>HOW SATISFYING :: Support items still have three tiers, but now upgrade automatically <b>for free</b> as you complete their quests</p>
      <p>TIER 1 :: 400 gold starting item. Earn gold with Tribute or Spoils of War to upgrade.</p>
      <p>TIER 2 :: Increased stats and 3 ward charges. Earn gold with Tribute or Spoils of War to upgrade.</p>
      <p>TIER 3 :: Significantly increased stats and 4 total ward charges. Tribute or Spoils of War go away.</p>
      <p>CUMULATIVE COST :: 1800 gold &gt;&gt;&gt; 400 gold</p>
      <p>
        <b>Anti-Poaching</b>
      </p>
      <p>EAT THE RICH :: Farming more than 20 CS per 5 minutes <i>(3 out of 10 waves)</i> reduces gold from minions by 50%. The penalty increases with further CS to a max of 80% reduction at 50 minions.</p>
      <p>MATH :: Once the penalty kicks in, your CS gold is reduced to (70 - CS within 5 minutes)%</p>

      <h3>Energized &amp; Crit Items</h3>
      <p>We’ve struggled in the past to differentiate Energized builds from traditional crit, given that Statikk Shiv and Rapid Firecannon occupy both spaces and the only other Energized item is Stormrazor. This time, we’re embracing the overlap and the goal of our changes is to make Energized a slightly more mid-game-oriented flavor of crit, rather than its own thing entirely. Energized is about the occasional massive hit rather than a non-stop barrage of consistently strong attacks. To that end, we’re lowering the gap between how many procs users get from moving versus attacking—attack speed was giving drastically more procs, making hit-and-run playstyles too ineffective by comparison.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Energized</b>
      </p>
      <p>ZAP :: Damage from Energized effects now stacks, rather than choosing the highest-damage source</p>
      <p>KEEP MOVING :: Energized charges from moving increased by 20%; charges from attacking reduced by 50%</p>
      <p>DEMOLITIONIST :: Energized effects now always work on turrets</p>
      <p>
        <b>[UPD] Stormrazor</b>
      </p>
      <p>[S] Energized damage increased. Slow is stronger but shorter. Now grants crit chance. Attack damage, attack speed decreased. Build path updated, cost increased.</p>
      <p>[C] The absence of crit chance on Stormrazor was the biggest impediment toward Energized working as a crit variant. Adding it in means players can go for Energized builds without having to trade away their crit progression. Per the simplification note above, we’ve removed Stormrazor’s amp on other Energized sources and sharpened its slow to a stronger, shorter effect that offers more play-around opportunities.</p>

      <h3>Runes</h3>
      <h4>[REM] Kleptomancy</h4>
      <p>Kleptomancy was designed as a rune that (a) allowed users to build a gold advantage over opponents at the cost of the immediate power other keystones provide, and (b) created moment-to-moment changes in laning dynamics depending on what you got from procs. The experience Klepto created for opponents, however—be farmed for gold by constant harass damage—has been rough, especially for ranged vs melee matchups. Removing gold as an incentive only left the moment-to-moment dynamic changes as Klepto’s design core, and League’s consumable item system isn’t deep enough to carry an entire keystone on its back. Sorry, Klepto—even for an Inspiration rune, you were too weird.</p>
      <h4>[NEW] Prototype: Omnistone</h4>
      <p>Periodically gain a single use of another random keystone.</p>
      <p>ROULETTE :: Periodically gain a single use of another random keystone. Once a keystone is rolled, it can’t be rolled again until only three options are left, at which point the table resets (you won’t get the keystone you just used, though).</p>
      <p>COOLDOWN :: Gain a new keystone 8-4 seconds (melee, lv 1-18) or 12-8 seconds (ranged, lv 1-18) after using the last. Scaling is weighted toward later levels.</p>
      <p>AUTO-REROLL :: Gain a new keystone while out of combat after 40 seconds of not using a keystone</p>
