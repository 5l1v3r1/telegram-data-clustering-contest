      <h2>Derby County latest | A regularly-updated guide of when the Rams will next be on television and how to watch both live action and highlights, as Phillip Cocu's side look to climb the Championship table</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Nicholson</a></address>
      <p>Derby County continue to be a regular presence on Sky Sports' coverage of the Championship - and there are more televised games on the way for Phillip Cocu's side.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Rams </a>have already been on the box five times in the league this season, the most recent being the East Midlands derby defeat to Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>Before that, the opening-day win over Huddersfield Town was followed by draws against West Bromwich Albion, Cardiff City and Leeds United on the box.</p>
      <p>We will keep this story regularly updated so you know when Derby are next on your screens.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The next selected TV match for the Rams is home to Sheffield Wednesday on Wednesday December 11.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Derby will also feature live on Sky Sports a couple of times over the Christmas period, including their first match of 2020 against Barnsley, which could see new signing Wayne Rooney make his Rams debut.</p>
      <p>All midweek Championship games are screened on the red button as part of a deal with the EFL which began last season.</p>
      <p>Red button events are not available via Sky Go or the Sky Q app - but you can watch midweek Sky Bet Championship matches via the Sky Sports app.</p>
