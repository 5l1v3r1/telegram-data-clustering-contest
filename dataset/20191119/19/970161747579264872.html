        <b>Chrissy Teigen slams people claiming husband John Legend ‘ruined Christmas’ for his remake of Baby, It’s Cold Outside.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Sports Illustrated model had no time for people attacking her husband – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/chrissy-teigen-fulfils-dream-boning-sexiest-man-alive-john-legend-honoured-people-title-11088683/">who is PEOPLE’s sexiest man alive</a>, by the way – and told everyone to ‘get over it’.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Kelly Clarkson (who also features on the song), the 33-year-old sarcastically mocked the critics: ‘If I can’t have my creepy song, it’s not Christmas! I want date-rapey songs!’</p>
      <p>Kelly ranted: ‘People got so mad. He had this idea – with the #MeToo movement they pulled Baby, It’s Cold Outside from any radio, like a lot of radio stations at Christmas.</p>
      <p>‘We like the original but we noticed that a lot of people didn’t and we thought we’d give them another option.’</p>
      <p>The interview comes after Sharon Osbourne, 67, slammed John and Kelly for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/christmas-classic-kelly-clarkson-john-legend-given-metoo-remake-new-lyrics-11002373/">changing the song</a>, believing that no one should change a song just because they find it offensive.</p>

      <p>Chrissy continued: ‘I hear it all. It’s hard to offend me. I wasn’t mad about the song and I don’t care what you guys do but to be like, “Ooh, I hate this now”. Oh my God, get over it.’</p>

      <p>Sharon attacked the two for changing the original lyrics which included ‘say, what’s in this drink?’ after Dean Martin sings about pouring her something, as well as the multiple ‘no, no, no’s’ in the song which could be misinterpreted really badly.</p>
      <p>She went on: ‘What would John Legend do, if in 40 years, if somebody wanted to… re-record one of his songs, and there was some group that found it offensive, and somebody just went, “Oh, I can change the lyrics on that”.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a piece of art… to change an innocent lyric, to what is it, “your mind and your body?” What the hell are you on? That’s ridiculous.’</p>
      <p>The lyrics the X Factor judge is referring to is when Kelly sings: ‘If I have one more drink?’ to which John sings: ‘It’s your body and your choice’.</p>
