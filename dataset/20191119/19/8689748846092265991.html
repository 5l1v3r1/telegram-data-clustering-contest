      <p>Responding to this in an interview with Zionfelix on Radio Univers’ ‘Brunch2Lunch’ Entertainment show, Brother Sammy  said its only new artistes who will make such assumptions.</p>
      <p>According to brother Sammy, new artists should not expect to be at the level the established have reached within a short period of time.</p>
      <p>Brother Sammy further disclosed that some artistes  like Ohemaa Mercy who have been in the industry for long charge 40000 cedis for an appearance at any program.  This is enough proof that the Ghanaian gospel industry does pay.</p>
      <p>Brother Sammy’s new album launch comes off this weekend at the Dichemso Assemblies of God Church in Kumasi.</p>
