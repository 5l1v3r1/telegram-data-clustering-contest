      <p>“In short, he has been a constant on the field.</p>
      <p>“He is the only defender to have scored at least one goal in the last seven seasons of Serie A, and whilst wearing the Black and White jersey, he has scored 17 times.”</p>
      <p>Bonucci has won 14 trophies in total with Juventus since arriving from southerners Bari in 2010, including seven Scudetto titles.</p>
      <p>This season he has been promoted to captain while Giorgio Chiellini recovers from injury.</p>
