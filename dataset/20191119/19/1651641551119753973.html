      <p>Microsoft today announced the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Discussions/Dev-channel-update-to-80-0-334-2-is-live/m-p/1018372">release</a> of new v80.0.334.2 update for Edge Dev channel. The update comes with two new improvements and several bug fixes. First, Microsoft has added a right-click option that will allow you to sort individual favorites folders by name from the Favorites management page. Second, there is a new setting that will allow you to set Strict Tracking Prevention inside InPrivate windows. Microsoft also mentioned that they have temporarily disabled sync to prevent data duplication.</p>

In one case, Edge becomes muted in the Windows Volume Mixer and unmuting it fixes it.  In another, restarting the browser fixes it.<br/>   •  At certain zoom levels, there is a noticeable line between the browser UI and the web contents.<br/>   •  Last month, some users got a “Work” account automatically added to the browser that wasn’t removable. Although we recently enabled the ability for some users to remove this account, there’s still an issue where users who are signed into Windows with a work or school account may not be able to remove that account from the browser.<br/>   •  Clicking a link on one virtual desktop currently opens a new tab in a window on a different virtual desktop if there’s no window open on the current desktop but there is on another. This is a regression from past behavior, which opened a new window on the current desktop.<br/>   •  Jumplist entries are not consistent between the Start Menu and the Task Bar for some users. We believe this is due to the shortcut on the Start Menu not getting migrated properly after an Edge update and are working on a fix.  Additionally, after getting the update for the new icon, there are still places on the Start Menu, for example when searching, that still show the old icon. Other places like the Task Bar may be able to be fixed by un-pinning and then re-pinning any Edge shortcuts that already exist there.<br/>   •  Sometimes the browser will appear to not respond to any user input (clicking or scrolling in webpages doesn’t do anything, hovering over UI doesn’t make it change), but clicking on certain buttons still works (like the … menu). The cause of this is due to an error in the GPU process, and opening the browser task manager (right-click near the window minimize/maximize/close buttons or hit shift+esc on the keyboard) will open a window that will allow you to end the GPU process, which will fix the issue.  This issue was inherited from upstream Chromium, and a fix for it just went in upstream, so the next Dev update should have it.</blockquote>
      <p>The update should download and install directly but in case it doesn’t then you can head to the Edge settings and manually update the browser.</p>
