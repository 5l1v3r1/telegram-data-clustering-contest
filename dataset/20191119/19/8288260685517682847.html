      <p>The majority of Liverpool’s senior squad is expected to travel to Doha with fringe players and academy talents taking on Villa – and Netherlands international Wijnaldum knows where he will be.</p>
      <p>“I’m really looking forward to playing in the World Cup for teams because back in the day I saw the Champions League winners play in the competition,” he said.</p>
      <p>“What I like the most is that if you win, you get a badge on your shirt. That’s something you want to achieve. I saw it on a few shirts of the previous winners.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Also, when I speak about the tournament with family and friends, they all speak about the badge. That’s something you want; every time you look at the shirt it reminds you that you won the World Cup for teams.</p>
      <p>“You go into football to make history and that’s what we want to achieve with the team we’re playing in. We have a good team.”</p>
