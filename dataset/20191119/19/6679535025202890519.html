      <p>Enforcement teams of the GHMC have swooped down on illegal banners and flexi boards in the city at multiple locations, and taken them down along with illegal sign boards.</p>
      <h3>Welcome move</h3>
      <p>In accordance with the decision taken during recent city convergence meeting, the teams under the Enforcement, Vigilance and Disaster Management director Viswajit Kampati, have initiated a special drive to remove the unauthorised banners and flexis.</p>
      <p>A total of 9,000 posters, banners and flexis have been removed from various locations across the city on the first day of the drive, with participation from 24 enforcement teams, a press statement from GHMC informed. Sign boards which have been occupying the footpaths too have been uprooted as part of the drive, it said.</p>
      <p>GHMC has taken up several special drives, respectively to collect discarded articles, to lift construction and demolition debris from roads and lakes, and to clean up the city roads of garbage.</p>
      <h3>Strict penalty</h3>
      <p>Officials have informed that the clean up drives are in preparation for implementation of penalty regimen even more strictly, to dissuade public from defacing the city.</p>
      <p>Already penalties are being levied for random offences, such as littering the roads, dumping in nalas, and leaving debris out in open, among other violations.</p>
