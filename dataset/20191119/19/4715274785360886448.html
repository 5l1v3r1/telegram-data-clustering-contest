      <p>Anastasia Beverly Hills or ABH is popular for its cult-favorite eyebrow products loved by professional makeup artists, celebrities, and beauty junkies worldwide. In fact, its bestselling Dipbrow Pomade is one of the most copied makeup products. </p>
      <p>In addition to Dipbrow Pomade, the American cosmetics brand has also received numerous accolades for Brow Wiz, another eyebrow product. </p>
      <p>With eyebrows on focus, ABH has introduced and patented its brow-shaping service dubbed “Golden Ratio Eyebrow Shaping Method,” which aims to find balance and symmetry through arches that perfectly frame a person’s face shape. </p>

      <p>Prior to the opening of its first kiosk in Manila, fans and curious shoppers had to order online or ask someone going abroad to hoard for them.</p>
      <p>Finally, at the Rustan’s Makati outlet there is Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow Pomade, a full-pigment, waterproof pomade that can be used to fill in and detail brows. With a long-lasting and “buildable” formula, the product glides on effortlessly, dries down completely, and stays put for hours. </p>
