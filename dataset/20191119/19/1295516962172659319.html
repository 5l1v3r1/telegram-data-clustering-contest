      <h1>Crisis' Monitor Teases 'Funny Interaction' With Other Arrowverse Character</h1>

      <p>The Monitor isn't exactly known for his comedic relief, but he'll be the source of some humor in an upcoming <i>Arrow</i>verse series. Speaking to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/crisis-infinite-earths-lamonica-garrett-anti-monitor-interview/">CBR</a>, "Crisis on Infinite Earths" star LaMonica Garrett teased that another character will have a "humorous" reaction to meeting the Monitor.</p>
      <p>Asked about his favorite <i>Arrow</i>verse moment so far, he pointed to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/arrow-lyla-michaels-harbinger-always-worked-monitor/">the Monitor's meeting with Lyla Michaels</a>. "Probably my favorite moment and scene was that meeting in little alley with Lyla Michaels, the Harbinger," he mused. "That just happened, but that was one I was geeked out about when I read that."</p>

      <p>However, he did include a tease about a moment yet to come, saying, "There's moments coming up with other characters that it's going to be -- well, no, I don't want to say that. There's a spoiler, but it's something coming that's a funny interaction that starts out funny with one of the characters and then it takes another serious turn because that's what the Monitor does. The reaction of one of the characters when they meet him for the first time, it's going to be humorous."</p>
      <p>In the <i>Arrow</i>verse to date, the Monitor has only really interacted with a handful of characters. He stood against Green Arrow, the Flash and Supergirl in "Elseworlds," last year's crossover. As revealed in an episode of <i>Arrow</i>, he has also been working with A.R.G.U.S. director Lyla Michaels for some time now. Additionally, he <a href="https://www.cbr.com/arrow-monitor-laurel-lance-deal/">recently approached</a> Laurel Lance and told her he would restore Earth-2 if she betrays Oliver.</p>

      <p>This leaves a lot of characters that Garrett could be referring to. However, a likely suspect is John Diggle, Oliver's longtime ally and friend. After all, he has a history of struggling to come to terms with metahumans and the other fantastical elements of the <i>Arrow</i>verse. It stands to reason he may have some trouble adjusting to the Monitor.</p>
      <p>"Crisis on Infinite Earths" begins Sunday, Dec. 8 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on <i>Supergirl</i>, then continues in <i>Batwoman</i> on Monday, Dec. p at 8 p.m. ET/PT and in <i>The Flash</i> on Tuesday, Dec, 10 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. After the winter hiatus, the crossover will conclude on Tuesday, Jan. 14 in <i>Arrow</i> at 8 p.m. ET/PT and in <i>DC's Legends of Tomorrow</i> at 9 p.m. ET/PT.</p>
