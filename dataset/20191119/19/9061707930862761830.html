      <h1>Derby care home to close due over 'minuscule' council funding</h1>
      <h2>Residents and staff have been notified today</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:59:13+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:59</time> by <a rel="author">John Grant</a></address>
      <p>Residents and staff at a Derby care home have received notice that the facility is to close.</p>
      <p>The Florence Nightingale Care Home, on Village Street, Derby will close in four weeks after its director Neil Vickers said running it had become unsustainable.</p>
      <p>He said he had attended a meeting with <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-city-council">Derby City Council</a> officials hoping for more money to help keep the care home, which he says has been losing money for the last three to four years, afloat.</p>
      <p>Mr Vickers, who has run the care home since 2013, said: "We were hanging on to see what the council would give us for next year. What they've given us is minuscule really. We've always asked for increased funding."</p>
      <p>The council has said it has not been formally notified about the closure, but its annual consultation with care home owners is ongoing.</p>
      <p>The businessman has been running care homes for decades. He said: "I've never seen it this bad in 28 years.</p>
      <p>"They have not increased the funding properly to make it profitable. I told them, I'm not a charity or a council, I am a businessman.</p>
      <p>"I have to make money or I'll go skint. I support that care home with my other businesses.</p>
      <p>"If you don't fund these care homes we won't have anywhere for our elderly people. If all the care homes in Derby close down, where would you put these people?"</p>
      <p>Mr Vickers said the Florence Nightingale is constantly losing money despite currently being full.</p>
      <p>He said: "We are full with 20 residents and we've still had to shut it, I cannot sustain that business anymore. Care homes are massively underfunded and we will all pay the price for it.</p>
      <p>"I'm really sad to give this notice."</p>
      <p>Along with the residents, 20 staff members have been given notice of the closure, which will take place in four weeks.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Derby City Council said: “The council has not been formally advised of any notice of closure for the Florence Nightingale Care Home.</p>
      <p>"We are in a consultation phase with care homes about the standard residential and nursing fees for 2020/21. This is an annual process the council engages in with the sector.</p>
      <p>"This does not propose any cuts to fees, in fact no fee rates for 2020/21 have been proposed to the sector as yet.</p>
      <p>“The care home owners have been asked to raise their cost pressures with the council and they have until November 26 to do that.</p>
      <p>"We are happy to open up discussions about how the council can support the sector with their cost pressures, which is the purpose of the consultation period we are engaged in.”</p>
