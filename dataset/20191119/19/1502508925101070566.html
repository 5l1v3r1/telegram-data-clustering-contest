      <p>Lenders to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jet-airways">Jet Airways </a>have agreed to give the Synergy Group time till December 16 to submit a resolution plan to revive the grounded airline.</p>
      <p>The proposal was discussed at the committee of creditors meeting in Mumbai on Tuesday and will be put to vote for a formal approval in the next few days. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) requires completion of a resolution process within 180 days.</p>
      <p>The code also provides for further extension. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jet-airways">Jet Airways </a>came under insolvency proceedings in June and the airline’s resolution professional Ashish Chhawchharia will make an application to the insolvency court seeking a 90-day extension in the resolution timeline. South America’s Synergy Group is the sole contender to revive the grounded airline.</p>
      <p>It had been given time till November 15 to submit its bid. However, the group sought more time as it seeks clarity on airport slots in India and London.</p>
      <p>The group has been in regular touch with the resolution professional and the airline management, giving hopes of a revival. The Mumbai Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has sought an interaction with the Synergy Group by December 3 to understand its interest in restarting Jet.</p>
