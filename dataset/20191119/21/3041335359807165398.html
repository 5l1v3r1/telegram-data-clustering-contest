      <p>Our politicians until now had become accustomed to honouring the spirit and memory of the 1973 Athens Polytechnic uprising against the junta.</p>
      <p> Today one sadly observes that the main opposition leader diverged from that rule and from the respect to which history is entitled.</p>
      <p>

      <p> Unfortunately, he forgot the heroic sacrifices of the Athens Polytechnic students in order to degrade Sunday’s march by treating it as a mere ant-government protest.</p>
      <p> The leader of SYRIZA protested in an upbeat manner and yesterday said he was annoyed by <i>Ta Nea’s</i> front page. It is not only his distaste for press criticism that impresses one as that has been exhibited many times, even when the criticism is justified.</p>
      <p> One is justified in wondering how a politician who sang the praises of President Trump participated in a march the destination of which is the US Embassy and which aims to strongly condemn US policy.</p>
      <p> It is also noteworthy that the leader of SYRIZA attempted to cut down to size the historic Polytechnic march to suit his objectives.</p>
      <p> What kind of anti-government march could it be that he abandons half-way through? Why did the aspiring leader of the ant-government front do that, abandoning the supposed anti-government protesters?</p>
      <p> One raises these questions to show that such efforts are untenable.</p>
      <p> The leader of SYRIZA is not obliged to answer.</p>
      <p> Yet he has a duty to respect his institutional role and above all historical memory.</p>
