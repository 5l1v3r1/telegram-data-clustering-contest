      <p>Gary Lineker has slammed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> for sacking <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> and insists the club will fail to find a manager more suitable for the position than the Argentine.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/mauricio-pochettino-sacked-tottenham-extremely-disappointing-results-11184337/">Spurs released a statement on Tuesday evening</a> confirming that Pochettino had been ‘relieved of his duties’ after five years in the hot seat, along with his coaching staff Jesus Perez, Miguel D’Agostino and Antoni Jimenez.</p>
      <p>Pochettino found himself under pressure after a dismal start to the season in which Tottenham have struggled to live up to their heights of last term when they reached the Champions League final and finished fourth in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>He departs with Spurs sitting just six points above the relegation down in 14th. Former Manchester United and Chelsea boss <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/jose-mourinho-odds-favourite-become-tottenham-manager-mauricio-pochettino-sacking-11184338/">Jose Mourinho is the overwhelming favourite to take over the reins in north London.</a></p>

      <p>‘Mauricio Pochettino has been sacked by Spurs. He helped the club to punch massively above their weight for years,’ the ex-Spurs and England striker tweeted following Tottenham’s statement.</p>
      <p>‘Good luck with finding a better replacement….ain’t gonna happen.’</p>

      <p>Former Spurs boss Harry Redknapp believes the players were largely to blame for Pochettino’s dismissal.</p>
      <p>‘People talk about the players there all loving him – if they love him that much, maybe they should have started playing a bit better. At the end of the day, they’ve got him the sack.</p>
      <p>‘The results have not been good enough. They’ve not performed well enough. That’s what gets you sacked as a football manager.</p>
      <p>‘They’ve had one Champions League final, and if you look back at the run, really, everything went their way a little bit.</p>
      <p>‘But they’ve not won a trophy in five or six years with an incredible squad of players, full of internationals.’</p>

      <p>Asked if he would consider a return to Tottenham, Redknapp replied: ‘I don’t live in cuckoo land.</p>
      <p>‘But I’d walk there if they offered it.’</p>
