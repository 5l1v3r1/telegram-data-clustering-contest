      <p>A video surfaced earlier today showing BH, a close friend of Nipsey Hussle and artist on the All $ In label, being pulled over by several police squad cars and asked to exit his vehicle. The video shows BH with his hands up while backing up before the cops undoubtedly handcuffed him. While BH was clearly perturbed by the situation, the onlookers who recorded the encounter seemed to find some humor in the whole thing.Â </p>
