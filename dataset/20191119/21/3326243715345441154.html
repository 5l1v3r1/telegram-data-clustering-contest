      <p>More often than not, a company will uncover all of the new and noteworthy features in a new product on its own, with subsequent investigations of the new hardware or software confirming those details. But it looks like the brand new 16-inch <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> has a small surprise for us.</p>
      <p>If you’ll recall, the fine folks over at <i>iFixit </i>recently gave the new 16-inch MacBook Pro the full <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/18/ifixit-16-macbook-pro-full-teardown/">teardown treatment</a>. That revealed the larger battery, gave us details about the new Magic Keyboard with its scissor design, and a look at the new thermal design for good measure. But now a new sensor has <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+16-Inch+2019+Teardown/128106#s250599">been discovered</a>. You can see it pictured above.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/19/16-inch-macbook-pro-lid-angle-sensor/"><i>MacRumors</i></a> recently got a look at an internal document originally sent to Authorized Service Providers, which makes note of a “lid angle sensor” as part of the pieces that make up the full 16-inch MacBook Pro. According to the report, the new sensor presumably monitors the open and/or closed state of the new MacBook Pro.</p>
      <p><i>iFixit</i> updated its teardown to include images of the sensor, and you can see it at the top of this article. The sensor is placed near the left-side hinge of the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which features a magnet embedded in the hinge itself.</p>
      <blockquote>While previous-generation MacBook Pro models have a Hall effect sensor that determines when the lid is closed for sleep/wake purposes, the lid angle sensor in the 16-inch MacBook Pro appears to be more sophisticated.<br/>Apple’s service document does not provide any clues as to why the sensor was redesigned, but iFixit speculates that it could provide a clever way for Apple to track how often the lid was opened, closed, or adjusted in cases where the display or frayed flex cables need to be repaired — think “Flexgate.”</blockquote>
      <p>It’s also possible that this new sensor could be tied to a new feature that could be built into macOS at some point in the future, but there’s definitely no indication of that being the case right now.</p>
      <p>And for an Authorized Service Provider to complete the repair process itself, both the display and the new lid angle sensor must be calibrated.</p>
      <p>So, a secret sensor! That’s exciting! Well, if it actually turns into something at some point down the road. Then again, it could be absolutely nothing.</p>
      <p>Let us know what you think this new lid angle sensor could be tied to down in the comments below.</p>
