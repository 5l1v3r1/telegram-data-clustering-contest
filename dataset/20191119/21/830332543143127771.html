      <p>MADISON, Wis. - The Republican co-chair of the Legislature's budget committee has filed a lawsuit seeking to force Gov. Tony Evers to release records related to the funding of farmer mental health programs.</p>
      <p>Rep. John Nygren, of Marinette, filed the lawsuit Tuesday in Dane County Circuit Court. Evers' spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff declined immediate comment because the governor had not yet been served with the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit continues a fight between the Republican-controlled Legislature and the Democrat Evers over $100,000 in funding for farmer mental health programs.</p>
      <p>The state agriculture department requested the Legislature's budget committee release the funding in July. In August, Nygren filed open records requests with both the agency and Evers seeking records covering nine subject areas related to the request.</p>
      <p>Nygren says in the lawsuit Evers rejected his request as overly broad, while the agriculture department fulfilled it.</p>
