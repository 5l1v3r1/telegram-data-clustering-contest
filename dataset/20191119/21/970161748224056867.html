      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/declan-donnelly/">Declan Donnelly</a> couldn’t help but make a dig towards Prime Minister Boris Johnson on tonight’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…Get Me Out Of Here.</p>
      <p>The reality show followed a live debate held between the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/johnson-corbyn-clash-general-election-debate-11184324/">Prime Minister and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on ITV.</a></p>
      <p>However the two men, who are most likely to lead the country after the December 12 vote clashed on Brexit, the NHS, the royal family, and the union – but shook hands at one stage.</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec couldn’t help but make light of the situation by throwing some jokes in there about it as they introduced I’m A Celeb.</p>
      <p>‘Two camps are about to come one, but first there’s work to be done,’ Ant began.</p>
      <p>‘Which means five of them are about to face their deepest fears,’ Dec continued.</p>

      <p>Ant joked: ‘Welcome to Australia and another TV show where two men like the sound of their own voices.’</p>

      <p>‘Evening Prime Minister…for now,’ Dec laughed.</p>
      <p>Ant then interrupted as he listened into his ear piece, he continued: ‘Hang on, hang on, I am just hearing that even this show must remain politically impartial.’</p>
      <p>Dec responded: ‘You’re right, good evening Prime Minister for now, and good evening bloke who wants to be Prime Minister, although why anyone who would want that job is beyond me.’</p>
      <p>The jokers continued as Ant said: ‘Caitlin proved there’s nothing worse than someone going on and on and on and not listening to a word you say.’</p>
      <p>Dec interjected: ‘Again evening Prime Minister and bloke who wants to be Prime Minister.’</p>
