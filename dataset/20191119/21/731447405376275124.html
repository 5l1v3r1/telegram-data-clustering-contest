      <p>San Francisco collective <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/promoter.aspx?id=72410">Noctuary SF</a> is starting a series of community forums. <br/><br/>Launching on December 5th at <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/club.aspx?id=87439">Vinyl Dreams</a>, the first Workshop Sessions will cover harm reduction in nightlife spaces. Talks will be led by Justin Talbot, the former head of the Bay Area Chapter of DanceSafe. The discussions will include information on testing kits, safe drug combos, and how to help others going through a difficult experience. Forthcoming events will address topics such as DJ skills, networking, navigating the music industry, dance music history and more. <br/><br/>Founded in 2016, Noctuary SF is a San Francisco-based collective providing a platform for non-cis men in the electronic music industry. <br/><br/>Check out the workshops <a href="https://noctuarysf.com/workshops">here</a>.</p>
