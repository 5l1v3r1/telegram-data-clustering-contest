      </h3>
      <p>The contract for the €3 billion National Broadband Plan has been signed by the Government.</p>

      <p>The plan received approval from the Cabinet this morning after the EU last week ruled the plan complies with state aid rules.</p>

      <p>He has gone head to head with UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in the first live TV debate of the campaign there.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn, meanwhile, promised to deliver on the results of a second EU referendum if his party wins.</p>

      <p>The ambassador of the State of Palestine to Ireland has welcomed the Government's commitment, following a change of US policy on illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank.</p>
      <p>The administration of US President Donald Trump has declared that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are not illegal.</p>
      <p>This is a shift in decades-long US policy in the Middle East. It is feared the move could stoke tensions in the area.</p>

      <p>Aoife Bennett from Naas, Co Kildare told the court she couldn't get out of bed after getting the vaccine and was eventually diagnosed with the sleep disorder.</p>
      <p>This case began last month and was expected to take up to ten weeks at a cost of millions of euro.</p>

      <p>It will see gift vouchers have an expiry date of at least five years from the date of contract.</p>
