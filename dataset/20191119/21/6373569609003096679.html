      <p>Amazing Plymouth people have made donations to the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal this week, after Plymouth Live reported that money was stolen from a poppy collection box at a Plymouth GP surgery.</p>
      <p>Steve Wise, 58, from <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/whitleigh">Whitleigh</a>, has donated £100 to make up for the stolen cash, after reading the Plymouth Live article about the <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/scumbag-who-stole-poppy-collection-3525285">'scumbag' who stole the collection money</a> from Knowle House Surgery in Plymouth.</p>
      <p>While local artist Stevie of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/392620274727508/">S.P art</a>, has donated an original piece of artwork to the surgery, which will be raffled off to raise funds for the Poppy Appeal.</p>
      <p>Steve Wise, who is the director of family-run Oakley Builders &amp; Groundwork Contractors Ltd. based in Scott Business Park, told Plymouth Live he wanted to ensure the The Royal British Legion 'still get the money they deserve'.</p>
      <p>He said: "I cannot believe someone can be so low and heartless to steal from such a worthy cause, a charity which helps our armed forces community.</p>
      <p>"It's unfair that this person has stolen from their doctor's surgery - which was working hard to raise money - but they have also stolen from a charity which, as far as I'm concerned, is the lowest you can go.</p>
      <p>"It's not the surgery's fault it can't submit its donations now, so I want to make a contribution on behalf of Oakley Builders so the Royal British Legion still get the money they deserve and Knowle House Surgery can still get their recognition for their donation"</p>
      <p>Steve is 'very passionate' about the Poppy Appeal and the good it does for veterans and their families, says Oakley Builders staff member Fay Targett, and notes that many members of Oakley staff have armed forces connections through family and friends.</p>
      <p>Steve's grandfather was also a Tank Commander during World War II and his grandmother worked for the armed forces in the kitchens.</p>
      <p>Fay added: "Us ladies in the office feel very touched Steve wants to help the surgery and the Poppy Appeal after this cruel person stole from the charity. We can only hope they come to their senses and return the money to the surgery."</p>
      <p>Local lady Stevie of S.P art has also been thanked for creating a wonderful piece of original artwork inspired by poppies and Plymouth Hoe.</p>
      <p>Her artwork will be raffled off to raise funds for The Poppy Appeal.</p>
      <p>Tickets for the raffle are £5 each and the raffle will be held on Monday, December 23.</p>
