      <p>Stormzy has given the people what they want by announcing his second studio album, Heavy Is The Head.</p>
      <p>After one heck of a successful year, including that showstopping <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/glastonbury/">Glastonbury</a> performance, the 26-year-old is rounding up the decade with his next release.</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, the rapper confirmed the news to his 2.6million followers, and it already looks iconic.</p>
      <p>Sharing a picture of the cover, which features the star holding onto the bulletproof vest he wore at the summer festival, the Shut Up hitmaker wrote: ‘HEAVY IS THE HEAD, 13th DECEMBER. (PRE ORDER LINK IN MY BIO).’</p>
      <p>Right on cue, fans rushed to the comments section where they couldn’t control their excitement.</p>
      <p>‘This will be proper,’ one wrote, while another added: ‘ITS COMING , A F**KING ALBUM NO WAY OH LORD.’</p>

      <p>Alongside the cover, Stormzy had also dropped the tracklisting, and there’s a number of collabs to get excited about.</p>
      <p>As the second song on the list, titled Audacity, features Headie One, the star also revealed he’d worked with H.E.R on the upcoming hit One Second.</p>
      <p>But it was number 11 that caught our eye, as Mr. Ed Sheeran’s name features alongside Burna Boy on the new track Own It.</p>

      <p>It’s clear that 2019 has been Stormzy’s year seeing him make history at Glastonbury <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/10/stormzy-overwhelmed-lands-time-magazine-cover-cant-even-comprehend-10896132/">as well as land the cover of Time magazine.</a></p>
      <p>Addressing his achievements, the star, whose real name is Michael Omari, wrote: ‘One of my absolute proudest moments. I can’t even comprehend this. I am on the cover of TIME.’</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘I’ve stared at this cover for a few minutes and it feels like one of those “how the f***kkkk did man get here?!” moments.</p>
      <p>‘God’s favour and the ever lasting love and support you guys show me has elevated me to a place in life where this South London kid is worthy enough to grace the cover of the most prestigious publication in the World.’</p>
      <p>Thanking TIME and God for the ‘huge honour’ of being named a Next Generation Leader, the Vossi Bop rapper continued: ‘Anyone who knows me knows how much I shy away from being anything other than “Mike”.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘The thought of being a “role model” or “leader” or whatever it is can often feel way way way too heavy and too overwhelming and a lot of the time […] I can’t even bare the weight of being myself let alone any of these other titles.’</p>
