      <p>UNR came out strong when the teams met in the 2018 season finale, hitting the Rebels with five plays of at least 24 yards, including three touchdowns — all in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>The Wolf Pack were more than having their way in breaking out to a 23-0 lead.</p>
      <p>But UNLV came roaring back in the Nov. 24 game, and behind quarterback Armani Rogers’ five touchdowns (three passing, two rushing), the Rebels pulled off their largest comeback <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/unlv/unlv-football/armani-rogers-5-tds-rally-unlv-past-unr-34-29-1535045/">in winning </a><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/unlv/unlv-football/armani-rogers-5-tds-rally-unlv-past-unr-34-29-1535045/">34-29</a>. They previously rallied from 21 points down twice.</p>
      <p>Rogers completed 13 of 20 passes for 172 as UNLV finished 4-8.</p>
      <p>“The game was bigger for me, and I wanted to do it for the team and the city around us,” he said afterward. “It’s a big accomplishment for us, especially how the season has been going. It shows the fight we have in us.”</p>
      <p>Though Rogers keyed the rally from an offensive standpoint, linebacker Javin White sealed it on the defensive side.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/unlv/unlv-football/javin-whites-2-interceptions-help-unlv-beat-unr-1535356/">intercepted two passes</a> in the fourth quarter. The first was with 6:02 remaining as UNR was driving to try to extend its 29-28 lead. White’s other interception came with 1:19 left and the Rebels holding on to their five-point lead. He picked off the pass at UNLV’s 18-yard line and quickly went to the ground.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been in positions like this a lot this season,” White said afterward. “Coach (Tim Skipper) always talks about, ‘Keep your composure, and big-time players make big-time plays.’ ”</p>
