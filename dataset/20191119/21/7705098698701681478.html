      <h1>Avengers: Damage Control VR Experience Will Run Into 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:02:59+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:02</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>Last month, Marvel announced a <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/video-games/468463-avengers-get-a-vr-experience-at-the-void">VR experience</a> called <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/damage-control"><b>Avengers: Damage Control</b></a>. It puts players in an entirely new scenario with MCU heroes as they face Ultron. It was originally supposed to run through the end of this year. However, it’s not going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
      <p>Marvel and ILMxLab have announced that the interactive experience will continue at various VOID locations. Although there’s not an end date yet, <b>Damage Control</b> will run through at least the end of January 2020. </p>
      <p>For those that missed it, <b>Damage Control</b> puts players inside Emergency Response Suits. They were assembled by Shuri (Letitia Wright) using Wakandan and Stark tech. Players will need to test the suits as a new threat emerges, taking them to familiar locations from the MCU. <b>Damage </b><b>Control</b> also features the return of Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, and Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp.</p>
