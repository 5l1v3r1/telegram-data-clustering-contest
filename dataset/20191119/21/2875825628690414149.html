      <p>Adele Roberts and Roman Kemp were embroiled in the first heated row of this year's I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>The first argument of the series kick off in dramatic style when Adele started bickering with Roman over a very serious topic.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> ? The upcoming election? Who will win the Premier League? No...they actually got into a vicious row over JANE MCDONALD.</p>
      <p>An initial squabble over the cruise ship queen turned very sour when furious Adele accuses Roman of "prejudice" when he offended Jane.</p>
      <p>Stunned Roman immediately apologised, but the tension remained as the pair get into a confrontation over a photo of the former Loose Women star.</p>

      <p>The clash started when Roman admitted he was puzzled why Adele chose a picture of Jane McDonald as her luxury item.</p>
      <p>When asked if she knows any of her songs, Adele said: “I know her off Loose Women, I don’t know her actual songs but I know her from the cruising show when she does covers.”</p>
      <p>Giggling Roman caused offence when he claimed: "No one knows what she does."</p>

      <p>Kate insisted Jane was a "legend", but confused Roman replied: "She’s a legend is she? Name a song?"</p>
      <p>The Good Morning Britain presenter failed to name a song and Myles and Roman continued to laugh.</p>
      <p>This angered Adele, who explained: "She’ll cruise around the world, for example she’d go to Iceland and then sing a Bjork or would go to the USA and sing Proud Mary."</p>

      <p>When Roman repeated that it was "random", Adele asked: "Why though? I don’t understand."</p>
      <p>"But if I had brought in a picture of Ru-Paul would you have the same reaction?"</p>
      <p>Roman continued to claim it was "random", before being accused of "prejudice" by the former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> contestant.</p>
      <p>She strongly insisted: "That’s prejudice, I’m allowed to like what I want."</p>

      <p>Realising he had upset Adele, Martin Kemp's apologetic son said: "I wasn’t saying that at all, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to."</p>
      <p>But the bickering did not stop there as Roman claimed he found the situation "funny".</p>
      <p>Adele sarcastically asked: "I’m not allowed to like what I want?"</p>
      <p>The DJ got Kate's backing and Roman apologised once again for winding Adele up.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>She said: "It’s fine, you are just going on about it so much…"</p>
      <p>With the tense atmosphere unsettling the rest of the campmates - the pair agreed to put their differences aside and hugged.</p>
      <p>Kate awkwardly joked: "It’s just fun around camp."</p>
      <p>Is this the start of a major rivalry in camp?</p>
