      <h1>Trump Says He Will Hike China Tariffs If There Is No Deal | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>President Donald Trump said he would raise tariffs on Chinese goods if no trade deal is reached.</h2>

      <p>“China is going to have to make a deal that I like. If they don’t, that’s it,” Trump said Tuesday at a cabinet meeting. “If we don’t make a deal with China, I’ll just raise the tariffs even higher.”</p>
      <p>The U.S. announced that it had reached a “phase one” preliminary trade deal in October. Negotiations to finalize the deal have continued for weeks, including a call on Friday between U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and China’s Vice Premier Liu He.</p>
      <p>Chinese state media over the weekend described the Friday call as “constructive.” On Monday, however, CNBC reported that Chinese officials were pessimistic about reaching a trade deal.</p>
      <p>The existing tariffs on around $500 billion of Chinese goods appear to be the stumbling block. China wants those tariffs removed as part of the preliminary deal and said in October that a tariff rollback would be part of the deal. President Trump last week said he had not agreed to rollback tariffs.</p>
      <p>China hawks in the White House want to keep existing tariffs in place while a comprehensive deal is worked out.</p>
      <p>Despite threatening to raise tariffs, Trump insisted he gets along well with China.</p>
      <p>“Now, with that being said, I have a good relationship with China. We’ll see what happens, but I’m very happy right now,” Trump said.</p>
