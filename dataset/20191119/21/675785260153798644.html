      <h1>Harry Redknapp accuses Tottenham stars of getting Mauricio Pochettino sacked</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham have sacked Mauricio Pochettino less than six months after he took them to the Champions League final</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:23:35+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:23</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Harry Redknapp has launched a scathing attack on Tottenham's under-performing players and believes they are to blame for Mauricio Pochettino's sacking.</p>
      <p>Pochettino, along with his coaching staff, has paid the price for a poor run of domestic form in 2019, bringing an end to a five-and-a-half-year spell at the club.</p>
      <p>During that time he delivered four successive top-four finishes in the Premier League, which included two title challenges, a memorable run to the European Cup final last season and developed the likes of Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Christian Eriksen into top-class players.</p>
      <p>But Redknapp, the former Spurs manager, believes some of those players have played a role in the Argentine's shock dismissal, which was confirmed on Tuesday night.</p>

      <p><b>"</b> When people talk about the players all loving him, if they love him that much, maybe they should have all started playing a bit better," Redknapp said.</p>
      <p>"They've got him the sack, at the end of the day. They haven't performed well enough, that's why he's lost his job. If they all loved him so much, perhaps they should have done a bit better for him.</p>
      <p>"That's why you get the sack. They've had one Champions League final; if you look back at the run, everything went their way a little bit. They've not won a trophy in five or six years with an incredible set of players.</p>

      <p>"People say they need a better squad; have a look at them, they have four international full-backs, internationals all over the place, England internationals, all kinds.</p>
      <p>"And up front they're not short either. They're massively underachieving at the moment."</p>
      <p>Chairman Daniel Levy ultimately grew impatient with a decline in form this calendar year as Spurs took only 23 points from their last 24 Premier League games.</p>
      <p>They have won just three times this season and as well as a 7-2 humiliation against Bayern Munich in the Champions League last month, they were also beaten by League Two Colchester in the Carabao Cup.</p>
