      <h1>ITV Debate - revenge of the voters as Corbyn and Johnson both face laughter from studio audience</h1>
      <h2>Boris Johnson provoked laughter when he said telling the truth was important</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:10:10+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:10</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Walker, https://www.facebook.com/JonWalkerPolitics?pnref=story</a></address>
      <p>Conservative leader Boris Johnson faced laughter from a studio audience as he insisted that telling the truth was important.</p>
      <p>Asked if the truth matters in this election, he said: "I think it does" - provoking chuckles from the audience at the debate in Manchester.</p>
      <p>The humiliating moment came as he took part in the ITV debate, the first televised debate of the general election.</p>
      <p>It was also the first time ever that there has been a debate involving just the leaders of the two main parties.</p>
      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also faced laughter from the audience after he repeatedly refused to reveal whether he personally believed the UK should leave the EU or not.</p>

      <p>A Labour government will negotiate a new Brexit deal with the EU, he said, and then hold a referendum to let the public decide whether to accept it or to cancel Brexit entirely.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson repeatedly challenged Mr Corbyn to reveal whether he personally would support the deal or not - but the Labour leader refused to do so.</p>
      <p>The Conservative leader promised that his party would “get Brexit done” while Labour would give the country “dither and delay”.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But Mr Corbyn argued that even after the UK leaves, there could be years of discussion still to come over new trade deals with the EU and the US.</p>
      <p>He said:“That idea that the Prime Minister Boris Johnson’ deal can be dealt with and finished by the end of January is such nonsense.</p>
      <p>“What he is proposing is a trade deal which will take at least seven years to negotiate whilst at the same time saying he will negotiate a special trade deal with the European Union.</p>
      <p>“The two things are actually incompatible.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>A second Scottish referendum?</h3>
      <p>During the debate, Mr Johnson challenged the Labour leader to rule out holding a second Scottish independence referendum if he becomes Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>But Mr Corbyn would only say there would be no referendum “in the early years of the next Labour government”.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’ve said there would be no deal with the SNP, there would be no support for a Scottish referendum in the early years of the next Labour government because I want to invest in Scotland and give Scotland the £70 billion it needs in capital investment.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said it was “their choice” if the SNP leadership “chooses to put the Conservative government back in office”.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson added: “I listened very carefully as I always do to Mr Corbyn - I didn’t hear him say he was going to rule out a referendum on Scotland. Did you?”</p>
      <h3>The end of austerity</h3>
      <p>Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson both said austerity is over. Mr Johnson said: “I believe in spending, investing, massively in our public services.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>The future of the NHS</h3>
      <p>And Mr Corbyn said the NHS needed more funding as he told the audience about a “friend of mine” who died on Monday morning from secondary breast cancer.</p>
      <p>However, he was unable to answer Mr Johnson’s claim that Labour’s plan for a four-day week would “add massively to the burdens not just of the NHS but of every public service in the country”, saying only that it would be paid for by “productivity increases”.</p>
      <p>The Tory Party was accused of misleading people when the Conservative Party press office changed its name on Twitter to “factcheckUK” as the debate began, in an apparent attempt to present itself as an independent fact checking service.</p>
      <p>Fact-checking organisation Full Fact tweeted: “It is inappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their twitter account ‘factcheckUK’ during this debate.”</p>
