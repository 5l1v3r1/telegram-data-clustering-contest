      <p>If you tweet to Ellen DeGeneres, you never know what might happen.</p>
      <p>That’s what Kate Austin discovered when she took to Twitter and tagged DeGeneres and Chrissy Teigen as she shared photos of her and fiancee Sarah Sulsenti as the question was being popped, with the Eiffel Tower as a backdrop,</p>
      <p>“hi @chrissyteigen &amp; @TheEllenShow!! my parents aren’t going to attend my wedding because they don’t like that i’m gay! i need someone to walk me down the aisle and someone else for a ‘father/daughter’ dance. plz come, my fiancée and i would cry 💕 #shootingmyshot,” Austin wrote.</p>

      <p>During Tuesday’s edition of her daytime talk show’s “Show Me Your Tweets” segment, DeGeneres brought the couple onstage as her guests for a brief interview. Chatting with DeGeneres, Austin admitted that since she came out as gay five years ago it’s strained her relationship with her mother.</p>
      <p>“My mom was really terrible,” Austin told DeGeneres. “She said everything you could think of under the sun.”</p>

      <p>While DeGeneres informed the couple she wouldn’t be able to make it to the wedding, she offered the next best thing: a life-sized cardboard cut-out with a retractable arm to hold tissues.</p>
      <p>But then DeGeneres revealed the <i>real </i>surprise as the couple’s friends and family members suddenly appeared onstage, with Sulsenti getting down on own knee to recreate the Parisian proposal.</p>
      <p>Tearfully calling DeGeneres her “biggest role model,” Sulsenti added, “If it wasn’t for someone like you, I would have never had the courage to just go out there in the public and propose to my fiancee. So many people don’t accept that. You paved the way for queer women everywhere.”</p>
      <p>“Everybody deserves love,” Ellen replied. “That’s the most important thing. That is all that matters in this life.”</p>
