      <h1>'Mini fist pump' - Player ratings as strong defensive display earns Bristol Rovers FA Cup win over Bromley</h1>
      <h2>How we rated the players in the 1-0 FA Cup replay win</h2>

      <p>
        <b>Jordi van Stappershoef - 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pulled off one good save in the first half to deny Luke Coulson's curled shot and looked calm whenever called upon. Claimed a number of lofted balls into the box and was also smart enough to slow the game down when taking goal kicks and with the ball in hand, frustrating the hosts and allowing Rovers the chance to regroup when under pressure.</p>
      <p><b>Mark Little -</b> <b>6</b></p>
      <p>Looked like a threat early on as he found a lot of space down the right wing, but he was slowly pinned back by Bromley attacking down the wings. Looked solid enough up against the skillful threat of Luke Coulson, but did not have a standout game before being replaced just before the hour mark.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alfie Kilgour - 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Headed a number of high balls clear and cleared plenty of balls into the box, including a dangerous one that looked like it would squeeze its way past van Stappershoef late in the first half. Looked a little nervy with the ball at his feet, air-kicking a clearance, but overall this was a strong performance.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tony Craig - 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dominant throughout, winning a number of aerial battles and clearing everything that came his way. It was an assured performance against a side that consistently looked to put crosses into the box. His mini fist pump after blocking a shot from the edge of the area early on in the second half typified his full-blooded display.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rollin Menayese - 7</b>
      </p>

      <p>A solid performance. He coped well with a number of lofted balls, and showed some good pace to deal with Bromley attacking down the wings. He also pushed forward well a times, looking good with the ball at his feet. Moved over to right-back for the final half an hour and coped well.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Luke Leahy - 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Quiet at left wing-back. He did not do anything too wrong, but struggled to prevent Reeco-Hackett Fairchild from swinging in crosses, with the winger's pace and trickery proving difficult to deal with.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ollie Clarke - 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Created the goal with a great break from midfield, intercepting a pass before bursting onto the wing and putting a fine ball into the box. He did well in the cut and thrust of midfield, winning a number of loose balls and consistently looked to put Rovers onto the front foot. Not everything he did came off, but he was one of the few Rovers players who looked to drive forward.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Abu Ogogo - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Played in the holding midfield role, which subdued his energy and his ability to push Rovers forward, but his physicality and ability to break play up and win aerial battles proved crucial in keeping the hosts at bay for long periods of the game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Liam Sercombe - 7</b>
      </p>

      <p>Did not get on the ball often enough but, when he did, he was a threat. Was one of the few Rovers players who looked to get the ball down and play, consistently keeping possession and finding teammates in good positions. Rovers were unable to get the ball to him often enough though.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tom Nichols - 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Looked fairly bright throughout, full of energy and quick to close down the Bromley defence to force them into mistakes, but his final ball was lacking too often to be a regular threat.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jonson Clarke-Harris - 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scored the goal that ultimately decided the contest, turning in Ollie Clarke#s cross from close range, and produced one moment of magic as he brought down a long ball before turning his man and firing a shot narrowly wide. Rovers did not get him into the game often enough for him to be a regular threat, but it was also good to see him get 90 minutes under his belt.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Subs</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Alex Rodman, for Little, 58 - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Did not get on the ball often enough to impact the game, with Rovers under pressure during his time on the pitch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Victor Adeboyejo, for Nichols, 70 - 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Struggled to get on the ball and gave it away too often when he did.</p>
