      <h1>Colin Kaepernick’s Lawyer Claims Two Teams Are Interested</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:52:52+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:52</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>It looks like things are coming together for Colin Kaepernick after the initial backlash regarding how his workout went down.</p>
      <p>Appearing on “<a href="https://adamcarolla.com/aj-benza-mark-geragos-and-nate-adams/">The Adam Carolla Show</a>” Tuesday, Mark Geragos, who is the lawyer for Colin Kaepernick, revealed that a couple of teams are actually showing interest in the free agent quarterback.</p>
      <p>Geragos said he thinks that something will happen on this “within the next 10 days.”</p>
      <blockquote>“There are two teams that I think are in the hunt. One who is legitimately in need of a quarterback who had a very poor showing on Sunday and has got an owner that I don’t think gives a s***.”</blockquote>
      <p>One of the teams might be the Carolina Panthers, because Kyle Allen is coming off a terrible performance where he threw four interceptions in an ugly loss to the Atlanta Falcons. However, Panthers owner David Tepper stated on Monday that the team isn’t interested in signing a veteran QB, and that includes Kaepernick.</p>
      <p>Another team might be the Pittsburgh Steelers, as much of the focus has been on the helmet fight incident, QB Mason Rudolph had a terrible outing on Sunday against the Cleveland Browns.</p>
      <p>Any team willing to sign Kaepernick has to know it will come with a tremendous amount of coverage and distraction, but if they feel he can help the team, then it may be worth it.</p>
