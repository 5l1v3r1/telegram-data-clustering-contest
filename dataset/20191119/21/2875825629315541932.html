      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Former world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury has written candidly of his marriage, battles with depression and being a young dad in his new book 'Behind the Mask'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:58:44+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:58</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Tyson and Paris Fury’s marriage is as strong as the former world ­heavyweight champion himself.</p>
      <p>The pair met when they were just 15 and 16, married aged 19 and 20, and 11 years later they have survived a long list of challenges.</p>
      <p>There has been heartache over Paris’s miscarriages and a child stillborn at six months. More pain came with Tyson’s descent into depression, drink and drug ­problems, his infidelity and his near attempt at suicide.</p>
      <p>And then there are the pressures of having five children – aged 10, eight and three under three. But they’ve stuck together and the boxer has his own theories about why.</p>
      <p>“It’s not been an easy road,” he explains, looking sharp in a tailor-made waistcoat. “Life and being with someone for a long time isn’t always easy.</p>
      <p>"But Paris understands me and I understand her and what I think is this – all men are the same. We’re all a***holes anyway so you’re better off with the devil you know than the one you don’t.</p>

      <p>“You’re never going to get your perfect man or woman unless they’re a Stepford husband or wife. If we focus on people’s flaws then we’re never going to be happy with each other.</p>
      <p>“Everyone has good and bad points, everyone argues and gets upset for nothing some days, but the good times outweigh the bad so we crack on with it. It’s called marriage.”</p>
      <p>He lightens up for a moment. “Look at the hair – she’s done that to me! I had a flowing head of hair when we met! It hasn’t all been me being a naughty boy. There’s been a lot of stress and responsibility getting married so young and having kids straight away, now with five.</p>

      <p>“I have a lot of people depending on me, so it’s a lot of pressure.”</p>
      <p>Pressure has affected Tyson, 31, in many ways over the past 10 years. The 6ft 9in self-proclaimed Gypsy King – the nickname refers to his traveller roots – has been honest in his autobiography Behind The Mask about what beating Wladimir Klitschko to become the WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO heavyweight champion of the world in 2015 did to him.</p>
      <p>He confesses that in the following 12 months he spiralled into a deep depression that made him see demons and hear voices, go on drink and drug binges for days, say things he now regrets, and balloon from 18 to 28 stone.</p>
      <p>It culminated in him nearly driving off a bridge in Manchester in July 2016 in his new Ferrari because he believed there was no point to his existence. Thinking of his kids saved his life.</p>
      <p>As he reveals in his book, his wife Paris, 30, was unaware of exactly what he was going through. She had packed the children in the car numerous times, ready to leave him for good.</p>

      <p>Yet while the rest of world wrote him off from returning to boxing – he was stripped of his IBF title and relinquished his remaining belts– Paris always decided to stay. And the two are closer than ever.</p>
      <p>The ITV fly-on-the-wall documentary At Home With The Furys, a four-parter airing early next year that follows Tyson and his family at home in Morecambe, Lancs, as he prepares for two fights, reveals how romantic they are.</p>
      <p>“Oh yeah, our special box,” he grins. “That’s a collection of bits and pieces that we’ve done in our life. I try to be as romantic as I can.”</p>
      <p>Although his career being busier than ever leaves little time for romance.</p>
      <p>“Not when you have five kids!” he laughs. “It’s hard for adults to have adult time. We used to go for date nights on ­Thursdays but now we have to organise babysitters and I have work.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been trying to watch The Joker at the movies for about a month.”</p>

      <p>It was <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> in 2017 when Tyson sought psychiatric help, and that, combined with his faith, helped him get clean, lose weight and go on to reclaim his success in the ring.</p>
      <p>He hopes that his story will inspire hope in others. “I’ve suffered the same problems as everyone else. People need to talk about it more and I want people to know there’s always someone you can talk to – go and get medical help. Suicide is a silent killer, there are so many people suffering.”</p>
      <p>He believes sport is vital to help those struggling. “Sports are essential for children. It gives them a drive and a focus into something positive instead of running around wild around the streets. As humans we need to let our energy go.</p>

      <p>“I got back into training and got fit again. I set myself short-term goals and I’ve learnt to manage and maintain my problems by going to the gym twice a day and giving myself a routine. It keeps me healthy and happy... If I don’t, I get a bit depressed.”</p>
      <p>The boxer believes he has enough experience now to stop depression from taking over again, and he is confident he knows what to do to get better if it did get to that stage.</p>
      <p>“Now I’ve got a grip on the mental health thing I don’t get the urges to go out for a week any more,” he says. “One night out is sufficient for anybody and then back to the gym the next day.”</p>
      <p>Now, in what might seem an unlikely alliance, Tyson is releasing a Christmas single this week with Robbie Williams. Bad Sharon is forecast to beat Lewis Capaldi and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> to number one.</p>

      <p>Tyson is known for singing in the ring after fights, and fan Robbie suggested they joined forces after watching him compete in Las Vegas earlier this year.</p>
      <p>“I feel like we have a lot in common,” Tyson says. “We both reached elevated positions and we both came crashing down with problems of our own, then both came back and are doing well in our preferred jobs. We’re both British, too, and like singing! It was a massive opportunity and a pleasure to work with him.”</p>
      <p>It has certainly been a packed year.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had two massive fights in Las Vegas this year, I’ve had a wrestling match in Saudi Arabia with WWE, my autobiography, the ITV documentary and then the Christmas single,” he says.</p>

      <p>“It’s been the busiest year of my life. And what a difference a year can make. I started training and coming back in 2018 and by the end of 2019 it’s total <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> takeover! It’s all good life experiences – you’re only young once. I’m enjoying it as it comes.” Tyson’s next fight is his rematch with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> in February. But there will not be many more. He says he’ll quit next year.</p>
      <p>“Three more fights and I’m done,” he says. “I’ll see my contract out and then 2020 I’m out of here. It’ll be 12 years then as a professional and 33 fights. I think that’s enough for anybody. I’ve done everything there is to do in boxing; I’ve won every single award.</p>
      <p>“I just hope to stay happy and in a mentally well place. That’s my ambition.</p>
      <p>“And I want to help young fighters, which I already do. I’ve got my manager’s licence now, so when I’ve finished these next three fights I’ll go in to managing, open a boxing club for young amateur boxers, and try to give local lads the opportunities I’ve had in my career.</p>
      <p>“I want people to see the real me. To be down and back up, and down and back up, to come from suicide and back to an elevated position in your sporting career. It’s a fairy tale story.”</p>
