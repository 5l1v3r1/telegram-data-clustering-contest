      <h1>Rob Gronkowski teases big announcement, but let's fans down after delivering it</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:41:50+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/tsd-staff/" target="_blank">TSD Staff</a></address>
      <p>Former Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski made the public believe he had an NFL-centric news nugget to drop on Tuesday, however, they were disappointed to hear his “big update” was anything but.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend, Gronk took to social media and announced that he had a “big announcement” to make, and given that the clock is ticking on him potentially signing with an NFL team, with just a few weeks remaining, fans thought he might be making his triumphant return to the football field. The Patriots, after all, are devoid of a consistent weapon in the passing game — aside from Julian Edelman — and their tight end corps is as weak as its ever been under head coach Bill Belichick.</p>
      <p>But fans who were hoping the news had anything to do with the NFL were quite disappointed, as all Gronkowski had to announce was that he’s hosting a musical festival called “Gronk Beach.”</p>

      <p>Welp, that’s not the news we were looking for. It sure looks like Gronk used his NFL platform to make a frivolous announcement that had absolutely nothing to do with football. Great PR move, or something.</p>
