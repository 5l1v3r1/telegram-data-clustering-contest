      <p>SCORES of Boko Haram fighters who ambushed troops in Dikwa council area of Borno State have been neutralised, the Army said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A carefully planned ambush complete with improvised explosive devises or IEDs was busted at New Marte by troops of 153 Task Force Battalion in Dikwa council.</p>
      <p>Gun trucks, anti-aircraft guns, 2,080 rounds of 7.62mm NATO ammunition, 26 rounds of 12.7mm armour piercing incendiary ammunition, AK 47 rifles, a motorcycle, clothes, foodstuff and sundry other items were reportedly recovered from the location as surviving insurgents fled.</p>
      <p>Less than two weeks ago, a number of the terrorists were killed by landmines they planted for troops.</p>
      <p>According to a statement signed by Nigerian Army Operations Media Coordinator, Colonel Aminu Iliyasu,  “it will be recalled that, less than two weeks ago, it was reported that Boko Haram criminal elements suffered a tactical boomerang when a sizeable number of them were neutralised and many others maimed as they mistakenly stepped on the same improvised explosive device that they had earlier planted against own troops.</p>

      <p>“In yet another incident of tactical boomerang in the face of superior tactics and training, in the early hours of 18th  November 2019, troops of 153 Task Force Battalion deployed at New Marte embarked on fighting patrol to Dikwa in Dikwa LGA of Borno State to hunt and destroy remnant  of  Boko Haram criminals in the general area. Incidentally, the troops encountered an ambush staged against them by some remnants  of the criminal Boko Haram insurgents along the patrol route at Ala Village, 7 km away from New Marte. The ambush was reinforced with a crudely prepared Improvised Explosive Device planted by them against the troops”.</p>
      <p>It continued that, “in a rare display of boldness,  resilience and faithful service to their fatherland, the troops, rather than getting  discouraged by this sudden attack on them, turned around the initial setback and dealt a devastating blow on their criminal attackers.</p>
      <p>“Having so clearly asserted their superiority in the ensuing fire fight,  the criminal insurgents were forced to flee in disarray.”</p>
