      <h1>Traumatised Jacqueline Jossa has I'm A Celebrity fans in tears in horrific trial</h1>
      <h2>Former EastEnders star Jacqueline Jossa was visibly nervous as she attempted her I'm A Celebrity trial - but managed to get all her stars and finish in the fastest time</h2>

      <p>Shaking Jacqueline Jossa had tears in her eyes as she nervously awaited her first Bushtucker Trial - but what came next stunned I'm A Celebrity viewers.</p>
      <p>Concerned viewers predicted she would instantly quit and be the first to yell out the famous words: "I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!"</p>
      <p>All five of the Snake Rock campmates headed to the trial clearing - where Ant and Dec explained they would put their head into a clear Perspex helmet and their hands into a box.</p>
      <p>Viewers had been voting for which critters would join them - and nervous Jacqueline said: "I feel like this is too soon to cry but I'm going to cry."</p>
      <p>Jacqueline had tears in her eyes as she anxiously watched all of her campmates face their fears.</p>

      <p>Finally it was time for Jacqueline to take her turn and she was shaking as she approached the boxes.</p>
      <p>It was the worst possible choice as the ex-EastEnders' biggest fear is spiders - and Caitlyn Jenner warned nothing would hurt her.</p>
      <p>She closed her eyes and took deep breathes as the rangers dumped the spiders into her helmet and hand box.</p>
      <p>But to everyone's surprise, brave Jacqueline nimbly unscrewed first one star, and then a second in double quick time.</p>

      <p>The victorious campmate received hugs as she triumphantly returned to her seat and burst into tears.</p>
      <p>Not only did Jacqueline complete the task, but she managed to beat everyone else and did it in the quickest time.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline's two stars meant that the celebrities won a total of seven stars, therefore seven meals for camp.</p>

      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to praise Jacqueline, one fan said: "Hats off to Jacqueline Jossa there. Think half the country just wanted to give the traumatised lass a hug."</p>
      <p>"Why am I crying at I’m a celeb???? Watching Jacqueline smash that challenge and I’m crying like a baba," added another.</p>
      <p>A third said: "I’m so proud of jacqueline for getting both the stars and facing her fears"</p>
      <p>"Wow. Jacqueline was amazing. Love her even more than I did before! I couldn't have done that!," said a fourth.</p>

      <p>Most of her fellow campmates struggled to unscrew the stars while trying to deal with the critters.</p>
      <p>James struggled to release his second star while rats scrambled around the box - and Dec joked: "It's tough for us big guys."</p>
      <p>Comedian Andrew made some bizarre groaning noises as cockroaches were poured in and also managed one star.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn had jungle pythons in with her - and after some struggle managed to get the second star free.</p>
      <p>"And I have to say is Bush Tucker Trials are Olympics, that was gold medal standard," said Ant.</p>
      <p>Ian was scared of the scorpions but managed to get one star as well as the other boys.</p>
