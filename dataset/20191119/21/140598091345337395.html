      <h1>Aaron Ramsey-inspired Wales secure Euro 2020 qualification with victory over Hungary</h1>

      <p>After waiting nearly six decades for a place at an international tournament, Wales will now be attending their second in four years. That fact alone says plenty about the quality of this current generation of Welsh players and also of the excitement that will sweep through this nation in the months to follow.</p>
      <p>What has changed to allow Wales to enter this new era, where a spot at a major international event is now seen as a base-level target rather than a hopeful aspiration? A large part of the answer could be found in their first goal here, when one world class player combined with another to set Wales on course for Euro 2020 and all the dreams that come with it.</p>
      <p>Gareth Bale provided, Aaron Ramsey delivered. The two best players in Wales red have a strong support act, which is seemingly growing stronger by the month, but once again Ramsey and Bale showed it is they who determine their country’s fate on these sorts of occasions.</p>
      <p>Ramsey’s all-round brilliance, as much as his brace, will only add to Welsh expectations next summer. He has been absent for almost the entire qualifying campaign, when Wales have largely veered between decent and disappointing, but on his return he was a level above both his team-mates and his Hungarian opponents.</p>
      <p>“It’s about time he contributed,” laughed a delirious Bale. As the Cardiff City Stadium rocked in celebration, he was front and centre of it all. At one point he even danced behind a fan-made flag reading “Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order” — a moment which will no doubt prompt feverish outrage back in Spain. But on a night like this, who cares? Bale certainly didn’t. It is clear where his heart lies and that is in Cardiff, not Madrid.</p>

      <p>Such was the joy of it all that even the notoriously placid Ryan Giggs was getting carried away by emotions after Ramsey struck his second shortly after half-time. It is to the Wales manager’s credit that he has rebuilt his side’s momentum in this qualifying campaign, changing the system and gradually improving the team.</p>
      <p>Wales have been building momentum in recent games and this night of relief and exhilaration was without doubt the highest point in the career of Giggs the manager. “It is one of the greatest nights of my life,” he said. “I achieved a lot as a player but it is different as a manager with the pressure you are under. I was never nervous as a player but as a manager you are.”</p>
      <p>Those nerves will return in the summer but until then Giggs can plot how he will make the most out of the considerable attacking talent at his disposal. “We will enjoy it tonight and then I will start looking at ways the team can improve, because we have to,” he said.</p>
      <p>As it was in 2016, the sense is that Wales will have a chance if their defence can provide a platform for the likes of Bale and Ramsey to shine. Ramsey, in particular, issued an emphatic reminder of his ability here, contributing in all areas of the pitch and taking the game to Hungary at the sort of relentless pace which the visitors simply could not handle.</p>
      <p>“Have you seen why Ramsey is playing for Juventus, and previously playing for Arsenal? You can see how it is totally different, this way of playing,” said Hungary manager Marco Rossi, who spoke like a man who knew his time was up after their failure to qualify from this cagey group.</p>
      <p>Ramsey’s opener, that guided header from Bale’s right-wing cross, was the least Wales deserved for a start of technical quality and physical vigour. He smashed home the second from close range, moments after half-time, when Kieffer Moore’s hooked volley deflected into his path. Before then, Wayne Hennessey had expertly kept out Hungary’s one good goalscoring opportunity.</p>
      <p>There were other chances, too, with Bale, Daniel James and Ramsey all going close to making it three before the final whistle triggered joyous celebrations on the pitch. “It means everything,” said Ramsey. “We inspired a nation last time out [in France at Euro 2016]. We want to do it again.”</p>
