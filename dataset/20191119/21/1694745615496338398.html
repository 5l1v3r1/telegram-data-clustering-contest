      <p>No matter what <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/san-luis-retreat-hotel-in-italy-46786403">hotel you're stay at</a> while traveling, there tends to be one universal problem: the curtains never close completely, leaving a tiny sliver for the bright sun to shine right in way too early in the morning. And if you're <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/best-places-to-travel-in-2020-46785204">on vacation</a>, you want to be able to sleep in peace, right? Thankfully, there's a hack for that, and it involves one or two trusty hotel hangers with clips.</p>
      <p>Twitter user Rick Klau (@rklau) recently shared on Twitter that he randomly saw this hack on the social media site a while ago and has been doing it ever since with success. All you have to do is take that hanger or hangers right out of the closet and clip your two curtains together (you can put one at the top the curtain and one at the bottom for full coverage). Yes, you'll have a hanger dangling from the curtains for the rest of the night, but at least the sunlight in the morning won't seep into your room until you're ready for it.</p>
      <p>If you're <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/ecocamp-patagonia-domes-46824868">going to a hotel</a> that you know doesn't have hangers for some reason, bring some binder clips, which can also do the job and are small enough to pack in a carry-on. Now, go forth and sleep in complete darkness!</p>
