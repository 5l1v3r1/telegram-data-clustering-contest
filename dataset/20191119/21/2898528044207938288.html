      <h1>Ariane Lipski rips late-notice opponent Isabela de Padua for ‘swindling’ the UFC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Guilherme Cruz, https://facebook.com/guicruzmma/</a></address>
      <p>SAO PAULO — <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4605/ariane-lipski">Ariane Lipski</a> is not happy with her <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1055/ufc-fight-night-sao-paulo">UFC Sao Paulo</a> opponent <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5222/isabela-de-padua">Isabela de Padua</a>.</p>
      <p>The former KSW flyweight champion had a full camp for <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4327/priscila-cachoeira">Priscila Cachoeira</a>, but <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3803/veronica-macedo">Veronica Macedo</a> <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/6/20952536/veronica-macedo-steps-in-to-fight-ariane-lipski-at-ufc-sao-paulo">stepped in on 10 days’ notice</a> to save the fight after “Pedrita” <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/6/20952102/priscila-cachoeira-out-ufc-sao-paulo-failed-drug-test-diuretic-usada-mma">failed a drug test</a>. Then the night before official weigh-ins, Isabela de Padua was <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/15/20966254/ariane-lipski-ufc-sao-paulo-veronica-macedo-out-isabella-padua">signed by the promotion</a> to replace Macedo, who was suffering from severe headaches.</p>
      <p>“I was on weight on Thursday night and didn’t know if I would have a fight or not because Veronica had concussion-like symptoms,” Lipski told the media after the decision victory, her first win under the UFC banner. “They gave me a few names, but I didn’t know any of them.”</p>
      <p>De Padua was selected by the UFC to compete 48 hours later, but missed weight by 4.5 pounds on Friday morning. According to Lipski, the UFC gave her two options: decline the fight and get paid her purse, or take 30 percent of de Padua’s money and compete.</p>
      <p>“After the weigh-ins, I thought (about not taking the fight) because she was 4.5 pounds heavier,” Lipski said. “What I was waiting for was if the UFC would give me a fight in December. If they did I wouldn’t fight (in Sao Paulo), but since there was no fight in December I said I would fight right now.</p>
      <p>“Isabela lied about her weight. She said she would make weight and took the spot from another athlete that was willing to make weight.”</p>
      <p>For Lipski, de Padua was just “swindling” her and the UFC to get the opportunity and have an advantage on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>“Unprofessional,” Lipski said. “The first obligation of a fighter is to make weight. She tried to get an advantage to win the fight, saying she would make weight but then be heavier and have an advantage.</p>
      <p>“That did not piss me off, but wasn’t the right thing. She doesn’t have my respect… It pissed me off a little bit, but I was focused from start to finish.”</p>
