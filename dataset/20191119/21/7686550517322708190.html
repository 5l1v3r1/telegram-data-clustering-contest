      <p>Welsh TV presenter Sian Lloyd has apologised after comparing <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea">Swansea</a> traffic to a holocaust.</p>
      <p>The former ITV weather presenter posted the tweet on Monday afternoon after travelling from a hotel near the city centre to the Mumbles area.</p>
      <p>Having been held up in for more than an hour, she referred to her journey as “yet another traffic holocaust”.</p>
      <p>She also referred to her journey as “the worst ever” and criticised traffic management in Swansea.</p>
      <p>Her tweet read: “Yet another traffic holocaust in Swansea today. Probs the worst ever. Over 1 HOUR to get to the Village Hotel from Mumbles. Took sis 1 hr 40 mins to Neath earlier. Everything is wrong about traffic management in Swansea.”</p>
      <p>She received criticism online and moved to clarify her comments to her 73,000 Twitter followers.</p>
      <p>The word ‘holocaust’ is defined as “destruction or slaughter on a mass scale, especially caused by fire or nuclear war”.</p>
      <p>However, the word ‘Holocaust’ - with a capital h -in an historical context refers to the death of millions of Jewish people in concentration camps across Europe during the Second World War.</p>

      <p>Following criticism, she apologised for any offence caused and said she was “half Jewish”.</p>
      <p>She said: “I wrote and meant the noun with a small h, a bona fide word, an not the awful historical noun with a big H. A big mistake to have used that noun. So sorry to have offended folk.”</p>
      <p>Ms Lloyd has since deleted the tweet.</p>
      <p>Wales Online has approached her for a comment.</p>
