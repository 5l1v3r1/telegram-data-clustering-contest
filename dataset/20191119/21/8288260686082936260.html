      <p> Fans were left astonished after they watched two teams play out the "world's dullest ever rugby match" which incredibly finished NIL-NIL.</p>
      <p>Pinley RFC and Spartans RFC defied odds of 1,000/1 after they missed six penalties and failed to score a single try between them during the 80 minute game.</p>
      <p>The two amateur teams could not break the deadlock as they battled it out in the Midlands Two West South League at Wyken Croft in Coventry on Saturday (16/11).</p>
      <p>Supporters looked on in amazement as both sides repeatedly cancelled each other out before the encounter amazingly finished 0-0.</p>

      <p>No game of professional rugby union has ever finished scoreless and the last time it happened at the top level was between Scotland and New Zealand in 1964.</p>
      <p>Pinley RFC president Gary Marks insisted the game was still entertaining despite opposition supporters in the 200 strong crowd branding it "the dullest game ever."</p>

      <p>He said: “I’ve been there for 40 years and I’ve never seen a nil-nil.</p>
      <p>“It was entertaining, but defences won the day. Both sides are known for having a strong set of forwards. It was a bruising encounter.</p>
      <p>“If there’d been another half an hour neither team would’ve scored. It was one of those days.</p>
      <p>“Spartans missed five kicks, including one to win the game which hit the woodwork.</p>

      <p>“In the first half the Pinley fly-half Harry Marks, my son, missed one from in front of the posts. I think there was a couple of try-scoring chances butchered by both sides.</p>
      <p>“Pinley had a try disallowed because the referee deemed there to be a knock-on. In a separate incident a Pinley player dropped the ball over the line.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Pinley captain Sam Nicholls, 28, added: “I’ve never played in a nil nil game before and I can only remember playing in one other draw in 11 years.</p>
      <p>“It was a decent game, there wasn’t lots of boring pick and go.</p>
      <p>“In the first half we must’ve had 20 to 25 minutes of possession in their half but they kept us out.</p>

      <p>“We missed a kick from in front of the posts and could’ve scored two tries. In the second half it evened out and their lad missed five kicks.</p>
      <p>“One bounced off the post at the end then we ran it and knocked it on.</p>
      <p>“Both teams defended really well. We’re known for our defence and often hold teams, especially at home.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think this will happen again next game. Hopefully we’ll score a lot more points - if we get a new kicker.”</p>
      <p>But fans of Spartans, based in Sutton Coldfield, West Mids., who travelled to the game said they were left "bored stiff" watching the nil-nil unfold.</p>
      <p>Supporter Steven Bridgman, 49, said: "I'm not sure how you can call a nil-nil game of rugby entertaining - I was bored stiff watching it in the cold waiting for something to happen."</p>
      <p>Nick Say, 68, added: "It has to be be the dullest ever games of rugby I've seen. I've never known anything like it.</p>

      <p>"You get them in football all the time - but I've been watching rugby for over 50 years and I've never heard of this happening before."</p>
      <p>The Rugby Football Union (RFU), the governing body for the sport, said they do not hold records for amateur games that have finished nil-nil.</p>
      <p>But bookmakers Ladbrokes revealed the odds of it happening are around 1,000/1.</p>

      <p>Alex Apati, of Ladbrokes, said: "Plenty of eyebrows have been raised on our trading floor at this one.</p>
      <p>"It's not exactly something we see every day. We're looking forward to seeing how the reverse fixture pans out with Pinley and Spartans already pulling off a 1000/1 result."</p>
