      <h1>Daniel Levy ready to explore Jose Mourinho option as he seeks next Tottenham boss</h1>
      <h2>Mauricio Pochettino has been dismissed by Tottenham and Jose Mourinho is interested in replacing him as the club's next manager</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Lewis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho wants to become the new Spurs boss after Mauricio Pochettino was sensationally sacked on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The ex-Manchester United boss - now a free agent - is open to talks after the north Londoners sent shock waves throughout Europe by cutting the man that led them to last season’s Champions League loose.</p>
      <p>Contact has not yet been made but Levy is expected to explore the option as he faces paying up £12.5million-a-year Pochettino and his staff.</p>
      <p>Levy blamed the club’s poor run of form either side of the summer for the decision.</p>
      <p>Despite reaching the knockout stages of the Champions League, Spurs sit 14th in the Premier League having won just three times this season.</p>

      <p>Levy said: “Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and the beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>
      <p>“It falls on the board to make the difficult decisions - this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff - but we do so in the club's best interests.”</p>
      <p>Pochettino and his staff - assistant Jesus Perez, and coaches Miguel d'Agostino and Antoni Jimenez - have also left the club. They all had three and a half years left on their contracts.</p>
      <p>Pochettino guided <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> to the League Cup final in his first full season while two third-placed finishes sandwiched a runners-up spot in the Premier League in 2017.</p>

      <p>As well as leading Spurs to a runners-up finish in last season's Champions League he also took them to fourth in the league.</p>
      <p>He also had to contend with playing home games at Wembley for 18 months while the club's new ground was built and his impressive results despite this led to links with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>But as well as their disappointing league form, they were knocked out of the League Cup by League Two side Colchester and hammered 7-2 by Bayern Munich in the Champions League.</p>

      <p>"Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history," added Levy.</p>
      <p>"I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us.</p>
      <p>"I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here.</p>
      <p>"We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters."</p>
