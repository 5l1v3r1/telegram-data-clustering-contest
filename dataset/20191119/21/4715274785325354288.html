      <p>“May isang panahon na kinikilala ang mga taga-Maguindanao tulad nina Asian Games medalist Tukal Mukalam  at Mona Sulaiman sa pabilisan sa takbuhan. Pero matagal na nawala pati na rin sa mga kabataan dahil sa kailangan nilang tumakbo, hindi para sa kompetisyon kundi para sa kanilang mga buhay,” said BARMM-MBHTE Minister Hon. Monaguer A. Iqbal-Al-Haj.</p>
      <p> “Nagpapasalamat kami sa PSC-PSC at AFP sa pagbibigay ng bagong direksiyon sa buhay ng ating mga kabataan na hindi na sila tatakbo para iligtas ang kanilang buhay, kundi ang pag-asa na mabigyan at matikam naman nila ang isang magandang buhay,” said BSC-BARMM Chairman Norhan Malaguiok Uka.</p>

      <p>“We want to accomplished three objectives here in aiming to encourage our kids into sports and educate them,  then get them away from the call of the conflict here in Mindanao, and see them as being considered as young promising athletes that could be recruited by good schools and become national players,” said Ampatuan.</p>
