      <p>Each zodiac number is unique, and so is the individual associated with it. Numerology is a way to understand the personality and characteristics of people belonging to each number. The movements of their ruling planet influence an individual's behaviour. Your path number is probably the most influential numerological aspect to consider in life.</p>

      <h3>Number 2 – What to expect today?</h3>
      <p>Life is all about giving and receiving. It is about feeling each emotion and enjoying every moment. Often times, we tend to hide our feelings and think that we can change how we feel, but how we feel about certain things is not something that we can control or change. Emotions are felt because they have the power to affect other things around us, making things better or worse. So it is important that even you allow love to flow into your life. Your natural instinct is to keep giving others everything, but it is time that you start expecting things back and show that you have expectations in order to accept it.</p>

      <h3>Find your number</h3>
      <p>The ruling number of a person is based on their birth date. The addition of the digits of your birth date will be your ruling number. For example, if your birthday is on October 17, your ruling number will be 1 + 7 = 8. If your birthday falls on January 29, your lucky number will be 2 + 9 = 11. You need to further add this number to get a single digit. So it will be 1 + 1 = 2. A person with a single-digit birth date like February 5 will have their ruling number as 5.</p>
