      <p>Pop star Ed Sheeran has been given approval to build a prayer retreat on his country estate.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old singer has already bought a number of properties close to Framlingham in Suffolk where he grew up.</p>
      <p>A planning application for the construction of an outbuilding near Wynneys Hall was granted by East Suffolk Council on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The plans say the structure would “address an important need for a private place of retreat for contemplation and prayer, for celebration of key life and family milestones, family and social gatherings, marriages, christenings and so forth”.</p>

      <p>“It would also allow the applicant’s family, friends and colleagues to be able enjoy these things and join them in their observance,” it adds.</p>
      <p>Sheeran lives on the estate with his wife Cherry Seaborn, a childhood friend who he attended school with in Suffolk.</p>
      <p>The new building is described in the application as “novel and modern”, but designed not to conflict with the parish church of St Mary.</p>
      <p>“The applicant has as his guests and visiting colleagues at Wynneys Hall people from around the world,” the application says.</p>
      <p>“Many of these people are from many countries, faiths and customs, including for example the USA, Ireland, Ghana, Nigeria, Asia and Australia.</p>
      <p>“Thus, the applicant seeks to provide a space in which he, his family and these different people can retreat for contemplation, prayer and relaxation, to meet, celebrate and meditate in peace and safety from disturbance when they visit Dennington.”</p>
