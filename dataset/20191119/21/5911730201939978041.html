      <p>A couple who does photography is <a href="https://www.wmar2news.com/news/national/shelter-dogs-featured-in-professional-photographs-of-dancers">doing their part to help shelter animals find new homes.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.prattkreidich.com/">Kelly Pratt Kreidich and Ian Kreidich</a> took photos of dancers from the Saint Louis Ballet company posing with dogs and cats from the <a href="https://www.strayrescue.org/">Stray Rescue of St. Louis.</a></p>
      <p>The project is called "Muttcracker" because the dancers are wearing Nutcracker costumes.</p>
      <p>The goal is to get all of the animals shown adopted.</p>
      <p>The photographers did the same project last year and all of the animals photographed were adopted within two months.</p>
      <p>A hardcover book of these photos is being released November 19.</p>
      <p>You can buy it <a href="https://dancersanddogs.com/">here.</a></p>
