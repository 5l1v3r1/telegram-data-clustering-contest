      <h1>Where is Euro 2020 being held?</h1>
      <h2>This time round the competition will be very different</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:49:44+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:49</time> by <a rel="author">Elliott Jackson</a></address>
      <p>Euro 2020 is one step closer with the group stage of qualification coming to an end on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Although there is the small matter of the Nations League play-offs to sort in March next year, fans will be busy planning their journeys to support their national sides.</p>
      <p>This time round the tournament has a very different format, so supporters should be aware of big changes from the last competition held in France in 2016.</p>
      <p>So, how will it all work? Here are all the key details you need to know.</p>
      <h3>Who is hosting EURO2020?</h3>
      <p>For the first time in the competition's history, the Euros will be held across 12 different cities, in 12 different countries across Europe.</p>
      <p>Of the 12 venues, all will stage at least three group stage games and a knock-out round tie each. The breakdown of each venue and games can be seen in the table below.</p>
      <p>Group stage &amp; Round of 16 - Denmark (Copenhagen) - Parken Stadium</p>
      <p>Group stage &amp; Round of 16 - Hungary (Budapest) - Ferenc Puskas Stadium</p>
      <p>Group stage &amp; Round of 16 - Ireland (Dublin) - Aviva Stadium</p>
      <p>Group stage &amp; Round of 16 Netherlands (Amsterdam) - Johann Cruijff Arena</p>
      <p>Group stage &amp; Round of 16 - Romania (Bucharest) - Arena National</p>
      <p>Group stage &amp; Round of 16 - Scotland (Glasgow) - Hampden Park</p>

      <p>Group stage &amp; Quarter-final - Italy (Rome) - Stadio Olimpico</p>
      <p>Group stage &amp; Quarter-final - Russia (Saint Petersburg) - Krestovsky Stadium</p>
      <p>
        <b>Group stage, Round of 16, Semi-finals &amp; Final - England (London) - Wembley Stadium</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Why is EURO2020 being held across 12 venues?</h3>
      <p>The decision to change the format of EURO2020 to include several cities, rather than one or two host capitals was decided by UEFA in 2012.</p>
      <p>The change is to honour the tournament's 60-year anniversary with FIFA President Gianni Infantino explaining that "instead of having a party in one country, we will have a party all over Europe in the summer of 2020."</p>
      <p>Whilst it's unclear if this is going to be a regular format, Gianni did imply this one would be a one-off change, although who knows what the future may hold.</p>
