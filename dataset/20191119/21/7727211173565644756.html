      <p>Southport DJ Adele Roberts fought with Roman Kemp tonight over her idol Jane McDonald.</p>
      <p>Last night Adele <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/cheryls-swipe-itv-im-celebrity-17278467">shocked the camp</a> as she revealed her luxury item was a photo of the cruise crooner.</p>
      <p>Jane McDonald herself tweeted about the incident last night and said: "Absolutely thrilled to see my picture <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/scarlett-moffatt-dropped-itvs-saturday-17278420">in the jungle.</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/AdeleRoberts">@AdeleRoberts</a> I flipping love you. Best of luck <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> "</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebritys-nadine-coyle-opens-17283071">tonight the camp</a> were still struggling to accept Adele's devotion to Jane.</p>

      <p>Kate said: "Jane McDonald is looking over us, can you think of a song of hers?”</p>
      <p>Adele said: "I know her off Loose Women, I don’t know her actual songs but I know her from the cruising show when she does covers.”</p>
      <p>Myles and Roman laughed and said “No one knows what she does.” Kate said “She’s a legend.”  Roman said: "She’s a legend is she? Name a song?” Kate couldn’t think of one.</p>
      <p>Myles and Roman continued to laugh. </p>
      <p>Adele said: "She’ll cruise around the world, for example she’d go to Iceland and then sing a Bjork or would go to the USA and sing Proud Mary.”</p>

      <p>Roman said: “It’s just random mate.” Adele said: “Why though? I don’t understand.”</p>
      <p>Roman said: "How is it not random”</p>
      <p>Adele said: "But if I had brought in a picture of Ru-Paul would you have the same reaction?”</p>
      <p>Roman said he didn’t know. Kate said: “Well he’s heard of Ru-Paul.” Roman said: “I just find it random.”</p>
      <p>Adele said: "That’s prejudice, I’m allowed to like what I want.”</p>
      <p>Roman realised he’d wound up Adele so said: “I wasn’t saying that at all, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to.”</p>

      <p>Adele said: “It’s like you’re saying ‘why would I like Jane McDonald’”</p>
      <p>Roman said: “Adele it’s not, the situation is funny.”</p>
      <p>Adele said: “I’m not allowed to like what I want?” Kate said: “Of course you are.”</p>
      <p>Roman said sorry again and Adele said: “It’s fine, you are just going on about it so much…” Kate said: “It’s just fun around camp.”</p>
      <p>Roman said: “I like the picture being there.” and then hugged Adele.</p>
