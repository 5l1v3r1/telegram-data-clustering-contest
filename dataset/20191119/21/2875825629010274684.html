      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino pleaded for 'time to build' in final Tottenham press conference</h1>
      <h2>The Argentine appeared to accept he faced the possibility of being sacked after the draw with Sheffield United on November 9</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:35:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:35</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/mauricio-pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a> predicted that he would not be given the time to rebuild <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> in his final press conference as Spurs boss.</p>
      <p>Spurs’ horrible start to the season continued as they were again sub-standard in stuttering to a 1-1 draw against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/sheffield-united-fc">Sheffield United</a> before the international break, leaving them with just three wins from their opening 12 league games.</p>
      <p>Pochettino had previously spoken at length about how the club were entering a “painful rebuild” after their run to the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/champions-league">Champions League</a> final last term, but no one envisaged just how painful things would be on the pitch as well as off it.</p>
      <p>They led at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium through Son Heung-min, but George Baldock’s 78th-minute leveller earned the Blades, who also had a goal marginally ruled out by VAR, a deserved point.</p>

      <p>Pochettino said in the build up to the Blades clash that he would have liked to see out the remaining three years of his contract.</p>
      <p>But following what proved to be his last game in charge, he ultimately accepted that he was running out of time.</p>
      <p>“I think you can see that yes, we need to find the balance,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We are building a team during the season, while competing in the Champions League and Premier League, the toughest league in the world, and always that is dangerous, this type of situation can happen.</p>

      <p>“You expect better results than you get. Of course we are in a process to build and we’ll see if we have time to build what we want.”</p>
      <p>The relationship between Pochettino and chairman Daniel Levy had become fraught in recent months, with the pair having ceased speaking to each other.</p>
      <p>That in part led to the Argentine's departure as Spurs manager, with the 47-year-old being denied the chance to rebuild his squad.</p>
