      <p><b>Hong Kong</b><b>:</b> A British colonial-era emergency law revived by Hong Kong’s government to ban masks in the ongoing protests was on Monday ruled by the High Court to be excessive and unconstitutional. The court said that the law, which came into effect on October 5, goes against the Basic Law (the city’s constitution), Efe news reported citing public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong as saying. “We should also make it clear that it is not our judgment that (an) ‘anti mask’ law is generally objectionable or unconstitutional. Its validity must, however, depend on the details of the legislation and the particular societal aims sought to be pursued by the measure,” the court’s judges said. (IANS)</p>
