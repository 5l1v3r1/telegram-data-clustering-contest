      <h2>Favorite leaders and Christmas gifts in the UK election debate.</h2>

      <p>Boris Johnson doesn't have a favorite world leader but 27 of them!</p>
      <p>Asked in a televised election debate on Tuesday "which current foreign leader do you most admire?" the British prime minister said: "I would like the EU27, all of them, because they did me a fantastic deal which enables us to come out of the EU."</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn went for António Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations.</p>
      <p>The Conservative and Labour leaders were taking part in a<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/boris-johnson-and-jeremy-corbyn-clash-over-brexit-in-first-uk-election-tv-debate/"> debate broadcast on ITV</a> ahead of the U.K.'s public poll on December 12.</p>
      <p>The final question of the debate also featured Johnson's Brexit deal. Asked what gift each leader would get the other, Corbyn said a copy of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" so he could "understand how nasty Scrooge was."</p>
      <p>Despite being told to pick a non-political gift, Johnson said he would get Corbyn a copy of "my brilliant Brexit deal." Corbyn looked disgusted at the prospect.</p>
