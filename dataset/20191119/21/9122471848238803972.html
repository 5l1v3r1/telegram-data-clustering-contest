      <h1>LSU Safety Not Happy With Defense’s Performance vs. Ole Miss</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:11:12+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>LSU is a national championship contender – there’s no doubt about it. But there are legitimate concerns starting to emerge after the Tigers’ defense allowed 37 points to Ole Miss last Saturday.</p>
      <p>Safety JaCoby Stevens is displeased with how LSU’s defense performed against the Rebels. He spoke to the media on Monday to discuss the Tigers’ lackluster performance.</p>
      <blockquote>“I was embarrassed for LSU defense,” Stevens said, via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g5ptAf232Q">Tiger Details’ video</a>. “Defensively, we didn’t put out a great representation of how we practice and how we play.”</blockquote>
      <p>The LSU defense struggled to contain Ole Miss quarterback John Rhys Plumlee on Saturday. The dynamic freshman put on a show, rushing for 212 yards and three touchdowns while adding 123 yards through the air.</p>
      <blockquote>“I feel like we were getting dominated,” Stevens continue to say. “Ole Miss in the second half pretty much did whatever they wanted to do. That’s not how we’re supposed to play defense. That’s not how LSU defense is played.”</blockquote>
      <p>This isn’t the first time this season that LSU has allowed at least 30 points to opposing offenses. Texas, Vanderbilt, Alabama and now Ole Miss were each able to drop at least 37 on the Tigers.</p>
      <p>LSU is a probable College Football Playoff participant which means the Tigers will likely face Clemson, Ohio State or a Big 12/Pac-12 school. Each of the potential playoff teams have elite offenses.</p>
      <p>The Tigers will have to adjust on the defensive side of the ball to bring the championship trophy home to Baton Rouge.</p>
