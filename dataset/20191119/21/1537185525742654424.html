      <p>LUBBOCK, Texas (KCBD) - A grand jury has indicted a former Lubbock senior community employee on a charge of delivery of a dangerous drug after police say he tried to give a resident medication that he stole from another job.</p>
      <p>55-year-old Vicente Mojica, of Lubbock, was an employee of Legacy at South Plains, a concierge senior community on South Indiana Avenue.</p>
      <p>On Feb. 28, 2019, police were called to Legacy. An employee in training had informed their supervisor about concerns with Mojica and how he was conducting training.</p>
      <p>According to the report, the employee said as they were pulling medication for a resident, Mojica pulled a white pill from his pocket and placed it into the medication cup. He told the employee, “here, give this to her, I got if from my other job. It will help calm her down.”</p>
      <p>The report states the manager immediately removed the added medication before it was given to the resident, the drug was identified as being from a different manufacturer than the resident’s normal medication.</p>
      <p>The manager confronted Mojica and said he admitted to her in front of a witness that he took the medication from his other job and put it in the patient’s cup. Mojica told the manager, “I thought it would help calm her down.”</p>
      <p>Mojica was fired from his job and police were called.</p>
      <p>Further research showed this is not Mojica’s first brush with the law.</p>
      <p>in May of this year, he was indicted on a charge of sexual assault of an adult. That incident is reported to have happened on June 24, 2018.</p>
      <p>According to the police report in this case, he met a woman on Plenty of Fish. After talking a while, they decided to meet and go to the flea market. Afterwards, he took her to his house and gave her a tour, to see if she would be interested in renting a room from him. He took her to his bedroom and told her his bed was a “magic bed.” He told her he had 7 roommates and he had room for one more.</p>
      <p>Once in his room, he blocked the door and wouldn’t let her out, the report stated.</p>
      <p>The woman sat in a chair next to his bed after he told her to sit down. He then picked her up and threw her on the bed, according to the police report.</p>
      <p>The woman reports he sexually assaulted her after she reportedly told him no several times.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, Mojica drove her home and she reported the assault to police.</p>
      <p>This case is still active in the courts. Mojica is not currently in jail.</p>
