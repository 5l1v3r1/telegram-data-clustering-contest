      <h2>Second-half spree of goals as Albion set up second round tie against Oldham Athletic</h2>

      <p>It has taken six long years but Burton Albion finally came through an FA Cup round at the first hurdle last night when they beat Salford City 4-1 at the Pirelli Stadium.</p>
      <p>A goal from Lucas Akins, three minutes before half-time. set the Brewers on their way and after Salford equalised early in the second half, Albion raised the tempo and goals from David Templeton, John Brayford and Oliver Sarkic sent them into the second round., in which they will be away to Oldham Athletic.</p>
      <p>It was their first win in an FA Cup tie since 2013, when they beat Fleetwood Town in a replay. Fleetwood were, at the time, managed by Salford boss Graham Alexander.</p>

      <p>The Brewers were able to welcome back goalkeeper Kieran O'Hara from international duty, released by the Republic of Ireland after making his first start in winning his second cap last week. Among those beating niggles to start the game were Brayford, Jake Buxton, John-Joe O'Toole, Templeton and Sarkic.</p>
      <p>A purposeful run from left-back by Kieran Wallace got Burton going and Templeton won a corner on the left before Scott Fraser's shot was deflected wide for another within the first minute.</p>
      <p>O'Hara's value was evident the first time Salford got forward, in the third minute, as Oscar Threlkeld got a shot away from 15 yards and the keeper flew to his right to turn it away.</p>
      <p>Lucas Akins could not get over a cross from Templeton in the eighth minute, then Stephen Quinn, picking up the ball 25 yards out, sent a tame shot wide.</p>
      <p>The Brewers had certainly made the better start on what was another quiet night at the Pirelli, the lateness of the date announcement inevitably contributing to a low attendance, with both ends of the ground closed.</p>
      <p>A cutback from the right by Sarkic, sent through by Ryan Edwards, was just behind Akins in the 13th minute.</p>
      <p>Fraser, challenging for a ball on the edge of the box, was upended in the 18th minute to give the Brewers a free kick in a dangerous spot 20 yards out. O'Toole was the surprise taker and sent his effort a foot over.</p>
      <p>Salford won their first corner, on the right, in the 21st minute, but Buxton got a solid clearing header to it.</p>
      <p>A poor ball out of defence by Salford in the 23rd minute gave Burton a great chance as Sarkic pounced on it but when he played Akins through, his first touch was poor and, instead of shooting, he gave the ball to Templeton, who was crowded out.</p>
      <p>Albion came closest yet after 29 minutes when Sarkic was fouled on the right and Buxton met Edwards' free kick with a thumping header towards the top corner that Chris Neal turned away for a corner.</p>
      <p>Still the Brewers were having more of the play and Quinn had a shot blocked in the 32nd minute.</p>
      <p>His next action was to concede a free kick 35 yards out and, from it, the Brewers had a big escape.</p>
      <p>Ibou Touray's kick found Carl Piergianni unmarked six yards out but he completely mistimed his header and presented the ball gently to O'Hara. He really should have scored.</p>
      <p>Two more half chances followed for Burton, as Sarkic could not quite gather a long diagonal ball into the box from Quinn. then another through ball ran away from Akins. The big talisman had not had the best of nights up to then but, after 42 minutes, he came good.</p>
      <p>Sarkic, wide on the right, delivered a teasing cross, the sort manager Nigel Clough has been pleading with his forwards to get on the end of, and, this time, Akins did, squeezing it past Neal at the near post.</p>
      <p>It was a lead Burton deserved although, as in the first game, Salford had provided a fair few dangerous moments of their own.</p>
      <p>An early free kick for Salford after the break came to nothing but they equalised after 52 minutes.</p>
      <p>Burton were aggrieved not to get a free kick as Wallace went sprawling as he charged forward but Salford's counter led to a deep cross from the right by Armstrong and Touray arrived beyond the far post to bury a firm header.</p>
      <p>The Brewers' response was good, a sustained spell of attacking leading up to the hour, but it was only after this ended with a fracas in one corner, in which Brayford was booked for dissent, that they got back in front.</p>
      <p>Fraser brilliantly turned on the right and picked out Templeton on the left. The winger cut inside and hit a fierce shot across and beyond Neal.</p>
      <p>After 70 minutes, Albion made it 3-1. Fraser delivered a deep free kick from the left beyond the far post, where Brayford arrived with a strong downward header which Neal half-saved before Brayford claimed the final touch as several players scrambled for the rebound.</p>
      <p>Burton made their first change after 75 minutes, Templeton receiving a good ovation as he was replaced by Lloyd Dyer. Fraser, after a burst forward, stayed down and needed treatment after 78 minutes and eventually came off, to be replaced by Colin Daniel.</p>
      <p>A minute later, the tie looked safe, as Sarkic raced away down the right, cut back and, with options, chose instead to go it alone, smashing a shot across Neal into the corner.</p>
      <p>It was a fitting end to a committed and professional performance by the Brewers, their progress, eventually, thoroughly deserved.</p>
