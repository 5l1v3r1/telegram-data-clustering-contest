      <h1>The New Trailer For ‘Cats’ Is Just As Cursed As The Last One, So The Internet Is Going Wild</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:18:02+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:18</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p><i>Cats</i>, the stage musical, is not particularly cursed.</p>
      <p>At its heart, it’s a whimsical, wholesome imagining of what happens in feline-filled alleyways when the sun goes down. People in costumes come out, they each sing a song, and then at the end they all stand in a big group and belt out one final number. It’s about as inoffensive as sliced bread.</p>
      <p>But somehow, in the process of being translated to the screen, <i>Cats</i> has become deeply, deeply cursed.</p>
      <p>This was established the moment that the first trailer for the film version dropped. Filled with CGI-weirdos with disturbingly human faces and furry bodies, the trailer was a work of anti-art that <a href="https://junkee.com/cats-trailer-memes/214566">sent the internet into minor meltdown.</a></p>
      <p>Well, guess what, the new trailer is here, and it’s just as bizarre.</p>
      <p>If you love the sight of James Corden doing pratfalls while covered in digital fur, Idris Elba remaining unnervingly sexy even in cat form, and Taylor Swift staring lustily at the camera while topped with two pointy ginger ears, then you’re in luck.</p>
      <p>If all of that sounds weird, well, you’re not alone.</p>
      <p>Watch the trailer here, and then we’ll reconvene.</p>

      <p>Bizarre, right? Well, the internet thinks so too. We’re still at ground zero with the trailer in some ways — it dropped a few hours ago. But that hasn’t stopped internet pranksters from turning the thing into a glorious new meme.</p>

      <p>Is the actual movie gonna be as weird as all the marketing materials so far have suggested? I mean, who knows: the world’s so weird that this thing could turn out to be a stately and handsome adaptation with no cursed material whatsoever.</p>
      <p>But somehow, I kinda doubt it.</p>
