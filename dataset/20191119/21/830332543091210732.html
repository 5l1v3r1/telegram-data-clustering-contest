      <p>MADISON, Wis. (AP) - State Supreme Court challenger Jill Karofsky is suggesting incumbent Justice Dan Kelly is corrupt.</p>
      <p>Karofsky made the implications during the candidates' first debate Tuesday at a Madison law firm.</p>
      <p>Kelly is part of the court's conservative-leaning majority. Karofsky said he repeatedly rules in favor of conservative groups, contributing to the perception that the justices make up their minds before anyone gets a chance to argue the case. Twice she said that feels and looks like corruption.</p>
      <p>Kelly countered by saying Karofsky views cases through a political lens. He said applies the law logically and logic doesn't care about personal opinions or beliefs.</p>
