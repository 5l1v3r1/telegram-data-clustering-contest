      <p>So you've just started playing games on <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/how-to-buy-games-on-stadia.html">Stadia</a> on Android or another device and have decided you want to change your name. For whatever reason, 'xxX420Bl4zeItXxx'just isn't cutting it anymore and you need something new.</p>
      <p>We get it. We've all created online personas that were once looked at with great admiration. Only to realize later that <i>just maybe</i> they were a bad decision. We've got some good news and bad news for you.</p>
      <p>First the bad news. You can't directly change your Stadia name in the app or through any other portal the service has. That doesn't mean you can't change it all.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Now the good news. You can <i>potentially </i>change it by contacting Google. And, we've put together a guide to help you do just that as well as change your avatar (which you can do any time you please). If you'd like to see how Stadia performed for us, check out <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/google-stadia-review-cloud-gaming-at-its-best-but-it-wont-kill-pc-or-console.html">our review</a>.</p>
      <h3>Contact Google to change your Stadia name on Android or elsewhere</h3>
      <p>To get the information you need, first you need to open the Android app and tap on your avatar. From there tap on the help menu and scroll to find the <i>create or manage account </i>menu.</p>
      <p>Expand that menu and you'll find a list of options like redeeming Stadia codes, kids and family options, and managing your Stadia account. Which is the option you're looking for.</p>

      <p>In this menu you should see an option for changing settings. Tap that to expand the list of options and Stadia name and avatar will be there. As explained, you can't change your Stadia name yourself, and will need to contact the Stadia team to have this completed.</p>
      <p>At the time of this writing, the words "contact us" under the Stadia name and avatar section has no link associated with it. There also doesn't appear to be any other web portal or link that leads to a contact form for this.</p>
      <p>Chances are, this is where you will go to contact the team and have the name changed, and it's possible the link is just not live yet. Either way, keep you eye on this section of the Stadia Help forum as you may need it.</p>

      <h3>Change your Stadia avatar from the app</h3>
      <p>Changing the avatar is a little simpler, and as mentioned you can change it as much as you want.</p>
      <p>All you need to do is open the Stadia app (which is where you'll <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/how-to-buy-games-on-stadia.html">buy games</a>) on your device. From there tap on your avatar in the top right corner. Here you will see a small note about changing your name, and a large selection of avatar options below it.</p>
      <p>Simply scroll through the avatars and find one that you like. Tap that avatar and it will switch in just a couple of seconds. It's pretty quick, and the avatar changes immediately so there's no waiting on that.</p>

      <p>You can also change the avatar from the Stadia web portal, so you don't actually have to be in the app to do it. In the web portal, when you click your avatar, then click on Stadia settings and this will take you to the page where you can switch out your avatar.</p>
      <p>After you select one it'll ask you to confirm that you want to change the avatar to the one you've chosen. That's it. There's no more to it. Now you can get back to playing games on Stadia.</p>
