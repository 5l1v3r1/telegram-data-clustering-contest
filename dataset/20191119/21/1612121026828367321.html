      <p>The <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/316258-oneplus-5-same-samsung-display-oneplus-3t/">OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T</a> were both very solid phones from a few years ago, before OnePlus really starting to hit the mainstream market. They were really some of the first phones to launch OnePlus into a competitive place, and they’ve been receiving security updates ever since.</p>
      <p>But all good things <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/306872-oneplus-3t-gets-software-update-but-its-not-nougat/">must come to an end</a>. OnePlus has announced that the October 2019 security patch will be the last update that the phone ever sees.</p>
      <p>That’s a long time for any phone, especially when most manufacturers only commit to two years of security updates. OnePlus <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/305748-oneplus-3-will-get-just-as-many-updates-as-the-oneplus-3t/">guaranteed an extra year</a>, making the OnePlus 3/3T a <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/340323-at-long-last-the-oneplus-3-and-3t-get-promised-android-pie/">very well-supported family of phones</a>.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>OnePlus will be rolling out this update in stages, so don’t be alarmed if you don’t get it right away. When you do see it, keep in mind that this is a very small update; we’re looking at an update to the latest security bulletin, plus a couple bug fixes.</p>

          </ul>

      <p>You had a good run, OnePlus 3.</p>
