        <b>TOMORROW marks five years since Nicola Sturgeon became First Minister.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The SNP leader took over from Alex Salmond on November 20, 2014 — two months after the SNP and Yes movement were left heartbroken after the indy referendum defeat.</p>

      <p>The five years that have followed have been dominated by the constitution — Brexit and independence.</p>
      <p>And a mixed record at Holyrood has seen Ms Sturgeon come under fire over the NHS and education, but on the front foot on issues including climate change.</p>
      <p>Her soaring personal popularity in the early days of her tenure has dwindled although the SNP are still riding high in the polls ahead of the General Election in December.</p>
      <p>Tonight, Edinburgh University’s Professor James Mitchell — a leading expert on the SNP and its extraordinary rise since devolution — charts the past five years of The Nicola Sturgeon Show.</p>
      <p>BY any standard, Nicola Sturgeon works hard.</p>
      <p>And in five years as First Minister, that’s included creating an image that advances her career and politics.</p>
      <p>She is on top of detail across a range of policies like no previous First Minister.</p>
      <p>She is a brilliant communicator and debater – so it’s little wonder Boris Johnson is avoiding debating with her ahead of the General Election.</p>

      <p>Ms Sturgeon gets out and about meeting people across Scotland. And she has a tight and very loyal group of close advisers.</p>
      <p>But every strength has its downside.</p>
      <p>Her focus on detail and frenetic range of activities leave little time for reflection.</p>
      <p>She’s a great tactician, better at responding to events than long-term strategist.</p>
      <blockquote>Nicola Sturgeon has been lucky in the underwhelming leaders chosen by other parties, north and south of the border."<cite>Professor James Mitchell</cite></blockquote>
      <p>As Health Secretary, she inherited a department riven with controversies and big challenges.</p>
      <p>The challenges still exist — but she removed the controversies.  Overturning decisions to close Accident and Emergency units in Ayr and Lanarkshire was popular but there was little effort to shift towards a more preventative approach to health that would limit the demand on services.</p>
      <p>Her approach has been the same as First Minister. The watchword has been ‘careful as she goes’, a First Minister with a safe pair of hands.</p>
      <p>Massive efforts went into creating her image by SNP HQ, guided by her husband Peter Murrell.</p>

      <p>To many looking on, the Scottish Government has become The Nicola Sturgeon Show. But governing is about more than image. No other political leader inherited the level of support the SNP had when she became leader.</p>
      <p>The extraordinary General Election result in 2015, when the SNP won 56 seats with 50 per cent of the vote, was her predecessor Alex Salmond’s legacy to her.</p>
      <p>Her job was to increase support for independence beyond the 45 per cent in the 2014 referendum.</p>
      <p>But her personal ratings have slumped since, and her party has fallen back electorally. The loss of 21 seats in 2017 would have finished most politicians.</p>
      <p>But she survived as the SNP was still dazed by its 2014 referendum and 2015 General Election performance.</p>
      <p>She still dominates Scottish politics but has been lucky in the underwhelming leaders chosen by other parties, north and south of the border.</p>
      <p>But her safety-first approach is beginning to make her look uncomfortably like Jack McConnell, Labour’s last First Minister.</p>
      <p>‘Doing less, better’ was his watchword.  The danger facing her is copying him in just doing less. The SNP under Sturgeon looks increasingly like Scottish Labour at its peak — cautious, even conservative with a small ‘c’, moderate to timid. This can work in Scotland where the electorate is not as bold or radical as many pretend.</p>

      <p>But the SNP is not any party.  It wants independence and the SNP has made little, if any progress here despite conditions that should help.</p>
      <p>Support for independence sits at around 50 per cent - not enough to be entirely confident of victory in a second referendum.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson ought to be a recruiting sergeant for the SNP. Labour is deeply divided and the Liberal Democrats look like they have blundered in their choice of leader.</p>
      <p>But support for independence is stuck in the electoral doldrums.</p>
      <p>Political leaders always risk becoming distant, out of touch with the wider public and no amount of manufactured meetings and selfies help.</p>
      <p>It is inevitable, and can be guarded against only by ensuring those close to the leader are able and willing to confront her with realities.</p>
      <p>Loyalty requires truth be told to power rather than warm reassurances. The image makers now need to make way for bold and courageous policy thinkers.</p>
