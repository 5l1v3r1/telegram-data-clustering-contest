      <p>Filipino International Master (IM) Angelo Young (elo 2288) defeated Georgian Grandmaster (GM) Zurab Sturua (elo 2540) to flex his muscles in the FIDE World Seniors 2019 Chess Championships at the Rin Grand Hotel in Bucharest, Romania.</p>
      <p>Young subdued Sturua in their Czech Benoni defense encounter Monday night. The latter resigned after 74 moves.</p>
      <p>The win gave the 31st-seeded Filipino a share of first place with 5.5 points alongside Grandmaster (GM) Vladislav Nevednichy (elo 2518) of Romania, winner over countryman Grandmaster (GM) Mihail Marin (elo 2521).</p>
      <p>“Angelo Young strikes again by claiming his third GM scalp by upsetting Georgian veteran GM Zurba Surua in the sixth round of the World Seniors. He ties Vladislav Nevednichy for the lead with 5.5/6. Both face each other in round 7.” said veteran journalist and chess commentator Ignacio “Iggy” Dee.</p>
      <p>“(Angelo) Young, who appeared to have squandered a big edge by choosing to enter a rook ending instead of forcing lines, proved doubters wrong by squeezing out the win against the former 50 and above champ in a 74-move Czech Benoni,” said Dee.</p>
      <p>Thirteen-time Philippine Open Champion Grandmaster (GM) Rogelio “Joey” Antonio Jr. (elo 2427) settled for a truce with Israeli Grandmaster (GM) Ram Soffer  (elo 2485) in 37 moves of Caro-Kann defense.</p>
      <p>The draw enabled the former University of Manila standout Antonio to raise his score to 4.5 points in six outings in the 50-and-above category. Antonio shares 6th to 17h placers.</p>
      <p>Antonio’s trip is sponsored by the National Chess Federation of the Philippines headed by its chairman/president rep. Prospero “Butch” Pichay Jr., the Philippine Sports Commission, Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor) chair and CEO Andrea Domingo, Prage Ma­nagement Corporation, Xavier School, Mr.Roger Py of Gibi Shoes, engineer Antonio “Tony” Carreon Balinas, San Juan City Chief of Police Col. Jaime Osit Santos and Woman International Master (WIM) Cristine Mariano-Wågman.</p>
      <p>In the 65-and-over section, Fide Master (FM) Cesar Caturla (elo 2276) crushed Marcel Van Herck (elo 2116) of Belgium in 33 moves of English Opening for his 4.5 points. He climbed at 7th to 23rd placers.</p>
      <p>In round 7, Young goes up against Nevednichy, Antonio opposite Grandmaster (GM) Alex Yermolinsky (elo 2498) of the United States while Caturla versus Grandmaster (GM) Vlastimil Jansa (elo 2436) of Czech Republic. </p>
