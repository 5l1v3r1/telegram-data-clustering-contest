      <p>A high-level committee inspected the sewage treatment plant and works under the underground sewerage scheme (UGSS) implemented by the Sathyamangalam municipality to study whether the plant can be relocated.</p>
      <p>The municipality is implementing the scheme at a cost of â‚¹55 crore for which a sewage treatment plant is being constructed at Kottuveerampalayam that is located near River Bhavani. Residents, members of various political parties, traders and welfare associations have opposed the municipalities move to let the treated sewage into the river and wanted the plant to be located five km away from the river. They formed an association, Sathyamangalam Makkal Nala Kootamaippu, and held various protests after which officials at various levels held talks with them. Collector C. Kathiravan held talks with them last week during which it was decided to form a committee to inspect the works and decide on relocation of the plant.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the team comprising engineers from Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board and Public Works Department visited the municipal office and held discussion with the officials. Also, members of the association put forth the drawbacks in the scheme and wanted the anomalies to be rectified. The team later inspected Ayyappan Kovil Padithurai, plant at Kottuveerampalayam and other works in the municipal limits. The team is expected to submit report to the Collector after which a decision on relocating the plant would be taken.</p>
