      <p>A businessman, Azeez Ogunsola, has prayed a Customary Court in Ile-Tuntun, Ibadan to dissolve his 20-year-old union with his wife, Atinuke, whom he called “a serial thief”.</p>
      <p>In his petition, Azeez, said that he can no longer bear the shame which his wife had continually brought on him.</p>
      <p>According to him the humiliation by neighbours and landlords’ association as a result of his wife’s habitual stealing has overwhelmed him.</p>
      <p>“When Atinuke stealing first started, I did not take it too seriously until she graduated into a huge embarrassment for me.</p>
      <p>“Three months ago, I received many phone calls in my office on how my wife was selling neighbours’ domestic animals such as goats.</p>

      <p>“People whose goats were missing in the community have traced it to her selling them in collaboration with her accomplices.</p>
      <p>“Before I knew it, the landlords’ association had ordered my entire family to immediately leave the community or else, they might get me arrested.</p>
      <p>“While I was looking for money to pay for the stolen goat, Atinuke was again engulfed in an allegation of stealing mobile phones from a mosque in the area.</p>
      <p>“She was in an argument with her partner in crime on how to collect her share before she was caught.</p>
      <p>“Besides, Atinuke usually gives me dirty slaps if I dare complain or threaten to marry another wife due to her bad attitudes.</p>
      <p>“In fact, she smashed food plate on my head the last time.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want her to continue to destroy my reputation, please, separate us,” Azeez begged</p>
      <p>However, the respondent opposed the claims and prayed the court not to put an end to her union.</p>
      <p>Atinuke who earned her living as a chemist submitted that she truly stole neighbour’s goats.</p>
      <p>“Azeez is right with the issue of goats and I have promised to change, but I didn’t steal any mobile phone.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know why I am stealing, I have been trying to resolve it spiritually,” Atinuke said.</p>
      <p>After listening to both parties, Chief Henry Agbaje, the President of the court, appealed to the petitioner to exercise more patience.</p>
      <p>Agbaje advised the couple to produce their relatives in court by the Nov. 28 for judgment.</p>
