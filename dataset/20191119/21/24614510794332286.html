      <p>Another day, another all-time high. However, we’re not seeing the euphoric upside rallies that some investors associate with new highs. In fact, it was a very choppy and for the most part, uneventful session in the stock market today.</p>

      <p>The <b>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF</b> (NYSEARCA:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/spy-stock-quote/"><b><u>SPY</u></b></a>) spent most of the session within a few basis points of break-even, while the <b>Nasdaq Composite</b> did slightly better and the <b>Dow Jones Industrial Average</b> slightly worse.</p>
      <p>For the most part, it was a quiet day. But the analysts and the retail sector made some noise.</p>
      <h3>Retail Roundup</h3>
      <p>Oof. It was not a good showing from the retail world. That will likely give pause to the bulls who were looking forward to some nice upside reactions throughout the week.</p>
      <p><b>Home Depot</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/hd-stock-quote/"><b><u>HD</u></b></a>), perhaps one of the most consistent retailers, whiffed on its <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/home-depot-earnings-hit-hd-stock/">third-quarter report</a>. Earnings of $2.53 per share were in line with expectations, while revenue of $27.2 billion missed expectations by roughly $300 million. Comparable-store sales growth missed too, while management lowered its full-year outlook for revenue and comparable-store sales.</p>
      <p><b>Kohl’s</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/kss-stock-quote/"><b><u>KSS</u></b></a>) took it a step further, though. While revenue of $4.6 billion beat estimates by $230 million, sales growth was flat year-over-year. Further, earnings of 74 cents per share missed analysts’ expectations, while <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/kohls-earnings-hammers-kss-stock/">management significantly reduced</a> its full-year guidance. The company now expects earnings in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share against a prior outlook of $5.15 to $5.45 per share and a consensus estimate of $5.19 per share.</p>
      <p>To top it all off, KSS missed on comp-store sales too, growing just 0.4% against expectations for 0.8%. Gross margins came up short as well. No wonder shares fell roughly 20% Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Given that <b>Macy’s</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/m-stock-quote/"><b><u>M</u></b></a>) stock fell more than 10% on the day, many investors likely assumed the company missed on earnings. That’s not the case, as Macy’s reports on Thursday. Instead, the company <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/macys-data-breach-hits-m-stock/">disclosed a data breach</a>. According to Macy’s, it only impacted a small number of customers over a one-week span, but it’s not a good headline to have in the news.</p>
      <p><b>TJX Companies</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tjx-stock-quote/"><b><u>TJX</u></b></a>) was one of the few bright spots Tuesday, if you want to call it that. Shares ended higher by less than 3% despite a pretty solid report. Earnings of 68 cents per share beat estimates by 2 cents, while revenue of $10.5 billion grew 6.3% year-over-year and topped expectations by $140 million.</p>
      <p>Comp-store sales growth of 4% easily topped estimates of 2.3% growth. So why isn’t the stock up more? While its peers aren’t doing TJX any favors, consider the guidance. Management’s full-year earnings outlook range of $2.61 to $2.63 per share was slightly ahead of the $2.61 consensus. However, TJX’s Q4 earnings outlook of 74 cents to 76 cents per share came up short of expectations at 77 cents per share.</p>
      <p>In other words, the full-year outlook is slightly ahead of estimates because of Q3, not the current Q4 results.</p>
      <h3>Movers in the Stock Market Today</h3>
      <p><b>AT&amp;T</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/t-stock-quote/"><b><u>T</u></b></a>) stock slumped over 5.5% at one point on Tuesday. After hitting new 52-week highs on Monday, one would think the market was really pulling back in order for this to happen.</p>
      <p>Instead, it was a downgrade. The stock was downgraded to “sell” at MoffettNathanson, as the analysts assigned a $30 price target. The analyst makes his case based on valuation and deteriorating fundamentals. At 11 times earnings with a 5.1% dividend yield, many investors may not see it that way, though.</p>
      <p>AT&amp;T, Home Depot, Macy’s and TJX were all picks for <i>InvestorPlace’s</i> <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/5-top-stock-trades-for-wednesday-t-m-tjx-hd-kl/">Top Stock Trades column on Tuesday</a>.</p>
      <p>On the other end of the spectrum was <b>Broadcom</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/avgo-stock-quote/"><b><u>AVGO</u></b></a>). Shares rocketed over $325 in the opening minutes of Tuesday’s session, a rally that was sparked by Morgan Stanley analysts. They upgraded the stock to an “overweight” rating and labeled it a top pick, assigning a $387 price. While AVGO hit new 52-week highs on the move, it could not maintain those highs, closing at just $317.70.</p>
      <p>Despite its recent woes, <b>Boeing</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/ba-stock-quote/"><b><u>BA</u></b></a>) is still grabbing a few new orders. Its troubled 737 MAX jet — the one that is currently grounded worldwide — <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3520331-vote-confidence-737-max-orders-inked-dubai">received</a> 50 orders for the jet at the Dubai Air Show.</p>
      <p><b>Slack</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/work-stock-quote/"><b><u>WORK</u></b></a>) took it on the chin Tuesday, falling almost 9%. The decline comes after <b>Microsoft</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/msft-stock-quote/"><b><u>MSFT</u></b></a>) <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/microsoft-teams-reaches-20m-daus-pushing-ahead-against-slack/">has grown</a> its Teams platform from 13 million daily active users (DAUs) in July to 20 million at last check. For reference, Slack had 12 million DAUs as of last month.</p>
