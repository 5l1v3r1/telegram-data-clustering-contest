      <p><b>(Gray News) - </b>Taco about a unique Thanksgiving side.</p>
      <p>Taco Bell published a recipe for chicken taco bisque on its blog, and it promises this recipe will “be the star of your Friendsgiving.”</p>
      <p>The recipe starts normal enough by sauteing onions and garlic in a cast iron stockpot, and then adding spices, broth and tomatoes. That’s where it stops feeling so conventional.</p>
      <p>Then the recipe asks you to put six rolled chicken tacos, cut into pieces, into the pot.</p>
      <p>You blend it all up with some heavy cream.</p>
      <p>It’s suggested to serve the soup with a side of more rolled chicken tacos, for dipping.</p>
      <p>If you do end up making the soup, the fast food chain suggests you use #RolledChickenTacosBisque on social media.</p>
      <p>You can <a href="https://www.tacobell.com/blog/friendsgiving-rolled-chicken-tacos-bisque-recipe">view the entire recipe here</a>.</p>
