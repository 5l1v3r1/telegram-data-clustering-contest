      <p><b>Johnny Depp</b> and <b>Angelina Jolie</b> haven’t had much to do with each other since co-starring in <i>The Tourist</i> nearly a decade ago, but that hasn’t stopped the tabloids from publishing phony reports involving the two of them. <b>Gossip Cop</b> has debunked many bogus articles surrounding the relationship between the two stars. Here are a few examples.</p>
      <p>In September 2017, <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted <i>Star</i> for falsely claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/angelina-jolie-not-dating-johnny-depp-revenge-romance/">Jolie was in a “revenge romance” with Depp following her split from Brad Pitt</a>. The outlet maintained that “sparks flew” between Jolie and Depp on the set of <i>The Tourist</i> years prior, but the timing wasn’t right because the actress was still with Pitt. In the wake of her breakup, according to an alleged insider, Jolie was looking for “payback” by hooking up with her former co-star.</p>
      <p>The supposed source further maintained that the two were meeting up for “trysts” at “exotic offshore locations,” but these locales were never named. An individual in Depp’s camp assured us the story was “completely false,” and a source close to Jolie confirmed it. The former co-stars haven’t been spotted together since the 2010 premiere of <i>The Tourist</i>.</p>
      <p>In May 2018, <b>Gossip Cop</b> called out <i>NW</i> for making up a story about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/angelina-jolie-saving-johnny-depp/">Jolie coming to Depp’s “rescue” amid his tumultuous divorce</a> from Amber Heard and a legal battle against his former managers. The tabloid claimed the actor would be staying at Jolie’s house in England while she filmed the <i>Maleficent</i> sequel, and he was happy to “have her on his side.”</p>
      <p>In reality, the magazine was simply exploiting Depp’s personal difficulties with a fake article involving his former co-star. Jolie had absolutely nothing to do with the situation. Making the story even more baseless was the fact that the actor was touring with his band, Hollywood Vampires, at the time it was published. He wasn’t crashing at Jolie’s house in the UK in between gigs.</p>
      <p>One month later, <i>Woman’s Day</i> came up with a similar premise, but decided to focus on Depp’s physical health instead of his emotional well-being. The outlet maintained that <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/angelina-jolie-johnny-depp-health/">Jolie had offered to help Depp get healthy</a> after he was spotted looking thinner than usual while signing autographs for fans in Russia. An unknown source said the actress had been “phoning and texting him several times a day” while he was on tour, offering her support “to get him back to health.”</p>
      <p>The tabloid didn’t bother to elaborate on how Jolie planned to be his caretaker, especially since she was in London filming <i>Maleficent: Mistress of Evil</i>, while Depp was touring across Europe with his band. Around the same time, reputable outlets such as <i>People</i> magazine, <i>Entertainment Tonight</i> and E! News all correctly reported that Depp was healthy and having a great time on the road. Although it’s true some fans expressed concern about the actor’s apparent weight loss at the time, a Depp insider assured us there was no reason to worry. Time has proven that the actor is perfectly fine.</p>
      <p>And just last month, <b>Gossip Cop</b> debunked a <i>Woman’s Day</i> story about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/angelina-jolie-johnny-depp-michelle-pfeiffer/">Michelle Pfeiffer playing matchmaker for Depp and Jolie</a>. Pfeiffer, who co-stars with Jolie in the <i>Maleficent</i> sequel, worked with Depp twice in the past. These professional connections seem to be the only reason the bogus story was invented.</p>
      <p>A questionable source said Pfeiffer believed the two stars would be “perfect together,” especially considering that they’ve both been going through bitter divorces. It was further alleged that Jolie was hesitant about dating “another high-profile actor,” but her <i>Maleficent 2</i> co-star assured her that Depp had spent the past few years “soul-searching, having therapy and dealing with a lot of his own issues.”</p>
      <p>The entire premise was based on the word of an unidentified insider, but Pfeiffer’s own rep told us on the record that it was made-up. Meanwhile, an individual close to Jolie told us the actress was focused on her career and raising her kids. She’s not concerned with dating anyone at this time, let alone Depp. We’re approaching a decade since the release of <i>The Tourist</i>, but these phony articles involving the former co-stars show no sign of stopping.</p>
