      <h1>Arsenal Vs Southampton: Unai Emery must break tendencies</h1>
      <h2>Unai Emery is a naturally conservative manager. However, when Arsenal host Southampton, he has a chance to break his tendencies, one that he must take to satisfy the baying supporters.</h2>

      <p>There are many frustrating elements of the management approach of <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=arsenal">Arsenal</a> head coach<a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=unai+emery"> Unai Emery</a>. From the lack of identity of the team because of his consistent tinkering to his repeated use of players in the wrong positions and roles, the Gunners under Emery have become an infuriating beast.</p>

      <p>However, for all of the intricacies that have driven supporters around the bend this season, perhaps the most obdurate is Emery’s naturally cautious and conservative nature, something that leads his team to struggle to put games to bed and dismantle lesser opponents.</p>
      <p>Many of Arsenal’s worst performances under Emery have come against bottom-14 sides in the Premier League. This last batch of four games between the international break saw them fain just two points from matches against Sheffield United, Crystal Palace, Wolves, and Leicester City. In all competitions, they blew late leads in four successive games, Palace, Liverpool, Wolves and Vitoria SC, while they are yet to win a league game by more than one goal. All this points to one fairly obvious thing: Emery’s conservative approach is hurting his team.</p>
      <p>On Saturday,<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/arsenal-vs-southampton-premier-league-time-kick-off-tv-channel/"> the Gunners play host to Southampton</a>. The Saints have just eight points from 12 games, are second-bottom of the Premier League, and have just one point from their last seven league games. Even more pertinently, they have conceded 24 goals in those seven games, an average of more than three per game. If there is ever a game in which Emery should feel the freedom to unleash his attack, this is it.</p>

      <p>First and foremost, Emery’s side is at home. They have largely been very good at the Emirates. The onus is on them to take the game to Southampton, who would, I am sure, be very happy with a point. Secondly, and more importantly, Emery has the better players at his disposal, and this is something that he has failed to take advantage of in the past.</p>
      <p>Mesut Ozil is the ideal attacking midfielder to field in this type of game. He should see a lot of the ball and can prise openings for his teammates to create and score. Nicolas Pepe, too, will have situations where he can drive at defenders in one-on-ones, Hector Bellerin from right-back engineering space on overlapping runs as Arsenal exercise their control of the match. There is no need for three defensive midfielders in this type of game against this type of opponent.</p>
      <p>And yet, you cannot help but feel that Emery is struggling to break away from his natural tendencies, that he wants to win this game 1-0 with a scrappy Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang strike and embattled defensive display.</p>
      <p>These are the games that supporters want Emery to unleash his talent in. So far, he has been tentative to do so. With the ever-increasing pressure now mounting, maybe that will change this weekend.</p>
