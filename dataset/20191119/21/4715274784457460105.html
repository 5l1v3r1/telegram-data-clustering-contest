      <p>That will be answered as slumping teams TNT KaTropa and San Miguel Beer get the chance to redeem themselves with a spot in the top four at stake in the final elimination round playdate of the 2019 Philippine Basketball Association Governors’ Cup.</p>
      <p>The Tropang Texters (7-3) and the Beermen (6-4) go all out for a slot in the top four in their highly-anticipated 7 p.m. clash at the Ynares Center in Antipolo City tomorrow night.</p>
      <p>Already a lock at No. 2, NLEX (8-2) just looks to gain momentum heading to the quarters when it faces Alaska (4-6), who will be fighting for an outright berth in the next round, at 4:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>The Road Warriors, win or lose, will be the top seed in the quarters and already own a twice-to-beat incentive.</p>
      <p>The Aces need to win to formalize their entry to the quarters and move up to No. 7, sliding NorthPort to No. 8.</p>
      <p>A loss for the Aces sends them to a playoff for the last quarters ticket against Columbian Dyip.</p>
      <p>The victor between San Miguel and TNT will be guaranteed a spot in the top four, and the coveted twice-to-beat incentive, while the loser slides to No. 5 and will have a twice-to-win disadvantage instead in the next phase.</p>
      <p>The Tropang Texters and the Beermen both started out the conference on fire.</p>
      <p>TNT blazed hot with a seven-game winning streak for a 7-0 start but had suddenly struggled, losing three in a row despite the acquisition of prized rookie Bobby Ray Parks.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, San Miguel, after starting with a 4-0 slate, had only managed to win two of its last six games.</p>
      <p>Also, the Beermen are currently experiencing internal conflicts as just last Sunday, key players Arwind Santos, Ronald Tubid and Kelly Nabong were involved in an altercation alongside import Dez Wells. </p>
