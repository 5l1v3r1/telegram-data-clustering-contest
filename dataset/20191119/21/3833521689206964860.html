      <h1>Trudeau to move Freeland, name Champagne foreign minister: CBC report</h1>

      <p>Justin Trudeau will put a new minister in charge of managing relations with the U.S. and China when he unveils his new cabinet Wednesday, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.</p>
      <p>The Canadian prime ministerer, who was re-elected to a second term with a weakened mandate last month, will name Francois-Philippe Champagne as foreign minister, the CBC reported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources.</p>
      <p>Champagne, who was named trade minister in 2017 before moving to infrastructure last year, would take the reins as the nation’s top diplomat from Chrystia Freeland. She successfully negotiated a new North American free trade agreement with President Donald Trump’s administration and attempted to quell a bitter feud with Beijing stemming from Canada’s arrest of a top Huawei Technologies Co. executive on an American extradition request.</p>
      <p>The state broadcaster didn’t say what Freeland’s new position will be on Trudeau’s front bench, though she is expected to help the prime minister quell a growing sense of western alienation. The Liberals failed to elected a single lawmaker in the oil-producing provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, where the former journalist was born.</p>
      <p>While moving Freeland would represent a substantial shake-up for Trudeau, he’s expected to maintain a sense of continuity by keeping Bill Morneau in place as finance minster, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported last week, also citing unnamed sources.</p>
      <p>British Columbia lawmaker Jonathan Wilkinson will become environment minister, the CBC said, and Montreal’s Pablo Rodriguez will take over as government house leader -- a key position in a minority parliament.</p>
      <p>The prime minister will unveil the new cabinet lineup Wednesday afternoon at 1:30 p.m. in Ottawa, according to an advisory from the governor general’s office.</p>
