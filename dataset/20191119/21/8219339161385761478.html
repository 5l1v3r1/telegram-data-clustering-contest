      <h1>Now live: Watch Tim Cook chat with Marc Benioff at Salesforce conference</h1>

      <p>The Salesforce Dreamforce conference is hosting a fireside chat interview with Apple CEO Tim Cook and Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff …</p>
      <p>The Dreamforce conference is being held at the Yerba Buena Theater in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t matter if you aren’t attending the conference. <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/video/7597891/">Salesforce is live streaming</a> the segment for your enjoyment right now.</p>
      <p>However, be warned that the subject matter may not be particularly interesting. Don’t expect much talk about Apple’s consumer products.</p>
      <p>The topics are likely to be heavily enterprise-centric. The session is described as a way to learn how Salesforce and Apple ignite productivity and learning on the best devices for business.</p>
      <p>Apple and Salesforce entered a formal partnership in 2018 to help advance the penetration of iPhone and iPad in enterprise markets. This week, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/18/apple-and-salesforce/">Salesforce released some of the fruits</a> of that relationship in the form of a new Salesforce mobile app and SDK integrations.</p>
