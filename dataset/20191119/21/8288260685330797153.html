      <h1>Tories slammed after rebranding Twitter account as FactCheckUK during ITV Leaders Debate</h1>
      <h2>The Conservative Campaign Headquarters press office account was renamed "factcheckUK" during Tuesday evening's ITV broadcast, offering commentary on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's statements and retweeting messages supporting Boris Johnson</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:38:32+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:38</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>The Conservative Party has faced criticism after one of its official Twitter accounts was rebranded as a fact checking service during the ITV leaders' debate.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Campaign Headquarters press office account was renamed "factcheckUK" during Tuesday evening's ITV broadcast, offering commentary on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's statements and retweeting messages supporting Boris Johnson.</p>
      <p>The move was criticised by independent fact-checking charity Full Fact, which tweeted: "It is inappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their twitter account 'factcheckUK' during this debate. Please do not mistake it for an independent fact checking service such as @FullFact, @FactCheck or @FactCheckNI"</p>
      <p>The @CCHQpress account is verified by Twitter, displaying a blue tick which is intended to denote that a user is genuine.</p>

      <p>The Liberal Democrat press office posted an image suggesting they were reporting the account to Twitter for "pretending to be me or someone else".</p>
      <p>They tweeted: "And people wonder why trust in politics has been eroded @CCHQPress"</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Labour's David Lammy tweeted: "The Conservative Party press office @CCHQPress rebranding themselves as 'FactCheckUK' shows what disdain this party and this government has for the truth."</p>
      <p>"The Electoral Commission must investigate and punish this blatant attempt to decieve the public."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, some other Twitter users also changed their display names to factcheckUK and posted critical comments about Mr Johnson.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Others changed their display name CCHQ Press Office, while Tony Blair's former spokesperson Alastair Campbell changed his display name to Boris Johnson and tweeted: "I won't get Brexit done £FactCheck"</p>
      <p>The Conservative Party has been contacted for comment.</p>
