      <p>Nokia announced that it secured a 50th 5G deal thanks to the Spark New Zealand. This operator chose Nokia to deliver radio access network technology for the rollout of its 5G network. Nokia will be deploying its AirScale RAN solution at more than 200 sites so the Spark could offer new services to its customers. Nokia has been cooperating with Spark before, and earlier this year they did New Zealandâ€™s first 5G trial that took place in Alexandra, South Island. Finns are currently working with Spark to extend its 5G network to an additional 5 sites before the Christmas period.</p>

      <p>Nokia proudly announced that they already have more than 120 private wireless network customers which are important for building the Industry 4.0 concept that Nokia is so heavily promoting. The networks have already been deployed for various businesses across the globe, and those customers can already enjoy the next industrial era. Nokia is offering a 5G-ready portfolio, expanded ecosystem, and industry-wide customer adoption, so the enterprizes could gain an advantage over those who are still waiting to improve itself.<br/>The Private wireless networking market is estimated to be worth over US$16 billion by 2025, according to ABI Research. Nokia is now a leader in that area that has a great opportunity for growth and can improve its own financial situation.</p>
