      <h1>Election debate: Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corby reveal what they'd get each other for Christmas</h1>
      <h2>Lets be honest you basically wouldn't want to be getting a gift from either of these two if this was anything to go by</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:15:30+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:15</time> by <a rel="author">Oliver Milne, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/oliver-milne/</a></address>
      <p>Not even the festive spirit can soothe the tense relationship between <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>.</p>
      <p>If we had any doubt about how the pair really felt about each other, they were dispelled in tonight's fractious debate.</p>
      <p>But in an attempt to bring some Christmas reconciliation at the end of the studio showdown in Salford, one audience member thought he'd get them both to think generously.</p>
      <p>Asked what they would leave under the Christmas tree for one another - both decided to double down on their political messages.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn said he would give the Prime Minister "'A Christmas Carol' by Charles Dickens" so that he could "learn about Scrooge".</p>

      <p>Boris Johnson on the other hand was even less imaginary and said he would leave the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leade a copy of his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> deal.</p>
      <p>Pushed by Julie Etchingham to come up with a better answer he eventually offered up "some damson jam.”</p>
      <p>The leaders of the UK's two major parties went head-to-head in an hour-long debate hosted by Julie Etchingham in Salford's MediaCityUK.</p>
      <p>It gave Mr Corbyn an opportunity to make up ground on the Conservatives as opinion polls showed Labour trailing behind. </p>
      <p>But Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon branded Mr Johnson a "scaredy-cat" over his refusal to debate her, saying she would face him "any time, any place".</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems and the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> yesterday lost a High Court battle to have their leaders included in the debate.</p>
      <p>In his closing remarks, Mr Corbyn urged viewers to register to vote in a "once-in-a-generation election".</p>
      <p>He added: "This is a once-in-a-generation election to end privatisation and give the National Health Service the funding it needs. To give people the final say and get Brexit sorted.</p>
      <p>"To tackle the climate emergency that threatens our futures. To invest good jobs in every region and nation of our country.</p>
      <p>"I ask that you vote for hope and vote Labour on December 12."</p>
