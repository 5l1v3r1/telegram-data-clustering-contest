      <p>STOCKHOLM: A Swedish prosecutor said on Tuesday (Nov 19) she would not proceed with an investigation into an allegation of rape against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange after a review of the evidence.</p>
      <p>Deputy Chief Prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson said that the complainant's evidence was deemed credible and reliable, but that after nearly a decade, witnesses' memories had faded.</p>

      <p>"After conducting a comprehensive assessment of what has emerged during the course of the preliminary investigation I then make the assessment that the evidence is not strong enough to form the basis for filing an indictment," Persson told a news conference.</p>
      <p>The 48 year-old Australian citizen has repeatedly denied the allegation against him, made in 2010.</p>
      <p>The move by the prosecutor heads off a possible dilemma for the British courts which could potentially have had to decide between competing extradition requests from the United States and Sweden. </p>
      <p>However, the prosecutor said the decision to drop the investigation could be appealed.</p>
      <p>Assange is being held in a British jail pending a hearing in February on extradition to the United States, which wants the 48 year-old Australian citizen over 18 criminal counts including conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law.</p>
      <p>He was dragged from the Ecuadorian embassy in London in April this year after spending almost seven years holed up there to avoid extradition on the Swedish allegations. </p>
      <p>Since then, he has served a British jail sentence for skipping bail.</p>
