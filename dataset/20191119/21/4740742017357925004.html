      <h1>Why this Fishponds Library will be closed for a week</h1>
      <h2>It follows community library conversations which took place at the start of the year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:08:20+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:08</time> by <a rel="author">Alexander Brock</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/">Bristol</a> library will be closed for a week while it undergoes improvement works to allow for more space.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/fishponds">Fishponds</a> Library will be shut from Monday (November 25) while a wall is removed as part of the revamp.</p>
      <p>It follows community library conversations which took place at the start of the year, where local people mentioned they would like to see a better layout and more space within the library.</p>
      <p>Deputy Mayor Councillor Asher Craig, cabinet member with responsibility for libraries, said: “We are committed to making sure our library service meets the needs of the community and the city as a whole, and we are working with local people and organisations to make this happen.</p>
      <p>“The feedback from the people who use Fishponds Library is that they wanted more space, so we are making that happen.</p>
      <p>“We are sorry for any inconvenience caused during this closure, but we hope that the work will help improve the library experience for the local community.”</p>
      <p>The Library Innovation Fund will see just over £100,000 split between the city’s 27 libraries and will enable communities to put ideas they have about their local library into action.</p>
      <p>Projects could range from buying furniture or equipment to funding activities such as creative writing workshops.</p>
