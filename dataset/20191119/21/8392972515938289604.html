      <h1>I'm A Celebrity: Jacqueline Jossa's tears despite nailing Bushtucker Trial</h1>
      <h2>She faced her fears like a legend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:51:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:51</time> by <a rel="author">Karen Hyland</a></address>
      <p>Snake Rock's Famous Five - James, Ian, Caitlyn, Jacqueline and Andrew - took on tonight's Bushtucker Trial, Face Your Fears, on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a>.</p>
      <p>Each of them had to put their head into a clear Perspex helmet and their hands into a box.</p>
      <p>They had two minutes to release two stars using the tools provided.</p>
      <p>There were two stars each, making a total of 10 possible stars and 10 meals for camp.</p>
      <p>And poor Jac was reduced to tears just watching her campmates in action, ahead of her turn.</p>
      <p>"I feel like this is too soon to cry but I'm going to cry"" she said.</p>

      <p>Going last, Jac told Ant and Dec that her biggest fear is spiders, before revealing her shaking hands.</p>
      <p>And then something magical happened. Taking deep breaths to calm herself, the former EastEnders star unscrewed first one star, and then a second.</p>
      <p>Her campmates cheered as they were informed they'd won seven stars collectively.</p>
      <p>But it was all too much for the mum-of-two, who burst into tears again.</p>

      <p>And, although I'm A Celeb viewers aren't normally fans of campmates turning on the waterworks, they were seriously impressed with Jac's determination.</p>
