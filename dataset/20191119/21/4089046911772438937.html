      <p><b>JEFFERSON CITY, Tenn. (WVLT) - </b>Children run into the outdoor courtyard at <a href="http://jes.jc-schools.net/">Jefferson Elementary School</a> for what feels a little like recess. They carry small notebooks and pencils, scanning the grassy area for signs of life. This is their chance to be citizen scientists.</p>
      <p>STEAM Extended Learning Site Coordinator Kara Campbell said the program offers education as many afternoons as possible beyond normal school hours. "This extends what a classroom teacher wants to do in their 7 to 3 time."</p>
      <p>While Campbell said the school received a grant for its after school program, this does not cover all of the enrichment the school wants to provide in science, technology, engineering, art, agriculture and math.<br/>So, the school allows community partners to donate time and resources to help.</p>
      <p>"We're working on like finding living things," said Bryce.</p>
      <p>Students debate while searching for signs of outdoor life, "A fly is a bug, not an animal. Bugs are animals."</p>
      <p>"So we're acting in a citizen science capacity today," explained Donna Russert, who organizes a science activity for students through the <a href="https://www.outdoorlearninginitiative.com/?fbclid=IwAR33rqHNVhUOvwmsEhLMw1ufoM4TlKSLLoxRFr6OtJQ5Yak43cDdHbzcqzE">Outdoor Learning Initiative.</a> She used a grant from Jefferson City entrepreneur Jeremy Reed of <a href="https://www.wvlt.tv/content/news/hhttps://www.pursuepeacetrainforwar.com/">Pursue Outfitters.</a> He was invited to join the class. "When I was a kid, I wanted to be a scientist. I was always outdoors," said the dad who would rather focus on community efforts than traditional advertising.</p>
      <p>The students, gaining their own perspective on science.<br/>"Well, scientists have to work, I think a lot," said Emlie.</p>
      <p>Nayeli said, "Scientists have to really look at it and have a close look."</p>
