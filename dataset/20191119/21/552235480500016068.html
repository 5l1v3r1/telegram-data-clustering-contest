      <h1>Leigh Griffiths makes Celtic goalscoring return as he nets reserve double</h1>
      <h2>The Hoops star is back among the goals ahead of a huge month for his club.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:31:26+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:31</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Celtic striker <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leigh-griffiths">Leigh Griffiths</a> was back among the goals as he grabbed a double for the club's reserve team.</p>
      <p>The Hoops youngsters took on Stenhousemuir in a friendly at Lennoxtown with Griffiths handed a striking role.</p>
      <p>He hasn't played for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic's</a> first team since a 12 minute cameo against Hearts in August.</p>
      <p>But he made an instant impact for the second string by scoring after 11 minutes. The 29-year-old was picked out by David McKay and heÂ slipped the ball into the back of the net.</p>
      <p>Griffiths added a second three minutes later and this time it was former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> youngster Liam Burt who provided the assist.</p>

      <p>Burt moved across the divide in the summer and he played a stunning through ball to Griffiths who smashed it past the keeper.</p>
      <p>Burt then grabbed a double of his own as Celtic cruised into a dominant lead before half time and he got his hat-trick 10 minutes into the second half. Cameron Harper added a sixth.</p>
      <p>Also involved for the Hoops was Ireland U21 striker Jonathan Afolabi, who will be hoping to make his first team debut this season.</p>
      <p>A return to form for Griffiths would be good news for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> as he heads into some tough fixtures.</p>
      <p>With 10 games over December before the winter break, the Hoops had looked likely to be relying on Odsonne Edouard.</p>
