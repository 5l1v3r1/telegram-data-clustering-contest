      <h1>Are parents neglecting learners with special needs?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:02:31+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:02</time> by <a rel="author">Yudaya Nangonzi</a></address>
      <p>Children aged four to five are expected in preschool to prepare for primary education. However, some learners with special educational needs may exceed this age without attending any formal education. This is attributed to the persistent negative attitude of some parents, writes YUDAYA NANGONZI.</p>
      <p>At seven years, Imran Kalibbala is in baby class at Bishop West Boarding primary school in Mukono municipality. He enrolled this term; marking his first time in a class.</p>
      <p>It’s a few minutes to lunch and a letter sound lesson is ongoing. While other learners with hearing and speech impairments like him are active, he lays on the desk. He is visibly angry as he licks his finger. When the bell rings, he sprints out of the class, forcing me to follow him. He enters another class, slams the door and mocks me through the window. </p>
      <p>It takes the intervention of his head teacher, Lydia Nakachwa, to alert me that he has multiple disorders; mental retardation, speech and hearing impairments, and a bit of autism.</p>
      <p>“He takes long to understand and cannot concentrate in one place. To help him, you must understand what he likes. By the time he reported, he would enter one class after the other but has since changed,” Nakachwa says.</p>

      <p>On how he picks the sound of the bell, Nakachwa gives credit to hearing aids he received three weeks ago. “When he hears something, he smiles and touches his aids [mounted onto the ears]. This is going to change him completely. He will become very loving, sensitive and start socializing with other learners,” she says.</p>
      <p>There are 289 learners at this inclusive school. Of these, 68 have special educational needs while 35 are deaf. A partnership with government and US-based Starkey Hearing Foundation has seen at least 1,554 learners from 296 specialised primary schools in 79 districts fitted with hearing aids under the Uganda Teacher and School Effectiveness Project.</p>
      <p>At Bishop West PS, some 32 learners are proud beneficiaries. A pair costs Shs 3m. According to Dr Alfred Mwamba from Starkey, there are 466 million people with hearing impairments worldwide with World Health Organisation (WHO) indicating that between 1.5 and 2.5 million Ugandans have some level of disabling hearing impairment.</p>
      <p>“This is a humanitarian crisis for Uganda which cannot be taken lightly. This is now a hearing revolution for Uganda... You cannot learn if you can’t hear. Hearing loss is not visible and very embarrassing to shout at someone with such a disability,” Mwamba says.</p>
      <p>
        <b>ARE CHILDREN LEARNING?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hearing aids are small electronic or battery-operated devices that can amplify and change sound. However, they don’t restore normal hearing, while it takes time to appreciate the different sounds transmitted by the device.</p>
      <p>Nakachwa says children with mild to moderate hearing have improved in classroom activities.</p>
      <p>“The attitude has changed and they communicate well. When you ring the bell, they no longer need to first look at other children running to tell whether it’s break, lunch or parade time,” she says.</p>
      <p>In lessons like Mathematics, they don’t allow interpreters in class to allow children learn lip-reading with support from the aids. </p>
      <p>Speaking through an interpreter, Kalibbala deaf teacher Esther Senkubuge says he pays more attention with hearing aids.</p>
      <p>“With drawing, he can scribble something but I have to hold his hand while writing letters and numbers,” she says, adding that he is not put on tests being his first time in a class in order to interest him in studies.</p>
      <p>She observes that learners without supportive parents or guardians continue to perform poorly in class since they enroll late in school.</p>
      <p>
        <b>INDISPOSED PARENTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>For Kalibbala’s long stay at home, his parents argued that they had no idea about a school that would accommodate him. They couldn’t also afford the school’s boarding fees of Shs 526,000 currently paid by a good Samaritan.</p>
      <p>Roselyn Namubiru, a special needs teacher, says for parents that cannot afford fees, home schooling is another option for such learners. This was not done for Kalibbala.</p>
      <p>“When you give him something to eat, he can’t hold it. You have to throw at him everything and this is a weakness at home. Some parents are so complicated as if they don’t want their children,” Namubiru says.</p>
      <p>With scholastic materials, she adds that parents provide “as and when they wish.”</p>
      <p>For instance, she notes that there are special-needs learners in primary five that report with only six books yet the school needs at least two dozen.</p>
      <p>As if this is not enough! Nakachwa says when the term begins; some parents bring learners after a month and are often the last to be picked from school for holidays.</p>
      <p>“There’s no year the term ends and children with special needs are collected on the first day. Majority are picked late in the evening and after three to four days or even a week. When we contact the parents, they decline to pick our calls,” Nakachwa explains.</p>
      <p>“When we ask teachers to escort the children to home, parents don’t refund their money. Such learners are hard to manage but you have to appreciate that God blessed you with this child.”</p>
      <p>Her most annoying moment arose when parents were asked to sign for children’s hearing aids free of charge but did not bring them for screening.</p>
      <p>At the closure of second term, the school organised a special meeting for parents with learners who received the aids but a few turned up.</p>
      <p>Nakachwa urges government to a organise a national sensitisation campaign about learners with special needs as well as extend subvention grants to special and inclusive schools to attract more needy learners to schools.</p>
      <p>
        <b>EDUCATION MINISTRY SPEAKS</b>
      </p>
      <p>The commissioner, Secondary Education Standards, Benson Kule, who visited Bishop West PS, says the ministry shall not sanction but first engage parents to appreciate the situation of their children.</p>
      <p>He was also bothered to learn that some parents did not sign for children’s hearing aids while those who did, leave them at school during holidays. Only four, of the 32 beneficiaries, carry the aids home while others cannot maintain them.</p>
      <p>“These hearing aids should not only be an excitement at school but used anytime. It is worse to hear that even when government has sourced for the aids, parents are not bothered,” Kule says.</p>
      <p>Recently, the World Bank asked government to finalise processes for the national inclusive education policy to protect children like Kalibbala with learning disabilities. Through its education specialist, Diana S. Bagarukayo, the bank said the policy has been in draft for long.</p>
      <p>She urged government to follow up on the beneficiaries to ensure that the aids are serviced and kept clean.</p>
      <p>“In field visits, we found children with excessive wax in the ears but labelled deaf. Their ears were cleared but this speaks a lot on the lack of sensitisation of parents and communities that needs to be addressed,” Bagarukayo said.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the draft policy, the commissioner for Special Needs Education, Negris Onen, says it had been overtaken by events.</p>
      <p>“It’s true that the policy has been in draft for long. The one being referred to was developed five years ago; when we looked at it, the content was no longer relevant to date,” Onen says.</p>
      <p>“A year ago, we embarked on the process again to develop the new National Inclusive Education Policy. I think a year is not too long and we hope to finalise soon,” So far, regional and national consultations have closed.</p>
      <p>In about six months, in-house consultations will start at the ministry before presenting the policy to top management for discussion.  </p>
