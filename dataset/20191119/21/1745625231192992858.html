      <h3>Sierra Skye Is Stunning In Sexy Tie-Dye Bikini That Shows Off Her Curves</h3>

      <p>Bombshell <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/sierra-skye/">Sierra Skye</a> has posted yet another sexy photograph on her Instagram feed. The stunner is wearing nothing but a skimpy black and white tie-dye bikini as she leans against the interior of a large vehicle. Sierra’s bikini is possibly from the PrettyLittleThing clothing brand as the model tagged them in her caption.</p>
      <p>The model looks sexy and serene as she focuses on a spot in the distance with her hand grazing her dirty blond locks. The ravishing beauty has opted for a messy updo that allows a few stray curls to hang down and frame her elegant facial features. It looks like Sierra decided against any make-up in her picture or is at least favoring a more natural palette.</p>
      <p>The top of her string bikini shows off quite a bit of the beauty’s breasts. Her ample cleavage is plenty visible and accented by a large silver cross pendant. Due to the way the fabric is cupping her chest, Sierra is giving her fans a teasing look at some sideboob too. Other accessories include a simple silver necklace on her right wrist and a large pair of silver hoop earrings.</p>
      <p>Sierra’s matching bottoms are pulled upwards so the bands wrap higher across her slender waist to reveal the curve of her perky rear end along with the smooth expanse of her inner thighs and the sides of her pelvic region. Sierra is not shy about flaunting her best physical assets to her 4.4 million followers.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5750187/sierra-skye-shows-off-behind-instagram/">The Inquisitr</a></i> previously reported Sierra’s photograph from yesterday in which the blond is seen showing off her behind in a string thong and little else. Aside from the barely-there panties, the blond bombshell only wore a small white crop top.</p>
      <p>If yesterday was about flaunting her backside, then today Sierra decided to even the playing field with a focus on her toned abdomen and bountiful breasts. Both new Instagram updates give fans an eyeful of Sierra’s perfect tan.</p>

      <p>“I think I just found my new lock screen wallpaper,” said one of Sierra’s fans. They further showed how pleased they were by the photo by adding several heart and flame emoji.</p>
      <p>“You get more and more beautiful,” complimented another adoring fan.</p>
      <p>“[B]eautiful enchanting sexy wonderful,” said a third user with a kiss emoji.</p>
      <p>“God took his time here, that’s for sure. Lol have a blessed week,” c0mmented a fourth person.</p>
