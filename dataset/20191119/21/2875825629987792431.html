      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino was ready to quit in June - if Spurs had won the Champions League</h1>
      <h2>Defeat to Liverpool in the Champions League final in Madrid persuaded Pochettino not to leave Tottenham Hotspur, still determined to win a trophy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:20:41+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:20</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino would have walked away from Tottenham if they had won the Champions League last season.</p>
      <p>Now the Argentine boss finds himself <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/breaking-mauricio-pochettino-sacked-tottenham-20917205">given his marching orders</a> less than six months later.</p>
      <p>Spurs defied the odds to reach the final in Europe’s elite club competition last term, memorably coming from behind to defeat Ajax in the semi-finals, only to eventually go down 2-0 to Premier League rivals <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in the final.</p>
      <p>Pochettino said in the build up to the Madrid showpiece that he could quit if they lifted the trophy.</p>
      <p>In the middle of pre-season, he doubled down on those comments.</p>

      <p>He said in July: "Of course it’s always in your head. You never know. With the way I am, I am always going to prioritise the club over myself.</p>
      <p>“Maybe if it was a different result after the final you can think, ‘OK, maybe this is a moment to leave the club and give them the possibility of a real new chapter with a new coaching staff.'</p>
      <p>"But after the final I felt this was not great to finish like this. I’m not a person that avoids facing problems or a difficult situation.</p>
      <p>“I am more on the [other] side: I love a massive challenge and of course now [we must] rebuild that mentality to make it possible to repeat a similar season. That is exciting and motivates me a lot."</p>

      <p>Four months later Pochettino finds himself out of work, with Spurs languishing down in 14th in the table.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> chief Daniel Levy said: "We were extremely reluctant to make this change.</p>
      <p>"It is not a decision the board has taken lightly, nor in haste. Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing."</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has been installed as the bookmakers’ favourite to replace Pochettino at the helm.</p>
      <p>Carlo Ancelotti, Massimiliano Allegri, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> ’s Brendan Rodgers and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> ’s Eddie Howe are also said to be in contention.</p>
      <p>Pochettino, linked with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> in the past year, may now regret his decision to remain.</p>
