      <h2>Radio 1's Greg James was told off by Prince Willliam and Kate Middleton for a joke he made about Princess Charlotte</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:33:54+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:33</time> by <a rel="author">Ashleigh Rainbird, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/ashleigh-rainbird/</a></address>
      <p>BBC Radio 1’s <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/greg-james">Greg James</a> got a royal ticking off from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge after mocking Princess Charlotte’s first day at school.</p>
      <p>Prince Wills and Kate were (unfortunately) tuned into the Breakfast Show after Princess Charlotte shook hands with her new teacher at Thomas’s school in South London.</p>
      <p>Greg had a laugh about it on air – and the royals were not amused... “They were listening on the morning Charlotte went to school,” recalls Greg.</p>
      <p>“I saw the photo during the show and said, ‘Who the hell shakes hands with their teacher on the first day?’.”</p>

      <p>A few weeks later, Greg and Radio 1’s Teen Heroes went to Kensington Palace to meet the royals, who had a quiet word with him.</p>
      <p>He says: "They said: ‘We were listening on the morning of little Charlotte’s first day, and we want to talk to you about the handshaking thing...’</p>
      <p>“I went: ‘Oh God, no!’</p>

      <p>“They’d heard me saying this school was so posh they had to shake hands with their teacher every day.</p>
      <p>"They were not like that in my day.</p>
      <p>“You were pleased if you got a smile.</p>
      <p>"I’m sure it’s all absolutely fine,” he adds, hopefully.</p>
