      <h1>We've Got Bad News About The Porsche Taycan</h1>
      <h2>Porsche's electric car may not arrive when we expected.</h2>

      <p>Delays are nothing new in the world of EVs. The long-promised $35,000 base <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/model-3">Tesla Model 3</a> suffered numerous <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/tesla-model-3-delays-continue-and-no-one-is-surprised">production and delivery delays</a>, prompting customers to <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/customers-cancel-tesla-model-3-reservations-due-to-delays">cancel their orders</a>. Tesla isn't the only automaker plagued with these issues, however.</p>
      <p>The launch of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/audi/e-tron-suv">Audi e-tron</a> was pushed back due to software issues, and the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/jaguar/i-pace">Jaguar I-Pace</a> arrived several months later than expected for some customers. And now, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/porsche/taycan">Porsche Taycan</a> is the latest hotly anticipated electric car to suffer a significant delay.</p>

      <p>Originally, deliveries of the Porsche Taycan were slated to start in January 2020. However, as reported by <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/383171/porsche-taycan-delivery-delay/">InsideEVs</a>, a post on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/taycanporsche/?ref=group_header">Porsche Taycan Facebook Group</a> reveals that Porsche's first-ever electric car has been delayed by eight to ten weeks due to the "complexity surrounding the production."</p>
      <p>Here's the translated email a Norwegian reservation holder received from Porsche: "Taycan is our first fully electric sports car. The car is developed from scratch and manufactured in a brand new factory. All Porsche employees have worked with full pressure to start delivering Taycan as scheduled in January. Still, as a result of the enormous complexity surrounding the production of Taycan, we must report that unfortunately the delivery dates are somewhat delayed."</p>

      <p>"We currently expect delays of around eight to ten weeks, and a new production time for your car will be communicated through your seller as soon as this is ready. We strongly apologize and guarantee that we will do everything we can to deliver your Porsche Taycan as soon as possible."</p>
      <p>Demand for the Taycan has been significant, so the delay is probably a wise move to prevent any teething issues. Before the Taycan had even been unveiled, Porsche had already <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/porsche-taycan-is-already-proving-to-be-a-smash-hit">secured nearly 30,000 deposits for the electric sedan</a>. Pricing starts at <b>$103,800</b> for the entry-level Taycan 4S, <b>$153,310</b> for the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/porsche/taycan-turbo">Taycan Turbo</a> and <b>$187,610</b> for the range-topping Turbo S, which uses two electric motors to produce 750 horsepower and 774 lb-ft of torque.</p>
