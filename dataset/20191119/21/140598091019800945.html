      <h1>Striking lecturers' pensions worth three times private sector average, say Vice Chancellors</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:05:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/camilla-turner/" target="_blank">Camilla Turner</a></address>
      <p>Lecturers have been told that their pension schemes are some of the best in the country and three times the private sector average ahead of planned strike action this month.</p>
      <p>Universities UK (UUK), which represents vice-Chancellors, and Universities and Colleges Employers Association have written a joint letter to staff, urging them to call off eight days of industrial action which is due to begin on Monday.</p>
      <p>Over a million students face disruption as academics from 60 universities signed up to strike over their pay and pension.</p>
      <p>Members of the University and College Union (UCU) voted to back strike action in two ballots over pensions and pay and working conditions. Lecturers and other university staff will begin an eight day walk out on Monday.</p>
      <p>UCU has been locked in a battle with UUK over proposed pension reforms to address a reported deficit and rising benefit costs.</p>
      <p>The current dispute is over UCU members being forced to make increased contributions to maintain the same level of benefits. Employees are now paying in 9.6 per cent of their salary to the scheme rather than the 8 per cent they paid last year.</p>
      <p>In the open letter, university chiefs said: “USS is one of the very best pension schemes in the country, with average payments in retirement worth nearly three times the national average for private sector defined benefit schemes, and comparable to government backed public sector schemes.</p>
      <p>“This will not be affected by the changes resulting from the 2018 valuation and yet UCU have announced industrial action.”</p>
      <p>They called for “constructive dialogue” with UCU members ahead of Monday, adding that disrupting students’ degrees would be “deeply regrettable”.</p>
      <p>But UCU hit back, accusing them being insincere about their offer to return to the negotiating table, since their letter said that they “simply cannot afford to put more into this year’s pay increases than they already have”.</p>
      <p>Jo Grady, general secretary of UCU, said: “Universities’ refusal to talk about pay smacks of game playing, as they must know an offer like this creates real difficulties in trying to resolve that dispute.</p>
      <p>“Nobody wants to take strike action, but we need to be talking about all the elements if we are to solve all the problems.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, a vice-Chancellor broke ranks to argue that universities can afford to pay more into the pension scheme.</p>
      <p>Prof Anthony Forster of Essex University, said that trustees of the pension scheme were “being overly prudent in their assumptions, which undervalue assets and overestimate liabilities”.</p>
      <p>Last spring, lectures and classes were disrupted at more than 60 universities by 14 days of strikes across four weeks.</p>
      <p>At the time, the row centred on proposals that would change the Universities Superannuation Scheme from a "defined benefit" scheme, which gives workers a guaranteed income in their retirement, to a purely "defined contribution" scheme, in which pensions are subject to fluctuations in the stock market.  </p>
