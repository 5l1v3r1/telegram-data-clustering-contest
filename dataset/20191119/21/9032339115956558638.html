      <p>The roster of the world's royal babies includes more names than the familiar Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis, and Archie Mountbatten-Windsor. Hundreds of miles south of London, for example, adorable tots from Monaco's own royal family gathered (with grown-ups) in Monte Carlo for a regal balcony moment of their own.</p>
      <p>Among those included were four-year-old twins Princess Gabriella and Prince Jacques, children of the reigning Prince Albert II and his wife, Princess Charlene. Also in the pint-sized crowd was Kaia-Rose Wittstock, the daughter of Princess Charlene's brother Gareth Wittstock and his wife, Roisin Galvin.</p>
      <p>The list goes on. In fact, there are so many recent additions to Monaco's royal family that Prince Albert II jokes that they don't have enough room. "We're running out of space for everyone," he told <i><a href="https://people.com/royals/monacos-royal-twins-steal-the-spotlight-and-the-balcony-on-national-day-see-all-the-best-moments/">People</a></i>. "We're going to have to create new windows, build new balconies."</p>
      <p>Here, take a look at how Monaco's royals—of all ages—are celebrating their annual national holiday.</p>
