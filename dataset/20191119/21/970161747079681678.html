      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has said the monarchy ‘needs a bit of improvement’ after being asked on tonight’s ITV election debate if it was fit for purpose.</p>
      <p>However <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> said the monarchy was ‘beyond reproach’.</p>
      <p>It comes after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> gave what many labelled a ‘car crash interview’ to the BBC, as he denied having sex with Virginia Roberts when she was 17.</p>
      <p>He was also grilled on his links to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who died in prison earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Both Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson were taking part in the first leader’s debate before the general election on December 12.</p>
      <p>ITV’s Julie Etchingham then asked the party leaders if Prince Andrew was fit for purpose, to which Mr Corbyn said: ‘Before we discuss Prince Andrew I think we should discuss the victims that are there because of what (Jeffrey) Epstein was doing.</p>

      <p>‘I think there are very, very serious questions that must be answered and nobody should be above the law, but the primary position ought to be the proper treatment of those people who were victims of the most appalling behaviour by apparently Epstein and many others.’</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson said ‘all our sympathies’ should be with the victims of Epstein, adding: ‘The law must certainly take its course.’</p>
