      <p>It's a subject that has been the topic of substantial speculation over the years and Nadine Coyle has revealed why she no longer speaks to her Girls Aloud bandmates.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/who-is-nadine-coyle-age-17272048">Nadine</a> is one of the famous faces in the jungle for the new series of I'm A Celebrity but is of course best known for being part of the group who shot to fame on Popstars: The Rivals.</p>
      <p>They soared straight to the Christmas number 1 spot with debut single Sound of The Underground and hits including Love Machine, Jump, Call The Shot and The Promise swiftly followed before the girls decided to call it a day after their 2009 tour.</p>
      <p>They came back with greatest hits album and tour Ten in 2012/3, before announcing they were calling time on the band again.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/im-a-celebrity-nadine-cheryl-17281410">Cheryl has openly hit out at Nadine</a> for suggesting she and bandmates Kimberley, Nicola and Sarah were behind the split and on Tuesday night's I'm A Celebrity, the Irish singer was put on the spot by Kate Garraway about why she doesn't speak to them anymore.</p>
      <p>Nadine explained: “Everyone gets on with their lives, I was friends with them all, it was all nice and lovely.  But I was always in the gay bars with all the guys, I’d be out partying, me and 10 guys, I was having a laugh, I was 18-19 years old.”</p>
