      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:14:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-reporters/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/uk-general-election-2019-date/">general election will be held on Thursday Dec 12</a>.</p>
      <p>Here's everything you need to know about postal voting, including the deadline.</p>
      <h3>What is a postal vote?</h3>
      <p>In England, Scotland and Wales, you can choose to vote by post if you cannot or do not wish to attend your polling station in person.  Different arrangements for postal voting apply in Northern Ireland. See <a href="http://www.eoni.org.uk/">here for further details.</a></p>
      <h3>When do I need to return my postal vote by?</h3>
      <p>If you want to vote by post in the General Election, apply by 5pm on Nov 26 to receive your postal voting pack.</p>
      <p>Your postal vote must then arrive at your Electoral Office in the UK by 10pm on Dec 12, the day of the election. </p>
      <p>There’s a different form to <a href="http://www.eoni.org.uk/Vote/Voting-by-post-or-proxy">apply to vote by post in Northern Ireland</a>. Apply by 5pm on Nov 21.</p>

      <h3>What's the process?</h3>
      <p>Complete your ballot paper in secret, then put it in the envelope supplied and seal it tight.  </p>
      <p>You must also remember to fill in and sign the accompanying postal voting statement.</p>
      <p>Put both items into the larger envelope and post it back to your local electoral registration office. </p>
      <h3>Can I return my postal vote from abroad?</h3>
      <p>Yes. A postal vote can be sent to your home address, or any other address you provide. You just need to remember to allow enough time for it to be returned so it arrives back by 10pm on polling day otherwise your vote won't be counted.</p>
      <p>If you're posting your vote from overseas you'll need to pay for postage. Otherwise there's a Freepost envelope provided for returns within the UK.</p>

      <h3>What is a proxy vote?</h3>
