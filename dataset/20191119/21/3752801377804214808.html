      <p>Western Cape police have opened an inquest following the discovery of a decomposing body on a beach on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"Ocean View SAPS members attended to a complaint from a passer-by who was walking with his dogs when he found a body on the beach between Misty Cliffs and Soetwater," police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The brief statement came after News24 sent the police a video recording of the body that was captured by a man on the beach.</p>
      <p>"The body was dressed in a black wetsuit with flippers and was in an advanced state of decomposition," Van Wyk said.</p>
      <p>The body of the unknown male was taken to a nearby mortuary.</p>
