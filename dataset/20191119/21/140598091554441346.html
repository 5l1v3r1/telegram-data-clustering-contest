      <h1>Substitute jockey wins Lingfield race after answering last-minute call on Twitter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:32:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/marcus-armytage/" target="_blank">Marcus Armytage</a></address>
      <p>A jockey who answered an owner’s Twitter SOS to ride his horse at Lingfield ended up riding her first winner of the season on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Racheal Kneller was riding out in Lambourn when Vaughan Lewis, owner of Ruacana, put out a message for a jockey to partner his horse in the novelty annual handicap hurdle in which the rider is required to have a Flat jockey’s licence, after Trevor Whelan’s flight from Ireland had been cancelled.</p>
      <p>Until Kneller, 32, replied he had had no takers, partly because there were two all-weather Flat meetings yesterday and not all Flat jockeys are prepared to risk their necks over obstacles.</p>
      <p>“I came up through the Pony Club riding eventers and show-jumping and have a retired racehorse which I jump, so that wasn’t a worry,” she told <i>Telegraph Sport</i> last night. “But if I’d known I was going to ride in it I’d have had a practice over the weekend.”</p>
      <p>She added: “My agent said Ruacana had 11st 4lb and I thought, ‘Poor thing having to carry so much lead’ so I stopped at a McDonald’s and had a chocolate milkshake on the way. I thought that would help with a couple of pounds. Maybe I should do it more often!</p>

      <p>“Ironically I’ve been trying to get a ride in this race for years. The only person I didn’t ring for a ride beforehand took their horse out because they couldn’t find a jockey, so I was kicking myself.”</p>
      <p>Ruacana, trained by Zoe Davidson, went on to win by 10 lengths. “It was great fun,” said Kneller. “He was a schoolmaster and I was just a passenger. He was a superstar."</p>
