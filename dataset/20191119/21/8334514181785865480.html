      <p>MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Britain’s opposition Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, asked about Prince Andrew’s conduct, said on Tuesday there were serious questions to be answered.</p>
      <p>Andrew, Queen Elizabeth’s second son, denies an allegation that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl procured for him by his friend Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in a U.S. prison in August while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>“There are very, very serious questions that must be answered and nobody should be above the law,” Corbyn said during a televised debate with Prime Minister Boris Johnson.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the same subject, Johnson said: “All our sympathies should be with the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, and the law must certainly take its course.”</p>
