      <h1>US safety board chair criticises Uber for 2018 fatal self-driving crash</h1>
      <h2>The NTSB submitted draft findings in Sumwalt's written testimony Congress ahead of a Senate hearing Wednesday as a probable cause in the crash was ongoing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:48:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:48</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>The chairman of the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) offered a harsh critique of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uber-technologies">Uber Technologies </a>Inc's overall approach to safety in draft findings released on Tuesday of a fatal self-driving car crash in Arizona in March 2018.</p>
      <p>"The inappropriate actions of both the automatic driving system as implemented and the vehicle's human operator were symptoms of a deeper problem," NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said, citing the "ineffective safety culture that existed at the time of Uber."</p>
      <p>The NTSB submitted draft findings in Sumwalt's written testimony Congress ahead of a Senate hearing Wednesday as a probable cause in the crash was ongoing. Reuters reviewed the draft testimony.</p>
      <p>According to Sumwalt's draft testimony, the probable cause of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uber-crash">Uber crash </a>was the failure of the vehicle operator to monitor the driving environment "because she was visually distracted throughout the trip by her personal cell phone."</p>
      <p>Cited as contributing factors were Uber's inadequate safety risk-assessment procedures and ineffective oversight of the vehicle operator. The testimony said the findings were "subject to change pending the board's adoption of the final report."</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Uber's self-driving car effort, Sarah Abboud, did not comment immediately Tuesday, said before the hearing the company has "adopted critical program improvements to further prioritize safety."</p>
      <p>The testimony also cited the pedestrian's crossing outside a crosswalk and the Arizona Department of Transportation's insufficient oversight of autonomous vehicle testing.</p>
      <p>Sumwalt's testimony also said the board was recommending the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration require entities testing self-driving vehicles submit a safety self-assessment report to the agency and for the agency to determine if plans include appropriate safeguards.</p>
      <p>While Uber has made improvements, Sumwalt's testimony cited ongoing concerns about safety issues in the self-driving vehicle sector. "We remain concerned regarding the safety culture of the numerous other developers who are conducting similar testing," said.</p>
      <p>The NTSB's recommendations will likely reverberate across the industry. The Arizona crash was the first-ever death attributed to an autonomous vehicle and prompted significant safety concerns about the nascent self-driving car industry, which is working to get vehicles into commercial use.</p>
      <p>The crash killed 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg as she was walking a bicycle across a street at night in Tempe, Arizona.</p>
      <p>The NTSB previously disclosed that the Uber vehicle had significant software flaws, noting the software failed to properly identify Herzberg as a pedestrian and did not include a consideration for jaywalking pedestrians. Herzberg was not crossing at an intersection. Uber had also deactivated a Volvo automatic emergency braking system in the XC90 test vehicle it had modified.</p>
      <p>The NTSB said on Tuesday it planned to identify the need for "safety risk management requirements for testing automated vehicles on public roads," signalling a broader question about how advanced vehicles are tested and U.S. government oversight.</p>
      <p>In the aftermath of the crash, Uber suspended all testing of self-driving vehicle. It resumed testing last December in Pennsylvania with revised software and significant new restrictions and safeguards.</p>
      <p>In March, prosecutors in Arizona said Uber was not criminally liable in the self-driving crash. Police have investigated whether the safety driver who was behind the wheel and supposed to respond in the event of an emergency should face criminal charges.</p>
      <p>Police have said the crash was "entirely avoidable" and that the backup driver was watching "The Voice" TV program at the time of the crash.</p>
      <p>The NTSB said Uber failed to adequately monitor backup safety drivers and lacked other significant safety rules.</p>
