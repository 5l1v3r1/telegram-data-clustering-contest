      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/larsa-pippen">Larsa Pippen</a> shared another workout video of herself wearing a gorgeous blue sports bra and high waisted leggings. Previously, <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5750594/larsa-pippen-figure-bra/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a> reported that the <i>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</i> star wore the outfit in a video featuring an arm workout. This time, a video showcased Pippen as she worked on her backside and her core.</p>
      <p>In the video, Pippen, 45, showed off her strength. The mother of four was strapped into a machine at the gym that allowed her to do barbell pelvic thrusts. She wore black weight gloves on hands that showed off her light manicured fingernails. The position showed off the reality TV star’s toned arms and shoulders as well as a hint of sideboob and cleavage. Pippen, who is the ex-wife of former NBA star Scottie Pippen, held onto the top of the weight bench, and she braced her feet against the footplate, and she slowed lifted and lowered her hips several times while controlling her breathing. As she fully extended, Pippen’s flat stomach took center stage. In the background, an upbeat rap song played.</p>
      <p>The videographer started at Pippen’s head and slowly moved around, showing her working out from several different angles. In the background, various weight machines, a TV, workout equipment, and a small kitchenette were visible.</p>
