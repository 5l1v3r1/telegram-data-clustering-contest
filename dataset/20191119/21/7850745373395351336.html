      <p>‘The ghetto’ is not a geographical expression: it is a social demarcation, an embodiment of everything wrong about the way our society is being ruled. Ghettos are huge spaces of deprivation surrounding pockets of affluence. These spaces are socially constructed.</p>
      <p>It is only fair to say that after 33 years as head of state, taking pride as ‘man of ghetto’ is, perhaps unwittingly, to congratulate oneself for perpetuating ghetto life.</p>
      <p>This aside, the ‘man of ghetto’ image, and the ensuing political ‘scramble for the ghetto’ as many continue to call it, speaks to something bigger, one that should worry all of us.</p>
      <p>Anyone following contemporary politics in Uganda would tell you that President Museveni’s regime has perfected the purpose for which the colonial state instituted the army and other security organs. In the view of this regime, militarization is the final solution to all social issues.</p>
      <p>When NAADS faced challenges, soldiers were rushed in as new managers. Even the so-called ‘wealth creation’ is now the business of the army.</p>
      <p>The military option cannot be saved even for unarmed university students demanding limits to the neo-liberal onslaught on public institutions! Behind the facade of remembering ghetto people politically, therefore, is a sinister move to draw ghetto people into the realm of state control.</p>
      <p>It is very unlikely that the ghetto peoples’ overwhelming support to President Museveni’s unusual challenger, Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, will be exempted from the usual criminalization of support to the president’s political opponents.</p>
      <p>That is why in the ongoing buildup to the 2021 presidential elections, ghetto people must prepare not only for yellow envelopes and handouts, but most importantly for floods of armed men and women whose official mission will be to put down the simplest of ghetto dissent.</p>

        <b>Mr President, solve Rwanda-Uganda impasse</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mr President, your recent Luanda effort to address the political stand-off between Uganda and Rwanda, which culminated in an MOU, is very much commendable.</p>
      <p>Although in August, together with your counterparts, you decided to expeditiously settle any difference between Uganda and Rwanda through “peaceful means, conventional channels and in the spirit of the African brotherhood and solidarity”, almost three months down the road nothing substantial has been done.</p>
      <p>Your Excellency, as a matter of fact, it is nearly nine months since the diplomatic/political impasse between Uganda and Rwanda occurred, which forced Rwanda to close its borders and thus tremendously affecting commerce and trade between the two countries, a situation which has resulted in losses to traders in both countries and obviously negatively affected the economies of the two countries and compromised the livelihoods of the people.</p>
      <p>The continued border closure has serious security implications. You may recall that a few months ago, two smugglers (one Rwandan and the other Ugandan) were gunned down by Rwandan security officers allegedly for trying to fight the security officers.</p>
      <p>Last week two Ugandans were also gunned down by the Rwandan security officers over the same grounds. A panelist from Kisoro district while on the media roundtable broadcasted by NBS TV this Friday, November 15 claimed that smuggling was on the increase along the Uganda-Rwanda border.</p>
      <p>Your Excellency, this should by no means be treated lightly, for it has great potential to ignite a bloody conflict between Uganda and Rwanda in the event that the killings are repeated.  </p>
      <p>Mr President, the Uganda—Rwanda ties are inseparable. The two societies are symbiotically connected that any degree of misunderstanding or difference has serious damaging social and economic effects on the two societies. For instance, think of the devastating pain of not being able to bury your own child or parent just because of the misunderstanding between the two countries!</p>
      <p>Your Excellency, while the quiet diplomacy you have assured the nation that you are engaged in to seek a diplomatic solution to the differences between Uganda and Rwanda is important, what is even more critical to reassure and raise the crushed hopes of Ugandans and Rwandans experiencing the dire conditions resulting from the border closure is by engaging in open diplomacy, which has a more direct role of appealing to the confidence and hope of the affected people.  </p>

        <b>Political amateurs are Uganda’s enemies</b>
      </p>
      <p>Political amateurs like Bobi Wine, not Museveni, are Uganda’s real enemy. Bobi Wine is a political amateur compared to Museveni.</p>
      <p>President Museveni is still by far the best option for Uganda. Many Ugandans think what we need now is to cast the National Resistance Movement government out and infuse a new political leadership with young blood.</p>
      <p>This might sound like good news to a particular group but it’s dangerous. The emergence of many political amateurs poses a very big threat to our democracy and development.</p>
      <p>People who know more about politics like President Museveni are more likely to embrace democratic values such as political tolerance. However, the young group doesn’t welcome open criticism as well. Again, it’s good to have leaders who have a wide knowledge on policy, and legislative procedures.</p>

        <b>Africa should learn from China</b>
      </p>
      <p>For quite some time I have been trying to compare my country Uganda and our close friend China. I see a lot that has been achieved through our partnerships and I see a lot more is still in the offing for us to gain from in the friendship between the two countries.</p>
      <p>On my trip to China a few weeks ago, I really admired whatever step China has reached and I salute the leaders of the great Communist party who have tirelessly made sure that all their development plans have been achieved.</p>
      <p>China’s sustained high economic growth and increased competitiveness in manufacturing has been underpinned by a massive development of physical infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Infrastructural development has greatly played an important role in promoting economic growth. My experience from China suggests that it is necessary to design an economic policy that improves the physical infrastructure as well as human capital formation for sustainable economic growth in developing countries.</p>
      <p>I am very sure that this China-Africa relationship will make a way for many African countries to develop their infrastructures like roads, bridges and the other ones that are of great importance to the various countries.</p>
