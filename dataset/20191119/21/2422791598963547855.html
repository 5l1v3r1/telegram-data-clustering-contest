      <h1>Toxic algae, climate change, bad policy: Scientists say fresh water under threat</h1>

      <p>HAMILTON -- Canada will be up a creek without a paddle if it doesn't acknowledge threats to its fresh water, says a report from some of the country's top water scientists.</p>
      <p>"We've enjoyed the luxury of the myth of limitless abundance of fresh water in Canada," said Bob Sandford, a co-author of <a href="https://gwf.usask.ca/articles/2019/canada-falling-short-of-u.n.s-sustainable-development-goals-new-report-from-water-scientists.php">a report by the Global Water Futures project, </a>which involves 22 universities.</p>
      <p>"Canada is not a water-secure country."</p>
      <p>Climate change is rapidly outpacing water use policies that haven't changed in decades and the patchwork of rival jurisdictions that create them aren't moving quickly enough to adapt, said co-author Corinne Schuster-Wallace.</p>
      <p>"Climate change impacts are accelerating far faster than we ever thought they would. Our water governance policies are fragmented."</p>
      <p>As an example, the authors point to eutrophication, a poisoning of lake water by toxic algae that often affects lakes such as Lake Erie and Lake Winnipeg.</p>
      <p>The algae have always been around, but the impacts are increasing from growing amounts of agricultural run-off and the gradual warming of lake water from climate change.</p>
      <p>"Lakes in Canada are warming at twice the global rate," Sandford said. "Warmer water reduces the threshold it takes ... to produce algal blooms.</p>
      <p>"Eutrophication is a problem from coast to coast to coast."</p>
      <p>Changing weather patterns also threaten farms. More precipitation is falling as rain instead of snow, which runs off instead of staying on the land.</p>
      <p>"Prairie agriculture depends on that snowpack," Schuster-Wallace said.</p>
      <p>Cities are threatened too, as glaciers -- the water tanks of the Prairies -- melt away.</p>
      <p>"When you think of our glaciers as our savings account and not our checking account, that's a real problem," said Schuster-Wallace. "Our checking account's looking really flush at the moment. But in 10, 20, 30 years time, our savings account will be gone."</p>
      <p>Some watersheds are already overdrawn. Sandford said the South Saskatchewan River, which waters a large stretch of southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, is now over-allocated.</p>
      <p>Overall, water quality is slowly degrading. While 112 of 175 Canadian river monitors showed good or excellent water quality, the changes that have appeared show more declines than improvements.</p>
      <p>Little is known about many watersheds.</p>
      <p>Quality data only exists for 67 of 167 sub-watersheds in Canada. Of those, almost two-thirds are rated fair or poor.</p>
      <p>And climate change continues to increase the number of precipitation-based extreme weather events such as floods, damaging homes and other infrastructure.</p>
      <p>"We've had three one-in-a-hundred-year events in five years," Schuster-Wallace said.</p>
      <p>The Parliamentary Budget Officer says natural disaster relief costs have increased by 660 per cent between 1970 and 2014. The cost from extreme events between 2000 and 2017 exceeds $28 billion.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, water is governed by agreements which, in some cases, were drafted in the 1960s. In a dry year, Alberta would already be hard pressed to leave Saskatchewan its share of the water in some rivers, Sandford said.</p>
      <p>"Divisiveness in and of itself in this country could cost us a great deal," he said.</p>
      <p>"The pan-Canadian climate strategy is in a shambles. There's tremendous disputes and we're not getting to solutions."</p>
      <p>Both authors urged politicians to tone down their rhetoric and get to work.</p>
      <p>"We have to commit to changing what we do and how we do it," Schuster-Wallace said. "And we need to have done that yesterday."</p>
