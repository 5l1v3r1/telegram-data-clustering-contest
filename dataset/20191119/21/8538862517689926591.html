      <p>Sony released <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/11/playstations_new_ps4_ad_invites_kratos_crash_and_cloud_into_our_world">another cool TV advert</a> just over two weeks ago, but upon closer inspection, the PlayStation community reckons the hardware manufacturer has buried a tease for a new Crash Bandicoot game within the 60 seconds of footage. We're not entirely convinced, but the video above is timed to show you the supposed hint in question.</p>
      <p>Did you catch it? At exactly 11 seconds in, you'll get a glimpse of Crash racing about a car park. He is joined by an Aku Aku mask, and another which accompanies Coco Bandicoot that has never been seen in any Crash game past or present.</p>
      <p>Character artist Nicholas Kole at developer Toys for Bob, who worked on both the <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/crash_bandicoot_n_sane_trilogy">Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</a> and <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/spyro_reignited_trilogy">Spyro: Reignited Trilogy</a>, acknowledged the mask on <a href="https://twitter.com/FromHappyRock/status/1191410102470877185">Twitter with a thinking emoji</a>, adding fuel to the fire burning under a rumoured Crash Bandicoot Worlds. It's the first we've heard of such a title, but the existence of this all-new mask is certainly interesting indeed.</p>
