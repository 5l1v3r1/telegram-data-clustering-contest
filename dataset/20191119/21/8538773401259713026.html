      <p>TORONTO -- The term "midget" is being dropped from youth divisions in Canadian hockey because the governing body aims to be more inclusive.</p>
      <p>Hockey Canada says it wanted to be sure it wasn't "putting up barriers to keep people away from the sport." The term "midget" has long been used in a variety of sports although it is considered derogatory by many.</p>
      <p>The issue generated attention a year ago when the parent of a young son with dwarfism noticed the term on a banner at a mall.</p>
      <p>Also dropped starting next season are the categories novice, peewee, bantam and atom. They will be replaced with age-based designators. The change was approved at Hockey Canada's winter congress over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The International Ice Hockey Federation and USA Hockey already use age designators for their divisions.</p>
