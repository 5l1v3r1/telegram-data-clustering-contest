      <h1>Odell Beckham Reveals What He Said To Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:08:50+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Odell Beckham Jr. had fans buzzing last Thursday when he made a yawning gesture toward Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin. After the dust settled from all the drama involving Myles Garrett, the All-Pro wideout revealed what he said on <i>Thursday Night Football</i>.</p>
      <p>When the Browns acquired Beckham in the offseason, Tomlin was asked about how his team will handle defending him. He jokingly yawned because it’s not the first time that he’s faced an elite playmaker.</p>
      <p>Clearly, the former first-round pick didn’t forget what Tomlin did.</p>
      <p>Beckham was caught patting his mouth multiple times during Thursday’s showdown between the Browns and Steelers.</p>
      <p>When asked about why he taunted Tomlin last week, Beckham said he did it because he felt disrespected.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2019/11/odell-beckham-jr-tells-mike-tomlin-you-disrespected-me-with-the-yawn-but-then-he-put-the-story-to-bed.html">cleveland.com:</a></p>
      <blockquote>“I said ‘you disrespected me,’” Beckham told cleveland.com on Monday. “I said ‘you know who I am.’ And he said ‘I know who you are. That’s why we’re doubling you all game’ and this and that.’’</blockquote>
      <p>Beckham did mention that he doesn’t have an issue with Tomlin. His actions were simply a form of trash talking.</p>
      <p>We’ll get to see Beckham in action against the Steelers in two weeks from now. Last time around he finished with four receptions for 60 yards.</p>
