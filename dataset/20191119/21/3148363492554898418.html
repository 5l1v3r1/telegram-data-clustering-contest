      <h1>Jerry Jones: A Lot of Kaepernick's Workout 'Wasn't About Football'</h1>
      <h2>Jerry Jones and the Cowboys were not represented at the Atlanta high school where Colin Kaepernick performed his workout on Saturday, but Jones seems unapologetic over the absence.</h2>

      <p>The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback abruptly canceled the workout session the NFL scheduled on Saturday and moved his workout to a local high school. Because of the short notice about the change, many teams did not send representatives to Kaepernick’s session.</p>
      <p>Jones did not send a representative to the school to observe. It also seems that Jones did not feel that Kaepernick was serious about working to rejoin the league, according to <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/11/19/jerry-jones-a-lot-of-kaepernick-workout-wasnt-about-football-from-the-start/">Pro Football talk</a>.</p>
      <p>“I think that it’s unfortunate you can’t just zero in on the business at hand and that’s evaluating a player that might or might not help you win football games or move the chains within a football game,” Jones <a href="https://twitter.com/toddarcher/status/1196804915005468672">told</a> ESPN. “That situation probably from the get-go had a lot more that wasn’t about football involved in it and consequently we got the result of that dynamic.”</p>
      <p>It appears that Jones never believed Kaepernick was serious about rejoining the NFL in the first place.</p>
      <p>Jones has famously been one of the few NFL owners who staunchly opposed the protest movement that Kaepernick spawned in 2016 when he first began taking a knee during the national anthem. He was later <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2018/07/27/cowboys-players-back-jerry-jones-on-standing-for-the-anthem/">backed up</a> by his players for his stance against the protests.</p>
