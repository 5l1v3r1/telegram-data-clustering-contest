      <p>During an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, Senator John Kennedy (R-LA) said that the impeachment hearings look like the hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh “without the vagina hats.”</p>
      <p>Kennedy said, “Well, you know what these proceedings look to me like right now? They look like the Kavanaugh hearing without the vagina hats. These are — this is going to be the most partisan — no, strike that, this will be the only partisan impeachment proceeding in the history of the United States. And all Speaker Pelosi and her team are doing is weaponizing impeachment as a political weapon.”</p>
