      <p>Hong Kong schools have reopened after a six-day shutdown but students were facing transit disruptions as the last protesters remained holed up on a university campus.</p>
      <p>City officials tried to restore a sense of normalcy as primary and secondary schools reopened Wednesday.</p>
      <p>There were scattered incidents of protesters stopping trains and blocking traffic but on a much smaller scale than the past disruptions.</p>
      <p>Some train stations remained shut, and city workers were inspecting damage to a main road tunnel that is closed after protesters torched the toll booths.</p>
      <p>A small group of protesters wonâ€™t leave Hong Kong Polytechnic University because they would face arrest. They are holdouts from hundreds who took over the campus for days.</p>
