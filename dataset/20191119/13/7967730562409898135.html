      <p>A portfolio of apartment blocks held by family interests associated with high-profile criminal lawyer Robert Richter, QC, has sold for more than $25 million.</p>

      <p>The seven apartment blocks around Melbourne and a commercial property in Northcote – owned by Mr Richter’s mother, other family members and associates – were auctioned over three days last week to individual investors and syndicates.</p>
      <p>The stand-alone apartment buildings in Ascot Vale, Essendon, Fawkner, Glenroy, Box Hill and Chadstone and a prominent warehouse on the crest of Rucker’s Hill in Northcote leased to Danish secondhand furniture firm Grandfather’s Axe, fetched a combined $25,311,000.</p>
      <p>Nearly 50 people gathered in Box Hill for the auctions of 8 James Street and 499 Station Street – although at least 10 of the crowd were members of the family selling the properties.</p>
      <p>When the bidding for 8 James Street reached $6.66 million, a nervous giggle rippled through the crowd, proving even Europeans have numerological superstitions.</p>
      <p>However, the buyer held no superstitions about the number 666 and auctioneer Paul Tzamalis' hammer came down at that point.</p>
      <p>The auction for the smaller Station Street property followed and took 112 bids, most of them for $1000 increments, to sell for $1.701 million.</p>
      <p>The large warehouse occupied by Grandfather’s Axe changed hands for $3,215,000 on 4 per cent yield.</p>
      <p>The property is zoned industrial 3, an anomaly as neighbouring properties in the area are covered by a commercial 1 zone which allows a greater variety of uses.</p>
      <p>Vinci Carbone selling agent Stephen Speck said the buyer purchased it as a “long-term play” and would look to get the property rezoned in the future.</p>
      <p>The apartment buildings attracted a diverse range of bidders from real estate agents, to builders and syndicates, and averaged a yield of 3.6 per cent on gross rent, Mr Speck said.</p>
      <p>“Everybody wanted income-generating assets,” he said.</p>
      <p>The properties were amassed by Mr Richter’s father and uncle, along with another business partner, who constructed the apartments over a decade between 1976 and 1986 and had since been held by various family members and associates under different individual or company structures.</p>
