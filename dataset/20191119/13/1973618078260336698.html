      <p>Christmas Day is a highly anticipated event every year, and for many the Advent calendar is the ultimate countdown tool. Generally outfitted with 24 numerically marked "windows," which can be popped open to reveal a prize, picture or words of scripture, Advent calendars have exploded in popularity in recent years. So, where did they come from and where are they going?</p>
      <h4>What Is Advent?</h4>
      <p>The word "Advent" (from the Latin word <i>Adventus</i>) means "coming." Originally, there wasn't much of a connection between Advent and Christmas. The period of Advent was <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/first-sunday-advent">started in the fifth century</a> as a six-week time of fasting, tied to the imminent baptism of new Christians on the Feast of the Epiphany on Jan. 6. That feast celebrates, among other things, the visit of the Magi to the infant Jesus. Sixth-century Romans revised Advent to be a time of focusing on the "second coming of Christ." (Christians believe Jesus will return to Earth at the end of time.)</p>
      <p>In the Middle Ages, the <a href="https://www.christianity.com/christian-life/christmas/what-is-advent.html">emphasis of Advent changed yet again</a>, to a period of penance and preparation for the "first coming" (or birth) of Jesus Christ before the feasting of Christmas Day, rather like the period of Lent before Easter.</p>

      <h4>When Is Advent?</h4>
      <p>Advent begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas, which means the date can change each year. It can start as early as <a href="https://www.christianity.com/christian-life/christmas/what-is-advent.html">Nov. 27 and as late as Dec. 3</a>. Liturgical churches will light a special candle each week during Advent and have special Bible readings. Families may make an <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-an-Advent-Wreath-for-Your-Family/">Advent wreath</a> or use an Advent calendar to mark the days.</p>
      <h4>History of the Advent Calendar</h4>
      <p>While the celebration of Advent is old, the associated calendars are a relatively new custom invented sometime in the <a href="https://sellmer-verlag.de/history.htm">19th century</a>. At first, these calendars were little more than a chalk line representing every day in December leading up to Christmas Eve, often on the back of a door. The first special Advent calendar was either produced by a <a href="https://www.ool.co.uk/blog/the-history-of-the-advent-calendar/">Protestant bookstore owner in 1902</a>, or else in the late 19th century by the mother of a German named <a href="https://sellmer-verlag.de/history.htm">Gerhard Lang</a>. Lang's mother stuck 24 sweets on a square of cardboard, one for her young son to eat each day before Christmas.</p>
      <p>As an adult, Lang opened a printing office and produced a calendar similar to the one his mother had made for him, with a colored picture for each day of the month. A few years later, he hit on the idea of adding 24 little "doors" that hid the picture for each day, giving the calendar an air of surprise.</p>
      <p>In the 1930s, due to cardboard rationing, Lang had to fold his business. However, after the end of World War II, other companies started making their own Advent calendars. The first one filled with tiny chocolates debuted in 1958, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/qi/10497094/QI-some-quite-interesting-facts-about-Advent.html?awc=15609_1574107668_680e82512edc374cb8f1f2d1db3c962e&amp;WT.mc_id=tmgoff_poth-inbaff_tra_hotels&amp;utm_source=78888&amp;utm_medium=AWIN&amp;utm_content=tra_hotels&amp;utm_campaign=www.skimlinks.com">courtesy of Cadbury</a>. Traditionally, the calendar didn't have a "door" for Christmas Day, but some newer ones have added a 25th door so the consumer has something to look forward to on Dec. 25.</p>
