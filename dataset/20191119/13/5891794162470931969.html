      <p>A Swedish prosecutor says she will not proceed with a preliminary investigation into an allegation of rape against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.<br/><br/>Sweden's Deputy Chief Prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson made the announcement on November 19, telling reporters that "the evidence is not strong enough to file an indictment."<br/><br/>The decision comes after a Swedish court ruled in June that the 48-year-old Australian should not be detained.<br/><br/>Assange, who is currently being held at a London prison, has denied the allegation made against him in 2010.<br/><br/>He has avoided extradition to Sweden for seven years after seeking refuge at Ecuadorâ€™s embassy in London in 2012.<br/><br/>He was evicted last month and sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for breaching his bail conditions.<br/><br/>Assange is also fighting extradition to the United States, where he is accused of scheming with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to break a password for a classified government computer.</p>
