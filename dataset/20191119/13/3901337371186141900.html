      <p>Spain have officially announced the sacking of their current boss and the rehiring of former manager Luis Enrique.</p>

      <p>Robert Moreno had been in charge of La Furia Roja since Luis Enrique stepped down from his role following the sad passing of his daughter in June 2019.</p>

      <p>However, Spain, via their official Twitter account, have now confirmed that Enrique has taken over from Moreno, who told his players after their victory over Romania on Monday night that he would not be given the job permanently. </p>
      <p>According to <i>Marca</i>, the players were left speechless and in tears after Moreno had let them know the latest. </p>

      <p>Spain faced a similar tumultuous coaching situation ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, when then coach Julen Lopetegui, who had guided his side unbeaten through qualification, was sacked on the eve of the tournament.</p>
