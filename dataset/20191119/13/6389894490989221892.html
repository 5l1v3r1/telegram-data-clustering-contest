      <p>Swedish prosecutors have dropped their investigation into an alleged rape by Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.</p>
      <p>The Swedish Prosecution Authority said: “The reason for this decision is that the evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed since the events in question.”</p>
      <p>The investigation relates to an alleged rape committed in 2010. The probe had been shelved but was reopened after Assange left the Ecuadorian embassy in the summer.</p>
      <p>Assange has always denied the allegation.</p>
