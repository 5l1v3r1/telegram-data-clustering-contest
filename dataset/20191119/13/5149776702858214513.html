      <p>Everton have been linked with a move for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> defender Matty Cash in recent days.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has been in fine form for the Reds this season, being rated as the best right back in the division.</p>
      <p>Cash has reportedly caught the eye of Everton talent spotters who have been impressed with his versatility as both a midfielder and full back.</p>

      <p>Along with Everton - Southampton and Crystal Palace have also been credited with an interest in the Forest academy graduate, who has a contract at the City Ground up until 2021.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10359744/everton-nottingham-forest-matty-cash-january/">Reports in the national press</a> have suggested that the Toffees could be willing to part with £12m to acquire Cash's services in the upcoming window.</p>
      <p>Forest legend Kenny Burns told NottinghamshireLive that a bid of that amount must be seriously considered by the board.</p>

      <p>In his <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-transfer-news-cash-3549393">weekly column,</a> Burns said: "While it might just be speculation, when you’re talking about the money that’s been reported, it would be really tough to turn that down.</p>
      <p>"The fact of the matter at clubs like Forest that don’t benefit from the Premier League riches is that to remain competitive and stay within Financial Fair Play rules, you have to sell players.</p>
      <p>"Granted, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-transfer-news-cash-3540965">£12m would seem to be a lot of money</a>, but we all know there’s a premium attached to young British players and at the age of 22, Cash still has the prime of his career to come."</p>
      <p>Well the Forest faithful believe, in contrast to Burns, that £12m shouldn't be enough to tempt decision makers to cash in (sorry!) on one of their most prized assets.</p>
      <p>We have given fans the opportunity to put their value on him and at the time of writing, the average response was £16m - a full £4m on top of the fee quoted in recent reports.</p>
