      <h1>Lord of the Rings series lands early season two renewal at Amazon</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:31:19+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Amazon Studios has handed out a second season order to its highly-ambitious Lord of the Rings series.</p>
      <p>The order comes at a time when the show is just starting pre-production on its first season in New Zealand, reported Deadline.</p>
      <p>The studio had announced Patrick McKay and JD Payne as the showrunner last year. They were joined by Bryan Cogman, who worked as a writer and co-executive producer on Game of Thrones, as a series consultant.</p>
      <p>Jurrasic World: Fallen Kingdom helmer JA Bayona is directing the first two episodes of the show. He is serving as executive producer alongside partner Belen Atienza.</p>
      <p>So far, actors Markella Kavenagh, Will Poulter, and Joseph Mawle have been cast in the show. More stars are expected to join them in coming months.</p>
      <p>The studio has made a multi-season production commitment to the TV series. It will produce the show in cooperation with the Estate of J R R Tolkien, publishing house HarperCollins, and New Line Cinema, a division of Warner Bros.</p>
      <p>However, the series will not be a retelling of Peter Jacksonâ€™s Oscar-winning trilogy. It will explore story set before the events in the first LOTR novel, The Fellowship of the Ring.</p>
