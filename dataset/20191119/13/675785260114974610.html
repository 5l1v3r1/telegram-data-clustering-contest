      <h1>Patrick Kluivert claims ex-Man Utd target Matthijs de Ligt 'regrets' Juventus transfer</h1>
      <h2>Man Utd and Barcelona both chased Matthijs de Ligt before he joined Juventus but a Catalan chief reckons he made the wrong call</h2>

      <p>Patrick Kluivert, Barcelona's academy director, reckons Matthijs de Ligt regrets shunning the Spanish giants in favour of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> in the summer.</p>
      <p>The Dutch defender had a host of Europe's biggest clubs chasing his signature with PSG and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> also vying for his services.</p>
      <p>De Ligt's compatriot and team-mate at Ajax Frenkie De Jong headed to the Nou Camp, but he chose not to follow and opted for Juventus instead.</p>
      <p>This term he has made 11 appearances for the Serie A champions but not been able to replicate the form he showed last season and Kluivert believes De Ligt accepts he made have may the wrong choice.</p>

      <p>"I didn't personally try to convince him about joining <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> ,' he told <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191119/471732492986/kluivert-creo-que-de-ligt-esta-un-poco-arrepentido-de-ir-a-la-juventus.html">Mundo Deportivo</a> .</p>
      <p>"I only told him about the positive aspects of Barcelona as a club and city.</p>
      <p>"We are obviously talking about a great defender and in the end he made a choice. I think he slightly regrets it now, but that's the way it is.</p>
      <p>"In life, you must make choices, sometimes good ones and sometimes bad. You have to learn from your decisions."</p>

      <p>De Ligt set Juventus back Â£67.8m with Barcelona refusing to offer the 20-year-old more money that De Jong.</p>
      <p>The Catalans were also reluctant to guarantee the defender first team football insisting he had to prove himself at the Nou Camp.</p>
      <p>Barcelona's defensive pair Gerard Pique and Clement Lenglet have both come in for criticism this term with Barcelona shipping 15 goals in 12 La Liga games.</p>
      <p>But they were not prepared to meet De Ligt's demands meaning he went elsewhere, but Kluivert maintains his compatriot must now live with the consequences.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman scored his first Juventus goal earlier this month when he got the winner against Torino to keep the Bianconeri top of the table.</p>
      <p>They have also qualified from their Champions League group with a game against Atletico Madrid next week to determine whether they finish top.</p>
