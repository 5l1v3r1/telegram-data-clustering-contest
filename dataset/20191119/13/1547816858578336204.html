        <b>Tiger Shroff is seen aping rumoured GF Disha Patani, during his work out session. The actor just like Disha flaunted his basic wear brand, as he sweats it out in the gym, to attain that sculpted body for his upcoming movie Baaghi 3</b>

      <p>Seems like these rumoured lovebirds are following in each other’s footsteps. Very often actress Disha Patani is seen flaunting her basic and sport wear brand she endorses in her several social media posts. Now following her is her rumoured BF and muscular actor Tiger Shroff. Just like his rumoured ladylove Disha, Tiger too flaunted his basic wear of the same brand, as he sweats it out in the gym, to attain that chiseled body, making his female fans drool over him.  </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The actor shared a picture on his social media handle, which clearly stated that the actor is following in his GF’s footsteps. On the picture, he wrote, “Time to Workk #baaghi3 #climax #da Y1.” Going by the picture, it seems that Tiger is preparing for the climax scene of the third instalment of Baaghi franchise. Seems like the actor has some major high octane sequences to perform in the upcoming days and hence does not want to leave any stone unturned. Tiger’s passion for fitness and dance was evident ever since his first movie and he continues to entertain the audience with the same.
