      <p>Close on the heels of removing encroachments along Pudukottai Road in the city, the Highways department on Tuesday launched an eviction drive to remove illegal strictures at Crawford.</p>
      <p>About 30 buildings, most of them residential dwellings, and some shops were removed with the help of three earthmovers.</p>
      <p>Highways department officials said the encroachers were issued notices over the past six months but were not heeding to directions to vacate.</p>
      <p>Even on Monday, a group of them made a representation at the public grievance meeting at the Collectorâ€™s Office seeking alternative arrangements.</p>
      <p>Removing the encroachments became imperative after widening of the road so as to shift about 20 electric poles that were now in the middle of the stretch.</p>
      <p>Tight security arrangements were made for the eviction drive.</p>
