      <p>A man has pleaded guilty to manslaughter following the death of a charity worker in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea">Swansea</a>.</p>
      <p>Mark Bloomfield died a few days after the alleged assault near the Full Moon pub in High Street on July 18.</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old had carried out charity work around the globe, including India and Africa, and had worked as a special assistant to Mother Teresa in Calcutta.</p>
      <p>Colin Thomas Payne, from Swansea, appeared in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea-crown-court">Swansea Crown Court</a> on Tuesday where he admitted the manslaughter of Mr Bloomfield as well as perverting the course of justice by removing CCTV footage from outside the pub.</p>
      <p>The 61-year-old denies a charge of murder and a trial date of December 2 was set.</p>
      <p>Judge Paul Thomas QC said: “For obvious reasons he can’t be sentenced until the trial has been concluded but in the meantime he will be remanded in custody."</p>
