      <h1>Regina Pats finally getting rewarded for their hard work</h1>
      <h2>The Regina Pats experienced a long-waited breakthrough Saturday with a 4-3 upset win over the East Division-leading Prince Albert Raiders.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:00:35+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/gregharderlp" target="_blank">Greg Harder</a></address>
      <p>Close is starting to count for the Regina Pats.</p>
      <p>The WHL’s cellar-dwellers have taken a meaningful step forward as of late by turning moral victories into something tangible, earning six points in their past six games.</p>
      <p>It culminated Saturday with a <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/regina-pats-score-huge-upset-win-over-prince-albert-raiders">huge 4-3 shootout win over the East Division-leading Prince Albert Raiders</a>. Regina (3-12-2-0) will look to carry that momentum into Tuesday’s game against the visiting Swift Current Broncos (4-11-1-2).</p>
      <p>“I hope this has a snowball effect and it turns into a winning streak,” said forward Ty Kolle, who scored two goals Saturday, including the shootout winner. “We just beat P.A. and they’re a top team. I think we’re going to have a lot of confidence going into this (next) game.”</p>
      <p>Prior to Saturday’s contest, the rebuilding Pats had one win and six losses in their previous seven games.</p>
      <p>However, two of those defeats were in overtime and five came by just a single goal, suggesting the team might be on the verge of a breakthrough.</p>
      <p>“Getting over the hump (against P.A.) is a big turning point for our team,” said forward Logan Nijhoff. “We’ve had a lot of tough bounces against us but we can’t really look at it like that. Bounces come your way when you’re working (hard) and you deserve it.”</p>
      <p>That’s what happened Saturday — versus the defending WHL champions, no less.</p>
      <p>“Obviously our record is nowhere near what it should be but, for where we’re at, I think we’re working hard and coming to the rink with a good attitude,” Nijhoff continued. “Things are bound to turn around (when you do that). Hopefully we can keep pushing with those extra efforts.”</p>
      <p>The Pats’ work ethic has put them in position to win a number of games this season, only to fall just a little short at the end. It looked like a here-we-go-again scenario on Saturday when Regina’s go-ahead goal late in the third period was overturned by a video review.</p>
      <p>Instead of coming unravelled, the team was able to persevere.</p>
      <p>“We’ve seen a lot of adversity so far this year; that’s just another piece of the puzzle,” Kolle noted. “Everybody was pretty dialled in after that. We all talked on the bench and just said ‘don’t let it get us down.’ The guys worked the hardest I’ve seen in a long time after that and it paid off.”</p>
      <p>No one was more relieved than head coach Dave Struch, who has seen far too many occasions this season where his players didn’t get rewarded for their efforts.</p>
      <p>That’s tough on morale.</p>
      <p>“It should be very frustrating and difficult to go through that process every day but our guys have stuck with it,” Struch said. “They should be commended for that. We’ve been relying on the momentum built from our work ethic and our practices and all of that stuff. We got a win (Saturday). This has to be a real big boost, a real big energy giver for us.”</p>
      <p>In Struch’s mind, they’ve earned it.</p>
      <p>“Our work ethic has been so consistent,” he added. “We make mistakes for sure but we play a good team game. Finishing a game off against good teams has been difficult for us. (On Saturday) our team played very resilient hockey. We fed off each other and we were rewarded with a win, which we feel we probably deserved more often than not.</p>
      <p>“We hope we can build off it moving forward.”</p>
