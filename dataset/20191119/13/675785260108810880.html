      <h1>I'm A Celeb stars' luxury items from make-up and pillow to that Jane McDonald pic</h1>
      <h2>The main campmates attempted to win luxury items for all the celebrities in the Put Your Oar In It challenge</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:48:54+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:48</time> by <a rel="author">Tiffany Wallis</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!</a> ended in disaster last night as most of the stars' luxury items ended up at the bottom of a swamp.</p>
      <p>The campmates from Croc Creek took part in the Put Your Oar In It challenge in a bid to get their hands on packages containing the celebrities' requested items.</p>
      <p>They all get to pick one thing to bring into camp with them to help them get through three weeks in the wilderness.</p>
      <p>However, the only way they could get hold of them was for the famous faces in the main camp to retrieve them from across over a pond - with nothing but oars to help them.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kate-garraway">Kate Garraway</a> , Roman Kemp, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/adele-roberts">Adele Roberts</a> , Nadine Coyle and Myles Stephenson had to secure each parcel from a pile and move it into a safe box across a pond using nothing but wooden oars.</p>

      <p>However, their balancing skills proved woefully inadequate with only two items making it back to camp.</p>
      <p>Kate Garraway was gifted her concealer and Adele Roberts returned with a framed photo of singer/telly star Jane McDonald.</p>
      <p>Here, are the luxury items that the other celebrities missed out on...</p>
      <h3>Nadine Coyle</h3>
      <p>After announcing that she wasn't too fussed about retrieving her luxury item -  a Tangle Teaser hairbrush - Nadine's item was used as a practise attempt.</p>
      <p>The parcel containing the hairbrush quickly fell into the swamp after the stars clashed oars just moments after starting the difficult challenge.</p>

      <h3>James Haskell</h3>
      <p>Sadly the Rugby star's orthopaedic pillow also never made it back to camp and slowly dunked under the swamp.</p>
      <p>GMB star Kate admitted she knew how important the pillow was to James and explained how he had damaged his neck playing rugby and the custom pillow helped the sportsman sleep.</p>
      <h3>Adele Roberts</h3>
      <p>Fans went into meltdown after the inside of Adele's package was revealed.</p>
      <p>She admitted she wanted to take a framed photo of Jane MacDonald into the jungle as she described her as a "legend".</p>
      <p>The radio presenter chose a picture of her favourite Loose Women star and encouraged everyone to give the photo a "lucky rub", after it was safely retrieved from the swamp challenge.</p>

      <h3>Roman Kemp</h3>
      <p>The Capital FM DJ revealed that his luxury item was a sentimental one and was a mug with a photo of his girlfriend and his dog on it.</p>
      <p>After watching his parcel sink into the water, Roman told viewers how the package "meant a lot to him".</p>
      <p>He said: "I've actually been missing home quite a lot already.</p>
      <p>"Seeing my luxury item go into the swamp is definitely one of the lowest moments I've had so far."</p>
      <h3>Myles Stephenson</h3>
      <p>The Rak-Su singer decided to take a disposable camera into camp, with hopes of capturing once-in-a-lifetime memories from his adventure Down Under.</p>
      <p>He explained the reasons behind his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/im-celeb-fans-hysterics-spot-20912049">unusual luxury item choice</a> : "Why not make a few memories in the jungle, you know?"</p>
      <p>Sadly, Myles' camera never made it across the oars.</p>

      <h3>Caitlyn Jenner</h3>
      <p>A-lister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> chose to take a luxury moisturiser cream into the jungle, however Croc Creek campmates failed to save it during the challenge.</p>
      <h3>Jacqueline Jossa</h3>
      <p>Campmates really felt the pressure as they tried to save a photo of Jacqueline's children during the challenge.</p>
      <p>Her little piece of home never made it to Snake Rock after falling in the swamp.</p>

      <h3>Kate Garraway</h3>
      <p>The other luxury item that made it back to camp was Kate Garraway's trusty concealer.</p>
      <p>The star appeared to feel guilty about her decision to bring the make-up essential into the jungle as she joked she would happily share it around with her fellow campmates.</p>
      <h3>Ian Wright</h3>
      <p>Roman took the blame for not saving 'hero' Ian's luxury item. He even joked: "I'm actually quite scared to ask what it was."</p>

      <p>While the comedian's luxury item was never revealed during the challenge, we can confirm his package sadly wasn't won.</p>
