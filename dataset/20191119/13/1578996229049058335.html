      <h1>Here's What You Need to Know About the 2020 Democratic Primary Debates</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:02:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:02</time> by <a rel="author">Madison Feller</a></address>
      <p>The 2020 presidential race is in full swing, and there's a mind-boggling number of Democratic primary candidates vying for the party's official spot. Luckily for voters, the debates are well on their way. Here, everything you need to know.</p>
      <h3>When is the November debate?</h3>
      <p>The fifth debate will be co-hosted by MSNBC and the <i>Washington Post </i>on November 20 in Atlanta at the Tyler Perry Studios. NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/nbc-news-first-democratic-debate-set-miami-june-26-27-n988481?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma">reported</a> that there will be a total of 12 debates during the Democratic primary season and that the first six are scheduled for 2019.</p>
      <p>The debate will be limited to two hours, airing from 9 to 11 P.M., and feature a group of all-women moderators: MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, NBC’s chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell, NBC News’ White House correspondent Kristen Welker, and <i>Post</i> White House reporter, Ashley Parker. This will be the second time a major political debate is moderated by all women, according to <i><a href="https://time.com/5730558/november-democratic-debate/">Time</a></i>.</p>
      <p>The sixth and final debate of 2019 <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/25/dnc-raises-thresholds-for-december-debate-000297">will be</a> hosted by PBS and Politico at UCLA on December 19.</p>
      <p>In case you missed any of the previous debates, here's a rundown: The first Democratic primary debates <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/first-democratic-presidential-debate-set-miami-s-arsht-center-host-n1004076">took place</a> on June 26 and June 27 in Miami, Florida. The second round of debates were <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/02/politics/cnn-2020-democratic-debate-july-detroit/index.html">hosted</a> by CNN in Detroit on July 30 and 31, and the third debate was hosted by ABC News in partnership with Univision on September 12 in Houston, Texas. The fourth debate was co-hosted by CNN and the <i>New York Times</i> on October 15 in Westerville, Ohio.</p>
      <h3>How can I watch it?</h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/do-you-have-question-2020-candidates-what-would-you-ask-n1068196">NBC</a>, the November debate will be available to watch live on MSNBC. It will also stream on MSNBC.com, NBCNews.com, and washingtonpost.com, as well as on the MSNBC, NBC News, and <i>The Washington Post</i>'s mobile apps.</p>
      <h3>What will the format be?</h3>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/democratic-primary-debates-2019-817339/">Rolling Stone</a></i> reports that the November debate will have four segments, and candidates will have 75 seconds to respond to questions and 45 seconds for rebuttals. They will not give opening statements, but they will have 75 seconds for closing arguments.</p>
      <p>NBC has also said it will be taking user-submitted questions for the evening. You can submit a question <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/do-you-have-question-2020-candidates-what-would-you-ask-n1068196">here</a>.</p>
      <h3>Is everyone debating?</h3>
      <p>Definitely not. For the first and second round debates, the Democratic National Committee <a href="https://democrats.org/press/dnc-announces-details-for-the-first-two-presidential-primary-debates/">announced</a> that candidates had two paths to qualifying:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>"Register 1% or more support in three polls (which may be national polls, or polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and/or Nevada) publicly released between January 1, 2019, and 14 days prior to the date of the Organization Debate." (Read more about the specific polling restrictions <a href="https://democrats.org/press/dnc-announces-details-for-the-first-two-presidential-primary-debates/">here</a>.)</li>
        <li>65,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 200 unique donors per state in at least 20 U.S. states.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>But after the first two debates, things got even trickier. To qualify for the third and fourth debates, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/29/politics/dnc-threshold-democratic-debates/index.html">candidates needed</a> to meet stricter requirements:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Register at least <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/silver-bulletpoints-whos-in-danger-of-missing-the-third-debate/">2% support</a> in four qualifying polls released between June 28 and August 28</li>
        <li>130,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 400 unique donors per state in at least 20 U.S. states.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The DNC then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/democratic-debate-lineup.html">raised the requirements</a> for qualifying for the November debates. Candidates needed to meet these to appear onstage:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Hit at least 3% support in four approved national surveys or early-state polls, or hit at least 5% support in two approved early-state polls</li>
        <li>Have 165,000 unique donors with at least 600 donors from at least 20 states.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>And if they'd like to appear on stage for the December debates, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/25/dnc-raises-thresholds-for-december-debate-000297">Politico recently reported</a> they must meet these qualifications:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Hit 4% support in at least four approved national or early-state polls, or hit 6% support in two approved early-state polls</li>
        <li>Have 200,000 unique donors with at least 800 donors in at least 20 states.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The qualification deadline for the December debates is December 12. So far, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, and Elizabeth Warren <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/14/778674519/10-democratic-candidates-qualify-for-next-weeks-november-debate">have already qualified</a>, and Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard, and Tom Steyer are on the path to qualification.</p>
      <h3>So, who has qualified for November?</h3>
      <p>The <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/democratic-debate-lineup.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur">New York Times</a></i> has reported that 10 candidates have qualified for the November debate: <b>Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard, and Tom Steyer</b>.</p>
      <p>Notably, Beto O'Rourke has dropped out of the race, and Julián Castro will be missing the debate for the first time. While Castro met the donor qualification, he did not meet the polling qualification.</p>
      <h3>Did Tulsi Gabbard actually boycott the October debate?</h3>
      <p>Just days before the October debate, Gabbard released a video where she said she was considering boycotting the debate since she believed the primary election was being "rigged."</p>
      <p>In the video, she said, “[The Democratic National Committee and the media] are attempting to replace the roles of voters in the early states, using polling and other arbitrary methods which are not transparent or democratic, and holding so-called debates which are not debates at all but rather commercialized reality television meant to entertain, not inform or enlighten. In short, the DNC and corporate media are trying to hijack the entire election process.”</p>
      <p>Gabbard then <a href="https://twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1183716774476312576">announced</a> she would be attending.</p>
