      <p>England are back in Test action on Thursday for the first time since the drawn Ashes series as they take on New Zealand in Mount Maunganui.</p>
      <p>Here the PA news agency looks at some areas of interest.</p>
      <h3>New era for England</h3>

      <p>On their last trip to New Zealand a little more than 18 months ago, England were rolled over for a meagre 58 in Auckland, their sixth lowest Test total of all-time – one of a number of batting collapses in recent years. Root has clearly had enough and wants to see more grit from the top order. In Dom Sibley, England have selected an opener who faced over 1,000 more balls than anyone else in Division One of the County Championship this year.</p>
      <h3>Combating flat pitches and the Kookaburra ball</h3>

      <p>England have often been bereft when confronted with an unresponsive surface as well as an ageing Kookaburra – which typically moves around less than the Dukes ball they use at home. Bad news then as the Bay Oval is expected to be batsman friendly on its maiden Test. The pace and hostility of Jofra Archer, set for his first Test overseas, could change their fortunes but the rest of the attack need to find a way to contain if they are unable to take wickets on docile pitches.</p>
      <h3>No more square pegs in round holes</h3>
