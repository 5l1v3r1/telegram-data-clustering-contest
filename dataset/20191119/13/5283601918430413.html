      <p>A day after incumbent telecom operators Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea announced plans to hike headline tariffs, Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio) said it is also planning to revise mobile tariffs. The latest telecom entrant, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, plans to hike tariffs in the “next few weeks”.</p>
      <p>However, the company did not specify an exact date or the quantum of hike.</p>
      <p>“Like other operators, we will also work with the Government and comply with the regulatory regime to strengthen the industry to benefit Indian consumers and take measures including appropriate increase in tariffs in next few weeks in a manner that does not adversely impact data consumption or growth in digital adoption and sustains investments,” RJio, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, said in a statement.</p>

      <p>The company also said it understands that TRAI is likely to initiate a consultation process for revision of telecom tariffs.</p>
      <p>Predominantly a data player, RJio has been offering voice calls free of charge, while it has been billing only for data usage. However, in October the operator decided to charge Interconnect Usage Charges (IUC) of 6 paise per minute, which in turn, literally withdrawing its free call offer. </p>
