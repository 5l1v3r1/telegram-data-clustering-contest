      <p> It is AEC-Q100-qualified for automotive design, where its small form factor is suitable for radar systems in vehicles.</p>
      <p> According to the distributor, the RFCMOS process enables a monolithic implementation of a system with three transmit and four receive channels, PLL and ADCs. The integrated frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar sensor operates in the 76GHz to 81GHz mmWave spectrum. It has a DSP subsystem, based on TI’s C674x DSP, for radar signal processing, as well as a built-in self-test (BIST) processor subsystem for radio configuration, control, and calibration.</p>
      <p> An onboard user-programmable Arm Cortex-R4F processor tracks and classifies objects, AutoSAR, and interface control.</p>
      <p> The distributor also stocks an evaluation board, the AWR1843 BoosterPack. This connects directly to the manufacturer’s LaunchPad development kits and contains everything required to start developing software for the on-chip C67x DSP core and Cortex-R4F controller, including onboard emulation for programming and debugging, buttons and LEDs for a simple user interface.</p>
