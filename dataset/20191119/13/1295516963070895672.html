      <p>After killing her older brother Lex in the Season 4 finale, the dying villain taunted his sister with the reveal that her friend Kara had been keeping her superhero secret identity from her all along. Feeling betrayed, Lena quietly plotted revenge and a plan to remove free will across the globe to prevent anyone from ever betraying each other ever again.</p>
