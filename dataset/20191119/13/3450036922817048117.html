      <p>OTTUMWA, Iowa â€” The Beach Ottumwa is undergoing maintenance in its off-season. <br/><br/>The water park, which has been open for over 20 years, will be receiving beautification work, like sandblasting the slides and painting different areas of the park.</p>
      <blockquote>"Right now, Mongan Painting and Sandblasting from northwestern Iowa [is] finishing up their work on the slide tower at the beach," said Park Director Gene Rathje. "They are sandblasting and painting the entire facility. Really, this is just normal maintenance after 27 years. It's just something that had to be done to prolong the life of the slide tower."</blockquote>
      <p>Work will be completed in plenty of time for the 2020 opening season of The Beach Ottumwa.</p>
