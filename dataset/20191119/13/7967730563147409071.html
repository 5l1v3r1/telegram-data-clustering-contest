        <b>Aries</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>March 21- April 19</i>
      </p>
      <p>Shy and reserved aren’t the usual words used to describe outgoing Rams. However, you’ll feel somewhat introverted particularly on a romantic level, but it will work in your favour. Maintaining a hint of mystery, whether you’re in a relationship or have your eye on someone, will boost your appeal and reel them in for a closer look.</p>

        <b>Taurus</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>April 20-May 20</i>
      </p>
      <p>Bulls are known for their practical natures but over the past few weeks you’ve had time to allow your creativity to take the reins. Bursts of inspiration, courtesy of the Sun energising your sector of artistic pursuits, will flow thick and fast. Make the most of them by plotting a course for your next brainchild.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gemini</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>May 21-June 21</i>
      </p>
      <p>Ruler Mercury has been throwing a few kinks in your sector of routine. This would be unsettling for most but spontaneous Geminis are likely to see the silver lining in last minute changes. Try to bring some order back into the equation by taking a few minutes to recalibrate, absorb and accommodate any sudden developments.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cancer</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>June 22-July 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>Streamlining, refining and improving have been an ongoing theme over the past few weeks as the Stars give your sector associated with routine and industry a cosmic workout. Today you will begin to see method in the madness. Heightened efficiency, confidence and time management skills will enable you to easily improve every facet of your life.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Leo</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>July 23-August 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>Mayhem at home today will stem from making assumptions. Clarity, listening and understanding is the way forward, so if in doubt lay all of your concerns on the table and have a calm discussion. If you feel the situation is too heated for a sit down soften impending confrontations with an email or put pen to paper.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Virgo</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>August 23-September 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>Stop expecting so much from yourself! Scaling down your ‘to do’ list won’t change what you achieve. However, it <i>will</i> minimise your frustration at not be able to get everything done and give you a more positive perception of the day’s events. Be patient regarding work and group projects when others aren’t on the same page as you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Libra</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>September 23-October 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>Has your attention been lacking on the home front? If so, devote more time to your humble abode. On a tangible level this is the good for addressing all manner of repairs and maintenance from leaking taps to commencing renovations. Creating a physically strong environment will reinforce the household dynamics and strengthen connections with loved ones.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Scorpio</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>October 23 – November 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Universe is trying to tell you something so pay attention! There’ll be just as much happening on the physical plane as there is in the ethers but try not to rush or feel pressured to cross the finish line. Take your time and feel free to change your mind if and when new information comes to light.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sagittarius</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>November 23-December 20</i>
      </p>
      <p>Vivacious Venus in your sign continues to illuminate your extroverted side. This will not only encourage you to mingle but also make you appear extra attractive in the eyes of others. You’ll be at your most vibrant so make the most of every occasion. Also take the opportunity today to get in touch with old friends.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Capricorn</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>December 21-January 19</i>
      </p>
      <p>You’re in a position to make great strides and transform your life. Dynamic Mars is bringing out your best boosting your tenacity, confidence and ambition while encouraging you to take risks that you normally wouldn’t dream of. Stepping out of your comfort zone and doing things differently will change your outlook and make pivotal life changes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aquarius</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>January 20-February 18</i>
      </p>
      <p>Lately you may have felt pressured to make a decision. Today though step back, look at the bigger picture and how it will affect you. You won’t be putting anybody out by changing your mind or taking your time so pump the brakes. There’s more to gain by slowing down and carefully contemplating on your next move.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pisces</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>February 19-March 20</i>
      </p>
      <p>Some people work better with a deadline and structured pace while others operate best under pressure. Regardless of how you operate, reassess your objectives and figure out how to achieve them. Begin by eliminating extraneous goals particularly those that you’ve outgrown or have taken a back seat to something you now deem more important or beneficial.</p>
