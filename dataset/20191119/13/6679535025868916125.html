      <h1>GVMC launches water bell concept as a pilot project</h1>
      <h2>The initiative will help in ensuring students stay hydrated, says Municipal Commissioner</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:06:11+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:06</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>The students of GVMC primary school at NGGOs Colony were surprised on Tuesday morning, as their school bell rang just one-and-hour after commencement of classes. While the children were looking at one another trying to fathom why the bell was sounded, their teachers asked them to take out their water bottles from their bags and have a few sips. A few students even questioned the teachers why it was necessary, teachers then explained the need of staying hydrated.</p>
      <p>Inspired by the Kerala government, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) has started implementing water breaks for the students in its schools from Tuesday, as a pilot project.</p>
      <p>“The schools will be having three water bells per day at fixed times in the morning and afternoon, when they will take water. Many students are irregular in drinking water and this initiative will help them in staying hydrated,” explained GVMC Commissioner G. Srijana.</p>
      <p>There are 147 GVMC schools, which include 116 primary and 27 high schools. About 30,000 students are studying in these schools. The water bell initiative was kick-started in a few schools on Tuesday by the GVMC and will soon be extended to all the schools.</p>
      <p>The water bell concept has been gaining momentum from the time when the Kerala government announced it. Several schools in Karnataka have also picked up the idea and have started to implement the concept.</p>
      <h3>Eco-friendly concern</h3>
      <p>To make sure that the initiative does not encourage plastic use in school campuses, the GVMC is also trying to tie up with some PSUs to distribute non-plastic drinking water bottles, which are eco-friendly</p>
      <p>“With this water bell concept, we should not encourage students to bring more plastic bottles to schools. So we are trying to tie up with some company which can distribute steel or copper water bottles,” Ms. Srijana said.</p>
      <p>She also said that the civic body has outsourced the maintenance of school toilets for better upkeep.</p>
      <p>“Making them drink water and not giving them hygienic toilets is not a good proposition,” she added.</p>
