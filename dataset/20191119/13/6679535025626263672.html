      <p>A brand new ambulance, which was set to specifically cater to the residents of Kallupatti area in Tirumangalam block, has been lying in a private shed in Narasingapuram for the last two months as officials from the Health Department said that Revenue Minister R. B. Udayakumar is yet to set a date for its inauguration.</p>
      <p>A source from the Public Health department said that the Minister had requested an ambulance for this region as several four-wheelers use the route to reach Courtallam.</p>
      <p>Since the area had frequently been on the news as accidents occurred, the Minister had suggested that an ambulance here would ensure a quick response.</p>
      <p>M. Irulandi, a member of the ‘108’ Ambulances Employees' Welfare Association, said that ambulance drivers from Tirumangalam, Kallikudi or Srivilliputtur had to drive all the way to the spot if an accident is reported in Kallupatti.</p>
      <p>“As we are all well aware, in case of accidents, the golden hour period is the most important. If we go minutes later, it may cause death. If the service is started, ambulance drivers will be under less stress,” he said.</p>
      <p>A source from the office of the Joint Director of Public Health said that the ambulance was unused due to a few license-related issues.</p>
      <p>“It is ready for operation. In the meantime, we have diverted other ambulances through this route,” he said.</p>
      <p>When contacted by <i>The Hindu</i>, the Minister said that he would enquire into the matter and that the ambulance would begin functioning at the earliest.</p>
      <p>“The area has many bends and is accident-prone. This is why I requested a new ambulance. We will ensure that it is up and running immediately,” he said.</p>
