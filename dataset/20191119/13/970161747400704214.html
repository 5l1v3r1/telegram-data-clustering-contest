      <p>It will mark the first winter vote the country has seen since 1923, when Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin sought to strengthen his party leadership.</p>
      <p>But it’s also the third election we’ve had in four years – so just when was the last one?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>When was the last General Election?</h3>
      <p>The last general election was held on Thursday 8 June 2017.</p>
      <p>Then-Prime Minister Theresa May – who had a working majority of just 17 – went head to head against Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to retain control of the country.</p>

      <h3>Why was it called?</h3>
      <p>The election was called just two months prior to Mrs May repeatedly promising not to call an early election.</p>
      <p>As per the Fixed-Term Parliament’s Act, the next general election was not scheduled until 2020.</p>
      <p>However, in the midst of Brexit referendum the previous year, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/04/18/theresa-may-announces-shock-general-election-6581204/">Mrs May claimed divisions within Parliament were hindering negotiations with the European Union</a> as she called for unity in Westminster.</p>

      <p>In a statement outside Downing Street, she said: ‘The country is coming together, but Westminster is not.</p>
      <p>‘In recent weeks Labour has threatened to vote against the deal we reach with the European Union.</p>
      <p>‘The Liberal Democrats have said they want to grind the business of government to a standsill.</p>
      <p>‘The Scottish National Party say they will vote against the legislation that formally repeals Britain’s membership of the European Union.’</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘So we need a General Election and we need one now, because we have at this moment a one-off chance to get this done while the European Union agrees its negotiating position and before the detailed talks begin.</p>

      <p>‘I have only recently and reluctantly come to this conclusion.’</p>
      <h3>Who won the 2017 General Election?</h3>
      <p>The 2017 General Election was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/06/10/the-final-breakdown-of-the-2017-general-election-6699422/">won by the Conservative Party however Ms May lost her majority</a>, having required the support of two-thirds of Parliament to continue her leadership.</p>
      <p>In an effort to prop up her minority government, she controversially agreed to a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/06/26/theresa-may-reaches-deal-with-dup-to-prop-up-minority-government-6735164/">Confidence and Supply Agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party</a> of Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>The election saw the Conservative lose 13 seats with 42.4% of the vote while Labour gained 30 seats with 40.1%.</p>
      <p>The SNP, which had won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats at the previous general election, lost 21.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems gained three seats while the Green Party retained its only seat.</p>
      <p>UKIP – the third largest party in the 2015 election and arguably instrumental to the result of the referendum – lost its only seat.</p>
