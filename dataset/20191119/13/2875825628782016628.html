      <h1>This Morning viewers confused by 'missing Phil' during fashion segment</h1>
      <h2>This Morning didn't give an explanation as to why Phil had vanished - but viewers had a lot of theories about his disappearing act</h2>

      <p>This Morning viewers were left very baffled as Phillip Schofield went missing on the programme today.</p>
      <p>Conveniently, Phil seemed to disappear during Trinny's fashion segment.</p>
      <p>Instead, Holly Willoughby was sat next to an empty chair as Trinny looked set to start her segment, with Phil's absence seemingly ignored.</p>
      <p>And confused fans flocked to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to speculate.</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "Is Phil locked in the loo?"</p>
      <p>While another joked: "Phil pulled a disappearing act."</p>

      <p>A third questioned: " Wait where did @schofe go?"</p>
      <p>"Where has @Schofe gone?!?" another baffled viewer asked.</p>
      <p>Following this, This Morning went to an ad break and when the programme returned, Phil was back at her side and no explanation was given.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the show, the pair spoke to Sally Lindsay about rumours she would be returning to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> .</p>
      <p>However Sally denied the rumours, revealing that she had been back for a documentary marking the soap's 60th birthday.</p>
      <p>she said: "It's basically a load of us that have left and have done quite well, we were talking about our memories of the street and how that set our careers up.</p>
      <p>"So I did this little 10 minute interview, didn't think anything of it. Then the next minute I'm going back to the street. I was like, 'That's the first I've heard!'"</p>
      <p>Asked whether she would ever return, she said: "Oh gosh, I'd never say never. I loved it - it was brilliant, it still is brillaint."</p>
