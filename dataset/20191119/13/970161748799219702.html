      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-big-bang-theory/">The Big Bang Theory</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kunal-nayyar/">Kunal Nayyar</a> has got deep by urging his fans to be more positive about themselves.</p>
      <p>We didn’t know we needed to hear this post until it dropped onto our feeds, but the 38-year-old has made sure his followers have taken time out of their day in order to reflect on their well being.</p>
      <p>Sharing a black and white picture of himself onto his grid, the star opened up on self-care.</p>
      <p>‘Take a pause from what you’re doing right now, and be aware of what you’re feeding your mind in this moment,’ he wrote to his 2.5million followers.</p>
      <p>‘If it is a negative thought about yourself replace it with a positive one, if it is a judgmental thought about someone else make it one of understanding and compassion, if it is me against the world, replace it with union with the universe…’</p>

      <p>Fans were quick to comment on the post and flooded the Raj star with praise.</p>
      <p>‘Just what I needed to read, thank you. Lots of love to you,’ one wrote while another added: ‘Love that! Thank you for putting such positivity out there and encouraging us to do the same!’</p>

      <p>Someone else teased: ‘If Raj had this kinda look I bet he wouldn’t have stayed single.’</p>
      <p>Kunal recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/27/big-bang-theorys-kunal-nayyar-breaks-social-media-silence-four-months-celebrate-diwali-10990770/">made his social media return to celebrate Diwali</a>, after taking a four-month break from the online world.</p>
      <p>In order to celebrate the Hindu festival of lights, created with the symbolism of light overcoming darkness, Kunal made his comeback where he hoped to make the world a little brighter – encouraging others to do the same.</p>
      <p>He wrote: ‘Happy Diwali. My first Diwali at home in Delhi after 20 years.</p>
      <p>‘Could not have thought of a better occasion to come back to Instagram and use this platform to spread love, to spread light, and to hopefully help bring you closer to yourself, because no matter where you are in your life we all have the ability to shine our inner light on this world.</p>
