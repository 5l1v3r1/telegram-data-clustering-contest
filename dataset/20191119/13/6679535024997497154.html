      <h2>Mulling over collecting ₹2 per sq. ft of the plot annually</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:23:43+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:23</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The problem of overgrown weeds in vacant plots in the layouts developed and approved by the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) is expected to find a way out with the urban body resolving to replicate the concept developed by the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) over the periodic maintenance of vacant plots.</p>
      <p>The expansive growth of wild plants in these plots has turned unsafe for neighbours and those living in the vicinity. The poorly-maintained plots have become breeding ground for mosquitoes and insects besides snakes. Instances of area residents throwing waste in such plots had also been reported.</p>
      <p>Most plots in the layouts developed by the MUDA and also those developed with approval from the MUDA have remained unkempt since the beginning of the formation of the layouts.</p>
      <p>In the light of complaints, the MUDA has proposed to collect ₹2 per sq. ft of the plot from the owner for its maintenance. It wants to combine this fee in the tax collected for the vacant plots every year. This way, it hopes to keep the plots and layouts clean. In case of private layouts that are yet to be handed over to the MUDA, the onus is on the developers for the maintenance of plots.</p>
      <p>MUDA Commissioner P.S. Kantharaju admitted to the problem of unkempt plots in its limits and the complaints from residents. “Under the Karnataka Urban Development Act (KUDA), we have no provision to act against the owner for keeping the plot untidy. Therefore, we have proposed to collect fee annually from the owners and use it for the maintenance of the plots periodically.”</p>
      <p>He told <i>The Hindu </i>that he has asked his engineers to work on the plan collating all details and seek approval from the board.</p>
      <p>However, the plots belonging to the government and other public institutions have to be maintained by the caretaker or the custodian.</p>
