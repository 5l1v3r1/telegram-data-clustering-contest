      <p>ShemarooMe has launched on the Roku platform to users in the US. The availability of the channel on Roku devices further strengthens ShemarooMe’s presence in the US market by offering its vast library of Bollywood and regional language content. The collaboration allows Roku users access to ShemarooMe’s varied Indian content on their smart TV.</p>
      <p>With an ardent fan-base of Indian content including movies, regional cinema, kids and devotional content, the US market has always been positively receptive towards Indian content. Bollywood and Indian regional content are popular not only amongst Indians residing in the US but also with the natives in the US region and has seen an increase demand in viewership.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the association, Zubin Dubash, COO Digital, Shemaroo Entertainment Limited said, “We are delighted to launch ShemarooMe on the Roku platform. Now, Roku customers can enjoy a lean-back experience of over 10,000 hours of their favorite Indian masala content on the ShemarooMe channel on their Roku devices.”</p>
