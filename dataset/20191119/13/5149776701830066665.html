      <h2>Richard Giles Taylor will have his case heard in August</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:52:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:52</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Bunn</a></address>
      <p>A primary school teacher has pleaded not guilty to 18 charges relating to the sexual touching of children.</p>
      <p>Richard Giles Taylor, 53, appeared at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/courts">Nottingham Crown Court</a> which was told his trial is due to start on August 10.</p>
      <p>Three charges are of indecent assault and are dated between April 1999 and August 2000.</p>
      <p>Another 15 are allegations of sexual assault of children under 13. These carry dates from September 2004 to August 2017.</p>
      <p>Taylor also denied two counts of making indecent photographs of a child on August 8, 2016.</p>
      <p>Dawn Pritchard, prosecuting, told the court: "This matter needs to be adjourned for trial. We are looking at about three weeks."</p>
      <p>Judge Gregory Dickinson QC, the Recorder of Nottingham, said the August 10 date had been found with a trial lasting "three to four weeks."</p>
      <p>Adrian Reynolds, defending, said they were awaiting a summary of the case.</p>
      <p>The judge set a timetable for the prosecution to compile its case and hand it to lawyers representing Taylor, whose team will then draw up "a defence document."</p>
      <p>The matter is due back before the crown court on March 27 as part of the preparations for the trial.</p>
      <p>Bail was extended to Taylor. When he initially appeared before city magistrates, he gave his address as Exchange Road, West Bridgford.</p>
      <p>Children named in the charges have their identities protected for life.</p>
