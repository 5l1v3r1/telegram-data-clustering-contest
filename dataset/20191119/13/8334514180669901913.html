      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Chinese power generation group SDIC (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/600886.SS">600886.SS</a>) is pressing ahead with plans to launch an offering of global depositary receipts (GDRs) in London under a link with the Shanghai exchange, defying a dismal season for stock listings in Europe.</p>

      <p>The offering would include newly issued GDRs representing underlying "A" shares in the firm, the company said <a href="http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/htmlnews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541&amp;u=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20191119:nRSS9041Ta">here</a> in a statement.</p>
      <p>If successful, SDIC will make its London debut in December, becoming the second Chinese firm to float in Britain under the Stock Connect link with the Shanghai exchange.</p>
      <p>It would also be a bright spot for the London Stock Exchange, which has seen a number of initial public offerings (IPOs) canceled or postponed amid market uncertainty.</p>
      <p>Indian special effects firm DNEG and Kazakh finance firm Kaspi.kz were the latest companies to pull their London listing plans.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported in July that SDIC had hired banks to list in London via the Shanghai-London Stock Connect scheme, in a boost for Britain’s status as a financial center ahead of Brexit.</p>
      <p>SDIC Power, which has a market value of $7.9 billion, is looking to raise between $600 and $800 million from the sale, a source familiar with the deal told Reuters.</p>
      <p>The proceeds will be used to help expand SDIC’s renewable energy business overseas and pay down offshore debt.</p>
      <p>Goldman Sachs International, UBS AG London Branch and HSBC Bank plc are acting as joint global co-ordinators and joint bookrunners for the offering which was previously expected to raise as much as $1 billion.</p>
      <h3>SHANGHAI STOCK LINK</h3>
      <p>The company, which invests in, constructs and operates electric power plants, has a presence in Britain through its ownership of Red Rock Power, a Scotland-based wind farm operator.</p>
      <p>On July 3, SDIC said its board had approved a resolution to sell its GDRs in London.</p>
      <p>“Through this offering, we will gain better access to the international capital markets,” Chairman Zhu Jiwei said.</p>
      <p>Chinese brokerage Huatai Securities (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/601688.SS">601688.SS</a>) finalised its London listing in June, raising more than $1.5 billion, but there had been concerns that not many companies would follow its lead.</p>
      <p>Britain wants to offer Chinese companies an attractive trading environment as it sees cooperation with Beijing as critical after Brexit. Earlier this year it launched a much-anticipated link with the Shanghai exchange.</p>
      <p>Under the scheme, Chinese companies can list depositary receipts pegged to their Shanghai-listed shares, while British companies can issue shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.</p>
