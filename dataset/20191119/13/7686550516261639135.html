      <h1>The wonderful thing that happened when an 80-year-old dropped hundreds of pounds in Merthyr Tydfil</h1>
      <h2>Francis Morgan was shopping to buy Christmas presents for his nine grandchildren when he realised his money had gone</h2>

      <p>An elderly man has been reunited with hundreds of pounds he lost while out Christmas shopping for his family.</p>
      <p>Francis Morgan withdrew the cash at the Post Office in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/merthyr-tydfil">Merthyr Tydfil</a> before heading into town to buy gifts for his nine grandchildren.</p>
      <p>But the 80-year-old, from Pant, soon realised he had lost the money he had just withdrawn.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, a kind member of the public had the good conscience to hand the money to management after finding it in St Tydfil Shopping Centre.</p>
      <p>After a brief investigation to track down Mr Morgan, South Wales Police PCSOs reunited him with his shopping budget.</p>
      <p>A police spokesman said Mr Morgan went on his shopping trip on Wednesday, November 14.</p>

      <p>He said two Merthyr PCSOs had identified Mr Morgan using the centre's CCTV.</p>
      <p>After a few checks, they carried out some enquiries in Pant and within hours they had managed to find Mr Morgan and give him back his money.</p>
      <p>PCSO Ross Hadley said: "It goes to show, the spirit of Christmas is certainly not lost on the people of Merthyr Tydfil.</p>
      <p>"I’d like to thank the person who handed that money in – their honesty and integrity really has, already, made this Christmas a special one for one Merthyr pensioner and not to mention his grandchildren, who I’m in no doubt will be excited to get their presents this year.</p>
      <p>"He was delighted to see his money again."</p>
