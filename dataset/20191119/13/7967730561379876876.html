      <h1>The 'birth plan' is a shortcut to disappointment, time to ditch it</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Polly Dunning</a></address>
      <p>“Have you written your birth plan yet?”</p>
      <p>It’s one of those questions you seem to get a lot at the tail end of your pregnancy. Both from friends and family, and those apps and websites that tell you which fruit your baby is most comparable in size to this week.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/kidsfamilies/MCFhealth/maternity/Pages/maternity-care-survey-summary.aspx">2018 survey</a> of more than 17,000 Australian women, 70 per cent rated having a birth plan as either "important" or "very important". There are thousands of templates available online and mountains of information on how to write them. But, as much as women are using birth plans to take control of their bodies and birth experiences, still only <a href="http://www.safemotherhoodforall.org.au/news/only-58-of-australian-women-have-the-birth-they-want/">58 per cent of us</a> feel we get the birth we wanted.</p>

      <p>Obviously, there are myriad reasons why women are feeling disappointed with their birth experience (and why one in three say they are experiencing birth trauma, while <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-31/birth-trauma-ptsd-feminisms-forgotten-issue/11649116?fbclid=IwAR2_r8g0RYAeL4NLBSZUbHwV5Dgm-rsrUsq_hQFXbSUeFex3cveqBqYHDOw">10 per cent</a> experience postnatal post-traumatic stress disorder). But one of the contributing factors is that birth plans are failing women.</p>
      <p>There is no formalised process or standard format for creating a birth plan within the current care model in Australia. It isn’t a part of standard care to work with a pregnant woman and her partner to create a plan for birth and, given most Australian women will see a different midwife at each prenatal appointment and at her labour and delivery, this is a big problem.</p>
      <p>Catherine Bell, a researcher, doula and birth cartographer, says Australia has a lack of continuity of midwifery care. Continuous care is recognised as the gold standard with better outcomes for both mother and baby and produces higher levels of satisfaction with the birth for women, but it is only accessible for about<a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD004667/PREG_midwife-led-continuity-models-care-compared-other-models-care-women-during-pregnancy-birth-and-early"> 8 to 10 per cent of us</a>, which means women may feel disconnected and unable to communicate with their care provider.</p>

      <p>“Tensions can ... arise when a woman creates a birth plan without consulting the care provider, using a template from online which focuses on one, ideal, birth plan and maybe a caesarean as a contingency, based on a smorgasbord of options. Some options are incompatible with others and depending on the source of the template, may not reflect the standard care of the medical system,” says Bell.</p>
      <p>The other issue with birth plans is we tend to mainly plan for our ideal birth and many of us unintentionally intermingle our feelings of success or failure with how our birth unfolds. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6386786/">2018 study</a> found 65 per cent of surveyed women identified feelings of failure around the birth process. Great, a knock to our confidence right when we’re trying to figure out how to care for this squirming ball of love in our arms.</p>
      <p>It’s not just our confidence that suffers, CEO of PANDA Julie Borninkhof says about half of the organisation’s 10,000 annual helpline callers report experiencing feelings of loss and grief as a result of the birth process and “19 per cent of those [who experience trauma] report that birth trauma is creating an ongoing issue with how they’re coping as a new parent”.</p>
      <p>As much as some may like to dismiss the focus on the birth experience as like focussing on the wedding not the marriage, negative feelings around the birth, Borninkhof says, “can impact [a mother’s] physical and emotional wellbeing and the wellbeing of their baby”.</p>
      <blockquote>Many of us unintentionally intermingle our feelings of success or failure with how our birth unfolds.</blockquote>
      <p>A sense of control and agency can really count when it comes to how we experience the birth process. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3392605/">Research shows</a> whether we have a positive or negative recollection of our birth experience is often about whether we feel like we are making the decisions.</p>
      <p>And that’s one of the major issues with birth plans: if we plan for and commit to one ideal scenario, deviations can give us a real sense we aren’t in control, we don’t know what is going on and that birth is something happening to us instead of something we are doing with the help of our midwife and/or doctor.</p>
      <p>Bell sees this as the difference between informed consent and informed decision making. The former is agreeing with a procedure proposed by a medical professional, often at a moment of high stress and vulnerability and where the default position is to comply, while the latter is about exploring the potential options ahead of time and making decisions in consultation with your care provider.</p>

      <p>To assist women in making informed decisions, Bell has developed "birth maps" as an alternative to birth plans. The map’s “if this, then that” approach puts women back in the driver’s seat of their own birth experience and medical care.</p>
      <p>"Decisions are pre-made for various scenarios, with consultation with the care providers and communicated to all the key players … It’s a multi-pathed map offering alternate routes."</p>
      <p>In the absence of continuity of care, midwifery professor Hannah Dahlen advocates for doulas as a person who is "like a human map in the situation” as well as supporting the use of birth maps or a very simple birth plan developed with the care provider.</p>
      <p>Borninkhof agrees: “Anything that doesn’t set people up to feel like they’re failing because they haven’t reached that one state that was articulated in the birth plan … is a really good thing.”</p>
      <p>Birth plans have served their purpose. They brought women back into the conversation about birth and their own bodies, which we were largely shut out of for decades if not centuries. But they’ve now become part of what Hannah Dahlen dubs the “battlefield” of birth instead of facilitating a conversation and exploration of the various pathways birth can take.</p>
      <p>Of course, continuity of midwifery care available for all Australian women who wish to use it is what most in the sector see as the goal and the best chance for minimising the trauma experienced by so many women. But, in the meantime, measures which help us be better informed can give us back that sense of agency and control over our bodies and birth experiences.'</p>
