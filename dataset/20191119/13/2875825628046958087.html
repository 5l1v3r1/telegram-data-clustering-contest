      <h2>Ant McPartlin's estranged wife Lisa Armstrong has vowed to have her day in court over their divorce proceedings - and the I'm A Celeb host is just as determined to avoid it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:31:56+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:31</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Lisa Armstrong's friends have advised her to "stay calm" as her increasingly bitter divorce with estranged husband Ant McPartlin reaches its final stages.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> makeup artist has rejected a proposed settlement of £31million - half of Ant's £62million fortune - as well as their former marital home in London's upmarket Chiswick.</p>
      <p>Instead, Lisa's said to be wanting her day in court and has so far refused to sign Ant's non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that would be part of any financial settlement her legal team thrashes out with his.</p>
      <p>Last week she savagely liked several tweets slating Ant and his new girlfriend - Lisa's former friend and personal assistant - Anne-Marie Corbett, and begged followers: "Don't believe the lies."</p>

      <p>"This time of year - the build up to I'm A Celebrity - can be difficult for Lisa," a source tells Closer magazine.</p>
      <p>"But her family and friends are urging her not to 'like' any more tweets about Ant and Anne-Marie. Of course, it's not easy seeing Ant and her former friend looking so loved-up in Australia - but her inner circle are advising her to keep the upper hand by remaining calm and dignified."</p>
      <p>The insider added: "She's had so much public support since they split, which she's grateful for. But her pals say it's important she doesn't go too far and come across as bitter on social media."</p>
      <p>Lisa has told her fans she "won't be bullied" after Ant was said to be desperate to get their divorce settlement sorted before he flew out to the I'm A Celebrity jungle.</p>

      <p>But as his ex has held firm and refused to sign a controversial NDA, the latest round of the mediation talks failed.</p>
      <p>The cost of their post-split discussions is believed to have spiralled to more than £1.5million as Ant 'bombards' Lisa with expensive legal letters.</p>
      <p>The pair are yet to reach an agreement about the custody arrangements for their labrador, Hurley, who currently spends a week at each of their houses and is shuttled back and forth by a private chaffueur.</p>
      <p>After a hellish year of two stints in rehab, a public battle with prescription drugs and booze, and his shameful drink-driving crash in March 2018, Ant is no doubt hoping the public will continue to support him as he returns to his TV work.</p>

      <p>But without Lisa agreeing to sign the NDA, he's reportedly not signing off on a financial settlement until she complies - concerned about what could come out in open court.</p>
      <p>"Lisa is an honest, loyal and decent human being. She isn’t interested in how much money she gets," an insider told the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10333823/ant-mcpartlin-lisa-armstrong-divorce-gag-order/">Sun</a> last week.</p>
      <p>"She told her dad Derek on his death bed earlier this year that she would stand strong and she's not about to go back on her word."</p>
      <p>The source went on: "She won't sign an NDA. As far as she's concerned, he is welcome to his money.</p>
      <p>"It’s not about that for her. She's appalled at the way she has been treated ever since they split up, by people she loved, trusted and called friends."</p>

      <p>As the Mirror reported back in December last year, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/lisa-armstrong-axed-bgt-working-13710584">Lisa was axed from her freelance makeup job</a> on Britain's Got Talent after show bosses decreed it "untenable" for her to continue working in close proximity to Ant.</p>
      <p>It came six months after she found out via the press that Ant was in a new relationship with her friend and former personal assistant Anne-Marie Corbett.</p>
      <p>Lisa was left reeling when the couple went public and took to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to blast Anne-Marie for breaking the 'Girl Code'.</p>
      <p>It seems that has fuelled her determination not to be pushed over - and certainly not to sign Ant's NDA.</p>
