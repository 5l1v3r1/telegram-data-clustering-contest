      <p>The Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) Worldwide has called on Bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson to support the Governor-elect of the state, Chief David Lyon.</p>
      <p>IYC in a statement signed by its President, Eric Omare further appealed to the Candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to accept defeat and congratulate the winner.</p>
      <p>Omare said: “We congratulate the Governor-elect of Bayelsa State, Chief David Lyon of the All Progressive Congress (APC) for coming out victorious in the keenly contested November 16, governorship elections. Your victory is a manifestation of the wishes of the people of Bayelsa State and by extension the Ijaw Nation.</p>
      <p>“We call on other contestants, who lost out in the contest to join hands with the Governor-elect in the interest of the Ijaw nation. We also call on the outgoing Governor, Seriake Dickson, who is a strong advocate of the Ijaw interest to support the Governor-elect in the interest of the Ijaw nation.</p>
      <p>“The Governor-elect, Chief Lyon, is a son of the Ijaw nation; hence we should all give him the needed support. The people of Bayelsa State have spoken through their votes and they have spoken loud and clear.</p>

      <p>“Having come out successful in a keenly contested election, the IYC call on the Governor-elect to use his position to unite the Ijaw nation from Akwa Ibom State to Ondo State for a common purpose just as the Late Governor-General of the Ijaw Nation Chief D. S. P. Alamieyesiegha did.</p>
      <p>“The Governor-elect must see himself as a leader of all Ijaw people with a pan-Ijaw mandate irrespective of political party affiliation. Chief Lyon must learn from the experience of the last years where the Ijaws have been so polarized including our struggle platforms: the Ijaw National Congress (INC) and the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) worldwide.</p>
      <p>“It is our strong believe that the Ijaw nation can rise again with the incoming Governor of Bayelsa State providing the right leadership. Let the Ijaw Nation rise again.”</p>
