      <h1>Yaya Toure: 'Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic was my hardest opponent'</h1>
      <h2>Former <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/"><b>Manchester City</b></a> star <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/yaya-toure/"><b>Yaya Toure</b></a> has revealed that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nemanja-matic/"><b>Nemanja Matic</b></a> was the hardest opponent that he faced during his career.</h2>

      <p>Toure spent eight seasons at the Etihad, winning three Premier League titles and one FA Cup as he cemented himself as one of the best Premier League midfielders.</p>
      <p>The Ivorian, who made a total of 316 appearances for City, left the club in 2018 and now plays for Chinese side Qingdao Huanghai.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the hardest player he faced during his career, Toure told <i>The Times</i>: "Nemanja Matic was complicated. He's not quick but he's so strong, clever.</p>
      <p>"All the rest of the opponents, because I always looked at them carefully before games, I get their weakness."</p>
      <p>One game during which Matic's omnipresent influence at the base of midfield came clear was when Toure's City <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/live-commentary/live-commentary-man-city-vs-chelsea_134944.html">lost 1-0</a> at home to a Chelsea side managed by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a> which contained the Serbia international, whose excellent display helped to condemn the Citizens to their first home defeat of the 2013-14 season.</p>
