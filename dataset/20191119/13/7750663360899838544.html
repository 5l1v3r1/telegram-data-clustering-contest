      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/brazil/"><b>Brazil</b></a> manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tite/"><b>Tite</b></a> has insisted that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lionel-messi/"><b>Lionel Messi</b></a> cannot be compared with three-time World Cup winner <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pele/"><b>Pele</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The latter is regarded by many as the greatest footballer of all time, with the forward playing a talismanic role in the famous Brazil team - often regarded as the best side in football history - that won the World Cup in 1970.</p>
      <p>However, despite not winning the World Cup, others believe that Messi's otherworldly abilities with the ball at his feet elevate him above any other former legend.</p>
      <p>Giving his two cents on the matter, Tite told <i>Goal</i>: "Pele is incomparable. Anybody who wants to compare Pele to any other athlete... do you know what I do? I hear but I don't listen.</p>
      <p>"It's as if this person doesn't know the history of this man's quality... this guy was phenomenal. Once I said that Messi is extraordinary.</p>
      <p>"I meant he's extraordinary to the present time and among humans, with his creativity. Pele is out of normal patterns and I'm not saying this because I'm a Brazilian. You can't find a defect. If somebody comes to me and starts to make comparisons, for me it has no credibility."</p>
      <p>Tite and Messi were recently involved in a touchline spat during which the Barcelona forward told the former to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/brazil/news/silva-messi-should-show-more-respect_379666.html?t1573935502">"shut up".</a></p>
      <p>Messi was making his first appearance for Argentina since his three-month ban - handed out after the 32-year-old accused the CONMEBOL of corruption - was lifted and celebrating by scoring the winner in a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/argentina/result/result-lionel-messi-returns-as-argentina-defeat-brazil-in-saudi-arabia_379140.html">1-0 victory</a> over Tite's side.</p>
