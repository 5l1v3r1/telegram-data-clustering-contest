      <p>YAKIMA, Wash. - A man is under arrest after police say he tried to kidnap the 1-year-old baby daughter of a woman he met through a dating app.</p>
      <p>According to court documents, 24-year-old Thomas Lanier came to Sunnyside to hang out with the woman at her home in the 1300 block of South 11th Street on Friday.</p>
      <p>The woman says at one point she took a shower and when she came out Lanier and her 1-year-old daughter were gone, police records say.</p>
      <p>She says she ran from the apartment in just a bath towel yelling for help, and then heard a faint cry from her baby.</p>
      <p>She told police she ran in the direction of the cry and found Lanier walking down the street, holding her baby. When she got to him, she says Lanier handed the child back to her, according to the case file.</p>
      <p>The woman continued shouting for help and saying that he'd kidnapped her baby.</p>
      <p>She says Lanier then grabbed her around the neck and told her to be quiet or he was going to kill her, court documents say.</p>
      <p>A neighbor then came outside and asked what was going on, and the woman yelled to them to call the police.</p>
      <p>Investigators say Lanier left before police could arrive, but later returned to the apartment to retrieve a cell phone and was then arrested.</p>
      <p>In a police interview, Lanier said he was holding the baby in the apartment while the woman took a shower when he heard a voice saying he was going to get robbed. He said he then ran out of the apartment holding the baby and got lost, according to court records.</p>
      <p>Lanier is now facing charges of second-degree kidnapping and felony harassment.</p>
      <p>Police say Lanier is a registered sex offender out of Oregon.</p>
