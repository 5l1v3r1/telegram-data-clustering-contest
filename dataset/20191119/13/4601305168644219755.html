      <p>A young girl snatched from her mother's arms on a Texas street was traced two days later to a nearby hotel, where cops busted down the door and arrested the kidnapper. Here's an <i>Inside Edition</i> segment showing the kidnapping, partically capture from a nearby video doorbell, and the hotel raid.</p>
      <blockquote>Seven months after an 8-year-old girl was kidnapped while walking with her mom in their Texas neighborhood, police released heart-stopping video of the moment officers busted into the suspect's hotel room and rescued her. Michael Webb, 51, kidnapped the 8-year-old girl on May 18 as she was walking with her mom in Fort Worth. As the distraught mom tried to fight him off, he was able to get the girl in his car and take off. She called 911 and police immediately went searching for the girl.</blockquote>
      <p>They <a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/texas-man-convicted-brazen-abduction-8-year-old-girl">almost bungled it</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>Acting on a tip, police in nearby Forest Hill searched Webb’s hotel room early the next day but didn’t find her. Two hours later, after getting another tip, Forest Hill and Fort Worth police responded. The girl was found hidden in a laundry basket.<br/><br/>The Forest Hill police chief fired a sergeant who expressed doubt about the tip that led to the second visit.</blockquote>
