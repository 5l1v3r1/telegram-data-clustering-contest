      <h1>Swansea City to battle Stoke City for experienced Celtic star once tracked by Cardiff City - reports</h1>
      <h2>The Swans are set to go in for the experienced winger, who could be available for nothing in the summer</h2>

      <p>Swansea City are reportedly keen on making a move for Celtic midfielder Jonny Hayes, but could well face competition for his signature.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4969237/swansea-stoke-city-celtic-jonny-hayes-parkhead/">The Scottish Sun,</a> Stoke City are also weighing up a possible move for the Irishman, who is out of contract at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Celtic are believed to be eager on keeping the 32-year-old at Parkhead, with reports in Scotland suggesting they are hoping to tie him down to a new deal at the club.</p>
      <p>Hayes is free to speak with other clubs in the New Year, and could be available for nothing in the summer, which would make him an attractive proposition for the Swans.</p>
      <p>It's the second time in the last few days that Steve Cooper's side have been linked with a move for a Scottish Premierhship star, having been mentioned as a possible suitor for <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/cardiff-city-swansea-city-battle-17271292">Lyndon Dykes over the weekend</a> , along with bitter rivals Cardiff City.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/celtic-star-jonny-hayes-says-13550617">The Bluebirds were even linked with a move for Hayes two years ago.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Whether they would be willing to rival any potential approach from <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea-city-fc">Swansea</a> this time around remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>Hayes has so far made 16 appearances for the Celts this season, and even scored in the Old Firm clash with Rangers at Ibrox in September.</p>
