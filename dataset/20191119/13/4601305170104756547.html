      <h1>A game jam where coders were limited to two Tweets-worth of characters</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:15:15+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/jstruan" target="_blank">John Struan</a></address>
      <p>The rules for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/tweettweetjam">TweetTweetJam</a> were simple--keep it short:</p>
      <blockquote>Why 560?<br/>Because you don't always need a ton of code to make something fun. Because sometimes it's nice to scale back. But mostly because it's the length of two tweets. Use a minifier if you need to, and bend the rules if you can. PICO-8 is our recommended tool, but TIC-80 and other text-based engines will work as well!<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>1. Your final game code must be 560 characters or less. This includes spaces and brackets.<br/>2. No spritesheets or external art libraries allowed! All of your game art must fit into your code. Symbols such as 웃 and ★ are acceptable, as long as they work in your editor and can be included in a tweet!</blockquote>
      <p>The 60 entries included a typing game, city builder, and downhill racer:</p>
