      <h1>Sweden drops investigation into Assange rape charges</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:51:04+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rebecca-klar" target="_blank">Rebecca Klar</a></address>
      <p>Sweden’s investigation into WikiLeaks founder <a href="https://thehill.com/people/julian-assange">Julian Assange</a> for an alleged rape has been discontinued, <a href="https://apnews.com/933e765431c643eab301c69f19ecd582">The Associated Press</a> reported Tuesday. </p>
      <p>“I want to inform about my decision to discontinue the preliminary investigation,” Deputy Chief Prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson said at a news conference, according to AP. </p>
      <p>Persson pointed at “weakened” evidence as a cause for ending the investigation while saying the woman who made the allegation was credible and reliable.</p>
      <p>“The evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed since the events in question,” Persson said.</p>
      <p>She added that the woman “submitted a credible and reliable version of events” and said that her “statements have been coherent, extensive and detailed,” according to AP. </p>
      <p>Swedish authorities had <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/443342-authorities-in-sweden-reopen-rape-investigation-into-assange">reopened</a> the rape case in May. </p>
      <p>A Swedish court ruled in June that Assange should not be detained, AP reports. </p>
      <p>The reopened case came just two months after Assange was evicted from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where he had been living since 2012. </p>
      <p>Assange is currently serving a 50-week sentence in a London prison for skipping bail in 2012. </p>
      <p>A Swedish case of alleged sexual misconduct against Assange was dropped in 2017 when the statute of limitations expired, but a rape allegation remains. Assange has denied wrongdoing and said the allegations were politically motivated. </p>
      <p>Kristinn Hrafnsson, WikiLeaks editor-in-chief, said in response to the announcement of the dropped case, “Let us now focus on the threat Mr. Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment,” <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/sweden-drops-investigation-into-alleged-rape-by-julian-assange">Fox News</a> reports. </p>
      <p>Assange is wanted in the U.S. on charges unrelated to the rape case.</p>
