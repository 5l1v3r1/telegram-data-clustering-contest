      <p>Climate change can cause much faster and higher levels of ocean, a study of the previous <b>warming period</b> (125,000 years ago) showed, BTA reported, quoted by NOVA.</p>
      <p>The water then rose 10 meters above current levels to 3 meters per century, according to scientists at the Australian National University. This scenario would be a disaster for hundreds of millions of people.</p>
      <p>As the periods of cooling and warming the Earth alternate, scientists have examined data from the previous inter-glacial period 125,000 years ago. At that time, average temperatures were about a degree higher than present, but climate change over the past 200 years has been faster due to industrial greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the study of this interglacial period "shows only the lower bound of the estimates of what may happen," the study authors wrote. According to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change from September last year, ocean levels will rise by about 43 cm by the end of the century if temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius and by 84 cm at 3 degrees Celsius, if these trends continue.</p>
