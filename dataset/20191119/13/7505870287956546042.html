      <h1>Reminder: You’re crazy if you have Verizon and you don’t get your free year of Disney+</h1>

      <p>Happy anniversary, Disney+! Everyone’s favorite new streaming service is finally here, and it launched exactly one week ago today. Are we going to celebrate the arrival of Disney+ again every single week, month, and year? No, but we thought the service’s one-week anniversary would be the perfect time to remind our readers that there’s a wonderfully easy way to get a full year of Disney+ for free. That’s right… despite the facts that Disney+ is brand new and that it’s the hottest streaming service in America right now, there’s already a way to get the service for a full year without paying a single cent.</p>
      <p>As popular as Disney+ already is, and as much fantastic content as it has in its catalog on day one, Disney could probably get away with charging at least as much as Netflix for the service. Right out of the gate on launch day, there were already <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/12/disney-plus-shows-list-all-movies-available-at-launch/">an astounding 639 different movies and shows available to stream on Disney+</a>. But instead of trying to squeeze as much money as possible out of subscribers, Disney decided to make its new streaming service shockingly affordable. Somehow, Disney+ costs $6.99 each month if you pay monthly, or just $5.83 per month if you pay annually. That price point makes the service a must-have — but even at that price, there’s no reason to pay for it if you can get it for free.</p>
      <p>Disney+ offers a tremendous amount of value for as little as $5.83 per month. Right from the start, you get almost all the blockbuster Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, nearly every Disney movie and show that has ever been made, National Geographic content, every episode of <i>The Simpsons</i>, all the beloved Pixar movies, and more. Then on top of that, you also get access to exclusive content from the Star Wars Universe (<i>The Mandalorian</i>, etc.), the MCU (<i>What If…?</i>, <i>WandaVision</i>, <i>Falcon and the Winter Soldier</i>, etc.), Disney (<i>Lady and the Tramp</i>, etc.), and more. It’s nuts that accessing this massive, ever-expanding catalog of content costs as little as $5.83 per month, but it’s even crazier that there’s already a way that you can get it for free.</p>
      <p>Verizon recently generated some hype by offering subscribers Apple Music for free with its unlimited wireless plans, and now it’s stirring up even more buzz with its latest offer that just kicked off last week. Verizon is giving a free year of Disney+ to everyone who subscribes to a 4G or 5G unlimited wireless plan, or to anyone who subscribes to Fios Home Internet or 5G Home Internet.</p>
      <p>Here are some key points from Verizon’s announcement:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>On November 12, Verizon will begin offering 12 months of Disney+ to all new and existing 4G LTE and 5G unlimited wireless customers</li>
        <li>New Verizon Fios Home Internet and 5G Home Internet customers can also enjoy 12 months of Disney+ on us</li>
        <li>Verizon customers can enjoy everything Disney+ has to offer, including high-quality and commercial-free viewing, up to four concurrent streams, downloads for offline viewing, personalized recommendations, and the ability to set up to seven different profiles</li>
