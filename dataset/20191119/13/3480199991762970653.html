      <p>Lynx deodorant is an icon of gym changing rooms and thoughtless Christmas gifts across the UK, but now it’s looking to be just as at home in your car.</p>
      <p>The popular Unilever-owned brand has released a range of car air fresheners, bringing some of its most popular scents to the cabin.</p>
      <p>Available at launch as a Halfords exclusive, there is a variety of fresheners to choose from. The cheapest offering is a disc-shaped freshener designed to hang from the rear-view mirror and is available at £2.99.</p>

      <p>For £3.99, a ‘gel can’ freshener that fits into a cup holder or door pocket is said to be a solution for a ‘long-lasting release’ of fragrance, while the same price can also secure a unit that clips to air-con vents. Smaller versions of the latter are available at £3.59.</p>
      <p>Finally, those who just can’t get enough Lynx can opt for a refillable, vent-clipping freshener. This £7.99 unit incorporates a scented stick, which can be swapped out at any time for a replacement of a different smell — with packs of two sticks costing £1.99.</p>
      <p>Scents available include Lynx’s Africa, Black, Ice Chill, Gold and Dark Temptation.</p>
      <p>Mariana Freitas, car air freshener expert for Halfords, said: “Lynx is an instantly recognisable and iconic brand with fragrances and shower products loved by millions, so we are thrilled to be selling these exclusively for the next two months.</p>
      <p>“It means that motorists will be able to bring Lynx fragrances into their cars with the ultimate car accessory – a long-lasting car freshener with a modern and high-end design. We know our customers love to look after their cars and hope this latest addition means they will be excited about keeping their car interiors smelling fresh.”</p>
