      <p>A property tycoon was ordered off the roads for speeding in his luxury Bentley despite claiming he would suffer ‘exceptional hardship’ after having to hire seven new chauffeurs during his last ban.</p>
      <p>David Russell, 63, clocked up 24 points on his licence after his £114,000 company Bentayga supercar repeatedly triggered speed cameras and he failed to say who was behind the wheel.</p>
      <p>The former carpet salesman, who now heads a £271 million property company in Manchester, urged city magistrates to spare him, claiming he had ‘meetings on’ and had lost a string of chauffeurs who were unhappy with ferrying him around during his last disqualification.</p>
      <p>He also said the firm had a ‘fleet of cars’ and told the court he was oblivious of the offences because his PA would usually handle traffic matters after they were forwarded on by his housekeeper.</p>

      <p>But magistrates declined to waive the disqualification under ‘exceptional hardship’ provisions and banned him from driving for six months.</p>
      <p>Russell was also fined £2,465 and warned he could face jail if caught behind the wheel during that time.</p>

      <p>The wealthy businessman was charged after failing to respond to police letters demanding to know who was driving when the six-litre 180mph W12 auto estate was caught speeding.</p>
      <p>He was later convicted in his absence of three counts of failing to produce documents identifying the driver and given 18 penalty points – in addition to the six he had already accumulated from similar incidents in 2017 and 2018.</p>
      <p>Russell explained his non-attendance as being a result of him having mistaken the company to be on trial rather than himself.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t believe it was me that was speeding,’ he said. ‘Several cars are used to meet clients coming in from Saudi and Abu Dhabi and when I am here I do that job as well.’</p>
      <p>He claimed a ban would be ‘exceptionally difficult’, adding: ‘I was disqualified 14 to 15 years ago but it was virtually impossible to get chauffeurs to come and pick me up at half five, six in the morning.</p>
      <p>‘In terms of hardship the last time I must have gone through five, six or seven chauffeurs – they didn’t want to do the time and meetings would run over.</p>
      <p>‘I was in London at Hotel Radisson with the HSBC and stayed until 10.30pm. It’s virtually impossible and business would suffer.’</p>

      <p>Russell told the court he would ‘need to pull out of several contracts and won’t be able to get around’.</p>
      <p>‘We’ve also got Brexit, a new Prime Minister and everyone’s anticipating the property market would drop off,’ he added.</p>
      <p>‘I can try restructure my hours to between 8.30am and 6.30pm but business would suffer and I would start to think of laying off the staff.</p>
      <p>‘I have tried before to take my staff with me on business but it doesn’t work and we still ended up getting chauffeurs and that doesn’t work either. It’s not a financial thing it’s just an impossible thing, just impossible.</p>
      <p>‘Mentally I am going to suffer – I’ve only had six points in 12 years. It’s not like I’m speeding everywhere in the car. A ban would affect my stress levels.’</p>
