      <h3>Thanks for care and kindness</h3>
      <p>On Thanksgiving morning I woke up feeling lousy. I was exhausted. Did my vital signs and saw a pulse of 38! I thought there was a chance I had a bug, and monitored the pulse all day.</p>
      <p>Tuesday and Wednesday were much the same. By Thursday noon I went to the Pasqua Hospital ER. After an ECG and giving the attending doctor my health history, I was moved to the Cardiac Surveillance Unit at Regina General Hospital, and on Friday morning had a pacemaker implanted.</p>
      <p>I want to thank all the wonderful medical staff in the Pasqua Hospital emergency room and the fine people at Regina General Hospital. All the people involved with my care; nurses, doctors and the EMS fellows who transported me between hospitals.</p>
      <p>Thank you very much for your first-class professional care, kindness and humour.</p>
      <p>And to the folks of Regina, you have first-class medical people and facilities in your fine city. And I’m a bilateral lung transplant recipient and know what first-class care is.</p>

      <h3>Let’s clarify voting reforms</h3>
      <p>I’ve read with interest the two recent opinion pieces taking opposing positions on reforming our voting system.</p>
      <p>One, by <a href="https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/boda-a-modern-democracy-needs-modern-tools/wcm/ed7e5c2e-f5b9-4324-8203-d06a7901b3fe">Dr. Michael Boda of Elections Saskatchewan on Oct. 26, puts forward a plan for gradual reform of the voting system.</a> Paper ballots would be preserved for the vast majority of voters. Electronic counting of those ballots (as has been used in some municipal elections in the province for some time) and electronic poll books would be gradually introduced. The goal is a more efficient and accessible electoral system using a mix of old and new technology.</p>
      <p>The other, by <a href="https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-if-it-aint-broke-dont-fix-it/wcm/86700bee-bc93-4351-8cb5-51c717d39fcd">Marjaleena Repo on Nov. 5, raises the danger of American-style voting machines and the problems encountered with internet voting</a>. She suggests that the Elections Saskatchewan plan would do away with paper ballots. To her, lineups do not dissuade people from voting and election workers should be easy to find. Reforming the voting system is unnecessary and the product of “myths” and “bottomless confidence in the latest technology.”</p>
      <p>Reading the two pieces, it’s difficult to believe that they are writing about the same set of changes or engaging with the same set of challenges.</p>
      <p>And this is worrisome — the process of voting is fundamental to our democracy and depends on citizens having a shared understanding of how the process works. I hope, as we continue to improve Saskatchewan’s voting system, we can commit to accurately understanding exactly what is on the table.</p>
