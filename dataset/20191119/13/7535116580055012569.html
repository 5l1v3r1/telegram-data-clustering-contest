      <p>Kids. No matter how much you love them, they can have their moments where the only word to describe them is annoying. That said, it’s no excuse to behave like this one raging Indonesian man who decided to be a stick in the mud.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/man-throws-rocks-at-kindergarten-in-bekasi-says-little-kids-singing-disturbed-his-rest/?fbclid=IwAR14gNspb-4JesvSLWN9kUgdgPJq7Af_9jTbQ1VFLLS5hFDiuDeAY2xsRno">Coconuts</a>, a kindergarten in Bekasi, West Java received a rain of stones after a guy who lived in the neighbourhood became so annoyed by the singing of the students that he started to throw rocks at the school.</p>

      <p>Cibarusah Police Chief Sukarman said in a statement that the event allegedly took place on Wednesday (Nov 13th) morning when a 38-year-old man known as Jaya walked up to the kindergarten in a rage.</p>
      <p>“The kids in the Islamic kindergarten were singing and learning. Then, a witness saw the culprit approach the school and throw rocks at it twice,”</p>
      <p>“The suspect shouted (possibly at a teacher), ‘You’re too noisy! You’re disturbing my rest!’”</p>

      <p>Sukarman stated that Jaya only threw rocks at the kindergarten’s fence, so the incident went by without anyone getting injured. It did scare the kids a little, but the teachers acted quickly and took the kids back inside their classroom to keep them safe.</p>
      <p>“No child was traumatised,” he said.</p>

      <p>Although the incident is still under investigation, Jaya may be charged for causing an unpleasant atmosphere under Indonesia’s criminal code, and he could receive a punishment of up to one year in prison.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for Jaya, the teacher who reported the incident to the police did not press charges against him. A local official said that both the suspect and a representative of the teachers will have a mediation session soon, and the kindergarten is ready to forgive Jaya as long as he promises not to repeat his outburst.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Maybe the man has never dealt with kids before or maybe he was really tired. Hopefully, both sides figure out a resolution!</i>
