      <h1>The Birmingham City report on Jefferson Montero that won't surprise Swansea City fans in the slightest</h1>
      <h2>Swans face Millwall this weekend and Montero memories are flooding back</h2>

      <p>Swansea City face Millwall this weekend and the match against The Lions brings to mind the game at The Den last season.</p>
      <p>Down to 10 men after Courtney Baker-Richardson's early, reckless red card, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea-city-fc">Swansea</a> fought back from 1-0 down to <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/millwall-1-2-swansea-city-15099955">grab all three points</a> in a stunning turnaround in south London.</p>
      <p>Central to the remarkable comeback was Jefferson Montero, who is spending the season on loan with Birmingham City.</p>
      <p>The Ecuadorian first set up Kyle Naughton before playing a crucial role in Oli McBurnie's scene-setting winner.</p>
      <p>"Montero, fabulous," Wyndham Evans <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDI2qBj1sh0">said on co-commentary</a> for the equaliser, before he absolutely lost it for the last-gasp decider from the Scotland international.</p>
      <p>"He should be playing for Real Madrid if he can play like that, I've got to be honest with you," Evans said of Montero. "That is class. That is top class."</p>
      <p>We all know what happened next. Montero did what he always does - he got injured. A brilliant start to the season fizzled out - first in South Wales, then in the Midlands with West Brom, who he joined on the last day of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>At The Hawthorns he endured a painful time and was reduced to just <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/painful-119-minutes-west-brom-16199759">119 minutes of football</a> in five months. Sadly, it was another campaign wrecked by injury.</p>
      <p>Steve Cooper was quick to make his mind up on Montero, who was shipped off to the Blues for the season. And with his Liberty Stadium contract expiring at the end of this term, he has more than likely played his last game for the Swans.</p>
      <p>We spoke to <b>Brian Dick</b> , Blues correspondent for <b>BirminghamLive</b> , who gave us a progress report on Montero. A great deal of the following won't surprise you in the slightest...</p>

      <p>"Montero was something of a surprise recruit when he arrived at St Andrew's with the club having tried to wean themselves off wingers in their summer overhaul," Brian says.</p>
      <p>"However, what was obviously lacking was pace - and he certainly brings that in abundance. So far he's played three times - twice off the bench and he was scintillating on both occasions - and once from the start, when he was carried off injured having made very little impact.</p>
      <p>"Pep Clotet will be desperate for more of the former and less of the latter. At the time the caretaker head coach said: 'Jefferson is a player who can guarantee crosses and he is dangerous one versus one. We need to use him so we maximise these kind of things. Jefferson is quick as well and the way he plays, it means we need a lot of focus on the defensive side to make sure you are controlling a game and he is effective. So, I see him playing in the front positions and as one of the wingers, using the rest of the team - especially a very flexible midfield - to be able to minimise his weaknesses and maximise his strengths'.</p>
      <p>"On his first appearance those strengths were there for all to see as he came off the bench against Barnsley and absolutely roasted his defender.</p>
      <p>"His third game was also as a sub against Fulham last time out; his 10-minute cameo was a highlight reel of beaten full-backs and crosses. However, his only start - against Stoke City - lasted half an hour and ended up with him being carried off, not to be seen again for two months.</p>
      <p>"Montero has definitely shown he has what it takes to be a massive influence on Blues' attacking game - but he needs to stay fit if he's going to have any chance of remaining at the club beyond the end of his loan move."</p>
      <p>Sound familiar? Montero's St Andrew's career is panning out as his Swansea one has; flashes of brilliance, regularly punctuated by injury. He's just one of those players.</p>
      <p>He's had 51 minutes of game-time so far this season. For football lovers - if not opposing full-backs - you hope he gets more as the campaign progresses.</p>
