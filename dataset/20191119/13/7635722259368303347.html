      <h1>Sweden drops investigation into rape allegation against Julian Assange</h1>

        <b>Prosecutors in Sweden say they have dropped their investigation into a rape allegation against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.</b>
      </p>
      <p>They said the evidence has "weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed since the events in question".</p>
      <p>Swedish authorities had been investigating allegations that Mr Assange had committed sexual offences in the country in 2010.</p>
      <p>The WikiLeaks founder spent almost seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy in London in a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden.</p>
      <p>He was ultimately arrested at embassy in April, and is currently serving a 50-week sentence for breaching jail conditions.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/uncategorized/sweden-reopens-assange-investigation-858577">Swedish authorities reopened their investigation</a></b> into the rape allegation against Mr Assange.</p>
      <p>In a statement today, Deputy Director of Public Prosecution Eva-Marie Persson confirmed officials have again decided to "discontinue their investigation".</p>
      <p>She said: "I would like to emphasise that the injured party has submitted a credible and reliable version of events. Her statements have been coherent, extensive and detailed.</p>
      <blockquote>"However, my overall assessment is that the evidential situation has been weakened to such an extent that that there is no longer any reason to continue the investigation."</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier this year, <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/julian-assange-extradition-hearing-871057">a judge in the UK ruled</a></b> that Mr Assange will face a full extradition hearing in February.</p>
      <p>The five-day process will decide whether Mr Assange will be sent to the US, where he faces computer hacking allegations.</p>
      <p>Authorities in the US claim thousands of secret and classified documents published on the WikiLeaks website “risked serious harm” to US national security.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for Mr Assange have labelled the charges against him a "threat" to all journalists.</p>
      <p>In a statement after today's decision by Swedish prosecutors, Kristinn Hrafnsson - WikiLeaks editor-in-chief - said: “Sweden has dropped its preliminary investigation into Mr Assange for the third time, after reopening it without any new evidence or information.</p>
      <p>"Let us now focus on the threat Mr Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment.”</p>
