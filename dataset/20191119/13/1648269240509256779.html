      <h1>2020 Buick Encore GX Makes Up To 155 HP, Gets Sport Touring Pack</h1>
      <h2>A CVT is the standard gearbox.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:06:04+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/anthony-alaniz/" target="_blank">Anthony Alaniz</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.motor1.com/buick/">Buick</a> confirmed today information reported on in August – a turbocharged 1.3-liter engine making 155 horsepower (115 kilowatts) will power the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/buick/encore-gx/">2020 Buick Encore GX</a>. There’ll be a smaller 1.2-liter engine available, too. <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/352084/2020-buick-encore-gx/">Buick revealed the GX earlier this year</a>, positioning it between the smaller Encore and larger Envision in a bid to expand its crossover lineup. However, Buick debuted the new crossover with little information about it. But now we know the powertrain choices.</p>
      <p>The standard powertrain will be a turbocharged 1.2-liter mill. Buick did not disclose its output, though. However, the 1.3-liter mill makes 155 hp and 174 pound-feet (235 Newton-meters) of torque. Both power the front wheels and will pair with a continuously variable transmission. </p>

      <p>However, all-wheel drive is an available option with the 1.3-liter engine, which also requires the nine-speed automatic gearbox. GM estimates the GX could return 31 miles per gallon combined, but official EPA numbers are pending.</p>
      <p>Buick also announced a Sport Touring package for the Encore GX, too. But it only adds a sporty appearance and nothing else. It features unique wheels, body-color surrounds, and a black mesh grille with red accents.</p>
      <p>Buick is also making the GX safe by including forward collision alert, automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist with lane departure warning, automatic high beams, and a follow distance indicator. Optional safety features include rear cross-traffic alert, rear park assist, rear camera mirror, adaptive cruise control, a head-up display, and more.</p>

      <p>The 2020 Buick Encore GX is set to arrive at dealerships early next year. When it arrives, it could be cheaper than the regular <a href="https://www.motor1.com/buick/encore/">Encore</a>, depending on the GX’s trim. A report earlier this month suggested the GX will start at $25,095, including the destination charge. While that’s more expensive than the Encore, it flips with the Preferred trims, which is $500 cheaper on the GX. Opting for the Encore GX Essence trim saves $800 over the Encore Essence.</p>
      <p>With the Encore GX set to arrive early next year, Buick should release detailed pricing information along with details about the smaller 1.2-liter engine in the coming months.</p>

          <i>Aldred added, “Filling the spot between the smaller Encore and the larger Envision and Enclave models, the Encore GX is another proof point that Buick is The Premium SUV Brand.

        <p>
          <i>Inside, the Encore GX embodies the quality cabin experience that Buick customers expect, including the brand’s signature QuietTuning, which helps to minimize road noise inside the vehicle, as well as premium materials and available features, like leather-appointed seats, a heated steering wheel and an ionizing air filter.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>The functional interior is designed to help you easily carry both passengers and cargo, with 94.3 cubic feet for passengers and 25.3 cubic feet for cargo<sup>6</sup> behind the second row. The Encore GX will have a standard, adjustable two-stage load floor, giving owners the flexibility for either more under-floor storage or a cargo floor that is level with the folded seats, depending on their specific needs.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>For even more flexibility, the Encore GX’s front passenger seat folds flat and the 40/60 folding second row is optimized with the narrower section behind the driver’s seat to better accommodate an 8-foot long object diagonally from the passenger seat to the rear driver’s side.</i>

        </p>
        <p>
