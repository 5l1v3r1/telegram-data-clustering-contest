      <h3>Pull- up</h3>
      <p>Pull-up is a strengthening exercise, which benefits one’s back, core and shoulder muscles. Depending on your grip your benefits of a pull-up exercise would be determined. If your palms are facing towards your body; then pull-up would impact your biceps and abs more than back; if your palms are facing outwards, then your back and abs will work-up more than your biceps. Here’s the step-by-step guide to a typical pull-up workout.</p>
      <p>· Hang yourself on a pull bar with straight arms.</p>
      <p>· Pull yourself up till you chin reaches the bar level.</p>
      <p>· Repeat this movement 10 times</p>
      <h3>Hand style plank</h3>
      <p>Hand style plank is just like regular plank, the only difference being in the hand grip. Instead of an open fist, you perform this exercise with your fists locked. This creates more tension in your core muscles. Because of high intensity, it is much harder to hold than a regular plank. In this plank variant, the body engagement is more than that of the regular version. Here’s your step-by-step guide.</p>
      <p>· Lie on your belly on the ground with your face down</p>
      <p>· Steady your forearms in a plank position</p>

      <p>· Bring your arms straight above your head, make a 90-degree angle with your knee and hips.</p>
