      <h1>Google Stadia game prices revealed – how does it compare?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:33:16+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author">Stefan L</a></address>
      <p>It’s launch day for Stadia, Google’s ambitious new game streaming service, and those taking delivery of their Founder’s Edition controller bundles today will be eagerly diving in to see how well the system holds up for them.</p>
      <p>Of course, you need games to enjoy on it, and while each Founder’s and Premiere Edition comes with three months of Stadia Pro included, that primarily gives you access to 4K streams and now two free games: Destiny 2: The Collection and (having been added yesterday) Samurai Shodown.</p>
      <p>For everything else, you’ll need to pay up. One of the most frustrating things about Google Stadia has been that it’s a closed box to non-subscribers. Can you browse the store out of idle curiosity? Can you heck. You need to download the apps, log in <i>and</i> have a Stadia invite key. Good.</p>
      <p>Google promised that their game prices would be comparable to other digital storefronts, and this seems to be the case as they announce the game prices for the games originally intended to be launch titles. Of course, they bumped those numbers up from 12 titles to 22 titles over the weekend, and the other 10 aren’t on the list. Great.</p>
      <p>Still, we can at least compare and contrast to other stores, though without access ourselves, only with the US pricing that Google have provided us. Fab.</p>

        <i>* Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition<br/>** PS+ Double Discount sale pricing</i>
      </p>
      <p>As you can see, the pricing matches up relatively consistently with the US region PlayStation and Xbox stores, though there are a few oddities. Final Fantasy XV is cheaper on Xbox One, but much more expensive on PlayStation 4, and this is the Royal Edition that I’m unsure of if it’s available on Stadia. Just Dance 2020 is just more expensive, full stop.</p>
      <p>Similarly, though there is Stadia Pro pricing – and all launch day buyers are in Stadia Pro by default for the first three months – the PS+ Double Discount sale in the US is a reminder that Black Friday is just around the corner, with prices for many of these games likely to be slashed on PlayStation and Xbox One.</p>
      <p>Oh, and all of this is without mentioning the regularly lower pricing of games at retail.</p>
      <p>We went hands on with Google Stadia just ahead of today’s launch, coming away with mixed feelings about the system. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/18/google-stadia-review-in-progress-streaming-latency-controller-hands-on/">Catch our hands on Stadia impressions here</a>. OK, then.</p>
