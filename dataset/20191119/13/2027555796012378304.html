      <h1>Nicolas Cage to star as Nicolas Cage in meta drama</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:16:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Hollywood star Nicolas Cage is in talks to play himself in meta drama "The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent".</p>
      <p>Tom Gormican is directing the Lionsgate project, reported Variety.</p>
      <p>Gormican has also co-written the script with Kevin Etten.</p>
      <p>If deals close, Cage would star as actor Nicolas Cage. The character is desperate to get a role in a new Tarantino movie while also dealing with a strained relationship with his teenage daughter. He also occasionally talks to an egotistical 1990s version of himself who rides him for making too many crappy movies and for not being a star anymore.</p>
      <p>The character is also under a lot of debt and finds himself forced to make an appearance at the birthday party of a Mexican billionaire who happens to be a fan of the actor's work and hopes to show him a script on which he has been working.</p>
      <p>The film will pay tributes to Cage's works such as "Leaving Las Vegas", "Face-Off" and "Gone in 60 Seconds".</p>
      <p>Cage will produce the project via his Saturn Films banner, alongside Mike Nilon and Kevin Turen.</p>
