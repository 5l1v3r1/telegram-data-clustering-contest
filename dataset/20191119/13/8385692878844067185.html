      <p>Today, in Best Buy's Daily Doorbusters leading up to Black Friday, it is shaving $100 off of the Lenovo IdeaPad 1. This is a 14-inch laptop that is now just $129. Now yes, usually laptops in this price range are pretty bad, and you shouldn't buy them. But this one is actually pretty good. Inside there is an AMD A6-9220E chipset, 4GB of RAM, AMD Radeon R4 graphics and of course a 14-inch display. It will also last for up to 8 hours of usage.</p>
      <p>Today, Best Buy is actually doing two Doorbuster deals with the other being this Western Digital Easystore 5TB External hard drive. This has a ton of storage, obviously, since it is a 5TB drive. Which means that you're going to have plenty of space for all of your files. And it's all for less than $90. This uses USB 3.0 so you are getting fast transfer speeds, but not USB-C connectivity, unfortunately.</p>
      <p>Amazon has the Roborock S5 robotic vacuum and mop on sale today in its Gold Box Deal of the Day. Allowing you to save big on this robot vacuum. It is down to just $359.99 today. That matches its all-time lowest price. This robot vacuum is heralded as one of the best robot vacuums out there, with it's laser precision mapping and impressive suction. It's no match for your pets hair.</p>

This is down from its regular price of $278. It also has some really good audio quality, thanks to that wireless sub that is going to give you some deep bass. And that sound bar that just sounds amazing. We all know that Sony knows audio.</p>
