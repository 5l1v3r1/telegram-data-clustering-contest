      <h1>Councils paid company £74k a month to house just six vulnerable children in care</h1>
      <h2>The company banked the amount from councils up and down the country for housing vulnerable kids in just one of his 19 properties</h2>

      <p>A housing company raked in £74,000-a-month from UK councils for providing supported accommodation for just six vulnerable children in care, according to the BBC.</p>
      <p>Teens placed in the 'unregulated home' in Birmingham claimed young residents were sometimes short of food and were not given bedding.</p>
      <p>Councils paid up to £28,000 per month for a child in care to be accommodated by Rodor Housing and Support Limited, based in Erdington, Birmingham, according to a BBC Newsnight investigation.</p>
      <p>It was claimed children as young as 15 lived in the Moseley house where they were given a small self-contained flat, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/company-boss-raked-74k-per-17265799">BirminghamLive</a> reports.</p>
      <p>But the firm denied 15 years olds lived there and said it has a foodbank for children and that its flats are fully equipped.</p>
      <p>It is not illegal for under 16s to live in unregistered homes, however such placements are discouraged by Ofsted.</p>
      <p>The Government has written to all council chief executives in England saying it want placements of under16s in supported accommodation elimiminated.</p>
      <p>According to experts that is because the homes are not generally set up to offer children care, only support.</p>
      <h3>Unsafe house</h3>
      <p>Former resident Paige Brookes, 18, from Walsall, told BirminghamLive she moved into the Rodor-owned house in Church Road, Moseley, Birmingham, when she was 16, and was not given bedding on her first night.</p>
      <p>"I had to call my boyfriend's dad who had to drive from Solihull to Birmingham at about 11pm and we had to drive around trying to find somewhere open to get bedding, pots, pans, cleaning stuff," she said.</p>
      <p>"The house itself was unsafe. There were no fire exits, no fire doors and there was a mouse infestation at one point."</p>

      <p>She added: "There were people kicking off, there’d be glass all down the steps from people who’d had fits and smashed things, there were people who used to sit on the steps and self harm</p>
      <p>"Rodor didn't listen to any complaints we made and it was a nightmare living there.</p>
      <p>"I felt really sorry for the younger ones who would often go hungry. There was even a 15-year-old in one of the homes living alongside older kids which is against the rules."</p>
      <p>Her council, Walsall, paid £2,000 per month for her to live in the house.</p>

      <h3>Council charged £22k a month for one child</h3>
      <p>She shared the house with a 16 year old from Cumbria - that council we understand paid nearly £16,000 per month.</p>
      <p>It was claimed a 15 year old from Hampshire was also housed at the property at a cost to her local council of around £18,000 per month.</p>
      <p>It is alleged living in an extension on the house was a 15 year old from London. Rodor is said to have charged his council around £22,000 per month.</p>
      <p>The highest charge was for a child who appears to have cost Bromley council more than £28,000 per month.</p>
      <p>Another looked-after-child aged 16, who lived in the house, featured in a BBC Newsnight investigation into supported accommodation.</p>
      <p>She claimed that she slept under a thin fleece blanket and her coat for her first 10 nights there.</p>
      <p>One or two support staff based in an office on the ground-floor minded the house in Church Road, Moseley, which accommodated up to six children.</p>
      <p>The girl, who cannot be named for safeguarding reasons, said she said she was expected to do her own food shopping and cooking yet had no pots, pans or cooking equipment and her only cutlery was an M&amp;S picnic fork.</p>
      <h3>Children "begged" for food</h3>
      <p>Newsnight heart that she claimed was so hungry that she begged staff for food. <br/><br/>There are now more than 5,000 looked-after-children living in "supported accommodation" - homes that provide support but not care and which do not have to be registered with, or inspected by, Ofsted. <br/><br/>This type of accommodation is deemed suitable for 16 and 17 year olds capable of transitioning to independence.</p>
      <p>However, Paige Brookes claimed she shared the home in Birmingham with at least two children under 16. <br/><br/>Rodor Housing and Support told BirminghamLive that all the flats were fully equipped with cooking equipment and bedding. <br/><br/>The firm's owner Marven Gabula denied that children under 15 lived in the house.</p>
      <p>Since Rodor Housing and Support started trading in 2014, the company has received more than £7m to house looked-after-children, according to analysis done by the Open Contracting Partnership and the Spend Network for Newsnight. <br/><br/>The number of children in Paige's house at any one time varied, but research suggests that in a good month, Rodor could earn £74,000 in fees for just six children. <br/><br/>"Local authorities would not agree to pay something they don't agree to," Mr Gabula said. <br/><br/>"No one is holding them at throat level. If local authorities want to look at varied options, they will look at varied options."</p>
      <h3>Racism</h3>
      <p>He added: "More than 75 councils across the country send their children here for me to look after and they can't all think I'm not doing a good job. <br/><br/>"I can put you in touch with a lot of people who had a successful time living in my properties and I have helped kids turn their lives around in some cases. <br/><br/>"I have done nothing illegal and I'm afraid the accusations levelled against me and my company are born out of racism." <br/><br/>Nottingham City Council, which is one of Rodor's biggest customers, said it had no concerns about the company. <br/><br/>Rodor Housing and Support operates around 20 supported accommodation properties in the West Midlands and Birmingham City Council was its biggest client until last year.</p>
      <p>However, the home Paige lived in Moseley has since closed following planning enforcement action by Birmingham City Council. <br/><br/>The council said it had been converted to flats without planning permission and was not signed off as safe by a building control officer.</p>
      <h3>What Birmingham City Council says</h3>
      <p>A spokeswoman from Birmingham City Council said: "Birmingham’s Children’s Trust has never placed children in care at this Moseley Road property.</p>
      <p>“Planning history does not reveal any permission for the use of the property as a HMO or supported accommodation. <br/><br/>"However, the property has been unlawfully converted into eight self-contained flats. As a result of this, the council has issued an enforcement notice requiring the property to be returned to its lawful use as a single family dwelling.</p>
      <p>"The owner has appealed the enforcement notice and the council currently awaits a start date for this appeal from the Planning Inspectorate.”</p>
