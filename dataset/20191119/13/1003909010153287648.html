      <h3>A better way to bag groceries</h3>
      <p>I just returned from a vacation in the Cook Islands. It is very pristine there. I brought my own shopping bags for groceries, but I did ask for a plastic bag to carry my meat in. They do some recycling, but not paper. However, they compost. The bag used to line the compost pail was the same as the plastic bag I paid for for my meat. On closer inspection, the writing on the plastic bag was a declaration that the bag was made of compostable plastic, as were the smaller bags used to put the loose produce into.</p>
      <p>So, perhaps our big panic to ban the plastic grocery bags could be better served by substituting the same compostable material. After all, companies are already selling us the bin liners, so the technology is in place. I would feel better knowing I could use the bags for my kitchen garbage, as they are the right size to line the bin, rather than having to purchase non-compostable ones. And it would still make sense to charge for these, as it is still better to bring your own bags, but not always practical for wet, drippy items.</p>

      <h3>Public education cuts affect student learning</h3>
      <p>All the recent publicity on education cuts and blame to teachers seems misguided. For the last six years, teachers have agreed to basically zero per cent increases to their base salary, recognizing the economic problems. As a teacher, I would be fine with another three years of zero per cent increases to help balance the budget; however, a rollback to my salary is just insulting.</p>
      <p>The attack on public education by the UCP is clear if you look close enough. Private schooling funding went up from $286,000 (2018/19) to $291,000 (2019/2020), while the UCP slashed grants for public education that cut overall public spending. The Choice in Education Act will only further take money from public education. Every cut made to public funding, whether or not it affects front line staff, will affect student learning in the classroom. To make these cuts midway through a school year is truly absurd.</p>

      <h3>Renewables not the be-all and end-all</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Transition from coal could jump to renewables, Opinion, Nov. 16</b>
      </p>
      <p>Binnu Jeyakumar makes a case for displacing coal generation with wind and solar based on economics. There are several reasons why this cannot be done. We all know when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine, the generation will be zero. Battery backup is great but the backup has to last weeks. Battery backup for this length of time would be extremely expensive. So renewables have to be backed up with a predictable source of power. The consumer ends up paying for the capital cost twice, once for renewables and once for the backup, hidden in the cost of generation. Typically, in Alberta, this backup will be natural gas-fired generation.</p>
      <p>The second reason, and almost always overlooked issue, is renewables do not have the inertia of large generators and make grid stability an issue. Most grids cannot tolerate more than about 15 per cent of renewable generation.</p>
      <p>Renewables can play a role in Alberta’s grid by backing off existing natural gas and coal-fired generators, not displacing them so that the inertia is still in the system. Alberta will have to look to nuclear power generation in the coming years.</p>
