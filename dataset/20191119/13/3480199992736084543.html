      <p>Global Citizen is an international advocacy group that supports sustainable development goals set by the United Nations.</p>
      <p>The group’s mission is to end world poverty by 2030.</p>
      <p>The Global Citizen Prize will be recognised across five categories, including a youth leadership award, which honours an individual aged 18 to 30 who has contributed meaningfully towards the goal of ending extreme poverty.</p>
      <p>The prize includes 250,000 US dollars (£193,327) to be paid to the organisation through which the winner has achieved impact.</p>
      <p>There will be a public vote open in all countries up to and including November 26 which will go towards determining the winner of the youth leadership prize.</p>
      <p>The ceremony will also include a business leader prize, given to an individual in the business community who has combined business goals with positive human impact, and a Global Citizen of the Year accolade, which honours someone who has proven exceptional and sustained impact towards the goal of ending extreme poverty.</p>
      <p>The new event is the first major event of Global Citizen’s 2020 campaign to “get the world back on track” to achieve the UN’s Global Goals by 2030.</p>
      <p>The ceremony will air on Saturday December 21 at 7pm on Sky.</p>
