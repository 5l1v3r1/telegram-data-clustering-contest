      <p><b>Lucknow</b><b>:</b> A fresh FIR has been registered here against real estate giant, Ansal API Group over a case of alleged fraud and criminal breach of trust. This is the same matter in which Uttar Pradesh Minister Swati Singh had asked the Cantonment police circle officer to quash the case. The audio of the conversation had gone viral and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath pulled up the minister for this. In the FIR lodged here at the PGI police station on Sunday, the complainant Deepti Kannuadia has accused Ansal API of accepting over Rs 30 lakhs through cheques for booking a 240 square metre plot in its Sushant Golf City project on Shaheed Path, Lucknow. However, the plot has not been given to the buyer even after a period of eight years. In her complaint, Deepti has accused the group’s chairman, Sushil Ansal, his son and vice-chairman of the group, Pranav Ansal, and two other authorities — Sushil Singh and Arun Mishra.  (IANS)</p>
