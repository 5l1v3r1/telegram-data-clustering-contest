      <p>The plight of young people (pictured) who grew up in care and who lose support from the state when they turn 18 – "Tossed out on the street to survive alone" (The Age, 19/11) – is a huge problem. Some people argue that this care should continue until they are 21.</p>

      <p>However, what your article highlights is the lack of decent, affordable housing and an appropriate transition program for these young people. Couple this with the low Newstart allowance and we are forcing them into homelessness and poverty. It is time the federal government increased Newstart and the Victorian government provided more social housing units and support programs for these young people.</p>

      <h4>A few more years to help them become independent</h4>
      <p>I wonder if there could be a scheme whereby families whose children have left home could offer to host a young person (who grew up in the care of the state) for one to three years until they have found their feet. The cases in your article concerned those who were studying and working hard to improve their lives. Enabling them to connect with families who would be willing to host them, and help them become independent, could provide a better start in life than extended care homes.</p>

      <h4>Older workers pay the price of tax cuts for wealthy</h4>
      <p>Josh Frydenberg says "the new dynamic" in the way our population is ageing will require new policies to ensure the nation's heavy lifting is not left to a diminishing number of younger people (The Age, 19/11). His solution: people in their mid and late 60s should continue to work to stimulate the economy so that services such as education, health and welfare will be funded in the future.</p>
      <p>Translation: As a government, we would like to see older people who have paid taxes all their lives continue to work longer so we can deliver the tax cuts to the wealthy as promised. Because woe that they should have to pay their fair share.</p>

      <h4>Too often, older workers are overlooked for jobs</h4>
      <p>I applaud Josh Frydenberg's effort to keep people who want to work in jobs for longer, but his fine intentions belie his disconnection from the workforce. Ageism is rampant, as well it might be when generation after generation of fresh talent comes through wanting their turn, which is fair enough.</p>
      <p>However, structural changes occur across many sectors, meaning workers lose their skills base and employers advertise for "junior", "entry-level" and "graduate" roles that ask for far more experience than should be expected at the low salaries they are offering.</p>
      <p>The problem of ageism will become the great challenge of our time if older workers (I am talking about people as young as mid-40s) continue to be moved on or are overlooked by employers who are trying to save money and improve their bottom line.</p>

      <h4>My working life turned on its head at the age of 70</h4>
      <p>Josh Frydenberg, aged 70, I was happily employed doing a Department of Human Services project entitled Creating Opportunities for Mature Age Employees, until I was run over by a careless driver while walking to my workplace.</p>
      <p>I suffered multiple, serious injuries. But the worst suffering was, firstly, the age discrimination which existed in the Transport Accident Commission's "loss of earnings benefit and loss of income and employment compensation" scheme. Secondly, and even more cruelly, the financial abuse perpetrated by Centrelink in appropriating my "pain and suffering and loss of income compensation" payment. Despite by then being 74, Centrelink treated me as if I were a 40-year-old who, regardless of her permanent injuries, could return to work and recoup her lost earnings, superannuation and other benefits. So, Treasurer, address those inequities against older workers first and I might be able to complete that project.</p>

      <h3>THE FORUM</h3>
      <h4>In praise of introversion</h4>
      <p>If indeed bosses are choosing noisy, extroverted types for higher level jobs (Comment, 18/11), it could be a big mistake. Sure, some extroverted people may be better at managing unruly meetings where people speak out of turn. But even an introverted person can learn methods to handle that. And as Gary Martin notes, introverts are often more skilled at the extended, one-on-one meeting along with dozens of other good qualities. I wonder where this unproductive hiring practice arose. It may well have cost many companies billions of dollars by choosing the least suitable candidates for important roles.</p>

      <h4>Positive male role models</h4>
      <p>There has been a real effort to encourage more females into male-dominated occupations which, quite rightly, has had substantial community acceptance. These industries include the trades, engineering and IT.</p>
      <p>"Men disappearing from classroom" (The Age, 18/11) highlights the gender imbalance in schools. The Department of Education's response – "We recruit teachers based on their merit. Gender is not a factor" – is disappointing. Is gender balance only a one-way situation? In this era of increased domestic violence, young children and adolescents would benefit by having regular contact with male teachers who could provide positive role models in behaviour and attitude. We need strategies to increase the number of male teachers, especially in the early years of schooling</p>

      <h4>We need a vision</h4>
      <p>Our community cannot afford another Hazelwood-type closure – "Unions urge Yallourn closure deal" (The Age, 19/11). We need all governments and councils to work with transitioning communities to create a vision and jobs. Rather then be pushed away from coal, we need to build lifeboats. We ned to create a national transition association involving workers and communities. Many people across Australia fear what will happen to their communities as the market moves them away from coal. Let us create a plan before it is too late.</p>

      <h4>Jobs in renewable energy</h4>
      <p>The Victorian Energy Policy Centre has warned that if Alcoa's Portland smelter were to close, it could hasten the demise of coal-fired generators in the Latrobe Valley – "Higher night power prices to ease peak" (The Age, 19/11). Perhaps we should look at this differently. If the smelter were powered by renewable energy, it could also hasten the demise of coal power – and that would be good. This would save Portland jobs and create many more in building the renewable energy facilities. Certainly the short-term costs would be high, but as the world moves towards sustainable energy, coal-fired aluminium production will die anyway. Furthermore, the cost of wind and solar energy continues to fall.</p>

      <h4>Controlled burning is...</h4>
      <p>While controlled burning of the bush may "mitigate the effects of fires, their intensity, capacity to spread uncontrollably and resources required to fight them in extremis" as Mike Seward maintains (Letters, 18/11), this seems a backward practice in these times.</p>
      <p>It is increasingly difficult to find safe times for burning, as the fire season has become longer. Plus the costs are very high. Like land clearing, control burning reduces vegetation at a time when we need every hectare we have of trees and bush to slow climate change. And burning forests means the release of greenhouse gasses, adding to global warming.</p>
      <p>Perhaps it would be better to approach the issue from a town planning perspective: Is this area safe enough for housing to be sited there? Should more housing be permitted? And if housing already exists, can we add extra escape routes in various directions?</p>

      <h4>...not a simple matter</h4>
      <p>The Wilsons Promontory bushfire of April 2005 was initiated by a "controlled burn" but instead turned into a wildfire. Eleven days later it had destroyed 6880 hectares. In contrast, the 2009 bushfire began with a lightning strike on April 8, and was left to burn for three months. At the time, the relevant state authority claimed a controlled back burn was too risky, especially as "no valuable assets" were threatened.</p>
      <p>It is disturbing that native animals were not seen as a valuable asset. The impact of both fires on native animals was horrific, with the estimated loss of hundreds of wombats, koalas, wallabies, echidnas and emus. So let us take the risk of bushfires in Victoria seriously, but also be mindful that controlled burns are not a simple matter.</p>

      <h4>Climate change and 'sin'</h4>
      <p>I am sorry, Israel Folau, but you are wrong. God paid me a visit and told me to pass on this message to you: droughts and fires are divinely ordained features of our landscape, and have been for millennia. The abolition of gay marriage and cessation of abortion would not alter this by one iota.</p>
      <p>No, what God is fuming about are your many lurid tattoos. You flaunt them in flagrant disobedience to His divine command in Leviticus 19:28. You must repent of this grievous sin, have them removed by a doctor (expensive, but hey, you can afford it) and then enrol with the Westboro Baptist Church in the United States, a gang of like-minded chosen favourites who also think they can link meteorological conditions to the sins of others.</p>

      <h4>Think of your families</h4>
      <p>Freedom of speech is often controversial, especially when it is done by outspoken individuals who are politicians and celebrities. Israel Folau and Prince Andrew have both demonstrated that you can hang yourself in public with your own words. It is time that some of them stepped away from public life and stopped embarrassing themselves as it has severe ramifications for their own families.</p>

      <h4>Why his God is so angry</h4>
      <p>If Israel Folau's God was so upset about abortion and same-sex marriage, why did he/she/it take so long to react? Can Folau demonstrate that there is the connection he claims? I doubt it and until he does, he is talking through an orifice devoid of a mandible. I have an alternate explanation. The disasters Folau refers to are God's punishment for him being an insensitive homophobe.</p>

      <h4>Double standard on rights</h4>
      <p>"Brutal" detention, incarceration, deaths in custody, controversial killings and internationally scandalous rates of detention etc – "'Merciless' assault on Muslims revealed" (The Age, 18/11). Unfortunately it sounds all too familiar. I find it extraordinarily hypocritical of us as a nation to be preaching to anyone about human rights.</p>

      <h4>Welcome Hongkongers</h4>
      <p>Hong Kong once had the Union Jack in the corner of its flag. I reason that the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and other countries of our Commonwealth have a duty to offer prioritised emigration and political asylum to the people of Hong Kong. I wonder if our government would welcome people who are prepared to put their lives on the line for democracy and freedom.</p>

      <h4>Will China lose patience?</h4>
      <p>The fact the protests are now in their sixth month in Hong Kong is testament to Hong Kongers' belief that their democracy is under threat from mainland China.</p>
      <p>My daughter is resident in Hong Kong. She teaches English to private students and says her student numbers have decreased as most are unwilling to leave their homes at night, fearful of indiscriminate tear-gas attacks. Apparently word on the street is that the mainland police have infiltrated the Hong Kong Police Force and are the main cause of the escalating violence, angry student protesters aside.</p>
      <p>My daughter is not afraid to remain in Hong Kong. It seems most Hongkongers believe mainland China needs their home more than Hong Kong needs mainland China, which they believe will keep stronger action in check for the time being.</p>
      <p>How much longer can protesters maintain the momentum? Mainland China must be asking the same question. Meanwhile, I hope my daughter remains safe, never to witness China's wrath reigning upon Hong Kong when it loses patience with the protesters.</p>

      <h4>A cruel half-life existence</h4>
      <p>How is it possible that a man with an acquired brain injury, unfit to stand trial, is sent to jail and remains there for three years (The Age, 16/11)? Answer: Because it is too easy for the responsible department to shut the door on him and too expensive to design "one-off" supports appropriate for his needs.</p>
      <p>Fifty years ago, Veterans Affairs advised my brother, a young soldier who had been critically injured in battle in Vietnam, his brain filled with shrapnel and limbs twisted and useless, that there was "nowhere" to care for him, and sent him home to his ageing parents. After the family broke down, he was sent to live in a locked dementia ward with orderlies providing "care". For 15 years he endured beatings, illness and despair because the only response he could draw on was to shout profanities and lash out.</p>
      <p>Nothing has changed. As a society, our values ensure the "sacredness" of saving lives under any circumstances, yet the very few people with catastrophic acquired brain injury who do survive are condemned to a half-life existence and treated with cruel indifference.</p>
      <p>It it possible to design appropriate care for those few. However, it is expensive and our values are eroding in terms of individual rights for some minority groups, such as people with severe and multiple disabilities. It is just "too hard" and the will is not there to rectify these terrible injustices.</p>
