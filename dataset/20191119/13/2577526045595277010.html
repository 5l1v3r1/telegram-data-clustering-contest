      <h1>Amy Hennig Will Head Up Skydance Media's New Interactive Division</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:30:47+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>Former <i>Uncharted</i> creative director Amy Hennig has joined film company <a href="https://skydance.com/">Skydance Media</a> to head up its new game studio. An announcement yesterday confirmed that Hennig and executive partner Julian Beak will be responsible for creating a new interactive division within the company.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/18/skydance-media-taps-amy-hennig-to-launch-new-game-studio-for-story-based-games/">Venturebeat</a>, Hennig said that the new company won’t focus exclusively on traditional videogame markets, but will instead craft an “interactive series,” reportedly similar in style to Uncharted.</p>
      <p>Best known for her work on the first three games in Naughty Dogs’ classic series, Hennig moved on to EA, where she worked on a Star Wars game developed by Visceral. The publisher eventually shut down the studio and cancelled the game, at which point Hennig left the company, taking time to look around the industry for her next project.</p>
      <p>Skydance, founded in 2010, is best known for its action blockbusters. Current projects include <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> and next year’s new Top Gun film, while the studio has previously worked on Star Trek, World War Z, G.I. Joe, and Mission: Impossible films. In recent years, it has also created two VR games, including a spin-off of The Walking Dead.</p>
      <p>There’s no concrete information regarding what Hennig and Beak’s team will be working on, but Henning did say that “what we’re describing is more focused on some of these massive, triple-A blockbusters.” That said, there’ll also be attention paid to “authored narrative” - “that is what we are missing, the kind of shorter form, focused, narrative interactive content.” Whatever the new team comes out with, however, is probably still many years away - maybe keep an eye on E3 2022...</p>
