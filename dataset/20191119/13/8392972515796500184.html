      <p>Fans have branded <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/michelle-keegan/">Michelle Keegan</a> "unrecognisable" in a new photograph she shared to social media.</p>
      <p>Our Girl star Michelle uploaded a shot of herself holding her cute four-legged friend to Instagram.</p>
      <p>In the picture, she is wearing a zip-up leather corset-style top, with her long brunette hair flowing in loose waves.</p>

      <p>However, fans admitted they had to do a double take and "look twice at her name" before they realised it was her.</p>

      <p>Tagging a friend, one follower said: "Look how different she looks?"</p>
      <aside>Look how different she looks? Doesn't even look like her any more.</aside>
      <p>"Exactly my thoughts," one user responded.</p>
      <p>"Doesn't even look like her any more," said another.</p>

      <p>"I didn’t even recognise this as you," said another of former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Corrie</a> star Michelle's followers.</p>
      <p>"Blimey this looks nothing like you!!" said another.</p>

      <p>However, others called Michelle "hot" and "stunning" and asked her for make-up tips.</p>
      <p>Her husband, former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/reality-tv/the-only-way-is-essex/">TOWIE</a> star Mark Wright, certainly seemed to approve of Michelle's look, simply commenting with the flame emoji.</p>
