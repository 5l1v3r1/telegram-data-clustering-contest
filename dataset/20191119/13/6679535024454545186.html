      <p>YSR Congress Party MLAs Botsa Appala Narasayya, Sambangi China Venkata Appala Naidu, Aljangi Joga Rao and P. Rajanna Dora on Tuesday strongly defended the move to introduce English medium education in government schools saying that it would benefit the poor and downtrodden children. They alleged that the Opposition parties were misleading people by linking the medium of education with religion.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media here, Mr. Rajannadora said that his children studied in missionary schools but remained as Hindus. “Jana Sena Party leader Pawan Kalyan is trying to mislead people with his statements while forgetting that all his children are studying in English medium schools,” he added.</p>
      <p>Mr. Appala Narasayya said that poor families would get relief from hefty fees collected by private schools with the introduction of English medium in government schools.</p>
