      <p>With the number of passengers who used the self bag drop kiosks crossing the half million mark in October, Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru is looking to expand the service to other airlines.</p>
      <p>According to the airport officials, on an average, nearly 2,500 passengers avail this facility each day. “The Air.Go fully-automated Self Bag Drop machines, are currently available for passengers flying with Air Asia and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/spice-smartphone/">Spice</a> Jet. This would be expanded to more airlines in the future,” the airport management said in the media release on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Launched in 2018 to reduce check-in queues, the Bengaluru Airport was the first in the country to introduce fully automated baggage drop-off points.</p>

      <p>The Self Bag Drop has a two-step approach. A passenger will first print a boarding pass and an eezee-tag (bag tag) at a self-check-in kiosk.  After tagging the bag, the passenger will then proceed to the bag drop machine and scan the boarding pass to initiate the bag drop process. The bag will be measured, weighed, scanned and automatically fed into the baggage handling system.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Bengaluru airport has deployed Digi Buddies to assist passengers using digital processing systems such as Self Bag Drop, Biometric-based Self Boarding and Smart Security Lane.</p>
