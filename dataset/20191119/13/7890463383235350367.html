      <h1>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order update released; here are the patch notes and fixes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:04:49+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:04</time> by <a rel="author">Carrie Talbot</a></address>
      <p>
        <b>Now that <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> has arrived, the first <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FallenOrder/comments/dy8ip5/star_wars_jedi_fallen_order_patch_notes_wc_nov_18/">patch</a> for the game is also here, bringing some fixes and tweaks to address a handful of quirks. The update isn’t huge, but tackles things like texture flickering, arrow key input, and “longer than expected loading times.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order patch addresses four aspects of the game. First up is a fix to stop texture flickering that can happen when you drive the giant, four-legged combat vehicle, the AT-AT, on Kashyyyk. The patch notes also say that “Dynamic resolution settings will now save properly.”</p>
      <p>In a broader fix, the patch also solves an issue where the game can slow down and loading times become “longer than expected,” so hopefully any players that might have experienced this so far can now get stuck into Cal Kestis’ Jedi action with full <i>force</i>. Get it?</p>
      <p>Last but not least, the patch also fixes a hiccup that meant arrow key inputs were sometimes not registering in the game’s menus. Lovely.</p>

      <p>According to the patch notes, the update is only released for PC at the moment, but Xbox One and PlayStation 4 players can expect a patch to follow later this week, too.</p>

Our very own Rich Scott-Jones says: “Gameplay is solid from the start and gains depth, transforming you into a Jedi badass,” with developer Respawn having “nailed the Star Wars universe” for better and for worse.</p>
