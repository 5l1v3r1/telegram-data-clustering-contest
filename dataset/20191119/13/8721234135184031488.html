      <h1>Quantum-technology programmes in UK, China and Russia are described by top physicists</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:04:45+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://physicsworld.com/author/hamish-johnston/" target="_blank">Hamish Johnston</a></address>
      <p>Quantum-technology initiatives in Russia, China and the UK are the subjects of three different articles in the journal <i><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2058-9565">Quantum Science and Technology</a></i>, which has put together a special <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2058-9565/page/Focus_on_quantum_science_and_technology_initiatives_around_the_world">Focus on Quantum Science and Technology Initiatives Around the World</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/ab4346">UK report</a> is by <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/p.knight">Peter Knight</a> and <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/leadership-and-strategy/provost/about-the-provost/">Ian Walmsley</a> of Imperial College London and describes how more the £1bn in government and industry funding has been committed to developing quantum technologies in the period 2014-2024. The UK’s National Quantum Technology Programme and its research and skills hubs at universities throughout the country are also described.</p>
      <p>Russia’s efforts to develop quantum technologies are described in a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/ab4472">report</a> by 14 physicists at the <a href="http://prev.rqc.ru/">Russian Quantum Center</a> in Moscow and several other institutes. The authors point out that the country is in the process of adopting a five-year Russian Quantum Technologies Roadmap as part of the nation’s Digital Economy National Program. The final budget for the quantum technologies portion of this initiative is expected to be about €1bn.</p>

      <p>A report written by five physicists at the <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of China</a> including <a href="https://quantum.ustc.edu.cn/web/en/node/32">Jian-Wei Pan</a> points out that China has spent nearly $1bn on quantum-technology research and development over the past decade. This includes the launch of the Micius quantum-communications satellite, which was launched in 2016.</p>
      <p>The three reports follow on from reviews on the states of quantum technologies in <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/quantum-computing-initiatives-worldwide-are-examined-by-leading-physicists/">Canada, the EU, Japan, the US and Australia</a> – which were published earlier this year.</p>
