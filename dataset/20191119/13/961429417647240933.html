      <p>The East Midlands acute trust appointed David Selwyn to the role, who will start on 9 December.</p>
      <p>Dr Selwyn is a consultant in adult critical care medicine and anaesthesia and is currently deputy medical director at SFH.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the trust’s former medical director <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/hsj-local/ics-medical-director-appointed-executive-lead/7025997.article">Andy Haynes stepped down</a> to join the Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Integrated Care System on an interim basis for 12 months.</p>
      <p>Dr Haynes had been deputy chief executive and medical director since 2014.</p>
      <p>SFH chief executive Richard Mitchell said of the appointment: “Dr Selwyn will be an excellent addition to the executive team and I have really enjoyed getting to know him and working with him over the last couple of months whilst he has been on secondment at SFH in the deputy medical director role.”</p>
      <p>Dr Selwyn said: “I would like to pay tribute to the exceptional work that Andy Haynes has achieved during his time [and] am excited to build on and further develop these achievements as we continue to work together to establish better outcomes and healthy lifestyles for our patients across the Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Integrated Care System.”</p>
