        <b>Every motorist knows the frustration of being stuck behind a slow tractor.</b>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Thus begins the description of the site of the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/11/guy-martin-reaches-135-mph-to-obliterate-the-worlds-fastest-tractor-record-598759?fbclid=IwAR0J5p1Nln57pj2-SrnLhv2OcWAC82_Ocd533lvd4Y-efy1IoLipj-sursU">Guinness Book of Records,</a> which continues: there’s no danger of that happening here though. British enginnering firm JCB has made the world’s fastest tractor (modified), and who better to drive it than lorry mechanic, motorcycle racer and thrill seeker Guy Martin.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Guy already has records for the the fastest speed on a gravity-powered snow sled (134.368 km/h 83.49 mph), the fastest soapbox (137.78 km/h 85.61 mph) and highest speed on a Wall of Death (25.77 km/h 78.15 mph).</b>
      </p>
      <p>For his latest attempt, Guy was to take on the challenge of setting a new tractor speed record not once but twice, at the wheel of a JCB Fastrac (usual top speed, 41 mph).</p>
      <p>He initially achieved a new record of 166.79 km/h (103.64 mph) before going even faster by reaching 217.570 km/h (135.191 mph).</p>
      <p>What can we say? Absolute myth!</p>
