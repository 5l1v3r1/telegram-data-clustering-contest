      <p>A message just received from the school principal of Monte Vista Elementary School:</p>
      <p>
        <i>Lockout ALL ARE SAFE, and there is no danger on campus.<br/>Â <br/>Dear parents,<br/>We are currently in a lockdown that I called because a stranger on campus refused to leave. He has subsequently left to the park. The police are here and will not dismiss anyone to the park until we get the all clear.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Please remain off campus until you get the all clear message.</i>
