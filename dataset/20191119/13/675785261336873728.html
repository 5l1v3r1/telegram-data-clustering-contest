      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:32:50+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:32</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p>Virgin Voyages' new cruise ship will be called Valiant Lady - and the cruise line has offered sailors a sneak peek with the first renderings of the exterior.</p>
      <p>The second ship for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/richard-branson">Sir Richard Branson</a> 's new cruise line, Valiant Lady is set to make her big debut in May 2021.</p>
      <p>The ship's name has been inspired by the Latin word 'valere' and the French origin 'vaillant', meaning bold, strong and courageous.</p>
      <p>Historically the image of women has graced just the bows of ships to protect the vessels, but Valiant Lady will embody "the idea that women design, captain, lead and champion change in the maritime industry".</p>
      <p>As for her itineraries?</p>
      <p>Valiant Lady will home port in Barcelona, from where she will sail on seven-night itineraries across France, Italy and Spain. Oh, and all of the itineraries will include a glamorous overnight stay in Ibiza.</p>

      <p>Tom McAlpin, CEO of Virgin Voyages, said: "We are thrilled to unveil the name of our second ship - Valiant Lady - and to deliver on our commitment to offer travelers a sea change in how they can experience cruising in this fantastic part of the world.</p>

      <p>"Our Sailors will fall in love with the places we go and the moments and memories they will be able to create on our gorgeous ship. After all, there is no better way to sail the seven seas than doing it the Virgin way."</p>
      <p>Valiant Lady is the second ship unveiled by the cruise line. The first ship is Scarlet Lady, one of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/cruises/new-cruise-ships-2020-excited-20361961">highly-anticipated ships for 2020</a> .</p>
      <p>The ship, which boasts a gross tonnage of 110,000, won't be offering a traditional cruise holiday experience; instead, sailors will find vegan menus, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/cruises/virgins-new-cruise-ship-host-13556088">drag-inspired brunches</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/cruises/geri-horner-hosts-first-tour-16542096">rockstar-themed suites</a> , and even an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/cruises/virgin-voyages-new-ship-getting-13441044">onboard tattoo parlour</a> .</p>
      <p>Other highlights include a 220 square foot area of triple netting where guests can lay out and soak up the rays, right above the ocean and the decks below and cosy cabanas where you can take in ocean views.</p>
      <p>The launch of Valiant Lady will also continue the cruise line's 'Scarlet Squad' program which aims at recruiting, supporting and mentoring female shipboard talent, as well as growing opportunities to access leadership roles.</p>
