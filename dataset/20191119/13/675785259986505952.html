      <h1>John Terry responds to claims he blocked Chelsea transfer for Sergio Aguero</h1>
      <h2>Chelsea considered a deal to take Sergio Aguero to Stamford Bridge in 2009, three years before he made his big-money move to Manchester City</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:08:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:08</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>John Terry has dismissed claims he urged Chelsea not to sign Sergio Aguero before his move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> had reportedly considered Aguero in the summer of 2009 as they looked to add some youth to an ageing attack of Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka.</p>
      <p>Chelsea made enquiries about Aguero's availability but were put off by Atletico Madrid's Â£40m valuation.</p>
      <p>The two sides met in the Champions League the following season and <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1383439/2019/11/18/why-chelsea-missed-out-on-signing-aguero-despite-making-him-a-target-in-2009/?redirected=1&amp;redirected=1">the Athletic reports</a> skipper Terry was not convinced by the Argentine, and advised the Chelsea board against the transfer.</p>

      <p>Terry, now assistant boss at Aston Villa, has taken to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to deny the suggestions.</p>
      <p>"Where do these get the stories from? If they bothered calling players agents it would solve an awful lot of nonsense!"</p>
      <p>Terry is said to have favoured a move for David Villa instead but Aguero has since moved to England and enjoyed a stunning career at Manchester City.</p>
      <p>He is the club's record goalscorer and sits sixth in the list of all-time goals in the Premier League, with 173.</p>

      <p>Manchester City return to action this weekend as they bid to claw the gap back on leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>They welcome Frank Lampard's high-flying side to the Etihad, sitting fourth in the table.</p>
      <p>Aguero was out of sorts in the defeat at Anfield before the international break and could be replaced by Gabriel Jesus.</p>
