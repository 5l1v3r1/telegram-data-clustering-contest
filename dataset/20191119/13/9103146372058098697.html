        <b>Dear Counsellor,</b>
      </p>
      <p>My husband is sketchy with his whereabouts and, for example on weekends, he does not communicate where he spends his time. Once in a while, I get to hear friends saying they were with him at functions he did not tell me about. I am not tight-marking him, but I believe spouses should always endeavour to update each other on their whereabouts. Am I wrong?</p>
