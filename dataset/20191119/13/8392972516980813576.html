      <p>Presenter Kate Garraway has shocked <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> viewers by revealing the nickname she uses for her private parts.</p>
      <p>Viewers were thrilled last night (18.11.19) as the show treated them to the first bushtucker trial of the series, putting Good Morning Britain's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway">Kate</a> and American reality star <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/bookies-make-caitlyn-jenner-early-favourite-to-win-im-a-celebrity/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> up high in boxes filled with nasties.</p>

      <p>The aim of the game was to win as many stars as possible for their camp by dropping coloured balls into a moving bucket.</p>
      <p>In typical I'm A Celeb fashion, both women had to endure being swarmed by rats and thousands of creepy crawlies.</p>

      <p>Kate was struggling to concentrate on the balls and began to panic as she felt the bugs crawling up her "noo noo".</p>
      <p>She screamed: "Don't go up my noo noo! They're going up my noo!"</p>
      <p>When the camera cut to hosts <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Dec Donnelly</a>, the latter could only stand looking awkwardly at the camera.</p>

      <p>Kate said it again when the task had ended and Dec joked that crew member Bob needed to "bring the other tweezers".</p>
      <p>Viewers reacted to the revelation on Twitter, with one tweeting: "Not everyday you hear Kate Garraway saying she got one in the noo noo."</p>
      <aside>They're going up my noo!</aside>
      <p>Someone else wrote: "Who the chuff calls their tuppence a noo noo?! #KateGarraway #ImACeleb."</p>
      <p>A third said: "'Why they going up my noo noo?' Kate, sweetheart they are bugs, I'm pretty sure they don't wanna go there, they just trying to get away from ya."</p>
      <p>Another commented: "Nothing worse than a cockroach up your noo noo I bet!"</p>

      <p>Caitlyn also had to deal with an insect in an orifice - and when the task ended, needed brief medical attention.</p>
      <p>The former Olympian feared there was a bug in her ear and a member of the team had to come and flush it out with a syringe.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere in the second episode, radio DJ Roman Kemp moved his campmates and viewers at home as he spoke about his parents.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old also opened up about his parents' long and happy friendship with late singer George Michael, who was Roman's godfather.</p>
      <p>But it was <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/ronan-kemp-melts-im-a-celebrity-viewers-hearts-with-tragic-details-about-his-family/">his stirring tribute to Spandau Ballet dad Martin Kemp</a> that visibly moved the likes of Kate Garraway, Nadine Coyle and Myles Stephenson.</p>
