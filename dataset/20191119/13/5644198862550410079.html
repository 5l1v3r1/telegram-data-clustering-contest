      <p>SINGAPORE: Scammers have deceived victims into giving away details of their credit card, debit card or bank accounts by saying they had won lucky draws organised by Changi Airport Group (CAG).</p>
      <p>In an advisory released on Tuesday (Nov 19), police said victims lost at least S$40,000 to these scammers between July and October this year. There were at least 30 reports of lucky draw scams.</p>

      <p>Scammers would make unsolicited calls - sometimes through mobile apps such as Viber - and tell their victims they had won a prize in a lucky draw campaign with a CAG-related name, such as Changi Millionaire.</p>
      <p>On top of asking for their card or bank account details, they were also told to provide the one-time password (OTP) sent to their mobile phones, said the Singapore Police Force (SPF).</p>
      <p>The victims realised they were cheated after finding that unauthorised transactions had been made on their accounts, SPF added.</p>

      <p>Some victims were also asked to purchase iTunes cards and send the accompanying codes to the scammers over the phone.</p>
      <p>And in recent cases, scammers made unauthorised top-ups to the victims’ Singtel Dash accounts using their credit card information, before making fraudulent transactions through the said Singtel Dash accounts.</p>
