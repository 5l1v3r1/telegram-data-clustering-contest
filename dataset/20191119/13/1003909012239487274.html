      <h1>Emily Triggs offers resilience and hope on sophomore album, Middletown</h1>

      <p>When a friend first heard the songs on Emily Triggs’ new album, Middletown, she immediately reached out to the singer-songwriter.</p>
      <p>“She sent me an email asking me if I was OK,” says Triggs with a laugh. “Because a lot of the songs are about loss. She knows me very well. So I guess she was just concerned.”</p>
      <p>An initial spin of the Calgary-based artist’s 10-song sophomore record does suggest there is more than a little darkness lurking beneath the explorations of love, loss and heartbreak. On the mid-tempo country-blues lament Baby Don’t, the weary narrator sings “my hands keep on burning from trying to relight this flame” to an aloof partner. Triggs evokes ghostly menace on the haunting, slow-burn folk ballad Run From Me, singing “with everyone listening and all the eyes stare, you wrap up your poison and take it again.” But there is light at the end of the tunnel, or at least a vow to persevere. “If it breaks my heart, I pick up the broken parts,” she sings on the achingly beautiful If It Breaks My Heart.</p>

      <p>“I’m not generally thinking about what I want the theme to be of an album while we’re doing it,” says Triggs, who will hold a CD launch Nov. 22 at Festival Hall. “But you come out of the studio and look what you’ve created, because you’re always trying to make sure it flows and that it has some consistency and the songs fit with each other. When it’s done, that’s when you sit back and say ‘What is the theme here?’ And you can always find a string that goes through it somehow.”</p>

      <p>“I think a lot of the songs are about resilience,” she adds. “I think the big word is hope. I can see that theme throughout the songs. But it’s still a new little baby. It’s hard to know what it is yet. Sometimes it takes a couple months.”</p>
      <p>Middletown is the followup to Triggs’ 2014 debut, When Guinevere Went Under, an album she released after years of open-mic jams and playing with Calgary bands such as Magnolia Buckskin and The House Doctors.</p>
      <p>As with her solo debut, Triggs again worked with musician and producer Lorrie Matheson, who is also the other half of her Calgary side-project, The Rosellas. Triggs and Matheson put together a formidable backing band for Middletown, including bassist Chris Byrne and drummer Chris Dadge. They also enlisted Vancouver-based, Calgary-born guitarist Paul Rigby, a frequent collaborator of Neko Case who brought a wide spectrum of tones and colours to the album. Always a prolific writer, Triggs says she consulted with Matheson when it came to whittling down the tracklist.</p>
      <p>“I love working with him because he has got more of an edge and I’m a softer folksinger so it’s a push and pull in the studio to get something different,” Triggs says. “I’ll show up with a bunch of stuff and we’ll sift through it and pull out maybe 16 that we’ll select down from there.”</p>
      <p>Raised in Hemmingford, Que., Triggs began performing when she was a child. Her parents were both part of the folk scene of the 1960s. Her mother Louise Demers Triggs danced in the folk troupe Les Feux-Follets, while father Stanley Triggs’ traditional folk songs are featured on Smithsonian Folkways, the record label for the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
      <p>But thanks to her siblings, her early musical education was fairly broad.</p>
      <p>“My older siblings were six to 10 years older,” she says. “So I’d be listening to my dad’s records, all this folk stuff and my mom’s Elvis records. We didn’t have a television, so I’d just sit there for hours. My siblings had all sorts of things like Iron Maiden and Quiet Riot and Kiss and the Rolling Stones. So I would sit there at a really, really young age and listen to all of it.”</p>
      <p>It may have been a bit of a musical rebellious streak that had her initially avoiding the “full-on traditionalist” leanings of her folk-playing father. But she eventually studied music at Dawson College in Montreal before attending college in Elkins, West Virginia, a school that housed a significant folk library and allowed Triggs to explore Appalachian folk music. She came to Calgary in 2000, initially to visit her brother but quickly became immersed in the city’s music scene.</p>
      <p>While hardly a traditional folk performer, Triggs does have a knack for timeless melodies and crafting seemingly simple lines that nevertheless possess a good deal of gravity: “Even though the world is yours, all you see is rain,” she sings on Trouble.</p>
      <p>“There’s a simplicity to folk writing and that always creeps into my writing for sure,” she says. “In regards to the directness of the language, some of the songs we picked were definitely that type of writing. I can write poetically, but it seems like the songs that are making the albums are the ones with more direct lyrical content.”</p>
