      <h1>Electoral Law Breach Allegations</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:47:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party" target="_blank">New Zealand First Party</a></address>
      <p>Rt Winston Peters</p>
      <p>Leader of New Zealand First</p>
      <p>19 November 2019</p>
      <p>Allegations raised this morning by Stuff Limited / Fairfax concern a party matter but I am confident that New Zealand First has operated within electoral laws, now and for the last 27 years. Declarable donations were declared to the Electoral Commission.</p>
      <p>Our system of democracy is based on the secrecy of the ballot and privacy of party memberships and donations within specified limits.</p>
      <p>We look forward to discussing this matter with the Electoral Commission.</p>
