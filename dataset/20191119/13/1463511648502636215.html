      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:39:32+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:39</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>The Senate on Tuesday received six aviation sector bills from President Muhammadu Buhari for consideration and passage into law.</p>
      <p>The request was contained in a letter addressed to the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, and read on the floor during plenary.</p>
      <p>The letter reads: “Pursuant to Section 58 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), I formally request that the following Six (6) Bills be considered for passage into law by the Senate.</p>
      <p>“The bills are: Civil Aviation Bill, 2019; Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria Bill, 2019; Nigerian College of Airspace Management Agency (Establishment) Bill, 2019; Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (Establishment) Bill, 2019; Nigerian Meteorological Agency (Establishment) Bill, 2019; and Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau (Establishment) Bill, 2019.”</p>
      <p>The Senate President, after reading the letter, directed the clerk to ensure that the bills are gazetted and distributed to Senators.</p>
      <p>The Senate also on Tuesday swore-in Abdullahi Danbaba as Senator representing Sokoto South Senatorial District.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker was sworn-in at 10:55am immediately after the adoption of the votes and proceedings of November 14, 2019 by the upper chamber.</p>
      <p>The oath was administered by the Clerk of Senate, Nelson Ayewoh.</p>
      <p>The Senate President, after the lawmaker was sworn in, directed the Chief Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu, to “give him a befitting seat”.</p>
      <p>The Court of Appeal, Sokoto Division on October 30, 2019 returned Senator Ibrahim Danbaba of the Peoples Democratic Party as Senator representing Sokoto South in the National Assembly.</p>
      <p>Justice Fredrick Oho set aside the judgment delivered by Sokoto State Election Petitions Tribunal which dismissed the appellant’s petition in favour of the respondent, Abubakar Shehu-Tambuwal of the All Progressives Congress.</p>
