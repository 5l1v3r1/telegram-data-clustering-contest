      <h1>The Nintendo Switch Black Friday eShop sale starts later this week</h1>
      <h2>Up to 70% off over 100 games from Friday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:43:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:43</time> by <a rel="author">James Pickard</a></address>
      <p>Now that everyone else has had their turn, the house of Mario has announced that the Nintendo Switch Black Friday eShop sale will start later this week with over 150 games reduced on the EU store.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Nintendo-eShop/Nintendo-eShop-Nintendo-Switch-Nintendo-3DS-and-Wii-U-109605.html">Cyber Deals sale</a> will begin on 22nd November and run until 1st December. In that time, you'll find a whole host of top Switch games for up to 70 per cent off.</p>

      <p>What games are in it, then, I hear you ask? Unfortunately, the full list will not be made available until the sale starts, but Nintendo has announced a few highlights. They are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - 30 per cent off</li>
        <li>Super Mario Odyssey - 30 per cent off</li>
        <li>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe - 30 per cent off</li>
        <li>Cadence of Hyrule: Crypt of the NecroDancer - 30 per cent off</li>
        <li>Dragon Quest Builders 2 - 30 per cent off</li>
        <li>Xenoblade Chronicles 2 - 30 per cent off</li>
        <li>FIFA 20 - 30 per cent off</li>
        <li>Dark Souls Remastered - 40 per cent off</li>
        <li>Dragon Ball FighterZ - 70 per cent off</li>
        <li>Wolfenstein: Youngblood Deluxe Edition - 50 per cent off</li>
        <li>Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate - 50 per cent off</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As you've probably learned to expect from a Nintendo Switch eShop sale, discounts on first-party games are still relatively tame. With the likes of Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey sitting at £60 at full price, that 30 per cent off only brings them down to a little over £40. Deals on physical copies could easily beat that this Black Friday.</p>

      <p>That doesn't mean there won't be any bargains to be had, though. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-06-28-cadence-of-hyrule-crypt-of-the-necrodancer-review-zelda-fans-rejoice-because-this-is-the-real-thing">Cadence of Hyrule</a> for 30 per cent off brings the rhythmic RPG down to under £16 - and that's music to our ears. The impossibly charming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-07-11-dragon-quest-builders-2-review-a-little-breath-of-the-wild-magic-helps-this-sequel-sing">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a> will be £34.99 after the discount, while the impossibly difficult Dark Souls Remastered will tumble to £20.</p>
      <p>With loads more games promised, too, there's bound to be a few more good deals on some indie gems and other ports. Be sure to check back on Friday when the full Nintendo Switch Black Friday eShop sale goes live.</p>
