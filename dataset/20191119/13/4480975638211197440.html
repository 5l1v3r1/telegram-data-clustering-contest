      <p>The NZD/USD pair showed some resilience below 200-hour EMA and managed to regain some positive traction on Tuesday. The momentum lifted the pair to two-week tops around the 0.6425 region, or levels beyond last week's post-RBNZ swing high.<br/> <br/>A sustained strength above a three-day-old descending trend-line <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a>, around the 0.6405-10 region, was seen as a key trigger for bullish traders and behind the latest leg of an upsurge witnessed since the mid-European session amid improving risk <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a>.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, technical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> on 4-hourly/daily charts have been gaining some bullish traction and support prospects for an extension of the ongoing positive momentum. However, slightly overbought conditions on the 1-hourly <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a> warrant some caution.<br/> <br/>Hence, any subsequent move up seems more likely to confront a stiff resistance near the 0.6445-50 heavy supply zone, which if cleared decisively might negate any near-term bearish bias and set the stage for a further near-term appreciating move for the pair.<br/> <br/>Above the mentioned barrier, the pair seems all set to aim towards reclaiming the key 0.6500 psychological mark before eventually aiming to test the very important 200-day SMA resistance near the 0.6520-25 region.<br/> <br/>On the flip side, the 0.6400 handle now seems to protect the immediate downside and is closely followed by support near the 0.6380-75 horizontal zone. Failure to defend the said support levels is likely to accelerate the slide towards testing a strong support near the 0.6330-25 region.</p>
