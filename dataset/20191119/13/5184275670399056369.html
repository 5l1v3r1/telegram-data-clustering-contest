      <p>He said, “Yes, I realised it on the first day itself – when we got done with the marriage rituals and stepped out for some pictures,” says the actor. “I remember looking at us together, and at that moment itself, I knew that she has her own individuality. Later too, when we came to Mumbai and hosted a small get-together for friends and some people from the (film) fraternity, she was extremely comfortable.”</p>
      <p>He further tells that he loves Mira because she doesn’t feel the need to change herself according to the industry. He has been quoted as saying, “Mira doesn’t feel the need to change and adjust. She is who she is, and people like her for that. She has never tried to be someone else and that’s a great thing about her. I always knew that she is going to find her own space and will become her own person.”</p>
      <p>Isn’t that lovely?</p>
