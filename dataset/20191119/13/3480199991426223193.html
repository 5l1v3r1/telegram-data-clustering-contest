      <p>Labour’s Stella Creasy has accused the DUP of dehumanising her and making her a target for abuse.</p>
      <p>Ms Creasy criticised leader Arlene Foster after a DUP policy document published on Tuesday called her “Creasy”, without a prefix, in reference to her role in decriminalising abortion in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>The Labour candidate, who accused Ms Foster of trying to scare women in the region, was at the forefront of legislative moves at Westminster that led to the landmark law change.</p>
      <p>When the 19th-century laws were repealed last month, the Government assumed responsibility for introducing abortion services in Northern Ireland by the end of March 2020.</p>

      <p>The DUP has vowed to explore all legal options in a bid to prevent abortion becoming widely available in the region.</p>
      <p>The party referenced the incumbent Labour MP as it reiterated its anti-abortion stance in its 12 point policy plan.</p>
      <p>“The dangerous vacuum of law and guidance created by Creasy needs fixed,” it stated.</p>
      <p>In response, Ms Creasy, who is pregnant and has been the target of abuse by anti-abortion campaigners, tweeted: “‘Creasy’? I’m a real person @DUPleader but you seem to want to actively encourage people to abuse me by dehumanising me in this way.</p>
      <p>“FWIW (for what it’s worth) there’s no dangerous ‘vacuum’ of law. Only a political party leader who is trying to scare women in Northern Ireland in a bid for votes.”</p>
