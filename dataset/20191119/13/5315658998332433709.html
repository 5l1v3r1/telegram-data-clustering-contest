        <b>Kiingi Tuuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII has cautioned the government against any moves that would further alienate mana whenua from Ihumaatao.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kiingitanga was surprised to hear speculation that Auckland Council might be involved in discussions to buy Ihumaatao from Fletcher Building, spokesman Rahui Papa says.</p>
      <p>“This has come as a surprise and could potentially put the whenua out of reach of mana whenua who are awaiting its return.</p>
      <p>“Council’s involvement is not the “by Maaori for Maaori” solution we had envisaged.”</p>
      <p>Kiingi Tuuheitia visited lhumaatao on Saturday 3rd August and offered to facilitate discussions between mana whenua that resulted in a consensus that they wanted their land returned.</p>
      <p>At the time, Kiingitanga said it was important that the government prevented any further alienation of the people from their land, while discussions were underway, which remains the case today.</p>
      <p>The King’s flag continues to fly at Ihumaatao with the expectation the government will come back to Kiingitanga with its proposed resolution on the disputed land.</p>
