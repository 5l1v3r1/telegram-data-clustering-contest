      <p>South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem unveiled her new anti-meth campaign on Monday (November 19) with the slogan "Meth. We're on It," which was met with heavy criticism and confusion online. </p>
      <p>Noem released a statement behind the campaign, stating, "South Dakota’s meth crisis is growing at an alarming rate. It impacts every community in our state, and it threatens the success of the next generation. This is our problem, and together, we need to get on it. Let’s get meth out of South Dakota."</p>
      <p>The state’s Department of Social Services paid local marketing company Broadhead Co. nearly $449,000 so far this year for the campaign. Governor Noem addressed the controversy in a statement that read, "South Dakota’s anti-meth campaign launch is sparking conversations around the state and the country. The mission of the campaign is to raise awareness — to get people talking about how they can be part of the solution and not just the problem. It is working." </p>
