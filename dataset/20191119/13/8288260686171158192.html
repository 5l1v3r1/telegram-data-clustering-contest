      <h1>'Brighter' - Manchester United star makes key dressing room claim</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | Manchester United will welcome Dean Smith's side to Old Trafford in December for the first Premier League meeting between the two sides since 2016</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:25:38+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:25</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Scott McTominay has revealed what he thinks is behind Manchester United's recent upturn in form.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side head into this weekend's clash with Sheffield United on the back of a two-match winning run in all competitions - and then welcome <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> to Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Apart from the 1-0 reverse at AFC Bournemouth at the beginning of this month, United have won every match since October 24 - five in total</p>
      <p>That has seen United surge from 12th in the Premier League table after a 1-1 draw with Liverpool in October to seventh and nine points off the League's top four.</p>

      <p>This week Birmingham Live are running a special series of articles looking back at the key moments from the last decade for Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>Each day, there will be three new articles; one in the morning, one at lunchtime and one in the evening.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the best bits so far...</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Now McTominay - who has started every League match for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side this season - has put it down to a more vocal dressing room.</p>
      <p>"In terms of the team, I feel we're much, much brighter," he said.</p>
      <p>"The signs are good, the signs are positive and we've talked about things that we can improve on and how we're going to try to improve by the end of the season, which is the business end of the season as well.</p>
      <p>"It's a normal thing to have meetings and for everybody to discuss, that's a normal thing and the sign of a healthy dressing room.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Boys speaking among it in the changing room, saying what they think we can improve on and what are good ideas as well.</p>
      <p>"There's plenty going on, it's not a place to be quiet and in your shell. It's time for people to really step up and start doing their jobs as well."</p>
      <p>McTominay had to pull out of Scotland's squad for European Championships qualifiers with Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>Red Devils boss Solskjaer <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-injury-news-tuanzebe-17278889">has also had to contend with injuries to first-team players</a> Axel Tuanzebe, Diogo Dalot and Paul Pogba.</p>

      <p>"With the injuries we've had, I do think we've coped relatively well with a small squad and a lot of boys playing a lot of minutes in a short space of time," added McTominay, who had to pull out of the Scotland squad for their recent Euro 2020 qualifiers with an ankle injury.</p>
      <p>"I think people forget that we have had a lot of injuries as well, and you can see with Anthony (Martial) coming back, what a difference he makes.</p>
      <p>"There are very positive signs and things are changing. Everybody is looking forward to the next game and wanting that next game to come as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>"Everybody wants to play and that's the sign of a healthy dressing room."</p>
