        <li>Emma Watson said she took a few things from the set of “Harry Potter.”</li>

      <p>Considering how much time they spend on set, it’s no surprise that actors make a lot of memories while filming movies. And so, it’s not surprising that some stars want to take home a few mementos to symbolize their time spent portraying a certain character.</p>
      <p>Movie studios typically own the props that help make movies magical so it’s not exactly easy for actors to swipe things from set. But sometimes stars find a way to take home some impressive or strange props.</p>
      <p>Here are some actors who took props home from their movie sets.</p>
