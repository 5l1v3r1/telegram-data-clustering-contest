      <blockquote>In this video tutorial, I have shown the Hexagon Grid group node which allows generating hexagon or honey comb grid with Animation Nodes in the Blender. It has very simple settings to control the different properties of each polygon of the grid. With this group node, you can generate many different grid-patterns that can be used for backgrounds, floors, etc. Project files available in the video description.<br/><br/>Happy Noding... :)</blockquote>
