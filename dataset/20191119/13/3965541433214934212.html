      <p>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — The family of a 92-year-old Vancouver, Wash., woman who died after ambulance workers who were transporting her allegedly dropped her onto a sidewalk has filed a $4 million lawsuit.</p>
      <p>The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the lawsuit was filed Monday in Multnomah County Circuit Court against American Medical Response Northwest.</p>
      <p>The suit claims that Ethel Watters broke six ribs and her collarbone on Nov. 2, 2018, when the two AMR employees allowed a gurney carrying Watters to tip over.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit says Watters was being transferred from her home to a facility that could care for her cough that had been getting worse.</p>
      <p>The suit says Watters died 11 days later after spending five days at a hospital and six days in hospice care.</p>
      <p>A representative from AMR declined comment Tuesday, saying the company doesn’t comment on pending litigation.</p>
