      <p><u>POLITICS</u><br/><br/><b>The National Coordinator of Alliance for National Transformation (ANT) Gen. Mugisha Muntu has said he will not be part of the section of Ugandans signing a petition to drag President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni to International Criminal Court ICC.</b><br/><br/>Muntu said this during the training of 350 ANT district leaders in the Kigezi Sub-region. The training that was held at Hilltop hotel in Kabale municipality, involved ANT leaders from Kabale, Rukiga, Rubanda, Kanungu, Rukungiri, and Kisoro district.<br/><br/>The petition spearheaded by the People’s Government led by the Former President of Forum for Democratic Change Party FDC, Dr. Kiiza Besigye, requires at least two million Ugandans to append their signatures.<br/><br/>Some of the incidents cited by the Peoples’ government are the brutality against members of the opposition, the attack on Omusinga Charles Wesley Mumbere’s palace in Kasese town which led to the death of more than 100 people, the invasion of the parliament by the army during the age limit debate and the rampant kidnaps and murders in the country.<br/><br/>Muntu said that dragging Museveni to ICC will not directly lead to a change of government; a common mission by all the opposition party members in Uganda.<br/><br/>Muntu instead said that that the opposition should now focus on building local structures and institutions that transform and hold the country together for a peaceful transition of power. <br/><br/>However, he conceded that individual party members have the freedom to sign the petition on their own behalf.<br/><br/>“There are so many approaches in the struggle to liberate Uganda however; this that requires signing a petition to ICC will not have my signature on it. I, however, do not stop any other Ugandan from signing it because it is their right,” he said.<br/><br/>Speaking at the same platform, Martin Okumu, the National Coordinator in Research and Policy for ANT party asked leaders to embrace good communication skills if they are to achieve much politically.<br/><br/>“The best way to deliver your message and leave an impact as a leader is through communication. You must be able to embrace modern ways of communication and then move with the trends to leave a serious impact,” he said.<br/><br/>Edith Ssempala, the chairperson for ANT women’s league said that Uganda’s current problem is a generation of leaders who do not want to adopt new ways of democratic practices.</p>
