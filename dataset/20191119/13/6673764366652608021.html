      <p><b>OSAKA – </b>Forward Salomon Rondon scored a hat trick before halftime as Venezuela humiliated Japan 4-1 in an international friendly on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Winger Yeferson Soteldo added the fourth for the South Americans before the break, while Hotaru Yamaguchi pulled a late goal back for the hosts at Panasonic Stadium Suita.</p>
      <p>The walkover was Japan’s heaviest defeat on home soil under manager Hajime Moriyasu, who experimented with his lineup following a 2-0 win over Kyrgyzstan in World Cup qualifying on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The starting 11 contained five domestic players and included a back four of J. Leaguers Sei Muroya, Shinnosuke Hatanaka and Sho Sasaki alongside Cercle Brugge central defender Naomichi Ueda.</p>
      <p>The untested defensive lineup had no answer for former West Bromwich Albion and Newcastle United forward Rondon, now with Dalian Yifang in the Chinese Super League.</p>
      <p>With his speedy wingers quickly feeding him the ball, the 30-year-old striker was a constant threat for Rafael Dudamel’s side throughout the first half.</p>
      <p>Japan’s defense was exposed in the eighth minute when Soteldo wrong-footed Muroya on the left, then chipped a cross to Rondon, who beat keeper Eiji Kawashima with a header from the middle of the area.</p>
      <p>Japan had a chance to equalize when Shoya Nakajima played a one-two with Takuma Asano to slip through the Venezuelan defense at the top of the arc, but he sent his shot straight at goalkeeper Wuilker Farinez.</p>
      <p>Rondon netted his second in the 30th minute, tapping in a cross from Darwin Machis from directly in front.</p>
      <p>The striker clinched his hat trick three minutes later, scoring with a toe poke from point blank after midfielder Yangel chested a cross from wingback Roberto Rosales into his path.</p>
      <p>Soteldo made it 4-0 when he beat Kawashima on a counterattack in the 38th minute.</p>
      <p>The hosts were fortunate to escape a 5-0 halftime deficit after Herrera hit the post with a long-range effort in the 40th minute.</p>
      <p>Japan improved in the second half, attacking straight from the kickoff, with Partizan Belgrade winger Asano combining on a breakaway with Nakajima, who had his shot saved by Farinez.</p>
      <p>The Venezuelan ‘keeper denied the Porto playmaker again in the 55th minute after Muroya sent him into space with a through ball.</p>
      <p>Second-half substitute Yamaguchi reduced the deficit in the 69th minute when he beat Farinez with a deflected shot from the edge of the area.</p>
