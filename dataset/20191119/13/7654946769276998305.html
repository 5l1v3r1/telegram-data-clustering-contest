      <h1>Dating app The League to pair up users on video speed dates</h1>

      <p>There’s a new speed-dating service in town, and you’re probably not invited.</p>
      <p>The League — the super snobby dating app that <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/06/23/heres-a-dating-app-for-shallow-people-who-deserve-each-other/">claims to only accept people from top schools</a> with enviable jobs — is rolling out a new online speed-dating feature it hopes will be the downfall of swipe-based dating.</p>
      <p>The service, dubbed League Live, lets members get to know one another through two-minute video chats. The new service doesn’t launch until December 1, but The League’s founder Amanda Bradford told The Post that beta tests have shown users are four times more likely to match with someone via a video chat than a traditional profile — and three times more likely to exchange phone numbers afterward.</p>
      <p>“It’s the closest thing you can design in technology that’s like meeting at a bar or meeting at a friend’s party,” Bradford said. “I do see Tinder and Bumble following suit once they see people are going that way.”</p>
      <p>Of course, live video chats with strangers have led to trouble in the past, as sites Omegle and Chatroulette learned when their live video chat features led to complaints of men showing up just to show off their junk.</p>
      <p>That’s where The League’s boasts of being more like a “country club” than a dating app could come in handy. League Live will only allow “League All-Stars” to access the feature. These are users who have the highest “League scores,” which they build up by being positive members of the community.</p>
      <p>Anyone who is reported for inappropriate behavior could be permanently booted from the platform, Bradford said.</p>
      <p>Here how it works: Every Sunday at 9 p.m. local time, members will be able to queue up for League Live, where the algorithm will pair them with a potential match who they will have two minutes to talk to. Users will have the ability to “like” their date at any time during the conversation, and can also press a button to abort the call.</p>
      <p>“You don’t know who we’re going to pair you with,” Bradford said.</p>
      <p>The League, which was widely mocked for its red-velvet-rope standards when it rolled out in 2014, requires members to connect their LinkedIn profiles to show they’ve got what it takes to hang with the exclusive company.</p>
      <p>A small team of employees manually approve or deny each application, and they look for grads from “highly selective” schools, as well as CEOs and company founders.</p>
      <p>But it’s claims of exclusivity also appears also have helped when it comes to attracting members. The League’s New York waitlist currently sits at 70,000 aspiring members, while 40,000 Los Angelinos are angling to join on the West Coast.</p>
      <p>The Post has previously reported on the lengths individuals have gone to be accepted into the League, including one man offering his penthouse roof deck to host League parties. His membership was expedited.</p>
