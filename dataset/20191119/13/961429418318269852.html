          <b>HSJ </b>
        </i>
        <b>has found.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Of the 200 trusts which contributed to <i>HSJ</i>’s research, 133 said they had a chief clinical information officer or equivalent role in post.</p>
      <p>Chief clinical information officers are typically clinicians with experience or knowledge of technology, whose duties include understanding how digital projects will affect clinical services.</p>
      <p>While health and social care secretary Matt Hancock <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/technology-and-innovation/matt-hancock-tells-chief-execs-get-a-cio-on-your-board/7023804.article">has set a clear target for chief information officers to be on trusts’ boards</a>, there is not yet any central mandate for trusts to employ CCIOs.</p>
      <p>Beverley Bryant, NHS Digital’s former director of digital transformation <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/guys-and-st-thomas-nhs-foundation-trust/former-national-it-director-returns-to-nhs-role/7025844.article">who is now chief digital information officer at two London trusts</a>, described the CCIO role as “vital” and the “bridge between the clinical community and IT professionals”.</p>
      <p>“Where a good CCIO can add a lot of value is to persuade their clinical community to change the way they’re working both for their benefit and patients,” she said.</p>
      <p>However, she cautioned against tokenism and said trusts must make sure their CCIO has enough time to do the job properly, rather than have it “thrown against their title without them understanding what it means”.</p>
      <p>“In many organisations most of the digital transformation is being done by clinical teams which don’t have that badge attached to them — they’re just doing it anyway,” Ms Bryant said.</p>
      <p>“The more we can mainstream some of those skills in their day jobs, the more they become part of it.”</p>
      <p>James Freed, Health Education England’s chief information officer, said the CCIO role has “only really taken off in the UK in the last five years”.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t have any CCIOs in England five years ago and now there are trusts with up to eight in their organisation,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I sense there are organisations out there who don’t have a CCIO in place yet because it is such a new profession.</p>
      <p>“One reason we have CCIOs is that they are tremendous advocates for change. If you’re a doctor or a nurse, then you will have much more credibility with your colleagues when you’re trying to explain and engage around new ways of working which involves technology.”</p>
      <p>Several trusts also reported having appointed offshoots of the CCIO role, such as chief nursing information officer and chief pharmaceutical information officer.</p>
      <p>Ms Bryant added the NHS needs to “build the profile” of these other roles.</p>
      <p>She said: “For example, nurses are pivotal to this transformation agenda. Having chief clinical information officers and chief nursing information officers as a professional cohort of individuals is an important step in that transition.”</p>

      <h4><anchor name="Workforce_planning_for_NHS_IT_staff_underway"/>Workforce planning for NHS IT staff underway</h4>
      <p>Health Education England has begun “looking into” workforce planning for NHS informaticians, which will lead to a bigger piece of work exploring how many staff will be needed in the future and where they might come from.</p>
      <p>Mr Freed told <i>HSJ</i> his organisation believes there are currently between 30,000-60,000 informatics staff working in health and social care.</p>
      <p>He said HEE has begun looking at “capacity and supply” within the workforce, and it will look at ways in which the profession can bolster its numbers in the future — for example, by using apprenticeships, partnering with industry and teaming up with schools.</p>
      <p>Currently, around 100 chief information officers and chief clinical information officers are trained every year at the NHS Digital Academy, while lower level staff come from a variety of educational backgrounds.</p>
      <p>Mr Freed said the Digital Academy was training the right number of people, because the NHS is “not ready” for many more senior IT leads given the current state of technology in the health service.</p>
      <p>To help lower level IT staff in the NHS, HEE has been investing through “professionalism routes”, such as the Faculty for Clinical Informatics, which develops standards for clinical health informaticians and has around 500 members.</p>
      <p>“As a profession, informatics is one of the less credentialed and accredited professions in health, and it’s perfectly conceivable to be an informatician with no formal training — just experience,” Freed said.</p>
      <p>“The idea is to make the professional landscape easier to navigate as an informatician, and start conversations about more formal accreditation, training routes and career pathways for informaticians from joining the NHS all the way up to CIO level.”</p>
      <p>The Interim NHS People Plan, <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/workforce/exclusive-dido-harding-boards-should-take-culture-as-seriously-as-finance/7025202.article">published this autumn</a>, called for a “high quality supply” of digital leaders (including CIOs and CCIOs) and for non-technological staff to have ”core-level digital abilities”. </p>
