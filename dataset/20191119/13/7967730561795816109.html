      <h1>Cash-strapped disability support groups warn of service cuts</h1>

      <p>Cash-strapped support providers fear being forced to stop offering critical services such as transportation to thousands of Australians with disabilities, the nation's peak disability services body has warned.</p>
      <p>An independent report commissioned by National Disability Services (NDS), which surveyed 667 Australian disability support providers, found more than half would have to reduce the quality of services under the current pricing model for the National Disability Insurance Scheme.</p>

      <p>NDS acting chief executive David Moody said among the services at greatest risk of being cut were home modifications for people with disabilities and transportation assistance.</p>
      <p>"This means people with disabilities simply may not be able to get to and from the services they desperately need," he said.</p>
      <p>The State of the Disability Sector report, released on Wednesday, also found almost one-third of Australian disability service providers reported a loss of income in last financial year, while only about 10 per cent broke even.</p>
      <p>The NDS, which represents about 1000 non-government providers, is calling for a national mental health strategy to be rolled out to stop those with disabilities and mental illnesses from falling through the cracks.</p>
      <p>The group is also lobbying for viable employment models for people with disabilities, less bureaucratic red tape, more flexibility and a fit-for-purpose pricing model.</p>
      <p>The survey found only 6 per cent of organisations that provide supported employment services for people with disabilities believed the NDIS model was working, while fewer than one-quarter of respondents felt the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) had a "high level of respect for service providers".</p>
      <p>"We’re calling for an urgent conversation with the federal government to review NDIS prices and processes to ensure people with disabilities get the support they need when and where they need them," Mr Moody said.</p>
      <p>"The backlog in processing plans is a serious problem. It is leaving many providers around Australia significantly out of pocket because they’ve chosen to continue providing services, without payment, to support people with disability."</p>

      <p>On Monday the federal government unveiled changes to the NDIS in a push to improve flexibility and address concerns plaguing the program.</p>
      <p>NDIS Minister Stuart Robert announced the "practical changes" after conceding last week some participants were disappointed with the scheme, but he maintained it was on track to cover 500,000 people within five years.</p>
      <p>One key change will allow for longer plans for participants, enabling them to be covered for up to three years without a review. Plans outline a person's needs and goals, to be supported under NDIS funding.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year the NDIA said it took its responsibility for price-setting seriously and had established a Pricing Reference Group to help service providers with funding to support their clients.</p>
      <p>The NDIA has been contacted for comment.</p>
