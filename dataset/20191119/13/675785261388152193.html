      <p>From Brighton to Whitby, the UK is famous for its stunning coastal towns and cities.</p>
      <p>But a terrifying new <a href="https://www.confused.com/home-insurance/living-on-the-edge">interactive map</a> has revealed which of these sites are at risk of being wiped out in the next 20, 50 and 100 years.</p>
      <p>The map was developed by confused.com using data from the Environmental Agency, which predicts the shocking speed of erosion on England’s coastline.</p>
      <p>It suggests that a whopping 7,000 homes will fall into the sea within this century, and highlights four key areas at risk.</p>
      <p>Tom Vaughan, Head of Home at Confused.com said: “Coastal erosion has become one of the  most worrying issues for UK homeowners in seaside towns. Our research highlights the increasing risk that many coastal residents are facing, to the point where some are ultimately looking at losing their homes over the next 20 years.</p>
      <p>“Homes on the coastline have always been popular, especially in the likes of Yorkshire and East England where views are second to none.”</p>
      <p>Here’s an overview of the four key areas identified as being at risk, scroll down for a full list.</p>
      <h3>1. Happisburgh, Norfolk</h3>
      <p>The map predicts that 97 metres - the equivalent of two football pitches - of the Happisburgh area could be lost over the next 20 years.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>And in just 50 years, the map predicts that 150 metres of this area will have disappeared due to coastal erosion.</p>
      <h3>2. Kessingland, Suffolk</h3>
      <p>Kessingland in Suffolk is home to over 18,000 homes, but is predicted to lose 70 metres of its coast in the next 20 years.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in 2069, a huge 175 metres of land is predicted to have been washed away, including land home to farms, holiday parks and houses.</p>

      <h3>3. Hornsea, East Riding of Yorkshire</h3>
      <p>Hornsea is the third most-likely area to be affected by coastal erosion in the next 20 years.</p>
      <p>Coastal erosion is already swallowing up around four metres of land even year, but the map predicts a loss of 68 metres of land by 2039, and 171 metres of land by 2069</p>
      <h3>4. Sunderland, Tyne and Wear</h3>
      <p>Finally, the map predicts that Sunderland will be hugely affected by coastal erosion.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It suggests that 40 metres of the coast will be lost in the next 20 years, and 100 metres by 2069.</p>
      <p>Confused.com said: “Looking at a satellite view, this town may not feel the effects of the creeping coastline in the near future. However, in 100 years’ time, it could interfere with the nearby road and rail links, causing transport issues for residents and commuters passing through.”</p>
