      </p>
      <p>Andrew Dallas will take charge of the match at Celtic Park - his 12th match involving the Hoops, and first this season.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old referee has shown nine yellow cards and one red and awarded three penalties in matches involving Celtic in his career so far.</p>
      <p>In his 12 Scottish Premiership matches so far this term he has shown 12 yellow cards, one red and awarded four penalties.</p>

      <p>Dallas is assisted by Frank Connor and Andy Milne with Don Robertson on fourth-official duties.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MacLean in charge at Accies</b>
      </p>
      <p>Steven McLean is the man in the middle for Rangers' trip to Hamilton - his seventh Scottish Premiership match of the 2019/20 campaign, and his first involving Rangers.</p>
      <p>In his six matches so far this term, McLean has flashed 18 yellow cards and awarded two penalties - including one for Hamilton in their 2-1 win over Livingston on September 28.</p>
