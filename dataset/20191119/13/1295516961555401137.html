      <p>Of those that participated, only 34% stated that a “Theatre Experience” for a blockbuster premiere led to a “Slightly more enjoyable” viewing. Interestingly, 3 out of 4 people said they would be open to paying a premium streaming cost if it allowed them access to new releases at home. 80% of those who expressed interest in this option were Millennials; 76% were Generation X, and 74% were Baby Boomers.</p>
      <p>Almost 70% of people admitted they would prefer to enjoy new movies at home as it is (unsurprisingly) more comfortable. 48% claimed it was due to overpriced theater food and beverages, with 26% sharing that they’d rather watch at home because other moviegoers are too distracting.</p>

      <p>When asked if streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime or Disney+ might further affect their cinematic viewing habits, 64% told Flixed that they will be going to the movies less, thanks to the ease and availability of content on their TVs and streaming devices. Whether this leads to increased interest from production and distribution companies to release their latest blockbuster offerings at a premium streaming price remains to be seen, but the numbers indicate a clear interest in the option.</p>
