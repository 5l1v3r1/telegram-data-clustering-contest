      <h1>College Football Playoff rankings: The case for and against each top 1-loss contender</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Adam Rittenberg</a></address>
      <p>Less than three weeks remain until the College Football Playoff field is set, but few would quibble with the top three teams right now.</p>
      <p>Top-ranked LSU and No. 2 Ohio State have separated themselves all season, and No. 3 Clemson has looked more like a defending champion after a September scare at North Carolina. If all three win out, they'll occupy three of the spots in the final ranking. That brings us to what's shaping up to be the biggest question in the sport: Who's No. 4?</p>
      <p>After Week 12, here are the six teams with the best chance to be No. 4 come Dec. 8.</p>
      <p>You already know the résumés, but judging strictly by what has happened on the field, here's a case for and against each team, with some intel from coaches, heading into the stretch run.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/61/georgia-bulldogs">Georgia</a> (9-1)</h3>
      <p><b>CFP ranking:</b> No. 4</p>
      <p><b>Remaining schedule:</b> Saturday vs. Texas A&amp;M, Nov. 30 at Georgia Tech</p>
      <p><b>The case for Georgia:</b> In a year in which offenses are stealing the spotlight in the SEC, Georgia is driven by defense. The Bulldogs entered Saturday's game at Auburn as the last FBS team yet to allow a rushing touchdown (Auburn broke the streak, rushing for one score). Georgia has allowed only 12 total touchdowns through the first 10 games.</p>
