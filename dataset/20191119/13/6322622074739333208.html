      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 19): No “extraordinary” issues were discussed during a meeting among several members of parliament (MPs) including from the opposition last night.</p>
      <p>In affirming the meeting, Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali said it was a usual meeting, conducted in his capacity as a minister.</p>
      <p>“Nothing unusual. I have a lot of meetings every day from early morning until the late hours. But (with) different people, different groups, there were politicians, MPs, business leaders, foreign investors.</p>
      <p>"That is the job of a minister. I have to meet people,” he told reporters when met outside his office at the Parliament building here today.</p>
      <p>Mohamed Azmin also said he was not the one who organised the meeting.</p>
      <p>Asked whether he would attend PKR's political bureau meeting tomorrow, Mohamed Azmin who is also PKR Deputy President, said he would, provided he did not have any official duties to attend to.</p>
      <p>Earlier today, PKR President Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim was reported as saying that he wanted Mohamed Azmin to attend the meeting to clarify a get-together with UMNO MPs at the latter's official residence in Putrajaya last night. <i>— Bernama</i></p>
