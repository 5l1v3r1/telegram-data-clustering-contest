      <h1>Scottish Secretary Alister Jack backs IndyRef2 'mandate' if SNP wins 2021 Holyrood majority</h1>

        <b>Nicola Sturgeon would have a mandate to stage a second referendum on Scottish independence if the SNP wins a majority in the 2021 Holyrood elections, the Scottish Secretary has indicated.</b>
      </p>
      <p>But Alister Jack warned that a majority in alliance other pro-independence parties like the Greens - which currently exists at Holyrood - would not be enough to legitimise another vote on leaving the UK.</p>

      <p>The claim appears to contradict Prime Minister Boris Johnson who insisted a fortnight ago on a trip to Scotland that he would not grant a section 30 order - allowing a second vote on independence - even if the SNP wins a majority in the the 2021 Scottish elections.</p>
      <p>Ms Sturgeon has claimed that if the SNP wins the majority of Scotland's 59 seats on December 12 in the general election, it would give the party a mandate for a second referendum on independence.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But Mr Jack said this would not be the case. "The democratic mandate for a section 30 order is a matter for 2021," he told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland today.</p>

      <p>"We'll see whether the Scottish National Party get a majority then - and I mean the Scottish national Party. Not in collaboration with other parties, not in any alliances, but a Scottish National Party majority which is what Ruth Davidson pointed out some months ago."</p>
      <p>Mr Jack, who replaced David Mundell as Scottish Secretary when Mr Johnson became Prime Minister, made it clear that the Tories are opposed to another vote on Scotland leaving the UK.</p>
      <p>"He's (Mr Johnson) made it very clear that the decision - the once in a generation decision - was taken in 2014. He has made it very clear that we do not support a second independence referendum.</p>
      <p>"We believe that decision was taken. We should take away the uncertainty as we believe we should with Brexit, remove the uncertainty of independence and start growing the Scottish economy."</p>
      <p>Power over the constitution in the UK lies with the UK Government. A second referendum would require a transfer of power, through a section 30 order, for it to take place.</p>
      <p>The current pro-independence majority at Holyrood - combining the SNP and Greens - has already passed a motion demanding a second referendum.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Ms Sturgeon said today: "There is of course already a mandate, flowing from the 2016 election and the crystal clear manifesto commitment.</p>

      <p>"More generally, I would just say that it shows Boris Johnson's position has been seriously undermined by Alister Jack in a way that shows their position is as flakey on the issue as Labour's.</p>
      <p>"Nobody seriously believes that it is possible to stand in the way of a democratic mandate indefinitely. The position isn't sustainable and that will prove to be the case.</p>
      <p>"So Alister Jack on one level is just stating what everybody knows - there is going to be another independence referendum."</p>
      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has indicated he could allow a second referendum in the later years of a Labour Government, possibly in deal with the SNP which would see nationalist MPs pave the way for him to become Prime Minister in a hung Parliament.</p>
