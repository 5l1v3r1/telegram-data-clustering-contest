      <p>A police pursuit stretched from Penticton to Osoyoos following a car and then suspects on foot Thursday, culminating in an RCMP dog locating the pair. </p>
      <p>On Nov. 14 at 11 a.m., RCMP in Penticton located a woman they knew to be prohibited from driving operating a car with a stolen licence plate. </p>
      <p>Police also recognized the passenger in the car, a man who had been released from jail just one week earlier on conditions which included not being in a motor vehicle. </p>
      <p>The two fled in the vehicle, and RCMP later located them in Oliver and followed them at a distance as they drove toward Osoyoos. </p>
      <p>They took a back road on the east side of Osoyoos Lake as an evasive tactic, but their vehicle became stuck. They then fled south on foot. </p>
      <p>Officers from Penticton, Oliver, Osoyoos, South Okanagan Traffic Services and Police Dog Services convened in the area. After a lengthy search, police dog Haro and his handler Cpl Jason Goodfellow located the two hiding in bushes.</p>
      <p>The BC Prosecution Service has laid one count of breach of probation on the man, Shane Pope of Penticton and one count each of flight from police, dangerous driving and drive while prohibited on the woman, Connie Clarke of Oliver.</p>
      <p>"The great work and coordinated efforts of the South Okanagan regional detachments and Haro were paramount in this incident ending with the arrest and charges and no injuries," said Sgt Jason Bayda.</p>
