      <h3>How does Disney+ work?</h3>
      <p>Disney+ is a new streaming service offering more than 600 films and 7000 episodes of Disney-owned content, according to the press release. It's set to be the only place you'll be able stream on demand any Disney-released movies in Australia. With a single account, up to four devices can use the same login for $8.99 per month. That single plan, unlike other services' tiered offerings, gives you access to HDR and 4K quality streaming.</p>
      <p>Once you log in, you'll be able to see a very Netflix-esque homepage separating the content into its branding categories.</p>

      <p>Selecting shows will bring up their landing page and you'll be able to choose where you'd like to start watching from, read a description or add it to your watchlist. It'll also provide with you suggested content. In the case of <i>The Mandalorian</i>, it suggests I watch the <i>Star Wars</i> back catalogue. <i>Who'd a thunk it?</i></p>

      <h3>What's on Disney+?</h3>
      <p>Most content owned by Disney, but that doesn't just include the classic animated movies. Disney has been busy buying up a lot of entertainment real estate so its streaming lineup also includes most Marvel movies, the <i>Star Wars</i> series, <i>The Simpsons</i>, National Geographic documentaries like <i>Free Solo</i> as well as some Hulu content.</p>
      <p>It also means original Disney content you've never seen before:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Mandalorian</li>
        <li>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</li>
        <li>The World According to Jeff Goldblum</li>
        <li>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</li>
        <li>Loki</li>
        <li>Encore!</li>
        <li>Lady and the Tramp</li>
        <li>Noelle</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It's important to note Disney+'s launch has also meant a lot of content previously on other streaming players, like Stan, has now been pulled off and exclusively housed on the new service.</p>
      <p>Perhaps one of the most surprising features of Australia's Disney+ lineup is <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/disney-plus-has-more-in-australia-than-the-us">how much more content Australians have compared to our U.S. mates</a>. A number of titles are available for Australians on launch while the U.S. version has a staggered release due to existing licencing agreements. What a time to be alive for Aussies.</p>

      <h3>Will Disney+ work on my device?</h3>
      <p>This seems like a no-brainer but it's a valid question. Some users around the world have faced difficulties when using certain devices. It's due to some devices not supporting the highest level of <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/disney-plus-devices-widevine">Disney+'s chosen digital rights management service, WideVine</a>. This service prevents subscribers from recording their screens, for example, to send to their friends.</p>
      <p>Disney has confirmed the following devices will definitely work with the service:</p>

      <h3>What deals are available for Disney+?</h3>
      <p>While some pretty stellar bundle deals exist in the US, no local offerings have been announced. Right now, Disney+ will cost you $8.99 per month but if you purchase a yearly subscription, it's going to cost you $89.99. That means you'll essentially get two months for free or the equivalent of around $7.50 per month.</p>
      <p>If you're not quite ready to take the plunge, Disney's also offering a free seven-day trial so you can dip your feet in without paying a cent.</p>
      <p>Now all there's left to do is <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/">sign up for the service</a>. Just remember to <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/disney-has-a-hacking-problem">use a <i>strong</i> password</a>.</p>
