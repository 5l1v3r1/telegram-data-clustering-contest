      <p>The Cartosat-3 is a "third-generation agile advanced satellite" having high-resolution imaging capability, it said, adding that the satellite would be placed in an orbit of 509 km at an inclination of 97.5 degree. PSLV-C47 is the 21st flight of PSLV in 'XL' configuration (with 6 solid strap-on motors).</p>
      <p>PSLV-C47 would also carry 13 commercial nano satellites from the United States of America as part of a commercial arrangement with NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), Department of Space. ISRO has said, this would be the 74th launch vehicle mission from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota.Â </p>
