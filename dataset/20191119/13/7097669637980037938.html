      <h1>Forget the Bombs or Missiles: Iran's Intelligence Machine Is Quite Powerful</h1>

      <p>Very rarely do any of us on the outside world know with much clarity about what exactly is going on in the world of Iranian intelligence. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iranian military intelligence, and the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security are notorious for their secrecy and efficiency.

While it’s always tricky business to extrapolate from a sample, the reports leaked to the <i>Times</i> and <i>The Intercept</i> point to a nation that is more than willing to push ideology aside in favor of cold-blooded calculation—particularly in next-door Iraq. Three things stand out: </p>
