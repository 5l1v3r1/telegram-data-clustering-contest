      <p>A prominent Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) executive and an alleged accomplice have been arrested in connection with a conspiracy to kidnap and murder senior Popcru officials, the Hawks say.</p>
      <p>The two men were arrested on Tuesday and were expected to appear in the Kempton Park Magistrate's Court, according to Colonel Katlego Mogale.</p>
      <p>The arrests come after the identities of the suspects had been circulated in the media last week.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/popcru-ceo-sought-by-hawks-for-kidnapping-murder-plot-against-unions-top-brass-20191114">News24</a> reported last week that the case is linked to a Hawks investigation, started in September, that found "misappropriation of funds that was carried out though Popcru Investment Group of Companies".</p>

        <b>Ordered to find an assassin</b>
      </p>
      <p>Allegedly the embezzling of these funds had been taking place since 2016.</p>
      <p>Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said that a Lesotho national, Neo Letele, was arrested in Kempton Park on November 6, and was an alleged middleman for the two officials.</p>
      <p>According to Mulaudzi, Letele was ordered to find an assassin who was to be paid R1m to execute a hit.</p>
      <p>"This was in an attempt to silence those who wanted the two suspects to account for the funds."</p>
      <p>Letele appeared in the Kempton Park Magistrate's Court earlier this month. His case was postponed to November 20 for a formal bail application.</p>
