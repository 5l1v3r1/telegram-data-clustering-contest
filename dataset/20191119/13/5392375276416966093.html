      <p>The Huawei Nova 5T begins receiving EMUI 10 based on Android 10<br/>5 (100%) 4 votes</p>
      <p>In September, Huawei and Honor published the dates on which the EMUI 10 beta and, therefore, Android 10 would reach each model. Shortly after, they announced the roadmap they would follow for the deployment of stable versions.</p>
      <p>Complying with it, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Huawei">Huawei</a> has already deployed the update for some phones, such as the P30 and P30 Pro, and yesterday we told you that Honor was doing the same with the models of the Honor 20 series and the Honor View20. However, there is another Huawei terminal that is receiving the update to the stable version of EMUI 10 and that did not appear on that road map. We are talking about the Huawei Nova 5T.</p>
      <h3>EMUI 10: Progressive deployment worldwide</h3>
      <p>After doing the same with the P30 series and the Mate 20 series, Huawei has started pushing the stable EMUI 10.0 update based on Android 10 for the Huawei Nova 5T. And it has done so worldwide, including Europe, East Asia and the Middle East region.</p>
      <p>As we know, the latest version of EMUI brings new features and changes in the user interface. Among which we find the dark mode, a redesigned settings panel, a simplified configuration menu, etc.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.huaweicentral.com/stable-emui-10-for-huawei-nova-5t/">Huawei Central</a>, this update of the Huawei Nova 5T corresponds to version 10.0.0.168 and weighs more than 4.5 GB. So far, most users have received it via OTA through the HiCare application, but if this is not your case, you can try two options: go to Settings&gt; System&gt; Software update&gt; Check for updates or open the HiCare application &gt; Update&gt; Check for updates.</p>
      <p>In addition, Huawei is also sending a stable update with the same version (10.0.0.168) for Beta testers. In any case, as we always say, it is a progressive deployment. So it may take time to reach all users.</p>
