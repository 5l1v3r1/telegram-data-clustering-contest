      <p>PayPal’s former finance chief revealed Bank of America closed his account without explanation, sparking conspiracies that he may have been banned for trading bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.</p>
      <p>Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital and one of Silicon Valley’s most famous investors, shared the news <a href="https://twitter.com/roelofbotha/status/1196234200665346048">in a tweet on Monday</a>.</p>
      <p>“After being a customer of @BankofAmerica for 20 years, I received this notice today that they decided to fire me as their customer! With absolutely no explanation….”</p>
      <p>Botha – who sits on the boards of Square, Bird, Evernote, and other tech companies – attached the notice from Bank of America, which stated his account would be permanently closed in 30 days.</p>
      <p>“After a careful review of your banking relationship, we’ve made the decision to close your account above,” it reads. “This decision is final and won’t be reconsidered.”</p>
      <p>Several members of the crypto community pointed out that PayPal has banned users for trading bitcoin, and suggested Botha may have been banned by his bank for the same reason.</p>
      <p>“That’s funny indeed, he did the same to many people but complains when it happens to him,” crypto investor @JohanDXB <a href="https://twitter.com/JohanDXB/status/1196281496207675392">replied to his tweet</a>.</p>
      <p>Manu Kumar – head of seed fund K9 Ventures, which invested in Lyft and Twilio – <a href="https://twitter.com/ManuKumar/status/1196299972288765952">replied</a> that the “same thing happened to @K9Ventures’ account at @BankofAmerica. No explanation what so ever.”</p>
      <p>Kumar <a href="https://twitter.com/ManuKumar/status/1083461499920642048">tweeted in January</a> that Bank of America closed his company account due to a “determination that this is a business type we have chosen not to serve.”</p>
      <p>Tron and BitTorrent CEO Justin Sun – who famously <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/warren-buffett-justin-sun-timeline-crypto-lunch-china-donald-trump-2019-9-1028522523">paid $4.6 million for a charity lunch with Warren Buffett</a> and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/warren-buffett-lunch-justin-sun-invited-trump-binance-litecoin-execs-2019-9-1028506590">invited Donald Trump</a> to join them, only to postpone at the last minute – said the same thing happened to him.</p>
      <p>“Me too ???? I have been a customer of @BankofAmerica for 8 years and get fired as well ????” he wrote in a tweet that was later deleted.</p>
      <p>David Marcus, PayPal’s former president and co-creator of Facebook’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-libra-facebook-cryptocurrency-calibra-libra-association-congress-zuckerberg-2019-25?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">Libra cryptocurrency</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/davidmarcus/status/1196291930054807552">replied to Botha’s tweet</a> saying, “You’re clearly not their target customer segment…”</p>
      <p>Bank of America <a href="https://twitter.com/BofA_Help/status/1196422163366076416">also replied</a> to Botha’s tweet, saying “accounts are closed for various reasons” and inviting him to call the company for a review of his accounts.</p>
      <p>Bank of America didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.</p>
