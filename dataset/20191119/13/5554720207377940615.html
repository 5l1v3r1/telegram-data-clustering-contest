      <h1>Big relief for Julian Assange as Sweden drops rape investigation</h1>

      <p>In a big relief to Julian Assange, Swedish prosecutors have dropped the rape charge against the Wikileaks founder. A statement by the Swedish Prosecution Authority read, “Deputy Director of Public Prosecution Eva-Marie Persson has today decided to discontinue the investigation regarding Julian Assange. The reason for this decision is that the evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed since the events in question.”</p>

      <p>Assange faced rape allegations the first time in 2010 in Sweden but avoided extradition from the UK after he took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. However, he was arrested by the London police in April this year when the Ecuadorian embassy refused to provide him shelter any longer.</p>
      <p>He was immediately <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/world/wikileaks-co-founder-julian-assange-arrested-after-seven-years-in-ecuadors-embassy-in-london/241413/">arrested</a> by the police in London for violating bail conditions and was later sentenced 52 weeks in jail.</p>
      <p>The latest reprieve for the 28-year-old Australian came after the Swedish authorities interviewed seven witnesses in the rape case.</p>
      <p>Assange had sought refuge at the embassy in 2012 after he got a bail over sexual assault allegations against him in Sweden. He had claimed that he may be arrested by the US and face charges relating to WikiLeaks’s publication of hundreds of thousands of US diplomatic cables if he was extradited to Sweden.</p>
