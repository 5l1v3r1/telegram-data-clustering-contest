      <h1>Govt expects 1,000 tonne onion import by Nov end</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:58:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Private traders have placed orders for importing onions and at least 1,000 tonnes are expected by month-end, which will help ease retail prices that are still ruling high at over Rs 60/kg, a senior government official said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The retail prices of onion had soared to Rs 100/kg a week back in the national capital, but the government's various interventions helped it to cool down a bit, but the rates are still ruling high at over Rs 60/kg in Delhi as well as other consuming areas of the country.</p>
      <p>"Private traders have informed the government that they have imported a small quantity of onion. Traders are expected to order further 1,000 tonnes for delivery by month-end and another lot for next month," a senior Consumer Affairs Ministry official told PTI.</p>
      <p>The shipments will come smoothly as the government has liberalized phytosanitary and fumigation norms for import of onion till December-end, the official added.</p>
      <p>To improve domestic availability and contain price rise, the government is facilitating onion imports through private as well as public trading agencies.</p>
      <p>The government has decided to import 1 lakh tonnes of onion through state-run MMTC, which has already invited bids for import of 4,000 tonnes.</p>
      <p>Onion prices came under pressure due to a 30-40 percent estimated to fall in the Kharif (summer) output this year on account of floods and drought.</p>
      <p>Besides easing norms for import, the government has taken several measures including a ban on exports, stock limits on traders and sale of the commodity stored as a buffer, at a subsidized rate.</p>
