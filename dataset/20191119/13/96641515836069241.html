      <p>There's a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/21/rise-of-skywalker-star-wars-trailer/"><i>Star Wars</i></a> film coming out soon, and <i>Roblox</i> is partnering with Disney to enable players to build their own in-universe vehicles. The Galactic Speedway Creator Challenge tasks you with building your own customized drift speeder and race against your friends. You'll fly across the land, trying to pass through a series of rings as fast as possible, with a number of virtual prizes on offer for the best pilots.</p>

      <p>Do well, and you'll be in with a chance to earn goodies like your own digital BB-8 or D-O, a Star Wars baseball cap, Kylo Ren's re-forged helmet or Rey's staff. The Galactic Speedway Creator Challenge is running between November 19th 2019 and January 6th, 2020. It's not the first time that Roblox has offered pop-culture tie-ins to its education-cum-game-development platform. Previously, users have been able to build games in tribute to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/31/roblox-education-initiative-jurassic-park-kids-coding/"><i>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</i></a> and play around in Dr Seuss' <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/09/roblox-seuss-world/"><i>Seuss World</i></a>.</p>
