      <h1>Eden Hazard hails Real Madrid teammate Karim Benzema as world's best striker</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eden-hazard/"><b>Eden Hazard</b></a> has insisted that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> teammate <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/karim-benzema/"><b>Karim Benzema</b></a> is currently the best striker in world football.</h2>

      <p>The Frenchman has been one of Real's standout performers so far this term, netting 11 goals from 15 appearances in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Moreover, with Benzema now in his 11th season at the Bernabeu, the striker - having made 480 appearances for Los Blancos - is a senior member of the Madrid dressing room under <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/zinedine-zidane/"><b>Zinedine Zidane</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on what it was like to play with Benzema, Hazard told the <i>Daily Mail</i>: "After having played with him for three or fourth months, I think that, right now, he's the best striker in the world.</p>
      <p>"But [also] away from his role as a striker, he makes others better. I feel for him. It's always easier to play against a team that doesn't have Benzema in it."</p>
      <p>French FA president <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/noel-le-graet/"><b>Noel Le Graet</b></a> recently shot down the prospect of Benzema making a return to the France national team for the first time since 2015.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old has been <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/news/benzema-suspended-from-france-squad_261512.html">banned from representing Les Bleus</a> for four years due to his involvement in the blackmail of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mathieu-valbuena/"><b>Mathieu Valbuena</b></a> over a sex tape.</p>
