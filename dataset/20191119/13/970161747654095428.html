      <p>Emilia Clarke was told that she would ‘disappoint’ <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/game-of-thrones/">Game Of Thrones</a> fans if she didn’t do nude scenes.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old starred as Daenerys Targaryen in all eight seasons of Game Of Thrones, and she had some incredibly badass battle and dragon-riding scenes on the show, as well as some scenes which required nudity.</p>
      <p>But Emilia claims that she was told on set that not stripping off for certain scenes would ‘disappoint’ loyal fans.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Dax Shepard on his Armchair Expert podcast, the Last Christmas actress said: ‘I’m a lot more savvy [now] with what I’m comfortable with, and what I am okay with doing.</p>

      <p>‘I’ve had fights on set before where I’m like, “No, the sheet stays up”, and they’re like, “You don’t wanna disappoint your Game of Thrones fans”. And I’m like, “F*** you”.’</p>

      <p>Speaking about the nudity on GoT, Emilia said: ‘I took the job and then they sent me the scripts and I was reading them, and I was, like, “Oh, there’s the catch!” But I’d come fresh from drama school, and I approached [it] as a job – if it’s in the script then it’s clearly needed, this is what this is and I’m gonna make sense of it… Everything’s gonna be cool.</p>
      <p>The Khaleesi star continued: ‘So I came to terms with that beforehand, but then going in and doing it… I’m floating through this first season and I have no idea what I’m doing, I have no idea what any of this is. I’ve never been on a film set like this before, I’d been on a film set twice before then, and I’m now on a film set completely naked with all of these people, and I don’t know what I’m meant to do and I don’t know what’s expected of me, and I don’t know what you want and I don’t know what I want.</p>

      <p>‘Regardless of there being nudity or not, I would have spent that first season thinking I’m not worthy of requiring anything, I’m not worthy of needing anything at all… Whatever I’m feeling is wrong, I’m gonna cry in the bathroom and then I’m gonna come back and we’re gonna do the scene and it’s gonna be completely fine.’</p>

      <p>Emilia added, though, that Jason Momoa, who played Daenerys’s husband Khal Drogo in season one, made her feel comfortable on set.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘It was definitely hard. Which is why the scenes, when I got to do them with Jason, were wonderful, because he was like, “No, sweetie, this isn’t okay”. And I was like, “Ohhhh”.’</p>
      <p>Emilia wrapped her time as Daenerys in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/emilia-clarke-brands-game-thrones-finale-backlash-flattering-addresses-petition-remake-11078078/">much maligned season eight finale of Game Of Thrones</a> back in May.</p>
      <p>She is now on the big screen in festive rom-com Last Christmas, starring opposite Henry Golding and Emma Thompson – but unfortunately, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/last-christmas-fails-live-hype-emilia-clarke-henry-goulding-deliver-festive-turkey-11056563/">the reviews for that aren’t great either.</a></p>
      <p>The Paul Feig directed movie sees Clarke play Kate, who meets the handsome Tom (Golding) while working as an elf at a Christmas shop in London.</p>
