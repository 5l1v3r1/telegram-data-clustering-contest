      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:08:05+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Sports-BureauDUBAI-120864/" target="_blank">Sports BureauDUBAI</a></address>
      <p>The MRF Challenge will kick-start here at the Dubai Autodrome on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Chennai-based 33-year-old Chetan Korada is the lone Indian on the grid that includes teenagers from Europe and Australian veteran Dylan Young, who has been a regular fixture in MRF Challenge.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead to the season, Korada said: “This will be my second international season, also with MRF Challenge. My approach this year would be completely different. Last year was all about learning the car. I didn’t take part in the National championship this year, but did four days of testing in Malaysia in the summer.</p>
      <p>“I have been studying the data as to where I can improve. I am continuing with MRF Challenge as they have been very supportive. So, overall, I am feeling good and hope to put in much better performances this season.”</p>
      <p>The MRF Challenge will comprise 15 races spread over three rounds to be run in Dubai (November 21-23), Bahrain International Circuit, Bahrain (Dec. 12-14) and MMRT, Chennai (Feb. 14-16, 2020).</p>
