      <h1>'Britain's fattest cat' given crash diet after becoming too big to clean herself</h1>
      <h2>The manager of the rescue centre Paisley was handed into says the cat's size 'took her breath away'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:36:08+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:36</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>A tubby tabby dubbed Britain's fattest cat has been put on a strict diet after leaving staff at a rescue centre 'lost for words' when she was handed in.</p>
      <p>Four-year-old Paisley weighs in at a whopping 1st 7lbs (9.5kg), double the weight of a healthy cat, and went into a rescue home when her owner couldn't cope anymore.</p>
      <p>Staff at Cats Protection's National Cat Adoption Centre in West Sussex even have to help her clean herself as she has become to big to manage it herself.</p>
      <p>It's thought porky Paisley's massive bulk comes from being overfed by her previous owner, combined with a lack of exercise and poor diet, which saw her weight skyrocket.</p>

      <p>Deputy manager of the rescue centre, Tania Marsh, said: "When I saw Paisley I thought 'oh my goodness'.</p>
      <p>"It took my breath away. She's the fattest cat I've ever seen.</p>
      <p>"I've been with Cats Protection for 13 years and we get some cats on the larger side sometimes but nothing of this extent.</p>
      <p>"We can only put it down to the quantity of food she was given.</p>
      <p>"Paisley was loved with food if you like. She was a mainly indoor cat and didn't go outside that much so there was a lack of opportunity for exercise.</p>

      <p>"She's lovely, she's very loving and interactive. She's such a dear little cat so it's sad to see her the weight that she is.</p>
      <p>"Paisley likes to sit on your lap but she really struggles to be as active as she should be."</p>
      <p>The good news is after being given up with for adoption on October 17, Paisley has already found a new home where she will be moving to shortly.</p>
      <p>She's started a vet-prescribed diet to help her beat the bulge and has already shifted one pound on her new healthy lifestyle.</p>

      <p>Despite the positive progress, there's still a chance poor Paisley will develop diabetes.</p>
      <p>Tania said: "There are so many health risks that are coming her way because of her weight such as diabetes and heart problems.</p>
      <p>"When she goes to her new home she'll have to maintain the diet, no treats are allowed.</p>
      <p>"The cat food is specially formulated to have less calories and it allows them to feel fuller for longer so they don't feel hungry all the time.</p>
      <p>"Regular checks with the vet will also be needed, we need to make sure she doesn't lose weight too quickly otherwise she could develop a fatty liver."</p>
      <p>She added: "My advice would be to feed your cats twice a day. Limit the treats and tidbits in between and if you do give them to your cat then modify their meal size accordingly.</p>
      <p>"Interact with them and move with them as much as possible.</p>
      <p>"If you can't feel their ribs you need to think about helping them slim down."</p>
