      <p>Update 11/19/2019 12:58pm:</p>
      <p>Antonio Brown has been facing issues with the NFL since being dropped from the New England Patriots, mainly because of allegations that surfaced while he was briefly on the team. Now, Brown has taken to Instagram to apologize to Robert Kraft for all the issues that went down.</p>
      <p>AB said “Mr.Kraft I apologize sincerely to you and your organization! All I wanted to be was an asset to the organization; sorry for the bad media and the drama! Thank you sincerely AB."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/257898/update-new-england-patriots-drop-antonio-brown-amidst-rape-allegations">Antonio Brown was previously released by the New England Patriots</a> this past Friday, and now it was revealed that Patriots allegedly have refused to put out the first part of the AB’s $9 million signing bonus.</p>
      <p>This may come back to bite the Patriots though, because Brown did not commit a “forfeitable breach” under his contract. Reports have noted that Brown’s minimum pay from the Patriots is set to be $283,333.</p>
