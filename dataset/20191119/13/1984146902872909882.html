      <h2>Phil Parkinson has hinted some youngsters will get their chance in the FA Cup replay at Priestfield</h2>

      <p>Sunderland fans want to see a mixture of youth and experience in tonight's FA Cup first-round replay at Gillingham.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Black Cats</a> head to Kent with a lengthy injury list - and four more players away on international duty.</p>
      <p>Manager Phil Parkinson must do without Jordan Willis, Joel Lynch, George Dobson, Lynden Gooch, Charlie Wyke, Marc McNulty and Elliot Embleton at Priestfield tonight, while Jon McLaughlin, Conor McLaughlin, Tom Flanagan and Benji Kimpioka are away with their respective countries.</p>
      <p>Seven players from the Under-23 squad are included tonight, with <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Parkinson</a> hinting that the likes of Brandon Taylor and Jack Bainbridge could be given a start, with Sunderland's depleted numbers at the back a concern.</p>
      <p>However, fans using our team selector tool have gone for a mix between experience and youth in their most popular selection.</p>
      <p>The fans want to see a debut for former Chelsea youngster Ruben Sammut in central midfield alongside Max Power.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has been pushing for a first-team call since his arrival from Stamford Bridge, and he makes the fans XI along with defender Bainbridge and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/bali-mumba">Bali Mumba.</a></p>
      <p>Mumba gets the nod from supporters in the right-back role, a position which the club feel could be his best in future years.</p>

      <p>Up front, it's a return for Will Grigg alongside Chris Maguire, while Aiden McGeady and Duncan Watmore provide the danger from the flanks.</p>
      <p>The winners of tonight's tie will play either Doncaster Rovers of AFC Wimbledon at home in the second round.</p>
