      <h1>Dad Opens Neighbour’s Parcel To Find 14-Inch Sex Toy</h1>

        <b>A story has emerged that perfectly demonstrates how you should always – <i>always</i> – double-check the address on your post before tearing into the packaging. Especially at this time of year when parcels are flying all over the show.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Failing to do so may well end up in awkwardly avoiding your neigbour’s eyes for evermore, no longer able to make riveting small talk about bin collections or parking permits.</p>
      <p>This is the hand life has dealt Cody Wanamaker, a 27-year-old metal fabricator from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who is now doomed to hiding behind lamp posts whenever he spots his neighbour in the street.</p>

      <p>Cody’s living nightmare began when he accidentally opened his neighbour’s parcel, having not been wearing his glasses at the time. And he couldn’t have picked a worse time to do a quick squint.</p>
      <p>Rather than a nice work blouse or an electric whisk, Cody unwrapped an eye-wateringly girthy 14-inch sex toy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A stunned Cody has since revealed:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I just came home from work and the parcel was on the doorstep. I went to take it in my house and the bottom fell through.<br/><br/>When I saw it, I was just stood looking at it like what the hell. It was just so big. It’s so funny. It was just a big 14-inch dildo. I just thought, ‘what are they doing with this big black dildo’, but each to their own.</blockquote>

      <p>One small blessing is Cody isn’t actually acquainted with the neighbour in question, meaning he won’t be blushing his way through excruciating beers and barbecues for years to come.</p>
      <p>
        <b>According to Cody:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I was worried I was going to have to go round to the neighbours and tell them I’d accidentally opened their dildo because I didn’t have my glasses on.</blockquote>
      <p>The saga continued after Cody ended up leaving the, erm, package within a package on the wrong doorstep, meaning someone else had the unenviable job of handing the colossal phallus to its eagerly awaiting owner.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cody said:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I delivered it to the neighbour on the wrong side. I saw them walking back over with it. Most of the street has seen it now but I don’t care. It’s funny. I haven’t seen them since, they could be in hiding.</blockquote>

      <p>After sharing pics of the raunchy delivery on Facebook, Cody’s story has since gone viral; attracting no fewer than 5,000 likes and 10,000 shares while providing inadvertent advertising for Specsavers.</p>
