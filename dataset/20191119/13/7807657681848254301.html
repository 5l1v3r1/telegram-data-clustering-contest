      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Windows Update Assistant can now update your PC to the Windows 10 November 2019 Update.</li>
        <li>The assistant is useful for people whose devices haven't received the update yet.</li>
        <li>The Windows 10 November 2019 Update is similar to a service pack, focusing on improving an existing version of Windows 10.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can now update your PC to the Windows 10 November 2019 Update using the Windows Update Assistant (<a href="https://mspoweruser.com/windows-10-1909november-2019-update-is-now-available-via-windows-10-update-assistant/">via MSPU</a>). The tool allows you to upgrade your PC even if your system hasn't seen the latest update automatically. You can <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.msafflnk.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F433017%2F7593%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU71907YYw%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.microsoft.com%252Fen-us%252Fsoftware-download%252Fwindows10&amp;token=H8vqLYWu">download the Update Assistant</a> directly from Microsoft to get the latest update.</p>
      <p>The Windows 10 November 2019 Update, also known as Windows 10 version 1909, focuses mainly on fixing bugs and building on top of previous versions of Windows 10. Rather than bringing a wide range of new features like some feature updates, Windows 10 version 1909 acts like a service pack.</p>
      <p>While the update doesn't have many new features, it's still worth grabbing now. Our Senior Editor Zac Bowden said in <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10-november-2019-update-review">his review of the update</a> "This is a Windows 10 feature update you should be comfortable with installing because it's incredibly stable, has a few excellent additions that improve the overall user experience, and isn't as much of a risk to install."</p>
