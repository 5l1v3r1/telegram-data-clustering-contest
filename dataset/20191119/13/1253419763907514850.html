      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:18:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:18</time> by <a rel="author">John Papadopoulos</a></address>
      <p>Quantic Dream has announced that Detroit: Become Human will come out on the PC on December 12th. Like its previous titles, Detroit: Become Human will be exclusive to the Epic Games Store. In order to celebrate this announcement, the team has also released a new PC gameplay trailer.</p>
      <p>Detroit: Become Human promises to feature stunning graphics on the PC, with full 4K native support. The game will also come full integration of both mouse/keyboard and gamepad controls.</p>
      <p>Detroit: Become Human will put the destiny of both mankind and androids in your hands. The game will take you to a near and not-so-impossible future where machines have become more intelligent than humans. Every choice you make affects the outcome of the game, with one of the most intricately branching narratives ever created.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Quantic Dream did not reveal whether there will be a PC demo for Detroit: Become Human. Furthermore, the team has not revealed yet the gameâ€™s PC system requirements.</p>
      <p>But anyway, enjoy the following PC trailer (courtesy of IGN) and stay tuned for more!</p>
