      <p>The Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? coughing scandal will be the subject of a new <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/celebs-tv/">ITV mini-series </a>starring Michael Sheen as Chris Tarrant.</p>
      <p>Written by Nottinghamshire playwright James Graham, who also penned critically-acclaimed West End drama Ink, Channel 4's Brexit: The Uncivil War and an episode of Netflix's The Crown, Quiz will be screened next year.</p>
      <p>It tells the extraordinary story of how Charles and Diana Ingram attempted an audacious heist on the popular prime time quiz show.</p>
      <p>Major Ingram, his wife and an accomplice, Tecwen Whittock, who was sitting in the audience, were accused of cheating their way to the million pounds jackpot, back in 2001.</p>
      <p>The couple stood trial for conspiring to cough during the recording, to signify the correct answers to the multiple choice questions.</p>

      <p>The three-parter is directed by Stephen Frears (A Very English Scandal, Florence Foster Jenkins, Philomena, The Queen) and was originally a West End play, penned by <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/mansfield">Mansfield-born Graham.</a></p>
