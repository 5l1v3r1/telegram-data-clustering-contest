      <h1>Top bottles of whisky and gin up for auction with prices starting as low as £1</h1>
      <h2>Fancy stocking up for the festive season?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:57:37+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:57</time> by <a rel="author">John Scheerhout, Jillian MacMath</a></address>
      <p>Around 400 bottles of high-end booze are being auctioned off at discount rates - just in time for the festive season.</p>
      <p>Auction house Simon Charles launched the online auction last week after it received a haul of booze from a hospitality company.</p>
      <p>The lot was intended for Christmas functions, weddings and corporate dos, the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/its-christmas-bargain-high-end-17267298">MEN</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Among the spirits being sold are premium bottles of whisky, vodka and gin which usually retail for between £30 and £50.</p>
      <p>But the opening bid for a number of products is just £1.</p>

      <p>With just four days remaining in the auction, many of the items have attracted few bids or none at all, meaning you may be able to snag the bottles for seriously discounted prices.</p>
      <p>Auctioneer Ed Railton said: "It's a buyers' market. Everything will be coming in at much lower than you would expect to pay at retail, which is great for people tightening their belts at this time of year.</p>
      <p>"For the price of a normal supermarket midrange, you could get something a little bit more special."</p>
      <p>Among the offers are gins and whiskies from small independent distilleries some of which are limited editions and are no longer being produced, Mr Railton said.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday afternoon, the highest bid for a Laphroaig Islay Triple Wood single malt whisky, which retails for more than £50 on the high street, was just £20.</p>

      <p>There are also a number of cases of 24-pack cases of Fever Tree Tonic beginning at just £1.</p>
