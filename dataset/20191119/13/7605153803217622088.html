      <p>Muganda will leave the company at the end of November when Murungi’s appointment will take effect.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Capital Business on Tuesday, Muganda confirmed that he will be leaving the company but was hesitant to give reasons why.</p>
      <p>“I can confirm that I will be leaving the company but at this point I am not comfortable to say my reasons for exiting,” he said.</p>
      <p>Muganda took the role of Managing Director at Vivo Energy Kenya after he quit Nation Media Group in January 2018 where he headed the company as the Group Chief Executive Officer.</p>
      <p>“I would like to thank Joe for the contribution he has made as MD of Vivo Energy Kenya and wish him well for the future. I am certain that Peter will build on this success to steer the organization to even greater achievements,” Hans Paulsen, Executive Vice President East and Southern Africa, said.</p>
      <p>“Peter brings a wealth of experience to the role, having worked for Vivo Energy and Shell since 2007, most recently leading the Vivo Energy Group’s implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning system,” Vivo said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Murungi joined Shell Kenya in 2007, where he worked as a Depot Manager in both Nairobi and Mombasa.</p>
      <p>In 2011 he transferred to Vivo Energy’s operations in Namibia, initially as Supply and Distribution Manager, before becoming Supply and Marketing Manager in 2013.</p>
      <p>Murungi holds an MBA as well as a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Nairobi.</p>
      <p>He is a member of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply in the UK.</p>
