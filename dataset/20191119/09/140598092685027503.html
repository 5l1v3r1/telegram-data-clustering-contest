      <h1>Alberto Bettiol: It is a disgrace and unfair that women earn so little in prize money </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:47:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/john-macleary/" target="_blank">John MacLeary</a></address>
      <p>Alberto Bettiol has described the prize money given to women at the Tour of Flanders, one of the biggest one-day races in the men's and women's WorldTour calendars, as 'a disgrace'.</p>
      <p>Italian rider Bettiol earned €20,000 in prize money <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/2019/04/07/tour-flanders-2019-live-updates/">for winning the Tour of Flanders</a>, one of the five monuments of the sport, while <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/2019/04/07/marta-bastianelli-makes-field-day-italy-tour-flanders/">his compatriot Marta Bastianelli was handed just €1,265 for winning the women's edition</a>.</p>
      <p>Dominated by some of the biggest names in women's cycling, the cobbled classic – won by Britons Nicole Cooke in 2007 and Lizzie Deignan and 2016 – is raced over a similar route to the men's while it equally remains one of the most prestigious on the calendar.</p>
      <p>However, similarly to a number of WorldTour races the prize money handed to women is considerably less to that given to their male counterparts, a fact that has not gone unnoticed by the Bettiol who landed the first win of his career in Belgium in April. </p>
      <p>"We earn a lot via our contracts but prize money is very low," Bettiol told Italian sports newspaper <i>La Gazzetta dello Sport</i>.</p>
      <p>"The winner of the Tour of Flanders gets only €20,000. It’s even worse for the women. Marta Bastianelli won only €1,265. That's a disgrace and unfair because she suffered just like I did or perhaps even more and women’s cycling is now an established reality."</p>
      <p>As it stands, just one women's WorldTour race – the RideLondon Classique –​ hands riders equal prize money to its male equivalent which at €100,000 makes the race the richest one-day event in world cycling.</p>
