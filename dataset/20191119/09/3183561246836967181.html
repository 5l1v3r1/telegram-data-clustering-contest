      <p>Author Holly Black is probably best-known for her <i>Spiderwick Chronicles</i> series, which she created with artist <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/inside-the-fantasy-art-of-superstar-artist-tony-diterli-1707283891">Tony DiTerlizzi</a>. But she’s written dozens of fantasy novels and stories for young readers, including Disney Publishing’s brand-new <i>Heart of the Moors: An Original Maleficent: Mistress of Evil Novel.</i></p>
      <p>According to the publisher, the novel is “set between Disney’s <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/maleficent-isnt-a-good-movie-but-i-love-it-anyway-1583669656"><i>Maleficent</i></a> and <i>Maleficent: Mistress of Evil</i>, in which newly-queened Aurora struggles to be the best leader to both the humans and Fair Folk under her reign; her beau, Prince Phillip, longs to get to know Aurora and her kingdom better; and Maleficent has trouble letting go of the past.”</p>
      <p>In this mini-documentary from director Brendan Choisnet, debuting exclusively on Gizmodo, the charismatic Black takes you along as she sees the finished version of the book for the first time, meets fans at New York Comic Con, and even offers a glimpse of her amazing secret library, which is entered via a hidden door and is therefore 100 per cent dream home architecture in action.</p>
