      <p>After six consecutive league losses, and a painful 2-2 draw against non-league Darlington in the FA Cup, the Saddlers have now won two on the bounce and look a threat going forward.</p>
      <p>As a whole, the team have scored eight goals in those two wins, with Josh Gordon bagging four of them.</p>
      <p>He’s been playing alongside strike partner Caolan Lavery, with the pair looking to form a potent attacking threat under the tutelage of former Premier League striker Stewart.</p>
      <p>“Every day after training we’re always pecking his head, trying to get information,” Gordon said.</p>
      <p>“What I can do better and when you’re not in the team it can give you a bit more time sometimes to get that extra 10/15 minutes on the training pitch.</p>
      <p>“It’s paying off.</p>
      <p>“The information he gives us is quality.</p>
      <p>“I know people have missed chances, but I think you can see where we’re getting into the right areas and we’re always in and around the box trying to get goals.”</p>
      <p>Lavery added: “He stays out with us probably two or three times a week, sometimes more and helps us along the way. He gives us different ideas, different situations and puts us into those situations so when it comes to a Saturday we can replicate.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, winger Wes McDonald has been in electric form and the 22-year-old is also giving Stewart credit for improving his forward game.</p>
      <p>“When you have a guy there that has played at the highest level, I just want to soak up all the information I can get from him,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He’s always working with me, if it’s knocking it into space, inside or outside.</p>
      <p>“Small little tips like that, it’s very helpful.”</p>
