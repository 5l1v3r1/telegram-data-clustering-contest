      <h1>International Men’s Day: 6 celebs who’ve helped redefine masculinity in 2019</h1>

      <p>It’s International Men’s Day, 2019. A day to discuss important male issues – male mental health, damaging male stereotypes, the alarmingly high rate of male suicide – it’s also a day to celebrate the people doing so all year round.</p>
      <p>These public figures are changing the conversation around masculinity, and redefining the phrase ‘man up’…</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Gareth Thomas for his continuous openness and honesty about being a gay sportsman</b>

      <p>Homophobia in sport is, frankly, a depressing subject. No openly gay player has ever appeared in the English Premier League, nor for any team in the Rugby Six Nations. It doesn’t take a genius to realise that, statistically, that doesn’t add up.</p>
      <p>So, when Welsh rugby legend Gareth Thomas, the 13th highest international try scorer of all time, and a former captain of the British and Irish Lions, announced that he was gay in 2009, it was a pretty seismic move.</p>
      <p>In 2018, he was the victim of a homophobic attack in the street, and then came out as HIV positive earlier this year. He’s since campaigned tirelessly to open a dialogue, and break down stigma surrounding the condition.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Timothee Chalamet for wearing feminine fabrics in a masculine way</b>

      <p>2019 has been a breakout year for gender-fluid fashion, and this emerging American superstar is on the crest of the wave.</p>
      <p>The young actor has cheekbones for miles, and complements them with a wide wardrobe of designer outfits from across the sartorial spectrum. Consider the silver, cowl-necked blouse he wore to the premier of The King, the glitter-coated hoodie that stole the London Film Festival, and the patterned suits… be still my beating heart, the patterned suits.</p>
      <p>Honourable mentions must also go to Billy Porter’s red carpet dresses, and Harry Styles rocking the Met Gala with black lace.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Christopher Eccleston for talking about male eating disorders</b>

      <p>The word ‘brave’ gets thrown around a lot, particularly when it comes to celebrity revelation, but the contents of Christopher Eccleston’s autobiography were brave, moving, and borderline heroic.</p>
      <p>The former Doctor Who frontman tackled his long-standing anorexia, his history of anti-depressants, and a severely complex relationship with his father, while candidly articulating the barriers of traditional ‘maleness’.</p>
      <p>It was the first time he’d publicly discussed his struggles. “I always thought of it as a filthy secret, because I’m Northern, because I’m male, because I’m working class.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Sam Smith for being non-binary</b>
      </p>

      <p>It’s commonly claimed that we care too much what celebrities think and say, but Smith’s announcement that they were non-binary, and would henceforth use the pronouns ‘they/them’, proved just how powerful such pronouncements can be.</p>
      <p>The result was an up-swell of hope within the community, coverage in the international media, and recognition of ‘non-binary’ by Collins Dictionary. “I understand there will be many mistakes,” said Smith, “but all I ask is you please, please try. I hope you can see me like I see myself now.”</p>
      <p>Sam Smith isn’t big on conventional definitions of masculinity. In fact, they’re quite happy to discard them altogether.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. John Legend for being utterly awesome</b>
      </p>

      <p>Honestly, it feels like John Legend has had quite enough accolades recently. The victorious coach on The Voice, People’s Sexiest Man Alive 2019, and husband to the unquestionable <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Queen of Twitter</a>, you could be forgiven for getting a little tired of his relentlessly wholesome success.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, he just won’t stop being the very model of a modern man. He was the only major recording artist brave enough to give testimony in the devastating documentary <i>Surviving R Kelly</i>, campaigns relentlessly against poverty and sexual violence, and tweets more about his family than his career.</p>
      <p>Hooray for John Legend. Again.</p>

        <b>6. Professor Green for vocalising male mental health issues in a tough world</b>

      <p>The cut and thrust of the rap world has not traditionally allowed much space for vulnerability, which makes Professor Green’s willingness to discuss his own mental health all the more powerful and impressive.</p>
      <p>A patron of anti-suicide charity CALM, and former presenter of the BBC Three series <i>Suicide And Me</i>, the rapper and songwriter never fails to tackle topics head-on. “There is strength in admitting being vulnerable,” he said at a talk earlier this year, “because as soon as you’re honest about how you feel, you can deal with it.”</p>
      <p>When Pro Green talks, people listen.</p>
