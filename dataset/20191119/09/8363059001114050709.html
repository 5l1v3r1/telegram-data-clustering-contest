      <h1>Captain Pike Fans Are in for a Treat With This Majestic Star Trek Bust</h1>

      <p>If you're a Star Trek: Discovery fan, you can now get a your very own bust of Anson Mount for just $149.99.</p>
      <p>That's around £115 which is actually a steal for a 1:2 scale bust of the <a href="https://chroniclecollectibles.com/collections/featured/products/captain-christopher-pike-bust">Star Trek captain</a> that stole the show on Discovery. And in anticipation of the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/breaking-down-the-old-friends-and-new-secrets-of-star-trek-picards-latest-trailer/">new Picard show</a>, you can also add a <a href="https://chroniclecollectibles.com/collections/featured/products/captain-jean-luc-picard-bust">Captain Picard bust</a> to your new bust collection for the same price.</p>
      <p>Both collectibles sport a hand-painted faux bronze finish and are made from polyresin. Pike measures 9” wide, 7” deep, and 13” tall, and weighs in at 8 pound/3.63kg, while Picard is slightly bigger at 9.5” wide, 7” deep, and 14” tall, and weighs 6 pounds/2.72kg.</p>
      <p>Quantities of both are limited so you might want to get a wriggle on and order them while you can. If you can't scrounge up all of the cash right now, there's a three month payment plan available on the site, so you don't have to miss out. The busts won't ship until Q3 2020 so there's a bit of a wait, but you can use the time to turn the spare bedroom into your bronze bust vault.</p>
