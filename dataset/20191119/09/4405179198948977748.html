      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:17:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/author/karen-haslam/" target="_blank">Karen Haslam</a></address>
      <p>Fancy a new Mac mini? You don't have to pay full price! We've scoured the web for the best deals on a Mac mini so you can save money on a new Mac.</p>
      <p>When you are looking for a good deal on a new Mac, the first thing to do is to check what the price would be if you bought from Apple, rather than assuming that the reseller selling you a Mac is quoting the correct price. Also, remember that once a new model is launched Apple usually sells it for the same price as the previous generation, so, with the price of a new model in mind, a small discount on an old model may not look so attractive, this is why we always quote the price that Apple sells the equivalent model for today.</p>
      <p>It's also worth noting how old a particular model is. It's more than a year since Apple updated the Mac mini, so we could be seeing an update soon, and if new models arrive you might find even better discounts on the older models.</p>
      <p>However, we'd advise you avoid doing so right now as the previous range of Mac mini models dates back to 2014. Apple went for a number of years without updating the Mac mini.</p>

      <h3>Mac mini price</h3>
      <p>Apple sells two Mac mini models right now, with prices starting at £799/$799.</p>
      <p>3.6GHz quad-core 8th-gen i3 processor, 8GB RAM and 128GB SSD, <b>£799/US$799</b> </p>
      <p>3.0GHz 6-core 8th-gen i5 processor, 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD, <b>£1,099/US$1,099</b></p>
      <p>You can order a Mac mini <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini">directly from Apple</a>.</p>
      <p>The Mac mini is a great choice because it's the cheapest Mac you can get and yet it's also one of the more powerful models. The only thing to bear in mind is that you will need to purchase a separate screen, mouse and keyboard, but perhaps you already have those. With some great discounts available, buying a Mac mini is without a doubt the cheapest way to get a Mac. If you'd like some help to choose the best Mac for you, read our <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac/best-mac-3460836/">Mac buying guide</a> where we cover all the models.</p>

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>Save money on the <b>2019 iMac</b> with this deal from Currys PC World. It's better than the firm's advertised discount because this is the top-of-the-range £2,249 model.</p>
      <p>If stock runs low, an identical deal is offered by <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07NK5W4BM/?ascsubtag=41-3775901-19-0000000">Amazon</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>With this deal you can get money off a 27in Retina 5K iMac - but note, this is the 2017 model, with 7th gen quad-core Kaby Lake chips, running at 3.8GHz, with Radeon Pro 580 graphics. Back when it was on sale it was the top-of-the-range model and cost £2,249 (although right now you'd probably be looking at spending £1,849 on a similarly specced model). John Lewis is currently selling it for £1,799.</p>

      </p>
      <p>John Lewis has money off the <b>2019 3.6GHz quad-core iMac</b> (£1,249 at Apple).  This model isn't the cheapest iMac - Apple still sells a 2017 model at the entry-level, but with this price cut this Mac is much better value than the entry-level model.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Amazon is offering money off 2017's entry-level 27in iMac. This model has a 3.4GHz 6-core processor and the Radeon Pro 570 graphics. It's a great saving for this powerful machine.</p>
      <h4>6. Apple 21.5in iMac, 3.4GHz quad-core, 4K Retina Display, 1TB Fusion Drive (2017)</h4>

      </p>
      <p>You can save on the original price of this 2017 21.5in iMac at Amazon. This model has a 4K display and a 1TB Fusion Drive which combines an SSD with a hard drive for the best of both worlds. Note that Apple updated the iMac range in March 2019 and this model has been replaced with a new iMac with better specs so the previous price is a little misleading.</p>
      <p>Still, considering that Apple is selling the current entry-level iMac for £1,049, despite the fact that it's from 2017 too, this deal is pretty good.</p>
      <p>This isn't the best price we've seen for this iMac on Amazon though, at the beginning of November it was £977.97 so it might be worth keeping an eye on it!</p>

      <p>If it's the <b>2019 3.6GHz quad-core iMac</b> (£1,249 at Apple) you want, then check out Laptops Direct. The discount was more previously though - we've recently seen £288 off. Also note that the saving that Laptops Direct is quoting doesn't align with any Apple's price. </p>

      <p>This is a small but decent saving on the price of the <b>2018 quad-core 3.6GHz Mac mini</b>. (FYI, we've seen this particular model discounted more on Amazon, so it might be worth waiting a week or two for bigger discounts - Amazon and Laptops Direct chase each other's prices on this one.)</p>

      </p>
      <p>Get the entry-level iMac for less than £1,000 with this Amazon deal (which is about £20 better than it was at the start of May 2019). But remember, this model lacks a Retina display and hasn't been updated since 2017 - and if you look for a discount on a different model from the 2017 iMac range you will be getting a much better deal.</p>

      </p>
      <p>With this discount you can get an iMac for less than £1,000. Although this is the non-Retina display iMac, with a dual-processor, and it hasn't been updated since 2017, so it's not the most powerful of iMacs, you could probably find a better iMac without paying much more.</p>
