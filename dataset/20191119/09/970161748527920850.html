        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/marcus-rashford/">Marcus Rashford</a> believes his sensational run of goal-scoring form is simply down to getting the consistent run of games he needed to build his confidence.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has scored nine goals in his last 10 games for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> and England, including in each of this last four matches.</p>
      <p>This is a vast improvement as he netted just once in his previous 10 contests for club and country, and the striker says that ‘tough period’ is over thanks to the faith shown in him by his managers.</p>
      <p>‘It has been a tough period and now I’m getting consistent games and playing week in, week out. As a forward that has huge importance,’ said Rashford after scoring in England’s 4-0 win over Kosovo on Sunday.</p>

      <p>‘If you are not in the team and you’re in and out, you don’t quite have that confidence in front of goal.</p>

      <p>‘But when you’re having a run in the team it’s important to come up with the goods and once you start doing that it becomes second nature.’</p>
      <p>Rashford has started all 12 of Manchester United’s Premier League games so far this season, so Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has certainly given him the confidence he needed since the start of the campaign.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian will name Rashford in his starting line-up once again this weekend when the Red Devils face a tough trip to this season’s surprise package Sheffield United on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Former United captain Roy Keane has been impressed with Rashford’s resurgence, and particularly with his goal against Kosovo at the weekend, which the Irishman believes was a sign the striker is ‘back to his best.’</p>
      <p>‘Brilliant, brilliant goal. What a finish,’ Keane said on ITV. ‘He is back to his best. Lovely play, nice and simple.</p>
      <p>‘Does it matter about the opposition? Of course it does, because they’re getting opportunities, but that was the goal of the night, lovely finish. Pure quality.’</p>
