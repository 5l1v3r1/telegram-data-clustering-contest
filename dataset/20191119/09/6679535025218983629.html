      <h1>Tourism Department notifies guidelines to promote home-stays in Puducherry</h1>
      <h2>The move is aimed at attracting more tourists and supplementing the availability of accommodation in Puducherry</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:15:50+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/S-Prasad-736/" target="_blank">S. Prasad</a></address>
      <p>If the Tourism Department’s plan materialises, very soon tourists -- especially foreigners -- visiting the former French outpost, will be able to enjoy a plush home-stay experience in heritage buildings and relish authentic Indian cuisine.</p>
      <p>In an attempt aimed at attracting tourists and supplementing the availability of accommodation in Puducherry, the Tourism Department has come out with guidelines for approval and registration of ‘Puducherry Bed and Breakfast and Home Stay Establishments Scheme’.</p>
      <p>“The basic idea is to provide a clean and affordable place for foreigners and domestic tourists alike including an opportunity for foreign tourists to stay with an Indian family to experience Indian customs and traditions and relish authentic Indian cuisine,” L. Mohamed Mansoor, Director of Tourism said.</p>
      <p>The Department has planned to categorise the Puducherry Bed and Breakfast and Homestay Scheme into ‘silver’ and ‘gold’ categories and rate the establishments based on 37 parameters, which have been listed as both mandatory and desirable.</p>
      <p>An inter-departmental committee will be constituted for approval of establishments. The committee will be headed by the Director of Tourism and has among its members, the Commissioners of respective Municipality/Commune Panchayats, Superintendents of Police covering the respective jurisdiction and Secretary of Hotel Association of Puducherry.</p>
      <p>“Our plan is to promote Puducherry from a weekend getaway to a week-long destination. We have a gap in the availability of rooms. A number of people have already been letting out their rooms for tourists. The idea is to streamline the functioning of such home-stays and provide a fillip to new entrants in the hospitality sector,” Mr. Mansoor said.</p>
      <p>The Bed and Breakfast and Home Stay Establishment is a Central Government scheme and the government earlier had to get approvals from the Centre. Now, the Centre has allowed us to formulate our guidelines and operate the scheme, he added.</p>
      <p>The applications received under the scheme will be scrutinised and cleared by a single-window system within 30 days. A directory of all such approved establishments will be prepared to enable domestic as well as foreign tourists to live in a homely environment and to take advantage of the scheme. The Department has also planned to organise short-term training in the hospitality trade for those who opt for such training, the official added.</p>
      <p>Puducherry attracted 15,31,972 domestic and 1,31,407 foreign tourists in 2017. The figure rose to 16,16,660 domestic tourists and 1,41,133 foreign tourists in 2018 . Till October this year, 14,54,994 domestic and 1,39,359 foreign tourists have visited the region</p>
