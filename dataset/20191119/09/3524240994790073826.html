      <p>A Plateau State High Court  in Jos on Monday granted a former governor of  the  state, Jonah Jang,  a 14-day leave to file his no-case submission.</p>
      <p>Jang and a former cashier in the Office of the Secretary to the State Government, Yusuf Pam, are  being tried  on  17 counts bordering on  corruption and  money laundering amounting to  N6.3bn by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.</p>
      <p>The duo have  pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>
      <p>After  the prosecution called over 12 witnesses,   Jang  through his lead counsel, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), told the court  that he was going to make a no-case submission, stating that   the witnesses and documents had  exonerated him   from  any financial misdeeds.</p>
      <p>Ozekhome said  no case had been established against  the retired military officer  to warrant his  indictment.</p>
      <p>He told the court that they needed 14 days to write a  formal  submission that he had no case to answer  because of the volume of the exhibits and documents tendered at the proceedings which they had to go through.</p>
      <p>
        <i> Justice Daniel Longji adjourned the case  till  December 17,  2019.</i>
