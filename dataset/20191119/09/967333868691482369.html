        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): On the opening day of Indian Parliament’s winter session on Monday, members of Rajya Sabha or House of Elders and former Indian Army top brass were surprised to see a change of uniform for the marshals.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Uniforms of the marshals guarding the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of India's parliament, have undergone changes: traditional Indian outfits with turbans have been replaced by what have widely been perceived as military officer's uniforms, complete with caps, leaving many puzzled.</p>
      <p>India's Former Army Chief, retired <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-marshals-new-uniform-upsets-army-irks-elders-2134655">General Ved Prakash Malik</a> tweeted on Monday that the copying and wearing of military uniforms by non-military personnel was illegal and posed a security hazard, while another former army officer quipped that ‘nothing is sacred anymore’.</p>

      <p>The ​Opposition Congress Party's leader, former federal minister Jairam Ramesh, in turn, wondered if the change of uniform for the marshals to military-style has anything to do with an impending Martial Law, to which the Rajya Sabha Chairman hit back, asking not to raise such insignificant issues.</p>
      <p>Some twitterians went as far as to suggest that having low-end employees dress in uniforms similar to that of top <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201911131077296902-indian-army-to-use-all-weather-robots-for-munitions-delivery-to-avoid-human-casualties-in-kashmir/">Army</a> brass demeans the armed forces.   </p>

      <p>​Junior Minister for Road Transport and Highways and retired General, V.K. Singh said what has been done was wrong.</p>
      <p>But there were some, who felt there was nothing wrong in the new uniform for the marshals of Rajya Sabha – a dignified one on the occasion of its 250th Session.</p>

      <p>​The marshals of both houses of Indian Parliament traditionally wore a white uniform, with turbans. The marshals in the lower house of Parliament continued to wear regular clothes; the change was made only in the upper house.</p>
      <p>The new uniform in dark blue, with shoulder insignias, gold buttons, ornamental braided cord and peaked cap resemble that of the top brass of the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911151077306964-indian-army-asks-officers-to-deactivate-facebook-accounts-stay-away-from-whatsapp-report/">Indian Army</a>. The marshals in Rajya Sabha have more ceremonial duties and assist the Chair.</p>
