      <p>EVERETT — After a fight over a debt of $350, a woman challenged an Everett woman to shoot her.</p>
      <p>She did — firing a gunshot into the money lender’s leg, according to police reports filed in court Monday.</p>
      <p>The lender had gone to a Colby Avenue fourplex Saturday afternoon to confront a man who reportedly owed her cash.</p>
      <p>She spoke with the borrower’s wife, 38, at the door.</p>
      <p>The lender reported the man’s wife refused to pay up, then the wife punched her in the face. The two women fought in the driveway until the husband, the borrower, separated them.</p>
      <p>The wife ran into the house and came back with a .22-caliber revolver and pointed it at the lender’s chest, according to the court papers.</p>
      <p>That’s when the lender said the wife should shoot her.</p>
      <p>The bullet hit the woman’s upper right leg and exited out the back of her leg. She was taken to Providence Regional Medical Center Everett with injuries that weren’t considered life-threatening.</p>
      <p>The borrower and his wife did not cooperate with police at first, court records say.</p>
      <p>The alleged shooter was taken into custody. She then told police the lender attacked her, and her husband had to break up the fight.</p>
      <p>According to the alleged shooter, she ran to her bedroom and grabbed a .22-caliber revolver. She then returned to the door and pointed it “down and to the right of” the woman, while ordering her to leave, she reported.</p>
      <p>The wife denied pointing the gun at the lender’s chest. She reportedly told police she saw the bullet strike the driveway, but that she didn’t think she shot the woman.</p>
      <p>The wife reported she was surprised when the gun went off, because she didn’t know it was loaded.</p>
      <p>Her husband later told police his wife knew the gun was loaded. She loaded it the last time they shot it, he reported.</p>
      <p>The Everett woman is being held for investigation of first-degree assault. An Everett District Court judge set her bail Monday at $10,000. She has no criminal record.</p>
