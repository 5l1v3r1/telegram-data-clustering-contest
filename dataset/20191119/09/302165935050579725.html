      <p>MANAGUA (Nicaragua), Nov 19 — A pro-government mob in Nicaragua broke into a cathedral today and injured two clergy members while attempting to dislodge hunger strikers demanding the release of political prisoners, church authorities said.</p>
      <p>The Catholic Church has a powerful role in the country but President Daniel Ortega has accused bishops of supporting deadly anti-government protests that rocked the country last year.</p>
      <p>A priest and a nun were attacked when they attempted to block the group from taking control of the cathedral in the capital Managua, according to an archdiocese statement. </p>
      <p>“We condemn these acts of intimidation,” the statement said, adding that both victims were in good health after the attack but had left the building as a security measure. </p>
      <p>No further information on the severity of the attack was provided.</p>
      <p>Nine people began a hunger strike in the cathedral on Monday to demand the release of nearly 150 political prisoners.</p>
      <p>The group took refuge in another part of the building to continue their fast after the break-in.</p>
      <p>The Managua Archdiocese asked Ortega to “take immediate steps to ensure that Catholic churches are respected,” and requested that police “withdraw” from the vicinity of the churches.</p>
      <p>More than 325 people were killed and hundreds of government opponents were jailed when street protests were met with a brutal crackdown in Nicaragua last year, according to human rights groups. — AFP</p>
