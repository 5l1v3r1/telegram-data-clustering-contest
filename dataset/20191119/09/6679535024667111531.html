      <p>As part of Children’s Day celebrations, Ford India released a comic book titled ‘Discover more with Ford’ to reach out to children on the importance of road safety.</p>
      <p>With one of the car models of Ford India as the narrator, the book, a statement issued by the company said, would inspire readers to be the change they wish to see in making travel safer.</p>
      <p>“We believe in making every effort possible to ensure that every family travels safely. With this book, we look to put an influencer in each car, persuading others to be courteous and drive safe,” said Kapil Sharma, Director, Communications, Ford India.</p>
      <p>Apart from the book, Ford dealerships were also organising special on-ground engagement zones in showrooms to sensitize children on the significance of road safety. Children visiting dealerships would be given a tour of the service area and would get to wear safety gear specially made for them, a statement issued by the company said.</p>
