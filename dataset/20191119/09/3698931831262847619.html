      <p>Digi’s virtual business phone solution, <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2018/07/31/omni-malaysia-allows-you-to-start-your-own-call-centre-from-rm60-month/">Omni</a>, now supports WhatsApp Business at no extra cost. This will allow existing Omni users to send messages via WhatsApp Business using their existing landline number.</p>
      <p>With WhatsApp Business, business owners on Omni can send broadcast messages to customers without paying for traditional SMS. In addition, it can also be used for automated responses, send quick replies and responses to common FAQs, as well as to alert customers on ongoing promotions or announcements via WhatsApp.</p>

      <p>If you’re new to Omni, it is an enterprise-level virtual phone system which allows you to set up your very own call-centre from as low as RM69/month. You’ll get a fixed landline number and two extensions for the basic plan. When a customer calls the number, they will be greeted by a customisable virtual receptionist that comes with menu options (e.g. press 1 for sales, press 2 for technical assistance, etc).</p>
      <p>Calls can be directed to different team members according to the enquiry and there’s also the option to ring multiple extensions for the team so that no calls will be missed. If customers leave a voicemail, Omni can transcribe the message and have it emailed to you.</p>
      <p>Since Omni is cloud-based, there’s no hardware required and everything is managed via a web dashboard or through the Omni app. For more info, you can check out Omni’s <a href="https://omnihotline.my/">website</a>.</p>
