      <h1>Emmerdale SPOILERS: Kim makes a shocking revelation</h1>
      <h2>What announcement has Kim got to make?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:32:52+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:32</time> by <a rel="author">Claire Crick</a></address>
      <p>Kim Tate has got an announcement to make in next week's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a>... but what is so important that she needs to throw a party to say it?</p>
      <p>Ever since Kim found out that her sidekick and on/off lover <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-graham-foster/">Graham Foster</a> was seeing local vet Rhona Goskirk, she has been vowing to make life a misery for the pair.</p>

      <p>The news that Graham was working his way free of her grip didn't go down well with ice queen Kim, and her jealousy has been clear for everyone to see as Graham and Rhona continue to get closer.</p>
      <p>But next week's Emmerdale sees <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-viewers-fear-for-graham-foster-after-kim-vows-revenge/">Kim's master plan to make life hell for the couple</a> ramp up a gear when she starts meddling with Marlon Dingle.</p>

      <p>Emmerdale fans will already know that Marlon is far from Graham's biggest fan. And so the thought of him spending too much time with little Leo doesn't sit well with the worried dad.</p>

      <p>Knowing that Marlon is already against Graham and Rhona's romance, Kim implies to Marlon that Graham shouldn't be allowed around Leo. But just as she is starting to get through to the Woolpack chef, Rhona arrives and sends Kim packing.</p>
      <p>Rhona is fuming with Marlon for siding with the devil and lays into him... and for the first time Marlon starts to soften towards Graham.</p>
      <p>But his new opinion of Graham doesn't last for long when Kim comes up with another plan to sabotage Graham's happiness.</p>

      <p>As Graham reassures Rhona over her worries about Kim, he is secretly trying to work out what her next move might be. And it seems he doesn't have to wait long to find out, because later he gets a text asking him to come to the Woolpack for an announcement...</p>
      <p>All of Kim's staff have been invited to the pub for the special speech, but when Graham arrives with Rhona his jaw drops when he sees Kim has thrown a party for the occasion.</p>

      <p>Graham quickly realises why Kim has gone to so much effort, and as Kim makes her announcement, Rhona is left seething over what she has just done.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Kim's bombshell clearly doesn't paint Graham in a very good light, because soon he is fighting to apologise to Rhona for what has just happened. But as he tries to explain, Marlon sees red and punches him.</p>
