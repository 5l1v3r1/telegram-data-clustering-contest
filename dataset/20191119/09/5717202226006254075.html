        <b>number of Liverpool fans have taken to Twitter to comment on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-midfielder-adam-lallana-psgs-20896197">recent reports from the Daily Mirror suggesting</a> that Paris Saint-Germain want Adam Lallana.</b>

      <p>Lallana’s future at Anfield has a question mark hanging over it. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-midfielder-adam-lallana-psgs-20896197">The Daily Mirror reports</a> that he is out of contract at the end of the season, and that allows the former Southampton man to discuss a potential summer move with clubs outside England in January.</p>

      <p>The Mirror suggests that Jurgen Klopp may be open to letting Lallana leave Anfield. Apparently, his time out of the team due to injury has shown the Liverpool boss that they can cope without him.</p>
      <p>And the Mirror suggests that Liverpool may appreciate the chance to use his wages – £110,000-a-week, <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1198971/Liverpool-wages-Mohamed-Salah-Sadio-Mane-Roberto-Firmino-Anfield-Premier-League-latest">according to the Express</a> – to help fund a new signing.</p>

      <p>It appears that Lallana is set to be offered the chance to join PSG. The Mirror reports that the Ligue 1 side are looking for a replacement for Edinson Cavani, who is reportedly heading for MLS.</p>
      <p>It is fair to say that plenty of Liverpool fans are somewhat baffled by the reports. Cavani has been one of the most ruthless strikers in Europe for around a decade. Lallana meanwhile, is generally considered a midfielder who has the ability to play as a winger.</p>
      <p>It does not make sense to many that he would be the man to potentially replace Cavani. One fan suggested that it would be like trying to replace James Milner with Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</p>
      <p>Here is how some of the Liverpool supporters have reacted to the rumours…</p>
