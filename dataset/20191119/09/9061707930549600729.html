      <p>The weekend can be very long and lonely if you've no family or friends nearby.</p>
      <p>But a new social group being set up in Derby aims to combat those feelings of loneliness at the weekend by providing a place where people can get together, have a chat and a bite to eat and make new friends.</p>
      <p>The Nibble and Natter group will be held at The Traveller's Rest on Ashbourne Road in Mackworth between 3pm and 5pm on the first Sunday of every month, with the first meeting on Sunday, December 1.</p>
      <p>The group is being run by <a href="https://headhigh.org.uk/">Head High</a> , a charity started by Amanda Solloway to champion mental health awareness, working within the community to make a difference to people's lives.</p>
