      <h1>West Ham predicted team vs Spurs: Roberto starts and Antonio on the bench</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers take on their bitter rivals on Saturday as two under pressure managers square off in east London</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:50:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:50</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>Both Manuel Pellegrini and Mauricio Pochettino are on the proverbial managerial hotseat as the Premier League returns to our lives this weekend following the international break.</p>
      <p>West Ham face Spurs at London Stadium on Saturday lunchtime with the Hammers winless in their last six top flight games while Spurs haven't won away from home since January in the league and, like the Hammers, have just three victories in 12 this season so far.</p>
      <p>Numerous reports are claiming that should Spurs lose to the Hammers then Pochettino, who took the north Londoners to the Champions League final just six months ago, could be clinging to his job.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini meanwhile hasn't seen his team pick up a victory since beating Manchester United on September 22 and has watched his team plummet from fifth in the table to 16th.</p>
      <p>His job isn't in any immediate danger but he needs to turn around the results drastically and get his players back on form after some extremely disappointing displays in their last six games.</p>
      <p>The Hammers boss suffered an injury blow prior to the break as Manuel Lanzini underwent surgery on a fractured collarbone which could rule him out for the rest of 2019. On the flip side, Michail Antonio is back in training but his status for the weekend won't be known until the manager's pre-match press conference on Thursday.</p>
      <p>But that hasn't stopped us predicting a team for the weekend and here it is:</p>

      <p>Our team shows one change from the disappointing 3-0 defeat to Burnley last time out as we have brought back Andriy Yarmolenko for Pablo Fornals in the midfield.</p>
      <p>The big news in our team is that gaffe-prone Roberto keeps his place in goal ahead of David Martin. It's more out of necessity than choice as the manager is unlikely to throw his third-string stopper into the fray despite Roberto's severe struggles since replacing Lukasz Fabianski.</p>
      <p>The back four remains unchanged as Fabian Balbuena kept a morale boosting clean sheet for Paraguay during the international break and keeps his place alongside Issa Diop, who is one booking away from a one-match ban.</p>
      <p>In midfield, a lot depends on the fitness of Mark Noble, who picked up an ankle sprain in the Burnley game. Pellegrini will give an update on his fitness on Thursday but if he doesn't make it, Jack Wilshere could replace him though he still needs to prove his fitness.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p>Up front, Sebastien Haller should lead the line looking to score just his second goal since August and end a lean spell in front of goal, supported by Yarmolenko and Felipe Anderson on the wings. Antonio is likely to start on the bench if he has recovered fully from his torn hamstring that has kept him out of action since August.</p>
