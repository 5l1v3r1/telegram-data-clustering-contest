      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> travel to Old Trafford on December 1 (4.30pm) in their next away trip in the top flight and will be hoping to end a run of three-straight away defeats on the road.</p>

      <p>Some Villa fans harboured hopes that he would come back to B6 for another stint, but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has made him part of the first-team setup this season.</p>
      <p>Indeed, he <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-players-brilliant-gesture-16990083">was even handed the captain's armband for the Carabao Cup clash</a> with Rochdale in September.</p>
      <p>He hasn't featured since October 6, though, missing the past five matches in all competitions through injury.</p>
      <p>But he's well and truly on the comeback trail, posting on Instagram: "Vitamin D. Now it is time to get back on the pitch!"</p>
