      <h1>Dublin Lord Mayor vows to continue fighting proposed tolls and charges</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:29:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>The Lord Mayor of Dublin says he is prepared to fight to the end against a series of charges being considered by Dublin city council.</p>
      <p>A vote last night on next year's budget, which could see increases to parking fees, tolls, commercial rates and council rents, was put back until Monday.</p>
      <p>The local authority says the hikes are needed to deal with a funding gap and increasing costs.</p>
      <p>Councillor Paul McAuliffe says they will be putting pressure on the government:</p>
      <p>"We have until December 1 to pass a budget. If we don't, at that point, Minister Eoghan Murphy will dissolve Dublin City Council.</p>
      <p>"We are prepared to take this right to the brink. It's time Dublin stood up in the national conversation and said 'Dublin has to be treated seriously'.</p>
      <blockquote>We have to fund our capital city and we have to fund the services there.</blockquote>
      <p>"We can't absorb any more cuts," he added.</p>
