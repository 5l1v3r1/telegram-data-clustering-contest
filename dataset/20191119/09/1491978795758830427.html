      <p>Protesters in Hong Kong have been going into the  sewers to escape the Polytechnic University campus they have been occupying since last week, which police have surrounded. About 600 protesters surrendered to authorities overnight, while 200 remain inside the building, which has become the focus of the most prolonged and tense confrontation between police and protesters in more than five months of conflict in the semi-autonomous city.</p>
