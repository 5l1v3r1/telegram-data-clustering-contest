      <p>Jeremy Corbyn will be hoping that tonight’s television debate can give Labour a pre-election boost, with the Conservatives boasting an 11 point lead in the polls.</p>
      <p>The Britain Elects tracker has the Tories on an average of 39.9%, ahead of Labour on 29.0%, with the smaller parties trailing by a significant margin.</p>
      <p>The tracker weights data from various British polling companies to arrive at an industry average – with some polls in the last few days putting the Conservatives ahead by 17 points, compared to eight in others.</p>
      <p>According to the average, the Liberal Democrats are third, on 15.4%, followed by the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> Party, on 7.0%, the Green Party, on 3.2%, and other parties, on 5.5% – with less than a month to go before the December 12 poll.</p>
      <p>Tonight will see the Prime Minister Boris Johnson face Labour leader Mr Corbyn in a live television debate, which Labour hopes can shift momentum back in its favour.</p>

      <p>At the same point in the 2017 election campaign – 23 days before polling day – the tracker had Labour 17 points behind the Conservatives – at around 30%, compared to 47%.</p>

      <p>The polls then narrowed dramatically in their favour.</p>
      <p>Since this election was announced, it has gained some ground along with the Tories, at the expense of the three smaller parties – particularly the Brexit Party.</p>
      <p>The latest data from the tracker suggests the Tories are up 0.8%, Labour 0.2% and the Greens 0.3%; while the Lib Dems are down 0.5% and Brexit Party 0.9%.</p>
      <p>The last poll included in the data is an ICM poll, which also gives the Tories a ten point lead. It surveyed 2,010 people online between November 15 and 18.</p>
      <p>However, the polling industry has been widely slated for its forecasts of the 2017 election – and this year’s vote is seen as particularly difficult to predict, with the Lib Dems and Brexit Party expected to take votes from the main parties in varying numbers in different seats.</p>
      <p>There are also a number of pacts in place in seats locally – many allied across ‘Leave’ and ‘Remain’ lines, making the outcome even harder to call, while the Scottish National Party are again expected to outperform the two main parties north of the border.</p>
      <p>The PM and the leader of the opposition will take part in the ITV debate from 8pm tonight.</p>
