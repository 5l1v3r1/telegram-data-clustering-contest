      <h1>Deezer’s HiFi high-quality streaming tier arrives on mobile</h1>

      <p>Deezer HiFi, the French streaming service’s high-quality tier, is now available on mobile.</p>
      <p>Previously, Deezer’s HiFi tier was only available on the web and desktop.</p>
      <p>The music streaming service on Monday announced that more than 52-million lossless tracks are available to stream via Deezer’s mobile app.</p>
      <p>These tracks are available in uncompressed, lossless FLAC format, and can be downloaded to iOS or Android devices too.</p>
      <p>The company noted that high-quality playback is growing more popular on its platform, with a 45% increase in HiFi listeners in the past year.</p>
      <p>For these higher quality files, there is a price premium too. Subscription to Deezer HiFi will cost R119.99 per month. Users do however get a 30-day free trial.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes after Deezer’s adoption of <a href="http://memeburn.com/2019/10/deezer-360-reality-audio-app/">Sony’s 360 Reality audio format</a>, and the launch of 360 by Deezer.</p>
