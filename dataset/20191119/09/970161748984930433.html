      <p>Rapper T.I. will be Jada Pinkett Smith’s next guest on Red Table Talk after shocking the world by admitting he has his daughter’s hymen checked every year.</p>
      <p>Jada, 48, confirmed T.I. – real name Clifford Joseph Harris Jr – will be appearing on the Facebook Watch series, telling ET: ‘My next big guest is Tip. T.I. is coming to the table. Yes indeed.</p>
      <p>‘And of course, he’s going to address the controversy that has been swirling.’</p>
      <p>The rapper and actor, 39, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/t-brings-18-year-old-daughter-doctor-every-year-check-hymen-tact-11052738/">hit the headlines after he claimed he took his 18-year-old daughter, Deyjah, to the gynaecologist every year to check whether her hymen was still intact.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking on the Ladies Like Us podcast, T.I. said he tries to ensure his daughter’s virginity with the yearly check ups.</p>
      <p>He admitted: ‘I think that most kids in hindsight, looking back, they always thank their parents for not allowing them to damage themselves as much as they could have.</p>

      <p>‘Deyjah’s 18, just graduated high school now and she’s attending her first year of college, figuring it out for herself.</p>

      <p>‘And yes, not only have we had the conversation,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/t-s-wife-tiny-eye-rolls-concern-daughter-deyjah-rapper-admits-gets-hymen-checked-11125895/"> we have yearly trips to the gynaecologist to check her hymen.</a>’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘So it’s this one time we go, I think this might have been after her 16th birthday. This is what we do. Right after the birthday we celebrate.</p>
      <p>‘Usually like the day after the party she’s enjoying her gifts. I put a sticky note on the door: “Gyno. Tomorrow. 9:30.”</p>
      <p>‘So we’ll go and sit down and the doctor will come and talk and the doctor’s maintaining a high level of professionalism.</p>

      <p>‘He’s like, “You know sir, I have to, in order to share information” — I’m like, “Deyjah they want you to sign this so we can share information. Is there anything you wouldn’t want me to know? Oh, ok. See doc, no problem.”</p>
      <p>‘And so then they come and say, “Well I just want you to know that there are other ways besides sex that the hymen can be broken, like bike riding, athletics, horseback riding and just other forms of athletic physical activity.”</p>
      <p>‘I say, “Look doc, she don’t ride no horses, she don’t ride no bike, she don’t play no sports. Just check the hymen please and give me back my results expeditiously”.</p>

      <p>The podcast episode was deleted following the backlash he received for his comments, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/t-s-daughter-deyjah-harris-unfollows-social-media-shocking-hymen-comments-11081240/">and Deyjah has since unfollowed her father on Instagram</a> before <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/deyjah-harris-deletes-instagram-after-dad-t-i-speaks-openly-about-checking-her-virginity-11176445/">deactivating all her social media accounts entirely.</a></p>
      <p>Jada revealed: ‘We just shot that [episode of Red Table Talk] today. And then he and [his wife] Tiny sit down and talk about how they survived, in regards to their marriage. So that will be next Monday.’</p>
      <p>That’s no doubt set to be a very revealing episode indeed…</p>
