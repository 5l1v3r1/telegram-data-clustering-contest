      <p><a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/brendan-o-carroll-rory-leaving-mrs-browns-246323"><i>The hilarious Irish comedian</i></a> would have been left with long lasting cardiac issues only for Dr Alan Byrne saw him struggling with his breath on live television.</p>

      <p>Brendan told <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/news/celebs/mrs-browns-boys-brendan-ocarroll-20909680"><i>RSVP Live</i></a>: "I would have had a heart attack. It wouldn't have killed me but it would have meant I would have a weak heart from then on."</p>
      <p>After being hospitalised, <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/brendan-ocarroll-mrs-browns-boys-christmas-special-rory-cowans-exit-249480"><i>Brendan</i></a> was only made aware of his condition after waking up from the surgery and speaking to doctors.</p>
      <p>"At one stage they had to put me under anesthetic and Jenny was there when I woke up. She told me that they found a blockage in my heart and had put a stent in."</p>

      <p>He continued: "The doctor told me that I was one month away from a heart attack which shocked me."</p>
      <p>Recalling the moment doctors told her of his issues, his wife Jenny explained: "It was like one of those moments from ER or a drama and I was expecting him to say 'We did everything we could' but instead they said they found a blockage,"</p>
      <p>"And he said that they expected to find more. There was only one but it was 99% blocked."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.buzz.ie/competitions/win-tickets-mrs-browns-boys-dmusical-341171"><i>O'Carroll</i> </a>admitted that it was his smoking habits that caused the blockage, "It is the smoking, absolutely!"</p>
      <p>However, Jenny said that he can't give them up just yet, but he is cutting down on them and he isn't going to hide his only vice to professionals.</p>
      <p>She continued: "There is no point saying to the surgeon, 'Oh yeah, I am going to stop smoking'. He is a smoker, he doesn't drink, he doesn't do drugs, he smokes and that is what he does. He said he would do his best and he is doing his best."</p>

      <p>His appearance on The Late Late Show's London special raised concerns with FAI's Dr Alan Byrne who was watching from the Ireland team hotel, as well as those close to him.</p>
      <p>Brendan said: "I remember feeling a bit breathless and for some reason I went down to sneak a smoke and they started saying, 'Come on quick you're on, you're on' and I ran on."</p>
      <p>Jenny added: "After he had surgery, the amount of people and friends that said they saw him on The Late Late Show. "</p>
