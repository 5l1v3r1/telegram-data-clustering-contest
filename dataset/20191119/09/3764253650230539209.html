      <p>As the year gradually spirals to its end, many people anticipate the celebration of the popular Christian holiday known as Christmas.</p>
      <p>Adults might no longer be excited about Christmas as they grow up but kids are usually very happy as the celebration comes closer because they receive gifts from their parents.</p>
      <p>Well, a Twitter user identified as Johnson, got more than what he bargained for after his 10-year-old daughter gave him an interesting list of things she wants for Christmas.</p>
      <p>Apparently, Johnson’s daughter is not yet aware of the realities of life as she wrote her father a Christmas list that included very expensive items that even adults only dream of getting.</p>
