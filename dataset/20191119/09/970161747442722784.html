        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> are looking to give new deals to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tammy-abraham/">Tammy Abraham</a>, Fikayo Tomori, Reece James and Tino Anjorin as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/frank-lampard/">Frank Lampard</a> continues to build his team around the exciting young prospects at Stamford Bridge.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Abraham and Tomori have been regulars in the Blues first team in the Premier League and Champions League this season, while James has also been called into first team action.</p>
      <p>17-year-old midfielder Anjorin is the least recognisable name of the four and has made just one appearance in the senior side, in the 7-1 EFL Cup win over Grimsby.</p>
      <p>Lampard is a big fan of all four and wants to tie their futures down at Chelsea for the foreseeable future, reports <a href="https://www.goal.com/g00/en-ug/news/chelsea-in-talks-to-extend-willians-deal-despite-barcelona/dccm0n9a83l01nj0a8fl1pgp6?i10c.ua=1&amp;i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3d&amp;i10c.dv=12">Goal</a>, as they continue to impress early in their careers.</p>
      <p>Abraham has been in spectacular form so far this season, scoring 10 Premier League goals, second only to Jamie Vardy in the race for the Golden Boot.</p>

      <p>Tomori has stepped up to the first team and made 14 appearances across all competitions, also making his England debut on Sunday against Kosovo.</p>

      <p>Given he plays in the same position as club captain Cesar Azpilicueta, right-back James has been more limited in terms of first team options, but has still made nine appearances this campaign, scoring two goals.</p>
      <p>Also set for a new contract offer is Willian who has been in tremendous form since Lampard took over as manager in the summer.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old Brazilian captained the side in their last outing against Crystal Palace and has been integral to the Blues’ fine run of results in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Willian is out of contract in the summer and has previously been linked with Barcelona, who could make a move to sign him in January, but he given his resurgence under Lampard, he is now likely to stay in west London.</p>
      <p>He told DAZN: ‘The only real offer I had to leave Chelsea came from Barcelona last year, after the World Cup. Barca presented an offer to Chelsea but it was rejected.</p>
      <p>‘That was the only time I ever had to discuss something like that with my family, but we really love it here [in London]. So there were several factors that helped me stay.’</p>

      <p>Lampard has also made it clear he wants the play-maker to stay, saying earlier this month: ‘The word isn’t ‘no-brainer’ because I can’t get involved in the money, that’s up to the club to do.</p>
      <p>‘But everyone sees how much I’m relying on him and what he’s producing. I love him at this football club, so there’s my answer.’</p>
