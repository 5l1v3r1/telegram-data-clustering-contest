      <h1>Exclusive! Impressed by Ajay Devgn, Kajol's Marathi in 'Tanhaji-The Unsung Warrior' trailer? Meet the Bollywood actor who trained them</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:12:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Tejashree-Bhopatkar-479228026.cms" target="_blank">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>The massive trailer of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ajay-Devgn">Ajay Devgn</a>'s 'Tanhaji-The Unsung Warrior' has already hit the internet and after watching the promising trailer, we are sure fans are now eagerly waiting with the bated breath to see 'Tanhaji' on big screens. While it is Ajay Devgn's second biographical drama post'The Legend of Bhagat Singh', <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kajol">Kajol</a> will be seen for the first time in any period film, essaying a legendary role and we must say both did pure justice to the roles they played. All thanks to their dedication and the man who helped them polish their outstanding craft with some acting and dialect lessons.</p>
      <p>If you are impressed with their dialogue delivery and Marathi dialect in the trailer, the makers should thank this Bollywood actor, who helped them master their role. Ashish Pathode, who also happens to a Bollywood actor and has acted in films like 'Thackeray', 'Azhar' and some Marathi films have trained Ajay Devgn, Kajol, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sharad-Kelkar">Sharad Kelkar</a> to get their Marathi dialect correct. Speaking exclusively to Etimes, Ashish said, "I was the acting and dialect coach for Ajay sir, Kajol ma'am, Saif sir, Sharad Kelkar and Neha Sharma." When asked further about his experience in training the star cast, an overwhelmed Ashish said, "It was a very nice experience. Basically, I got to learn more from them. They are such a huge star with such a great experience, there is a lot to learn from them. Despite being such a great actors, they obeyed and listened to me is the most impressive thing about them. They have a lot of patience I must say. Since I am a trained student from NSD, I was appointed to guide them on portraying these legendary characters which they were not familiar to."</p>

      <p>"Everyone is a quick learner, Be it Ajay sir, Kajol ma'am or Saif sir. They have worked so much in the industry that the patience level and an the urge to learn something new is present in them. I still remember Ajay sir saying to me that, 'I am understanding the thing, you have told me, but I don't know whether it is happening or no'. This is something commendable that a man with such a great stature is saying this to me. It feels different to hear such words from an actor who is so experienced. Ajay sir always kept a friendly atmosphere on the sets and kept the hierarchy thing away, which made him super," concluded Ashish.</p>
      <p>Helmed by Om Raut, the movie also stars Padmavati Rao, Sharad Kelkar, Luke Kenny and others in pivotal roles. This biographical film is set to hit the theatres on January 10, 2019.</p>
