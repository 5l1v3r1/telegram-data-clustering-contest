      <p>​The book, “<i>Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us</i>”, debuted at No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list on 13 November.</p>
      <p>This first literary effort by Trump, Jr. is said to offer his perception of the left and the tactics they employ, according to the author, to “oust conservatives out of the public arena”.</p>
      <p>Among those <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911141077304863-bulk-bought-out-by-wh-whirlwind-of-lulz-as-trump-sings-praises-of-sons-bestselling-book/">celebrating the book sales</a> was President Donald Trump, who tweeted:</p>
      <p>“Wow! Was just told that my son’s book, ‘Triggered,’ is Number One on The New York Times Bestseller List. Congratulations Don!”</p>

      <h3>No. 1 on NY Times Bestseller List</h3>
      <p>Currently, "Triggered" sits atop The New York Times nonfiction bestseller list and has reportedly outsold the combined sales of the Number 2 and Number 3 top books on the list.</p>
      <p>The Times appended a dagger (†) to the book's title, indicating its belief the book made its way onto its bestseller list in a way that seems “suspicious".</p>
      <p>In this case, most of "Triggered's" sales appear to come from bulk purchases and not individual sales.</p>
      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201911111077278763-donald-trump-jr-book-supporters/">Donald Trump Jr has responded</a> to critics’ suggestions that sales of his book are being artificially boosted by deploring the fact the Times placed a "deadly dagger" next to his book's title and claiming the newspaper does that "to a lot of conservative books".</p>
