      </p>
      <p>Offering a new type of crypto debit card that instantly converts cryptocurrency into USD, <a href="https://epay-x.com/">EPAY-X</a> is making it easier than ever before to spend crypto online and in physical retail locations as well. With no commissions taken on internal transactions and several different options for topping up the balance of a card, EPAY-X is challenging traditional fee models used by crypto-based debit cards.</p>

      <p>The goal of the young company, founded by e-commerce and internet business professionals, is to provide a nearly fee-free, highly secure crypto-to-fiat solution that is available to residents of almost every country around the world.</p>
      <p>EPAY-X performs multiple steps of the currency conversion process all at once so its users don’t have to endure the hassle of going through a cryptocurrency exchange in order to convert their coins into spendable cash.</p>
      <p>In addition to acting as a debit card that can be used at retail locations and ATMs in over 100 countries, members can use their card to pay for services on the internet, process employee payrolls, accept payments from others, and pay for almost any other type of purchase.</p>
      <h3>A Crypto Debit Card with Zero-to-Low Fees, Numerous Deposit and Withdrawal Options</h3>
      <p>Currently, EPAY-X supports loading via USD, GBP, EUR, Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC), with plans to adopt support for several other major cryptocurrencies in the near future. EPAY-X features zero fees for any type of balance top-up, including deposits made with SEPA transfers, Perfect Money, or Payeer.</p>
      <p>Withdrawal fees are only $1 using their prepaid card, or 1% if using Perfect Money or Payeer, making them one of the most competitive crypto debit cards available as far as withdraws are concerned. After a user account has been verified, there are no restrictions on wallet refills or internal transfers.</p>
      <h3>Generous Rewards and Competent Investment Program for a Growing Account Balance</h3>
      <p>In addition to offering a referral program where users can get 10% of fees generated by referred users and capital they entrust with EPAY-X, they also offer the opportunity to transfer funds into a fund management program to multiply their investment. Profits from the investment program are dependent on fluctuations of the global market, of which cryptocurrency is expected to take an ever-increasing percentage of lasting well into the future.</p>
      <p>EPAY-X offers two investment options: Forex and Cryptocurrency. Returns from the Forex plan are distributed once every year, whereas returns from the Cryptocurrency plan are distributed once every six months.</p>
      <h3>Designed and Built with Security in Mind</h3>
      <p>By focusing on fraud protection, data encryption, and customer privacy, EPAY-X is heavy on security, offering both individual and legal entity-type customers peace of mind when loading, storing and spending their funds. The process of setting up an account is free and easy.</p>
      <p>ID verification is required before physical debit cards can be mailed out, but after the verification process is completed (usually within 24 hours), users can place an order for a physical debit card based on MasterCard technology, and enjoy limit-free access to their account.</p>
