      <p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) says the deadly attacks against Sudanese protesters calling for democratic change in June were planned and could amount to crimes against humanity.</p>
      <p>The rights group is calling upon Sudan’s transitional government to conduct independent investigations and “commit to genuine accountability for unlawful violence against protesters since December, in which hundreds were killed.”</p>
      <h3>“They were shouting ‘kill them'”</h3>
      <p>In a 59-page report, entitled  <i><a href="https://www.hrw.org/node/335646/">“‘They Were Shouting ‘Kill Them’’’: Sudan’s Violent Crackdown on Protesters in</a></i><a href="https://www.hrw.org/node/335646/"> Khartoum</a>, Human Rights Watch accuses Sudanese security forces of carrying out a planned attack against protesters in the capital on 3 June, 2019, and the days that followed in other neighbourhoods of the capital and nearby Bahri and Omdurman.</p>
      <p>“The violence by Sudanese forces in the lead up to, during and following, the June 3 attack has killed hundreds of people, and was part of a pattern of using excessive force to disperse protests,” the report says. “Authorities did not use proportionate force or take feasible measures to ensure that operations posed a minimal risk to life.”</p>
      <p>“Shooting was clearly targeted and intentional…; they directed their guns at us… they were shouting ‘kill them, kill them’ all the time. I saw many bodies hit by bullets while I was running,” one witness is quoted as saying in the report.</p>
      <p>In a separate statement regarding the report, HRW directly accuses security forces in Sudan of planning the attack against protesters.</p>
      <p>“Fatal attacks on protesters in Sudan in June were planned and could amount to crimes against humanity, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today,” the rights group said on Monday.</p>
