      <h1>Wits To Turn To MDC Team For Players</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:13:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:13</time> by <a rel="author">Mazola Molefe</a></address>
      <p>Gavin Hunt says Bidvest Wits will be forced to strengthen the squad to manage their congested fixture list early next year, but don’t expect the Clever Boys to spend big.</p>
      <p>“We need more numbers, and we had players that left and we couldn’t replace – Robyn Johannes and Fagrie Lakay were registered for CAF and Simon Murray is out for the rest of the season,” the coach said.</p>

      </p>
      <p>With Wits progressing to the group stages of the CAF Confederation Cup and still determined to be among the Absa Premiership title challengers here at home, it means Hunt’s squad is stretched and their depth will be tested.</p>
      <p>“We have terrible trips. None of them are one-stop trips – it’s two or three stop flights. Remember when you go there you still have to get flights back,” he said of their matches away against Djoliba (Mali), Al Nasr (Libya, likely to be played in Tunisia or Egypt) and Horoya (Guinea) in Group C of the competition.</p>
      <p>“We play (one of the matches) December 29 as well, the only day we going to have off is Christmas Day. We have to strengthen a bit because we don’t have the squad to deal with our schedule at the moment. We had 25 players and now we are down to 17-18. We can register five now, but we are still short. But what can you do? The only place I can take from is our Diski Challenge team and will see where else,” said Hunt.</p>
