      <h1>Gerwyn Price: I was in form of my life</h1>
      <h2>Gerwyn Price said he produced the darts of his life to secure his second successive victory at the Grand Slam of Dart in Wolverhampton.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:05:23+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/russell-youll/" target="_blank">Russell Youll</a></address>
      <p>Price, who swatted away the challenge by Peter Wright in dominant fashion to emerge victorious in a 16-6 rout on Sunday night, was simply unstoppable as he collected the Eric Bristow Trophy at Aldersley Leisure Village.</p>
      <p>The Welshman went into the final after a brilliant maiden career victory over Michael van Gerwen in the semi-finals – who he had never previously defeated in 18 previous career meeting.</p>
      <p>Price then etched his name his name into the record books with a relentless demolition of Wright to claim back-to-back Grand Slam wins, averaging 107.86 and hitting 11 180s during a remarkable display.</p>
      <p>“I’m chuffed to bits,” said an emotional Price, who picked up £125,000 as champion plus a £3,500 group winner bonus following a flawless week.</p>
      <p>“I knew in the middle of the game that I was playing really well. I was hitting trebles for fun and putting Peter under pressure and he wasn’t playing his best. I was that I was at the top of my game and I felt comfortable all the way through that game.</p>
      <p>“I’m chuffed to bits to get this again and finally have the crowd cheer this time. This week they’ve been fantastic – I’m not used to this but they truly have got behind me this weekend and I appreciate it.”</p>
      <p>The tournament victory means Price also moves up to third on the PDC Order of Merit, and he added: “I’ve had a good year, 18 months, but it doesn’t happen all the time. I’m just thankful to win this again.”</p>
      <p>Scottish ace Wright had defeated Price to win his only televised ranking title at the 2017 UK Open, but was this time left to admit: “I had no answer.</p>
      <p>“Beating Michael and then the way he played there, I thought he was trying for the record [average in a final].</p>
      <p>“I was chasing him all the way through, and when he missed I was lucky if I was on 100-and-something! He played fantastic all the way through.”</p>
      <p>Wright had switched darts ahead of the event to a style similar to that used by Phil Taylor towards the end of the Stoke legend’s career, and was happy with his performances in reaching the final.</p>
      <p>“I switched to these darts and I said to myself that I think I can get to the final with them, and I got to the final,” he added. “It’s a stepping stone.”</p>
