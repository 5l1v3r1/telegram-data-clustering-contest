      <h1>Air pollution leads to five premature deaths a week in Bristol</h1>
      <h2>Lawrence Hill stood out as an area having some of the highest levels of deprivation and air pollution in Bristol</h2>

      <p>Air pollution contributes to the premature death of five Bristolians every week, new research suggests.</p>
      <p>A team from King’s College London looked at the effect of the two most harmful forms of air pollution - nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and PM2.5 - in Bristol.</p>
      <p>PM2.5 are tiny particles released mainly by wood smoke, coal burning, and industrial combustion. They can lodge in people’s lungs and cause very serious health conditions. </p>
      <p>In cities, NO2 comes mainly from older polluting vehicles. </p>
      <p>The researchers found that, together, high levels of PM2.5 and NO2 contribute to up to 260 premature deaths each year in Bristol, according to a report released today (November 18).</p>
      <p>While the deaths are mainly among older people, the results mean a child born in 2011 could die up to six months earlier if exposed over their lifetimes to air pollution, even taking into account expected reductions in air pollution until 2030.</p>
      <p>The research, commissioned by UK100, a network of local authority leaders which campaigns on clean air, comes as <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-council">Bristol City Council</a> waits to hear from the government on its outline plans to reduce toxic levels of NO2 in the city.</p>
      <p>The council has proposed introducing a ban on privately owned diesel vehicles in the inner city and a wider charging zone for older, more polluting buses, taxis and other commercial vehicles.</p>
      <p>The new research also comes as <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-mayor">Bristol Mayor</a> <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/marvin-rees">Marvin Rees</a> and UK100 convene a Clean Air Summit in City Hall later today (November 18).</p>
      <p>Key organisations from across the city have been invited to discuss the impact of the council’s clean air proposals and suggest possible ways to alleviate its worst effects.</p>

      <p>Mr Rees said: “This research emphasises how vital it is that we act quickly to improve health and save lives in Bristol. </p>
      <p>“Our proposed plans for a combination of a small area diesel ban and medium sized Clean Air Zone gets us to legal air quality levels in the shortest possible time minimising the adverse impact on our lowest income households. </p>
      <p>“We have submitted the plan. We now need government to act strongly to support us to deliver.”</p>
      <p>Previous research has estimated that NO2 and PM2.5 leads to up to 36,000 deaths a year in the UK, and contributes to a wide range of health conditions including asthma, lung cancer, heart disease, strokes and, possibly, diabetes.</p>
      <p>The study found Bristol had higher levels of PM2.5 pollution than Liverpool City and Greater Manchester, but a lower death rate and a smaller population.</p>
      <p>Lawrence Hill stood out as an area having some of the highest levels of deprivation and air pollution in Bristol as well as the highest Black and minority ethnic population in the city.</p>
      <p>Bristol North West had the highest annual number of premature deaths from PM2.5 and NO2.</p>
      <p>The pollutants were estimated to contribute to 64 to 82 deaths per year in the north west of the city, compared with 51 to 70 in the south, 47 to 61 in the east and 38 to 47 in the west.</p>
      <p>Dr David Dajnak, principal air quality scientist, environmental research group at King's College London, said: “This report shows that more needs to be done to address the level of threat air pollution poses to health in Bristol and highlights that the highest level of air pollution in Bristol coincides with zones of exceptional population growth and areas having the highest black and minority ethnic population.”</p>

      <p>The report estimated that the total cost to the NHS and social care of air pollution in Bristol is up to £170 million a year.</p>
      <p>Polly Billington, director of UK100, said: “This data shows why we need clear and binding targets for every city in the UK to be compliant with WHO pollution guidelines to prevent deaths from air pollution. </p>
      <p>“Bristol are taking action, but they need support and funding, including from businesses and central Government in order to expand on their planned Clean Air Zone.”</p>
      <p>UK100 is supporting major cities across the country to introduce ambitious ‘Clean Air Zones’ to tackle air pollution from polluting cars, HGVs, vans and buses.  </p>
      <p>In London, an “ultra low emissions zone” introduced earlier this year has already reduced levels of NO2 pollution by 29 per cent.</p>
      <p>A recent Global Clean Air Summit hosted by UK100 and the Mayor of London, business and political leaders agreed to the adoption of World Health Organization recommended air pollution limits as legally binding targets to be achieved by 2030.</p>
