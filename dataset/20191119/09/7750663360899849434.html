      <p>Kansas City lost wide receiver <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tyreek-hill/"><b>Tyreek Hill</b></a> and starting running back <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/damien-williams/"><b>Damien Williams</b></a> to injuries but Daniel Sorensen's end zone interception of a pass by Chargers quarterback <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/philip-rivers/"><b>Philip Rivers</b></a> with 18 seconds left on the clock meant the Chiefs held on for the win.</p>
      <p>The result sees the Chiefs (7-4) cement their position on top of the AFC West table with the Chargers, whose touchdown came from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/keenan-allen/"><b>Keenan Allen</b></a>, on 4-7 and stuck in third place in the same division.</p>
      <p>The clash at the Azteca Stadium was the 10th NFL game staged in Mexico City, and first since 2017.</p>
