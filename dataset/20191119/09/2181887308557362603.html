      <h1>US gov grants Huawei another 90-day reprieve</h1>
      <h2>Hip hip Huawei</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:38:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theinquirer.net/author/profile/2353/carly-page" target="_blank">Carly Page</a></address>
      <p><b>THE US GOVERNMENT </b>has handed Huawei another 90-day license extension that allows it to continue doing business with American firms. </p>
      <p>The move, which sees Huawei receive its third three-month extension, comes after <i><a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huawei-tech/u-s-expected-to-grant-huawei-90-day-license-extension-monday-sources-idINKBN1XS0CV">Reuters</a> </i>reported that the Trump administration had backtracked on previous plans to grant Huawei a measly two-week extension of its licence.</p>
      <p>In a statement given to <i>INQ</i>, Huawei shrugged off the decision, noting that it "won't have a substantial impact on Huawei's business either way."</p>
      <p>"This decision does not change the fact that Huawei continues to be treated unfairly either," a spokesperson said. "We have long held that the decision by the US Department of Commerce to add Huawei to the Entity List has caused more harm to the US than to Huawei.</p>
      <p>"This has done significant economic harm to the American companies with which Huawei does business and has already disrupted collaboration and undermined the mutual trust on which the global supply chain depends. We call on the US government to put an end to this unjust treatment and remove Huawei from the Entity List."</p>
      <p>These comments have merit, too; despite losing an entire continent,  which forced it <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3080943/huawei-mate-30-no-google-apps-ban">to launch its latest flagship phone without Google Play Services</a>, Huawei remains in a pretty good place. <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3082674/huawei-smartphone-sales-2019-us-ban">Sales have continued to be buoyant</a> and profits are moving in the right direction.</p>
      <p>While Huawei doesn't seem too fussed, this latest 90-day extension will likely be welcomed by smaller, rural mobile operators, who continue to rely on Huawei equipment as it's cheaper than kit offered by its competitors. </p>
      <p>Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told <i>Fox Business Network</i> last week: "There are enough problems with telephone service in the rural communities - we don't want to knock them out. So, one of the main purposes of the temporary general licenses is to let those rural guys continue to operate."</p>
      <p>However,  Attorney General William Barr said that Huawei and ZTE  "cannot be trusted" and that US rural wireless carriers should be banned from using an $8.5bn  government fund to purchase services or telecom equipment from these Chinese firms. µ</p>
