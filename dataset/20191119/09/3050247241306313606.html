      <h1>Willy Woo: $8K Bearish Bitcoin Price in ‘Unique Setup’ Before Halving</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) barely managed to maintain $8,000 support on Nov. 19 as analysts warn the outlook for markets is increasingly bearish. </p>

      <h3>Bitcoin sheds 3.7% overnight</h3>
      <p>Data from Coin360 showed BTC/USD bounce off lows of $8,077 on Tuesday, having spent the time since the weekend <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-in-golden-pocket-as-trader-warns-of-7-400-breakdown">eroding previous gains</a>. </p>
      <p>On Monday, a sudden dip took the pair below $8,100 for the first time since late October, with price action fluctuating around that level since. </p>
      <p>At press time, a slight reversal had taken Bitcoin back to $8,150, with daily losses still at 3.7% and weekly losses totaling almost 7%.</p>

      <h3>Woo: Bitcoin “won’t repeat past halvings”</h3>
      <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, analysts revealed they had cause for concern for Bitcoin price — not just in the short term — but even after the May 2020 block reward halving.</p>
      <p>“I expect way more volatility. Short term bearish is all I'm saying. And don't expect price will repeat past halvenings,” statistician <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1196473964014424064">Willy Woo</a> summarized in a Twitter update on Monday. </p>
      <p>Woo was referring to historical trends in Bitcoin, which saw its two previous halvings — in 2012 and 2016 — come after several months of bullish price action.</p>
      <p>Previously, sentiment likewise favored the 2020 event as a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-most-dramatic-2020-halving-could-cut-supply-by-63m-a-week">bullish turning point</a>, with markets entering a highly bullish phase thereafter. This time, however, the bears are in control.</p>
      <p>“Well this time around, we have gone $14k-&gt;$7.5k and that's killing off weak miners who are dumping and dying,” Woo explained. He added: </p>
      <blockquote>“This adds to the already bearish action, so no happy front running 6-months out due to sell pressure. You can't draw repeat fractals, the fundamentals are different.”</blockquote>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-8k-bounce-now-aligns-perfectly-with-stock-to-flow-chart">reported</a>, a traditionally accurate Bitcoin price model still calls for an average BTC/USD price of $8,300 until the halving. </p>
      <h3>Altcoins see heavy losses in more volatile trading</h3>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin">Altcoin</a> traders meanwhile suffered similar punishment to Bitcoiners on Tuesday, with many major cryptocurrencies shedding around 5% of their value. </p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), the largest altcoin by market cap, fell just over 3% to hit $177. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Others fared worse, with EOS (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/eos-price-index">EOS</a>) down 6.7%, Tron (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tron">TRX</a>) 7.5% and Cardano (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cardano">ADA</a>) 7.2%. The latter thus reversed the gains it made on Monday when it sealed roughly 4% gains.</p>
      <p>The overall cryptocurrency market cap was $228.7 billion at press time, down $6 billion in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s share stood at 66%.</p>
