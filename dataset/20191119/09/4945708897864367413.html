      <p>A US congressional committee on Monday asked for a briefing on a Google project to modernize healthcare while giving the internet titan access to millions of people's medical data.</p>
      <p>Energy and Commerce Committee leaders sent letters to the chiefs of Google and its partner in the <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/project/">project</a>, US health systems non-profit Ascension, requesting to be briefed by December 6.</p>
      <p>The California-based internet giant last week revealed a project code-named "Nightingale," evidently in tribute to Florence Nightingale, whose nursing work during the Crimean War in the 1850s is credited with turning such work into a profession.</p>
      <p>"We are happy to cooperate with any questions about the project," Google said in response to an AFP inquiry.</p>
      <p>"We believe Google's work with Ascension adheres to industry-wide regulations (including HIPAA) regarding patient data and comes with strict guidance on data privacy, security, and usage."</p>
      <p>Google has made no secret of its work with <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/health+care+providers/">health care providers</a> on computing tools to improve <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/patient+care/">patient care</a>.</p>
      <p>Google's collaboration with Ascension includes moving data and analytics to a private, secure cloud hosted by the internet firm.</p>
      <p>Ascension could also use Google computing tools to allow employees to communicate and collaborate securely in real time from different sites, according to a post by Google cloud industry products and solutions president Tariq Shaukat.</p>
      <p>"To be clear: under this arrangement, Ascension's data cannot be used for any other purpose than for providing these services we're offering under the agreement, and <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/patient+data/">patient data</a> cannot and will not be combined with any Google consumer data," Shaukat said.</p>
      <p>Google disclosed little about what it is testing in Project Nightingale as it competes to be the preferred platform for patients and care providers.</p>
      <p>The cloud team works with dozens of healthcare service providers on technology to analyze <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/medical+data/">medical data</a> and make it readily available to patients and those treating them, according to the company.</p>
      <p>"While we appreciate your efforts to provide the public with further information about Project Nightingale, this initiative raises serious privacy concerns," the committee said in letters to Ascension and Google.</p>
      <p>"Longstanding questions related to Google's commitment to protecting the privacy of its own users' data raise serious concerns about whether Google can be a good steward of patients' personal health information."</p>
      <p>The US Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Health and Human Services is also reported to be looking into the project.</p>
