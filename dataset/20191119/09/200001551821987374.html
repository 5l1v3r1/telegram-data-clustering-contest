      <h1>Club ‘very attentive’ to Nuno decisions – Defender could leave Wolves as early as January</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:35:09+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Jesus Vallejo’s loan move to Wolves isn’t working out as well as Real Madrid had expected, report <a href="https://www.defensacentral.com/real_madrid/1574013974-noticia-dc-la-situacion-de-vallejo-complica-mucho-a-zidane">Defensa Central</a>.</p>
      <p>According to their own information, DC say there’s worry at the Spanish club about the lack of minutes the 22 year old is getting. The plan was that he’d be a prominent player for Wolves in the Premier League, yet he’s only managed 162 minutes so far.</p>
      <p>This disrupts Real Madrid’s plan to take Vallejo back next summer and have him as their fourth choice central defender.</p>
      <p>Wolves don’t get any blame and there doesn’t appear to be any bitterness, with it being pointed out the club have recovered from a poor start to the season and are finding the formula which works best for them.</p>
      <p>As it stands, that doesn’t include Vallejo and it could therefore see the young defender leave as early as the winter market. Even if he stays until next summer, then it’s thought a further loan would be the best scenario, with staying in Spain seen as the most preferable outcome.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid are currently ‘very attentive’ to Nuno Espirito Santo’s decisions, clearly hoping the situation changes.</p>
