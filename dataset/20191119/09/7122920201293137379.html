      <h1>A new home for Japan’s startups</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Agnieszka Hryniewicz-Bieniek</a></address>
      <p>Japan has always been a nation of forward thinkers. From the bullet train and the walkman to the lithium ion battery, Japanese ideas have shaped the modern world—and now a new generation of Japanese entrepreneurs is carrying on that legacy, building businesses around technology like artificial intelligence and machine learning.  </p>
      <p>To support these talented founders as they grow and scale globally, we’re opening the doors on a <a href="https://www.campus.co/tokyo/ja/">Google for Startups</a> Campus in Tokyo. Joining a <a href="https://www.campus.co/">worldwide network</a> with locations from London to São Paulo to Seoul, it’s a platform for Japanese startups to develop their ideas, access Google resources, and build connections with like-minded entrepreneurs.  </p>
      <p>We’ve been supporting Japanese startups for some time now: <a href="https://cinnamon.is/en/">Cinnamon</a> uses AI to help businesses work more efficiently and <a href="https://www.lilymedtech.com/en/">Lily MedTech</a> is working on a device that could better detect breast cancer at an early stage. The new Campus means we’re better able to help many more founders as they take their ventures forward. It’s co-located with our new office in Shibuya, so we can offer Google training, mentoring and tools. And it’ll provide a welcoming, inclusive environment for startups from all backgrounds. Over 37% of our Campus members globally are women—a higher percentage than in most other parts of the startup community, but one we’re working hard to increase every year. </p>
      <p>Starting in 2020, the Tokyo Campus will also be home to a new <a href="https://www.campus.co/tokyo/ja/accelerator/">Google for Startups Accelerator</a>, an intensive three-month boot camp for startups working in AI. The goal of the Accelerator program is to give founders with established products the tools to prepare for the next phase of growth, and ultimately contribute to a stronger Japanese economy. We’re confident the program’s focus on AI and machine learning will advance ways of applying technology to tackle social, economic and environmental challenges—an area where we believe Japan can lead the world. <a href="https://www.campus.co/tokyo/en/accelerator-en/">Applications open today</a>.</p>

      <p>The launch of a Google for Startups Campus in Tokyo is part of a bigger story, with Japan making technology, digital skills, and AI central to its ambitions for the future. Eighteen years ago, Japan was where we opened the first Google office outside the United States. Today, our team here is much bigger, but we're just as focused on making sure Japan has the digital tools and services it needs. We're helping Japanese businesses adopt cloud computing. We're supporting AI research at academic institutions and universities. And we've committed to train 10 million Japanese workers in digital skills by 2022, through the <a href="https://grow.google/intl/ALL_jp/">Grow with Google</a> program we launched earlier this year. </p>
      <p>We’re looking forward to Campus contributing to these efforts, giving Japanese startups the opportunity to make their ideas real—and continue shaping the world like so many of Japan’s entrepreneurs before them. </p>
