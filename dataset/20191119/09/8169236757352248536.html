        <b>Former Sky Sports host Richard Keys has aimed a swipe at current pundit Jamie Carragher in a rare interview.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The presenter, now with beIN Sports in Qatar, has discussed his infamous exit from Sky after he and co-host Andy Gray were recorded making sexist comments about Sian Massey-Ellis.</p>

      <p>Keys insists, however, that his crimes were not nearly as bad as those of former Liverpool defender Carragher.</p>
      <p>The ex-England international was notably suspended by the broadcaster for spitting at a young fan from his car window.</p>
      <p>However, unlike Keys, he was allowed to return to Sky later, with the incident rather brushed under the carpet.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1387749/2019/11/19/dinosaurs-ruled-the-world-for-300-million-years-so-if-thats-what-i-am-so-be-it-keys-and-gray-on-life-after-sky/">The Athletic</a>, he said: “Look at the things that have happened. I didn’t go downstairs to the dressing room door, knock on it and spit in her face. And yet the guy that committed a criminal offence in a public arena, spitting in the face of a 14-year-old girl, was later welcomed back by Sky as a hero.</p>
      <p>“Now, come on. Are there any similarities? I don’t think so.”</p>
