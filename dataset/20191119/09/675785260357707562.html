      <h1>PSG owners 'close in on Leeds United takeover' as boardroom talks continue</h1>
      <h2>PSG owners Qatari Sports Investment are interested in taking control of Championship side Leeds and recent talks are thought to have becoming increasingly positive</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:27:04+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:27</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>The owners of Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly closing in on a takeover of Leeds United.</p>
      <p>Qatari Sports Investment (QSI) are interested in investing in the Championship side who are currently bidding for a first return to the Premier League since being relegated in 2004.</p>
      <p>Discussions between the would-be investors and Leeds have been ongoing since before the summer and - while nothing is finalised - recent talks have been positive, report <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/leeds-united/story/3992916/psg-owners-closing-in-on-leeds-united-takeover-sources">ESPN FC.</a></p>
      <p>Leeds owner Andrea Radrizzani also has interest from two other parties but his close relationship with PSG chief Nasser al-Khelaifi means QSI are in pole position to strike a deal.</p>

      <p>An agreement is not thought to be imminent, with uncertainty over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> , the difficult situation at Al-Khelaifi-owned beIN Sport and the diplomatic landscape in Qatar all thought to be contributing factors to the delay.</p>
      <p>Radrizzani is also keen to get the right deal for himself and Leeds having paid almost Â£40million for full control at Elland Road in May 2017.</p>
      <p>QSI have reportedly been interested in getting involved in an English club for some time, considering a bid to take over Queens Park Rangers before deciding Leeds would be a better opportunity.</p>

      <p>The worldwide appeal of the Premier League - where Leeds see themselves returning - and the astronomical TV revenue that comes with it make the Yorkshire club an attractive proposition.</p>
      <p>Leeds and Qatar have already collaborated in a number of ways including a partnership with Doha's ultra-modern football academy Aspire where Whites youth teams travel for training and tournaments.</p>
      <p>Leeds currently sit third in the Championship under boss Marcelo Bielsa, only out of the top two on goal difference and just two points adrift of table-topping West Brom.</p>
      <p>They missed out on promotion to the top flight last term as faltering late-season form saw them slip into the playoffs where they were beaten by Derby over two legs in the semi-finals.</p>
