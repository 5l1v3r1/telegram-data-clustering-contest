      <p>Derby County have been blessed with many a great players represent the club down the years.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, we asked <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Rams </a>supporters to pick which winger they would have back at the club in their prime.</p>
      <p>Alan Hinton, Ted McMinn, Nigel Callaghan, Paul Simpson and Gary Micklewhite were the options to chose from and Rams fans have been debating which they would rather have back in the side.</p>
      <p>Here is a selection of what they had to say.</p>
      <p><b>Simon P Smith:</b> “Alan Hinton was the best English winger of his generation, and maybe one of the best all time. No contest.”</p>
      <p><b>Chris Leedham:</b> “Tin man. But also thought Simmo was a great player for us and he scored more goals.”</p>
      <p><b>Marc Whiley:</b> “Tin Man, seen them all and he wins it hands down.”</p>
