                <p>However, the side know that they can’t afford to repeat the same horrendous mistakes as their last outing if they are to continue in their marauding ways. The side were sent packing for a sorry 60 runs the last time around as they stepped out in pursuit of 108, a calamitous 47 run defeat which the team will be looking to paper over come their tie against Deccan Gladiators today.</p>
                <p>Deccan Gladiators on the other hand ended up sweeping past Karnataka Tuskers yesterday by 5 wickets as the side imbedded in place a pinch perfect run chase to chase down the 111 target laid out infront of them with 9 balls to spare. It saw them make it two wins out of three matches to not only canter their way into the Super League stage but with it also sit atop of Group A, a befitting position given the meticulous brand of cricket they have doled out till now.</p>

                            <h3>DEG vs QAL Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Qalandars’ Luke Ronchi will be our choice in this docket of our side with the side’s wicket-keeper putting in some steady dsplays till now in the opening slot to lay down a platform for the rest of his counterparts to take off from.</p>
                            <h3>DEG vs QAL Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>His partner Tom Banton has provided him exquisite assistance at the other end with the two openers acting as the talisman of their side’s batting order at the top of the order. Philip Salt comes in as well to partner the duo alongside Dawid Malan with the unit’s captain opening his arms and regaling us in a wondrous display of clean hitting the last time around to tally up 32 runs.</p>
                            <p>From the other side meanwhile we are choosing Shane Watson for this docket of our Dream 11 side with the side’s captain being their highest run getter till now.</p>
                            <h3>DEG vs QAL Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Deccan Gladiators will be represented by Anton Devcich in this slot of our Dream 11 side given the number 3 batting slot the player comes out to bat in. It’s a position he’s done full justice to as well with the player coming out with some expansive knocks to keep the run rate flowing freely for the side.</p>
                            <p>From the other side we have gone in with the one player as well with Seekkuge Prasanna being our pick for the day. Where the player has scored some important cameos in the lower middle-order till now, his legspin saw him pick up the one wicket as well the last time around, a gripping narrative which could see him earn an elevated spot in the side’s bowling soiree come today.</p>
                            <h3>DEG vs QAL Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>At a time when Qalandars have been unsure of what their best bowling unit is, shuffling around the seven bowlers to send down 10 overs the last time around, Lahiru Kumara has dug his feet in deep for the side. The player has kept waging a lone battle to thwart opposition bats from piling on the runs with his two wickets the last time around seeing him become the team’s leading wicket taker.</p>
                            <p>From the other side meanwhile we are picking out Migael Pretorius who comes into the clash in pristine and sublime form. The payer has dwelled deep into his skill set to pick up wickets at crucial junctures for the side, more importantly standing tall amongst his counterparts owing to the restrictive brand of bowling he’s doled out. Zahir Khan comes in as well from the unit to give him company for the day.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Dawid will represent us as captain while Watson is being chosen as the vice-captain.</p>
