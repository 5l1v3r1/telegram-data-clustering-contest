      <p>A Giltbrook mum who set up a bridal make up business from her parents' spare room and worked for free has gone on to win a national award.</p>
      <p>Bonnie Beck used to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/jobs/">work </a>for a distribution firm where she was an account manager for 10 years before she decided to go into something where she could decide her hours after giving birth to her son, Roman, five.</p>
      <p>"It was a job I was very good at over the years, so I did brave it all by doing something so different. It was definitely scary at the time," the 33-year-old said.</p>
      <p>"I've always had a passion for beauty and making women feel good about themselves and wanted to go with it."</p>

      <p>Now a beauty salon owner in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/ilkeston">Ilkeston</a>, the mum started out with nothing other than training in styling brows, eyelashes and makeup for brides-to-be on their big day.</p>
      <p>She would travel up and down the country trying to make a name for herself and said she would often work with clients for free in a hope to encourage good word of mouth.</p>

      <p>As part of her service she would provide brides with an 'SOS kit' for their wedding including lipstick, a mirror and perfume as "a little added touch".</p>
      <p>In September, the businesswoman opened up her own salon, Bonnie's Beauty Temple, in Awsworth Road, and "hasn't looked back since".</p>
      <p>And then on Sunday, October 27, Miss Beck scooped the award for Best Bridal Makeup award at the National Hair and Beauty Awards in Leicester after being nominated by clients.</p>

      <p>"I did a lot of work for free to build up that client base and get my name out there," she added.</p>
      <p>"I worked out of my parents' spare room for a while and travelled up and down the country going to appointments.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to work around <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/family-kids/">my son</a> and create something for him. I want to get bigger and better with another salon."</p>

      <p>Speaking about her award and what makes her different, Bonnie added: "I was so shocked to win the award. I would never have imagined it.</p>
      <p>"My key aim is to treat everyone as my friend and part of the family. I'd do anything I could for my clients.</p>
      <p>"I just want to provide those little added touches to clients - something they'll remember you by.</p>
      <p>"I pride myself on customer service and building relationships with my clients. I've created a professional, yet personal setting for people to relax in."</p>
