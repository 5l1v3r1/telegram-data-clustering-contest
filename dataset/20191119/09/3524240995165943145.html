      <p>Three members of the Iranian security forces have been stabbed to death by “rioters” near Tehran, the ISNA and Fars news agencies reported late Monday.</p>
      <p>The assailants wielding knives and machetes ambushed the three — a Revolutionary Guard and two members of the Basij militia — west of the capital, the news agencies reported.</p>
      <p>The deaths take to at least five the number of people confirmed to have been killed in violent demonstrations that erupted across Iran on Friday against a surprise petrol price hike.</p>
      <p>One of the three was identified as Morteza Ebrahimi, a commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and father of a newborn child, according to Fars.</p>
      <p>The other two were Majid Sheikhi, 22, and Mostafa Rezaie, 33. Both served in the Basij militia, a volunteer force loyal to the establishment.</p>
      <p>State television said a ceremony would be held for Ebrahimi and Rezaie in Tehran on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
