      <p>The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has uncovered how a jailed fraudster coordinated scam operations while he is in prison.</p>
      <p>The fraudster, Hope Olusegun Aroke, a convicted internet scammer, is serving a 24-year jail term.</p>
      <p>The EFCC said Aroke recently masterminded an internet scam worth $100 million from prison.</p>
      <p>“Investigation revealed that he masterminded the commission of internet scam worth over $100, 000, 000 whilst serving his jail term,” the EFCC said.</p>
      <p>Arole was one of two Malaysia-based Nigerian undergraduate fraudsters arrested by the EFCC in the closing weeks of 2012 at the 1004 Housing Estate, Victoria Island, Lagos following a scoop.</p>
      <p>The indigene of Okene, Kogi State had claimed to be a student of Computer Science at the Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan University, Malaysia.</p>
      <p>But EFCC’s investigation fingered him as the arrowhead of an intricate web of internet fraud scheme that traverses two continents.</p>
      <p>When Aroke was arrested, a search conducted by EFCC operatives on his apartment led to the recovery of several items such as laptops, iPad, traveling documents, cheque books, flash drives, internet modem, and three exotic cars – a Mercedes Benz Jeep, One 4Matic Mercedes Benz Car and a Range Rover Sport SUV.</p>
