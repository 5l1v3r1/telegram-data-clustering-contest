      <p>
        <b>Here’s what you should know if you’re thinking about auditioning for the show:</b>
      </p>
      <p>- <b>Auditions</b> usually take place early each year – and the <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/TV/Idols/idols-sa-season-15-winner-crowned-20191117"><b>dates for 2020</b></a> have been set. Auditions will be kicking off in <b>Cape Town on 1 February</b> before heading to <b>Pretoria on 15 February</b>, <b>Durban on 22 February </b>and <b>Johannesburg on 7 March</b>. Be sure to keep your eyes peeled on the Idols SA social media pages or on <a href="https://mzansimagic.dstv.com/show/idols-sa-season14/news/idols-sa-season-15-audition-dates/news">Mzansi Magic’s site</a> for when they announce the official audition venues</p>
      <p>- There’s <b>no pre-registration</b> – registration takes place at the venue – so it’s best to <b>arrive early </b>to avoid missing your shot</p>
      <p>- <b>Telkom hosts </b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/IdolsSA/videos/vb.152311134789008/1549747441794672/?type=2&amp;theater"><b>pop-up auditions</b></a>, so, if you find you’re unable to make it to one of the official venues or live too far out from the 4 venue cities, you can still shoot your shot at one of the Telkom pop-up auditions stands.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>What are some of the dos and don’ts for your audition?</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/TV/News/7-things-not-to-do-when-you-audition-for-Idols-SA-this-weekend-20150129">Channel24</a> previously shared some tips on how to help refine your audition prep and have you ready to go to wow the judges.</p>
      <p>- Don’t forget the lyrics of your chosen song</p>
      <p>- A cover is a safe bet – try to keep your original songs for later in the show</p>
      <p>- Keep it simple – try not to over-sing and focus on keeping your voice consistent and within your comfortable range</p>
      <p>- Don’t flirt with the judges – be open and friendly, but it’s important to respect their boundaries the same as you would any other person</p>
      <p>- Avoid playing an instrument if you’re prone to nerves or aren’t too confident in playing it </p>
      <p>
        <b>Some additional tips to remember:</b>
      </p>
      <p>- Remember to breathe – breath control is not only vital to help with your vocal stability, but can also help soothe rattled nerves ahead of your song</p>
      <p>- Song choice is important, there’s a reason Idol legend Simon Cowell <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8464910/simon-cowell-americas-got-talent-audition-hunter-price">emphasises this</a> to contestants. Choosing the right song will majorly impact how your voice is received. Knowing your voice and its strengths as well as weaknesses will help you in knowing which genre will fit it best. Ask those around you for constructive feedback on your song choice ahead of time. </p>
      <p>Now that you know what you could win and how to effectively prep for your chance at stardom – it's time to get to work and get those vocals primed for audition season coming soon in 2020. </p>
