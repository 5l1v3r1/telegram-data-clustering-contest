      <h1>FCC Chairman Wants Public Auction To Repurpose Satellite Bands For 5G</h1>

      <p>Chairman Ajit Pai is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/18/fcc-chairman-c-band-auction-for-5g/">pressing for a public auction of wireless frequencies in the C-band spectrum</a> (the 4GHz to 8GHz range often used by satellite companies) for the sake of 5G service. Engadget reports: <i>This would help the FCC clear up "significant" frequency space in a quick fashion, generate money for the government and "ensure continued delivery" of existing services, Pai argued. He hoped to auction off a 280MHz slice while leaving the upper 200MHz available. An FCC official <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fcc-backs-public-auction-of-5g-airwaves-11574102514">told the Wall Street Journal</a> that the regulator hoped to bring the C-band auction up for a vote in 2020 and start the auction by the end of that year. <br/><br/>Satellite companies, however, might not be so happy. Industry giants like Intelsat and SES haven't been averse to selling their spectrum, but they've wanted a private auction to share the money they make and have claimed the FCC isn't allowed to take in-use spectrum without paying them. A public auction flies in the face of that. The C-Band Alliance, a group representing the satellite firms, has hinted at "protracted litigation" if the FCC pushes forward. Carriers are also of mixed opinions. AT&amp;T, which owns DirecTV, has called C-band an "opportunity" but also wanted compensation and a "reasonable transition plan" to avoid disruptions. Verizon (Engadget's parent company and Pai's former employer) likewise wanted "appropriate incentives and protections" to ensure a quick process.</i></p>
