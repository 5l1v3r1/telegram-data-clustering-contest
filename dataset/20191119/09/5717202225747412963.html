      </p>
      <p>A Spurs insider has <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7699319/Time-running-Mauricio-Pochettino-just-matter-leaves-Tottenham.html">reportedly told the Mail</a> that Pochettino seeing out the season at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium looks impossible. And Ancelotti – along with Eddie Howe and Julian Nagelsmann – is one potential target.</p>

      <p>Ancelotti is not a stranger to the Premier League, having led Chelsea to a league and cup double in 2010. And it appears that if he had it his way, he would already be managing in North London by now.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.calcionapoli24.it/calcio_mercato/venerato-wenger-indic-ancelotti-come-suo-successore-l-arsenal-lo-scart-poi-la-n395147.html">According to a report from Calcio Napoli 24 earlier this year</a>, Ancelotti was keen to take the Arsenal job when Arsene Wenger stepped down in 2018.</p>

      <p>Wenger himself, reportedly suggested to the Gunners hierarchy that they should appoint the Italian. But, of course, Unai Emery would ultimately get the job.</p>
      <p>It may not be a huge surprise if plenty of Arsenal fans wish that the club had gone for Ancelotti. Emery is coming under increasing pressure from the supporters.</p>
      <p>Ancelotti is also facing criticism at Napoli. The Azzurri sit seventh in Serie A, five points off the top four and 13 points behind Juventus.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Arsenal fans would be forgiven for wondering what Ancelotti could have done with the squad Emery has.</p>
      <p>Reports would suggest that Ancelotti could now be on the way back to England. Unfortunately for the Arsenal fans who wish he had got the job instead of Emery, it now appears that it may actually be Tottenham who attempt to lure him back to the Premier League.</p>
