      <h1>Transfer Rumour: Manchester United keeping tabs on Matheus Pereira</h1>

      <h3>Manchester United are reportedly interested in Sporting Lisbon youngster Matheus Pereira, who is currently plying his trade for West Bromwich Albion on loan.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-eyeing-matheus-pereira-20897155">The Mirror</a> claim that Manchester United are interested in a young Brazilian star. Matheus Pereira, who is currently on loan in England playing for West Brom in the Championship, has caught the eye of Manchester United. The Red Devils are contemplating making a move for the Sporting Lisbon star.</p>
      <p>Matheus Pereira has been a journeyman so far, with Sporting CP loaning him out to different leagues and different clubs over the last three seasons. The 2018-19 season was a good learning curve for Matheus at Nurnberg, who were relegated at the end of the season.</p>

      <p>The experience has helped him adapt to English football well and set Championship ablaze with his skills. Brought in on a loan deal with an obligation to buy by West Brom, the Baggies themselves would not have envisioned such a level of performance from the 23-year-old.</p>
      <p>In 14 league appearances, Matheus Pereira has scored thrice and set up his teammates 9 nine times, with his form garnering a lot of eyeballs. West Brom have a buy clause of £8.25 million, but that will not deter suitors like Manchester United.</p>

      <p>One of the major reasons behind United’s interest in Pereira could be his position on the field. The 23-year-old is predominantly a right winger, a position that United oh so desperately are in need of reinforcing with natural options. To add to it, Matheus has the ability to play all across the front four, which is the kind of interchangeability Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants in his attack.</p>
      <p>The reports have claimed Manchester United are looking to launch a double swoop worth £200 million for Erling Haaland and Jadon Sancho. But, there will be other suitors for the duo and United could be upstaged by others. Also, the cost mentioned is exorbitant, especially after United spent a lot to bring in Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka over the summer.</p>

      <p>Matheus Pereira could be a brilliant budget option for Manchester United. The 23-year-old is explosive, has an eye for a pass and seems to be hitting his stride right now. United could bring the Brazilian in a-la Daniel James, who had a similarly good season in the Championship before being signed by Manchester United.</p>
      <p>James is now a regular and one of the key players under Solskjaer and Matheus could follow the Welshman’s route to Old Trafford. While Solskjaer and his scouts are impressed with Matheus so far, it would be only logical to see if the run of form signifies just that or an elevation of his level and a hint that he is ready for the big stage.</p>
