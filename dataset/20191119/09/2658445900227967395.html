      <p>Speaking on the idea behind the album’s title, the Headies-nominated singer had said that his choice of ‘Ycee vs Zaheer’ was a deliberate attempt to display his singing (Ycee) and rapping (Zaheer) side.</p>
      <p>YCee rose to limelight after his single ‘Condo’, which features vocals from Patoranking, earned him two nominations at the 2015 Nigeria Entertainment Awards.</p>
      <p>He was also nominated for Best Artist in African Pop at the 2015 All Africa Music Awards.</p>
      <p>In October 2016, Ycee signed a record deal with Sony Music, but terminated his contract with the label in February 2018.</p>
