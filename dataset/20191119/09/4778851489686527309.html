      <p>Arzani joined in the summer of 2018 for a two-year loan deal, but has played just once due to the setback.</p>
      <p>Manager Neil Lennon has yet to see the player in first-team action, though The World Game are claiming the Parkhead boss has been impressed enough with the player in training to open a dialogue with City about extending his stay.</p>
      <p>Arzani isn't expected to return to action until Boxing Day at the earliest having suffered patella tendonitis as he looks to complete his long-term recovery.</p>
