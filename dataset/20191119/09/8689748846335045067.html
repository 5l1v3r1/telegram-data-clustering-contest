      <p>One social media user identified as Favour B has released a video of the moment a tipsy Davido and his crew were prevented from absconding a hotel in Dubai.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, it was reported that Nigerian singer, Davido was arrested after stabbing one Michael aka Dream Chaser, who is the younger brother of Abu Abel, the CEO of Obimzy Records in Dubai.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the unfortunate incident happened inside an elevator at Crab Market, Emirates Financial Towers, Dubai after the victim reportedly approached the intoxicated singer and his entourage to take a selfie.</p>
      <p>A few seconds later, blood was gushing from his body, and the assailant was identified as Davido by multiple sources.</p>
      <p>In the video shared by Favour B, Davido and his crew members allegedly attempted to flee the scene of the incident, but bouncers stopped them from escaping.</p>
      <p>Davido and his team are yet to react to the allegations levelled against him.</p>
