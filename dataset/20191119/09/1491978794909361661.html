      <h1>Moscow court rejects appeal of US man held on espionage charges</h1>

        <i>Paul Whelan, who has been held for 11 months, has called his case a ‘hostage situation’</i>
      </p>
      <p>A Moscow court has upheld the arrest of Paul Whelan, an American citizen being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/03/moscow-spy-charges-ex-marine-arrested-after-usb-drive-pickup-paul-whelan">held in Russia on espionage charges</a> who has called his case a “hostage situation”.</p>
      <p>The court rejected Whelan’s appeal to be released from Russia’s notorious Lefortovo prison, where he has been held for more than 11 months, in a hearing closed to the press because his case is classified.</p>
      <p>Whelan has lost weight and complained of abuse in the prison, according to monitors who have visited him.</p>
      <p>He appeared by video link on Tuesday, filmed in a defendant’s cage in Lefortovo prison with the sound off. In a previous courtroom appearance, Whelan had delivered an impassioned speech to the members of the press allowed to hear the court’s decision, saying: “Russia thought they caught James Bond on a spy mission. In reality they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/24/paul-whelan-ex-us-marine-detained-russia-spy-charges">abducted Mr Bean on holiday</a>.” He ignored orders from a judge to remain quiet.</p>
      <p>Russia has accused Whelan of collecting information about members of Russia’s intelligence services, and says it arrested him in December with a USB stick containing classified information. Whelan has said he was framed and has been travelling to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> for years because he has friends here.</p>
      <p>“The resolution of the Moscow Lefortovsky district court is upheld, and the appeal is dismissed,” the court said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Whelan’s arrest has raised speculation that he could be traded for a number of Russians held in US prisons, though it is not yet clear for whom. His lawyer has said discussion of a swap would probably not take place until after a trial, a process that he expected to begin next year.</p>
      <p>Family members <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/18/russia-accused-of-hostage-diplomacy-over-jailed-foreigners">have accused Russia of engaging in hostage diplomacy</a>, comparing Whelan’s arrest to practices in countries such as China and Iran. Whelan’s brother said he believed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> was drawing out his case to “see what they can get from the United States for him”.</p>
      <p>In an interview, Whelan’s lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, said he believed Russia would be willing to consider a trade for his client.</p>
      <p>“If Trump releases one of ours then I’m sure that ours will release someone too,” he said. “It’s high politics. I want to say that our president is absolutely sane about this. Putin sees this all rather calmly. Why not [make a trade]?”</p>
