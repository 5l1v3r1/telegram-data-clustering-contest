      <h1>Gabriel Jesus has discussed Mo Salah’s ‘quality’ while away with Brazil</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:57:17+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Gabriel Jesus has spoken nicely about Liverpool’s superstar Mo Salah while away on international with Brazil.</p>
      <p><i>El Selecao</i> play South Korea in Abu Dhabi today for a meaningless friendly that has required nearly all its players to travel thousands of miles in order to compete.</p>
      <p>Alisson, Fabinho and Roberto Firmino could all feature, with Manchester City ace Jesus also likely to play from the outset.</p>
      <p>His words in the prelude though have been about our no.11 and not Bobby, his Brazil team-mate.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Salah has showed his quality in the last two seasons, he has scored a lot. I don’t train with him, but I know he is quality,” he told the <a href="https://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/gabriel-jesus-q-a-brazil-striker-on-man-city-mohamed-salah-and-facing-south-korea-in-abu-dhabi-1.939456">National</a>, a UAE publication.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Egyptian has somehow been the subject of some criticism this season, despite his numbers being as brilliant as ever.</p>
      <p>His registered nine goals and five assists in 15 matches for Liverpool in 2019/20, which is basically one goal contribution every game played…</p>
      <p>Salah’s standards are so mindbogglingly high, that fans think this can somehow be improved upon – bearing in mind he’s not a striker – but a right winger!</p>
      <p>We just hope Salah is fit for the Crystal Palace tie on Saturday… The attacker is currently trying to get his fitness back following a recurrence of an ankle issue picked up in our 3-1 win over Manchester City last time out.</p>
