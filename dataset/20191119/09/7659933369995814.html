      <p>Sudan’s transitional Sovereignty Council called on the national committee for border demarcation to define all regional borders for the African state. Meanwhile, a resolution for inner state borders was deferred due dispute over some areas.<br/><br/>Official spokesperson Mohammad Al-Faki Suleiman said that the Council had vowed to provide support needed by the commission to carry out its duties. <br/><br/>He pointed out that demarcating internal borders in the war-torn country is still tied to ongoing peace processes and talks held with armed factions. The distribution of national wealth among provinces remains a debate in discussion.<br/><br/>Faki said the council had stressed the need to control and regulate all maps showing the country’s borders and for the commission to issue an Atlas confirming were borders are set.<br/>Most of Sudan's border with neighboring countries (Ethiopia, Libya, Central Africa, and Egypt), amounting to about 6,834 kilometers, remained undefined, except for Sudan's border with Chad, which was demarcated.<br/><br/>Sudan is in conflict with Egypt over the Halaib triangle in the far northeast, with Ethiopia over the Faqsha area, and with South Sudan over the Abyei area.<br/><br/>More so, Sudan and South Sudan are in dispute over five border areas that haven’t been demarcated since in 2011.<br/><br/>In October, the two countries signed an agreement on the matter.</p>
