      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Kilmarnock</a> police have issued a warning to drivers after a car was stolen while defrosting.</p>
      <p>The motor was pinched from the Onthank area yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>Now officers are reminding vehicle owners to be vigilant.</p>
      <p>East Ayrshire Safer Communities Officer PC Marshall said: “This time of year and the frosty weather gives rise to this type of opportunistic theft.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Vehicle owners are asked to take time to defrost their vehicle but stay with it whilst the engine is running.</p>
      <p>"By leaving your vehicle unattended you are giving thieves an opportunity.</p>
      <p>“Please follow the reminder below or for more information visit the ‘Keep Safe’ pages of our website.”</p>
