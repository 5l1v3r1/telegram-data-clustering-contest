      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kanye-west/">Kanye West</a> has ‘splashed out $14.4million (£11.1m) on another ranch in Wyoming’ – despite wife <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> ‘not being all that keen’ on moving down there.</p>
      <p>Just months after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/06/kanye-west-takes-one-step-closer-living-dream-buys-14million-wyoming-ranch-10700209/">shelling out $14million (£10.8m) on a huge property in the area</a>, the Jesus Is King rapper is back at it again, and has reportedly dropped serious cash on another place.</p>
      <p>Well, if you’ve got the money…</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/18/kanye-west-buys-14-million-wyoming-ranch-bighorn-mountain/">According to TMZ</a>, the 42-year-old rapper has treated himself to Bighorn Mountain Ranch, which spans 6,713 acres, and comes complete with several log cabins and two heated helipads.</p>
      <p>Because one heated helipad just won’t do?</p>
      <p>Not only that, there are lodges dotted around and walk-in saunas, with the ranch surrounded by rolling hills, and deer, antelope and turkey casually roaming the grounds.</p>
      <p>That’s going to be a housewarming party with a difference.</p>

      <p>However, it has been claimed that Kim, 39, isn’t really that into the ‘simple housing’ that comes with the ranch, and won’t be making a permanent move from LA to Wyoming just yet.</p>

      <p>‘Kim is definitely not moving and living full-time in Wyoming right now. Kim likes visiting Wyoming, but she sees it more like a vacation place,’ an insider claimed. ‘It’s very quiet and private.</p>

      <p>‘Every time they go, they enjoy it. But they are usually comfortable in luxury housing. The ranch only has simple housing. It’s mostly cabins with no amenities at all.</p>
      <p>‘Kim just isn’t a fan of the cabins. There are many things that need to happen before she and the kids can spend more time there. Kim has a whole list of things. They would need to build a house so everyone can be comfortable.</p>

      <p>‘And now, when everyone knows Kanye bought the ranch, there needs to be an elaborate security system put in.’</p>
      <p>So Ye’s just dropped $14million for a holiday home?</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/03/kim-kardashians-dream-move-wyoming-live-ranch-10680494/">Kim hasn’t ruled out the idea of leaving LA for good</a>, explaining that she could see herself and their brood – children North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm – in Wyoming in the next decade.</p>
      <p>During a chat with the Gold Digger rapper, he asked where she wants to be in the next 10 years.</p>

      <p>‘In my mind I’m already living in those 10 years. I see us living on a ranch in Wyoming, occasionally going to Palm Springs and our home in Los Angeles – and becoming a lawyer,’ she replied.</p>
      <p>The Kardashian-West’s Take Wyoming, anyone?</p>
