      <p>When Esme, a young Nigerian girl, is found dead at a bus stop, Inspector Jen Rooney (Lynn Rafferty of Ripper Street) and her team of detectives investigate a nearby center for asylum-seekers. The shaken residents there are afraid to speak to the police, and the disorganized manager (Brian Gleeson, Logan Lucky) provides no help. Jen and her team have little to go on until CCTV footage reveals that one resident, refugee Abeni Bankole (Aïssa Maïga, Paris, je t’aime), may know more about Esme than she let on. Orla Fitzgerald (The Wind that Shakes the Barley), and Slimane Dazi (Only Lovers Left Alive) also star in this thrilling drama.  </p>
