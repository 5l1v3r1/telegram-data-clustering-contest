      <p>The tides have turned for <a href="https://guardian.ng/tag/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a> and her swifties as the drama between the American singer-songwriter and her erstwhile music label Big Machine Label Group has abated.</p>
      <p>The label owned by Scooter Braun and Carlyle Group and overseen by Scott Borchetta has reversed the alleged <a href="https://guardian.ng/life/taylor-swift-cries-for-help-following-ban-from-perfoming-her-old-songs/">decision to stop Swift from performing her own songs. </a></p>
      <p>The label released a statement:</p>
      <blockquote>“The Big Machine Label Group and Dick Clark Productions announce that they have come to terms on a licensing agreement that approves their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms. This includes the upcoming American Music Awards performances. It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media. Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists’ audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed.”</blockquote>
      <p>Shortly after the above statement, Dick Clark Productions also clarified their stance on the matter:</p>
      <blockquote>“At no time did Dick Clark Productions agree to, create, authorize or distribute a statement in partnership with Big Machine Label Group regarding Taylor Swift’s performance at the 2019 American Music Awards. Any final agreement on this matter needs to be made directly with Taylor Swift’s management team. We have no further comment.”</blockquote>
      <p>Swift had in a Twitter essay has alleged that music manager Scooter Braun and Big Machine Label Group’s founder Scott Borchetta have<a href="https://guardian.ng/life/taylor-swift-cries-for-help-following-ban-from-perfoming-her-old-songs/"> banned her from performing a medley of her old hits</a>.</p>
      <p>The singer is set to be honoured with the Artist of the Decade at the 2019 American Music Awards (AMA) where she intends to treat the audience to a collection of her old songs.</p>
      <p>Swift had been signed to Big Machine from her 2006 self-titled debut album through 2017’s “Reputation,” before moving to Universal Music Group.</p>
