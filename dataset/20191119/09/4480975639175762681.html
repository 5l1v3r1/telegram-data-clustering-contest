      <p>The USD/CAD pair was seen oscillating in a narrow trading band through the early European session on Tuesday, with bears awaiting a sustained break below the 1.3200 handle.<br/> <br/>The pair lacked any firm directional bias on Tuesday and consolidated the recent sharp pullback from one-month tops. A combination of diverging forces failed to provide any meaningful impetus and lead to a subdued/range-bound price action.</p>
