      <h1>United States SEC to Review Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Application</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:22:41+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:22</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel McIntosh</a></address>
      <p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing its decision to reject the application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that was submitted by Bitwise Asset Management and NYSE Arca earlier this year. The announcement came in an<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/11/18/2019-24874/self-regulatory-organizations-nyse-arca-inc-order-scheduling-filing-of-statements-on-review-for-an"> official notice</a> dated November 18th, 2019.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Bitwise’s head of research, Matt Hougan, said to <i>CoinDesk</i> that the company was not seeking to overturn the SEC’s decision, though it “welcome[s] the opportunity to submit comments and continue the dialogue with the SEC.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Bitwise’s application was <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/sec-rejects-bitwises-bitcoin-etf-proposal/">originally denied on October 9th of this year.</a> While it’s not entirely clear what caused the SEC to bring the application back to review, SEC commissioners have the ability to review decisions following the filing of a petition, or at their own discretion.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>CoinDesk reported that unlike the formal process of approval and disapproval on an ETF application, there are no fixed deadlines for the review of a decision. Previously, the SEC<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/sec-orders-review-winklevoss-bitcoin-etf-rejection"> reviewed the rejection</a> of the Bitcoin ETF application submitted by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, founders of the Gemini exchange; after more than a year passed, the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/sec-rejects-winklevoss-bitcoin-etf-plans/">rejection was ultimately upheld.</a></p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Bitwise called the rejection “a productive step in the journey toward a regulated crypto ETP”</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>At the time that Bitwise’ ETF was rejected, the company tweeted that “though ‘disapprove’ doesn’t seem positive, this is a productive step in the journey toward a regulated crypto ETP.”</p>

      <p>The company also said at the time that “in short, the issue is a known one: concerns about market manipulation &amp; oversight. We’re optimistic about this &amp; how the market has matured on this front in just the past 2 [years]. But there’s more to be done,” and that “Historically, the journey to approval for first-of-a-kind ETPs —bonds, gold, non-transparent, leverage— has taken multiple [years].”</p>

      <p>The review of the Bitwise application could result in a similar outcome. Indeed, a number of experts have speculated that years may pass before the SEC would consider approving an ETF application.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In September, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/19/cnbc-exclusive-cnbcs-andrew-ross-sorkin-interviews-united-states-securities-and-exchange-commission-chairman-jay-clayton-from-cnbc-institutional-investor-delivering-alpha-conference.html">said to CNBC</a> that “we have to get to a place, in my view — just speaking for myself — we have to get to a place that we can be confident that trading is better regulated” before a Bitcoin ETF would be allowed.</p>
