      <p>A Mutare prophet is in the eye of the storm after his alleged affair with his right-hand man’s girlfriend was exposed, forcing him to relocate to Harare. Prophet Brighton Gweru of Family Faith Church who has recently hogged the limelight for his<a href="https://www.hmetro.co.zw/street-pastor-on-mission/"> street sermons in Harare’s CBD</a> is allegedly trying to salvage his preaching career since his church is on the verge of collapse following the nasty adultery revelations.</p>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.hmetro.co.zw/prophet-snatches-aides-lover/">H-Metro</a>,  Prophet Gweru is alleged to have had a year-long affair with his aide’s girlfriend, Marvellous Tariro Mupungu. The cleric’s aide, Tapiwa Mwapaura, has since left the church following the discovery. There are also illicit audio messages between him and Marvellous</p>
      <p>Speaking to the publication, Mwapura said that he was deeply scarred by the betrayal.</p>
      <aside>I joined the church four years ago, and have been serving the man of God faithfully not knowing that he was dating my girlfriend.<br/>Prophet is married, but he was seeing my girlfriend behind my back for almost a year. I have been with her for over a year now.<br/>It affected my faith, and I feel betrayed by the person who pretended to help and map my future when he was planning to destroy it.<br/>Since 2014, we would experience full houses as people attended the church whole heartedly, but later we lost many souls after the scandal.<br/>I confronted the prophet over this. He apologised and deleted some of the WhatsApp messages. He did not know that I had saved the messages.</aside>
      <p>. Marvellous confirmed the story, saying she had since resolved the issue with Mwapaura.</p>
      <aside>I left Prophet Gweru some months ago, and I do not know what is happening at his church, I have since resolved the issue with Mwapaura. That is now water under the bridge.</aside>
      <p>Contacted for comment, Prophet Gweru said he was not aware of any of his acquaintances by the name of Tapiwa.</p>
      <aside>I will get back to you after church. Ndiri paCopacabana ndava kuda kutopinza church izvezvi. Tapiwa waunotaura ndamukanganwa ini, He told you falsehoods, and I do not even remember that Tapiwa. I am in Harare.</aside>
