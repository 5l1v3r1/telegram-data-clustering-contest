      <p>E.T. star Henry Thomas won’t be jailed after being stopped for driving under the influence.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/23/e-t-child-star-henry-thomas-arrested-allegedly-driving-influence-10967197/">The 48-year-old was arrested on 21 October in Oregon</a>, allegedly passed out behind the wheel of his care and stopped in the middle of a residential intersection.</p>
      <p>However, the former child star won’t face jail time after accepting a plea deal.</p>
      <p>Thomas pleaded no contest to driving under the influence and reckless driving.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/19/elliott-et-pled-no-contest-oregon-dui-case-henry-thomas/">According to TMZ</a>, the actor – also known for his role in The Haunting of Hill House – will pay a $500 (£385) fine and will enter a diversion program, a type of rehabilitation which aims to allow the offender to avoid conviction and remedy their behaviour.</p>
