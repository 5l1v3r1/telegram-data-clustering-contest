      <p>You would think that after the Samsung Galaxy Note fire fiasco a few years back that companies would be shy to push the boundaries of charging technology. Not so with companies such as OPPO, OnePlus and Xiaomi introducing faster and faster charging technology seemingly every couple of months.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi have today socialised an image announcing their new “Super Charge Turbo” technology that, according to the image, can charge a 4,000mAh battery in only 17 minutes. The new technology surpasses the speed of OPPO’s 65W charging power with a big jump to 100W speed.</p>

      <p>It is expected that this new technology will have many safeguard mechanisms to prevent the battery from heating up as we know the OPPO and OnePlus phones do. With 100W charging it <i>should</i> be able to charge anything you can get your hands on such as a laptop (and a small electric car nearly?).</p>
      <p>Xiaomi have been working on this technology for a while now with them first displaying it at the start of this year. Is seems that it now ready to be put into production. The new technology is expected to arrive in Xiaomi phones in the new year.</p>
      <p>It boggles the mind being able to charge your battery that fast. Give me a battery that can last 24 hours and you could just charge it while in the shower or having breakfast each morning.</p>
      <p>It will be interesting to see if OPPO up their game now although with 65W charging already you wonder whether the increase to 100W is actually required. Time will tell but I dare say other companies will copy and it will become a standard in a year or two’s time.</p>
