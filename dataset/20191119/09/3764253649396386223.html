      <p>Taking on the topic of forgiveness, Asemota disclosed that he has made it a way of life to always forgive those that wronged him. He added that just like forgiving people, he also learnt to put away his pride and ask for forgiveness.</p>
      <p><i>"I also learned to ask for forgiveness too. I learned to remove pride. Before I met my wife, I had to go celibate for almost 2 years and apologized to every girl I had wronged. I asked them for forgiveness. I decided never to lie after that or cheat on women. My life changed,"</i> his post read.</p>
