      <h1>Is it OK to smack your child? Australians are divided, but the practice is dying out</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:15:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/patrick-wood/7640496" target="_blank">Patrick Wood</a></address>
      <p>Ray* had a very strict dad.</p>
      <p>He had survived World War II as a child and later served in the army himself, and the experience seemed to harden him.</p>
      <p>It also influenced other aspects of his life as well — like how he raised his kids.</p>
      <p>"Life under my father was like living in the army, pretty regimental," Ray said.</p>
      <blockquote>"If I did anything wrong, there was no counselling … I usually got a hiding."</blockquote>
      <p>One time when Ray was about six years old he was playing outside with his sister when it started raining. Rather than come indoors they splashed around in the water.</p>
      <p>Ray's mum scolded them and changed their clothes, but his dad was furious and gave them both a belting.</p>
      <p>"I'm 67 now and I still remember it," Ray said.</p>
      <p>He swore he'd never use physical punishment on his own kids — but he says his wife had other ideas.</p>

      <h3>'It was a point of tension'</h3>
      <p>Smacking children as a form of discipline remains a deeply divisive issue in this country.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-06/australia-talks-explained/11570332">Australia Talks National Survey</a>, 47 per cent of Australians believe it's acceptable, compared to 38 per cent who disagree.</p>
      <p>For people like Ray, this divide can cause strains in family relationships that can last generations.</p>
      <p>His strongly held view is that it's never acceptable, and whether you tap a child with two fingers or a strap, you're telling the child it's OK to be violent.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately my wife decided she thought smacking was OK," he said.</p>
      <p>"It was a point of tension. Quite a strong point.</p>
      <p>"We would often have heated discussions about whether the child should be smacked or not.</p>
      <blockquote>"Her view was, 'Well how will they learn if I don't smack them?'"</blockquote>
      <p>They eventually separated when their kids were still young, and when they stayed with Ray he would use other forms of discipline if they did something wrong — like taking away privileges.</p>
      <p>But Ray's daughter is now an adult with a child of her own, and he says much to his dismay she smacks her kids.</p>
      <p>"God knows why. She knew the reasons I didn't but that's her choice," he said.</p>
      <p>"As a grandparent, you just have to sit back and observe. You can't say too much."</p>
      <h3>Data shows smacking going out of favour</h3>
      <p>Australians are far from alone in using smacking as form of discipline.</p>
      <p>A 2014 report by UNICEF found that worldwide 80 per cent of children are smacked or otherwise physically punished by their parents.</p>
      <p>Smacking is also one of the most examined aspects of parenting, with hundreds of studies seeking to determine if there's a connection between physical punishment and the emotional and behavioural effect on kids.</p>
      <p>A <a href="http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuar2/files/201612/spanking_and_child_outcomes.pdf">meta-analysis of these studies</a> — completed in 2016 by the American Psychological Association — found "there is no evidence that spanking does any good for children and all evidence points to the risk of it doing harm".</p>

      <p>Still, it is <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-18/corporal-punishment-of-children-should-be-banned/11025096">legal for parents and guardians to physically punish children in Australia</a>, says Patrick Lenta, an associate Professor in the Law Faculty at University of Technology Sydney.</p>
      <p>"In some states there is a common law defence permitting parents [and sometimes teachers] lawfully to administer 'reasonable' corporal punishment, while in other states the defence is contained in legislation," he said.</p>
      <p>Yet the Australia Talks data also shows the practice is going out of favour, with those agreeing it is acceptable consistently dropping off as the age bracket rises.</p>
      <p>This comes as some comfort to Ray, whose anti-smacking stance makes him an outlier in his age bracket, and he suggests younger generations are "more informed or socially more relaxed, because my generation in life was fairly intense."</p>
      <p>Still, ABC readers have shared their own views on the issue and reveal there remains a broad range of deeply held opinions on the topic.</p>
      <p>"I got smacked as a child and when I looked back I deserved it. It didn't do me any harm," Kathy said.</p>
      <blockquote>"It's completely acceptable in the right circumstances. Only for punishment and never in anger," Ian said.</blockquote>
      <p>"Look around you and observe the precious snowflakes fluttering around our country today. There is a massive misguided sense of entitlement in today's little darlings," Gary said.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, others said it led to unintended consequences.</p>
      <p>"I was given the belt and it made me terrified to own up to anything. I became quite angry and resentful that someone could punish a child so harshly for doing what kids do," Sue said.</p>
      <p>"If anything, smacking points to parents' impatience and exasperation. So no, it's not an acceptable form of discipline," Akira said.</p>
