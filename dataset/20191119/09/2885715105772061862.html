      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:00:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>According to a press release from the makers of Bigil, the film has grossed Rs 142.75 crore after four weeks in theaters. It looks like the Vijay-starrer has surpassed Viswasam’s collection that touched Rs 140 crore in Tamil Nadu.</p>
      <p>Reports also suggest that “Bigil is the second Rs 200 crore grosser (domestic) of the year, and Vijay is the fourth actor to achieve this feat after <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rajinikanth/">Rajinikanth</a>, Prabhas and Yash.”</p>
      <p>A source close to the unit added Bigil has also emerged the highest-grossing Tamil film in Kerala, collecting Rs 19.65 crore in Kerala, leaving behind Vikram’s I.</p>
      <p>Directed by Atlee, Bigil, which hit screens last month, features Vijay in dual roles – as a gangster and an energetic football coach of a women’s team.</p>
      <p>Produced by AGS Entertainment on a staggering budget of Rs 180 crore, the film stars <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/nayanthara/">Nayanthara</a>, Jackie Shroff, Indhuja, Reba Monica John, Amritha Aiyer, Varsha, Kathir, Vivek and Yogi Babu in pivotal roles.</p>
      <p>The film was also released in Telugu as Whistle.</p>
