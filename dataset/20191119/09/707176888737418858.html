      <h1>Tata Steel plans to cut 3,000 jobs in Europe</h1>
      <h2>Steelmaker grapples with ‘unprecedented’ market conditions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:27:50+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:27</time> by <a rel="author">Nikou Asgari</a></address>
      <p>Tata Steel is planning to cut 3,000 jobs across its European operations as the company wrestles with “unprecedented” market conditions.</p>
      <p>About two-thirds of the job cuts will fall on office-based workers, the group said in a statement late on Monday.</p>
      <p>Like other European producers, Tata’s profits have been squeezed by higher raw material costs and a fall in steel prices, exacerbated by mounting imports of cheap metal. Orders from customers in key areas such as carmaking have been hit by a wider slowdown in manufacturing as the US-China trade war continues.</p>
      <p>British Steel, which was sold by Tata for £1 in 2016 and fell into administration in May, was bought last week by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c3ca4d06-05e6-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd">Chinese conglomerate Jingye</a> in a deal that will potentially save 4,000 jobs.</p>
      <p>European steelmakers have also been hit by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a3142e60-a321-11e9-a282-2df48f366f7d">surging carbon allowance prices</a> that they must buy to offset emissions.</p>
      <p>Trade unions were alarmed by Tata’s headline job loss figure and the fact that the company, which employs about 20,000 people at all its locations, provided no further details about when or where the cuts would be made.</p>
      <p>“This is a shocking announcement which will worry many steelworkers and their families in the UK and across Europe,” said Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the steelworkers’ trade union, Community, who added: “The company should hang its head in shame with the way this development has been communicated.”</p>
      <p>Henrik Adam, chief executive of Tata Steel Europe, said the plans would help create a “financially strong and sustainable European business” as the company attempted to become more profitable “in the face of unprecedented severe market conditions”.</p>
      <p>Tata made an overall loss before tax of £191m in the year to March 31 2019, according to Companies House accounts.</p>
      <p>It aims to achieve earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £750m for the 2020/2021 financial year by increasing the sale of higher-value steels and reducing procurement costs. This compares with ebitda of £576m in 2018-19.</p>
      <p>Mr Adam <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/91a74aa4-0933-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67">told the Financial Times</a> last week that Tata would aim to make employment cost savings of £150m but there would be no plant closures. “I strongly believe in a togetherness of Tata Steel in Europe . . . We are stronger together. Or, vice versa, weaker alone,” he said.</p>
      <p>The job cuts announcement is a fresh blow for workers at Tata’s plant in Port Talbot, Wales, who have endured years of uncertainty at the UK’s largest steelworks, which employs about 4,000 people.</p>
      <p>The announcement came after a merger with German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp was scrapped this year, a deal that both companies had hoped would lead to cost savings. Brussels wanted significant disposals to mitigate concerns and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5f0feae0-8c3f-11e9-a24d-b42f641eca37">blocked the landmark steel merger</a> in June on competition grounds.</p>
      <p>“This transformation programme is a direct result of Tata’s failure to deliver the joint venture with Thyssenkrupp and the complete absence of any plan B,” said the European Works Council in a statement. “We firmly believe that employees should not pay the price for Tata’s failures.”</p>
