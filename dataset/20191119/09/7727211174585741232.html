      <p>She told Lorraine Kelly: "There is a lot of controversy about this.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to do it, I was not asked to do it, there was a problem with dates at first, but I am gutted. But that is just the way it goes."</p>
      <p>There were also reports that her and Gio clashed, arguing backstage and that she had stormed off the BBC show on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Happy to answer questions, the Drag Race UK judge said: "They [the press] said I stormed out of actual Blackbpool - I was at the party till 3am dancing with Kelvin and Oti and Gio.</p>
      <p>"None of it's true. I am a party girl and I love people, I would stay to the end."</p>
      <p>Speaking about rumours that her and Gio had come to blows during rehearsals, she said she had prayed to get him as her professional partner: "We have such and incredible relationship and this thing has been so much richer because of him.</p>
      <p>"I rang him yesterday, and he is busy with the pro stuff but I said, 'any hours you have can we dance?'"</p>

      <p>After she was voted off the reality show, following her final performance to Madonna's 'Vogue', she told Tess Daily: "This whole experience has been amazing.</p>
      <p>"At 51 years old and never danced in my life, I never thought I'd be able to do what I have done and to have such an incredible partner.</p>
      <p>"To be here for my husband and my kids and the entire community, that's why I did what I did.</p>
      <p>"I am so honoured to be welcomed by my new friends here."</p>

      <p>Pernice admitted that the couple had been through a range of emotions during their time together, but said he has respect for his partner despite their arguments.</p>
      <p>He said: "We laugh, we cry, we fight and we argue and we've done everything but I've loved every single second. I think you are inspirational."</p>
      <p>Fans at home were devastated to see her go, many venting their frustration on Twitter, one @beckhughesxo said: "Can’t believe they saved Saffron over Michelle."</p>
      <p>Another, @WestCountrySuzi said: "Awwwww.....that's a real shame...thought she'd make it to the final."</p>
      <p>A third, @IshMotherBec said: "Another slightly shock exit. Although it's at the stage when almost any exit feels wrong."</p>
      <p>A fourth, @AaronLR1991 said: "I’m so annoyed!"</p>
      <p>And a fifth @evilcheltdevil added: "Gutted for @michellevisage and @pernicegiovann1 - just the worst result."</p>
