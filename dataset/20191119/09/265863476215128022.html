      <h1>T.I. And Wife Tiny Harris Will Address The Controversy Around Deyjah Harris’ Virginity On Jada Pinkett Smith’s Show — Will The Rapper Apologize For Humiliating His Daughter?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:33:27+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:33</time> by <a rel="author">Mel Walker</a></address>
      <p>Jada Pinkett Smith has announced that she will soon interview T.I. along with his wife and singer, Tiny Harris, who will, for the first time, address the rapper’s odd comments regarding his 18-year-daughter, Deyjah Harris’ virginity.</p>
      <p>Jada will have a conversation with the couple on her Facebook Watch series, <i>Red Table Talk</i>.</p>
      <p>Will Smith’s wife revealed: “My next big guest is Tip. T.I. is coming to the table. Yes indeed. And of course, he’s going to address the controversy that has been swirling.”</p>
      <p>She continued with: “We just shot that [episode of <i>Red Table Talk</i>] today. And then he and [his wife] Tiny sit down and talk about how they survived, in regards to their marriage. So that will be next Monday.”</p>
      <p>Rapper T.I. is under major backlash after he participated in an episode of the podcast, <i>Ladies Like Us</i> recently.</p>
      <p>During his guest appearance, he discussed his parenting style with the hostesses, Nazanin Mandi and Nadia Moham, and in particular, he talked about how he deals with his teenage daughter, Deyjah, growing up.</p>
      <p>The rapper shocked the world with his explanations, stating that he accompanied the 18-year-old to her gynecological check-ups every year and that he even made her undergo tests to show if her hymen is still intact. The famous rapper also proudly added that his daughter was still a virgin.</p>
      <p>Following T.I.’s words, a lot of people were very disturbed by his methods and repeatedly asked for Deyjah’s wellbeing.</p>
      <p>So far, neither the rapper nor his daughter has made any statements, and the only reaction coming from the family was from T.I.’s wife and Deyjah’s stepmother, Tin, who answered the numerous question about Deyjah on social media with an eye-rolling emoji and without saying anything further.</p>
      <p>Deyjah has remained completely silent over the matter, and her only form of response was to unfollow her famous father on all social media platforms, and from time to time, she likes some of the comments that deem T.I.’s actions as negative.</p>
      <p>However, it seems that the scandalous situation has been too much for Deyjah since she even deleted her Instagram account recently and is clearly taking a break from the all attention in social media for the time being.</p>
      <p>Pornhub even got in the mix and denied offering the teenager $1 million to lose her virginity in front of a camera.</p>
