      <p>Owner <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/evangelos-marinakis">Evangelos Marinakis</a> has had a key influence on the plans to redevelop Nottingham Forest’s City Ground.</p>
      <p>Following the initial announcement earlier in the year, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3540790">fresh images of how the stadium could look</a> were released last week as a planning application is expected to be submitted before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Phase one of the project centres on the Peter Taylor Stand, which will be rebuilt to an increased capacity of 10,000 and accommodate new facilities such as a museum and club shop.</p>
      <p>And in the intervening months between the plans being unveiled and going to public consultation, Marinakis has helped to instigate some “subtle changes” to the Peter Taylor Stand proposals.</p>
      <p>“There’s a similarity in some of the new images from what we saw seven or eight months ago, but that almost hides the amount of work that’s been taking place in the background,” said Tom Cartledge, lead architect and CEO of Benoy - the architectural firm overseeing the redevelopment.</p>
      <p>"The</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/gallery/nottingham-forests-vision-world-class-2592827">majority of the design</a>
      </p>
      <p>is very similar. There is the same capacity and number of seating.</p>
      <p>“We’ve looked again at the angles of the seats and have improved some of the visibility from the seating itself.</p>
      <p>“There are subtle changes which won’t be visible on the plans but which have very much improved. For example, the facilities - looking at the hierarchy of different commercial spaces that we’ve been creating.</p>
      <p>“Also the corner building has got slightly bigger. There’s another tier added to that.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“It is very much Mr Marinakis’ vision to create an iconic corner there that isn’t just about the matchday experience, but gives fans maybe a museum and other facilities in that space to come and experience the stand on non-matchdays.</p>
      <p>“There are lots of subtle changes.</p>
      <p>“For those who really do look at the old and new images, you’ll see the back facade of the stand, in terms of the cladding, has changed.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot more red in there, which was one of Mr Marinakis’ key things.</p>
      <p>“There has been a refinement, an improvement, a gradual evolution of the stand. But the core components are the same - similar number of seating and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3543084">a great new stand</a> for the ground.”</p>
      <p>When construction is underway, the aim is to minimise the impact on local residents as the City Ground is transformed into a world-class venue.</p>
      <p>“There’s two parts to the impact on them,” said Cartledge.</p>
      <p>“One is the noise and disruption during the construction period. The responsibility of us as the designer, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">the club</a> and the planners is to mitigate that.</p>
      <p>“That will very much be part of the process of how we build the stand.</p>
      <p>“Parts of the stadium will be built off-site. That’s things like, can we create blocks of the concrete with the seating and bring them in, so you don’t have the noise and the hours?</p>

      <p>“And then the second part is the longer-term impact of having an increase in attendance. We are very aware of that and we will be encouraging use of public transport.</p>
      <p>“And we will be looking at ways of perhaps keeping people in the stadium longer so it’s not one big release of people, as it is at the moment.</p>
      <p>“The facilities here at the moment are not really conducive to people staying longer.</p>
      <p>“There are all sorts of things you look at during the process.”</p>
      <p>It is hoped work could get underway during the first half of next year, with <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-marinakis-3541269">the aim of a 15-month completion</a> from start to finish.</p>
      <p>The club are encouraging fans to <a href="https://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/news/2019/november/send-us-your-thoughts-on-the-new-city-ground/">show their support</a> for the project, and Cartledge says plenty of work continues behind the scenes.</p>
      <p>“Any project of this nature has ups and downs and challenges. It’s our responsibility to navigate some of those,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of positives.</p>
      <p>“There’s <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/tears-nottingham-forest-fans-react-3542152">thousands of fans</a> who ask every day what the latest is - and that in itself is a problem because you want to share as much as you can!</p>
      <p>“I think over the next two to four weeks much progress will then kick on again.</p>
      <p>“But you can guarantee there’s a lot of people here having lots of sleepless nights, making sure things are done properly and that this is part of a long-term, sustainable part of the football club and the community.”</p>
