        <b>Manchester United youngster Mason Greenwood has singled out two role models he has at the club – manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and team-mate Marcus Rashford.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 18-year-old has become more of a regular in the Man Utd first-team this season, having shone for the club at academy level for some time.</p>

      <p>It remains to be seen if Greenwood can definitely make a career for himself at Old Trafford, but he looks a player with enormous potential.</p>
      <p>On top of that, he’s lucky to be playing under a manager like Solskjaer, who clearly sees the value of promoting from within, having also given first-team chances to academy products like Angel Gomes, Brandon Williams and James Garner.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7699313/Manchester-United-England-starlet-Mason-Greenwood-wants-Wayne-Rooney.html">Daily Mail</a>, Greenwood says Solskjaer is a nice guy, but also says he’s watched him as a player.</p>

      <p>The teenage forward also named current team-mate Rashford as another of his role models, so he’s certainly got plenty of quality names to learn from as he continues his development.</p>
      <p>“The manager is a really nice person,” Greenwood told the Mail.</p>
      <p>“Obviously he was a great goalscorer at United and I know about him, I’ve watched him. He’s a great manager in my eyes.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got so many role models around me and Marcus is another one. I just want to follow in his footsteps.”</p>
