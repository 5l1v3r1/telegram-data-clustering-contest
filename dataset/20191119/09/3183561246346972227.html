      <p><a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/watchmens-ideas-about-trauma-and-legacy-are-making-the-show-more-mystifying"><i>Watchmen</i>’s intricate story about intergenerational trauma</a>, police brutality, and a world forever changed by Ozymandias’ twisted plan to bring about peace has been shrouded in a mystery that’s begun to make more sense with each and every episode. With only four installments left to go this season, <i>Watchmen</i>’s entering its narrative endgame territory.</p>
      <p>The promo for “This Extraordinary Being” makes it seem as if it’s going to be the type of episode that fundamentally changes the way we all understand the series as a whole. Unlike the rest of the season, “This Extraordinary Being” is almost entirely in black and white, nodding to the fact that Angela just downed an <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/watchmen-revealed-the-big-lie-that-changed-the-world-and-destroyed-a-man">entire bottle of her grandfather Will’s Nostalgia</a>, a drug that might kill her in the process of giving her access to his powerful memories.</p>
      <p>Will’s past and Angela’s present blend together in her mind and the end result appears to be yet another devastating truth that reveals something about as-yet unknown plan that’s soon to begin taking place in Tulsa.</p>
