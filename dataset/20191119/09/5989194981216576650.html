        <b>Housing prices rose in Sweden's largest cities last month, according to fresh figures.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nationally, prices for both detached homes and apartments in Sweden rose by around one percent in October, according to seasonally adjusted figures by analyst firm Valueguard.</p>
      <p>In Stockholm, apartment prices rose by one percent half-way into November, while the market cooled down in Gothenburg, falling by one percent in the first half of the month.</p>
      <p>The apartment figures apply to those sold as <i>bostadsrätter</i>, a Swedish housing association model where members own the building and have the right to live in their respective apartments indefinitely.</p>
      <p>It is one of the main forms of home ownership in Sweden, where in practice any apartment will either be a <i>hyresrätt </i>(rented accommodation) or <i>bostadsrätt </i>(owned accommodation).</p>

      <p>The housing market is showing new signs of life after <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20181205/properties-in-sweden-cost-less-than-they-did-a-year-ago">a couple of years of stagnation</a> followed <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20170908/swedish-house-prices-have-soared-by-39-percent-in-five-years">years of sharply rising prices</a>. Ten percent more apartment sales were carried out in October compared to both 2018 and 2017, according to Valueguard.</p>
