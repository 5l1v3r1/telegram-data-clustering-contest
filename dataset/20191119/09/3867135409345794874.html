      <p>EVERETT — A man was shot through his upper legs around 3:45 p.m. Friday allegedly over an argument about a WiFi network, according to police.</p>
      <p>A 911 caller reported that the victim was unconscious in a white pickup truck in the middle of 4th Ave. W. near the Glacier Lanes bowling alley. He was taken to Providence Regional Medical Center Everett for treatment.</p>
      <p>Once in stable condition, the man, 32, told police that someone called “Pee Wee” had shot him during an argument about a WiFi network.</p>
      <p>The man said he saw “Pee Wee” at an apartment complex at 900 W. Casino Road as he drove through the parking lot. That’s where he confronted the man.</p>
      <p>Police later identified “Pee Wee” as a 33-year-old Everett man.</p>
      <p>A handgun was found inside the alleged shooter’s apartment. Some of the ammunition in the gun matched a cartridge casing found at the shooting scene.</p>
      <p>The alleged shooter was taken into custody on suspicion of first-degree assault. He did not want to speak with officers and was booked into the Snohomish County Jail.</p>
      <p>At the Everett District Court Monday, he refused to show for his bail hearing.</p>
