        <b>Halle Berry is making her directorial debut with 'Bruised', an MMA drama movie. The actress, who starred in 'X-Men', 'Catwoman' and 'James Bond: Die Another Day', not only directs the film, but also plays the main character.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Filming for the new movie was supposed to start in Newark, New Jersey on Monday, but the production had to be rescheduled due to Halle Berry’s reported injury during a fight scene.</p>
      <p>In “Bruised”, Berry, 53, stars as Jackie, or “Justice,” a mixed martial arts fighter who has to work her way back from the bottom and reunify with her 6-year-old son, Manny.</p>
      <p>According to the film's producer Brian Pitt, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201808131067152937-halle-berry-t-shirt-snap/">Halle Barry's injury</a> was not serious.</p>
      <p>"She's tired," he said. "She needed a break."</p>
      <blockquote>“Occasionally what’s going to happen is an actor might get a little injured, and we might adjust scheduling around them a little bit,” he added, as quoted by the media outlet Just Rated.</blockquote>
      <p>On social media, Berry called the opportunity to direct her own movie a dream come true.</p>
