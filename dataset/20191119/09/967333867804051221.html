      <p>The 35-year-old American, whose 21 mixed martial arts fights this year have resulted in 19 wins prior to two defeats, has announced that he's retiring.</p>
      <blockquote>"I'm retiring from the sport of mixed martial arts, and frankly, I'm retiring from everything," Ben Askren told Ariel Helwani's MMA Show." "I've been having hip problems and I finally had the discussion with my doctor. I actually got the MRI before my last fight and I need a hip replacement. So, man, that's it for me."</blockquote>
      <p>While fans were mostly positive about Askren and his career, they were also sad after he announced his retirement.</p>
