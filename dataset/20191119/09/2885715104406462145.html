      <p>The <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/tanhaji-trailer-ajay-devgn-saif-ali-khan-6127155/"><b>trailer of Ajay Devgn and Saif Ali Khan starrer Tanhaji</b></a> was launched in Mumbai on Tuesday. The film, which also features <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/kajol/">Kajol</a> in a pivotal role, will release on January 10.</p>
      <p>Talking about his role in the movie, Ajay said, “When you play a character like Tanhaji, you have a lot of responsibility to play it authentically. There’s a lot of hard work required for stunts and Rohit (Shetty) knows that I have suffered from injuries, but it’s okay. I did what had to be done”.</p>
      <p>“The most important thing was to maintain the dignity of the character. We did our research, and I relied on our director and his research,” Ajay Devgn added.</p>
      <p>Tanhaji, which is Ajay’s 100th film, has been made on a grand scale. And any film which is epic, ends up being compared to the Baahubali franchise. However, Ajay thinks the movies couldn’t be more different from each other.</p>

      <p>“I don’t think the two films (Baahubali and Tanhaji) should be compared. Both the films are very different from each other and have different stories,” the actor concluded.</p>
      <p>Helmed by Om Raut, Tanhaji has been bankrolled by Ajay Devgn and Bhushan Kumar.</p>
