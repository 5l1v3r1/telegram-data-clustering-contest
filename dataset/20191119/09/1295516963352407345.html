      <p><i>Detective Comics</i> has drastically changed the dynamic of the relationship between Batman and Mister Freeze/Victor Fries over the last few issues. After the villain coldheartedly experimented on abducted women, he finally <a href="https://www.cbr.com/mr-freeze-gained-nora-fries-crime/">revived his wife Nora</a>, except she's back from the ice with a persona that more closely resembles that of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/dc-mr-and-mrs-freeze/">Harley Quinn</a>.</p>
      <p>With Freeze now regretting what he's done, he turns to the Dark Knight to help him make amends, but rather than a warm reconciliation, in order to keep Victor in line during their new hunt, the Bat steals a ruthless but understandable move straight from the pages of Amanda Waller.</p>

      <p>Freeze knows he's created a monster he just can't control anymore following his use of Lex Luthor's serum on Nora from <i>Year of the Villain</i>. Rather than leave Gotham to start a new life as he thought she would, Nora instead wants to keep killing and more importantly, she isn't intent on being Victor's crutch or puppet anymore. Revealing she wants freedom, she freezes him and bolts, making it clear the city will be hers and she'll accomplish what her husband never could -- permanent winter.</p>
      <p>Freeze eventually frees himself and, after helping Batman find a cure for Nora's victims at a ballet, he admits he's in the Bat's debt, ready to do anything to seek redemption and try to save her soul. Of course, the Caped Crusader doesn't trust Freeze, especially as the Bat had to test Victor's cure on himself, so he knows Victor could have poisoned him in secret. Seeing as there are so many factors that could result in Victor betraying him once they save Nora, Bruce Wayne takes influence from what Waller's done with the Suicide Squad over the years in several comics, cartoons, animated films and of course, the movie with Margot Robbie and Will Smith.</p>

      <p>As he agrees to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/detective-comics-batman-mr-freeze-team-up-mrs-freeze/">an uneasy alliance</a>, Bruce quickly flicks a detonator on Victor's neck which the tyrant can't remove. It's pint-sized, but when he reveals what it is, it packs a lot of damage; if Victor doesn't do what the Bat wants, Bruce will arm the device -- which only he knows the disarming code to -- and it'll send a 75,000-volt shock to Victor's brain. That kind of electric jolt could kill a normal person but given Victor's unique physiology, it might just incapacitate him, as Batman isn't one to employ lethal tactics. Then again, Bruce did almost beat him to death in Tom King's <i>Batman</i>, so maybe he does hold a grudge, especially after Victor's vicious experiments led to ice zombies from innocent humans and animals forming in this book.</p>

      <p>Either way, it's not that surprising because we've seen many similarities between Bruce and Waller. She might be a bit more cold, unforgiving and power-hungry, but she <i>does</i> want control in order to establish her brand of peace and justice. Her Task Force X has explosives implanted, though, so it gets a bit more messy when she pushes the trigger and unlike Bruce, she doesn't think twice before she detonates.</p>

      <p>In any case, it looks like Bruce knows the gravity of the situation and as such, has adopted a similar approach to generate results. You know what they say, you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain, and while Batman isn't a villain (yet), this certainly is a desperate move that belongs in a villain's arsenal. However, given the circumstances, it's hard to argue with the Bat's decision because this Freeze War is quickly setting up to bring the chills to Gotham like never before.</p>
