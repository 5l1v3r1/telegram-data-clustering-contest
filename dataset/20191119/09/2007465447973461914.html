      <p>You may have first heard of the Giti Tire brand when they partnered with Tuason Racing School for the Formula V1 Challenge series last year. At the time, they supplied the GitiSport GTR3RR1 race-spec tires for the V1 race cars. Now, just a year later, Giti Tires has finally launched its full passenger car radial tires lineup for the Philippine market.</p>

The cars and tires were tested in various courses including a slalom and a wet and dry braking test.
