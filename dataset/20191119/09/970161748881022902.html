        <b>Usually parents leave their kids at home for a date night but Gordon Ramsay and his wife Tana seemed pretty thrilled to bring their kids along for the evening.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The happily married couple practically hopped and skipped to Claridge’s hotel in London on Monday night, to attend the Shop Wear Care Gala fundraiser on behalf of Great Ormond Street Hospital.</p>
      <p>Matching each other’s wardrobe in all-black outfits, Gordon and Tana were completely in sync with each other as they excitedly chatted to each other and laughed around en route to the party.</p>
      <p>Once inside, the couple cuddled up for photos together before being joined by their daughters Holly and Megan making for one big family outing.</p>
      <p>But missing from the action was their daughter Tilly, who is likely still recovering from her star-studded 18th birthday party last weekend.</p>

      <p>Gordon, 53, threw the teen a James Bond-themed bash at the Cuckoo Club in Mayfair on Saturday night for her friends and family.</p>
      <p>Most impressive was the TV chef managing to rope in family friend <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/gordon-ramsay-hired-ed-sheeran-daughters-18th-birthday-bash-spared-no-expense-11173660/">Ed Sheeran to casually rock up and perform</a> a small set.</p>

      <p>The Shape Of You singer performed five of his hit songs, including his biggest hit Thinking Out Loud, and debuted a brand new haircut for the ‘do.</p>
      <p>Previous reports claimed Gordon splashed out up to £500,000 on hiring Ed for the party, but a rep revealed the popstar kindly did it for free ‘as a favour’ and that ‘no payment’ was made.</p>
      <p>He’s got a big heart that one.</p>

      <p>No doubt Gordon and Tana have enjoyed the chance to party recently after welcoming their son Oscar in April.</p>
      <p>The Kitchen Nightmares star recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/11/gordon-ramsay-fainted-birth-fifth-child-literally-dropped-floor-10899506/">admitted he fainted during Oscar’s birth</a> because, you know, the ordeal was just too much to bear for him.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Jonathan Ross, Gordon revealed: ‘Tana didn’t want to see me there for previous births.</p>
      <p>‘She said, “I don’t want you to see me in this state so get out.” This time I was there and I absolutely crapped my pants.</p>

      <p>‘I fainted. I literally dropped on the floor. I was sat there and Oscar popped out through the sunroof and then they sort of throw you on him and he’s screaming and I fell back, the nurse grabbed me.’</p>
