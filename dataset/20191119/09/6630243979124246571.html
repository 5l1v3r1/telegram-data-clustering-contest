      <p>Haiti needs international support to tackle an unfolding humanitarian crisis.</p>
      <p>President Jovenel Moise made the call in an interview on sunday. His appeal for help comes two months into anti-government protests that have exacerbated food insecurity in the Americasâ€™ poorest nation.</p>
      <p>Moise also said he was holding closed-door talks with civil society groups and the private sector, as well as radical and moderate members of the opposition in a bid to break political gridlock by creating a government of unity.</p>
