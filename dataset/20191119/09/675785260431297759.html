      <h2>The dog's devastated owners are calling for FedEx to prohibit drivers from throwing parcels onto properties after the incident in Los Angeles</h2>

      <p>A Yorkshire Terrier had to be euthanised after a FedEx courier reportedly threw a parcel over a family’s garden fence - directly on top of their small dog.</p>
      <p>Devastated Napier and Mitchell Galin said their pet Cooper was sunbathing in the garden of their Venice, Los Angeles, home when the large box landed on him.</p>
      <p>“I immediately picked up the box and Cooper was in a puddle of blood", Mr Galin told <a href="https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2019/11/18/exclusive-family-blames-fedex-delivery-driver-for-death-of-beloved-dog/">CBSLA</a> .</p>
      <p>“It was painful to watch your dog in pain.”</p>
      <p>Cooper suffered serious injuries to his lungs and liver so the couple chose to have the dog euthanised.</p>

      <p>FedEx said in a statement it was investigating the incident.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said: “We extend our deepest sympathies to the family of the pet involved in this incident.</p>
      <p>"We take this matter very seriously and are working directly with those involved to determine the circumstances behind this event. Based on the outcome of our investigation, we will take the appropriate action.”</p>

      <p>However, Mrs Galin said the courier service’s response was not “satisfactory”, an that the company should automatically be looking at making changes to their driver-delivery policy.</p>
      <p>She said: “I feel they need to say they’re going to institute a corporate-wide mandate that drivers cannot throw packages; that’s what I want to hear. I don’t want to hear we’ll look into it.”</p>
      <p>Mrs Galin expressed fears over what would have happened if the box had hit a person, claiming it would have caused serious damage to a human life too.</p>
