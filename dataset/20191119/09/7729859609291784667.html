      </p>
      <p>Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are currently set to compete in the play-offs in March, while Wales may also have to rely on the new format.</p>
      <p>Here, we break down the situations, permutations and complications of the Euro 2020 play-off format.</p>

      <h3>Who's heading for the play-offs?</h3>
      <p>From the nations who have not qualified automatically from the Euro 2020 qualifiers, the four highest-ranked in each Path will contest the play-offs for a place at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>As things stand, the following nations would qualify for the play-offs (teams in <b>bold</b> are confirmed)</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Path A:</b> <b>Iceland</b>, <b>Bulgaria</b>/<b>Israel</b>/<b>Romania</b>*, Wales/Slovakia/<b>Republic of Ireland</b>/<b>Northern Ireland</b>**</li>
        <li><b>Path B:</b> <b>Bosnia and Herzegovina</b>, Wales/Slovakia/<b>Republic of Ireland</b>/<b>Northern Ireland</b>**</li>
        <li><b>Path C:</b> <b>Scotland</b>, <b>Norway</b>, <b>Serbia</b>, <b>Bulgaria</b>/<b>Israel</b>/<b>Romania</b>*</li>
        <li><b>Path D:</b> <b>Georgia</b>, <b>North Macedonia</b>, <b>Kosovo</b>, <b>Belarus</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <i>* The current European Qualifiers standings mean a draw would be needed to decide which of Bulgaria, Israel or Romania would fill the vacant spot in Path C, and which two would complete Path A.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>**The current European Qualifiers standings mean a draw would be needed to decide which two of Wales, Slovakia, Rep of Ireland or Northern Ireland would join Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina in Path B, and which one would go into Path A.</i>
      </p>
      <h3>What does this mean for the Home Nations and Republic of Ireland?</h3>
      <p><b>Scotland</b>'s hopes of qualifying for Euro 2020 via the conventional route are long over, but they do have the back-up route of a play-off spot already secured.</p>

      <p>Scotland finished top of Nations League C1, guaranteeing their place in the play-offs and a home semi-final as a highest-ranked nation. As things stand, that would mean a tie against Bulgaria, Israel or Romania at Hampden Park on March 26.</p>
      <p><b>Northern Ireland</b>'s hopes also rest in the play-offs following Saturday's goalless draw with the Netherlands. <b>Republic of Ireland</b> and <b>Wales</b> are both guaranteed a play-off spot, though Wales will not need theirs if they beat Hungary on Tuesday to qualify automatically.</p>
      <p>However, the details and even the location of their play-off games may need to be determined by a separate draw - we'll get onto that later on.</p>
      <h3>How do the play-offs actually work?</h3>
      <p>Sixteen nations will be involved in the play-offs, competing for the final four qualifying spots for the Euro 2020 finals.</p>
      <p>At the end of the normal qualifying period there will be 20 teams who have automatically qualified for the finals, but it's not necessarily over for the rest.</p>
      <p>Who qualifies for the play-offs will be decided by who performed best during the 2018/19 Nations League, and the 16 teams will be divided into four levels called 'paths', each containing four spots.</p>
      <p>In theory, the four Path A play-off spots will be drawn from the group winners who were in the Nations League League A, Path B from the League B group winners, and so on.</p>
      <p>However, this leaves quite a few gaps - there's only one League B group winner who hasn't qualified, for instance, Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this case, the three 'best-performing' remaining teams from League B will be locked into the three vacant play-off spots for Path B.</p>
      <p>After that, there's another problem still remaining. Of all the teams in League A, Iceland are the only one who haven't qualified automatically for Euro 2020, so there's three empty places in Path A.</p>
      <p>They'll be joined by the three best-performing teams still left to choose from, which will be the one remaining unqualified team from League B and two teams from League C, who haven't been locked into the Path C play-off spots.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The exact definition of 'best-performing' hasn't been particularly clear, but UEFA plan to hold a draw to determine which three League B teams will join Bosnia in Path B, and who will be 'promoted' to Path A instead. The same will happen with the League C teams.</p>
      <h3>UEFA rankings after 18/19 Nations League</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>League A: </b>Switzerland, Portugal, Netherlands, England, Belgium, France, Spain, Italy, Croatia, Poland, Germany, Iceland</li>
        <li><b>League B: </b>Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine, Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Austria, Wales, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Turkey, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland</li>
        <li><b>League C: </b>Scotland, Norway, Serbia, Finland, Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary, Romania, Greece, Albania, Montenegro, Cyprus, Estonia, Slovenia, Lithuania</li>
        <li><b>League D: </b>Georgia, Macedonia, Kosovo, Belarus, Luxembourg, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Gibraltar, Faroe Islands, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Malta, San Marino</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What's the play-off format?</h3>
      <p>The play-offs are played in single-leg knockout matches. The winners of the two semi-finals will meet in a one-off final where the winner will qualify for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>If the matches are level after 90 minutes, extra time and penalties will be used to determine a winner.</p>
      <h3>Who plays who in the play-offs?</h3>
      <p>In a similar format to the EFL play-offs, the highest-ranked team in each Path will host the fourth-ranked team in one semi-final, with the second-ranked nation hosting the third-ranked nation in the other.</p>
      <p>The host for the final in each play-off Path will be drawn in advance by UEFA on November 22, 2019.</p>
      <h3>When will the play-offs take place?</h3>
      <p>The European Qualifiers play-off semi-finals will be held on March 26, 2020 (7.45pm GMT), with the play-off finals taking place on March 31 (7.45pm BST).</p>
      <h3>Who's on course for automatic qualification to Euro 2020?</h3>
      <p>Twenty of the teams listed above will qualify for Euro 2020 through the European Qualifiers. Here are the nations currently occupying these qualification positions (teams in <b>bold </b>are already through);</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>England</b>, <b>Czech Republic</b>, <b>Ukraine</b>, <b>Portugal</b>, <b>Netherlands</b>, <b>Germany</b>, <b>Denmark, Switzerland</b>, <b>Croatia</b>, Hungary, <b>Spain</b>, <b>Sweden</b>, <b>Poland</b>, <b>Austria</b>, <b>France</b>, <b>Turkey</b>, <b>Belgium</b>, <b>Russia</b>, <b>Italy</b>, <b>Finland</b>.</li>
