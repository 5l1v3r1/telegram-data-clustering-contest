      <p>SARACENS HAVE BEEN fined for failing to attend the European Champions Cup and Challenge Cup launch in Cardiff this month.</p>
      <p>Sarries director of rugby Mark McCall and captain Brad Barritt were not present at the event on 6 November, a day after the European champions were <a href="https://www.the42.ie/sarcens-to-drop-salary-cap-appeal-reports-4895361-Nov2019/">docked 35 Premiership points and fined £5.36 million</a> for breaching salary cap regulations.</p>
      <p>European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) imposed a financial penalty on the champions of England for the no-show in the Welsh capital.</p>
      <p>The London club accepted their absence constituted a breach of Champions Cup media rules, compromising EPCR’s ability to deliver the rights contracted to its broadcast, commercial and media partners.</p>
      <p>Sarries accepted breaching the Champions Cup Participation Agreement and have paid an undisclosed sum to EPCR.</p>
      <p>The three-time European champions on Monday revealed they would not appeal against their punishment for salary-cap breaches, as challenging the sanctions would be a “costly, time consuming and destabilising exercise.”</p>
      <p>McCall’s side, winners of the Champions Cup in three of the last four seasons, were beaten 30-10 at Racing 92 in their first game of the 2019-20 competition on Sunday.</p>
