      <h2>Auto-trolley driver booked by police following complaint by wife, who also alleges dowry harassment</h2>

      <p>An auto-trolley diver from Old City was booked after he allegedly pronounced triple talaq to his wife for she gave birth to a girl child.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old victim lodged a complaint at the South Zone Women Police Station on November 16, after her husband Dastagir (36) pronounced talaq thrice to her outside Bharosa Centre in Saifabad on November 14 in the presence of her relatives. For the past one year, the couple were living separately and attended a few counselling sessions at Bharosa Centre, which yielded no result. The woman told police that Dastagir and his parents were harassing her for giving birth to a girl child, who is now three years old.</p>
      <p>According to WPS sub-inspector E Sreenu, the victim got married to Dastagir in 2011, and since then he and her in-laws started demanding more dowry and harassed her. “Three years ago, when she gave birth to a girl child, they (the accused) started beating her and were peeved over her for not delivering a boy,” Mr. Sreenu said, quoting the complaint copy.</p>
      <p>As Dastagir pronounced the talaq thrice orally, the investigators will record the victim’s relatives’ statement as evidence and arrest him in a day or two, the officer said.</p>
      <p>Based on the complaint, a case under Sections 498A (domestic violence), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code, relevant sections of Dowry Prohibition Act, and Section 3 and 4 of Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) was registered against Dastagir and his family members.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sreenu said that earlier the woman lodged complaints against her husband in Kushaiguda and Rein Bazar police stations of Rachakonda and Hyderabad Commissionerates respectively.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, another auto driver pronounced triple talaq to his wife for having uneven teeth. The couple got married on June 27 this year and based on a complaint lodged by the victim at Kushaiguda police station, her husband Mohammed Mustafa and his parents were booked under relevant sections of IPC and Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce).</p>
