      <h1>Andy Murray and Great Britain Davis Cup team quote Frozen in press conference</h1>
      <h2>Leon Smith's men had a plan for their answers as they met the media in Spain and they were in no mood to Let It Go</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:29:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:29</time> by <a rel="author">Neil McLeman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/neil-mcleman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/andy-murray">Andy Murray</a> and the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/great-britain-davis-cup-team">British team</a> warmed up for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/davis-cup">Davis Cup</a> by quoting lyrics from Frozen as they seek their own sequel this weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dan-evans">Dan Evans</a> held back giggles as the double <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/olympic-games">Olympic</a> champion told critics of the revamped competition to “let it go”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kyle-edmund">Kyle Edmund</a> , Evans and new boy Neal Skupski all dropped lines but <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jamie-murray">Jamie Murray</a> failed to deliver his quip before facing the Netherlands tomorrow.</p>
      <p>British number one Evans said: “We have both had a good week's practice, can't hold it back anymore, and get it going on the match court.” Edmund said: “Fear will be our enemy.”</p>

      <p>And Skupski marked his first appearance at a pres conference in a British tracksuit said: “if we do get called upon, we'll just have to be the player we always have to be.”</p>
      <p>The older Murray brother was supposed to say: “The cold never bothered me anyway”.</p>
      <p>The European premiere of Frozen 2 was in London on Sunday six years after the original films broke all box office records for an animated film.</p>
      <p>Great Britain won the Davis Cup in 2015 under Smith and are a good outside bet to win back the trophy in the new week-long format in the Spanish capital this week.</p>

      <p>At the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, England players had bets on who could get most song titles into interviews.</p>
      <p>Asked about the England training camp, Gareth Southgate told Bob Wilson: “It's not exactly Club Tropicana, Bob. You are not going to get any Careless Whispers from me about the team.”</p>
      <p>Alan Shearer said: “We are not exactly Dancing on the Ceiling.”</p>
      <p>Andy Murray said he would be reluctant to play five back-to-back singles this week but reported he had lost weight since piling on 10 pounds after his Antwerp win last month.</p>

      <p>"I've lost a little bit of weight - not as much as I would like. But obviously getting to practice here and hopefully getting to play a few matches can also help with the last couple of kilos.</p>
      <p>“Physically, my elbow's been really good so that's been positive. And then, yeah, I mean, obviously, if you're playing matches, there's obviously a bit of added intensity there.</p>
      <p>"So how you recover from them and feel after them is slightly different to the practice. But the elbow has been good.”</p>
