      <p>The duo will take charge of all first-team matters while the Ladbrokes League One club searches for a new manager following the departure of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ray-mckinnon/"><b>Ray McKinnon</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Miller, who made over 150 appearances for the club across two spells, left Livingston to take up the role while former club captain McCracken departed his post as Peterhead coach.</p>
      <p>Miller told Falkirk's official website: "I am delighted to be back home. The opportunity was one I couldn't refuse given how much the club means to me.</p>
      <p>"I have always had a brilliant relationship with the Falkirk fans and I am itching to get into the dugout on Friday night (in the William Hill Scottish Cup tie against Linlithgow Rose).</p>
      <p>"David and I know the club extremely well, we know what is expected and we are determined to get a smile back on the faces of the Falkirk fans once again.</p>
      <p>"We need to get results and we will do everything we can to deliver."</p>
      <p>McCracken said: "I've had some incredible memories here as a player and I am extremely proud to be asked to coach the team with Lee.</p>
      <p>"We all know the potential here and where this club should be, it's up to us now to get results to help realise that.</p>
      <p>"Coming back feels right, it's a real buzz to be out on the pitch and around the stadium again.</p>
      <p>"We have the chance to get off to a great start on Friday night and we will do everything we can to ensure the team are fully prepared for the match."</p>
      <p>Miller and McCracken took training on Tuesday morning and will have former Falkirk boss Alex Totten to assist them in an advisory role.</p>
      <p>Interim chairman Lex Miller said: "First and foremost I wish to thank both Peterhead FC and Livingston FC for their cooperation in allowing both Lee and David to return to the club.</p>
      <p>"We are delighted to have appointed Lee and David, both are consummate professionals who understand exactly what this club is all about.</p>
      <p>"It is an important few weeks for the club and I am confident that our entire fan base will show their full support to our new coaching team in the matches ahead."</p>
