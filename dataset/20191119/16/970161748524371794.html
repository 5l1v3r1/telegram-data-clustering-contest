      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/general-election-2019/">General Election</a> is fast-approaching with the big vote taking place on Thursday 12 December.</p>
      <p>While some have began to receive their polling cards already, it’s not too late to register to vote – and that includes by postal vote.</p>
      <p>A postal vote is for those who may be away from home – within the country or abroad – on the day of the poll, and would like to vote.</p>
      <h3>Who can apply for a postal vote?</h3>
      <p>All eligible voters can apply for a postal vote for elections and referendums, and you can download the forms on the <a href="http://gov.uk/">gov.uk</a> website.</p>
      <p>Those applying can specify a postal vote for a single election or choose to for a certain period of time, or permanently.</p>
      <p>A ballot paper and postal voting statement will then be sent to you in the post and included with it will be a Freepost return envelope.</p>
