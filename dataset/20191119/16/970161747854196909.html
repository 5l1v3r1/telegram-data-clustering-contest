        <b>Scarlett Moffatt has stated she has ‘no hard feelings’ about her departure from Saturday Night Takeaway, so we can all calm down.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was earlier announced that the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/scarlett-moffatt-axed-dream-ant-decs-saturday-night-takeaway-job-11178959/">Gogglebox star will not appear in the next series of the ITV show</a> alongside Ant &amp; Dec and Stephen Mulhern.</p>
      <p>The TV star had once described it as her ‘dream’ job but she’s looking forward to future projects and not holding any grudges.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <b>Metro.co.uk</b> to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the National Lottery, Scarlett said: ‘I was actually a bit confused as to why it was big news because it hasn’t actually been on for two years.</p>
      <p>‘And then when I spoke to everybody there, my role on that show was sort of like the challenge anarchist style where I was running to houses and in helicopters going up and meeting people and they’ve taken that out now.</p>

      <p>‘It’s going to just be Ant, Dec and Stephen so I feel like that’s a good trio. It’s going to be fun, I’ll still be tuning in.’</p>
      <p>When asked if she had any hard feelings about the news, Scarlett said: ‘No, definitely not.</p>

      <p>‘I got the opportunity to work with the boys which was like a crash course in how to present so I still feel like I’m winning.’</p>
      <p>Not many can say they’ve had Ant &amp; Dec as mentors.</p>
      <p>Scarlett, 29, has just wrapped up her Channel 4 The Tribe Next Door, which saw her relocate to the Namibia desert with her family to live among the Himba tribe for one month. A replica of Scarlett’s British-style house was erected in the village and all the antics unfolded from there.</p>
      <p>It was certainly a new experience for Scarlett and she describes it as ‘genuinely life-changing and unreal’.</p>
      <p>‘I feel like my body confidence has improved. Just the whole family’s life really, I feel like we spend a lot more time together because we were there for five weeks,’ she explained.</p>

      <p>‘We’ve made like massive changes since we’ve got back that we’re still sticking to like having meals all out together, all of us, including my dad.</p>

      <p>‘It doesn’t sound like a big deal but to me it is, I get things like the tops of my arms out when I’m filming, which I know doesn’t sound like a huge deal but for me that’s like a massive deal.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘Now when I get out of the bath, I’m not scared of the mirror anymore.’</p>
      <p>As well as improved body confidence, Scarlett has learnt from the Himba tribe not to ‘take things for granted’ as they ‘don’t worry about the past, they don’t worry about the future’.</p>
      <p>‘They just live in that present moment and I think we can all learn something from that because I know that overthinking consumes a lot of my energy,’ she said.</p>
      <p>‘I start thinking about everything I said last week, it’s silly. All that matters is that you’re happy and you’re kind to other people and everything else is sort of just a bit irrelevant.’</p>

      <p>While most of Scarlett’s fans enjoyed the series, there was criticism from some who described it as ‘problematic’.</p>

      <p>Scarlett had already braced herself for some negative reactions but admits she ‘didn’t really panic’.</p>
      <p>The reality star explained: ‘I knew that once people had seen the show, the majority of people would see that it’s just light-hearted.</p>
      <p>‘I know I’m not Louis Theroux, it was just a cultural exchange of families really.’</p>
      <p>As for the possibility of a season two, Scarlett said: ‘I really hope so. I’d love to meet new people because that’s the thing, when you meet people who just living in almost a completely different world to you, it really changes your perception on everything.</p>
      <p>‘So I’d love to meet another lot of people that could just teach me and my family something new. That’d be amazing.’</p>

      <p>At the moment, Scarlett is currently starring in a brilliant film for the National Lottery, created by Bafta-nominated writer and director David Schneider to celebrate their 25th birthday.</p>
      <p>Let’s face it, we’ve all dreamt of winning the lottery some day and Scarlett has it all mapped out as to how she would spend her winnings.</p>
      <p>‘It’s gonna sound too cliche but I honestly would give a lot to charity, because I feel like that’s almost too much money to handle,’ Scarlett said.</p>
      <p>But she added: ‘I would sort of build a Moffatt village where all my family and friends could live.’</p>
      <p>This is starting to sound like a familiar show…</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘We’d have our own local swimming pool, gym. Just somewhere that we could all hang out. I feel like I’d still want to live up North to be honest.’</p>
      <p>Never change Scarlett, never change.</p>
