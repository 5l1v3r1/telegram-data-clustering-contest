      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- British budget airline EasyJet announced Tuesday it plans to become the world's first major carrier to be fully carbon neutral.</p>
      <p>EasyJet said it's a carbon offsetting move that will lower its planes' release of carbon dioxide by, for example, planting more trees. EasyJet's decision to operate net-zero carbon flights follows a similar move by German carrier Lufthansa.</p>
      <p>The airline said the change would take effect immediately.</p>
      <p>"Climate change is an issue for all of us," EasyJet CEO Johan Lundgren said <a href="https://mediacentre.easyjet.com/story/13474/easyjet-to-become-the-world-s-first-major-airline-to-operate-net-zero-carbon-flights">in a statement</a>. "We are tackling this challenge head-on by choosing to offset the carbon emissions from the fuel used for all of our flights starting today.</p>
      <p>"In doing so we are committing to operating net-zero carbon flights across our network -- a world first by any major airline."</p>
      <p>EasyJet also said it's signed a research agreement with Airbus that will look at operating hybrid and electric aircraft. It said it would also support long-term efforts to develop green technology for the aviation industry -- and forestry, renewable and community-based projects.</p>
      <p>"Offsetting is only an interim measure until other technologies become available ... but we want to take action on carbon now," Lundgren added.</p>
      <p>"Many people still want to fly and if people choose to fly we want to be one of the best choices they can make."</p>
