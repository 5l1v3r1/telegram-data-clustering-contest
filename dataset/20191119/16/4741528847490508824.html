        <i>“We are currently focusing very much on market development over aid for the reason that we actually use aid money to foster our projects in Nigeria. We now believe in creating jobs for Nigerian youths. We cannot continue to give aid because it cannot be forever, but business and sustainability are forever.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“Very soon, Arla Foods Global Nigeria, a Danish company, would be creating about 25,000 jobs for Nigerians in its project in Kaduna. The essence of this project is to provide Nigerians with the capacity to produce milk for local consumption,’ </i>Kamp said.</p>

      <p><b>Speaking on the collaboration</b> of FOSS and Prime Atlantic, Michael Moller, the Area Sales Manager of FOSS, said that the decision to partner with the firm was because of its professionalism.</p>
