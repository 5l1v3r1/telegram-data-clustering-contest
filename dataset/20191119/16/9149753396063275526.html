      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:59:44+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/jorge-jimenez/" target="_blank">Jorge Jimenez</a></address>
      <p>We have found a killer pre-Black Friday cheap gaming mouse deal on one of the best gaming mice going. At Newegg right now, you can get the original DeathAdder Elite for just <a href="https://www.newegg.com/razer-rz01-02010100-r3u1-deathadder-elite-usb-wired/p/N82E16826153220">$29.99</a>—that's more than 50 percent off its normal retail listing price. It's worth noting that there's a nice coupon code that can be used to get an extra discount when purchases go over the $100 mark. If you go for this great mouse and add some more gear to get you into triple figures, then simply add the code <b>MKTCBL</b> at checkout to get another 5 percent off. </p>
      <p>If you're getting a bit of deja vu, we recently found a similar deal on Amazon for a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/score-this-destiny-2-themed-razer-deathadder-elite-gaming-mouse-for-only-dollar35-on-amazon/">Razer DeathAdder Elite Destiny 2 themed gaming mouse</a> (no longer on sale) last week. However, the mouse is so good and such a bargain when its price comes down that we can't help but highlight it once again. And for good reason: the DeathAdder Elite remains number two on our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-gaming-mouse/">best gaming mouse</a> list. This is due to its responsiveness, scroll wheel, and design. It also has great ergonomic form factor and a 16000 optical sensor ensuring its an accurate, responsive and comfortable mouse all in one hit. This must-have mouse has near-flawless tracking and is a favorite at the PC Gamer offices. At only $30, the money you save can easily get one of the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-keyboard/">best gaming keyboards.</a></p>
      <p>The really important thing to note here is that <b>the deal ends at Midnight PT tonight</b>. So act quick to take full advantage of such a deep discount.</p>
