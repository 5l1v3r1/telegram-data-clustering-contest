      <h1>Amazon Music goes after Spotify with a new free tier for Android, iOS, and Fire TV</h1>

      <p>Amazon Music is a key part of their <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/341882-long-overdue-amazon-prime-video-comes-to-chromecast-and-android-tv-and-fire-tv-gets-youtube/">Amazon Prime</a> strategy, but that doesn’t mean Amazon isn’t always looking for ways to keep extending their ecosystem. They already offer <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/342819-amazon-music-unlimited-students-99-cents/">free music playlists</a> and radio stations for Alexa devices, but now they’re revealing a free, ad-supported tier for music streaming for several new devices. <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/341038-spotifys-latest-library-refresh-is-all-about-putting-podcasts-in-your-face/">Watch out, Spotify</a>.</p>
      <p>This new free tier works just like the free-tier on other services, so you’re going to get some ads. But now you’ll be able to listen to music without paying anything on Android, iOS, and Fire TV devices, but you’ll still be limited to Amazon’s slightly smaller 2 million song catalog.</p>

          </b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The regular pricing for Amazon Music isn’t changing, however. It’s still included in an Amazon Prime membership, and you can still pay $7.99 to subscribe separately. While it doesn’t have the catalog of Spotify, Apple Music, <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/344213-amazon-music-hd-ultra-trial/">or even Tidal</a>, it is pretty cheap and comes included with Amazon Prime, which many people already have.</p>
