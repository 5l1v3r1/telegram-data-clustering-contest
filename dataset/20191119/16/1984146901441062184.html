      <h2>Up to your eyes in garden and household rubbish? Find out when recycling centres open in and around Newcastle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:26:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:26</time> by <a rel="author">Lesley Oldfield</a></address>
      <p>It's that time of the year when we're about to create a lot of rubbish to clear.</p>
      <p>So you might want to make the most of a trip to the local recycling centres. You will want to know the opening hours before making a trip so, to save you a job, we’ve done some of the checking for you.</p>
      <p>And there are also ways to check on the day, as once a site is full, it may close early. Here is a round-up of opening hours at the main waste and recycling centres around Tyneside and Wearside. You’ll find you can find one (or several) to visit any day of the week - and that includes <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/bank-holiday">Bank Holidays.</a></p>
