      <h3>Some of the best country artists in Saskatchewan and Canada will take the stage next week in support of Saskatoon’s children.</h3>

      <p>Here are five things to know about the showcase.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. The artists</b>
      </p>
      <p>The lineup is pretty loaded with local talent, from the likes of the Juno Award-winning Jess Moskaluke to <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/0608-news-anthem">rapidly rising star Tenille Arts and more</a>. The full list of performers includes Moskaluke, Arts, Aaron Pritchett, Aaron Goodvin, Jason Blaine, Bobby Wills, Jay Semko, and Samara Yung. Two more musicians — Michele Dubois and Tyler Lewis — are set to play during the pre-show.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. The cause</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Saskatoon Society for the Protection of Children runs two programs in the city: the Crisis Nursery and Parent Aide. Both programs feed into the mission statement of the society of strengthening and preserving families through preventative and intervening actions. The showcase has become the main fundraiser for the Crisis Nursery in recent years.</p>
      <p>“We wanted something that was unique … that would create more community,” SSPC and country showcase board member Gregg Bamford said. “It’s as much about fundraising as creating awareness.”</p>

        <b>3. The event</b>
      </p>
      <p>The party starts at 6 p.m. at TCU Place with an hour of cocktails before the show kicks off in earnest at 7. Besides playing tunes for the crowd, the artists will also have opportunities to share stories about how songs were created and their musical process.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. The history</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Sask Country Showcase started as a much smaller event at Mayfair Church years ago; the 2018 show was the first time in the bigger venue of TCU Place. Ticket sales are already on track to exceed last year’s show, and joint Sask Country Showcase and SSPC board member Alice Kuipers said they’ve been trying to grow the event since it became the main fundraiser for the Crisis Nursery.</p>
      <p>“Building community and tying music together, for all of us, is a really great way to spend an evening,” Kuipers said. “Those kids being with their families makes the city a better place to be.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. The goal</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bamford said the Crisis Nursery needs to raise about $350,000 each year to keep things running — and while this event won’t cover all of its needs, Bamford and Kuipers said the more visibility they can get on the event, the more it can grow. Between the pre-show, the full showcase and the after-party at the nearby Holiday Inn, there’s plenty to draw people in.</p>
      <p>“This is a growing year,” Bamford said. “We’ve got 10 amazing artists … we hope to bring people to Saskatoon and showcase our amazing city.”</p>
