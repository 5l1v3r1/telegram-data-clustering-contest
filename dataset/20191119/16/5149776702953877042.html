      <h1>'I was on the end of it' - Notts County manager Neal Ardley on ruthless Wimbledon dressing room</h1>
      <h2>Magpies boss reveals how bust-ups were not uncommon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:46:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:46</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Neal Ardley has lifted the lid on the ruthless nature of Wimbledon’s dressing room and admitted that arguments sometimes got physical if you were not pulling your weight.</p>
      <p>England star Raheem Sterling was axed from the England squad to play against Montengro last week after the Manchester City star became embroiled in a bust-up with Liverpool’s Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred just 24 hours after Liverpool’s 3-1 win over Manchester City at Anfield when both players had a minor coming together towards the end of the Premier League clash.</p>
      <p>England manager Gareth Southgate punished Sterling by leaving him out of the Three Lions’ 7-0 win although he returned for the 4-0 victory over Kosovo at the weekend.</p>

      <p>And reflecting on his own career as a player at Wimbledon, where he spent 11 years,   <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts County</a> manager <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Ardley</a> said bust-ups were not uncommon in a dressing room that fiercely demanded high standards.</p>
      <p>“When I was playing at Wimbledon it was a regular occurrence,” he said.</p>
      <p>“That was the way we rolled. Back then it was ruthless.</p>
      <p>“If you didn’t pull your weight then people would have no hesitation in doing whatever it took to let you know.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes it was physical. That was the truth. I was on the end of it two days into an apprenticeship.</p>
      <p>“But I think the details of that should be for an off the record chat!”</p>
