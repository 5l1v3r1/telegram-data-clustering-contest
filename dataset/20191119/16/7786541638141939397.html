      <p>Cook County Sheriff's Office spokesman Joseph Ryan <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-marlen-ochoa-lopez-chicago-baby-born-20191119-q6hupekrwfbuhkka2ap3gz66kq-story.html">told the Chicago Tribune</a> that Desiree Figueroa, 25, gave birth Nov. 1 at the John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County. She has been in custody since May, when she and her mother, Clarisa Figueroa, were arrested and charged in the death of 19-year-old Marlen Ochoa-Lopez.</p>
      <p>Desiree Figueroa has since been returned to jail, <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2019/11/19/20972090/desiree-figueroa-marlen-ochoa-lopez-cut-baby-womb-gives-birth-stroger-hospital-clarisa-figueroa">the Chicago Sun-Times reported</a>. Additional information was not immediately available.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Clarisa Figueroa, 46, lured Ochoa-Lopez to her home on Chicago's Southwest Side in April after they met through a Facebook group geared toward young mothers.</p>
      <p>Authorities said the Figueroas strangled Ochoa-Lopez and cut her baby from her womb. Clarisa Figueroa later called 911 to falsely claim she'd given birth to a child who was not breathing, investigators said. Tests later confirmed the newborn was Ochoa-Lopez's son.</p>
      <p>The baby, named Yovanny Jadiel Lopez, died in June of severe brain injury.</p>
      <p>Both Figeuroas have been charged with one count each of first-degree murder, aggravated kidnapping, dismembering a human body and concealing a homicidal death. They pleaded not guilty to the charges on June 26, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-marlen-ochoa-lopez-chicago-baby-born-20191119-q6hupekrwfbuhkka2ap3gz66kq-story.html">the Tribune reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Clarisa Figueroa's boyfriend, 40-year-old Piotr Bobak, was also arrested and charged with one count of concealment of a homicide. He has also pleaded not guilty, <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2019/09/10/judge-rejects-decorum-order-marlen-ochoa-lopez-murder-case">according to WTTW</a>.</p>
