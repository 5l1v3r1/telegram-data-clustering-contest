      <p><b>Disney+ | Hulu | ESPN+ </b><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/"><b>| $12.99 per month</b></a><b><br/></b>This is the best launch bundle deal available for Disney+, delivering the hot new streaming service along with full access to Hulu and ESPN+ for just $12.99 per month. That's thousands of movies, TV shows, channels and live sports events, for one affordable price point. Indeed, when you consider that the standard Netflix plan costs $12.99 per month on its own, and delivers none of the Hulu or ESPN+ content, as well as a fraction of the Disney programming, the stunning value of this deal really becomes evident.<br/><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/">VIEW DEAL</a></p>

      <p><b>Amazon Black Friday deals</b> – Amazon, as we explore in full further down the page, is going to be the among the absolute top Black Friday sales destinations for deal hunters. Amazon's Black Friday sale begins at 00:01AM on Friday 22 November and then runs for eight days to 23:59PM on Friday 29 November.</p>
      <p>In addition, Amazon is currently running a Black Friday Countdown Sale right now. It started on Monday 18 November and runs until Thursday 21 November. This is a great destination for many product discounts, with new deals dropping every day. Amazon has also confirmed that it is going to host an Amazon Cyber Monday Sale, which runs from Saturday 30 November through Monday 2 December. Finally, Amazon is following these up with one more sale, its Countdown To Christmas Sale, which starts on Tuesday 3 December and runs right up to Christmas Eve.</p>
      <p>Amazon's range of products is unparalleled, and as well as running Black Event-long mega discounts, runs daily deals and Lightning deals, too, the latter offering incredible discounts but only for a very brief period of time.</p>
      <p>The retailer's Black Friday page is already live and is already stuffed with some attractive daily deals. These take the form of daily deals and "Early Black Friday Deal" listings, with video games, Echo smart speakers, Fitbit wearables and more discounted.</p>
      <p>Last year, in the US, Amazon offered completely free delivery during the event, and it is rumoured to be extending this to more countries around the world this year, too.</p>

      <p><b>Walmart Black Friday deals</b> – No matter if you are in the United States or the UK, Walmart is fast becoming a serious destination for deal hunters during the Black Friday sales. It wasn't always thus, mind, as while Walmart is a high-street giant, it's online offerings come the big event arguably didn't extend to its maximum potential. Now, though, everything from beds to arcade machines, tablets to VR headsets, and video games to fashion and cosmetics is discounted. </p>
      <p>Walmart has gone one further than many retailers at this point in the Black Friday sales, too, in the fact that it has actually released a <a href="https://www.walmart.com/store/2648/san-leandro-ca/weekly-ads?flyer_run_id=397924&amp;flyer_type_name=ad">catalog showing many of its flagship Black Friday deals in advance</a>. This doesn't let you ring the products up, but it does reveal what discounts you can expect on hot products like the Apple Watch Series 3, Apple AirPods, PlayStation 4 1TB console, Roku Ultra, Google Home Mini, Beats Solo 3 headphones and much more. It's a useful resource for deal hunters, so be sure to check it out before the big day.</p>

      <p>If you want to make some big savings at Walmart,  you don't need to wait for the Black Friday sales, though, as the retailer has now kicked off its early holiday sale. Walmart says it's done this because this year there are six fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas than there were last year.</p>
      <p>The sale, which is also being called the Walmart Early Access sale, will run all season long, which presumable means until January 1. In the sale, you'll find <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/walmart-kicks-off-black-friday-early-with-these-apple-ipad-deals">$100 discounts on iPads</a> and it will also include deals on items in electronics, gaming, toys, home and sporting goods. Some of those deals include the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case/706203065">Apple Watch 3 at its lowest price ever</a> and <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/walmart-sale-offers-cheap-xbox-one-s-call-of-duty-deal-ahead-of-black-friday">cheap Xbox One S bundles</a>. While the sale lasts "all season" we have no idea how long each of the items will be held at those promotional prices for so if you see something you like the look of then you might want to click through and grab it before the price goes back up.</p>

      <p><b>Currys PC World Black Friday deals</b> – Currys has, effectively, already launched its Black Friday sale in the form of its <a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/search-keywords/xx_xx_xx_xx_xx/-why_wait-/xx-criteria.html?intcmp=home~Black-Friday~full-banner~1~full~n/a~n/a~n/a">"Why Wait?" campaign, which offers big discounts on thousands of products</a> with a Black Friday price guarantee. This means that the deals they have available right now will not be beaten come Black Friday. This is just as T3 predicted would happen this year, with retailers going earlier with many top offers, so it is well worth checking out these "Why Wait?" deals and, if one is on a product you want, snap it up.</p>
      <p>In terms of electronics and appliances, Currys PC World is top tier good for Black Friday deals. The retailer runs its renowned Black Tag event both before, during and after Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which extends for weeks either side. Each day a broad range of products ranging from TVs and video game consoles, to fridges, coffee machines and microwaves, get marked up with a black tag and their price plummets. Right now you can register your interest to find out exactly when the Black Tag event will begin, getting you in on the ground floor for when the deals start flowing.</p>
      <p>A <i>very</i> important thing to remember with Currys come Black Friday 2019 is that it will <a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/price-promise-1023-theme.html">price match any product against any other retailer</a>, be that online or in store. The retailer also matches discount codes, too, meaning that <i>any</i> Black Friday discount is game to be price matched. And what's even crazier is that Currys will honor this price match promise for 7 whole days after purchase, meaning that if you pick up a product from the retailer and then another retailer introduces an even lower price, then you can pocket the difference.</p>
      <p>Another thing to bear in mind when shopping the Currys Black Friday sale is that the Currys Christmas return policy allows you to return any unwanted buys right up until January 15, 2019 if you purchased them between October 31 and December 24, 2019. So that means you can do your Christmas shopping over the Black Friday period safe in the knowledge that if the gift recipient doesn't want whatever you buy them, it can be returned for exchange or refund within three weeks of Christmas day ending.</p>

      <p><b>Best Buy Black Friday deals</b> – Best Buy knows how to do Black Friday right, and offers price cuts on every product category. Ahead of Black Friday, there were plenty of top deals live in October 2019, with TVs and audio products discounted heavily in the retailer's Magnolia Anniversary Sale.</p>
      <p>That sale was something to get excited about as it came with a Black Friday price-match guarantee. It meant that customers could pick up some premium TV and AV ranges like the Sony A8G Series, Samsung A900 Series and LG Nano 9 Series and if the price ends up any lower on Black Friday then Best Buy will refund the difference. That sale is now over, unfortunately, but it's been replaced with a Top Deals event where you can save on TVs, computers and tablets, home appliances and lots more.</p>

      <h3>When is Black Friday 2019?</h3>
      <p>Black Friday always takes place on the Friday immediately after the US Thanksgiving holiday, so this year Black Friday is <b>November 29, 2019</b>.</p>
      <p>Historically, Black Friday was the time soon after the American tradition of Thanksgiving where shoppers could indulge in a bit of retail therapy in physical stores. That soon developed, though, into an event that not only took place online but spread over the day itself, both before it on Grey Thursday, and after it through the Black Weekend and onto Cyber Monday 2019.</p>
      <p>As such, if you are looking for the best Black Friday deals UK 2019 then it pays to start deal hunting in the weeks running up the big event, as well as the weeks after it.</p>
      <h3>When is Cyber Monday 2019?</h3>
      <p>Cyber Monday is always the Monday immediately after Black Friday, so this year Cyber Monday takes place on <b>December 2, 2019</b>.</p>
      <p>Cyber Monday, originally, was the catalyst for the whole Black Friday sales phenomenon to head online, with the Monday following Black Friday seeing lots of electronics and technology discounted. This in turn was seen as the starting gun for the Christmas sales period.</p>
      <h3>What is the difference between Black Friday 2019 and Cyber Monday 2019?</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BX79VdVZFXUs6xUeAszbQL-1920-80.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Cyber Monday saw some insane deals last year in gaming, computing, clothing, jewellery, and more.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>When Black Friday first started, which was termed thus as it statistically is the day where online sales for Christmas gifts really spikes, there was a clear distinction between Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>
      <p>Black Friday tended to see consumer electronics receive huge discounts and sales, while Cyber Monday's focus was more on clothes and jewellery.</p>
      <p>Now, however, the distinction between Black Friday and Cyber Monday is basically non-existent, with crazy deals and discounts on all product categories taking place not just on both days, but also either side of them, too.</p>
      <p>Grey Thursday, for example, is the Thursday before Black Friday, and tends to see some top deals drop, while the Saturday and Sunday between Black Friday and Cyber Monday is now referred to as the Black Weekend, as many top deals are typically dropped then as well.</p>
      <p>In the UK some big retailers like Amazon and Currys PC World also tend to extend their Black Friday deal offerings to the weeks leading up to Black Friday and after Cyber Monday, so to score the absolute best deals you need be switched on both during and around the Black event.</p>

          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How long does Black Friday last?</h3>
      <p>Now, to quote Ned Flanders, that question is a dilly of pickle. Black Friday used to last just a day, with high street retailers opening their doors first thing in the morning (people would camp out overnight to be one of the first through the door) and offer extended shopping ours in the evening as well.</p>
      <p>Today, though, with online shopping now a massive part of the sale, and with almost every major retailer now fully bought in to the concept, the truth is that Black Friday now lasts weeks, if not over a month. Retailers now hold their own massive sales, such as Curry's Black Tag sale event, and these now begin weeks before Black Friday and extend a week or two after it as well.</p>
      <p>As such, to really maximize your chances of bagging the tech bargain you want this year, we advise potential shoppers to be on full-on deals mode from early November, and to keep their eyes peeled until mid December, too, as the past couple of years have seen some dynamite deals drop outside of the more traditional days of Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>

        <figcaption>Expect fiercer competition during Black Friday 2019, both from retailers and from bargain hunters.<cite>(Image credit: Samsung)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>How will Black Friday 2019 differ from last year?</h3>
      <p>The major difference this year is the fact that Black Friday 2019 falls <i>later</i> in the year, and that is predicted to have BIG implications for retailers and for shoppers.</p>
      <p>Last year, Black Friday fell on Friday 23 November, which was a whole week before the vast majority of people get paid at the end of the month. It was, essentially, over the weekend of the year where most people have the least money, and while the overall scale of the sale's event last year was larger, many commentators after the event pointed to this when explaining why the period <i>after</i> Cyber Monday was so disappointing for many retailers.</p>
      <p>This year, though, with Black Friday falling on Friday 29 November, the <i>vast majority</i> of people are going to have been paid the very day the biggest sales event in human history begins.</p>
      <p>And, retailers know this. That's why you can expect even more Black Friday deals to be made available but, and here's the kicker, you can't expect many of those deals to have large numbers of units available at all. So while there will be more products discounted this year, stocks are not predicted to rise significantly if at all, meaning that the enhanced competition created by those bulging pay packets is going to lead to many offers selling out <i>incredibly </i>fast.</p>
      <p>As such, the best Black Friday deals hunters will not only know what they want but also just where and when to get it. And there is no easy way to do that, aside from doing you research (such as consuming all the valuable tips in this guide) and making sure you remain deals-ready from mid-November 2019 through to mid-December 2019.</p>
      <p>Lastly, for UK shoppers, there is also the fact that Brexit is a consideration this year. Whether or not the UK leaves the EU with a deal or not will, almost certainly, affect what deals are offered by retailers. Hopefully UK deal hunters will know more come October 31.</p>
      <h3>Amazon Black Friday deals: when does Amazon's Black Friday sale begin?</h3>

      <p>During this time window <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Friday-Deals/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=161428031"><b>Amazon's Black Friday Deals Store</b></a> will be open, with products across every category receiving crazy Black Friday discounts. We're expecting even more deals than on Amazon Prime Day this year, which as noted above was the biggest sales event in Amazon's history, so you should expect BIG things.</p>
      <p>A steady stream of Amazon "Deals of the Day" will also drop every 24 hours and there will also be thousands upon thousands of "Lightning Deals" dropping every day, too.</p>
      <p>Lightning deals are special limited time and stock deals that, as you would expect from the name, sell out very, very quickly indeed. New Lightning Deals will land every 5 minutes, though, meaning that providing you are prepared and ready to strike, you're almost guaranteed to land the tech you want.</p>
      <p>And talking of Lightning Deals, as well as many of the best products in the Amazon Black Friday Deals Store, there's one sure fire way to guarantee you're among the first in line to score them… Amazon Prime.</p>

      <h3>Amazon Black Friday deals: what deals to expect</h3>
      <p>Amazon is one of the very best places to land amazing Black Friday deals, so be sure to check out our dedicated <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/best-amazon-black-friday-deals-2019-nov-18">Amazon Black Friday deals 2019: what to expect guide</a>, as well as our highlight predictions below.</p>
      <p>Last year during the Black Friday sale it was Amazon's own devices that saw some of the biggest discounts, a fact that led to them being snapped up by eager deal hunters. The same was true during Amazon Prime Day 2019, too, so we think it safe to say that shoppers should expect sizable price slashed on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=Amazon+Echo&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Amazon Echo smart hubs</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=Fire+tablet&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Fire tablets</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=Kindle&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Kindle e-Readers</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=ring+video+doorbell&amp;crid=297BB1KLOZDMD&amp;sprefix=ring+vide%2Caps%2C137&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_9">Ring video doorbells</a>.</p>
      <p>We're also expecting some big discounts on Prime memberships and Amazon services, too, such as <a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/">Audible</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?*entries*=0&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;shoppingPortalEnabled=true">Kindle Unlimited</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited/ref_=dmm_acq_marin_d_bra%7Cc_334295605622_m_J6AoTL7t-dc_s__">Amazon Music Unlimited</a>.</p>
      <p>Amazon is also usually a great destination to land top TV deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Last year, for example, large 4K TVs from Philips, Samsung, Sony and more had hundreds of pounds slashed off their prices. And many of these TVs were 2018 models, too.</p>
      <p>Gaming-wise Amazon tends to lean towards gaming bundle deals, with the Xbox One S, Xbox One X, PS4 and PS4 Pro all seeing some very attractive packages drop last Black Friday. This year, with the PS5 and Xbox Two due next year, we're expecting crazy console bundle deals from the retailer, and with the release of the Nintendo Switch Lite, we're also expecting the original Switch to get a fat discount, too.</p>
      <p>Finally, another big area where we're expecting big discounts is in terms of laptop deals. The <a href="https://www.t3.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-go-review">Microsoft Surface Go</a>, <a href="https://www.t3.com/reviews/huawei-matebook-x-pro">Huawei MateBook X Pro</a>, Apple MacBook and Asus ZenBook 13 are all in line for some serious reductions according to the laptop deals rumour mill, so you should expect those as well as many more to pop up at some point during Amazon's Black Friday sale.</p>

        <figcaption>Expect the new Amazon Echo Buds to be discounted this Black Friday.<cite>(Image credit: Amazon)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Don't forget! Amazon's brand new hardware will be discounted</h3>
      <p>Most importantly, though, we're expecting Amazon's suite of brand new hardware, as in the products that <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/amazon-event-2019-echo-buds-echo-studio-frames-loop-more">were announced in late September</a>, to actually get some serious discounts come Black Friday. This prediction is based on past form, with the newly released Amazon Echo Show 5, for example, <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/amazon-prime-day-echo-show-5-hits-cheapest-ever-price">getting a stunning discount </a>come Amazon Prime Day this year, with 40 per cent slashed off its price.</p>
      <p>As such, we expect the Amazon Echo Buds, Amazon Echo Studio, new Amazon Echo, Amazon Echo Dot with Clock, Amazon Echo Flex, Amazon Echo Show 8, Echo Frames and new Ring In-Door Camera to all receive healthy price cuts. Amazon loves an introductory price cut, and with Black Friday seeing the retailer really pull out the stops in terms of discounts, you should expect some serious bargains.</p>
      <p>Seriously, we expect these products then won't hit the same discounted price point until Summer 2020, so if you should look to move if you've had your eye on any. These products are likely to be high demand, and while we don't expect Amazon to run out, we do expect it will run out of units that it can deliver <i>before Christmas</i>. As such, if you are thinking of picking up some presents, we advise to move fast, rather than wait till the very end of the Black Event.</p>

      <h3>Amazon Black Friday deals: how to get a free Amazon Prime account for Black Friday 2019</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CYxB3kFWSee22UExDte66C-1920-80.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Getting a free Amazon Prime account is a crucial step in getting many of the best Black Friday deals.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The truth of the matter is that if you want to be in on the ground floor for many of Amazon's best Black Friday deals then you need to be an Amazon Prime member.</p>
      <p>Amazon Prime members get an exclusive 30-minute early access window to ALL Lightning Deals, which is normally the only way to grab one of the hot products before they all sell out. As such, becoming a member of Amazon Prime is essential for scoring many of the best Black Friday UK deals.</p>
      <p>Luckily, <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/free-amazon-prime-account">Amazon Prime is available on a 30-day free trial</a>, so our advice to you if you don't have a membership is sign up before Amazon's Black Friday Deals Store opens, bag the deals you want with preferential access, and then, if you don't want to continue with the benefits Prime membership delivers, then simply cancel the trial. You won't have spent a penny, but will have bagged Amazon's best Black Friday deals.</p>
      <p>This year, though, Amazon has already confirmed that it is launching its try before you buy service, dubbed "Prime Wardrobe". This new service allows Prime members to have Black Friday deal fashion products delivered for no extra cost, where they can then try them on at home, and only actually pay for the items they decide to keep. </p>
      <p>So if you're looking for Black Friday fashion deals, Prime once more will be an essential weapon in the deal-bagging armoury.</p>

      <h3>What last year's Amazon Black Friday deals tell us about its 2019 sale</h3>
      <p>Last year Amazon started its Black Friday sale one week before the big day, with discounts available from Friday the 16th of November. With Black Friday occuring later this year, we are therefore expecting its sales to go live, at the latest, on November 22.</p>
      <p>The thing is, though, we're hearing quite a few whispers now that Amazon is actually going to go earlier than that, either under the banner of a Black Friday sale or not. As such, we recommend being deals active from November 15.</p>
      <p>In terms of products, last year Amazon's devices obviously were a star attraction, with Echos, Fire tablets, Fire TV sticks, and Kindles slashed in price dramatically. Amazon was also strong through the Black Friday sales period in terms of laptops and gaming console deals, going to toe-to-toe with Currys PC World, who normally had those categories on lock.</p>
      <p>What surprised everyone last year during Black Friday, though, was Amazon's strong showing in terms of 4K TVs, with a number of models from top makers like Sony, Samsung, and LG getting north of £400 price drops.</p>
      <p>As we've said each and every Black Friday for the past 5 years, Amazon is also the foremost destination for Philips Hue deals, with the last even being the strongest showing ever.</p>
      <p>In terms of Amazon's Black Friday 2019 showing, current trends point to a similar showing as last year, but with an added emphasis on mobile phone deals. Throughout this year Amazon has been dropping some <i>serious</i> deals on devices such as the <a href="https://www.t3.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review">Samsung Galaxy Note 9</a>, <a href="https://www.t3.com/reviews/huawei-mate-20-pro-review">Huawei Mate 20 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/google-pixel-3-review">Google Pixel 3</a>, and come Black Friday we expect to see the <a href="https://www.t3.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s10-review">Galaxy S10</a> range, <a href="https://www.t3.com/reviews/huawei-p30">Huawei P30</a> range and, yes, even the brand new <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/google-pixel-4-announced-an-incredible-camera-system-and-marked-new-design">Google Pixel 4</a> range discounted.</p>
      <p>We're also expecting a slight change in focus this year from Amazon's Black Friday sale to compete with the likes of Walmart and Currys in terms of smart home product deals. Naturally, Amazon will make a big play with its own Ring smart security cameras and video doorbells, however we're expecting more of push from brands like Hive, Tado, Nest and Arlo though the retailer as well.</p>
      <p>The result of this, when partnered with an already strong deals portfolio in terms of Philips Hue deals, means that Amazon really is looking like the Black Friday deals destination for anyone looking to augment their home with smart home tech.</p>
      <h3>What Black Friday 2019 UK deals to expect</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UYn9Pr6Bhj8GKXFjcZkYid-1920-80.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>You should expect Black Friday deals to drop in the weeks running up to and after the big event, too.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>We're already hearing plenty of whispers about the hot deal trends for UK shoppers on Black Friday 2019, and the good news is that there is going to be serious discounts on top tech categories.</p>
      <p>These are but a few of the types of deals to expect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In what is <i>great</i> news for U.S. shoppers, Walmart is tipped to go larger than it ever has before in launching Black Friday 2019 discounts across its entire store. And, anyone who has shopped in Walmart knows, that means a hell of a lot of products are going to get serious price cuts. <a href="https://www.walmart.com/m/savings-center">Walmart's Savings Center</a> is a great place to start looking to bag its best deals.</li>
        <li>4K TVs are going to get monstrous price drops this year, and across top makers like Samsung, Sony and LG, too. We're already seeing 4K TVs with 50-inch plus screens going for under £400, and during Black Friday 2019 we're hearing talk of Philips, Panasonic, Sony and Toshiba HDR, 4K panels retailing for under £200. These crazy prices are being partly driven by the emergence of <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/8k-is-here-what-you-need-to-know-about-next-gen-tv">8K TV sets</a>.</li>
        <li>Amazon is, as you would expect, going to heavily discount technology across all its categories, as well as offer incredible discounts on Amazon Prime membership. This year the retailer is going to discount extra hard, though, so the rumours go, mainly because it supposedly had a disappointing Amazon Prime Day event. We'd have T3's <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/amazon-uk-cyber-monday-deals-2018">best Amazon deals</a> page on lock.</li>
        <li>Laptops, which didn't have a great year deals-wise last year, are going to be discounted like mad, with <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/currys-pc-world-sale">Curry's PC World</a>, AO.com, and even John Lewis getting in on the action. The original Surface Book, for example, has been tipped as a product that will have its price slashed.</li>
        <li>DSLR camera bodies and lenses are set for crazy reductions, as too compact cameras.</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://www.t3.com/reviews/ps4-pro-review">PS4 Pro</a> is going to be cheaper than it ever had before, we some outrageous bundle deals incoming, too.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.t3.com/reviews/xbox-one-x-review">Xbox One X</a>, while not slated to be discounted as cheap as the PS4 Pro, is also set to retail for well under £300, even beneath £250 in some rare deals.</li>
        <li>Mobile phones, bought outright, will see hundreds of pounds knocked off the handsets, while you should expect data-stacked 4G contracts to be available for up 50 per cent less. T3's best <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/best-sim-only-deals">SIM only deals</a> hub will have all the best discounts.</li>
        <li>And, while we're on phones, the <a href="https://www.t3.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review">Samsung Galaxy Note 9</a> in particular is rumoured to be seeing some astonishing discount deals for Black Friday 2019 thanks to the launch of the <a href="https://www.t3.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s10-review">Galaxy S10</a> and <a href="https://www.t3.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-review-5G">Galaxy Note 10</a> range.</li>
        <li>Power tools and home appliances are set for a big Black event, too, with whispers indicating that fridges, kettles, lawnmowers, coffee machines, microwaves, ovens, BBQs, sprinklers, hedge trimmers, and more will see weeks of deals landing.</li>
        <li>Clothing manufactures, including major names like Nike and Adidas, are also set to join the deal-a-thon, with trainers, exercise wear, and style garments heavily discounted.</li>
        <li>With the <a href="https://www.t3.com/reviews/gopro-hero-8-black-review">GoPro Hero 8 Black</a> coming out to great reviews, we're also hearing <i>serious</i> rumours about the also excellent GoPro Hero 7 getting really fat price cuts this Black Friday. If the price is right, this could be one hell of score for those interested in an action camera.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Black Friday 2019 news: latest stories and opinion</h3>
      <p>The hot new development in the world of Black Friday 2019 news is that Amazon has just released an official press release confirming not only when its Black Friday sale is going live (00:01 on Friday 22nd until 23:59 on Friday 29th November) but also that bargain hunters should expect "tens of thousands of deals".</p>
      <p>Now <i>that</i> is music to our ears here at T3. Amazon's UK Country Manager VP, Doug Gurr, said that "we know how important it is to help our customers save money where they can at this time of year, so we’re excited to be launching our tenth Black Friday Sale to UK customers in the lead-up to the festive season. With new deals announced every day across eight days, savvy shoppers will be able to discover great deals on a huge range of products and stock up on everything they need to make the most of their celebrations.”</p>
      <p>Amazon also confirmed that the event will be its "biggest ever Black Friday Sale", meaning that it will top last year's offering, which saved customers over £40 million and delivered over 2 million item discounts. We're in for a treat for sure, but as we mentioned above, with more deals come more opportunities to be beaten to the punch by scalpers looking to then resell for a profit, so it will be especially important to stay deals-ready for the full eight days of the Amazon Black Friday sale.</p>
      <p>More Black Friday 2019 news is centered around how revenue is not only expected to be up by 25 per cent on 2018, but to be up 28 per cent throughout the wider winter holiday season.</p>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://www.insideretail.com.au/news/international-retailers-rethink-black-friday-strategy-201908">survey conducted by Yieldify</a>, which included the views of 400 US and UK retail marketers, this growth will be down to increased appetite for Black Friday deal hunting, and also because retailers are approaching the Black Event differently.</p>
      <p>In years gone by retailers have attempted to compete with each other primarily during Grey Thursday, Black Friday and Cyber Monday, dropping many of their very best deals during these days.</p>
      <p>However, many retailers are now extending their Black Event sales for weeks before and after those historically core days. According to the new survey, 85 per cent of retailers said they would offer discounts in the weeks leading up to the Christmas period, while 57 per cent said there will be offers across their entire range.</p>
      <p>“[This] attests to the trends we’ve been seeing in recent years with our clients – what used to be a race to the bottom for discounts has evolved into a more diverse set of approaches to the traditional peak season,” said Yieldify's Jay Radia.</p>
      <p>Our take on this here at T3 is that deal hunters this year should plan to stay deals-activate throughout all of November and December, as it seems clear that there will be top bargains to be bagged outside of the traditional Black Friday shopping days. Black Friday discounts could drop at unexpected times, so keep your eyes peeled.</p>
      <h3>Black Friday 2019 tips and tricks: how to be prepared correctly and bag the bargains you want</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>It's easy to become overwhelmed by the avalanche of deals and offers during the Black event, so being properly prepared and heading into the deal-a-thon with a clear head and a firm idea of what you want to pick up is crucial.</p>
      <p>To help you in this we've put together this small selection of tips and tricks, which will almost certainly help you have a successful Grey Thursday, Black Friday, Black Weekend, and Cyber Monday 2019.</p>
      <h3>1. SET UP ALERTS AND SWITCH ON NOTIFICATIONS</h3>
      <p>You should consider setting up tailored alerts to help you keep on top of the items that are most important to you. Amazon offers notifications that allow you to track price drops on relevant products, while Google Alerts and Twitter Notifications both help you keep an eye on offers across a wider range of retailers.   </p>
      <p>It’s also worth following key brands on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter as many will promote their best offers across these platforms. Make sure you have push notifications turned on so you can snap these deals up as soon as they are published.</p>
      <h3>2. CHECK PREVIOUS PRICES</h3>
      <p>Some Black Friday deals might look fantastic at face value - particularly when listed alongside the RRP or the price the product was first listed at. However, prices can fluctuate and a higher-than-usual pre-sale price can make a deal look better than it really is.</p>
      <p>Price tracking websites such as <a href="https://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/">CamelCamelCamel</a> allow users to track a product's price history on Amazon and will show its most recent price ahead of Black Friday - revealing how good those deals <i>really</i> are.</p>
      <h3>3. ASSESS STOCK LEVELS</h3>
      <p>Many online stores offer the ability to check stock levels. Keep a close eye on this and prioritise the items on your list that have lower stock availability so you can lockdown those in-demand products.</p>
      <h3>4. READ THE SMALL PRINT</h3>
      <p>As tempting as it might be to speed through to the checkout, do spend a couple of minutes checking the small print before paying. You should look out for specific information on returns policies, as some retailers may offer refunds in a shorter window than usual or refuse refunds entirely, instead offering store credit - which isn’t ideal for those big ticket items like smartphones, laptops and TVs.</p>
      <h3>5. USE SECURE PAYMENT METHODS</h3>
      <p>Different payment methods offer different levels of consumer protection. Credit card payments typically give buyers more protection than those made by debit card. It’s worth noting that if you use PayPal or another third party payment service you may lose the protections you might have if you were paying with your credit card.</p>
      <p>Once you’ve decided that a deal is legitimate and you’re ready to pay, you’ll want to get through to the checkout as quickly as possible so as not to miss out. You can avoid any delays by registering with retailers you anticipate buying from in advance and setting up a user account - including card details and your billing and delivery addresses - as this will help guarantee a speedy checkout.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping: cashback and vouchers</h3>
      <p>It is worth remembering on Black Friday and Cyber Monday that cashback on purchases are sometimes possible, with companies such as <a href="https://www.quidco.com/">Quidco</a> tending to offer cashback deals from big online retailers to new customers. There are plenty of voucher deal sites as well such as <a href="https://www.wowcher.co.uk/">Wowcher</a> that can offer some really nice discount codes, too. If you plan on doing your Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping online then these can be valuable tools to keep in your deal-hunting tool belt.</p>
      <h3>How to get the best Black Friday deals</h3>
      <p>To score absolutely top tier Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, though, you need to be prepared and do your research in advance of the big event. Which is exactly what this best Black Friday deals guide is designed to help you with.</p>
      <p>Because the truth is that Black Friday 2019, especially in the UK, promises to be a more intense fight than ever in terms of actually getting into a position to ring up top deals and then follow through and actually land them. This is because of two factors.</p>

        <b>THE T3 DIFFERENCE ON BLACK FRIDAY</b>
      </p>

      <p>T3 spends almost every day of each year reviewing and rating the best products on the market and then presenting to you the very best deals on them. The reason we exist is to help people find the products perfect for them. That's why when it comes around to the entire Black Friday sales event we are perfectly positioned to deliver the absolute best bargains going. Our team of deal hunting experts, in partnership with the most advanced deal-hunting technology in existence, filter out all the exploitative fake deals on dated or end-of-life technology and instead shine a light on the deals guaranteed to spark joy in their owners.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Firstly, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46917190">research has shown</a> that increasingly people are using Black Friday to shop for Christmas gifts, abandoning the traditional holiday shopping period in an attempt to bag a bargain. As such, there are more people trying to score Black Friday deals than ever before.</p>
      <p>And, secondly, competition is also going to be fiercer this year due to the negative effects on the UK economy that Brexit is having. Shoppers have less disposable income than in previous years and, as such, need to shop increasingly smartly to pick up the products they want.</p>
      <p>There's also one extra factor that is <i>sure </i>to have an effect on the size and popularity of Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year — <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/best-amazon-prime-day-deals-2019">Amazon Prime Day</a>. This year Amazon Prime Day was "the largest shopping event " in its history, surpassing its sales from even last year's Black Friday and Cyber Monday <i>combined</i>. Around the world, Prime members bought more than 175 million products and even Amazon's competitors benefited from increased sales figures.</p>
      <p>Off the back of this, expectations for the Black event are now even higher for Amazon than ever, while its big competitors like Walmart, Target, Currys and John Lewis will be desperate to launch huge fight-back sales of their own. This year's Black Friday is going to be a monster deals-a-thon the like of which the world has never seen before.</p>
      <p>We've got everything from basic information such as when Black Friday and Cyber Monday are this year, through to crucial advice that will ensure you don't get ripped off, though, so by reading T3's Black Friday 2019 guide you can make sure you're in the best possible place to identify a bargain and then ring it up quickly.</p>
