      <p>(CNN) - The three top winners in "Jeopardy!" history are set to compete against each other during a prime-time event on ABC in January.</p>
      <p>It was announced Monday that "Jeopardy" alums Ken Jennings, Brad Rutter and James Holzhauer will vie for the title as top champ of the champs on the popular game show.</p>
      <p>They will compete in a series of matches. The first competitor to win three matches will receive $1 million and the title of "Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time."</p>
      <p>The two other contestants will each receive $250,000.</p>
      <p>Alex Trebek will host the special.</p>
      <p>"Based on their previous performances, these three are already the 'greatest,' but you can't help wondering: Who is the best of the best?" Trebek said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Jennings became a household name during his record 74-game winning streak -- the longest in 'Jeopardy!' history -- and his winnings totaled $3,370,700.</p>
      <p>Rutter holds the title for the most money won by a contestant -- across any television game show -- raking in $4,688,436 in "Jeopardy!" prize money. He has never lost "Jeopardy!" to a human opponent.</p>
      <p>Holzhauer is the record holder for all 15 of the top Single-Game Winnings records on the show. He won the 2019 Tournament of Champions and his innings total $2,712,216.</p>
      <p>"Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time" will air between Jan. 7 - Jan. 16 at 8 p.m. EST.</p>
      <p>"Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time" is being produced by Sony Pictures Television with Harry Friedman serving as executive producer.</p>
