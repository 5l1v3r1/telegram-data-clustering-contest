      <p>The Czech government has approved plans for a 7 percent digital tax on advertising by global internet giants like Google and Facebook, the Finance Ministry said. </p>
      <p>The proposed tax, which still must make it past lawmakers in parliament, covers revenue gained from targeted advertising, providing digital market places, and user data sales, similar to the <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/european-parliament-backs-digital-services-tax-with-wider-base--1273270">proposal by the European Parliament</a> last year. It will cover only services provided to Czech users.</p>
      <p>The tax would apply to companies with global revenue over EUR 750 million annually, at least USD 4.32 million turnover in the Czech market and more than 200,000 user accounts.</p>
      <p>The Finance Ministry said it estimated the tax would be temporary until a global deal could be reached, as <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/oecd-publishes-digital-tax-proposal-for-public-consultation--1311657">under discussion by the OECD members</a>. The Czech government expects its own tax would raise CZK 2.1 billion in 2020 if it takes effect from June and about CZK 5 billion annually in following years.</p>
