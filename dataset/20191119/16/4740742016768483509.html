      <h1>Smith, Dasilva, Hunt: Latest Bristol City injury news and return dates ahead of Nottingham Forest</h1>
      <h2>The news from the Robins' treatment room</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:15:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:15</time> by <a rel="author">Gregor MacGregor, James Piercy</a></address>
      <p>At one stage you could select an excellent six-a-side team from <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City's</a> list of injured players but with Tomas Kalas and Adam Nagy returning to first-team duties, it's looking refreshingly barren in that department.</p>
      <p>Speaking at Ashton Gate on Tuesday, assistant head coach Dean Holden was able to offer some updates on the quartet of Robins players who are still out of action with plenty of positivity on the horizon.</p>
      <p>There could be at least one major first-team player back for the visit of Nottingham Forest on Saturday. And even if they don't make that game, West Brom next Wednesday and Huddersfield the following weekend appear achievable.</p>
      <h3>Korey Smith</h3>
      <p>The defensive midfielder completed 90 minutes against Crystal Palace Under-23s on Monday, a week after his first 70 minutes of action since suffering a broken bone in his foot and suffering ligament damage.</p>
      <p>Smith travelled with the squad for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/korey-smith-buzzing-dressing-room-3526983">the 1-0 win over Cardiff City</a> and took part in the warm-up.</p>
      <p>"He’s had a great couple of weeks. He’s in a great place now," Holden said. "He's now in a recovery protocol. We’ll assess on Thursday who’s in and around the squad.</p>

      <p>"It’s a great story for Korey - such a likeable person around the place. He had a terrible time with his injuries but he’s on his way back now.</p>
      <p>"Seeing him out there smiling and moaning and refereeing decisions in training is a great sight! It really is.</p>
      <p>"He’s still got work to do with his fitness but a 70-minute and 90-minute run out after the time he’s out injured is a great return."</p>
      <h3>Jay Dasilva</h3>
      <p>The left-back underwent a scan on the fractured tibia which has kept him out since the opening game of the season on August 4 and all signs appear positive.</p>
      <p>Dasilva's original expected return date was five months - which was January - but providing there aren't any further complications, he could be back before 2020.</p>

      <p>"He's going well," Holden said. "He's in a real tricky part of his rehab. He's back on the grass and back at it. Still 1-to-1 training away from the group but he's got to get these next few weeks without any setbacks.</p>
      <p>"We've got to be clever in terms of how we manage him but he's definitely on the way back up, no question about that."</p>
      <p>When asked if it was weeks rather than months, Holden added: "I would hope so."</p>
      <h3>Jack Hunt</h3>
      <p>The full-back is recovering from a hamstring injury having not played since October 19 with Pedro Pereira taking over at right-wing back.</p>
      <p>Lee Johnson's original timeline for his return was "after the international break" and assistant head coach Dean Holden admitted the 28-year-old will be assessed on Thursday in terms of his suitability for Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>"He’s back on the grass again which is great," Holden said. "But we're not too sure yet if he’s going to feature on the weekend."</p>
      <h3>Benik Afobe</h3>
      <p>The striker remains with Bristol City to continue rehab on his ACL injury sustained in training in September.</p>
      <p>Johnson admitted last week that the Robins are bound by what his parent club want to do in terms of recalling him but, as it stands he is still around the squad.</p>
      <p>That could change if new Potters manager Michael O'Neill decides his future is best served at the bet365 Stadium.</p>
