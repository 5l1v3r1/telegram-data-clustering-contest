      <h3>Even as Maha suspense over the formation of government in Maharashtra continuous, a meeting with Congress scheduled on Tuesday has been called off</h3>

      <p>Even as Maha suspense over the formation of government in Maharashtra continuous, a meeting with Congress scheduled on Tuesday has been called off. The reason given by the Congress leaders is that they are pre-occupied due to the birth anniversary events of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Informing about the development, NCP leader Nawab Malik said that the Congress leaders have postponed the meeting to Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The two sides have deputed leaders for holding talks on a possible alliance. Accordingly, Mallikarjun Kharge, Ahmed Patel and Congress general secretary KC Venugopal besides some state leaders and Praful Patel, Sunil Tatkare, Ajit Pawar, Jayant Patil of the NCP were to meet to explore the possibility of an alliance with the Shiv Sena in the state.</p>

      <h3>Sharad Pawar meets Sonia Gandhi</h3>
      <p>Even as Maharashtra remains under President's rule, NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Monday met Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi but said that government formation was not discussed. However, he said that he has apprised Sonia Gandhi about the current developments in the state. Denying the talks on the next government formation, Pawar said that his party only recieved 54 seats, then why should he talk about government formation. When asked about meeting Rajya Sabha MP and Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, Pawar laughed and said that he can meet Raut any day in the Parliament. Earlier in the day, Pawar while speaking to media reportedly said: "Really?" He said, "What talks? Talks regarding what? There are no talks now. BJP-Sena is separate, NCP-Congress is different. How can you say this? They have to pave their path, and we have to pave ours." </p>

      <h3>Political crisis in Maharashtra </h3>
      <p>After the assembly elections, the Mahayuti alliance partners - BJP and Shiv Sena had a fallout over the chief minister's position in the state. Uddhav Thackray led Shiv Sena said that the chief minister's position should be equally divided between the parties as per the 50:50 formula. However, BJP leader and former CM Devendra Fadnavis denied any such formula.  Both parties are now eyeing to form the next government separately in Maharashtra -which is currently under President's rule. While the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress is still in talks to finalise the Common minimum programme to form an alliance, the BJP has vowed that it will form the next government. The Mahayuti alliance swept Maharashtra on October 24, winning a combined tally of 161 (BJP- 105, Sena -56).</p>
