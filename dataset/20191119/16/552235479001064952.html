      <h1>Are you ready to run for it as entry opens for annual Glasgow Santa Dash?</h1>
      <h2>Time to don your Santa suit and sign up for the Santa Dash</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:33:35+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:33</time> by <a rel="author">Lorraine Howard, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/lorraine-howard/</a></address>
      <p>Nothing says the season of goodwill has almost arrived here in Glasgow more than the sight of thousands of Santas heading your way.</p>
      <p>It's that time of year when you can sign up to pull on your favourite festive suit and take part in the annual Glasgow <a href="https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/santadash">Santa Dash</a></p>

      <p>One of the signature events in Glasgow's yuletide calendar, this year it's set to take place on Sunday, December 8, with registration open now <a href="https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/article/18872/Santa-Dash">here</a></p>
      <p>And it means as usual, there will once again be a sea of red and white bobble hats bobbing up St Vincent Street and across the city centre like a festive tidal wave.</p>
      <p>The 5k fun run was a sell out on each of the past three years, with fundraisers racing to sign up to don Father Christmas costumes and do their bit for worthy causes.</p>
      <p>This <a href="https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/santadash"> </a> year more people than ever can take part, with spaces for an incredible 10,000 charity pavement-pounders being made available.</p>
      <p>And, in a bid to be more sustainable, the council is encouraging runners to use their own Santa suits this year, by offering a 10 per cent discount on entry fees.</p>
      <p>Once again, anyone taking part can pick up their race numbers and Santa suits from St Enoch Centre before they get going.</p>
      <p>Anne Ledgerwood, General Manager of St. Enoch Centre, said: "Seeing thousands of Santa’s raring to go on the run up to Christmas always brings festive cheer to the city and we’re extremely proud to once again be part of the Santa Dash.</p>
      <p>"It’s such a fantastic event and we look forward to welcoming everyone collecting their race packs in-centre ahead of the big day."</p>
      <p>The money raised this year will be split 75/25 between the Beatson Cancer Charity and The Lord Provost’s Children’s Fund, which assists disadvantaged children and young people living in Glasgow, helping to relieve child poverty, advance educational needs and assist children who are in need by reason of ill health, disability or financial hardship.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Lord Provost Eva Bolander said: "Everyone loves the Santa Dash. Now a firmly  established highlight of our festive calendar.</p>
      <p>"It enjoys great public support and is proud to be a unique, family friendly event, as well as great fun. The fun starts in George Square where a sea of Santas will start their race to  raise cash for a range of good causes. </p>
      <p>"I look forward to waving them off and I’m grateful my Lord Provost’s Children’s Fund will benefit from some of the money raised."</p>

      <p>Maisie McCormick, Community Fundraising Manager at <a href="https://www.beatsoncancercharity.org/">BeatsonCancerCharity</a> added: "we are absolutely delighted to be the beneficiary of this year’s Glasgow Santa Dash.</p>
      <p>"This is the highlight of the year in Glasgow city centre, and we really cannot wait to see everyone in their Santa suits and fancy dress running up St Vincent Street.</p>
      <p>"All of the fantastic donations we receive from this event go towards supporting patients and families living with cancer. It is because of the generosity, kindness and commitment of our supporters that Beatson Cancer Charity can continue to make a significant and positive difference to the lives of so many."</p>
