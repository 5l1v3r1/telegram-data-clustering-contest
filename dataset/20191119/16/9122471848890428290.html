      <h1>Antonio Brown Posts Message For Patriots Owner Robert Kraft</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:52:30+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Back in September, after he was waived by the New England Patriots just one year into his tenure there, Antonio Brown went on one of his frequent <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/antonio-browns-tweet-about-patriots-owner-robert-kraft-is-going-viral">Twitter tirades</a>. Among this targets was team owner Robert Kraft, and his early 2019 massage parlor scandal.</p>
      <p>In a since-deleted tweet, Brown wrote: “Kraft got caught in the parlor AB speculations fired different strokes different folks clearly.” During the same string of messages, <a href="https://twitter.com/AB84/status/1175764155359465478">Brown said he won’t play in the NFL anymore</a>, criticizing owners’ ability to “cancel deals” whenever they see fit.</p>
      <p>Bill Belichick signed Antonio Brown after he was let go by the Oakland Raiders without playing a game. The release came after <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-east/new-england-patriots/antonio-brown-responds-to-allegation-of-sexual-assault">allegations of sexual assault</a> by one of Brown’s former trainers came to light.</p>
      <p>Brown has changed his tune a number of times over the last few months, but does seem to want to play again. That is, of course, subject to the NFL’s investigation into his conduct, but it seems as if the league is content to hold him in purgatory for the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>Today, he took to Instagram to apologize to Patriots owner Robert Kraft for the things he said after his release.</p>

      <p>Antonio Brown played in New England’s Week 2 win over the Miami Dolphins, catching four balls for 56 yards and a touchdown.</p>
      <p>It looked like he’d slide right in to the Patriots machine and turn into Tom Brady’s new favorite target. Days later, allegations surfaced, and he has not played an NFL snap since.</p>
      <p>Given those off-field issues and his general volatile demeanor that has led to his departure from three major franchises in less than a year, it is hard to see another team taking a shot on him any time soon, even if he is cleared.</p>
