      <p>Atwima (Ash), Nov. 19, GNA – Atwima, a community in Atwima-Kwanwoma District, has launched a joint project with the Bavarian city of Murnau am Staffelsee, Germany, to restore the area’s natural vegetation to mitigate the effects of climate change.</p>
      <p>This involves massive tree planting between now and December 2020.</p>
      <p>The Mayor of Murnau, Mr. Rolf Beuting, led a delegation to the formal launch of the project, which has been dubbed: “Atwima and Murnau go green: One citizen five trees”.</p>
      <p>Nana Antwi Agyei Brempong II, the Atwimahene, called for all to unite their efforts to safeguard the environment, saying, this was in the interest of everybody.</p>
      <p>He pledged to lead his people to plant and nurture at least five trees, (each person), within the next 12 months.</p>
      <p>They would also be collecting plastic waste for recycling at the Free Falls Company Limited at Denkyemuoso to save the environment.</p>
      <p>Atwima and Murnau are into sister-city arrangement, cooperating in the areas of education, tourism and economic development.</p>
      <p>Nana Brempong said through the partnership there was going to be entrepreneurial skills training and the setting up of small-scale industries to give jobs to the people.</p>
      <p>A chocolate manufacturer, Barnara Kronner, has announced plans to establish a chocolate factory in the area.</p>
      <p>Mr. Beuting said they were in for mutually beneficial relationship and pledged to sustain the cooperation.</p>
      <p>He also promised to provide a newly built Fire Post in the area with vital equipment and logistics it required to operate more efficiently.</p>
      <p>Mr. Okyere Tawiah, the District Chief Executive (DCE), earlier receiving the German delegation, to his office, invited them to help establish a ginger factory in the district.</p>
      <p>Many of the people there are into ginger farming and he said, that was the way forward to add value the plant, which is used as spice.</p>
      <p>The delegation, later, paid a courtesy call on Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, the Asantehene, at his Manhyia Palace.</p>
