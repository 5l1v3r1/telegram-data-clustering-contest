      <h1>UFC fighters, social media react to Ben Askren retirement</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:03:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:03</time> by <a rel="author">ESPN</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2500597/ben-askren">Ben Askren</a>'s legacy is different things to different people. To those who saw him as a loud-mouthed, over-hyped, boring wrestler, his retirement Monday likely was met with a shrug and declaration that his 1-2 record in the UFC defined a failed stint against MMA's best.</p>
      <p>But to others, Askren was more than an athlete to cheer or jeer. To ESPN's No. 5-ranked light heavyweight <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3112020/corey-anderson">Corey Anderson</a>, Askren is the reason he's in the UFC. Askren was coaching Anderson during his senior season at Newberry (S.C.) College and convinced the wrestler to branch out.</p>
      <p>"Thanks for guiding me in the right direction as a wrestling coach, my influencer into fighting, and always giving me business advice," Anderson <a href="https://twitter.com/CoreyA_MMA/status/1196590737678356480">tweeted</a>. "All the best in your next venture."</p>

      <p>Former UFC middleweight champ <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2553993/chris-weidman">Chris Weidman</a> echoed a sentiment shared by many in the wrestling community.</p>

      <p>"You were a huge inspiration to me and many more," <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisweidman/status/1196789470063972353">Weidman tweeted</a>. "From wrestling you in high school when I was very young to watching you throughout your wrestling and MMA careers, I learned a lot from your unique techniques as well as your mindset."</p>
      <p>The wrestling program at Missouri, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/mma/story/_/id/26075817/how-bond-tyron-woodley-ben-askren-changed-missouri-wrestling">where Askren was a two-time NCAA champ</a>, and the One Championship promotion, where Askren was a champion, also paid homage.</p>

      <p>Conor McGregor's coach and teammate <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4316376/dillon-danis">Dillon Danis</a>, two-time Bellator champ <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2500691/douglas-lima">Douglas Lima</a> and UFC welterweight <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3026394/anthony-rocco-martin">Anthony Rocco Martin</a> , also weighed in.</p>
