      <p>THE Labour MP whose Westminster amendment led to the liberalisation of Northern Ireland's abortion laws has accused the DUP of "dehumanising" her.</p>
      <p>Stella Creasy spoke out on social media after the DUP launched its '12-point plan' in Belfast today.</p>
      <p>Under a point entitled "Let's Protect Mothers and Unborn Life Again", the party referenced the Walthamstow MP – but only by her surname.</p>
      <p>"The dangerous vacuum of law and guidance created by Creasy needs fixed," the document read.</p>
      <p>"This must be matched by promoting a culture of choosing life in Northern Ireland through perinatal services and valuing children through baby boxes and childcare."</p>
      <p>But Ms Creasy, who is pregnant and has been the target of abuse by anti-abortion campaigners, tweeted: "'Creasy'? I'm a real person DUP leader but you seem to want to actively encourage people to abuse me by dehumanising me in this way.</p>
      <p>"FWIW (for what it's worth) there's no dangerous 'vacuum' of law. Only a political party leader who is trying to scare women in Northern Ireland in a bid for votes."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Alliance leader Naomi Long tweeted her support for Ms Creasy.</p>
      <p>"Stay strong, Stella," she said.</p>
