        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rick-and-morty/">Rick and Morty</a> is finally returning to the UK on Wednesday and we’ve been given a first look at what exactly to expect from our time-travelling duos.</b>
      </p>
      <p>…It’s weird. Like seriously, seriously, weird.</p>
      <p>The opening moments of the episode don’t seem too bad, with Morty creeping through crush Jessica’s Instagram while eating breakfast.</p>
      <p>After being called out by Summer, obviously he gets defensive, and his mum tells him to stop being a creepy perverted cyberstalker…which is a fair enough ask.</p>
      <p>Somewhere along the line though, things start getting messy…with Morty rallying a bunch of Meeseeks to do his bidding, Rick turning into a shrimp for reasons, and what appears to be Morty trapped in some sort of weird, fleshy blob…</p>
      <p>Throw in some glowing eyes and you know that it’s just never going to be a normal day for these lot.</p>
      <p>(No spoilers, you impatient lot who have watched it on the internet already when you’re not supposed to.)</p>
