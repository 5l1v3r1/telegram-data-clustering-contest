      <p>Has the world felt real since the drop of the first <i>Cats</i> trailer?</p>
      <p>Well, get ready for another transcendent experience with a second look at the movie about singing cats who look like humans. Since the curtain opened on <i>Cats</i>, we’ve come to terms with the hybrid performers and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/18/20696129/cats-2019-musical-trailer-explained">brushed up on just what the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical <i>is</i> exactly</a>. Taylor Swift also debuted a new song entitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trIjpVH8h88">“Beautiful Ghosts” </a>— gotta give the Academy something original to run for that Oscar! — and we learned that the <i>Cats </i>twitter only follows an account called “Red Laser Pointer.”</p>
      <p>Unlike the other trailer, which was set to that one song from <i>Cats</i> that everyone knows (“Memory”), the new spot shows off the cats doing cat-like things. They lick! One of them yells “MILLLLLLLK!!!” really loudly. It also dives deeper into the world of the Jellicle Cats, with Judi Dench’s Old Deuteronomy talking about picking that special cat that will be reborn. They all look more ... naked?</p>
      <p><i>Cats </i>stars an ensemble <s>cats</s> cast that includes Judi Dench, Jennifer Hudson, Taylor Swift, James Corden, Idris Elba, Jason Derulo, Rebel Wilson, and Ian McKellen. The movie pounces into theaters on Dec. 20.</p>
