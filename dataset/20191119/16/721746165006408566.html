      <h1>League of Legends’ next champion is Aphelios, a marksman from Targon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:04:32+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.polygon.com/users/Austen%20Goslin" target="_blank">Austen Goslin</a></address>
      <p>Riot has announced the newest champion for <i>League of Legends</i>, Aphelios, The Weapon of the Faithful.</p>
      <p>Aphelios is a marksman from Targon. According to his <a href="https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/champion/aphelios/">biography on the <i>League of Legends</i> website</a>, he is mute, and is guided by his sister, Alune. Alune resides in temple in Targon where she worships the moon and helps channel its powers to give Aphelios “an arsenal of moonstone weapons.” Based on this description it seems possible that Aphelios uses a constant string of different weapons that change like cycles of the moon.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.riftherald.com/lol-guides/2019/11/10/20955171/senna-champion-guide-marksman-support-kit-build-items-runes">Senna only released two weeks ago</a>, it is surprising that Riot is revealing another champion so soon. However Aphelios himself isn’t a complete surprise. He was first <a href="https://www.riftherald.com/lol-gameplay/2019/10/16/20917433/new-league-of-legends-champions-marksman-juggernaut-jungler-melee-carry">teased last month in the champion roadmap</a>, which teased a moon-themed marksmen with a wide array of weapons.</p>
      <p>Other than these few hints we don’t know much about what Aphelios will do. For now, he’s only been revealed in a lore page and a short story. Because <i>League of Legends</i> is about to start its preseason, it’s likely that we’ll know more about Aphelios soon, since Riot would probably like to have him in the game while the preseason changes are fresh.</p>
