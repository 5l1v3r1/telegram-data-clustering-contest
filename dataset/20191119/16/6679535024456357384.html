      <p>Congress leaders on Tuesday recalled the services of late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and said that she had initiated the true development of the country with her several bold decisions.</p>
      <p>At Tirupati, All India Congress Committee member Prameelamma organized the celebration of the 102nd birth anniversary of Indira Gandhi at the municipal office junction. Paying rich tributes to the slain Prime Minister, Ms. Prameelamma said it was only during the regime of Indira Gandhi that all sections of the society in the country saw an unprecedented progress.</p>
      <p>Senior Congress leader and convener of Rayalaseema Porata Samithi Naveen Kumar said that Indira Gandhi created history by nationalizing the private banks, giving financial security to the poor and downtrodden. “Unfortunately, the present day governments are weakening the structures of the banking sector, by giving a free hand to the corporate giants, and allowing them go scot-free after looting public money,” he said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the Congress leaders and cadres garlanded the portrait of Indira Gandhi, and distributed blankets to the poor ahead of the winter.</p>
      <p>Indira Gandhi’s birth anniversary celebrations were also held at Madanapalle, Kuppam, Chittoor, Palamaner, Punganur, Nagari and Srikalahasti towns.</p>
