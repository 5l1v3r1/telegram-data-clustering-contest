      <h3>Bayern Munich go after Parrott</h3>
      <p>German giants Bayern Munich are set to make an effort to try and sign Tottenham Hotspur forward <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/279790/Troy-Parrott">Troy Parrott</a></b>, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7703739/Bayern-Munich-prepare-shock-Tottenham-striker-Troy-Parrott-eye-Dean-Henderson-swoop.html">the Daily Mail reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The youngster made his first team debut just a few short months ago, with many fans touting him as the next great Premier League forward. However, if Bayern get their way, his development will come in the Bundesliga as opposed to in English football.</p>
      <p>They are currently monitoring his progress and have been making a clear note of the 17-year-old's improvements since the season began.</p>
      <h3>Manchester United to trigger Bailly extension</h3>
      <p>The Sun is reporting that Manchester United may step in and trigger the contract extension of defender <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/212342/Eric-Bailly">Eric Bailly</a></b>.</p>
      <p>The Ivory Coast international has been attempting to work his way back up to full fitness following a knee injury sustained a few months ago. While he's shown sparks of brilliance, the 25-year-old has been unable to really thrive during his spell at Old Trafford -- predominantly as a result of his injuries.</p>
      <p>Bailly has been linked with a move to Arsenal in the past few weeks, however, United plan on taking up the option in his deal to keep him on for at least another year.</p>
      <h3>Tap-ins</h3>
      <p>- <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/156366/Raheem-Sterling">Raheem Sterling</a></b> is set to enter into contract extension talks with Manchester City, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/raheem-sterling-opens-contract-talks-20918465">Mirror reports</a>. The Englishman's current deal is believed to be worth £300,000-per-week and would take him through until 2023. Now, however, he'll be looking for something even bigger in the midst of great speculation over his future with the Premier League champions.</p>
      <p>- A series of Serie A clubs are said to be interested in signing LAFC's Uruguayan star <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/144325/Brian-Rodr%C3%ADguez">Brian Rodriguez</a></b>, <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/c-e-la-fila-per-brian-rodriguez-il-nuovo-crack-uruguaiano-dall-o-80658">Calciomercato reports</a>. The tricky winger has been turning plenty of heads over in MLS with Fiorentina, Roma, Torino and Sampdoria all looking into the possibility of bringing him to Italy.</p>
      <p>- The future of <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/178116/Diego-Laxalt">Diego Laxalt</a></b> at Torino will be decided by manager Walter Mazzarri, <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/il-milan-spera-nei-milioni-del-torino-da-borini-a-laxalt-in-ball-16655">Calciomercato reports</a>. The Uruguay international has spent the early portion of the season on loan from AC Milan, but if Torino are serious about bringing him in on a permanent basis, the fee has been set at €11.5 million.</p>
