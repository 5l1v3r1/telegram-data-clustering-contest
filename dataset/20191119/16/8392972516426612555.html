      <p>Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4-qPt8nYP7/">NewfoodsUK</a> posted a photo of the treats and told followers: "New! @mullerukandireland Corner Pretzel Party! How good do these sound!?</p>

      <p>But some users who claimed to have tried them said they didn't think the Müller yoghurts were as delicious as they sound.</p>
      <p>"Sadly not as good as they sound," said one.</p>
      <p>"They don't taste that great," commented another.</p>
      <p>One Instagram user compared them to Müller's mince pie flavour yoghurts and suggested the pretzel variety could be nicer, writing: "Hmm might be better than the mince pie since they're not 'light."</p>

      <p>Müller isn't the only company offering a wintry twist on its usual fare.</p>

      </p>
      <p>There are three new items on the menu - the KFC Festive Burger, Festive Fries and a new Mint Choc Krushem Soft Serve drink.</p>
      <p>Similarly, sandwich chain Subway has launched its Christmas menu, although potential customers appeared dissatisfied with the offering.</p>
      <p>Subway's seasonal range includes the Ultimate Cheesy Garlic Bread Steak Sub, mince pie cookies and gingerbread coffee, but many social media users <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/subway-customers-disappointed-with-festive-sandwich-changes-to-christmas-2019-menu/">feel the offerings are not all that festive</a>.</p>
