      <p>A cellphone users survey shows British Columbia residents are frustrated and confused with cellphone contracts and billing, prompting a deeper review of consumer protection laws and expanded efforts to push the federal government for improvements.</p>
      <p>Premier John Horgan has appointed Maple Ridge New Democrat Bob D'Eith to advocate for more affordable and transparent cellphone options.</p>
      <p>D'Eith says a recent government survey about cellphone issues received more than 15,000 responses from people wanting easy-to-understand contracts, transparent bills and affordable plans.</p>
      <p>The New Democrats promised in last February's throne speech to provide consumers with tools to receive the least expensive service possible.</p>
      <p>D'Eith says cellphone issues are largely subject to federal regulations, but that will not stop the province from lobbying Ottawa to make affordability and transparency improvements.</p>
      <p>He says the B.C. government will embark on a deeper examination of cellphone issues, including a legislative review of the province's consumer protection laws to ensure users are familiar with their rights and protections.</p>
