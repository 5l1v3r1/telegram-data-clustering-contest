      <h1>Size 8 woman has debilitating condition which makes her legs size 20</h1>

      <p>A mum-of-six has been left housebound after a debilitating condition caused her legs to rapidly grow in size.</p>
      <p>Claire Oldfield, 37, always had ‘chunky’ legs as a child and was diagnosed with lipoedema at the age of 14.</p>
      <p>However, after giving birth to her eldest daughter aged 21, her legs started to balloon and she now wears size eight clothing on her top half, and a size 20 on her bottom.</p>
      <p>Claire, from Huddersfield, told Metro.co.uk she also struggles to turn in bed due to the ‘excruciating pain’ in her legs, and fears she could end up in a wheelchair within the next five years.</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘I’ve gone completely downhill to the point I just want to cut my legs off.</p>

      <p>‘I just feel so depressed I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m still young and this condition is ruining my life completely.</p>

      <p>‘I get a lot of swelling in my legs and it can be extremely painful, even if the kids just put their hands on my lap.</p>
      <p>‘I was able to do so much with my oldest children, because I wasn’t so affected when they were little, but now with my youngest, I can’t do anything. I feel so guilty all the time.</p>
      <p>‘I used to go to the gym three times a week, but now I walk with a stick and need a lift to get me in and out of the bath.’</p>
      <p>Claire’s condition first deteriorated when she had her eldest daughter, and then worsened once again when she gave birth to her youngest girl, who is now three.</p>
      <p>She had previously worked for Kirkwood Hospice, in Dalton, and a nearby junior school, but is now on disability benefits after her condition prevented her from returning from maternity leave.</p>
      <p>Claire explained: ‘I’m now stuck in the house now nearly 24 hours a day, seven days a week and I only really pop out for medical appointments.</p>

      <p>‘When I do go out, I get a bit anxious because I feel like people are staring at me or judging me because I can’t find clothes to fit.</p>

      <p>‘I’ve got the tiniest little waist that is a size eight to 10, but then I need to get my bottoms in a size 20.</p>
      <p>‘The majority of the time I’m just at home in my pyjamas and some slip on shoes because it’s the easiest thing to do.’</p>
      <p>Lipoedema involves the abnormal build-up of fat cells in the legs, thighs and buttocks, causing them to swell up and feel ‘doughy’ in texture.</p>
      <p>The deteriorating condition is resistant to diet and exercise – yet, despite affecting 11% of the British population, there is currently no effective treatment for it available on the NHS.</p>
      <p>The best way to beat the condition is by undergoing rounds of liposuction, which the NHS only classes as a cosmetic procedure.</p>
      <p>Claire said: ‘Every time I am told I can’t have funding because it’s cosmetic, it’s horrible.</p>

      <p>‘It’s not just the fact of how it looks. I think could live with that. It’s the pain that comes with it. It’s not being able to go anywhere or do anything.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t want to look like a supermodel. I’ve never worn short skirts in all my life, except for at school when I was made to wear them.</p>
      <p>‘I miss doing things normal people do, like running around the park or socialising with friends.’</p>

      <p>Claire, who also suffers from fibromyalgia and anxiety, has now set up a GoFundMe page in a bid to raise money for three rounds of liposuction, with each surgery costing 6,000.</p>
