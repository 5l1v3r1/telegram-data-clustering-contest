      <p>My favourite type of activity for little kids is something that keeps them busy <i>and</i> accomplishes another goal. Like when they help sort laundry or “prep” dinner with you. Kids like hands-on activities and they like to be helpful. And this mum scratches both of those itches with this simple toy-washing station:</p>

      <p>All you need is a plastic tub, a couple of smaller containers, water, dish soap, a sponge or rag, and a surface you don’t mind getting splashed with soapy water. Outside is probably your best bet for this activity but if that isn’t an option, throw some towels down in the mudroom or on the bathroom floor—or use a couple of smaller tubs and put the whole set-up directly into the bathtub.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3XmPMBH8dZ/">dayswithgrey</a> points out, the toys don’t have to be visibly dirty for kids to get into this, but they could probably use a good scrub anyway.</p>
