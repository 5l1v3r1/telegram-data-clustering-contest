      <h1>Rocky road - Stan Collymore recalls Forest fight after Liverpool and Man City stars clash</h1>
      <h2>Nottingham Forest latest | Collymore gives insight into possible response to England incident with a story from his time as a Forest player</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:26:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:26</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Murray</a></address>
      <p>Stan Collymore has explained how a "training-ground fight" with Alf Inge Haaland during his <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> days means he can relate to Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez after their recent altercation while on England duty.</p>
      <p>Manchester City forward Sterling was dropped for the Three Lions' European Championship qualifying win over Montenegro last week "as a result of a disturbance in a private team area".</p>
      <p>Gomez was later pictured at training with a small cut under his eye, although it was not confirmed whether that came from the incident.</p>
      <p>Former Forest and Liverpool star <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/best-manager-played-under-stan-2426687">Collymore</a> has given his response to the England talking point - and suggesting the sort of welcome back into the changing room players can get after similar incidents.</p>
      <p>"The day after I knocked out Alf Inge Haaland in a training-ground fight, I walked back into the dressing-room to be greeted by Stuart Pearce and the lads singing the Rocky theme tune," <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/forest-players-sang-rocky-theme-20915165">Collymore wrote in his Daily Mirror column.</a></p>
      <p>"I mention this because people will think life will be all dark and sullen for Raheem Sterling after his bust-up with Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>"But, trust me, footballers have a great way of welcoming one of their team-mates back into the group and it’s usually by giving you a good, old sledging.</p>
      <p>"Pep Guardiola will perhaps grab Sterling for a quick debrief on the situation and tell him to get his head down, and there’s no better game for him to do that than Saturday’s against a young Chelsea side."</p>
      <p>Collymore netted an eye-catching 41 goals in 65 League appearances for Forest between 1993 and 1995, before a big-money move to Anfield.</p>
      <p>He won three England caps.</p>
