      <p>The Sant Sangam (a congregation of seers and sants) unanimously urged the Union government to fully ban cow slaughter, implement Uniform Civil Code and bring in a law to control the growth of population in the country here on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the occasion, Vishwesha Tirtha Swami of Pejawar Mutt said that cow should be made the national animal of the country in the place of tiger. “As tiger is the national animal of the country, there are instances of terrorism. If we make cow the national animal, there will be peace in the country. Cow is the mother of all Indians,” he said.</p>
      <p>Purification of the Ganga should be given priority. “It is Ganga which should purify us, but unfortunately it has become so polluted that now we have to take steps to purify it,” he said.</p>
      <p>Uniform Civil Code was required in the country so that there is unity even among diversities. “All sants should hold discussions with the religious leaders of the Muslim, Christian, Sikh and other communities for this purpose,” he said.</p>
      <p>But there was confusion on some aspects while there was a demand to allow women into mosques, there was opposition for entry of women into the Sabarimala temple. The Sabarimala matter had now been referred to a larger Bench of the Supreme Court, he said.</p>
      <p>Population control was a must in the country. It should apply equally to all communities. “I want to see the Ram Temple constructed in Ayodhya during my life-time. There should be Ram Rajya in the country,” the seer said.</p>
      <p>Yoga guru Baba Ramdev said that Uniform Civil Code was a necessity. A movement for Uniform Civil Code would be started.</p>
      <p>Non-vegetarianism was responsible for global warming. There should be a law against cow slaughter. “As much as 99 % of Muslims in the country were converts. Even during the rule of Babar, Akbar and Aurangzeb, there was ban on cow slaughter. Leave the cow alone, eat other animals if you want,” Mr. Ramdev said.</p>
      <p>Vidyadheesha Tirtha Swami of Paryaya Palimar Mutt presided over the function.</p>
