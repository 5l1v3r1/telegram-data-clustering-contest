      <p>Estimated at £250,000-£350,000 ($324,000-$454,000), the dress is one of three being sold by Kerry Taylor Auctions on December 9.</p>
      <p>They also include a long-sleeved dress from 1986 by Katherine Cusack, also in midnight-blue velvet, and a Catherine Walker navy wool day dress from around 1989.</p>
      <p>The Edelstein dress was part of a collection of outfits that Diana herself sold for charity at auction in June 1997, just weeks before she was killed in a car crash in Paris.</p>
