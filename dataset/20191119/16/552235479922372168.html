      <p>Restaurant chain Tony Macaroni will open its doors in Irvine before Christmas.</p>
      <p>The Italian venue will move into the former Frankie &amp; Benny’s unit in the Riverway Retail Park. </p>
      <p>A delivery service will be on offer, North Ayrshire Council licensing board heard. </p>
      <p>Customers will be able to order grub complete with booze to come to their doors after councillors approved a licensing application from the firm. </p>
      <p>An agent assured councillors at the meeting Tony Macaroni is a “food-led business” and alcohol-only sales equate to a small percentage of sales.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Agent Peter Lawson said if someone orders pasta and pizza along with alcohol delivery staff would check their age. </p>
      <p>He said: “Alcohol would never be delivered without food.”</p>
      <p>And he pointed out the booze from Tony Macaroni would be more expensive than supermarkets and in line with normal eatery prices. </p>
      <p>He said: “It is a straightforward restaurant application. We are tidying up the licence and want to add deliveries to it.”</p>
      <p>The business applied for a variation and transfer of premises licence, which was passed by councillors.</p>
      <p>Licensing board chair Ronnie McNicol said he had eaten in Tony Macaroni in Largs and Edinburgh. He said: “I know your menu well.”</p>
