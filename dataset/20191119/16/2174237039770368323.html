      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/ozzy-osbourne-solo-albums-ranked-from-worst-to-best">Ozzy Osbourne</a> will make his long-awaited return to the stage at the American Music Awards later this month.</p>
      <p>The ceremony will take place at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on November 24, with <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/8543908/2019-american-music-awards-performers-christina-aguilera-great-big-world-post-malone-ozzy-osbourne-green-day">Billboard</a> reporting that Ozzy will perform <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/listen-to-ozzy-osbournes-post-malone-collaboration-take-what-you-want"><i>Take What You Want</i></a> with Post Malone, Travis Scott and Andrew Watt on the night.</p>
      <p>It’ll be Ozzy’s first time back on stage after what’s been a difficult year for the former <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/black-sabbath-a-guide-to-their-best-albums">Black Sabbath</a> legend.</p>
      <p>Ozzy was forced to postpone all of his 2019 touring plans after he was <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ozzy-osbourne-hospitalised">hospitalised with pneumonia</a> and, just as he was recovering, he fell at home, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/sharon-osbourne-describes-extent-of-ozzys-injuries-after-recent-fall">injuring his back, neck and shoulders – dislodging the metal rods he had inserted following his 2003 ATV accident in the process</a>.</p>
      <p>He later called 2019 <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ozzy-osbourne-2019-has-been-one-of-the-most-f-up-years-of-my-life">“one of the most fucked-up years of my life”</a> but with his new album <i>Ordinary Man</i> out in January and his <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ozzy-osbourne-announces-rescheduled-no-more-tours-2-uk-and-european-dates">rescheduled tour dates taking place throughout 2020</a>, things are looking up for Ozzy. </p>
      <p>He also released his new single <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/ozzy-announces-new-album-ordinary-man-listen-to-first-single-under-the-graveyard"><i>Under The Graveyard</i></a> earlier this month, while his solo album box set <i>See You On The Other Side</i> is out later this month, with the collection <a href="https://ozzyosbourne.tmstor.es/?lf=075a45c221b086b3abe3089e9453bc44">available to pre-order through Ozzy’s website</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/green-day-all-you-need-to-know">Green Day</a> will also be at the AMAs to celebrate the 25th anniversary of <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/how-green-days-dookie-dragged-punk-rock-into-the-mainstream"><i>Dookie</i></a>, and will play <i>Basket Case</i> and their recent single <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/watch-green-day-play-new-single-father-of-all-live-for-the-very-first-time"><i>Father Of All...</i></a>.</p>
