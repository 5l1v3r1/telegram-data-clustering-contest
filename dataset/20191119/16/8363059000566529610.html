      <h1>Star Wars-Themed Galaxy Note 10+ Launches Next Month</h1>

      <p>Samsung has unveiled its <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> Galaxy Note 10+ ahead of the film's release on December 20.</p>
      <p>The black handset sports the red detailing - which extends to the S Pen - and includes a specially-designed case with a metal badge. It screams Dark Side, and may just lure you over if you have the cash. It drops in the US on December 13 with a price tag of $1,299.99.</p>

      <p>The phone is set for release here in the UK at some point, but a date and price has yet to be confirmed. If we work on the assumption of a straight conversion, that puts the cost in the ballpark of Â£1,000, but it's likely the price will be bumped up somewhat.</p>

      <p>Samsung also dropped an ad to accompany the new colourway, but the actual phone is nowhere to be seen. There is, however, a Chewie dog and a cat intent on turning the kid in the advert to the dark side, so that's fun.
