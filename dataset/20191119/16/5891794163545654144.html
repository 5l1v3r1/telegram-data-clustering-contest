      <p>ALMATY, Kazakhstan -- Four Kazakh activists have been sentenced to one year of freedom limitation -- a sentence with parole-like restrictions -- for supporting a banned opposition movement.<br/><br/>A court in Kazakhstan’s largest city, Almaty, pronounced its ruling against Anuar Ashiraliev and three women, Oksana Shevchuk, Gulzipa Zhaukerova, and Zhazira Demeuova, on November 19.<br/><br/>The court also sentenced Ashiraliev, Zhaukerova, and Demeuova to 100 hours of community work each.<br/><br/>The four were arrested in July for attending rallies in May to protest an early presidential election in Kazakhstan as well as the renaming of the capital, Astana, as Nur-Sultan after the name of former President Nursultan Nazarbaev.<br/><br/>Demeuova was later transferred to house arrest.<br/><br/>The arrest of the three women, who are all mothers of young children, prompted an outcry in Kazakhstan.<br/><br/>Investigators have charged that the four activists are members or supporters of the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan, a banned political party led by the self-exiled former banker and businessman Mukhtar Ablyazov.<br/><br/>Ablyazov, who has lived outside of Kazakhstan since 2009, is an outspoken opponent of Kazakhstan’s governing elite.<br/><br/>In 2018, a court in the Kazakh capital banned the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan as an extremist organization.</p>
