      <p>Stonebwoy’s Ashaiman to the World Concert has been scheduled for November 30, 2019 at the same venue which has been hosting it since its inception, the Saka Saka Park.</p>
      <p>A tall list of artists like Nana Boroo, Obrafour, Samini, Kwaw Kese, Quamima MP, Medikal, Fameye and a host of others will mount the stage to thrill thousands of music lovers who will throng to the venue.</p>
      <p>Initially, a crestfallen Stonebwoy had revealed that for the first time since the show was birthed, it won’t be hosted this year.</p>
      <p>Stonebwoy had told Nana ADWOA Sarkodie of Cities News thus:</p>
      <p>The reality is that, for us to have done it four years running, we wish it will stay. One of the major reasons why it is looking like it might not be a possibility [this year], though it has not been written off totally, is because the area is being sold…There is some confusion going on regarding that issue.”</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to set a date for them to start the project so that’s what is going on now. I am contemplating if it’s going to happen or not. Even if it doesn’t happen this year, it will definitely happen next year. An election year gives me a stronger stance to make it happen because I need that to unify the people like I have always done giving a platform to opinion leaders to come and educate the masses. Ashaiman to the world is forever but doesn’t have to happen each year,” he stated.</p>
      <p>Well, it is refreshing the entertainment packed concert will go ahead and we know this is a welcoming news to all Bhim fans.</p>
