      <h1>Ashutosh Gowariker wants to make a film on Buddha after Panipat</h1>

      <p>AshutoshGowariker is back with yet another historical drama called Panipat. Set in the 18th century Panipat stars Arjun Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt and Kriti Sanon and is based on the historic third battle of Panipat.</p>
      <p>Talking about the film Ashutosh said, “We have all read about the Panipat battle but how many of us know that there were three battles of Panipat, and the third which we are bringing to the screen, was the most inspiring? For the first time in history, anywhere in the world, an army travelled 1,000 kilometres to stop an invader. Since the film is an audiovisual medium, it’ll take you beyond textbooks. And while I like to be authentic in my depiction, I also like to tell a story in an entertaining way. I can’t think of making a film without songs; elements like music keep the audience engaged. “</p>

      <p>Already an expert in the genre, when quizzed about a film he wishes to make, he added “I haven’t explored Ancient India yet. I’d want to make a film on Buddha, on how Prince Siddhartha became Buddha. What happened to bring the change, the answers he found...”</p>
      <p>Here’s hoping to see the epic story of Buddha come on the big screen at the hands of this director, till then here’s wishing both Ashutosh and the team of Panipat a great success.</p>
