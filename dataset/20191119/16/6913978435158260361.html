      <p><b>GENEVA —</b> The UN rights office said on Tuesday it was alarmed by reports that live ammunition was used against protesters in Iran and had caused a significant number of deaths across the country.<br/><br/>Demonstrations broke out in the Islamic republic on Friday after Tehran announced the price of petrol would be raised by as much as 200 percent in the sanctions-hit country.<br/><br/>The UN human rights office was "especially alarmed that the use of live ammunition has allegedly caused a significant number of deaths across the country," spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters.<br/><br/>Iran has been largely offline since internet restrictions were imposed the day after the demonstrations began.<br/><br/>Colville said casualty details were hard to verify, in part because of the internet shutdown.<br/><br/>But he added: "Iranian media and a number of other sources suggest dozens of people may have been killed and many people injured during protests in at least eight different provinces, with over 1,000 protesters arrested."<br/><br/>"We urge the Iranian authorities and security forces to avoid the use of force to disperse peaceful assemblies."<br/><br/>The full extent of the protests remains unclear, largely as a result of the internet restrictions.<br/><br/>But the demonstrations have seen masked young men set alight petrol stations, banks and other public property.<br/><br/>Colville also called on protesters to demonstrate peacefully, "without resorting to physical violence or destruction of property". — AFP</p>
