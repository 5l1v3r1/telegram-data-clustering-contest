      <p><u><a href="https://wrench.com/">Wrench</a></u> is serving as a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/innovation/2019/digital-disruption-meets-automotive-repairs/">mobile source</a> of mechanics – and saving consumers a trip to the auto repair shop. In retail, the <a href="https://flattummyco.com/">Flat Tummy</a> Instagram brand was able to make an <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2019/an-instabrands-innovation-journey-into-experiential-wellness">effective algorithm</a> that could accurately predict the effect an influencer would have on pushing its line of teas.
