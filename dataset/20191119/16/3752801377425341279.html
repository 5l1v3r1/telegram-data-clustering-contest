      <p>A former control prosecutor at the Atlantis Magistrate's Court has been jailed after being convicted for possession of child pornography and sexual assault.</p>
      <p>Dawid Lotz, 44, entered into a plea agreement with the State in the Parow Regional Court and was sentenced on Monday.</p>
      <p>He was given a 10-year jail term, of which three years were suspended for five years, said Western Cape police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk.</p>
      <p>He faced 156 charges involving child pornography and one of sexual assault, saidÂ regional National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila.</p>
      <p>Sonja Harri, the provincial head of the family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit, oversaw an investigation into a person of interest at the court in October 2016.</p>
      <p>It came to light that Lotz was that person, and the police obtained search warrants for his office at court and home in Malmesbury.</p>
      <p>A total of 125 images and 31 videos were found on his devices.</p>
      <p>Lotz was arrested and appeared in court at the end of 2016.</p>
      <p>In terms of the plea agreement, his name will be recorded in the sexual offences register and he has been found unfit to work with children and to possess a firearm.</p>
      <p>Ntabazalila welcomed the sentence.</p>
      <p>He said Lotz resigned immediately after he was suspended in December 2016.</p>
