      <p>Officers hunting a suspected stolen vehicle swooped on a Sutton Coldfield street with the police helicopter hovering overhead.</p>
      <p>The dramatic chase took place on a four-mile route from Witton Lodge Road in Erdington to Links View in Streetly, close to Sutton Park, on Sunday (November 17) at around 9pm.</p>
      <p>Eyewitnesses reported the police helicopter tracking the car through Erdington, Banners Gate and Streetly. Police are believed to have attempted to stop the vehicle using a ‘stinger’ strip of spikes by the Shell garage.</p>

      <p>A witness on the Streetly Neighbourhood Alerts Facebook page said: “There was a police car on the shell exit slip packing away what looked like a stinger strip and further round the island at Thornhill Road there were other police cars and a helicopter above.”</p>
      <p>The police stop in Links View was captured on Lisa Williams’ Ring video doorbell camera. Ms Williams said: “The incident came up on out doorbell camera as the motion detection was set off.</p>
      <p>The video appears to show police offers shouting and then detaining someone.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“It looked like they had someone on the floor. Apparently there was lots of goings all around.</p>
      <p>“Me and my boyfriend are horrified as we normally walk the dog around this time and we could've been caught up in some kind of crossfire or whatever else was going on. Luckily we were out and when we got back there was still an unmarked police car in our close.”</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: “Police spotted a suspected stolen car in Witton Lodge Road in Erdington, at just after 9.05pm on Sunday (November 17). Following a short pursuit the car stopped in Links View, Streetly, and the driver was spoken to.</p>
      <p>“Enquiries are ongoing.”</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made.</p>
