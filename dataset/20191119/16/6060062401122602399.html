      </ul>
      <p>Business Insider is assembling its annual list of hottest adtech companies and seeking nominations this year.</p>
      <p>From new laws like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/marketers-are-freaking-out-about-ccpa-us-privacy-laws-2019-9">the upcoming California Consumer Privacy Act</a> and big moves from Apple <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/winners-and-losers-google-cutting-back-on-third-party-data-2019-5">and Google</a> to clamp down on third-party cookies, privacy concerns and regulation scrutiny rocked adtech this year.</p>
      <p>At the same time, adtech companies are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-ad-tech-ott-companies-2019-2019-3">shaking up the $70 billion TV industry</a> with technology that can target and measure ads, as shown by acquisitions like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/roku-buys-dataxu-to-beef-up-ott-advertising-analysis-2019-10">Roku buying Dataxu,</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-at-t-advertising/atts-xandr-purchases-tv-advertising-company-clypd-source-idUSKBN1WW30G">AT&amp;T's Xandr acquisition of Clypd</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/liveramp-is-buying-data-plus-math-for-150-million-2019-6">LiveRamp's acquisition of Data Plus Math</a>.</p>
      <p>As in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-intriguing-adtech-martech-startups-2018-11">past years,</a> we plan to publish a list of the hottest adtech companies are driving change by helping publishers, agencies and brands solve problems and raising funding in a difficult climate.</p>
      <p>Please read the details below before <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfOXWxaP5GcyuAaav_vpuyC6SA0v-6F41C8VzCBt7rtdzHb0g/viewform">submitting your nomination here</a> by November 22.</p>
      <h3>What we're looking for</h3>
      <p>We're looking to spotlight public and private adtech companies and a diverse group of people who have been instrumental to these companies' 2019 strategy, from the CEO level on down.</p>
      <p>As we recently published <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/marketing-technology-martech-important-executives-2019-10">a list of martech leaders to watch,</a> martech companies, advertising agencies, consultants and publishers will not be considered.</p>
      <p>We will aim to publish the list in mid December.</p>
      <p><b>Note: We require that companies share 2019 revenue numbers.</b> Check out our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-intriguing-adtech-martech-startups-2018-11">2018,</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hottest-independent-pre-acquisition-ad-tech-pre-ipo-companies-2017-7">2017</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-37-hottest-pre-ipo-ad-tech-companies-2016-5">2016</a> lists to see how we've reported financials in the past.</p>
      <p>In addition to nominations, we also use our own reporting and sources to determine the list.</p>
      <p>Again, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfOXWxaP5GcyuAaav_vpuyC6SA0v-6F41C8VzCBt7rtdzHb0g/viewform">click here to fill out</a> a nomination by November 22.</p>
