        <b>Gender Minister, Olivia Grange, has announced the start of a new programme to assist adolescent fathers to live up to their responsibilities.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Young Fathers Jamaica Initiative will be implemented by the Women’s Centre Foundation of Jamaica, which runs the Programme for Adolescent Mothers.</p>
      <p>Grange made the announcement in her message to mark International Men’s Day, which is being observed today.</p>
      <p>She indicated that the new initiative is designed to “assist adolescent fathers to become outstanding dads.”</p>
      <p>Grange also announced the start of the #MentorMe2020 programme which will target at-risk young men.</p>
      <p>According to Grange, #MentorMe2020 — to be led by the Bureau of Gender Affairs — will see “outstanding men helping high school boys to become outstanding and balanced men of the future.”</p>
      <p>International Men’s Day is being observed under the theme “Building Strong Men through Health and Wellness: Balance di ting”.</p>
      <p>Grange said her Ministry will be leading targeted interventions across the country to address some of the health and wellness issues facing men.</p>
      <p>“Everyday men across Jamaica make tremendous sacrifices for their families, our communities and our nation.  Today, we acknowledge all that you do for us and express our gratitude.</p>
      <p>“But we know that in your quest to ensure that the rest of us are okay, you oftentimes don’t pay enough attention to your own wellbeing; and that is why for this year’s celebration we focus on Building Strong Men through Health and Wellness to Balance di Ting.”</p>
