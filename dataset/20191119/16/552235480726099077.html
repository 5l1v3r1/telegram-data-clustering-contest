      <p>A fraudster is facing prison after attempting to smuggle 47,200 cigarettes through duty free.</p>
      <p>James Thomson, 68, avoided paying over £15,000 in tax on the duty-free fags when passing through Prestwick Airport.</p>
      <p>Thomson, of Kingsley Court, Uddingston, admitted being concerned in carrying the smokes in April 2018.</p>
      <p>The tax payable on the cigarettes was £15,426.93.</p>
      <p>Thomson’s wife Maureen, 64, and son Andrew, 42, also originally appeared on the charge but their not guilty pleas were accepted by the Crown.</p>
      <p>Depute fiscal Andrew Lazzarin said: “Once it was decided that Mr Thomson was maintaining his guilty plea, a plea from him would be an acceptable solution.”</p>
      <p>Defence solicitor Steven Maxwell told Sheriff Ross McFarlane that his client did not have any previous convictions.</p>
      <p>The sheriff said that, given the amount concerned, he would seek advice from the High Court.</p>
      <p>Sheriff McFarlane said: “This falls within the category of prison.</p>
      <p>“A report will be essential in my opinion.”</p>
      <p>The case was adjourned for social work reports and Thomson will reappear at a later date.</p>
