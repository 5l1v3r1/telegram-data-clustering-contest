      <p>And ahead of his biggest ever UK tour Sir Rod has been talking about some of the stories behind his greatest hits.</p>
      <p>Speaking in a video on his social media channels, Rod discussed You're in My Heart.</p>
      <p>He said: "There's a sad story attached to You're in My Heart because I wrote that the day Elvis died.</p>
      <p>"I was in Canada and we were just laying down the track and it was on the television in the studios.</p>

      <p>"So every time I think of that song when I wrote it Elvis crops up."</p>
      <p>Maggie May became Rod’s first big solo hit on both sides of the Atlantic, topping the UK charts for five weeks.</p>
      <p>But Rod revealed record label bosses didn’t rate it because of its lack of chorus.</p>
      <p>He added: "Maggie May, when it was first recorded, the drummer on the track Mickey Waller showed up without a drum kit.</p>
      <p>"It's unusual for a drummer.</p>
      <p>"So we had to run around all the other studios and borrow equipment.</p>
      <p>"There were no actual cymbals so when we did Maggie May we had to dub the cymbals on another day afterwards.</p>
      <p>"It's not a very professional way to go about it."</p>
