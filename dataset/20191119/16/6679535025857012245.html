      <p>Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, which started as an exclusive online seller, is planning to ramp up its offline retail presence to 50% across India by this year end, said a top official.</p>
      <p>“We have a clear focus of expanding our offline retail presence by the year end,” said B. Muralikrishnan, COO, Xiaomi India. We are planning to double the number of retail outlets from the present 10,000 to 20,000 in the near future.” Xiaomi ventured into the offline retail route in 2017.</p>
      <p>Asserting that offline retail accounted for one-third of mobile sales — both for Xiaomi and for the industry in general — and the rest online, he said: “Over the years, our offline sales has been growing by leaps and bounds. By the end of the year, it will probably be 50:50 [online vs offline].”</p>
