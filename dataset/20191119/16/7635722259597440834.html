      <p>Philip came to Dublin while still a young boy, and went on to become one of Ireland's most famous songwriters and musicians in a series of bands - including 'Thin Lizzy' - and as a solo artist.</p>
      <p>Philomena had a statue of Philip erected in Dublin city centre, just off Grafton Street, where it still stands.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year,<b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/post-launches-new-thin-lizzy-stamps-910903"> An Post announced </a></b>two new stamps to mark 50 years of 'Thin Lizzy'.</p>
      <p>The stamps are based on the iconic artwork of Jim Fitzpatrick and cover standard postage within the island of Ireland.</p>
      <p>Fitzpatrick is perhaps best known for his iconic two-tone portrait of Che Guevara created in 1968, based on a photo by Alberto Korda.</p>
      <p>One of the greatest bands to come out of Ireland, 'Thin Lizzy' remain giants of Irish rock decades after they first came together in 1969.</p>
