        <b>No approach has been made to Rafa Benitez about a possible return to the Premier League this season, <i>Sky Sports News</i> understands.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Benitez remains focused on making a success of his time in China but expects to manage in England again, possibly as soon as next season.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard, who earns Â£12m a year after tax as manager of Chinese Super League side Dalian Yifang, was linked with West Ham on Tuesday.</p>

            <b>Pellegrini worried by Hammers slump</b>
          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Hammers are without a win in six games and that run has placed intense pressure on manager Manuel Pellegrini, with his side sitting 16th in the table, five points above the bottom three.</p>
      <p>Benitez left Newcastle back in June to move to China but Dalian Yifang are stuck in the CSL's mid-table - ninth of 16 teams with three games remaining in their season.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old came close to joining West Ham as manager back in 2015 before he was hired by Real Madrid - that role would last only half a season.</p>
      <p>His family remain based in the North West and Benitez was recently quoted as saying he has "unfinished business" in the Premier League.</p>
