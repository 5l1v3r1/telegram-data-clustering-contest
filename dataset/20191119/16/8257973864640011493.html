      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- An Oregon family's cat was found more than 1,200 miles away in New Mexico after disappearing five years earlier.</p>
      <p>The Santa Fe Animal Shelter said black cat Sasha was identified via microchip after being found recently wandering the streets of the city.</p>
      <p>The microchip revealed Sasha's family lived more than 1,200 miles away in Portland.</p>
      <p>Viktor Usov, 31, said he was shocked to receive a call from the shelter telling him Sasha had been found.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't believe it," Usov said. "We thought the worst, but when we received the call, we were so thankful Sasha was alive and well."</p>
      <p>Usov said Sasha must have hitched a ride at some point after disappearing from the family's home five years earlier.</p>
      <p>He said the feline "was on a great American adventure."</p>
      <p>American Airlines has offered to fly Sasha home to Oregon.</p>
      <p>The shelter said the case highlights the importance of microchipping pets.</p>
      <p>"A simple microchip, which is the size of a grain of rice and is implanted under the pet's skin, helped us find the guardian of this missing cat," said Murad Kirdar, the shelter's public relations manager.</p>
