      <h1>Louis Saha sets record straight over pay-as-you-play Everton contract and relationship with David Moyes</h1>
      <h2>Louis Saha has lifted the lid on the real real behind his Everton exit in January 2012</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/adam-jones/" target="_blank">Adam Jones</a></address>
      <p>Louis Saha has opened up on his Everton exit and rumours of being on a pay-as-you-play deal when first joining the club.</p>
      <p>The striker completed a switch to Goodison park from Manchester United in the summer of 2008 for an undisclosed fee before going on to bag 35 goals in 115 appearances for the Blues.</p>
      <p>Many believed that, because the Frenchman was injured when he made the move to Merseyside, that he had agreed a pay-as-you-play deal to sign with <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a>.</p>
      <p>However, speaking to the latest FourFourTwo magazine, the now 41-year-old has revealed that wasn't the case.</p>
      <p>"I didn't, although I proposed that when I arrived at Everton," Saha revealed.</p>
      <p>"I was injured and because of my history at United I didn't want to go there, take a big salary and then not play. So I told them, 'Until I'm fit, I'm happy to just play for a certain amount'.</p>
      <p>"I proposed that and it ended up in the papers - I don't know how. It showed, though, that some footballers aren't focused on money but on trying to deliver what is fair."</p>
      <p>Saha spent three-and-a-half years at Goodison Park before completing a free transfer to Spurs in 2012's winter window, penning a six-month contract with the North London side.</p>

      <p>A few were surprised to see the striker leave Everton at that time, but the Frenchman has now revealed his thinking behind the move.</p>
      <p>"I felt that whatever connection I had with <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/david-moyes">David Moyes</a> had been lost,"Saha added.</p>
      <p>"I'm loyal - if you speak to me and have the right communication, I can accept everything. But when you don't speak to me and get the man management wrong, I'm like a kid - I'm just like, 'It's over'. That's what happened.</p>
      <p>"I had an injury. I broke my ankle, and came back into the club early.</p>
      <p>"I did all of pre-season on the bike to make sure that I'd be around the team, because they had younger players. I made a lot of effort to put my body on the line, but then I felt disrespected that he hadn't embraced what I'd done to come back.</p>
      <p>"Not long after I came back, he put me in the stand without any communication, and I didn't like that.</p>
      <p>"I had an argument with him, and once something like that happens, I act like a kid because I don't feel defended. I didn't feel protected by the players; that 'It's Louis, he's done this for the club'.</p>
      <p>"So I made the decision that I needed to go."</p>
      <p>One of the moments Everton fans will remember Saha for most, however, came in his first season with the club.</p>
      <p>The striker came off the bench in the FA Cup quarter final to eventually help his side to Wembley in May to face Chelsea, and bagged the opener in that match after just 25 seconds.</p>

      <p>It's still the fastest ever goal in an FA Cup final, but it doesn't mean anything to Saha.</p>
      <p>He claimed: "I felt gutted.</p>
      <p>"My desire to win a trophy with Everton was even bigger than it was at Man United, because ego talks. I though, 'If I come to this club, I want to deliver'.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't normal to win trophies at Everton. At United, you had Giggsy, Ronaldo - all those players - so if you don't win trophies, that's not normal.</p>
      <p>"It's really nice to be mentioned for every FA Cup final now, but scoring that goal in the opening minute doesn't mean anything to me.</p>
      <p>"It was an amazing feeling as I scored, though. I'd lost my uncle a few weeks beforehand and I felt very emotional going into that game, because I'd had an injury and managed to get into the squad.</p>
      <p>"It was unbelievable to score and I felt connected with the Everton fans, as I could hear all the noise from them. It was just too early!"</p>
