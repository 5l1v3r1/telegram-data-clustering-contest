      <p>A woman rescued a badly burnt and wailing koala from an Australian bushfire on Tuesday (November 19).</p>
      <p>The marsupial was spotted crossing a road amongst the flames near Long Flat in New South Wales.</p>
      <p>A local woman, who told Australia's Nine News her name was Toni, rushed to the koala's aid, wrapping the animal in her shirt and a blanket and pouring water over it.</p>
      <p>She said she would transport the injured koala to the nearby Port Macquarie Koala Hospital.</p>
      <p>The country's koala populations have been a major victim of the flames, with more than 350 of the marsupials feared killed in a major habitat.</p>
      <p>Population estimates for koalas, native to Australia, vary widely, from as few as 50,000 to little more than 100,000.</p>
      <p>They dwell mostly in eucalyptus forests in eastern states and on the coastal fringes, usually living up to 20 years, carrying their young in a pouch and sleeping for up to 18 hours a day.</p>
      <p>Australia is prone to bushfires in its dry, hot summers, but fierce blazes have been sparked early, in the southern spring, by a long drought and soaring temperatures.</p>
      <p>Bushfires have so far this month claimed at least four lives, burnt about 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of farmland and bush and destroyed more than 300 homes.</p>
      <p>The current bushfire crisis has mostly been contained to the east coast of NSW and Queensland states, but officials in South Australia warned on Tuesday that forecast near-record temperatures raises the risks in that state.</p>
