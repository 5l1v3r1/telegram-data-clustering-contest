      <p>Cox Communications is expanding its service at Wynn Las Vegas to include the company’s new convention center expansion.</p>
      <p>Cox and Wynn Resorts Ltd. on Tuesday announced that Cox Business would support the two-level 560,000-square-foot conference center addition that opens in February.</p>
      <p>Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
      <p>Cox Business currently serves Wynn and Encore and will nearly double the Cisco access points and Cisco Wireless Switches on the property.</p>
      <p>The addition, located just off Wynn’s recently reopened 18-hole golf course, adds 300,000 new rentable square feet across 57 flexible meeting rooms, a 20,000-square-foot outdoor pavilion with a 20,000-square-foot adjacent lawn and four pillarless ballrooms.</p>
