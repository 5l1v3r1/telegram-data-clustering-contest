      <p>Kumasi, Nov. 19, GNA â€“ A Kumasi Circuit Court has remanded a 29-year-old carpenter for allegedly, defiling a 11-year-old school girl.</p>
      <p>Kwadwo Norvo pleaded not guilty and would reappear before the court presided over by Miss Comfort Tasiame, on November 27, this year.</p>
      <p>Prosecuting, Police Chief Inspector Mercy Quaye, told the court that the complainant, Noami Dadzie, who is the mother of the victim, resides in the same house with the accused at Ahinsan, a suburb in Kumasi.</p>
      <p>She said in the month of April this year, on one evening, the victim returned from school and met the absence of her mother.</p>
      <p>The Prosecution said the accused who was then in his room sent the victim to buy him toilet tissue which she did and handed it over to him in his room.</p>
      <p>She said after receiving the tissue, Norvo gave his phone to the victim to play games with it.</p>
      <p>The Prosecution said in the course of the victim playing with the phone, the accused drew closer and ordered her to stand up.</p>
      <p>Madam Quaye said the accused then pushed her onto his bed, removed her panties and forcibly had sexual intercourse with her.</p>
      <p>Prosecution said, the accused warned the victim not to tell anyone else he will beat her.</p>
      <p>She said a few days later, the victim felt sick and was taken to hospital where it was discovered that she had been defiled.</p>
      <p>The Prosecution said during interrogation by the mother, she mentioned the accused as her the culprit.</p>
      <p>She said a complaint was made at Asokwa Divisional Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit (DOVVSU) and a Police medical report form was issued to send the victim to the hospital for examination and treatment.</p>
      <p>Chief Inspector Quaye said the complainant returned with the medical report form duly endorsed by a medical officer of Kumasi South Hospital.</p>
      <p>The accused was later arrested and detained to help in investigations.</p>
      <p>Police Chief Inspector Quaye said the accused was subsequently charged and brought before the Court.</p>
