      <p>Amazon today announced a new product in its Fire TV lineup. The new Amazon Fire TV Blaster is a companion device to existing Fire TV devices that will add Alexa voice control to your existing TV, soundbar, cable or satellite box, and receiver from brands like Samsung, Sony, LG, Vizio, Comcast, DISH, and DIRECTV/AT&amp;T U-verse, and more. Once the setup is done, you can use your voice to control power, volume, and playback and switch between inputs.</p>
      <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
      <blockquote>Similar to universal remotes, Fire TV Blaster uses infrared (IR) to help TVs, soundbars, satellite and cable boxes, and A/V receivers work together wirelessly.</blockquote>
      <p>Amazon Fire TV Blaster will require anyone of the following: Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote, Fire TV Stick 4K, or Fire TV (3rd Gen) and any Echo smart speaker or smart display.</p>
      <p>You can pre-order the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075F9PYGR/?tag=wmpowcom-20">Amazon Fire TV Blaster for $35 here.</a> You can also get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZK52TWQ/?tag=wmpowcom-20">Fire TV Blaster bundle with Fire TV Stick 4K and Echo Dot (3rd Gen) for $79.99.</a></p>
