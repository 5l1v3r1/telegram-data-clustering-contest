      <p><a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/gigimasin">Gigi Masin</a>'s new album, <i>Calypso</i>, was inspired by the Greek islands. <br/><br/>Calypso is the unofficial name for Gavdos, the southernmost Greek island, AKA Ogygia in ancient mythology. (In Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>, the nymph Calypso imprisoned Odysseus on Ogygia for seven years.) The 16-track ambient album is out February 28th via R&amp;S subsidiary <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/record-label.aspx?id=7758">Apollo</a>. <br/><br/>"Gavdos gives you profound sensations in every corner, as here you can find enchantment, mystery, the getting lost to forget, to erase and drown the memories in a light and salty water," says Masin. <br/><br/>On his production methods, he adds: "[<i>Calypso</i> was made using] the same old software, a simple, sort of a child-proof game from the mid-'90s or what experts call a 'beta.' It's a kind of mixer where you have to insert the music files as they are, naked and simply as recorded. But it works like I have six or eight tape recorders where my sounds are not locked, so my chance of giving them a perfect position isn't always certain. Often it seems the sound found its own way without human logic, and the music appears as a revelation." <br/><br/>Listen to the title track.</p>
