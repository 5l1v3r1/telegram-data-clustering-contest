      <h1>Review: Fast-rising R&amp;B and soul star Mahalia at Bristol's O2 Academy</h1>
      <h2>A joyful performer with a stunning voice</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:36:23+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:36</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Murray</a></address>
      <p>Mahalia kicks off her show at Bristol's O2 Academy on Monday night with two disclaimers.</p>
      <p>One being that she likes to talk a lot, the other that she is prone to burping after drinking water.</p>
      <p>While there aren't any audible belches throughout the performance, the 21-year-old definitely wasn't lying about the talking, with songs punctuated by lengthy epilogues on what inspired them and nuggets of advice for younger audience members.</p>
      <p>While some people in the crowd express frustration as she launches into yet another oration, keen to hear more music instead, they are very much the minority as the vast majority in the packed-out venue are hanging on every word.</p>
      <p>That's because whether talking or singing, the fast-rising R&amp;B and soul star is an infectious performer who genuinely looks like she loves what she's doing.</p>
      <p>After signing to Warner subsidiary Asylum Records at the tender age of 13, she has worked hard to get where she is now and is finally earning the kind of praise she deserves.</p>

      <p>Her debut LP, <i>Love and Compromise</i>, was a long time in the making but received glowing reviews, and it is tracks from it which stand out as highlights of the set.</p>
      <p>On <i>Simmer</i> she throws off her green coat to reveal a black leotard underneath which draws one of many deafening cheers from the crowd on the night, while <i>Sober</i> is preceded with a stripped-back vocal version which shows off the true brilliance of the Leicester-born's vocals, before ending with an adapted disco alternative which gets everyone moving.</p>
      <p>After telling female members of the crowd that they don't need to wear a bra if they don't want to, someone who clearly took her message fully to heart throws theirs onto the stage.</p>
      <p>Mahalia then temporarily wears it over her clothing before stating, 'That's the third bra I've been thrown on the tour so far and it's only the fourth night' - one of a handful of moments which highlights her sense of humour.</p>
      <p>The set finishes with the fantastic <i>I Wished I Missed My Ex</i>, her most well-known release to date, ensuring everyone leaves with a spring in their step - and there's also time in the encore for a mass singalong of happy birthday for a lucky 15-year-old in the front row.</p>
      <p>It's likely the youngster will remember that moment for a long time, but then again it was a memorable gig for everyone in attendance, not just the birthday girl.</p>
