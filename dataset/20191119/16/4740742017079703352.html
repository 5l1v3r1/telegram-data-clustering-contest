      <p>A number of Bristol University students based in Hong Kong have decided to fly home amid protests in the city.</p>
      <p>Pro-democracy campaigners have been using Hong Kong Polytechnic University as a base for demonstrations, which have included the throwing of petrol bombs.</p>
      <p>Tear gas and rubber bullets have been used against the protesters, who could face penalties of up to 10 years.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/university-of-bristol">University of Bristol </a>spokesperson revealed today (November 19) that six out of 15 students have already returned to their home country.</p>
      <p>Through a statement produced yesterday, a university spokesperson said: “Given the increase in the protests in recent days we have proactively offered to repatriate all our students.”</p>

      <p>The full statement reads: “Like many other UK universities, we do have a small number of students currently studying and living in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>“We have 15 students studying and working in four different universities in Hong Kong on placements, exchange or study abroad programmes.</p>
      <p>“We have stayed in close contact with them since they went to Hong Kong in September and have been monitoring the situation carefully.</p>
      <p>“Given the increase in the protests in recent days we have proactively offered to repatriate all our students.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to monitor security advice from our insurers and the FCO and will provide ongoing support to students if they wish to stay in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>“Flights are being booked for students who wish to return and staff will work with them to identify options for the rest of their year to ensure there is no detrimental impact on their studies as a result.</p>
      <p>“Our priority is to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all students and travelling staff.”</p>
