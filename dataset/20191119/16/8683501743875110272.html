      <p>The horror genre has been in a renaissance for the past few years, with many of the modern classics coming from Blumhouse Productions. The studio recently turned its focus on the classics, with reboots of <i>The Craft</i> and <i>Halloween</i>. The latter franchise has been entertaining for decades, and Blumhouse's 2018 sequel was a critical and box office success. Two more movies are heading down the pipeline, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483577/jamie-lee-curtis-shares-epic-halloween-kills-set-video-and-wow">starting with <i>Halloween Kills</i></a>. That sequel <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481899/halloween-kills-jamie-lee-curtis--looks-beat-up-as-laurie-returns">will reunite Jamie Lee Curtis</a> with original <i>Halloween</i> co-star Kyle Richards, who went on to become a TV personality. And Curtis is singing Richards' praises as she returns to acting.</p>
      <p>Kyle Richards played Lindsey Wallace in John Carpenter's <i>Halloween</i>, a little girl who was being babysat by Laurie. Lindsey survived her encounter with Michael thanks to Laurie's quick thinking. Kyle Richards went on to star in all nine season of <i>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i>. <i>Halloween Kills</i> marks Richards' return to acting, and Jamie Lee Curtis recently spoke to her upcoming performance, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>She is so great that it’s going to be so fun for her audience — who is now used to knowing her for her TV show. They are going to be so happy to see her be an actress again, and she is absolutely fantastic.</blockquote>
      <p>There you have it. Lindsey Wallace is finally returning to the <i>Halloween</i> franchise, with the OG star reprising her role. Kyle Richards hasn't been in a movie in a number of years, but it looks like she's bringing her A-game to <i>Halloween Kills</i>.</p>
      <p>Jamie Lee Curtis' comments to <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jamie-lee-curtis-raves-over-kyle-richards-work-in-halloween/">Us Magazine</a> shows how excited she is to reunite with her original <i>Halloween</i> co-star. Kyle Richards was just a kid when she starred as Lindsey Wallace, a little girl who is suddenly in grave danger once Michael Myers comes knocking. Now we'll meet an adult version of the character, and see how that trauma affected Lindsey later in life.</p>
      <p>It's already been teased that <i>Halloween Kills</i> <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480392/jamie-lee-curtis-says-halloween-kills-will-unpack-the-original-movie">will really unpack</a> the events of John Carpenter's 1978 original movie. Because while David Gordon Green's <i>Halloween</i> focused on Laurie Strode's psyche 40 years later, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483470/halloween-kills-set-photo-offers-first-glimpse-of-the-sequel">the upcoming sequel</a> will include more of the town of Haddonfield. Plenty of <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481993/halloween-kills-set-photo-confirms-the-return-of-one-original-actor">characters are returning</a>, so perhaps the survivors from Michael's previous attack will be brought together for their own protection. After all, The Shape didn't actually burn alive in Laure's basement.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In addition to Kyle Richards' Lindsey Wallace, <i>Halloween Kills</i> will also feature the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481272/halloween-kills-might-bring-back-yet-another-actor-from-the-original">return of a few other</a> original actors. Charles Cyphers will reprise his role as Leigh Brackett, the former sheriff and Annie's father. Additionally, Nancy Stephens will once again play Marion Chambers, Dr. Loomis' assistant. Finally, Anthony Michael Hall will be playing an adult version of Tommy Doyle, the other kid Laurie was babysitting that fateful Halloween night.</p>
      <p><i>Halloween Kills</i> will arrive in theaters on October 16th, 2020.
