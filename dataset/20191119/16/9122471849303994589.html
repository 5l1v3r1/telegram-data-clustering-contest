      <h1>ESPN’s First Take Apologizes For Showing This Colin Kaepernick Graphic</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:32:04+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>ESPN’s <i>First Take </i>apologized this morning for a Colin Kaepernick graphic displayed during Monday’s show, which discussed the quarterback’s NFL workout in Atlanta on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Worldwide Leader’s morning debate show displayed a “Dunce Kap?” graphic on the screen on Monday.</p>
      <p>ESPN host Molly Qerim apologized on behalf of the show this morning.</p>
      <p>“I’d like to deal with something that’s also very important,” Qerim said. “On yesterday’s First Take while discussing the issues around Colin Kaepernick’s workout on Saturday, we showed a graphic with the headline spelled ‘Kap? Dunce Kap?’ So we were wrong to use such a headline and I want to apologize for the entire First Take team. We’re embarrassed about it and that was poor judgment.”</p>
      <p>The graphic can be seen in the <i>First Take </i>clip below:</p>

      <p>For those unaware, the dictionary defines “dunce” as “a person who is slow at learning; a stupid person.”</p>
      <p>ESPN’s <i>First Take </i>has now made several headlines when it comes to the debate surrounding Kaepernick. Most notably, Stephen A. Smith <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/stephen-a-smith-fires-back-at-nfl-players-colin-kaepernick-comment">has been criticized by some and praised by others</a> for his strong stance on the subject.</p>
