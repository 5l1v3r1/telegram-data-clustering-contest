      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <p>Choice of three Cherry MX key-switch types. Nifty metal volume roller. Plush-feeling wrist rest. USB passthrough.</p>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <p>Very limited lighting configuration. No-software configuration of macros can get confusing. Expensive for the feature set.</p>
      <h4>Bottom Line</h4>
      <p>ADATA's XPG Summoner Cherry MX-based mechanical gaming keyboard offers a lot to like, but its clumsy customization and limited key lighting dull its elite-board luster.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>To make a field-leading <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/keyboards/8098/the-best-gaming-keyboards">gaming keyboard</a>, you have to do <i>everything</i> right. Typing comfort is a given, of course. Customizability, too: Serious players remap keys and create macros for specific games. And, the board should look good and make your life easier with extras like USB passthrough, dedicated shortcut keys, and media controls. XPG, the gaming division of Taiwanese component maker ADATA, comes so, <i>so</i> close to greatness with its newest mechanical gaming board, the $149.99 Summoner. It works well and has some useful premium features, but its no-software configuration is a few keystrokes behind the big dogs. For players with little desire to make macros or custom profiles, the Summoner can compete with some of the best. But the power users most likely to drop major coin on a keyboard will find it hard to...wait for it...summon up the enthusiasm, and the cash.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>A Choice of Cherry Switch</h3>
      <p>At first glance, the Summoner has all the things you want from a top-flight mechanical keyboard. It's a standard, full-size board with 104 keys. The frame measures 1.7 by 17.7 by 5.3 inches and features a luxe-looking aluminum top plate. The keys are backed by Cherry MX switches, so it has a reliably strong, comfortable feel for typing and playing games alike. ADATA/XPG offers three versions of the board, with a choice among Cherry MX key-switch types: Cherry MX Speed Silver (fast-response, shallow-trigger keys), Cherry MX Red (with a linear press and a light-touch feel), and Cherry MX Blue (classically clicky). Our test sample had the Cherry MX Blue switches, which behaved exactly as expected: copious, chattery feedback with a satisfyingly clicky feel.</p>

      <p>The Summoner also has a handful of features that I'd describe as nice touches, but tables stakes for a premium keyboard. The F10 to F12 keys double as media keys, which is par for the course with any middling keyboard, but the top-right corner has a dedicated mute button and a sturdy, chunky metal volume roller. And if you read enough of my reviews, you'll <i>know</i> that I'm a sucker for a good volume roller.</p>
      <p>A volume roller might seem a low-key feature, but using a roller like this is so much more convenient than turning the sound up or down at the bottom of a browser window or fumbling with the wire- or earcup-bound controls on a gaming headset. Also on the Summoner's chassis is a USB passthrough port, which is helpful if you plan to use a wired mouse.</p>

      <p>In a bit of a pleasant surprise, though, the Summoner's standout feature may be the wrist rest that comes with it. Made from black plastic and leatherette, it's one of the few in-box wrist rests I've run across that has enough padding to cradle your wrists properly. Not only do your hands fall into the proper position because the padding lifts them, but the wrist rest is genuinely comfortable enough to leave them in place for extended periods.</p>

      <p>Most bundled wrist rests are hard plastic, merely reducing strain by minimizing how steep the angle your wrists can hang off the edge of the keyboard. Not this one. It's a genuine value-add.</p>

      <h3>Configuring Macros: The Dark Art</h3>
      <p>Much of what I like about the XPG Summoner, alas, is undone by the fact that it doesn't feature any kind of PC-side configuration software for making macros or setting its multicolor lighting. I realize that some users prefer all-hardware, software-free configuration options, but I find keyboards that do not offer any software are often tricky to perfect. (I've also noticed that they tend to offer fewer options in the areas where software would help the most.)</p>
      <p>Such is the case with the Summoner, which offers the ability to create macros, assign them to one of five in-board profiles, and map them to almost any key. The process isn't complicated: Simply pick one of five color-coded profiles (you reach these via Fn and the F1 to F5 keys), press a key combination (Fn and right Alt) to start recording, record your macro, and then press the key combo again to end the recording. From then, you have 20 seconds to press a destination key for your macro.</p>
      <p>While the process isn't hard, it isn't ideal, either. Keyboards that have configuration apps let you visualize your button presses and timing, and many allow you to go in and edit the shortcut sequences after you're done. Plus, with the Summoner's approach, you must bind a macro to a key when you make it. For simple shortcuts, this will get the job done, but if you are creating custom macros to fit a specific game, it's more difficult than it needs to be to get things just right.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/672398-xpg-summoner-gaming-keyboard-numberpad.jpg?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>This highlights a larger issue around profiles and how you'll use them. Though it isn't hard to tell your profiles apart—they are color-coded, after all—it's on you to remember which profile is home to which macros, and where you intend to use them. Without software, you can't tie profiles to specific games. You also can't store profiles for later or create one, copy it, and tweak it in different ways to apply to similar games.</p>
      <p>In addition, the Summoner's RGB lighting configuration isn't complicated, but it feels very limited. First of all, to call it "RGB" at all (as the box does) is stretching things quite a bit. As I mentioned, each of the keyboard's profiles is color-coded; you get profiles dubbed Blue, Indigo, White, Green, and Yellow. Other than Red, the default lighting color, those are the only colors the keyboard offers. By comparison, some gaming keyboards from reliable brands at not much more than half the MSRP offer the full 16.8-million-color RGB spectrum. In addition to the six static colors, the Summoner can dial up a handful of basic multi-color patterns (the usual color-wave and breathing effects among them), but that's it. This is the level of customization I would expect from a budget keyboard, not one with a $150 list price.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Great Keyboards Are Built, Not Summoned</h3>
      <p>The XPG Summoner is a solid keyboard in many respects, but it falls far short in a few. Those issues shouldn't disqualify it outright, though, if you're in the market for a new keyboard, especially if you aren't the type of player to make macros or to fidget to the nth degree with your lighting. Its most practical features—the USB passthrough, the wrist rest, the volume roller—are more practical and wide-reaching than the ones that are lacking.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>That said, the Summoner would look a whole lot more magical with a drop in price. At this writing, you could get many of the keyboards on our <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/keyboards/8098/the-best-gaming-keyboards">best gaming keyboards</a> list (take for one, the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/hyperx-alloy-origins/123046/hyperx-alloy-origins">HyperX Alloy Origins</a>) for about $150 or quite a bit less, not to mention a few other well-rounded runners-up, such as the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/razer-huntsman-tournament-edition/122602/razer-huntsman-tournament-edition">Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition</a>. Just play the e-tailer sales game right, and perhaps pull the trigger if and when the price settles closer to $100. The XPG Summoner gives off strong elite-keyboard vibes, but when pitted against the best that keyboard stalwarts such as Corsair, Logitech, and Razer can drum up, at $149.99 its spell is mostly an illusion.</p>
