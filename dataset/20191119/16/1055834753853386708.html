      <p>Nintendo is seeing continued success here in the UK with its Switch platform and it shows no sign of slowing down or stagnating. Games Industry is reporting that Nintendo’s latest platform is currently the best-selling console of the year so far and if Sony doesn’t have any outstanding deals on hardware during Black Friday it could easily finish 2019 in first. Nintendo has sold 90,000 Switch consoles this month alone, which is very impressive, and sales have naturally spiked with the latest entry in the Pokemon franchise being released, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/?s=Pokemon+Sword+%26+Shield">Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield</a>. With Sony’s PlayStation 4 soon to enter its final year, the Nintendo Switch could take next year too with Sony’s PlayStation 5 not expected until Christmas 2020. After that we shall have to wait and see what happens.</p>
