      <h1>These Samsung SSDs are available for cheap right now</h1>

      <p>Not one to wait around for Black Friday proper, Amazon has already reduced a whole range of Samsung SSDs to their lowest ever prices.</p>
      <p>Your SSD choices are slightly different in the US or the UK, but there are similarities across both regions.</p>
      <p>Whichever side of the Pacific you’re on, you can plump for the Samsung 860 EVO deal. Both the 1TB and 2TB versions are on sale at Amazon US, but in the UK you’ll just have to make do with the smaller one for now. Or, there’s the mightily expensive 860 QVO.</p>
      <p>Still, as far as PC upgrades go, an SSD drive is about as quick and efficient as they get.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you’re after something even quicker, you can go for one of the Samsung 970 EVO SSDs. These NVMe M.2 internal drives are slightly more expensive a little more fiddly to install but do benefit from faster read/write speeds.</p>
