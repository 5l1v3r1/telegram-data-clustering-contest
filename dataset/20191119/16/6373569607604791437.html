      <h1>Marine E reveals his identity and suicide attempt</h1>
      <h2>Sam Deen was previously known as 'Marine E'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:11:08+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>A former marine who was accused of the murder of a Taliban fighter has revealed his identity and spoken of a suicide attempt.</p>
      <p>Sam Deen, who until now was known as 'Marine E', admitted he offered to shoot the wounded insurgent before he was eventually killed by Sgt Alexander Blackman in Afghanistan in 2011, the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50225045">BBC</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Charges against Mr Deen were later dropped, and an anonymity order has now been lifted, allowing him to reveal how the prosecution left him contemplating suicide.</p>
      <p>Speaking on BBC show Victorian Derbyshire, he said: ""I didn't feel like I did anything wrong.</p>
      <p>"He was going to die anyway. He was probably already dead."</p>

      <p>At the time, he admitted telling comrades: " "Let's just put one in his head, let's just do it.</p>
      <p>"I said, 'I'll shoot him'.</p>
      <p>"We were like, 'What are we doing here? Let's just get out of here'.</p>
      <p>"I was trying to influence it in a way to try and hurry up and get things done - and fit in as well."</p>
      <p>Speaking about after the Taliban fighter had been shot, he said, "It was like, 'Right that's done, let's just go'.</p>
      <p>"It had to be that way. He was going to die anyway."</p>
      <p>Mr Deen said he was in Gibraltar - in October 2012 - when he first heard he was to be charged by British police.</p>

        <figcaption>Mr Deen tried to kill himself after hitting 'rock bottom' when he left the Royal Marines</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"I was like... 'How can you charge me with full-on murder when I didn't kill anyone?'</p>
      <p>"The whole situation was used as a scapegoat for the military. They had to be seen to be doing something.</p>
      <p>"If they were going to do that, they should bring up thousands of cases in every single war."</p>
      <p>Four months later charges against Mr Deen were dropped. He left the Royal Marines in 2015.</p>
      <p>It was then, he said, that his mental health suffered.</p>

      <p>"I left the blanket of the military, the cover of protection, and then you're just a civilian now.</p>
      <p>"I just totally went off the rails... hit rock bottom in my mind, in my brain."</p>
      <p>He tried to kill himself last year after having panic attacks.</p>
      <p>"I was having panic attacks. I just thought, 'I don't want to live like this anymore'. I tried to take an overdose.</p>
      <p>"You go from being a Royal Marine in control, knowing what he's doing in life, to then leaving and losing control."</p>
