      <h1>Plans for seven-bedroom home in bay withdrawn</h1>
      <h2>PLANS to build a seven-bedroom eco-house with adjoining one-bedroom apartment above Portelet Bay have been withdrawn.</h2>

      <p>DT Holdings (Jersey) Ltd had planned to build the two-storey structure on the site of an existing 1970s bungalow called St Albans.</p>
      <p>The application featured an indoor swimming pool with a steam room and sauna, cinema and wine cellar.</p>
      <p>The plans were criticised by a number of nearby residents and the chief executive of the National Trust for Jersey, Charles Alluto, who claimed that the proposed building would be contrary to both the Island Plan and planning laws.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, residents living in the ‘Portelet Bay’ apartments instructed MS Planning, an architecture firm, to write a letter to planners citing their objections.</p>
      <p>These included a lack of parking for contractors and that there would be an increase in occupancy on the site – contrary to the planning policies.</p>
      <p>Mr Alluto – who is spearheading a petition for more protection of the Island’s coastline from development – said he was ‘absolutely delighted’.</p>
      <p>‘I think the proposal could have had significant detrimental impact on the coastal landscape and added to what is already an overdeveloped area,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘I am glad that the developers are going back and reviewing their plans and hopefully coming up with something more sensitive.</p>
      <p>‘In our experience, there is likely to be another application submitted but I hope they will take greater consideration of the policies in place to protect our coastline.’</p>
      <p>Asked why he thought the application had been withdrawn, Mr Alluto said: ‘It was difficult to see how it would be consistent with Island Plan policy. I think they have probably recognised that it would be unlikely that they would be granted consent.</p>
      <p>‘But a significant number of people objected to the development who wanted a more sensitive design, and that could have had an impact too.’</p>
