      <p>Matthew Ochei, Asaba</p>
      <p>The Delta State Government has revealed plans to immunise 5,000 dogs against rabies and ensure the elimination of the disease in the state</p>
      <p>The Commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources Delta State, Mr Julius Egbede, stated this on Monday while inaugurating the state’s yearly free immunization programme against rabies in dogs and cats in Asaba.</p>
      <p>He said Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has made funds available for various veterinary public health activities which includes prevention of animal diseases like rabies in dogs, African swine fever in pigs, avian influenza in birds and pest and petite ruminants in goats.</p>
      <p>According to him, “Most of these diseases are endemic in Nigeria with outbreaks recording up to 100 per cent mortality once contracted.</p>
      <p>“Rabies is a contagious and highly fatal zoonotic disease of dogs, cats, man and other animals which can be contracted through the bite and saliva of an infected dog or certain species of wild bat.</p>
      <p>“Our target this year is to vaccinate over 5,000 dogs across the state against rabies; as of last year, we have been able to immunise 3, 620 dogs but we are targeting a higher number as the year go on with a view to eliminating the disease.</p>
      <p>“So, I want to use this opportunity to call on all dog and cat owners to take advantage of this free immunisation to keep their pets free from rabies and ensure the elimination of the disease in the state,” he said.</p>
      <p>The free vaccination which commenced on Monday will end on November 30 across the state.</p>
