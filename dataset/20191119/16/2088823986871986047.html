      <p><b>Matchup: <a href="https://www.nhl.com/sabres/stats/">Buffalo Sabres</a></b> (10-7-3) vs. <b><a href="https://www.nhl.com/wild/stats">Minnesota Wild</a> </b>(7-11-2)<br/><b>Where</b>: KeyBank Center<br/><b>When:</b> 7 p.m<br/><b>TV:</b> MSG<br/><b>Radio:</b> WGR 550</p>
      <p><b>An 11-7 day:</b> Not since Lindy Ruff was their coach have the Sabres fielded the kind of lineup they will run on to the ice tonight against the Minnesota Wild, the NHL's worst team.</p>
      <p>With injuries battering their forwards, the Sabres opted against calling up yet another forward from Rochester and will instead dress only 11 forwards and seven defensemen. John Gilmour gets the call to transition up front – for what he said will be the first time since midget hockey in Montreal.</p>
      <p>"I'm really excited. It's an opportunity to step in the lineup and help the team win," Gilmour said. "And I think with my skating I can get up ice and backcheck well and hopefully help the team win."</p>
      <p>"John’s been amazing in the way he’s dealt with being the extra defenseman," said coach Ralph Krueger. "When he came in, he played really well. We’re pleased to find another opportunity for him in the lineup. He’s an energy player, he’s a good skater. We’re all so confident that he can help us out on the wing."</p>
      <p>Ruff used Nathan Paetsch at both forward and defense, and also had brief stints with Andrej Sekera and the late Steve Montador up front as well.</p>
      <p>Gilmour has played in just three of the Sabres' first 20 games, and is yet to collect a point. But he said transitioning to a different position won't be the challenge you might think.</p>
      <p>"Honestly I love the day to day here, whether I'm practicing or doing the extra work on game day when I'm not playing," he said. "I don't mind doing that at all. Watching the game from above, I'm learning things every day here. Especially being around this NHL club, it's just a great experience."</p>
      <p><b>The lines and pairs:</b> Based on practice Monday and the Gilmour announcement today, the Sabres should look like this:</p>
      <p>Olofsson-Eichel-Reinhart<br/>Skinner-Rodrigues-Sheary<br/>Vesey-Mittelstadt-Lazar<br/>Girgensons-Asplund-Gilmour<br/>----<br/>McCabe-Ristolainen<br/>Dahlin-Montour<br/>Jokiharju-Miller<br/>Scratch: Scandella</p>
      <p><b>Injury update:</b> Krueger said the Sabres didn't make another call-up because they're confident of getting a forward back Thursday in Boston. Marcus Johansson and Johan Larsson are both listed as day to day and would be the candidates.</p>
      <p><b>Special teams slumps:</b> The Sabres have slipped to 11th in the NHL on the power play and 26th on the penalty kill. Buffalo is 0 for 18 on the power play over the last seven games and 2 for 34 in the last 12 games. Things are no better on the PK, where the Sabres have allowed at least one power-play goal for five straight games and are just 11 for 18 in that stretch.</p>
      <p><b>In the nets:</b> The Sabres will go with Linus Ullmark (4-3-1, 2.98/.915), who is 3-0, 2.59/.930 in his career against Minnesota. Ullmark is 3-2 in his last five starts and pretty much on his season numbers over that stretch at 2.81/.915. He's been far outplaying Carter Hutton of late, as Hutton's last six starts have resulted in 0-4-2, 3.84/.876.</p>
      <p><b>Wild update</b>: Minnesota (7-11-2) is 6-5-2 in its last 13 games but has been chasing the season since opening it 0-4 and 1-6. The Wild is just 3-10 on the road and this will be their NHL-high 14th game away from XCel Energy Center. A major issue? The Wild is 0-6-1 within the Central Division. The goaltender is backup Alex Stalock (3-3, 2.85/.903) as starter Devan Dubnyk continues to struggle (3.36/.893)</p>
