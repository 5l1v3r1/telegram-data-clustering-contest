      <p>Longtime CNN legal analyst <a href="http://twitter.com/JeffreyToobin">Jeffrey Toobin</a> scored what may be the line of the day, and it's early.</p>
      <p>That sound you hear in the backgroud of the impeachment hearings is "Republican talking points disintegrating,‚Äù said Toobin midday on CNN.</p>
      <p>In the clip, Toobin points out that just today we have learned about:</p>
      <p>-- Donald Trump's own role in the July 25 phone call</p>
      <p>-- Ukraine knew the U.S. aid was conditional by July 10 meeting</p>
      <p>-- That the 'Javelins' aid to Ukraine was finally released only because the Trump administration was busted.</p>
      <p>Here's the video clip, from CNN's @<a href="https://twitter.com/zbyronwolf/status/1196826547585458176">zbyronwolf</a> (who writes CNN's very good #impeachment email newsletter).</p>
