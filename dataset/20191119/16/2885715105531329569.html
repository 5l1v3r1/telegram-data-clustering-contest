      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:39:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/education-desk/" target="_blank">Education Desk</a></address>
      <p>The Kerala Students Union (KSU), student outfit of the Congress in Kerala, called for a state-wide education bandh on Wednesday, protesting the police action on its members and an MLA near the Secretariat in Thiruvananthapuram.</p>
      <p>The KSU had undertaken a protest march to the Secretariat against alleged interference of higher education minister KT Jaleel in the row involving granting of moderation marks to students in examinations of the University of Kerala. A probe by the university had found that hundreds of students who appeared in examinations between 2016 and 2019 benefited from moderation marks granted by teachers. The Opposition led by the Congress has repeatedly raised the issue in the last few days in the Assembly, grilling the minister.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, when KSU members led by state president KM Abhijith and Palakkad MLA Shafi Parambil marched to the gates of the Secretariat, they were blocked by the police. KSU members allege that even though their march was peaceful, police hit them with batons and water-cannons with an intention to create violence. In the clashes, MLA Shafi Parambil was injured in the head, following which he was taken to the hospital for immediate medical aid. The MLA later told reporters that he had taken part in the march to ensure no violence took place and had appealed to the police not to engage in violence.</p>
      <p>When Opposition MLAs raised the issue in the Assembly, Minister AK Balan said he would investigate the attack on the MLA. The Opposition MLAs later walked out of the Assembly.</p>
