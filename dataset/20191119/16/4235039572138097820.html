      <p>This autumn the temperatures in Sofia won’t fall below 0. This happens once every 20 years, climate scientist Prof. Georgi Rachev told BNT.</p>
      <p>"September, October, November were not only warmer but also the temperatures won’t fall below 0," adding that: "We postponed the <b>flu</b> by one month because of the warm and dry weather."</p>
      <p>According to him, temperatures in the Balkans are 5 to 7 degrees Celsius warmer in November, which is "much for the Balkans and for Eastern Europe".  </p>
      <p>Usually <b>warm weather</b> mixes with air pollution but these are two big different topics and are used for economic and political purposes, Prof. Rachev emphasized.</p>
