      <p>Benjamin Kidd was seen stepping out of a Toyota Aygo and attacking the victim with a sharp weapon.</p>
      <p>The court heard that the man was purchasing drugs from Kidd when he was attacked for "short changing" him.</p>
      <p>The victim sustained serious injuries including a severed finger and cuts to his arm, head and back.</p>
      <p>His finger was not able to be reattached following the attack at about 8.20pm on May 19, on Burwaye Close, in Lichfield,</p>
      <p>Police located the vehicle and searched the adjacent property, where they found Kidd hiding in the loft space behind a water tank.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old, of Birch Avenue, Cannock, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm and was jailed at Stafford Crown Court on Monday.</p>
      <p>Detective Constable Gareth Morris said: “We are pleased with the sentence given.</p>
      <p>"This was a violent attack where the victim suffered serious life changing injuries and this behaviour will not be tolerated in Staffordshire.”</p>
