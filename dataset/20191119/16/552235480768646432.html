      <h1>Perthshire's Black Watch connections kept alive</h1>
      <h2>World War II communities reunited</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:38:33+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:38</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Clark, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/rachel-clark/</a></address>
      <p>Two small communities who supported each other during World War II have been reunited.</p>
      <p>Scone’s Laura Raimondi’s mother Eleonora Celentaro Grassi and her mother Giovanna Vigile looked after Black Watch soldiers when they were stationed in Trecastagni, a village at the foot of Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>
      <p>Having been inspired by her mother and grandmother’s efforts during the war, Laura was keen to keep that legacy and connection between Scone and Trecastagni alive.</p>
      <p>She invited the team from the Black Watch Castle and Museum in Perth to her restaurant La Sicilyana in Scone for coffee and cake to share the story with them.</p>
      <p>The team from the museum also brought along some objects from their collection relating to the regiment’s time in Sicily.</p>
      <p>Laura said: “It was a great delight to meet members of the Black Watch Castle and Museum and be able to share my story with them.</p>
      <p>“My mother often talked to us about the friendship with the Scottish soldiers.</p>
      <p>“She was only 10 in 1943, but even in her later days, she remembered playing her piano to entertain them, while my grandmother would offer some refreshments to these brave men.</p>
      <p>“The day they left, a battalion handkerchief was gifted to her, but unfortunately over the years it got lost.</p>
      <p>“What is incredible is that I am now living in Scone, just a few miles from the Black Watch Castle and Museum and have opened a Sicilian bistro.</p>
      <p>“I know my mother and grandmother would be delighted that I love to take care of our customers in our ‘little Sicily’ because we offer hospitality from the heart.</p>
      <p>“I am also very grateful to the Black Watch Castle and Museum to give me the opportunity to talk about my story.”</p>
      <p>According to an account from the 51st Highland Division, ‘C’ company of the 7th Black Watch got on the correct beach at the landings on Sicily on July 10, 1943, but the rest of the battalion landed in the wrong place.</p>
      <p>The 1st Black Watch (the reserve battalion) landed without opposition.</p>
      <p>And the 1st Gordon’s Group objectives were Capo Passero island and the village of Portopola, a tunny factory, light house and a ridge.</p>
      <p>Despite a couple of problems, all the other landings were successful and 154 Brigade established the bridgehead.</p>
      <p>The entry into the account finished: “The advance north now began.”</p>
      <p>Anne Kinnes, CEO at the Black Watch Castle and Museum, said: “We were absolutely delighted to meet with Laura and her husband and share in her family’s connection with the Black Watch.</p>
      <p>“We felt especially privileged to be able to bring along objects from our collection relating to the regiment’s time in Sicily, including a handkerchief that may have resembled the one given to her mother all those years ago.”</p>
