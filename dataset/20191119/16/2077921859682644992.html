      <h1>Leaked Emails Show Stephen Miller Helped Tank Marco Rubio's Campaign in 2016</h1>

      <p>To the extent that stories planted on <i>Breitbart</i> can influence a presidential campaign—and sadly, evidence suggests that the influence is far more than we’d like believe—Stephen Miller helped submarine Marco Rubio’s chances for the presidency in 2016. From <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/stephen-miller-planted-anti-rubio-stories-breitbart-during-2016-campaign-n1085451">NBC News</a>:</p>
      <p>The emails, which were first given to the Southern Poverty Law Center by former Breitbart writer Katie McHugh, reveal that Breitbart published an article in October 2015 about immigration levels with the byline “Breitbart News” under the direction of Miller while he was working for then-Sen. Jeff Sessions.</p>
      <p>Miller took steps to make sure his involvement—and by extension Sessions’—were hidden:</p>
      <p>“Also how should we run this? Under Senator Sessions’ byline? Or under ‘Breitbart News’ byline?” Boyle asked in a reply.</p>
      <p>Miller responded that the chart and the accompanying article should be run under a Breitbart News byline, in effect disguising his involvement.</p>
      <p>You won’t be surprised to know that most of Miller’s contributions fell in the arena of anti-immigration “news.” He became infamous later for crafting Trump’s child separation policy, and even at the time he was exercising a heavy hand in influencing the outlet’s coverage. His targeting of Rubio seems to be based almost entirely on the belief that Rubio was just slightly less stringent on immigration than most other Republicans.</p>
      <p>When asked for a statement, the White House decided to go with the line that any criticism of Miller was anti-Semitic. No, seriously:</p>
      <p>“Mr. Miller condemns racism and bigotry in all forms, but what deeply concerns me is how so many on the left are allowed to spread vile anti-Semitism and consistently attack proud Jewish members of this administration,” Gidley said in an emailed statement.</p>
      <p>More than 80 members of Congress have demanded that Miller resign.</p>
