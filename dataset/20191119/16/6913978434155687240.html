      <p><b>Saudi Gazette report<br/><br/>RIYADH —</b> Neom Co. took its first step toward developing young talents from the local community in the area where it plans to create a leading global destination in providing a healthy, clean, sustainable, and technology-enabled living.<br/><br/>Six female and nine male students were chosen to launch the program, which aims at enrolling a total of 250 students over the next coming five years in leading universities worldwide. The first phase of the program to develop their skills in the fields of tourism, hospitality and archeology in academic institutions in the US. Other disciplines will be added as the project progresses.<br/><br/>The objective of NEOM’s scholarship program initial stages is to develop skills from within the local community and involve them in the development of the project. The students who received the scholarships will be provided with suitable job opportunities with NEOM.<br/><br/>After meeting with the pioneer students, CEO Nadhmi Al-Nasr said: “Investing in human resources is a key building block for the success of NEOM and the developing young female and male talent from the local community is the best starting point.” This is our first step in a long journey to attract the best talents and minds to build the land of the future in NEOM, Al-Nasr added.<br/><br/>More than 300 students applied for the first phase of the scholarship program. From them 15 were offered sponsorship to study for bachelor’s degrees. The students will travel to the United States in January, where their education journey will begin, after a two-month foundation course in English language, in partnership with the University of Tabuk. NEOM will provide financial and administrative support to them while the Institute of International Education (IIE) will oversee their studies and academic provisions.</p>
