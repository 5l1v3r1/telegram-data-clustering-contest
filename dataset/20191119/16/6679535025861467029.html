      <h2>Members express anguish at abrupt adjournment of the Rajya Sabha</h2>

      <p>The Opposition expressed anguish at the abrupt adjournment of the Rajya Sabha within seven minutes of convening on Tuesday and accused the government of running away from answering their questions.</p>
      <p>The Upper House proceedings adjourned after Opposition uproar over alleged police action on protesting JNU students and detention of political leaders in Jammu and Kashmir. Soon after the House met for the day, the Left and other Opposition party members raised the two issues.</p>
      <p>Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu said the adjournment notices received from members do not warrant setting aside the listed business of the day.</p>
      <p>Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien pointed out that not a single member of the Opposition went into the well, yet within minutes the House was adjourned.</p>
      <p>“The government had four good reasons to do so. The first four questions listed today to be answered by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman were on hoarding notes after demonetisation, PMC bank fraud, public sector banks fraud and PSU disinvestment. You run away when you don’t have answers to any of the questions,” he said. The Opposition was deprived of their time in the House, he said.</p>
      <p>Members including Ghulam Nabi Azad and Anand Sharma (Congress), TK Rangarajan of the CPI(M), Sharad Pawar (NCP), Ramgopal Yadav (SP), Sukhendu Sekhar Roy (TMC) and Sanjay Singh (AAP) attended the meeting.</p>
      <p>The Opposition members told the Chairman, according to sources, that the Question Hour is becoming a casualty of such extended adjournments. The Chairman in reply said he doesn’t want the country to see such scenes the very next day, and asked members to see that the House is allowed to function normally so that they can discuss any issue, according to sources.</p>
      <p>RJD MP Manoj Jha pointed out that between 1952 to 1957 there was virtually no Opposition against then PM Jawaharlal Nehru and yet the Opposition got its say.</p>
      <p>“In the 250th session of Rajya Sabha even with contentious issues we should have an approach of resolution. This nation has solved many crisis only through dialogues. We should be prepared to take along diverse opinion,” Mr. Jha said.</p>
