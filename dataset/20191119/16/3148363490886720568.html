      <h1>WATCH: House Democrat Threatens NFL's Anti-Trust Exemption over Treatment of Kaepernick</h1>
      <h2>The chorus of outrage over Colin Kaepernick’s aborted workout at an NFL organized event last weekend, has now reached the halls of Congress.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:12:11+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:12</time> by <a rel="author">Dylan Gwinn</a></address>
      <p>Representative Hank Johnson (D-GA) not only expressed outrage at the NFL over the workout flap, he also made not-so-veiled threats about retaliating by going after the league’s anti-trust exemption.</p>
      <p>Johnson called Kaepernick a “victim,” and said the NFL was persecuting him for exercising his “1st Amendment Rights.”</p>
      <p>“It’s possible that Congress can do something,” Johnson <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/19/hank-johnson-nfl-congress-anti-trust-exemption-colin-kaepernick/">explained</a> to TMZ Sports. “Congress oversees the anti-trust exemption that we gave the NFL. The NFL is doing quite well with that anti-trust exemption, maybe it’s time for us to take a fresh look at it.”</p>
      <p>The anti-trust exemption dates back to the Kennedy Administration, when the federal government gave sports league’s a special immunity which allowed teams to function together as a monopoly.</p>

      <p>If the league were to lose its anti-trust exemption, the result could be a loss of billions.<br/>However, such a move would require widespread congressional support and it’s unlikely that Johnson’s anti-NFL sentiments are widely shared.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick ditched an NFL organized workout in front of scouts and representatives from 25 teams, after a disagreement over media availability and liability waivers. Instead, the former 49er and original anthem protester opted to hold a workout at a local Atlanta high school, in front of seven or eight teams.</p>
      <p>There is no word as of this writing, as to whether any of the teams who watched Kaepernick have a desire to sign him.</p>
