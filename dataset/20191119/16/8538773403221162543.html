      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1975/carmelo-anthony">Carmelo Anthony</a> has been activated by the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers">Portland Trail Blazers</a> and is expected to play in Tuesday night's game against the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans">New Orleans Pelicans</a>.</p>
      <p>Anthony is expected to play 20 minutes, a source tells ESPN's Marc Spears.</p>
      <p>Anthony, 35, will wear jersey No. 00. The 10-time All-Star has not played since Nov. 8, 2018, with the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets">Houston Rockets</a>.</p>
      <p>"Carmelo is an established star in this league that will provide a respected presence in our locker room and a skill set at a position of need on the floor," Blazers president Neil Olshey said.</p>
      <p>Anthony will have a base salary of $2.159 million.</p>
      <p>The contract will become fully guaranteed if Anthony is not waived by 5 p.m. on Jan. 7.</p>

      <p>Speaking on his YouTube channel Monday night, Anthony said, "The last year and a half has been an emotional roller coaster.</p>
      <p>"I've always kept my eye on Portland. It just didn't work out other times, but now it seems like it's a perfect opportunity."</p>
      <p>Anthony said he got the call from the Blazers on Wednesday and committed on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"Me and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6606/damian-lillard">Dame [Lillard],</a> we've been talking for the past couple years ... off and on," he said. "Me and<a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2490149/cj-mccollum"> CJ [McCollum]</a> have been playing in my Black Ops runs for the past four years.</p>
      <p>"I just look at the opportunity and say, 'This is what I can bring to the team. This is where I can help.' It will only work if all parties see it the same way."</p>
      <p>Anthony has career averages of 24.0 points, 6.5 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.02 steals in 1,064 games over 16 seasons with the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/den/denver-nuggets">Denver Nuggets</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks">New York Knicks</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> and Houston.</p>
      <p>Among active players with at least 200 games played, Anthony ranks fourth in career points per game, and he has the second-most career points among active players, trailing only <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james">LeBron James</a>.</p>
      <p>Power forward was the position where the Blazers were most vulnerable, and a shoulder injury to <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066650/zach-collins">Zach Collins</a> amplified the void there.</p>
      <p>Anthony could fit in well with the Blazers, who have struggled to get production from their forwards this season.</p>
      <p>Anthony hasn't played since a 10-game run with the Rockets that ended early in the 2018-19 season.</p>
      <p>"What happened before is the past," Anthony said. "I can't dwell on that. I learned from that. This happened at a point and time in my life where I do have a lot of clarity and understanding of different situations and just life, and my approach is totally different."</p>
