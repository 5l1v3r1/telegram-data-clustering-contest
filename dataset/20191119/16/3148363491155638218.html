      <h1>Report: Trump Campaign Considering Buying a Super Bowl Ad | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>President Trump has made the attending of sporting events a centerpiece of his re-election efforts. Now, according to a new report, he’s ready to increase his profile on the broadcast of sporting events as well.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:48:29+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:48</time> by <a rel="author">Dylan Gwinn</a></address>
      <p>The Trump campaign will make a historic ad buy during this year’s Super Bowl, <i>Sports Business Journal</i> <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Member/Login.aspx?redirectPath=/SB-Blogs/Newsletter-Media/2019/11/18.aspx">reports</a>.</p>
      <p>“The prospective <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/donald-trump-super-bowl-ad-campaign/3ns41nar9crm158m7k2dptygf">deal</a> for the Fox TV broadcast, which would be orchestrated by his 2020 re-election campaign, could cost in the neighborhood of $5.6 million for 30 seconds of airtime. That would likely <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-campaign-ads/#candidate=donald-trump">exceed the cost of any other campaign ad he has purchased</a> so far, though he reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/betsy_klein/status/1189720957415575552?s=20">paid seven figures for a World Series ad last month</a>.”</p>

      <p>The Trump campaign has not yet signed an official deal for the ad buy.</p>
      <p>President Trump first increased his visibility at sporting events last month, when he attended Game 5 of the World Series between the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros. The president also <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/04/washington-nationals-celebrate-world-series-championship-at-white-house/">treated</a> the victorious Nats to a White House ceremony to celebrate their win after Game 7.</p>
      <p>In addition, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to attend a UFC fight when he <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2019/11/02/cheers-and-boos-for-trump-at-ufc-244-bmf/">traveled</a> to Madison Square Garden for UFC 244. Trump also made the trip to Tuscaloosa earlier this month to <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2019/11/09/watch-president-trump-greeted-by-loud-cheers-at-bama-lsu-game/">see</a> the Alabama Crimson Tide take on the LSU Tigers.</p>
