        <b>Stephen Kenny's Ireland Under-21s have received a huge boost ahead of their clash with Sweden tonight as Troy Parrott has returned to the squad.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Parrott made his senior debut in the 3-1 victory over New Zealand last week but he was an unused substitute for the <a href="https://cms.buzz.ie/sport/player-ratings-as-ireland-fall-just-short-against-denmark-343551"><i>1-1 draw with Denmark</i></a> last night.</p>
      <p>This means he's fresh for the crunch clash against Sweden tonight.</p>
      <p>Parrott, 17, has scored three goals in three games at Under-21 level.</p>
      <p>Two of those goals came in the 3-1 win over tonight's opponents back in September.</p>
      <p>Lee O'Connor had already rejoined the squad after making his senior debut against New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Ireland's clash with Sweden kicks off at 8pm at Tallaght Stadium, with Kenny's side top of Group 1.</p>
      <p>However, they've played two more games than second-placed Italy who are three points behind Ireland on 10.</p>
      <p>Sweden are fourth with six points but they've played three fewer games.</p>
