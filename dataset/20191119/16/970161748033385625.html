      <p>At least 42 babies and three mothers died at maternity wards covered by a single hospital trust due to a ‘toxic’ culture, a leaked report has claimed.</p>
      <p>Children were also left with disabilities as a result of substandard care at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust in what could possibly be the largest maternity scandal in NHS history.</p>
      <p>Staff at the trust routinely dismissed parents’ concerns, were unkind and got dead babies’ names wrong, according to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/shrewsbury-maternity-scandal/nhs-maternity-scandal-shrewsbury-telford-hospitals-mothers-babies-report-a9207176.html">the document seen by The Independent.</a></p>
      <p>In one troubling case, parents were not told their baby’s body had arrived back from the post-mortem examination, and it was left to decompose so badly the family never got to say goodbye properly.</p>
      <p>The interim update report comes from an independent inquiry led by maternity expert Donna Ockenden, which was launched by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt in July 2017.</p>

      <p>Ms Davies told The Independent the leaked report showed the trust had ‘condemned my daughter to death’, adding: ‘How has this been tolerated for so long? It is horrific.’</p>
      <p>In the report, Ms Ockenden wrote: ‘No apology will be sufficient or adequate for families who lost loved ones to avoidable deaths, or whose experience of becoming a parent was blighted by poor care and avoidable harm.</p>
      <p>‘Many families have described to me how they live on a daily basis with the results of that poor care.’</p>

      <p>The report also criticised the trust’s slow response in sending the inquiry medical records, clinical notes and other documents and warned lessons had still not be learned today and communication with families was still lacking.</p>
      <p>The study’s initial scope was to examine 23 cases but it eventually grew to more than 270 covering the period 1979 to the present day.</p>
      <p>The cases include 22 stillbirths, three deaths during pregnancy, 17 deaths of babies after birth, three deaths of mothers, 47 cases of substandard care and 51 cases of cerebral palsy or brain damage.</p>
      <p>Until now, Morecambe Bay, which saw the avoidable deaths of 11 babies and one mother at Cumbria’s Furness General Hospital between 2004 and 2013, was the worst ever maternity scandal in the UK.</p>

      <p>Ms Ockenden said in a statement the report was produced at the request of NHS Improvement and was not meant for publication.</p>
      <p>The study also criticised carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) that it called inadequate.</p>

      <p>Paula Clark, interim chief executive at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, added: ‘On behalf of the trust, I apologise unreservedly to the families who have been affected.</p>
      <p>‘I would like to reassure all families using our maternity services that we have not been waiting for Donna Ockenden’s final report before working to improve our services.</p>
      <p>‘A lot has already been done to address the issues raised by previous cases.’</p>
      <h3>The leaked report points to:</h3>
      <p>– Babies left brain-damaged because staff failed to realise or act upon signs that labour was going wrong.<br/>– A failure to adequately monitor heartbeats during labour or assess risks during pregnancy, resulting in the deaths of some children.<br/>– Babies left brain-damaged from group B strep or meningitis that can often be treated by antibiotics.<br/>– A baby whose death from group B strep could have been prevented after its parents contacted the trust on several occasions worried about their newborn baby.<br/>– Many families ‘struggling’ to get answers from the trust around ‘very serious clinical incidents’ for many years and continuing to the present day.<br/>– One father whose only feedback following his daughter’s death was when he bumped into a hospital employee in Asda.<br/>– One parent reporting a ‘closed culture’ at the trust over hospital fears of being sued.<br/>– Families who told how ‘the trust made mistakes with their baby’s name and on occasions referred to a deceased baby as “it”’.<br/>– Multiple families ‘where deceased babies are given the wrong names by the trust – frequently in writing’.<br/>– One family who was told they would have to leave if they did not ‘keep the noise down’ when they were upset following the death of their baby.<br/>– One baby girl’s shawl was lost by staff after her death even though her mother had wanted to bury her in it.<br/>– The ‘misplaced’ optimism of the regulator the Healthcare Commission (a predecessor to the Care Quality Commission) that maternity services would improve following its interjection in 2007.<br/>– Families who were advised ‘they were the only family’, and that ‘lessons would be learned’. The report said ‘it is clear this is not correct’.<br/>– A ‘long-term failure’ to involve families in serious incident investigations, some of which were ‘overly defensive of staff’.</p>
