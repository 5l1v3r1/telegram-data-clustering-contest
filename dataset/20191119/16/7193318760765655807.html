      <p>Today's featured event:</p>
      <p>Texas music icon Kinky Friedman is bringing his "Merry Kinkster Tour" to Oklahoma City for a show at 8 tonight at the Blue Door, 2805 N McKinley.</p>
      <p>The tour is supporting his new album, "Resurrection," which was released Oct. 25 on Echo Hill Records.</p>
      <p>Friedman worked with superstar producer, multi-instrumentalist, and three-time Grammy Award winner Larry Campbell, finding a complement to his jagged-edged Texas Hill Country persona. Together with three-time Grammy-winning engineer Justin Guip, they have produced what's billed as one of the crowning achievements of the Kinkster’s career.</p>

      <p>"Resurrection" features 11 new tunes, four of which were co-written by up-and-comer Doc Elliot, including a special guest appearance by long-time Kinky pal Willie Nelson on the title track.</p>
      <p>Tailor-made for Americana radio, the songs are about deep reflection and an even deeper soul. No longer the reckless comic gadfly of his youth, Kinky has found the pathway to the truth that haunts his inner being.</p>
      <p>Like his fellow Texas-born singer-songwriters Billy Joe Shaver and Kris Kristofferson, Kinky speaks to the legends and myths of the great Southwest, always with an eye to the longings, needs and hopes of the modern world. His lyrics are universal, yet his vision is personal, unique to a man who has lived the most special of lives.</p>
      <p>He is being joined at his tour stops by his longtime co-conspirator and legendary Austin band leader Cleve Hattersley, whose new book "Life Is a Butt Dial" (YES Publishing, Austin, Texas) tells the tales of his and Kinky’s adventures together, plus myriad stories of a life in rock and roll, politics and pot smuggling. Hattersley will perform a few songs with his wife, Sweet Mary, and read from his book.</p>
      <p>Brian Molnar, who has accompanied Kinky on several recent tours will be opening nearly all the dates, premiering his new CD, "One of Them" (Avenue A Records).</p>
      <p>Doors open at 7:30 tonight. For tickets and information, go to <a href="http://www.bluedoorokc.com/">www.bluedoorokc.com</a>.</p>
