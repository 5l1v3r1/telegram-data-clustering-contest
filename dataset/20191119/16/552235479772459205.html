      <h1>Get on your bike 'n' ride - Perthshire woman writes book about biking across North America</h1>
      <h2>Lynn hopes book will inspire other women</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:16:50+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:16</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Clark, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/rachel-clark/</a></address>
      <p>A Perthshire woman is hoping to encourage others to follow their dreams, after motorcycling across North America.</p>
      <p>Lynn Aitken (58) from Almondbank only got her motorcycle licence at the age of 49, and wanted to go on an epic adventure.</p>
      <p>In two parts, Lynn and her husband Mike took on the trip of a lifetime by traversing from Mexico, travelling through the US and Canada, and finishing up in Alaska.</p>
      <p>She said: “I only got my motorbike licence at 49.</p>
      <p>“My husband and I were on holiday in Canada and we saw a signpost for the scenic route to Alaska and we both said ‘one day we will have to go down that road’.</p>
      <p>“It took a couple of years of planning and saving up, but in 2016 we headed out to Mexico.</p>
      <p>“When it came to saying goodbye to my kids, that was the biggest step for me to leave my family.</p>
      <p>“It was not just a two week all-inclusive vacation, we were literally riding off and taking on this big challenge.</p>
      <p>“It was a bit of a journey of discovery for me.</p>
      <p>“At first I was absolutely terrified and when we landed I went straight to the departures board to try and go back home.</p>
      <p>“I still don’t know why I did it.”</p>
      <p>The pair travelled all the way to Canada, and had almost made it into Alaska when disaster struck back home.</p>
      <p>Due to a family crisis back in Perthshire, they had to cut their journey short - but they were determined to finish the challenge, and last year went out and completed the leg of Alaska.</p>
      <p>Lynn said: “When we were on our first trip, we got about 20 miles short of Alaska and we had to turn around and come back home.</p>
      <p>“We headed down to Vancouver as quickly as we could.</p>
      <p>“I knew we needed to finish the journey, so we went about saving up to get back out there again.</p>
      <p>“It was niggling at me, I had to finish what we started.</p>

      <p>“All in all it took about six months to do.”</p>
      <p>She continued: “My favourite bit was meeting all the incredible people along the way.</p>
      <p>“They were all so friendly and we have made lifelong friends, we met some of the most amazing people.</p>
      <p>“We tried to do mostly camping, but when we started the first leg it was early in the season and a lot of the campsites weren’t open yet, so we stayed in budget hotels as well.</p>
      <p>“The second part last year was completely camping.</p>
      <p>“The wildlife was amazing as well.</p>
      <p>“In all the places we’ve travelled to, you can’t beat Scotland for scenery, but the wildlife in America was amazing.</p>
      <p>“We saw bears, moose and there was a lone wolf watching us at one point.</p>
      <p>“We went whale watching in a protected area as well and the whales brought their babies up to the boat to show everyone.</p>
      <p>“This was in their birthing area, so only small boats were allowed to approach the whales.</p>
      <p>“I ended up covered in whale snot, but I didn’t care.”</p>
      <p>Since finishing her epic adventure, Lynn has written and published a book on her trip called ‘Long Roads and Lipstick’.</p>
      <p>She hopes she can encourage other women to follow their dreams and take a leap into the unknown while they still can.</p>
      <p>Lynn explained: “There are not many books written by women, particularly women of my age, on motorcycling.</p>
      <p>“It started off just as a thought.</p>
      <p>“All along the way I wrote notes most days and then I thought ‘you know what, I will write a book’.</p>
      <p>“Everyone knows me for always having lipstick on - if I have my lipstick on, I am ready for it all.</p>
      <p>“Other women who write these kinds of books don’t talk about their family, but I am just a normal woman with a family and I want to inspire other people.</p>
      <p>“The book is the story of what happened, but also hints and tips on what we found out along the way.</p>

      <p>“Anyone can do something like this, but the hardest step is the first step, just going out there and doing it.</p>
      <p>“Whatever your dream is, follow it.</p>
      <p>“Before I went out there, my husband had loads of books to read.</p>
      <p>“I started to read one woman’s book as well and it was a good book, but the woman who wrote it was very gung-ho and ‘I can do this’ whereas I was a bit hesitant.</p>
      <p>“I would have loved to have read this book before I went out.</p>
      <p>“There are sad bits in it, but funny bits as well that will have people laughing out loud.”</p>
      <p>She added: “At first I couldn’t get it published so I have done it myself.</p>
      <p>“My daughter said it is perfectly imperfect and now my story is out there.</p>
      <p>“The book is now out on Amazon for £8.99 or on Kindle for £2.99.”</p>
      <p>Lynn and her husband are now planning to do another trip, and are hoping to go east and motorcycle to Russia.</p>
