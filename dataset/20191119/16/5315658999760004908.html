      <p>Police have arrested two people following an aggravated robbery incident at a store on St Heliers Bay Road near the intersection with Grampian Road yesterday evening.</p>
      <p>At around 6.55pm, three men entered the store and demanded cash from the till.</p>
      <p>One of the offenders was allegedly armed with a firearm.</p>
      <p>The three men fled the store with a quantity of cash and cigarettes before driving off in a vehicle described as a red 2000 Nissan Pulsar hatchback vehicle along Grampian Rd towards Hampton Drive.</p>
      <p>A vehicle matching this description was spotted just over 10 minutes later by Police in Eastview Road, Glen Innes.</p>
