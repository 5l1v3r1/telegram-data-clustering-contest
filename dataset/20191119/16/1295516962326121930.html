      <h1>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker Unveils Spectacular New Footage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:11:21+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author">Bea Caicoya</a></address>
      <p>New footage from <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix/">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</a></i> has surfaced online.</p>
      <p>The footage doubles down on Rey's arc, taking fans on a mini-tour of the locations that she'll visit in the film, including the Kijimi's Thieves' Quarter, as well as the First Order room where Rey encounters what looks like a carbonized Darth Vader relic.</p>

      <p>One of the most spectacular shots takes place in a First Order hangar, where Kylo Ren observes Rey jumping through the void of space and into the <i>Millenium Falcon</i>. However, we also go to the planet of Pasaana, where we see Rey shoot a blaster at two sandtroopers pursuing her through the desert.</p>
      <p>The clip also shows a very detailed closeup of Kylo Ren's reforged mask, as well as of Rey's absolute fury while she duels with him. The final shot then reprises the scene where the Emperor hovers over Rey on what looks like a massive Shah-tezh (<i>Star Wars</i> chess) board.</p>
      <p>Directed and co-written by J.J. Abrams, <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> stars Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Anthony Daniels, Naomi Ackie, Domhnall Gleeson, Richard E. Grant, Lupita Nyong’o, Keri Russell, Joonas Suotamo, Kelly Marie Tran, with Ian McDiarmid and Billy Dee Williams. The film arrives on Dec. 20.</p>
