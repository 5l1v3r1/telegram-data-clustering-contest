      <p>The roll out of high speed broadband will see a €76 million investment in Meath to deliver the service to 18,989 premises across the county.</p>
      <p>The roll-out of the scheme is set to begin in 2021 and has been described by Minister Helen McEntee as “comparable in significance to the electrification of rural Ireland.”<br/>Initial works will begin next year with Broadband Connection Points to be located in Boardsmill GAA Club, Castletown GAA Club, The Church Hall, Crossakiel, Cormeen Sports Complex, Culmullen Community Hall, Culmullin, Drumree, Killallon Community Hall, Clonmellon, Kilskyre Community Hall, Kilskyre, Meath Hill Community Centre, Rathkenny Hall, Syddan Gaelic Football Club and Teach Raithneach Heritage and Cultural Centre, Starinagh.<br/>Minister McEntee said that the signing of the National Broadband Plan will transform rural Ireland.<br/>“This is one the biggest issues facing rural Ireland today. This was the single biggest issue raised with me in rural Meath prior to the last general election. If we want balanced regional development, we simply must have high speed broadband rolled out across the country, with no exceptions. While Meath has over 70 per cent broadband coverage this figure needs to be 100 per cent. Constituents of mine continuously outline the unsatisfactory broadband services they currently have in their area and the need to see improvements for everyone.<br/>“This plan will ensure access to broadband for those who currently do not have it. It will help to make remote working a reality; help farmers and businesses transform how they function on a daily basis. In schools, children and teachers will have the ability to teach and learn in a modern and connected world. These benefits have offshoots too, with reduction in commute times, a better quality of life and it will be good for our environment too,” she said,<br/>Minister McEntee said the roll-out of high speed broadband has been promised for many years but is now finally being delivered.<br/>“This announcement is the final step before works on the ground will take place early next year.<br/>“I will continue to work with my constituents to ensure that this plan is delivered on time and to the standard they expect. This is the 21st century version of the electrification of rural Ireland and one that will stand to us over the coming decades,” she said.</p>
