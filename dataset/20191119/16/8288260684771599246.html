      <p>Tamworth twins will have double the fun when they perform lead roles in a Christmas classic.</p>
      <p>Conor and Caitlin Dodds, aged 11, from The Leys, are playing Tiny Tim and Grace Smythe in this year’s BMOS (Birmingham Musical and Operatic Society) show, A Christmas Carol, at The Alexandra Theatre Birmingham from November 26 to 30.</p>
      <p>The duo, who go to Shire Oak Academy in Walsall, were overheard singing one of their favourite songs at a show two years ago and impressed so much that they were asked to come back and audition.</p>
      <p>Proud dad Mark, who is a chaperone at BMOS, beamed: “They both just love to be involved in any aspects of the theatre and are thrilled to be performing at such an amazing theatre.</p>

      <p>“Caitlin and Conor were just spotted in the lobby of the Alexandra Theatre singing songs from My Fair Lady which was the BMOS show on at the time in 2017.</p>
      <p>“A committee member heard them and asked them to come along and audition which is what they did.</p>
      <p>“They are so excited, absolutely over the moon. They are currently rehearsing three times a week.</p>
      <p>“They are prestigious roles to get. A lot of people went for them and at this level there is not much higher that you can go.</p>
      <p>“I am so proud of them. They have never been to theatre school, they just like musicals. They would like to get into BOA (Birmingham Ormiston Academy) when they are in year 10. They have just started year seven.</p>
      <p>   </p>
      <p>“They love their music, anything from Dolly Parton to your modern R’n’B.</p>
      <p>“It is the best feeling ever seeing your kids having the times of their lives on stage. There is no better feeling.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people are coming to watch them, our family will be travelling and I will be there every night.</p>
      <p>“Local people do get a chance at these big theatres.</p>
      <p>“They want to send out a message that if you see an audition for something and it is something you want to do just go for it as you never know. Don’t get put off by any knock backs - it is all a good experience.”</p>
      <p>Caitlin and Conor, who have previously performed in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, King and I and Miracle on 34th Street, are also currently rehearsing for their school production, School of Rock, which is one of their favourites.</p>
      <p>Their dream roles are from Bugsie Malone with Caitlin playing Tallula and Conor playing Bugsy.</p>
      <p>Away from the theatre they both play football and are in the same team, Deer Park under 12s.</p>

      <p>Caitlin attends Tamworth Olympic Gymnastics club and they enjoy visiting new places to explore, especially by the sea.</p>
      <p>A Christmas Carol is an adaptation of Charles Dickens’ well known story.</p>
      <p>Ebenezer Scrooge is a prosperous curmudgeon who believes personal wealth is far more valuable than the happiness and comfort of others.</p>
      <p>With an infuriated ‘Bah! Humbug!’ Scrooge summates his feelings of Christmas tidings and charitable giving, but he is forced to face his selfish ways when three ghosts on Christmas Eve lead him through his past, present and future.</p>
      <p>Thanks to their guidance, Scrooge recognises his faults and greets Christmas morning with a cheerful Happy Christmas before spending the festive day reconnecting and sharing the love with those that mean the most to <br/>him.</p>
