      <p>Amazon has already green-lit the second season of their adaptation of <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/J.R.R.+Tolkien">J.R.R. Tolkien</a>’s <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, ahead of the show’s premiere.</p>

      <p>While pre-production gets going in New Zealand, the head of Amazon Studios, Jennifer Salke, has confirmed that they have “commissioned the reassembling of the writers room to break the second season,” per <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/the-lord-of-the-rings-series-renewed-season-2-amazon-early-renewal-season-1-hiatus-writers-room-reassembled-1202788730/"><i>Deadline</i></a>. Despite acquiring the global TV rights (for <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/11/lord-of-the-rings-tv-series-moving-forward.html">a reported cool $250 million</a>) in 2017 to a multi-season commitment to a <i>LOTR</i> series as well as a potential spinoff series, the streamer is still required to formally green-light each subsequent season.</p>
      <p><i>Deadline</i> also reports that the show will take a brief hiatus after filming the first two episodes of the first season (directed by <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/07/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-director-ja-bayona-t.html">J.A. Bayona</a>) to allow the writing team, headed up by showrunners and executive producers J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay, time to flesh out Season 2’s scripts.</p>
      <p>Not much is known about the plot beyond the fact that the new show is set to give life to the Second Age of Middle-Earth (so, Morgoth’s final defeat up through the Battle of the Last Alliance), preceding <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/J.R.R.+Tolkien">J.R.R. Tolkien</a>’s <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>. The cast has yet to be fully confirmed by Amazon, but <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/07/lord-of-the-rings-markella-kavenagh-amazon-prime.html">Markella Kavenagh</a>, <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/09/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-will-poulter.html">Will Poulter</a> and <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/10/lord-of-the-rings-main-villain-cast.html">Joseph Mawle</a> have reportedly come aboard in key roles.</p>
