        <b>The Vila Nova de Gaia City Council will install video surveillance systems in the Historic Centre and in places with greater security risk, a project that costs about 400 thousand Euros, revealed the Mayor</b>
      </p>
      <p>The process will move forward in the first quarter of 2020, said Eduardo Vítor Rodrigues at the budget and plan presentation session for next year, but the mayor sought to safeguard that "there are no effective reasons to intervene immediately."</p>
      <p>"We have no supplemental crime rate, nor do we have any concrete cases, but I think we all realize that security is not about waiting for accidents or occurrences to intervene," said the socialist mayor.</p>
      <p>Eduardo Vítor Rodrigues analyzed that in the Historic Centre "there is already" and "should" increase "the proliferation of people", which is why this municipality of Porto decided to move forward with video surveillance that "guarantees tranquillity and subjective security".</p>
      <p>Alongside this project, the Vila Nova de Gaia City Council will also ask the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the location on the riverside of a tourist station.</p>
      <p>"It will have an informative side, but also the associated security component," explained Eduardo Vítor Rodrigues already on the sidelines of presenting a budget of 199.8 million Euros for 2020.</p>
      <p>This theme is part of the "Create" axis, which contains other priorities such as "strengthening neighbourhood policing in schools and social urbanization", while the "Promote" axis, among other subjects, speaks of "renewing and strengthening the framework" of municipal staff".</p>
      <p>In this regard, the mayor of Gaia said that "for more than 15 years there have been no entry contests for people in the municipality", because, among other factors, it violated the debt limit and could not contract, and they left 100 people a year for retirement.</p>
      <p>Thus, to fill this area, Gaia has ongoing or open competitions for 79 senior technicians, 46 technical assistants, 33 operational assistants and 15 management positions, adding 22 vacancies for the Firefighters and the Municipal Police.</p>
      <p>In the presentation, the mayor also promised "not to lose sight of the community framework", noting that when overbooking arises it will be said, for "municipalities that already have projects prepared and mature".</p>
