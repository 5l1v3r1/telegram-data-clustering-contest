      <h1>Liam Hemsworth in high spirits as he returns to LA amid Maddison Brown romance</h1>

      <p>Liam Hemsworth has been spotted arriving at LAX following his split from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/miley-cyrus/">Miley Cyrus</a>.</p>
      <p>Bit rude of him to look that good getting off a flight, but okay.</p>
      <p>The actor, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/16/inside-liam-hemsworths-lovey-dovey-date-maddison-brown-following-miley-cyrus-split-10927148/">who’s currently </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/16/inside-liam-hemsworths-lovey-dovey-date-maddison-brown-following-miley-cyrus-split-10927148/"> fellow Aussie actress Maddison Brown</a>, looked in high spirits as he arrived at the LA airport, giving fans a thumbs up.</p>
      <p>Rocking a casual look, the Hunger Games star looked chill as anything as he returned to his American home after his time in Australia.</p>
      <p>Liam and Miley shocked fans earlier this year, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/11/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-split-less-year-marriage-love-officially-dead-10551978/">when they confirmed their split after a decade together.</a></p>

      <p>With the Wrecking Ball packing on some PDA with Cody Simpson, Liam has been getting cosy with his new beau Maddison.</p>
      <p>Following his split from Miley, the Aussie actor<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/20/liam-hemsworth-wants-move-back-native-australia-devastating-split-miley-cyrus-10602897/"> was said to be hiding out in Byron Bay in his Aussie homeland</a>, with<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/02/liam-hemsworth-buys-home-next-to-brother-chris-proving-sibling-bond-is-unbreakable-11032059/"> his brother Chris providing him a shoulder to lean on.</a></p>

      <p>Can we get a Hemsworth brother of our own please?</p>
      <p>However, upon his return to the US, he headed straight for New York City, where he and Maddison were pictured enjoying a lunch date at Sant Ambroeus in the West Village of New York City, looking absolutely smitten.</p>
      <p>29-year-old Liam was papped in the US with the 22-year-old actress, best known for playing Kirby Anders on the Dynasty reboot, and also had a role in Strangerland opposite Nicole Kidman.</p>

      <p>The pair <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/12/liam-hemsworth-taking-slow-maddison-brown-miley-cyrus-split-10905354/">are said to be taking things slow with their ‘very new’ relationship</a>, although a source <a href="https://people.com/movies/liam-hemsworth-taking-it-slow-maddison-brown-after-miley-cyrus-split/">told People magazine</a> recently Liam is ‘definitely interested’ in the Dynasty actress.</p>
      <p>So cute!</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-split-month-hot-heavy-dating-11179089/">Miley is reportedly taking some time apart from Cody</a>, with the PDA on social media dying down.</p>
      <p>Miley, 26, apparently wants to focus on herself and is backing off from her relationship with the Australian singer for now. A <a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2019/11/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-split-on-break-whirlwind-romance/">source told Radar Online</a>: ‘They are taking a break, but want to remain friends.</p>
      <p>‘She said she just needs to focus on herself.’</p>
