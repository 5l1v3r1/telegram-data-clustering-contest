        <b>Twenty-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer has reiterated that he has no plans to retire from tennis in the near future.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Swiss star has just completed his 21st professional season in the sport. And despite being 38 years old, Federer says he's still enjoying competing at the highest level.</p>
      <p>"My retirement is going to depend on my health," he said at a press conference held at a hotel in Puerto Madero on Monday.</p>
      <p>"At this moment I see no reason to stop. I think in 2009 I questioned it for the first time.</p>
      <p>"[It's been] ten years and here I am. I'm exactly where I wanted to be at this age.</p>
      <p>"It is a lot of work stay. I expected to play until 35-36 and here I am, in a new dimension."</p>
      <p>Federer will finish the year at number three in the ATP Tour rankings, having lost a semi-final to Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3, 6-4 on Saturday in London. He had impressively beaten Novak Djokovic earlier in the ATP Finals tournament at The O2.</p>

      <p>After the Tsitsipas defeat, the eight-time Wimbledon men's singles champion <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/news/federer-nitto-atp-finals-2019-saturday-sf-reaction">said he was happy</a> with the level of performances he had reached this year.</p>
      <p>“I've got to keep on playing at the level like I have this year, and then I will create some chances.</p>
      <p>"I thought I played some consistent, solid tennis. Got to take care of my body, listen to the signs, work well with the team, get the balance right with everything that's happening in my life.</p>
      <p>“But I'm happy how I played this season, and I'm extremely excited for next season.”</p>
      <p>Federer and Alexander Zverev have travelled to Argentina to take part in an exhibition tour of North and South America.</p>
      <p>He and the 22-year-old German will face off in five different countries across seven days.</p>
      <p>Federer's exhibition schedule will also see him take on old rival Rafael Nadal in February 2020 in South Africa - the Swiss stars' mother's home country.</p>
