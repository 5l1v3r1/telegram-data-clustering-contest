        <b>Sydney-based Tyro Payments is seeking to raise around A$250 million by floating on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).</b>
      </p>
      <p>The payment services provider has lodged its initial public offering prospectus with an indicative price range of A$2.50 to A$2.75 which, at the top end, wold give it a market capitalisation of A$1.36 billion.<br/><br/>Founded in 2003, Tyro has 450 employees and is Australia's fifth largest Eftpos provider, processing more than A$17.5 billion in transactions in full year 2019. However, it expects to report a fourth straight annual loss in 2020.<br/><br/>In 2015 it raised A$100 million and obtained a banking license to take on traditional lenders by offering small businesses associated banking products. <br/><br/>The float will see Tyro broaden its shareholder base of about 450 and give the firm the "financial flexibility" to support its growth strategy, says a statement. Institutional investors have already committed to acquire A$140 million in shares.<br/><br/>Robbie Cooke, CEO and MD, Tyro, says: "Our focus remains firmly on challenging the status quo for the benefit of our merchants. I am particularly excited that Tyro merchants have the ability to invest in our future success by participating in our merchant offer."</p>
