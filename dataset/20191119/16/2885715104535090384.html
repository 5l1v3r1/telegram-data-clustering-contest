      <p>Colors reality show Bigg Boss season 13 witnesses an eviction every weekend. You might feel shocked or upset about your favourite contestant getting evicted from the show. However, there are ways to save them from elimination.</p>
      <p>While we are already familiar with the missed calls and SMS pattern of saving a contestant from getting evicted, did you know there are other ways to vote for your favourite contestant?</p>
      <p>The Voot app, which also has exclusive unseen footage of Bigg Boss 13 house, has a section where you can vote for your favourite contestant and save them from eviction. But to do so, you will have to log in to the Voot app with either your <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/google/">google</a> ID or <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/facebook/">Facebook</a>. You can also register yourself on the Voot app.</p>
      <p>Once you log in, you will notice a photo of Bigg Boss 13 host <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/salman-khan/">Salman Khan</a> along with the following text – VOTE TO SAVE YOUR FAVOURITE CONTESTANT. Click the photo and it takes you to the voting landing page containing photos of the nominated contestants. Choose your favourite contestant and then click on the submit button.</p>
      <p>You can also vote online through the website. The link is <a href="https://www.voot.com/bigg-boss/bigg-boss-season-13/bigg-boss-13-voting-online/webview">https://www.voot.com/bigg-boss/bigg-boss-season-13/bigg-boss-13-voting-online/webview</a></p>
