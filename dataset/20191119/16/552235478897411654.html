      <h2>Planning condition is dropped by Perth and Kinross Council</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:34:15+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author">Kathryn Anderson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/kathryn-anderson/</a></address>
      <p>A planning condition has been removed to allow an Aberfeldy farmer’s son to continue living in the house recently built for him.</p>
      <p>Perth and Kinross Council’s local review body this week overturned a decision that prevented the son of a Mr McAdam and his family from getting a mortgage for their home, built within a mile of his farm near Keltneyburn.</p>
      <p>In 2010, the family secured planning permission for a family home which was finished within two years.</p>
      <p>The house was built with the condition it was occupied by someone who worked solely or was last employed in agriculture at Easter Comrie Farm. At the same time, planning permission was granted for an agricultural building.</p>
      <p>A series of personal circumstances then led both the farmer and his son to vastly reduce the farming enterprise and operations at Easter Comrie farm.</p>
      <p>Just as the house was finished in 2012, they recommenced the leasing of 155 acres of land and later sold their 170-acre deer enterprise in 2016.</p>
      <p>The remaining farming enterprise now consists of 155 acres let out to two separate parties for arable and sheep grazing and a further 20 acres around the site of the original farmhouse where the applicant’s father, who is now retired, lives.</p>
      <p>Despite the remaining farming enterprise significantly changing, Mr McAdam’s son was seeking to change the condition so as he could remain close to his dad and help run the remaining farming enterprise operations whilst re-commencing some commercial aspects, such as deer stalking, and extend the current dwelling house to accommodate his expanding family.</p>
      <p>In order to extend the house, a mortgage was needed to fund the building work which could only be obtained if this condition was changed.</p>
      <p>PKC planning officers rejected this request in June.</p>
      <p>An appeal was then submitted and considered by the local review body last Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Cllr Willie Wilson said he found the case “more difficult” and while he understood the planning officers providing the report they had, on balance he was “inclined to allow the review.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Richard Watters agreed the appeal should be granted.</p>
      <p>He added: “The farm does not exist in the way it did 10 years ago.</p>
      <p>“It creates a conundrum on what ties the house to the farm.”</p>
      <p>Convener, Cllr Henry Anderson upheld the views of the officers but was outvoted by two to one.</p>
