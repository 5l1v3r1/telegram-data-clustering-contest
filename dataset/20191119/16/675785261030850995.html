      <h2>Premier League stars earn mammoth salaries but the gulf between them and the average full-time worker is immense with David De Gea needing just 20 minutes to buy his Aston Martin</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:27:08+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:27</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Meade</a></address>
      <p>Most Premier League footballers can match the average full-time worker's annual salary in five days, according to new data.</p>
      <p>Latest UK figures, which have been revealed by spotrac.com, show that the average worker pockets £584.90 a week which adds up to £30,415 a year before tax.</p>
      <p>That means the average Premier League star needs just under five days to earn the same salary.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> pay their players, including the likes of Sergio Aguero and Kevin De Bruyne on average, £115,000 per week, which is a league high.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Sheffield United's players - such as captain John Egan, midfield star John Lundstram and boyhood fan striker Billy Sharp - take home just £9,000 per week on average.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> kicked off the top flight campaign against Norwich at 8pm on August 9 meaning that the average top flight star would've matched the average full-time employee's salary by 1:32pm on August 14.</p>
      <p>To put it into perspective N'Golo Kante's Mini Cooper S, which is valued at £23,395, would've taken him just 10 minutes and 15 seconds to buy outright based on his weekly salary.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> new boy Tanguy Ndombele joined from Lyon in the summer and was able to afford his Volkswagen Touareg in just 16 minutes.</p>

      <p>The north London pair of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Son Heung-min boast the most expensive cars in the Premier League - a Ferrari LaFerraris.</p>
      <p>The Italian car is valued at £1.15m and it will have taken the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> man six hours and 18 minutes of playing time to pocked the funds.</p>
      <p>Son's wages, which don't quite match Aubameyang's, mean his Ferrari will have taken him a little over nine hours to afford.</p>

      <p>Liverpool star Roberto Firmino, who drives a Rolls Royce Phantom, will have needed two hours and 11 minutes on the pitch to stump up the £360,000 required to buy his car.</p>
      <p>The Reds are second to City as the team with the highest average weekly wage on £100,000.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and Arsenal all pay their plays north of £90,000 with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> , who currently occupy second place, paying an average wage of £50,000.</p>
