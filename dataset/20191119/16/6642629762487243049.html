      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/france.html">France</a>'s top appeals court has confirmed the two-year suspended jail terms given to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/05/150512024141932.html">Pablo Picasso</a>'s former electrician and his wife, who hoarded 271 of the great painter's works in a garage for 40 years.</p>
      <p>Tuesday's verdict by the Lyon Court is the latest twist in a decade-long legal saga, which took the couple, who claim the works were a gift, all the way to France's top appeals court.</p>

      <p>Pierre and Danielle Le Guennec were first given two-year suspended terms in 2015 after being convicted of possession of stolen goods over the huge trove of works by Picasso, including nine rare Cubist collages and a work from his famous Blue Period.</p>
      <p>That verdict was upheld in 2016 by a higher court but then quashed by the Cour de Cassation, which ordered a retrial.</p>
      <p>The former electrician, 80, and his wife, 76, were not in court on Tuesday when they were found guilty for a third time.</p>
      <p>"It is a triumph of truth and marks the end of a cover-up", said Jean-Jacques Neuer, the lawyer for Picasso's son Claude Ruiz-Picasso.</p>
      <p>He accused Pierre Le Guennec of playing for art dealers, "the role that drug mules play in drug-trafficking", alleging that rich art dealers had sought to exploit the couple.</p>
      <p>The Le Guennecs have always denied stealing the works.</p>
      <h3>Loyal service</h3>
      <p>At his original trial, Pierre Le Guennec claimed that Picasso had presented him with the artworks towards the end of his life to reward him for his loyal service.</p>
      <p>But he later changed his account, telling an appeal court that the works were part of a huge collection that Picasso's widow Jacqueline asked him to conceal after the artist's death in 1973.</p>
      <p>Le Guennec said he stored more than a dozen rubbish bags of unsigned works which Jacqueline later retrieved, except for one bag which she left him saying: "Keep this, it's for you."</p>
      <p>The affair came to light when Pierre Le Guennec attempted to get the works authenticated by Claude Ruiz-Picasso in 2010.</p>
      <p>The artist's heirs promptly filed a complaint against him, triggering an investigation.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the latest ruling, Neuer said: "If you have 271 works by Picasso and you want to put them on the international market you need a certificate of authenticity.</p>
      <p>"If you see the Picasso estate and tell them these works fell from the sky or you picked them up from the bric-a-brac market, there is little chance anyone will believe you."</p>
