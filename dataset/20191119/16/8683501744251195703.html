      <p>Martin Scorsese has spent the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483918/martin-scorsese-is-still-explaining-his-marvel-comments">last few weeks clarifying some comments</a> he made ahead of the premiere of his new Netflix movie <i>The Irishman</i> indicating that he feels Marvel movies are “not cinema.” A lot of people related to Marvel – <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484408/marvels-kevin-feige-breaks-silence-about-martin-scorseses-criticism-over-superhero-movies">including head honcho Kevin Feige</a> – have stood up for Marvel movies in the aftermath, but <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>’s directors, the Russo brothers, have been silent on the topic until now.</p>
      <p>When asked how they feel about Martin Scorsese’s now-famous comments, Joe Russo mentioned it’s difficult to have dialogue when the director hasn’t even seen all of Marvel’s Phase One through Phase Three movies, also going on to say,</p>
      <blockquote>But, at the end of the day, what do we know? We’re just two guys from Cleveland, Ohio, and ‘cinema’ is a New York word. In Cleveland, we call them movies.</blockquote>
      <p>The directing duo also shared they feel that <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>’s success is not just a “financial” win, but also an “emotional” win, telling <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/avengers-endgame-directors-break-silence-martin-scorsese-attack-1255560?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=referral">THR</a> the movie had “unprecedented impact” on its audience. To them, this seemingly makes Marvel movies a real cinematic experience, with Anthony Russo also explaining he doesn’t necessarily feel Scoresese’s big commentary on the state of cinema is on the mark. His opinion?</p>
      <blockquote>The other way to think about it, too, is nobody owns cinema. We don’t own cinema. You don’t own cinema. Scorsese doesn’t own cinema.</blockquote>
      <p>Ultimately, whether they are working on <i>Captain America: The Winter Solider</i>, <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> or smaller projects such as <i>Cherry</i>, they feel the work they are doing is movie-making. Both of the Russo brothers seem pretty even-keeled when presenting their opinions, but that last comment in particular “Scorsese doesn’t own cinema” really drives their point home.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, at the end of the day, there are a lot of moviegoers and critics who see what Anthony and Joe Russo are doing as important to the movie-going experience. Martin Scorsese’s feelings aren’t going to stop the men from making movies, and I don’t think his comments were ever intended to.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482391/martin-scorsese-clarifies-controversial-comments-about-marvel-movies">what Martin Scorsese has said</a>, he likens the types of movies Marvel is creating to the theme park experience, meaning it’s more about going on a fun ride than having an authentic cinematic experience. There are other movies outside of Marvel that are attempting the same thing <i>The Irishman</i> director has described, but it’s been convenient for Scorsese to specifically call out Marvel, given the studio’s fame and the similar tone and formula many of its movies have followed.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, most people are going to catch Martin Scorsese's next movie <i>The Irishman</i> not on a big screen. There are limited screenings in theaters of <i>The Irishman</i>, many of which <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483709/the-irishman-tickets-are-selling-for-big-bucks-thanks-to-netflix-limited-release">are selling secondhand tickets at high prices</a>, after which the movie will hit Netflix. You <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484285/martin-scorseses-the-irishman-how-you-can-watch-the-new-netflix-movie">can watch that particular piece of "cinema</a>" from the comfort of your own home.</p>
