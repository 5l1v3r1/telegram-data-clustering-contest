        <b>The Appeal Court sitting in Abuja has affirmed Emeka Ihedioha’s victory as the duly elected sovernor of Imo state.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Channels TV reports that the court delivered the judgment on Tuesday, November 19 following an appeal filed by the Action Alliance (AA), All Progressive Grand Alliance and the All Progressive Congress (APC) challenging the election of Ihedioha.</p>
      <p>According to the report, all appellants argued in their appeal that the governor did not obtain the constitutionally required one-quarter of the votes cast in at least, two-thirds of the 27 local government areas of the state, as provided under Section 179 of the Constitution.</p>
      <p>The appellants, therefore, prayed the court to set aside the decision of the tribunal and declare them winner of the election or in the alternative order a rerun.</p>
      <p>The court, however, dismissed the cases and affimed Ihedioha's election as Imo state governor.</p>

      <p>New Telegraph reports that apart from dismissing the petition brought before it against the election for lack of merit, the appeal court also fined the AA gubernatorial candidate, Mr. Uche Nwosu to the tune of five hundred thousand naira (N500, 000), for waste of time.</p>
      <p>The court reasoned that Nwosu should have had no business appealing the verdict of the tribunal which had earlier affirmed Gov. Ihedioha's victory.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the appeal court struck out the petition of APC governorship candidate, Senator Hope Uzodimma against the election of the governor</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Imo government has disowned group, Coalition of South East Youth Leaders, who gave herdsmen in the state in 24 hours to leave.</p>
      <p>In a statement sent to journalists on Monday, November 18, the spokesman to the Governor Ihedioha, Chibuike Onyeukwu, stated that <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276853-imo-state-govt-disowns-group-ultimatum-herdsmen.html">the group lacks legitimacy to speak for the state.</a></p>
      <p>Onyeukwu described the report of the ultimatum as an embarrassment to the government and people of the state, urging members of the public to disregard it.</p>
