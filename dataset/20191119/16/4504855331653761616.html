      <p>FORT LAUDERDALE, FLA. (WSVN) - Broward County Commissioners have elected Dave V.C. Holness as the county’s new mayor, Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Holness was Vice Mayor to Mark Bogen and has represented cities in District 9, such as Lauderhill, Lauderdale Lakes, Plantation and Oakland Park since 2010.</p>
      <p>As is Broward’s tradition, Holness succeeds Bogen.</p>
      <p>The new Vice Mayor is Steve Geller.</p>
      <p>Unlike Miami-Dade County, Broward doesn’t have an elected mayor, and they only serve a one-year term after being elected by the commission.</p>
