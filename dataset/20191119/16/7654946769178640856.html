      <h1>Carmelo Anthony calls signing with the Trail Blazers a ‘perfect opportunity’</h1>

      <p>Carmelo Anthony hasn’t had a chance to appear in an NBA game in more than a year, but the former Knicks star believes the Portland Trail Blazers represented the “perfect opportunity” to get back into the league.</p>
      <p>The 10-time All-Star forward said as much on his “Melo Mondays” YouTube channel, one day ahead of <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/carmelo-anthony-finally-gets-back-into-nba-with-trail-blazers/">joining his new team</a> in New Orleans for Tuesday’s game against the Pelicans.</p>
      <p>“I always kept my eye on Portland,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=q8OfgGAf4c0&amp;feature=emb_title">Anthony said</a>. “It just didn’t work out at other times. But now it seems like a perfect opportunity…I just look at that opportunity, that team, and say, ‘This is what I can bring, this is where I can help.’ It will only work if all parties see it the same way.”</p>
      <p>The Blazers, who announced the Anthony signing Tuesday morning after Anthony passed his physical, are 5-9 after a 132-108 loss Monday night in Houston. Anthony hasn’t played in an NBA game since Nov. 8 of last season with the Rockets before he was traded to and waived by Chicago. He said he received a call from the Portland front office last Wednesday, and by the next day there “was a commitment.”</p>
      <p>“What happened before is the past; I can’t dwell on that. I learned from that,” Anthony said. “This happened at a point of time in my life where I do have a lot of clarity and understanding of different situations, and just life. My approach is totally different.”</p>
      <p>Anthony, 35, added that he took a few days to ramp up his workouts and his mental state before reporting for what will be his 17th NBA season.</p>
      <p>“The last year and a half, man, has just been like an emotional rollercoaster,” Anthony said. “Mentally and emotionally I had almost detached myself from the game a little bit.</p>
      <p>“Once I got that call, the challenge was for me to just flip that back mentally. It’s a big difference in training while you’re waiting and training once you get the call to say, OK, we want to do this.”</p>
