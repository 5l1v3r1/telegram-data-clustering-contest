      <p>A teenager allegedly who was allegedly held captive and repeatedly raped has killed herself.</p>
      <p>The girl, identified only as Pinkie, 13, allegedly jumped from the top of a block of flats to her death in Bangkok, Thailand, on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Moments before her death she sent a message that said ‘I’m about to go, I love you’, showing her legs dangling over the roof from where she apparently took her life.</p>
      <p>Her mother, 45, reported six men for gang rape in a flat in the city less than a week before her death.</p>
      <p>She said that her daughter had spiralled into a deep depression as a result of the sex attacks she suffered.</p>

      <p>A Royal Thai Police spokesman said: ‘Suspects face charges for collaborating to sexually abuse the girl.</p>
      <p>‘There were two girls, two boys on the night of the incident. One of the girls, Pinkie, is dead. Warrants have been issued for both boys.’</p>
      <p>The girl’s friend was said to have been found at the scene by police.</p>
      <p>The spokesman said that other suspects had been taken into custody after being arrested on a weapons charge.</p>
      <p>They said: ‘When we raided the first suspect’s home, we found weapons in his house, so we detained him and charged him with illegally possessing firearms.</p>
      <p>‘He is currently locked up. Meanwhile, the court just approved the warrant for the second suspect this morning.’</p>
