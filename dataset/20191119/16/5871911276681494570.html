      <h1>Brewers show off brand-new uniforms for next season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:03:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/tsd-staff/" target="_blank">TSD Staff</a></address>
      <p>The Milwaukee Brewers saw their team get eliminated from the postseason in brutal fashion — with closer Bill Hader, one of the best in the business, blowing a 3-1 lead with two outs in the eighth inning of the NL Wild Card game against the Nationals.</p>
      <p>Not only that, the Brewers had to go on and watch the Nationals use that momentum to carry them to a World Series win, their first in franchise history.</p>
      <p>As such, they’re in need of a bit of a makeover, especially since they have a few free agents that likely won’t be with the team next season, heading into the Winter Meetings next month. They did that by giving a first look at the team’s new uniforms — with 2018 MVP Christian Yelich wearing them — and they are awesome.</p>
