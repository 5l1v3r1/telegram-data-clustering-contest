      <h1>Lamborghini Aventador SVJ Gets Aggressive New Look</h1>
      <h2>Lamborghiniâ€™s flagship supercar just got even more extreme.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:10:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:10</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lamborghini/aventador-svj-coupe">Lamborghini Aventador SVJ</a> is the most powerful and sportiest version of Lamborghini's flagship supercar, but <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/novitec-tunes-the-hell-out-of-the-mclaren-720s">aftermarket tuner Novitec</a>, which recently modified the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lamborghini/urus">Lamborghini Urus</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lamborghini/huracan-performante">Lamborghini Huracan Performante</a>, has decided to take the flagship supercar to a new extreme with a selection of naked carbon components that were fine-tuned in a wind tunnel to deliver optimal aerodynamic efficiency.</p>
      <p>At the front of the range-topping supercar, the tuner has added a more prominent front spoiler lip and mounted new front flaps to the upper end of the central air intake, giving the SVJ an angrier face. In addition, front-axle lift at high speeds has been reduced to improve stability, and the hood features longer air outlets. Novitec's rocket panel attachments in front of the rear wheel arches give the profile a sportier appearance, while air intakes on the side windows channel airflow more effectively to the radiators in the rear end.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere, carbon scoops for the upper air intakes at the sides optimize air cooling for the 12-cylinder engine behind the cockpit and a central scoop on the hood routes the airflow directly to the ALA system for the rear end. This system has adjustable flaps on the hood to optimize the aerodynamics. In addition, Novitec's airbox supplies the engine bay with additional fresh air and rear flaps below the wing help generate even more downforce at high speeds.</p>
      <p>Novitec's Lamborghini Aventador SVJ sits on forged 20-inch Vossen wheels that emphasize the supercar's wedge shape and are available in 72 different colors. The rims come wrapped in high-performance Pirelli tires. Sport springs also lower the car's height by around 1.3 inches.</p>

      <p>As for the powertrain, the SVJ's 6.5-liter, 12-cylinder V12 has been left stock, although it probably doesn't need any more power considering it already produces 759 horsepower and 537 lb-ft of torque. However, performance can be optimized with three different stainless high-performance sport exhaust systems with or without actively controlled exhaust flaps that allow the V12 to breathe easier while giving it a more exhilarating exhaust note.</p>
      <p>They also reduce the car's weight by 42 pounds depending on the exhaust system. Inside, the cabin can be customized with leather, Alcantara and carbon materials in virtually any desired color and upholstery design.</p>
