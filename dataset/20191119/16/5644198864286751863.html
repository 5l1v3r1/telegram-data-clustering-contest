      <p>LOS ANGELES: James Harden scored 36 points and Russell Westbrook bagged a triple double as the Houston Rockets extended their red-hot winning streak to eight games with a 132-108 rout of the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday (Nov 18).</p>
      <p>Harden, fresh from a 49-point display in Saturday's win over Minnesota, was once again in commanding form against a Portland team who were always second best at Houston's Toyota Center.</p>

      <p>The 2017-2018 NBA Most Valuable Player also had six rebounds and five assists as the Blazers struggled to contain the Rockets' multi-pronged offense.</p>
      <p>Westbrook tormented the Portland defense, finishing with 28 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists on a night when all five Houston starters finished in double figures.</p>
      <p>Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni praised the contribution of Westbrook.</p>
      <p>"Russell had an extra gear tonight, but it's hard to single out one guy," D'Antoni said. "They're all playing well."</p>
      <p>The Rockets coach reserved special praise for Harden though, once again repeating his belief that the 30-year-old is the best offensive player he has ever seen.</p>
      <p>"I'm lost for words," D'Antoni said.</p>
      <p>"What he does is unbelievable... No matter what the other teams try to do, double-team or whatever, he just figures it out. It's incredible what he's doing."</p>
      <p>The win saw the Rockets improve to 11-3 at the top of the Western Conference, neck-and-neck with the pace-setting Los Angeles Lakers (11-2).</p>
      <p>CJ McCollum led the scoring for Portland with 25 points, but team-mate Damian Lillard was kept quiet with only 13 points. Portland fell to 5-9 with the defeat.</p>

        <b>'ALONG FOR THE RIDE'</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Dallas, Luka Doncic scored a career-high 42 points and bagged a triple double to guide the Mavericks to a 117-110 win over the San Antonio Spurs.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old Slovenian is the second youngest player in history to score a 40-point triple double after LeBron James.</p>
      <p>"It's not surprising to me," Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said.</p>
      <p>"This guy can do anything he wants to on a basketball court. And you know, he's having just one of those magical runs right now, and it's a phenomenal thing to watch. It's a phenomenal thing to be a part of. His teammates, we're all just kind of along for the ride."</p>
      <p>In Los Angeles, Paul George scored 17 points against his former team as the Clippers eked out a nail-biting 90-88 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>
      <p>Montrezl Harrell was the star for the Clippers with 28 points off the bench in a hard-fought contest that went right down to the buzzer.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere Monday, Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with a 33-point haul as the Milwaukee Bucks outgunned the Chicago Bulls 115-101.</p>
      <p>Antetokounmpo's points tally was matched by impressive defensive numbers, with the Greek star pulling down 10 rebounds, forcing eight turnovers and making three steals.</p>
      <p>Brook Lopez had 19 points while Donte DiVincenzo added 15 for the Bucks, who improved to 10-3 in the Eastern Conference standings.</p>
      <p>In Toronto, O.G. Anunoby and Pascal Siakam sparked the Raptors in a 132-96 demolition of the Charlotte Hornets.</p>
      <p>Anunoby had 24 points and Siakam 20 as seven Toronto players finished in double figures against an outclassed Charlotte team.</p>
      <p>The Boston Celtics remain on top of the Eastern Conference table after grinding out a 99-85 win over the Phoenix Suns.</p>
      <p>Jayson Tatum had 26 points and Kemba Walker 19 as the Celtics improved to 11-2.</p>
