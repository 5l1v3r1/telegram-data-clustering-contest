      <h1>Bitcoin Will Enter New Bullish Cycle in March 2020, Analysts Confirm</h1>

        <b>China anti-cryptocurrency FUD is sending BTC into a slump as it enters its third week of sell-offs. Don’t worry though, says skewAnalytics, Bitcoin will be bullish long term next year.</b>

      <h3>Bitcoin Will Be Bullish Long Term</h3>
      <p>The bears appear to be firmly in control at the moment as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/chinese-govt-reaffirms-blockchain-not-crypto-stance/">China’s clampdown</a> on cryptocurrencies spurs further sell-offs. </p>
      <p>Just as Xi Jinping’s endorsement for blockchain technology unwittingly caused a buying frenzy, the speed with which the Chinese president is scrambling to correct that is having the reverse effect.</p>
      <p>Binance and Tron were kicked off of Weibo last week and the authorities are calling for a ‘clean up’ of cryptocurrency companies.</p>
      <p>Local government agencies, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-18/binance-tron-comment-on-weibo-bans-amid-china-crypto-crackdown">according</a> to <i>Bloomberg</i>, have been ordered to cease all dealings with cryptocurrency companies as well.</p>
      <p>It’s not all doom and gloom though (at least, not for the coming year) according to blockchain analysts, skewAnalytics.</p>
      <p>Skew reminds us of the dismal November of 2018 in which the market saw a 50% sell-off–and predicts a bearish end to this November as well, followed by a neutral year-end.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin will be bullish long term, though, entering a new cycle from March 2020. </p>

      <h3>SFOX Volatility Report Confirms Bullish Outlook</h3>
      <p>Crypto-assets dealer, SFOX, released its monthly <a href="https://blog.sfox.com/crypto-volatility-november-2019-china-facebook-libra-whales-holidays-futures-3825392ebed0">crypto volatility report</a> last Friday. In it, they confirm a bullish outlook for bitcoin; but they believe the upward trend is coming sooner.</p>
      <p>The SFOX multi-factor market index has shifted from “neutral” to “mildly bullish” for the rest of the month.</p>
      <p>Among the reasons behind the optimism are new regulatory clarity in Hong Kong, bitcoin mining IPOs in the U.S, and a plethora of institutional investment products pointing to development in the space ramping up. They conclude:</p>
      <blockquote>Whale movements and increased futures trading have set the tone for the months that have historically had the most volatile crypto movements.</blockquote>
      <p>Whichever analysis you prefer, at least you can unclench your jaw just a little. Even if we do have a bearish end to the month, at least bitcoin will be bullish long term.</p>
