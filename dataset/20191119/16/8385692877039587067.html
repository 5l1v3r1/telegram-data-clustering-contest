      <p>Amazon's latest hardware product is the Fire TV Blaster. Priced at $34.99, the Amazon Fire TV Blaster improves IR control for an existing setup.</p>
      <p>Unlike other Amazon Fire TV devices, the Amazon IR blaster requires another Fire TV device.</p>
      <p>Once added to a setup, the Fire TV Blaster expands Alexa's ability to control more devices.</p>

      <h3>Alexa, be my IR blaster</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/amazon">Amazon's</a> new Fire TV Blaster connects to an existing Fire TV device and improves Alexa's ability to <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/09/general-motors-amazon-alexa-chevrolet-cadillac-gmc-buick.html">control other devices</a>.</p>
      <p>For example, the Fire TV Blaster can be used to control a soundbar, cable or satellite box, or the TV itself. Basically, anything with infrared remote control support.</p>
      <p>Some of the actions the Fire TV Blaster assists with is controlling the volume on devices, changing channels, or switching HDMI inputs.</p>

      <p>If you already own a <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/09/new-amazon-fire-tv-cube-2019.html">Fire TV Cube</a>, then this isn't the device for you. The Fire TV Cube comes with IR blaster functionality included, negating the need for this additional companion device.</p>
      <p>The Fire TV Blaster simply allows owners of existing Amazon hardware the option to get the same benefits offered by the Fire TV Cube without having to upgrade to the $119 Cube.</p>
      <p>Compatible Fire TV devices include Fire TV (3rd Gen), Fire TV Stick 4K, and the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The Fire TV Blaster costs $34.99 per month and is not due to go on general sale until December 11. In the meantime, it is now <a href="https://geni.us/mxHXK">available to pre-order from Amazon</a>.</p>
      <h3>How to use Amazon's all-new Fire TV Blaster</h3>
      <p>The biggest hurdle with the new Amazon IR blaster is that you already need to be invested in Amazon's ecosystem. For example, not only do you need to own a Fire TV device, but also an Alexa-enabled smart speaker, such as an Echo speaker. Alternatively, an Alexa-enabled smart display.</p>
      <p>The reason for this is the Fire TV Blaster does not come with a built-in speaker or microphone. For example, the Fire TV device is needed to actually control the additional devices connected to a TV. Likewise, the Echo speaker or display is what will provide the verbal feedback from Alexa. The Fire TV Blaster simply acts as a go-between for the two.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>With all devices correct and present, the user needs to download the Fire TV app on a smartphone and then use the app to link the Fire TV Blaster to the Fire TV and Echo devices.</p>
      <p>Following which, voice commands can then be given to control additional IR devices.</p>
