      <p>Self-described “bad boy of Brexit” Arron Banks has had his Twitter account hacked and his personal messages shared online.</p>

      <p>Banks has reported the matter to police and his account has now reportedly been suspended.</p>
      <p>“I became aware last night that my Twtter account had been ahcked and that persons involved have posted personal data obtained illegally via Twitter,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Twitter were notified 12 hours ago, and despite repeated requests they have taken no action to deactiviate the account or remove the illegal data downloads.</p>
      <p>“Despite the obvious lack of security at Twitter relating to personal data, they have deliberately chosen to leave personal data in the public domain.”</p>
      <p>Twitter were contacted for comment on Banks’ allegations.</p>
      <p>Direct messages from Banks’ account were posted online by the hackers, however they have since been removed.</p>
      <p>Journalist Carole Cadwalladr posted on Twitter that she had seen the messages and they were “pretty explosive”.</p>
      <p>Cadwalladr added that the incident was a chance for Banks to “reflect” on data privacy laws, after he was fined £120,000 by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) this year for breaching them.</p>
      <p>“Arron Banks has shown extraordinary contempt for the ICO and British data laws and so this is a moment for him to reflect on the need for those laws and a regulator to enforce them,” she said.</p>
      <p>The saga comes as it was revealed today that the Brexit Party was being investigated by the ICO for failing to disclose details of personal data it had collected.</p>
