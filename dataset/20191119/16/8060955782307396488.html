      <p>LIVERPOOL, N.S. -- A Nova Scotia artist is woodworking her way to the silver screen after her Christmas creations were featured in a Hallmark movie this holiday season.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Brown took her first woodcarving lesson almost 27 years ago, and she hasn’t put her knife down since.</p>
      <p>“As soon as I heard the sound of a sharp tool going through the wood I was hooked,” says Brown, who lives and works in Liverpool, N.S.</p>
      <p>Brown says she’s thankful she gets to make a living by doing what she loves.</p>
      <p>“Years ago, I remember wishing for myself as a very young person that I could work for myself doing something creative, but I wasn’t sure what that could be, she says. “Five years ago, it just dawned on me that I was doing exactly that, and I am so grateful.”</p>
      <p>Brown’s handmade and painted wooden Santas have become her signature pieces -- no two are the same.</p>
      <p>“Lots of people have collected them and I’m thankful for all of them and it’s one of the staples of my business,” she says.</p>
      <p>Brown says she probably carves between 100 and 150 Santas every year.</p>
      <p>While they have long been a favourite with her customers, they also recently caught the eye of the Hallmark Channel, which produces dozens of made-for-TV Christmas movies every year.</p>
      <p>Brown says the man in charge of props for the Hallmark Channel also happens to be from Nova Scotia and he stumbled across her work.</p>
      <p>“They had gone over a few different styles and decided that mine was the one they wanted, so he contacted me through Facebook,” she recalls. “I thought maybe I was being punked, but it turned out he was legit.”</p>
      <p>The movie, “Nostalgic Christmas,” focuses on an ambitious New York City toy buyer. When her father retires from his woodcarving career, she returns to her small-town roots to run the family’s beloved toy store.</p>
      <p>“It was exciting to read the script and see how big a role that these Santas played in the movie,” says Brown.</p>
      <p>While Brown was thrilled to have her work featured in a Hallmark Christmas movie, it also meant a mad scramble for the artist, as she had just two weeks to create 24 new Santas for the film.</p>
      <p>“Each Santa has specific little accessories because they all have a theme, so each one had to have, I designed them to match the script basically, so it was a bit tight.”</p>
      <p>Brown admits she had never actually watched a Hallmark movie, so she wasn’t aware of how popular they are. She was stunned when she learned the movies can garner 72 million viewers.</p>
      <p>“That’s where my knees went a little weak and I got a little nervous,” she says.</p>
      <p>While seeing her work in a movie was thrilling enough, Brown says the experience has also led to a big boost in business.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had such positive responses from people from the States, I’ve been sending them all over the United States, the U.K., people sending me messages, when can I get one of your Santas?”</p>
      <p>As for customers wanting to start their own collection, Brown says she is currently sold out of Santas, but is carving as quickly as she can.</p>
