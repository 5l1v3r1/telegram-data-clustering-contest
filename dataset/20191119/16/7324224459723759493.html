      <p>Saracens have been hit with another fine a day after they agreed not to appeal against a £5.36million punishment for salary-cap breaches.</p>
      <p>Sarries have been penalised for breaching the 2019-20 Heineken Champions Cup participation agreement by not making required club representatives available for a key European Professional Club Rugby promotional event.</p>
      <p>EPCR has fined the reigning Heineken Champions Cup holders an undisclosed sum, and confirmed it has already been paid by the club.</p>

      <p>Saracens on Monday agreed “with humility” to accept a 35-point deduction and significant fine for breaches across a three-season period, up to and including the 2018-19 campaign, following a nine-month investigation by Premiership Rugby.</p>
      <p>This latest episode adds to Saracens’ ongoing embarrassment.</p>
      <p>Director of rugby Mark McCall and captain Brad Barritt had been scheduled to attend the official season launch of the 2019-20 Champions Cup and Challenge Cup for Premiership and PRO14 clubs, staged at Cardiff’s Principality Stadium on November 6.</p>
      <p>But an EPCR statement read: “Having previously indicated that they would be represented at the event, Saracens’ failure to attend constituted a breach of the 2019-20 Heineken Champions Cup media rules, and compromised EPCR’s ability to deliver the rights contracted to its broadcast, commercial and media partners.”</p>

      <p>The statement added: “In light of this breach of its rules, EPCR has decided to impose a fine on Saracens which has been paid by the club, and the sum of which will remain undisclosed.</p>
      <p>“EPCR appreciates the subsequent efforts made by Saracens to grant rights-holding broadcasters special interview access to members of their Heineken Champions Cup squad in the week before the start of the tournament.”</p>
      <p>The club – 26 points adrift at the foot of the Premiership on -22points – began their Champions Cup defence with a comprehensive 30-10 defeat at Racing 92 on Sunday.</p>
