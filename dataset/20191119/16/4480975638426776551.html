      <h1>Fed's Williams: Fed has to make sure it is not overreacting to individual data points</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:20:22+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>The Federal Reserve has to make sure that it is not overreacting to individual data points over the coming months, New York Federal Reserve President John Williams told reporters at a capital markets conference in Washington on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"The fact reserve levels are higher than the Fed was expecting does not change the calculus on <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">monetary policy</a>," Williams added. "If inflation were to move in the wrong direction on a sustained basis, that could cause the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed">Fed</a> to become more accommodative. The most important tools for financial stability are existing ones."</p>
      <p>The US Dollar Index ignored these comments and was last moving sideways near 97.80, where it was virtually unchanged on a daily basis.</p>
