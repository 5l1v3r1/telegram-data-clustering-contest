      <p>Parts of Dundalk may be without water until 10pm tonight due to repairs to a burst water main, say Irish Water.</p>
      <p>Irish Water have announced this afternoon that repairs to a burst water main may cause supply disruptions to New Street, Broughton Street and surrounding areas in Dundalk.</p>
      <p>A traffic management plan will be in place for the duration of these works, which have an estimated completion time of 10pm tonight.</p>
      <p>Irish Water say the supply may take 2-3 hours to fully return to all affected properties.</p>
