      <p>A brand new trailer for Darksiders Genesis has been released by Airship Syndicate and THQ Nordic which shows the abilities and a system called creature cores. Players can play either as War or Strife through the campaign in the game and each has different abilities. As enemies are killed creature cores are dropped which allows for both characters to unlock new abilities including spawning hellhounds, increasing attack power, and adding lava trails to weapons.</p>

      <p>Darksiders Genesis is the first game in the series that allows for co-op as players can work together with Strife and War. Both characters have special attacks which turns the characters temporarily into larger creatures that deal more damage. The story itself is set before the events of the first Darksiders game so the apocalypse hasnâ€™t been triggered just yet.</p>
      <p>Darksiders Genesis will be available on December 5th for PC and Google Stadia, while a console release will follow on February 14th, 2020.</p>
