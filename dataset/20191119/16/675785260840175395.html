      <h1>Cats movie releases a new trailer and people are still terrified</h1>
      <h2>The Cats movie from Tom Hopper may have an all-star cast including Taylor Swift, Judi Dench, and Idris Elba, but the reaction online is one of fear</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:56:30+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:56</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>We finally have a new trailer for the new take on classic musical Cats.</p>
      <p>Oscar-winning The King's Speech director <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ton-hooper">Tom Hooper</a> adapts <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/andrew-lloyd-webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber's</a> record-shattering stage musical into a glossy - and special effects-filled - film event.</p>
      <p>The cast of the film includes the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jennifer-hudson">Jennifer Hudson</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/james-corden">James Corden</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/judi-dench">Dame Judi Dench</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jason-derulo">Jason Derulo</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/idris-elba">Idris Elba</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ian-mckellen">Sir Ian McKellen</a> , pop star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rebel-wilson">Rebel Wilson</a> and screen newcomer and Royal Ballet principal dancer Francesca Hayward.</p>
      <p>Featuring Lloyd Webber’s iconic music and a world-class cast of dancers under the guidance of Tony-winning choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler (Hamilton), the film offers dance styles ranging from classical ballet to contemporary, hip-hop to jazz, street dance to tap.</p>
      <p>However, the appearance of the cast as cats is continuing to be the talk of social media.</p>

      <p>One person wrote on Twitter:  "Whelp. In case you were all wondering, the new <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Cats">#Cats</a> still creeps me the f' out. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CatsMovie">#CatsMovie</a> "</p>
      <p>Another noted: "WHY DO THEY ALL HAVE HANDS AND FEET <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CatsMovie">#CatsMovie</a> "</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, one user needs help: "can someone please come over and put the parental block on the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CatsMovie">#CatsMovie</a> trailer, I have so much work to do"</p>
      <p>One brutally tweeted: "The new trailer fot <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CatsMovie">#CatsMovie</a> isn't so bad if you close your eyes."</p>
      <p>Finally, one fan is realistic but hopeful: "You know what? I don’t care that the CGI is kinda creepy or that it probably can’t live up to the original show or any other complaint everyone’s been making. It looks fun and I’m excited!!!!!! <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CatsMovie">#CatsMovie</a> "</p>
      <p>What do you guys think?</p>
