      <h3>Germany vs Northern Ireland match preview</h3>
      <p>Northern Ireland manager Michael O’Neill has billed the game the perfect preparation for the European Championships, should his side reach the finals. They will go into a play-off round in March.</p>
      <p>Germany aren’t without their weaknesses at the moment, despite the fact they’ve qualified, as Joachim Low attempts to bring through a new generation of talent. In their last meaningful competitive match they drew 2-2 with Argentina, throwing away a 2-0 lead. Back in September they lost 4-2 at home to the Netherlands, in a performance that disappointed fans and pundits alike.</p>
      <p>Joachim Low famously ejected Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng from his Germany side following the team’s horrific World Cup showing. Now though, the team is severely lacking in central defence and has been found out numerous times since, leaking more goals than German fans are accustomed to.</p>
      <p>Will Northern Ireland be able to take advantage of this? They’re better known for their gritty defensive capabilities and their backline, led by Leicester stalwart, Jonny Evans.</p>
      <p>Last time out they impressively prevented a free-flowing Netherlands side from scoring, but the 0-0 draw in Belfast didn’t exactly showcase Northern Ireland’s attacking capabilities. However, it did show that the current team can go toe-to-toe with more highly ranked sides.</p>
      <p>When Northern Ireland faced Germany back in September they suffered a 2-0 home defeat. It’s hard to see them reversing things tonight but they have never been a team to write off and some great talents will be on show, despite the low stakes nature of the game.</p>
