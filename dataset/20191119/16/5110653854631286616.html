      <p>Montreal Canadiens forward<a href="https://www.nhl.com/canadiens/news/medical-update---jonathan-drouin---november-19/c-311490856?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=CHCcontent&amp;utm_content=EN-1119-Drouin">Jonathan Drouin underwent successful wrist surgery</a>on Monday and will be out for a minimum of eight weeks, it was announced on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The team had <a href="https://twitter.com/CanadiensMTL/status/1195782964094947331">placed Drouin on injured reserve</a>on Saturday and said the 24-year-oldsustained the injuryduring the third period of Friday's 5-2 win over the Washington Capitals.</p>
      <p>Drouin took a huge open-ice hit from Alex Ovechkin in the second period of that game,<a href="http://twitter.com/EricEngels/status/1195789818451701761">but</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/EricEngels/status/1195789818451701761">the team claims Drouin suffered the wrist injury</a> after he had returned from concussion protocol.</p>

      <p>Drouin's loss serves a huge blow to a Montreal team that finds itself second in the Atlantic Division through Nov. 18; his15 points in 19 games played had put him on pace for a 64-point season, which would serve asa career-high.The forwardentered Friday's game tied for the team's overall scoring lead with Tomas Tatar, who scored four points against the Capitals.</p>
      <p>The Canadiens also announced that <a href="https://www.nhl.com/canadiens/news/medical-update---paul-byron---november-19/c-311491498?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=CHCcontent&amp;utm_content=EN-1119-Byron">alternate captainÂ Paul Byron underwent knee surgery on Tuesday</a>and is expected to miss four weeks.Byron's injury appears to stem from a collision with Washington's Richard Panik in that same game. The 30-year-old forwarddid not play in Saturday's contest against the New Jersey Devils.</p>
