        <b>Framlingham College have apologised after a student doctored an image of a banner commemorating Britain's war heroes with a swastika before it was shared online.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The banner, depicting the silhouette of a soldier, was altered to include the Nazi symbol by a student.</p>
      <p>The image was then shared with another student, who posted it on social media.</p>
      <p>Framlingham College said the pair were immediately suspended as a result of the incident.</p>
      <p>Louise North, principal of the college, said: "I apologise unreservedly for the offence caused by the behaviour of these pupils, which contradicts in the strongest terms the ethos of this school.</p>
      <p>"The Framlingham College community has the most profound respect for the nation's servicemen and women, our veterans and the fallen.</p>
      <p>"Every year, the college reflects on the huge sacrifice made by those who have served and those who have fallen, through chapel addresses, classroom discussion, external speakers and charitable undertaking.</p>
      <p>"This year was no different, which makes the aberrant behaviour of these pupils all the more deplorable.</p>
      <p>"In both cases, their actions were completely out of character and both are full of remorse."</p>
