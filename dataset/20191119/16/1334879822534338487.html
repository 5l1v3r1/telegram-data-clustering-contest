      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:00:32+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Leon Ho</a></address>
      <p>Over the years, education was restricted to the four walls of the classroom with a boring learning routine and sitting positions that are not ergonomic.</p>
      <p>Joe Nemo, in Inc magazine, classified online learning as a $107 billion industry that nobody is talking about. He also affirms that teaching is lucrative, which establishes the belief that the e-learning sector will continue to evolve.<a href="https://www.lifehack.org/856820/online-learning-effective#footnote_plugin_tooltip_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
      <p>So, what is online learning?</p>
      <p>It is a teaching-learning platform that enables students to enroll and participate in courses via the internet. It does not require being present in the physical classrooms. They can join from any location as long as they are connected to the internet. Not only that, online learning is an excellent way for subject matter professionals and experts to pass on their skills, aptitudes, and knowledge in an impactful way.</p>
      <p>Here’s why online learning is more beneficial:</p>
      <h3>1. Enhance Your Professional Skills</h3>
      <p>Online learning is a vital means of updating your skills, knowledge, and attitudes. In a fast competitive world, you need to go through a learning experience that is tailored to meet global demand. Freelancers and experience employees leverage <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/813613/online-learning">online learning to enhance their career progression</a> and cultivate highly-demanded skills in the marketplace.</p>
      <h3>2. Improve Your Productivity</h3>
      <p>Learning equals earning. It is often said that you will need to learn first, then remove the ‘L’. This is true at both the personal and organizational levels.</p>
      <p>Individuals who invest in <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/791279/lifelong-learning">lifelong learning</a> and training development will always see a significant improvement in their productivity. <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/294651/10-free-online-courses-make-you-more-successful">Several courses </a>are available online to assist you in achieving peak performance in your personal life and at work.</p>
      <h3>3. Enjoy Diverse Means of Communicating with Instructors</h3>
      <p>The flexibility that online learning provides over traditional methods of education makes it possible to communicate with instructors.</p>
      <p>Technology simplifies these communication processes via live chat, email, as well as telephone conversations. You can also get feedback or engage in a Q&amp;A session with a college professor. What an exciting way to network!</p>
      <h3>4. Save Time and Cost</h3>
      <p>Online learning is budget-friendly. You can search for courses that align with your objectives and budget. The traditional costs of education are expensive. As long as you can log into your course dashboard when you want to, you can save some money to pursue other ambitions.</p>
      <h3>5. Customize Your Learning Experience</h3>
      <p>Online learning affords you the privilege of customizing your learning environment. You can learn while commuting, in your house, at a friend’s house, or even set up your ideal classroom and complete your homework assignments.</p>
      <p>It will assist you in focusing on your academic objectives as it eliminates irrelevant distractions, which are common occurrences in a traditional learning environment.</p>
      <h3>6. Enjoy a Flexible Schedule</h3>
      <p>A significant benefit of learning online is flexibility. You have the privilege of engaging in some other rewarding activities. You can care for your family, work full-time, and earn a certification or degree. You can set academic goals on how many courses you want to take next year now.</p>
      <p>Planning will help you to incorporate your learning goals to align with other schedules better.</p>
      <h3>7. Participate in Virtual Study Sessions</h3>
      <p>Learning requires active involvement and engagement. An optimum classroom design relies on the engagement level and the ability of each student to support the other and be civil in the process.</p>
      <p>Some virtual instructors call it ‘contribution’. You can participate in virtual study sessions via discussion boards, assignments, seminars, chats, blogs, office hours, and the Q&amp;A sessions.</p>
      <p>You can as well present documents, utilize whiteboards during brainstorming sessions and share your screen as long as you have a computer, an internet connection, and a headset. Learning online is now easier!</p>
      <h3>8. Review Course Materials Easily</h3>
      <p>You can access your course dashboard, which contains articles, podcasts, videos, and written documents any time you want.</p>
      <p>Online learning makes it possible to scroll through the pages, utilize the find button, and take some online notes to understand the materials better.</p>
      <h3>9. Learn at Your Pace</h3>
      <p>Researchers at Suny Albany found that class attendance has a significant relationship with student success.<a href="https://www.lifehack.org/856820/online-learning-effective#footnote_plugin_tooltip_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
      <p>If you are losing the drive to keep up with your colleagues, online learning provides you a means of knocking out some courses in no time. You can grasp each concept and theory as you have the opportunity to watch videos over and over again without disturbing the instructor. You determine your progress as you control your learning pathway.</p>
      <h3>10. Develop Self-Discipline</h3>
      <p>Online learning will compel you to develop self-discipline skills such as time management and project management.</p>
      <p>You can leverage time management tools to schedule your time and activities using an online calendar. These lifelong skills will impact every aspect of your life.</p>
      <h3>11. Be Evaluated Immediately</h3>
      <p>Waiting to obtain your examination scores in a traditional setting is annoying and nerve-racking. The online learning framework provides an instant scoring mechanism that intimates you with your scores having completed the online tests and quizzes.</p>
      <h3>12. Learn for Free</h3>
      <p>Yes! You can learn for free through your local library on <a href="https://www.lynda.com/">Lynda</a>. Lynda.com is a learning platform that was purchased by LinkedIn in 2015. You only need a library card to access the library- no subscription is required.<a href="https://www.lifehack.org/856820/online-learning-effective#footnote_plugin_tooltip_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
      <h3>13. Protect the Environment</h3>
      <p>Online learning minimizes the negative impact on the environment, which emanates from transportation and manufacturing. The infrastructure and the materials required in the traditional education establishments(buildings, desks, electricity, textbooks) are significantly reduced. This goes a long way in conserving natural resources.</p>
      <p>Not only that, various academic institutions can save both time and money when they implement and expand their online learning platforms.</p>
      <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>Online learning will gain more popularity over the traditional means of education because of its flexibility and convenience.</p>
