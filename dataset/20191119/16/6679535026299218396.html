      <h1>CSB Bank to raise ₹410 cr. via IPO</h1>
      <h2>Offer opens on Nov. 22 and priced at ₹193-195 a share</h2>

      <p>Thrissur-based old generation private lender CSB Bank — earlier known as Catholic Syrian Bank — has set a price band of ₹193-195 per share for its initial public offer (IPO), valuing the bank at ₹3,400 crore. The IPO opens on November 22 and closes on November 26.</p>
      <p>The IPO consists of fresh issue up to ₹24 crore and an offer for sale of up to 1,97,78,298 equity shares.</p>
      <p>Three insurance companies — HDFC Life, ICICI Prudential and Edelweiss Tokyo Life Insurance Company, which have stake in the bank — will exit following the IPO. The book running lead managers to the offer are Axis Capital Limited and IIFL Securities Limited.</p>
      <p>Indo-Canadian billionaire businessman Prem Watsa’s Fairfax India, which has 50.09% stake in the bank, will see its stake falling to 49.74% post the IPO, C.V.R. Rajendran, MD &amp; CEO, CSB Bank, told reporters.</p>
      <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has given promoters a 15-year-time period to reduce stake to 15%. Promoters will have 5 years to reduce stake to 40%, 10 years to reduce stake to 30% and 15 years for bringing it down to 15%. The bank is going for the IPO mainly to meet regulatory requirements.</p>
      <p>RBI had asked the lender to list by September but there was a delay due to procedural issues. The bank reported ₹44 crore profit for the half-year ended September 2019 as compared with a ₹197 crore loss for the full financial year 2018-19. While the loan book of the bank is at ₹11,500 crore its deposit base is ₹15,000 crore, 25% of which is from NRIs. Mr. Rajendran said the bank was going slow on deposits as the bank had surplus liquidity.</p>
      <p>CSB Bank has a strong base in Kerala along with significant presence in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Maharashtra with customer base of 1.3 million as on March 31, 2019.</p>
      <p>The bank plans to add 425 branches over the next five years.</p>
