        <b>The double album comes out this Friday</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/coldplay">Coldplay</a> have already set their sights on the follow-up to their forthcoming album ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/coldplay-tease-new-double-album-mysterious-letter-fans-2559182">Everyday Life</a>‘, according to their label.</p>
      <p>Chris Martin and co. are set to release the double-disc follow-up to 2015’s ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-coldplay-16355">A Head Full Of Dreams</a>‘ this Friday (November 22). The project has been previewed with <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-coldplay-debut-new-track-everyday-life-snl-2564026">its title track</a> along with ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/coldplay-orphans-arabesque-track-reviews-2560714">Orphans’ and ‘Arabesque</a>’.</p>

      <p>Ahead of the LP’s arrival, Mark Mitchell – co-president of Coldplay’s record label Parlophone – has suggested that another full-length from the band could be in the works sooner rather than later.</p>
      <p>“There’s nothing set in stone, but what we can say is there’s a desire to do another record to follow this up quickly,” he told <a href="https://www.musicweek.com/media/read/new-edition-of-music-week-out-now/078095"><i>Music Week</i></a>.</p>

      <p>“[‘Everyday Life’] came very, very quickly. They worked on tracks for the rest of the summer, so there’s a lot of ideas left off this record which they’re hoping to follow up as soon as possible.”</p>
      <p>Discussing whether this next studio effort could be linked to ‘Everyday Life’, Parlophone co-president Nick Burgess added: “I don’t think they are sister records. This is very much a record that the band had to get out of their system.”</p>
      <p>Coldplay will celebrate the arrival of their new album <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/coldplay-announce-intimate-last-minute-gig-londons-natural-history-museum-2568977">with a special show at London’s Natural History Museum next Monday</a> (November 25). The event will follow <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/coldplay-to-launch-everyday-life-with-two-live-streamed-gigs-in-jordan-2563688">the band’s two performances in Jordan this Friday</a>, where they’ll launch ‘Everyday Life’ by playing the record in its entirety.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, frontman Martin has <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/coldplay-confirm-not-playing-glastonbury-next-year-2567496">confirmed that Coldplay will not be playing</a> <a href="https://www.nme.com/tags/glastonbury">Glastonbury</a> in 2020 amid rumours of a possible return to Worthy Farm.</p>
