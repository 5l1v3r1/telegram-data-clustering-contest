      <h1>Senior Conservative says Welsh party 'tried to delay' investigation into Ross England until after the General Election</h1>
      <h2>Lee Canning has quit the party after 17 years and says the top of the party in Wales needs a "clear out"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:24:25+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:24</time> by <a rel="author">Ruth Mosalski</a></address>
      <p>A senior Welsh Conservative figure has said he was in a meeting where the party chairman tried to bury the results of an investigation into candidate Ross England until after the election.</p>
      <p>Lee Canning has quit as deputy chairman of the Welsh Conservatives after alleging the party's Welsh chairman Byron Davies "wanted to put a stop to" the investigation into Mr England.</p>
      <p>Responding to the allegations, Mr Davies said Mr Canning "at no time tried to raise the Ross England issue with me as quoted", and described his former colleague as a "disgruntled failed Conservative candidate".</p>
      <p>Mr Canning had been a Conservative party candidate for 17 years and been the deputy chairman of the Welsh Conservatives for the last 18 months.</p>
      <p>He has now left the party and joined the Abolish the Assembly Party.</p>
      <p>There are a combination of reasons, he said, but a key one was the handling of the allegations into Mr England by the party leadership.</p>
      <p>Mr England was suspended as the Vale of Glamorgan Assembly candidate because of comments from a judge that <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/rape-trial-deliberately-sabotaged-conservative-17166210">he sabotaged a rape trial.</a></p>
      <p>The party has faced repeated questions about what it knew about the issue, and when it knew them.</p>
      <p>There have also been questions of <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/alun-cairns">Alun Cairns</a> , who is standing again to be the Vale of Glamorgan MP for the party, who was Mr England's former employee.</p>
      <p>An investigation into Mr England's conduct is ongoing and the Welsh party say it will take "some time".</p>
      <p>Mr Canning says he was at a meeting of the Welsh management board on November 8 which had a single agenda item - to discuss the approach to the General Election.</p>
      <p>Instead, Mr England's conduct, and his former employer Alun Cairns took up most of the time. He says that the Welsh chairman, Byron Davies, asked for no minutes to be taken, despite that being the usual practice and there being someone there whose job was to do so. Asked why, Mr Canning said it was to ensure there was no "paper trail".</p>

      <p>"At that meeting, I was pushing for an investigation to be conducted immediately and to be concluded because we, as a party, didn't want it to be overshadowing the election.</p>
      <p>"It needed to be remedied.</p>
      <p>"The chairman wanted to put a stop to it and he said in a few weeks time it will be forgotten about."</p>
      <p>He said Mr Davies was "trying to put it off until after the election". Mr Canning says he knew Mr England "before politics".</p>
      <p>"What he has done is not tasteful at all.</p>
      <p>"It's something that I couldn't and wouldn't support and I think that to sabotage a rape trial is pretty low.</p>
      <p>"But it's one of those things that should have been looked at and who knew about it and who didn't think it was relevant."</p>
      <p>He said that as Mr England was both an Assembly candidate and paid Conservative member of staff as campaign manager for the Vale of Glamorgan and the Rhondda, it should have been looked at.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't matter who employed him, he was still Alun Cairns' running mate and was still the campaign manager for the Vale of Glamorgan."If he was Secretary of State, then the Secretary of State should have known who is running his campaign."</p>
      <p>Mr Canning said that at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester in September, a meeting was held where he tried to address discipline in the party, including other examples from Mr England."I was aware of instances where he's been a little bit unsavoury".</p>
      <p>Mr Canning admits he was looked over as a candidate for the snap election over online comments in 2012.</p>
      <p>He said comments came to light where he called a female friend a "slag"."I know some people don't like the word slag but it was between friends. She's a family now, I have and we exchange gifts.""I was barred because of that but it's come to light that other candidates have said worse things."</p>
      <p>But he says that is part of a wider reason.</p>
      <p>He said other candidates have been parachuted into seats in a "tick box" exercise.</p>
      <p>Comments made public by the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/benefits-street-conservative-comments-gower-17197393">Gower candidates Francesca O'Brien</a> and <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/chris-davies-stand-general-election-17247088">Chris Davies being imposed as Anglesey candidate</a> before dropping out of the race, were examples of mismanagement by the party, he said.</p>
      <p>Chris Davies was selected by his local constituency group as candidate for the by-election in August but his selection in Anglesey was made by the central party.</p>
      <p>"Ynys Mon was advertised weeks before and we had candidates for that seat and they should have been given due process and say why they deserved to be the candidate but instead it was someone convicted of fraud because it's institutionalised and the attitude "he was a good mate of mine".</p>
      <p>"I am concerned that the leadership under the current chairman is getting less Conservative.</p>
      <p>"What you need in the higher tiers of the Conservatives in Wales is a clear out. We have got Byron for one who I believe is out of touch."</p>
      <p>He said that the party has divided over candidate selection issues, the next steps for devolution, specific incidents but also Brexit.</p>
      <p>"I think we need to move away from the referendum but when you step back and look at <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/somali-boy-who-fled-civil-16649202">Cardiff North</a> , <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/brecon-radnorshire-election-who-candidates-16476883">Brecon and Radnorshire</a> and Aberconwy, they are target seats and they all have remainers but they're billed as the next generation of MPs."</p>
      <p>In response to his comments, Lord Davies of Gower, said: â€œLee Canning is a disgruntled failed Conservative candidate, and I am saddened that he has taken to the media to vent his frustration.</p>
      <p>"At no time did Lee Canning try to raise the Ross England issue with me as quoted."</p>
      <p>Asked when the hearing for Mr England is due to be held, he continued: "As has been widely reported, the matter is now the subject of a full investigation which will take some time and we will not be commenting further on it."</p>
      <p>The cabinet office has been asked for an update into a separate inquiry into Alun Cairns and said there is no further update since <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/alun-cairns-resigns-rape-trial-17209908">he resigned as Secretary of State on November 6.</a></p>
