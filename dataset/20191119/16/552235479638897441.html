      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:48:38+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:48</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Clark, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/rachel-clark/</a></address>
      <p>Makers and artists from across Perthshire are showing their wares at a design market.</p>
      <p>Perthshire Creates’ annual Christmas Design Market will return to the Civic Hall in Perth’s 2 High Street on Saturday, November 23 and Sunday, November 24.</p>
      <p>Over 50 different makers will have stalls, including 24 brand new artists.</p>
      <p>The work on sale is hugely varied, featuring original designs and handcrafts, helping to keep Christmas shopping local and support independent makers in the region.</p>
      <p>Jenna McDonald, a jeweller from Crieff, has been taking part in the Christmas Design Market since it began in 2015.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s a joy to exhibit in my home town alongside so many talented local artisans.</p>
      <p>“As a maker, I love having the opportunity to get out of my studio to meet new and existing customers, chatting about my jewellery making workshops (which I will be hosting from my new studio space within the Perth Creative Exchange from early next year), and catching up with other stallholders.”</p>
      <p>There will be a range of crafts on offer at the market, including glass, prints, textiles, paintings, ceramics, woodwork and contemporary crafts.</p>

      <p>Perth-based jewellery Diana King said: “As a stallholder with the Perthshire Creates Design Market, I can rest assured that the overall feel of the design market is one of the quality products lovingly handmade to the highest standard.</p>
      <p>“The location of the Civic Hall is a beautiful space to set up the market, it has great natural and artificial lighting to enhance displays and plenty of room for visitors to browse and stroll around.</p>
      <p>“It is perfect for welcoming new and existing customers visiting the city centre and enjoying the market’s riverside location.</p>
      <p>“I love to use markets and fairs to meet my customers, bringing the shopping experience back to how it should be, face-to-face with a person.”</p>
      <p>John Bishop from The Grey Earl in Comrie is exhibiting at the design market for the first time this year.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m hugely excited. Having met some of the other makers and artists throughout the year, I am excited to be sharing a platform with some really talented creatives.</p>

      <p>“It feels like a very supportive creative community which the Perthshire Creates team represent, all coming together at this year’s Christmas Design Market.</p>
      <p>“Also, it’s an opportunity for me to do some festive shopping whilst supporting other local independent businesses.”</p>
      <p>The Christmas Design Market will be open from 10am until 4.30pm on both Saturday, November 23 and Sunday, November 24 in the Civic Hall.</p>
      <p>Entry is free, although there is a suggested donation of £1 to Culture Perth and Kinross, the creative organisation behind the region’s museums, galleries and libraries.</p>
