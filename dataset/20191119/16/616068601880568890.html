      <p>The occupants of a 25-metre yacht had to abandon ship Tuesday when the vessel struck rocks in the mouth of the Fraser River off Richmond.</p>
      <p>Janice Lee with Maritime Forces Pacific says the vessel was near Steveston when it hit the rocks.</p>
      <p>The cause of the incident is unknown, and Lee says the search and rescue has been completed.</p>
      <p>She says a coast guard vessel is at the site and conducting an environmental impact assessment, although there's no indication that fuel has been spilled.</p>
      <p>She says it's not clear how many people were aboard the vessel at the time of impact.</p>
