      <h1>Prince Andrew's BBC Newsnight interview was 'one-off', producer says</h1>
      <h2>Buckingham Palace said the interview will never be repeated</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:11:14+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, Alexander Brock</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/royal-family">Prince Andrew's</a> Newsnight interview was considered as a "one-off" by Buckingham Palace, the producer has said.</p>
      <p>Sam McAlister spent a year securing the explosive sit-down, which the palace has said will never be repeated.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York discussed his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during the interview and has since faced a barrage of criticism, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/prince-andrews-bbc-newsnight-never-17281124">Birmingham Live reports</a>.</p>
      <p>McAlister told GQ magazine that such an interview is unlikely to happen again any time soon.</p>
      <p>"As far as the palace was concerned, this is not going to be done again, this interview," she said.</p>

      <p>"This is a one-off. And they wanted to ensure that there were no misunderstandings about His Royal Highness doing a candid and fair exchange.</p>
      <p>"They understood that that was what they were looking for.</p>
      <p>"To be frank, they wanted to do something that was clear, open, impartial, rigorous - and there was never any misunderstanding about what was on offer.</p>
      <p>"The extent of his openness, frankness, the length of (the duke's) answers, the generosity of the time that he spent with us ... It certainly felt a very significant and unusual situation to be in."</p>
      <p>Describing the experience, she added: "Once the cameras start rolling and you're sitting behind His Royal Highness The Duke Of York, doing his first ever interview on allegations of the type that you never expect to hear a member of the royal family speak on in your lifetime, you definitely start to feel that something momentous, of national significance, is happening.</p>
      <p>"And that was certainly my feeling when I was lucky enough to be in that room."</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew also gave members of the Newsnight team a tour of the palace after his showdown with Emily Maitlis.</p>
      <p>"The prince was extremely congenial afterwards, as he was throughout the entire process - he could not have been more generous and kind to us, particularly given the circumstances, and he showed (interviewer) Emily (Maitlis) and other members of the team around the palace," McAlister said.</p>
