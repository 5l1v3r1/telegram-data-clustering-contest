      <p>It has been quite some time already since Apple announced it was rebuilding Apple Maps from the ground up to offer more detail across the United States. The goal? A full rollout by the end of 2019.</p>
      <p>And the company continues to work on that as the year winds down. This week, Apple completed its expansion in the Midwestern and Western regions of the United States, according to great data from <a href="https://www.justinobeirne.com/new-apple-maps-midwest-west">Justin O’Beirne</a> (via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/19/apple-maps-revamp-west-midwest-united-states/"><i>MacRumors</i></a>). This latest update actually started <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/10/14/apple-maps-expansion-midwest/">back in October</a> of this year, when Apple started to rollout the enhanced Apple Maps in the Midwest.</p>
      <p>This latest expansion includes Indiana, some areas of Illinois, West Virginia, Michigan, Ohio, the state of Washington, Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Utah, Nevada, and Wyoming.</p>
      <p>Before this latest expansion, Apple Maps’ expanded data was updated to include <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/08/13/apple-maps-rollout-northeast-united-states/">Washington DC, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts and Maine</a>. Better maps from Apple are also available in <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/08/09/new-apple-maps-texas/">Texas, Louisiana, Southern Mississippi</a>, Hawaii, Southern California, <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/04/25/apple-maps-launches-detailed-terrain-features-in-arizona-new-mexico-and-nevada/">Arizona, New Mexico, and the Las Vegas</a> metropolitan area.</p>
      <p>If you’re curious to see how these expansions have rolled out since Apple kicked things off back in late 2018, O’Beirne has a fantastic rundown of what it looks like from start to current times. O’Beirne notes that this is the sixth expansion to Apple Maps, and that the more detailed dat now covers 27 states.</p>
      <p>Apple’s goal is to still have the expanded Maps data across the entire United States by the end of this year, so expect at least one more major expansion between now and then.</p>
      <p>If you live in an area with the expanded data for Apple Maps, are you liking the changes so far? Let us know in the comments.</p>
