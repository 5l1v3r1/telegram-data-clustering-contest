      <p><b>T</b>he House of Representatives Election Petitions Tribunal in Lagos State has upheld the election and re-run election of Kolawole Taiwo as the representative of  Ajeromi Ifelodun Federal Constituency.</p>
      <p>The Chairman of the three-man tribunal, Justice Hamidu Kunasa, dismissed the petition filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for the constituency, Rita Orji, challenging Taiwo’s election</p>
      <p>Taiwo is a member of the All Progressive Congress (APC).</p>
      <p>Justice Kunasa held that the basis on which Orji premised her allegations were largely invalid.</p>
      <p>He said INEC acted within the confines of constitutional frameworks in both the election of February 23, 2019 and the consequent supplementary election held on April 27, 2019.</p>
      <p>The tribunal faulted the petitioner for filing a petition at a court in Kubwa Abuja, on a post-election matter which is really a preserve of the tribunal.</p>
      <p>“The Kubwa Court’s stand is not binding on this court, we have jurisdiction”, he maintained.</p>
      <p>The tribunal also discountenanced the petitioner’s prayer to be declared winner of the said election as the grounds of argument were of no value.</p>
      <p>The tribunal absolved the first respondent ( INEC) of any involvement in corrupt practices in the conduct of the elections.</p>
      <p>According to Justice Kunasa, the Petitioner failed to prove any of the three counts. The tribunal upheld INEC’s decision that Taiwo was the validly elected member at the Federal House of Representatives for Ajeromi Ifelodun Federal constituency.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the judgment  INEC’s counsel, Mr. Tijani Ishola expressed satifaction with the tribunal’s decision.</p>
      <p>”The laws are very clear with regards to election petitions and it is the duty of any party who alleges to prove his case.</p>
      <p>”The tribunal has done justice by resolving all issues raised by the petitioner and the respondents and the beauty of election petitions in this case is that they look at the facts on ground and facts adduced by the party, so that at the end of the day, every party involved will believe strongly that Justice has been done.</p>
      <p>“In this our case, although it has taken us a long while, but we are glad that we are having the day and regardless of where the pendulum is swinging, judgment has been done.”</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Taiwo expressed joy that the case had been laid to rest, adding that the better part of his time can now be devoted to thorough representation of the people of his constituency at the green chamber.</p>
      <p>“I give thanks and adoration to God, to God be all the glory and I want to thank the judiciary, this is the first time of having to face the judiciary after an election and I just need to thank them for being the last hope of the common man, I’m so happy and I thank my people.</p>
      <p>“ I am also  extend my hands of fellowship to my opponent that they should let us stop all these acrimony about the election. I lost election in 2015 so many people came to me that I should go to tribunal and that I’m going to get my mandate back.</p>
      <p>“I said ‘no’ nobody have taken me to court before election is won and lost and four years. Later I won election in one court or the other, I started from a normal court as if it is a pre-election matter for a post election matter which is wrong.</p>
      <p>”Today I have passed through the tribunal and I give all thanks and adoration to God but I have stretched my hands of fellowship to them, let’s think more about Ajegunle.</p>
      <p>“This is the time for us to build our own constituency, it is an important time for reflection there are time for everything a time for election, a time to complain, a time to sow and a time to reap ,this supposed to be a time for us to reap and stop sowing I need to concentrate on what I am sent to the National Assembly”, he stated.</p>
      <p>He charged all parties to collaborate for the advancement of a glorious Ajegunle.</p>
