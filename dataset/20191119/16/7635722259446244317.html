      <h1>Joey Carbery "progressing well" but will sit out Munster's clash with Racing 92</h1>

        <b>Munster will again be without fly-half Joey Carbery's for this weekend's visit of Racing 92 to Thomond Park in the Heineken Champions Cup but JJ Hanrahan is back in contention to play. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Carbery is still recovering from the ankle issue he picked up against Italy two months ago and coach Stephen Larkham says that while the former Leinster man is "progressing well", he won't be back for the Racing match:</p>
      <p>“The way I understand it is that we are going to take it slow because there was a fair bit of damage there.</p>
      <p>“He had a really good week last week, which is not to say it’s going happen again this week. Everything is on track for the timeline that we had given him in the first place.</p>
      <p>“He’s not playing this weekend, he’s not ready. We’ll reassess him next week to see how he goes and likewise the following week.”</p>
      <p>But JJ Hanrahan and Rhys Marshall could both be involved against the Parisians with Hanrahan stepping up his recovery from a hamstring injury to train today in Limerick:</p>
      <p>"JJ and Rhys are fully reintegrated back into training today, but it's the back end of their rehab programme, so we need to make sure that they come through today and then come through Thursday before they are considered for selection this weekend."</p>
