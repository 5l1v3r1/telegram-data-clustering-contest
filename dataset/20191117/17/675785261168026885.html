      <p>Charlotte Crosby and Josh Ritchie have broken up, she has confirmed.</p>
      <p>The former Geordie Shore star, 29, announced the news on her Instagram stories on Sunday evening by sharing a single text post.</p>
      <p>She admitted that the two year relationship she'd shared with the Love Island hunk, 25, had "broken down" and she hoped they could "remain civil" after calling it a day.</p>
      <p>Charlotte wrote: "Me and Josh have decided to part ways. Sadly the relationship seems to have broken drown.</p>
      <p>"Hoping we can still remain civil and wish him the best for the future."</p>
      <p>Josh is yet to comment on their breakup on his own Instagram account.</p>

      <p>They got together in February 2018, shortly after she ended her turbulent relationship with Stephen Bear.</p>
      <p>Their relationship was documented from its very early days as he quickly appeared on her programme The Charlotte Show.</p>
      <p>Things got very heated between the loved-up couple during filming, and they even briefly split at one point.</p>
