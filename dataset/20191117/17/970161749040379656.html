        <b>Liverpool have been handed a boost in their pursuit of Genk’s Sander Berge as the Norwegian admits, ‘playing at Anfield is a dream.’</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 21-year-old midfielder has caught the eye thanks to his performances with the Belgian team, who he joined in 2017 from Valerenga.</p>
      <p>He played in both fixtures between Genk and Liverpool in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a> this season and clearly impressed Reds boss <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a>.</p>
      <p>He has also attracted the attention of Napoli, who compete in the same Champions League group, and there could be something of a battle for his signature in January or next summer.</p>
      <p>However, it is Liverpool who seem to have the edge over the Italians, as Berge admits he would love to play at Anfield.</p>
      <p>‘Playing at Anfield is a dream for everyone in the world, and not least for Norwegians,’ Berge tolf TV2.</p>

      <p>‘Liverpool are the best team [at the moment] and have the most fans.</p>
      <p>‘So I could certainly like to play at Anfield as often as possible.’</p>

      <p>Genk technical director Dimitri De Conde has spoken openly about the interest in his player, but says he wants to keep hold of him at least until the summer.</p>
      <p>‘Napoli are interested in Sander and it’s is a possibility,’ De Conde told Radio Punto Nuovo.</p>
      <p>‘We also know Liverpool follow him carefully. Klopp spoke to the boy after the Anfield game, congratulating him on the performance.</p>
      <p>‘In Italy there are clubs that follow Berge and Napoli could be one of these, but to date we have no concrete offers on the table. It could even change in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>‘Berge to Napoli in January? We don’t know. We are currently fighting for our seasonal goals and we are in a complicated situation.</p>
      <p>‘Our intention is to hold on to Sander until the end of the season, but we can’t make any predictions. If the big clubs come knocking at our door, we will have to start negotiations, just as the agent has to do.</p>
      <p>‘These are situations we can’t predict, we’re focused on our season, hoping to keep Sander until May. Then if a top club like Napoli is serious, we will sit at the same table to negotiate, it is logical.’</p>
