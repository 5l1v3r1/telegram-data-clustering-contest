      <p>The Dak Dance has taken over.</p>
      <p>For some unknown reason, a move Dak and other quarterbacks have been doing for years, recently gained national attention after Sunday Night Football put it on display when they showed the Dallas Cowboys QB rocking headphones and doing an unusual hip thrust that was meme’d into oblivion as Twitter added various different music to what Dak was dancing to.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Dak was back at it again with his pregame hip-thrust routine before the game against the Lions, but this time around, he had some company.</p>
      <p>Randy Moss, Tedy Bruschi, and Rex Ryan danced along with Dak as he went through the motions and it was hilarious.</p>
