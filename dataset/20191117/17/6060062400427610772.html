        <li>Federal authorities have accused a New Jersey man of ordering the vandalism of synagogues in Michigan and Wisconsin in September.</li>
        <li>According to a criminal complaint filed last Tuesday and unsealed on Wednesday, 18-year-old Richard Tobin allegedly directed members of a white supremacist organization to deface the synagogues with swastikas and other anti-Semitic symbols.</li>
        <li>Tobin's arrest comes as the US grapples with a "record-high" number of anti-Semitic incidents, <a href="https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/latest-adl-data-at-least-12-white-supremacists-arrested-for-plots-attacks">the Anti-Defamation League said in October</a>.</li>

      <p>Federal authorities allege that a New Jersey man ordered the vandalism of synagogues in <a href="https://www.mininggazette.com/news/2019/09/parade-day-marred-by-act-of-vandalism/">Michigan</a> and <a href="https://journaltimes.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/graffiti-found-on-racine-synagogue-several-anti-semitic-vandalism-incidents/article_45092379-e7e4-5d6f-a62e-7dd91eb13836.html">Wisconsin</a> in September, according to a criminal complaint filed last Tuesday and unsealed on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Richard Tobin, an 18-year-old from Brooklawn, New Jersey, allegedly directed members of a white supremacist organization, referred to as "Group 1" in court filings, to attack the two synagogues with swastikas and other anti-Semitic symbols. "To the best of my knowledge, nothing like this has ever happened before," Rabbi Martyn Adelberg, of Beth Israeli Sinai Congregation in Racine Wisconsin, <a href="https://journaltimes.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/graffiti-found-on-racine-synagogue-several-anti-semitic-vandalism-incidents/article_45092379-e7e4-5d6f-a62e-7dd91eb13836.html">told The Journal Times</a> following the attack.</p>
      <p>Tobin told an FBI agent in October that he directed members of Group 1 to vandalize properties throughout the country, launching "Operation Kristallnacht" (in reference to the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/holocaust/kristallnacht">1938 pogrom in Nazi Germany</a>, in which Nazis torched synagogues, vandalized properties, and killed around 100 Jews) with other members to "tag the sh-t" out of synagogues. The September attacks were carried out by the "Great Lakes cell" of Group 1, he said.</p>
      <p>He communicated with members through online platforms and encrypted online messaging applications from his New Jersey home to discuss, among other things, the recruitment of prospective members, the creation of a white-ethno state, acts of violence against minorities, the group's military training camps, and ways to make improvised explosive devices, according to the complaint. A search of Tobin's computer revealed an obsession with neo-Nazi propaganda, terrorism, and acts of mass violence.</p>
      <p>The group's insignia is associated with a neo-Nazi social media network called The Base, which was created by a self-proclaimed white nationalist intent on uniting neo-Nazis and encouraging them to carry out violence against minority groups, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3mexp/neo-nazis-are-organizing-secretive-paramilitary-training-across-america">according to VICE</a>. The symbol was adopted by the Nazis after 1923 to memorialize members who died in Hitler's failed <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/germany/beer-hall-putsch">Beer Hall Putsch</a>, according to the complaint.</p>
      <p>During his interview with the FBI, Tobin described his desire to incite violent attacks. He said that he had considered committing "suicide-by-cop" on numerous occasions and believed that carrying out a suicide bombing would be "pretty badass." He also said he felt "enraged" by black shoppers at a mall in Edison, New Jersey, while sitting in the parking lot with a machete, and wanted to "let loose."</p>
      <p>"Tobin said that he was triggered by the state of the country, such as when he saw a 'pride parade' or a large number of African Americans in one location. For example, simply being in Times Square in New York caused Tobin to have these feelings," wrote FBI Special Agent Jason Novick.</p>
      <p>Tobin's arrest comes as the US grapples with a "record-high" number of anti-Semitic incidents, <a href="https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/latest-adl-data-at-least-12-white-supremacists-arrested-for-plots-attacks">the Anti-Defamation league said last month</a>. There were 780 anti-Semitic incidents reported in the first six months of 2019, the anti-hate organization found.</p>
      <p>In an effort to combat a potential rise of white nationalist and neo-Nazi violence heading into 2020, federal law enforcement officials have launched hundreds of investigations across the country to stymie domestic terrorism, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/us/politics/domestic-terrorism-justice-department.html">The New York Times reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Tobin currently remains in custody in New Jersey, pending a mental health evaluation, according to court filings.</p>
