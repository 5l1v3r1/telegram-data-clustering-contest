      <h1>£18m Liverpool target drops transfer hint after Anfield comments</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:33:43+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:33</time> by <a rel="author">Jaikuran Randhawa</a></address>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/sander-berge-drops-liverpool-transfer-20899925?2">Mirror Football</a>, Genk sensation Sander Berge hinted to Norwegian outlet TV2 that he’d like to move to Liverpool in the future.</p>
      <p>Norway international Sander Berge has hinted that he’d like to move to Liverpool in the future by admitting that he wants to play at Anfield “as often as possible.”</p>
      <p>Berge impressed against the Reds when Genk met Jurgen Klopp’s side on two occasions in the Champions League recently.</p>
      <p>The Mirror add that the ace is valued at around £18m and that Italian giants Napoli are also keen on his signature.</p>

        <b>Here’s what the Norwegian had to say on a possible move to the Reds:</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Playing at Anfield is a dream for everyone in the world, and not least for Norwegians,” Berge said to TV2.</p>
      <p>“Liverpool are the best team [at the moment] and have the most fans.”</p>
      <p>“So I could certainly like to play at Anfield as often as possible.”</p>
      <p>Berge certainly looks like potential superstar for the future, the 21-year-old already has 19 senior caps for Norway.</p>
      <p>Considering that defensive midfield is an area where experience is often seen as crucial, this is an amazing achievement for the youngster.</p>
      <p>Liverpool stars James Milner and Jordan Henderson are getting towards the final years of their careers, so a move for Berge could make sense.</p>
      <p>The ace would be a solid backup to Fabinho, his signature could even allow the Brazilian superstar to play further forward.</p>
