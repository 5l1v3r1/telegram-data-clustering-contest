      <h1>Penn State QB Sean Clifford Has A Message For Ohio State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:16:17+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Penn State recovered from last week’s road loss to Minnesota with a solid home win over Indiana. That win sets up a high-stakes showdown with Ohio State next week with a spot in the Big Ten Championship Game potentially on the line.</p>
      <p>Sean Clifford is ready for Ohio State. Following the 34-27 win over the Hoosiers, the Nittany Lions signal caller had a message for the Buckeyes.</p>
      <p>Speaking to a reporter after the win, Clifford called his team “very, very hungry” to beat Ohio State next week.</p>
      <blockquote>“We are not done, because we have one loss, and we are very, very hungry.”</blockquote>

      <p>Despite their loss to Minnesota and Ohio State’s undefeated record, the Nittany Lions still control their own destiny in the Big Ten title race.</p>
      <p>If they can upset Ohio State at The Shoe next week and finish the season with a win over Rutgers, they’ll be in the Big Ten Championship Game.</p>
      <p>Then, they’ll either face Wisconsin or a rematch with Minnesota.</p>
      <p>But the Nittany Lions will need to tighten things up on defense to have a chance. After not allowing 14 points in the first six games, they’ve allowed at least 21 points in three of their last four.</p>
      <p>One thing is for sure: Next week’s Penn State-Ohio State game is a must-watch.</p>
