      <p>Victims will no longer have to present evidence for a second time when court cases resurface on appeal after the passing of new legislation.</p>
      <p>The Justice Legislation Amendment (Criminal Appeals) Bill abolishes 'de novo' appeals from the Magistrates Court, which means witnesses - including victims - won't have to give another statement during an appeal.</p>
      <p>The passing of the legislation is too little, too late for Hope (not her real name as she has requested to remain anonymous), a Ballarat woman who alleged she was sexually abused at the age of 13.</p>
      <p>After a guilty verdict was handed down in the Magistrates Court, the decision was appealed two days later, forcing Hope to re-submit all her evidence, this time without the use of a witness protection screen.</p>
      <p>Hope told <i>The Courier </i>about how it felt to have to take the stand again, this time without the screen.</p>
      <blockquote>The stress and anxiety I felt at trying to answer questions as I was cross-examined was too much.<cite>Hope</cite></blockquote>
      <p>"I was not only put in the position of recalling the alleged abuse in minute detail, but I had to look at the alleged perpetrator during the process."</p>
      <p>The guilty verdict was ultimately overturned. The impact the court case had on her mental health was significant.</p>
      <p>Between the guilty verdict and the result of the appeal, which was covered extensively in the media, Hope tried to end her life three times.</p>
      <p>Suffering from complex post traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD), Hope added "the anxiety, stress and mental anguish of the court process is incredibly challenging to a victim, to have to go through such a process twice is incredibly unfair."</p>
      <p>Hope believes now that 'de novo' appeals are a thing of the past, witnesses and abuse victims will come away as the big winners.</p>
      <blockquote>I believe the 'de novo' appeal being abolished with save a lot of re trauma for a victim.<cite>Hope</cite></blockquote>
      <p>She added has this legislation been in place at the time of her case, the appeals may not have been successful.</p>
      <p>"Had the De Novo appeal been abolished then and the testimony been used from the Magistrates Court, where a witness protection screen had been granted, I believes the second verdict quite possibly could have been a very different outcome."</p>
      <p>State Leader of Derryn Hinch's Justice Party, Stuart Grimley, said the new legislation will make a significant impact within Western Victorian courts.</p>

      <p>Parts of Western Victoria are unfortunately renowned for historic abuse, particularly sexual abuse," he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"If this Bill helps only one person not have to relive their traumatic story again and again in the courts, then it is worth supporting.</p>
      <p>"There is very little reason why victims should ever need to take the stand, be cross-examined and tell of their abuse to a court more than once."</p>
