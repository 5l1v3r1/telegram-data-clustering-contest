      <p><b>MEXICO CITYÂ (AP)</b> - Tropical Storm Raymond has fizzled into a remnant low-pressure system over the Pacific off western Mexico and is forecast to likely avoid a direct hit on the resorts of Los Cabos.</p>
      <p>The U.S. National Hurricane Center says the storm could still dump 3 to 5 inches of rain on southern parts of the Baja California Peninsula, however, threatening dangerous flash floods.</p>
      <p>Baja California Sur state's civil defense department warned of strong rains Sunday from the storm.</p>
      <p>The hurricane center said in its final bulletin on Raymond that the storm's maximum sustained winds had decreased to about 30 mph (45 kph).</p>
      <p>The storm's center was about 275 miles (440 kilometers) south-southwest of the peninsula's southern tip, and it was heading north at 16 mph (26 kph).</p>
