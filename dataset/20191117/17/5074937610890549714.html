      <h1>Red Cross sensitises stakeholders on International Humanitarian Law</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:58:29+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:58</time> by <a rel="author">Isaac Arkoh/Nana Oye Gyimah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Cape Coast, Nov. 17, GNA - The Ghana Red Cross Society (GRCS) hasÂ  organised a sensitisation workshop on International Humanitarian Law (IHL) for allied institutions in Cape Coast engaged in offering security and humanitarian services.</p>
      <p>The IHL is a set of rules, which seek humanitarian reasons to limit the effects of armed conflict, protect persons who are not or are no longer participating in the hostilities and restricts the means and methods of warfare.</p>
      <p>It was attended by personnel from the Ghana National Fire Service (GNFS), Ghana Immigration Service (GIS), Prison service, Ghana Ambulance Service and the media.</p>
      <p>Highlighting the demands of the law, Mr Louis Ampong Okyere, the National Communications Manager of GRCS, encouraged participants to thoroughly see to its implementation to protect the rights of all citizens.</p>
      <p>Mr Samuel Kofi Addo, the Secretary General, said the Red Cross, the largest volunteer based humanitarian service organisation in the country, was operating in 216 districts and 10 regions.</p>
      <p>Members are dedicated to supporting the vulnerable and the needy in communities and train volunteers in first aid, disaster management, and disaster risk reduction with reliable support services in times of emergencies and rescue missions.</p>
      <p>The GRCS is also providing shelter, water, school infrastructure and effectively building the capacity of traditional birth attendants on safe motherhood with well-equipped tricycle services for hard to reach communities.</p>
      <p>Mr John Ekow Aidoo, the Regional Manager of the GCRS, stressed the need for the public to respect the emblem of the RED CROSS and give it the needed recognition as its abuse or misuse could have legal implications.</p>
      <p>"The Red Cross has become a generic sign of medical aid and it is a universal logo for health and help. It serves as a protective use and an identification for staffers and also as an indicative sign."</p>
