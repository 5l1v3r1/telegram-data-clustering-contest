      <p>Congress leader and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah claimed here on Sunday that the party was out to sweep the byelections slated to be held in the State on December 5.</p>
      <p>Speaking to mediapersons, Mr. Siddaramaiah expressed confidence that the Congress would win 12 out of 15 seats and it was determined to inflict a crushing defeat on the disqualified MLAs.</p>
      <p>“I was the one who ensured their disqualification and I will ensure their defeat,” he said.</p>
      <h3>‘Gimmick’</h3>
      <p>Referring to A.H. Vishwanath — disqualified MLA who is now contesting from Hunsur on BJP ticket — and his proposal to hive off Hunsur from Mysuru and create a new district, Mr. Siddaramaiah dismissed it as a gimmick. “He has never raised the issue in the past nor has he undertaken development works in the region. He is talking of a new district for Hunsur in the run-up to the elections,” said Mr. Siddaramaiah.</p>
