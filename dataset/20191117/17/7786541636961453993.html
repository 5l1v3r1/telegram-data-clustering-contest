      <p>Gentlemen, start your engines.</p>
      <p>An AFC showdown featuring Houston's Deshaun Watson and Baltimore's Lamar Jackson highlights the NFL's Week 11 schedule. It's intriguing enough to overshadow a 2018 Super Bowl rematch between New England and Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>Aside from a key matchup of two of the AFC's top three teams, the Watson-Jackson matchup of former first-round draft picks is the league's first between quarterbacks with at least 15 touchdowns passing, five rushing and a quarterback rating of 100 or higher through their first nine games.</p>
      <p>Watson is two touchdowns passing from becoming the fifth player to have 20 and at least five TDs rushing through the first 10 games of a season. Carolina's Cam Newton was the previous to do so in 2015.</p>
      <p>Jackson last week joined Ben Roethlisberger, who did it in 2007, to become the only players to post two games with a perfect quarterback rating of 158.3 in the same season.</p>
      <p>The AFC North-leading Ravens are 7-2 and have won five straight. The South-leading Texans are 6-3 and have won four of five.</p>
      <p>The AFC East-leading Patriots are coming off their bye week to face the Eagles, less than two years after Philadelphia won its first Super Bowl title by beating New England 41-33 in Minnesota.</p>
