      <p>A conservative radio show host says he was fired mid-show after criticizing President Trump.</p>
      <p>Craig Silverman <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/11/16/craig-silverman-radio-show-donald-trump/">told The Denver Post</a> that he was discussing the president’s notorious former New York lawyer, Roy Cohn, when his weekly 710 KNUS radio station suddenly cut to a news bulletin.</p>
      <p>As he looked to his crew to see what was wrong, he says program director Kelly Michaels suddenly walked into the room.</p>
      <p>“You’re done,” Michaels told Silverman, a former chief deputy district attorney in Denver, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Silverman said that the hour before he was axed had seen him discussing “how toxic Trump is in Colorado” as well as suggesting “Democrats are making a strong case at the House impeachment hearing.”</p>
      <p>His firing sparked outrage, with <a href="https://twitter.com/Dylan_RobertsCO/status/1195770413126758401">Rep. Dylan Roberts tweeted</a> that it was a “sad day for Colorado and the First Amendment.”</p>
      <p>“I cannot and will not toe strict Trump party line,” Silverman wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“I call things as I see them. I see corruption and blatant dishonesty by President and his cronies. I also see bullying/smearing of American heroes w/courage to take oath and tell truth. Their bravery inspires me.”</p>
      <p>KNUS did not respond to requests for comment, The Denver Post said.</p>
      <p>The page for Silverman’s show now gives a <a href="https://710knus.com/content/all/craigsilverman">“404 Error — Not Found”</a> message.</p>
