      <p>Shaw has updated its ‘My Shaw’ app with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/cy/app/my-shaw/id1217939030">new features</a> to allow users to refresh their TV channels and restart their modems.</p>
      <p>The new features gives Shaw customers an easier way to troubleshoot their TV and home internet straight from the app.</p>
      <p>Now when users open up the My Shaw app, they have the option to restart their modem under the ‘Troubleshoot’ options. Once you tap the ‘Restart’ button a pop-up will explain the process.</p>
      <p>“We’ve included two new troubleshooting options that allow you to refresh your TV channels and restart your modem with the tap of a button,” the updated <a href="https://apps.apple.com/cy/app/my-shaw/id1217939030">app description reads.</a></p>
      <p>To refresh your TV channels, you’ll have to go into the ‘Manage TV &amp; BlueCurve TV App Device’ settings. Then you have to tap ‘Refresh,’ after which you’ll receive a confirmation notification. The company says that it can take up to 10 minutes for the channels to refresh.</p>
      <p>The new features are available for both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/cy/app/my-shaw/id1217939030">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.shaw.android.selfserve&amp;hl=en_CA">Android</a> users with the My Shaw app.</p>
