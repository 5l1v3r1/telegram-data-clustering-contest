      <p>A man has been arrested after the Wycombe Wanderers goalkeeper, Ryan Allsop, alleged homophobic abuse was aimed at him during Sunday’s League One game at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/tranmere">Tranmere</a>.</p>
      <p>The Merseyside club confirmed an incident did occur during the match at Prenton Park - which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/wycombe">Wycombe</a> won 2-0 to move to the top of the division - and is being dealt with by police. It is understood that Allsop, 27, reported the abuse to the referee during the interval after he had kept goal at the Kop end in the first half.</p>
      <p>A statement from the home club read: “Tranmere Rovers Football Club are very disappointed to learn of a homophobic comment made during today’s match against Wycombe Wanderers. The club takes matters like this very seriously with a zero-tolerance policy. As a consequence of today’s actions, one supporter has been arrested and the matter is being dealt with by the police.”</p>
      <p>The Football Association is also understood to be aware of the incident and will await the referee’s report and seek further information from all parties involved before deciding how to proceed. Speaking about the alleged incident, Gareth Ainsworth, Wycombe’s manager, said: “If that’s the case, then for me there are some stupid idiots about. Whether it’s racist or homophobic, whatever it is, we have to stamp this out. I have to credit Ryan Allsop for being brave enough to stand up and say I’m reporting this, and that’s what we are and I’ll stand by him.”</p>
      <p>Adebayo Akinfenwa scored Wycombe’s first goal with a header in the 43rd minute before a penalty from Joe Jacobson on the stroke of half-time secured the win for Ainsworth’s side.</p>
      <p>On the allegation of homophobic abuse, Tranmere’s manager, Micky Mellon, added: “What I do know is Tranmere is a club of great values. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. If people are proven to have done the wrong thing, then they will be suitably punished as much as they can be.”</p>
