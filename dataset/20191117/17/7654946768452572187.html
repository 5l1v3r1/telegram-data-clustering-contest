      <h1>Rob Gronkowski teases ‘big announcement’ ahead of Patriots deadline</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:02:54+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:02</time> by <a rel="author">Jaclyn Hendricks</a></address>
      <p>Rob Gronkowski teased Saturday that he will be dropping a major announcement this week, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/10/rob-gronkowskis-deadline-for-patriots-return-is-looming/">as his decision day</a> with the Patriots looms.</p>
      <p>Taking to social media, Gronkowski said he “can’t wait” to share the news with Gronk nation on Tuesday, stating, “It’s going to be fun. It’s going to be wild. It’s going to be a good time.”</p>
      <p>The timing is quite peculiar given the tight end remains on the IR/retired list and has until the end of November to reach a decision about his NFL future. Should he remain on the list after Nov. 30, he’ll be ineligible to play this year, in accordance with league rules.</p>
      <p>Last week, <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001074684/article/kraft-told-gronk-that-pats-want-him-back-for-playoffs">NFL Network reported</a> that team owner Robert Kraft extended an invitation to Gronkowski to rejoin the team ahead of the playoffs.</p>
      <p>Since announcing his retirement in March, Gronkowski has kept busy. In August, the Super Bowl champ announced his partnership with CBD Medic. Last month, he joined Fox as an NFL analyst.</p>
