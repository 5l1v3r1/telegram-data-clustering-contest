      <h1>Eden Hazard reckons Frank Lampard could become best manager in the world</h1>
      <h2>The pair played together at Chelsea but Hazard moved on to Real Madrid before Lampard made his return to Stamford Bridge as manager in the summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:12:49+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:12</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/eden-hazard">Eden Hazard</a> has tipped <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/frank-lampard">Frank Lampard</a> to be the best manager in the world after his flying start at Chelsea.</p>
      <p>The Blues boss took up the helm at Stamford Bridge in the summer having had just one season in management with Championship side Derby.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> are currently on a good run of form, having lost just one of their last 11 fixtures in all competitions, with Lampard placing an increased focus on developing the youth players at the club.</p>
      <p>And Hazard feels their remarkable start is all down to his former teammate, who he believes has the credentials for greater success in the hot seat.</p>
      <p>"I wasn't surprised about Frank Lampard," Hazard said after Belgium's win over Russia on Saturday. "I know Frank as a player not a manager but he is a great guy.</p>

      <p>"He has shown already in four months that he came be one of the best managers in the world.</p>
      <p>"The good thing is they are playing with young English players. They are lucky to have young players with quality.</p>
      <p>"Maybe with two or three more they would be first in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"When I saw them play it was nice to see them all play together. I still have friends there are want them to do well."</p>

      <p>Chelsea's start has been all the more impressive when you consider they lost their best player in Hazard in the summer, and are still under an enforced transfer ban set down by FIFA.</p>
      <p>That has given the likes of youngsters Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori the chance to stake their claims for regular first-team berths.</p>
      <p>And Lampard's faith has been rewarded, with all three players earning cal-ups to the senior England squad while Abraham tops the club's scoring charts.</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool defender Jason McAteer was effusive in his praise for Lampard, telling the <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/sport/saturday-columns/jason-mcateer-ireland-need-a-special-performance-to-see-off-clever-denmark/409323">Racing Post</a> : "What Brendan Rodgers is doing at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> is outstanding and the job Frank Lampard is doing at Chelsea is probably even more impressive.</p>
      <p>"I remember speaking to Frank when Chelsea and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> played the Super Cup in Istanbul and you could hear his concerns.</p>
      <p>"Where were the goals going to come from? Could Mason Mount do for Chelsea what he had done for Derby? Would he miss Antonio Rudiger?</p>
      <p>"But he and his players have answered all those questions and more."</p>
