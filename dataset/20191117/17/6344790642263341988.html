      <p><b>Greg Nicotero</b>’s horror anthology series <b><i>Creepshow</i></b> was a lot of fun to watch and it was loaded with a ton of Easter Eggs, some of which you might have missed while watching the show. There are a lot of <b>Stephen King</b> Easter eggs along with <i>Day of the Dead, Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Evil Dead, The Shining, Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>, and more.</p>
      <p>Thanks to a video that was released by AMC’s streaming service Shudder, you can see every Easter egg that was packed into this show.</p>
      <p>If you haven’t watched the first season of <i>Creepshow</i> yet, you should check it out! The series was so well received that Shudder has renewed it for a second season.</p>
