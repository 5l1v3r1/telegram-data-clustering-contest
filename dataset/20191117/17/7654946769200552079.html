      <p>Now impeachment really is a soap opera.</p>
      <p>Jon Hamm helped Saturday Night Live turn the impeachment hearings into a racy TV soap — even getting to kiss a pretend Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who was brought in to inject some glamor.</p>
      <p>The show’s cold-opener joked that the skit was needed because the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/over-13m-watched-first-impeachment-hearings-fox-news-no-1/">13 million who tuned in for the hearings</a> complained they were “lacking in pizzazz,” “dull” and “not The Masked Singer.”</p>
      <p>“So to make sure people are paying attention, we now present the hearings in a way that underscores how scandalous these revelations really are,” a voiceover said.</p>
      <p>“‘Days of our Impeachment’ — where the only thing at stake is our democracy,” the voiceover continued, calling its “Days of our Lives” spin-off “the first soap where you can’t imagine any of the people in it having sex.”</p>
      <p>With SNL castmembers playing key impeachment players such as Adam Schiff, Jim Jordan and diplomat Marie Yovanovitch, the biggest cheer came for “Mad Men” star Hamm as he was introduced as ambassador Bill Taylor.</p>
      <p>His attention was soon won over by the arrival of Melissa Villaseñor clad in black as “telenovela sensation, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.”</p>
      <p>“This hearing is lacking one thing – a star,” the show’s AOC insisted as she shook out her hair seductively.</p>
      <p>As Hamm’s Taylor immediately approached her, with romantic music playing and her hair blowing in the wind, the mock AOC told him, “I didn’t expect you to be such a low key daddy.”</p>
      <p>“Now here’s a red new deal, it’s my lips,” she said, kissing him passionately in true soap opera star after the joke about her Green New Deal.</p>
      <p>Other unexpected moments included show favorite Pete Davidson in a bald skull cap to play Stormy Daniel’s former lawyer Michael Avenatti — calling him Michael Avocado — failing to get any interest in his “news” that the president had an affair with a porn star.</p>
      <p>Kenan Thompson also appeared as Cleveland Browns star defensive end Myles Garrett coming up with a wild excuse for his <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-suspended-indefinitely-for-browns-steelers-fight/">helmet attack</a> on Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph.</p>
      <p>“I saw another player who had lost his helmet somehow and I thought, ‘Oh, he should be wearing a helmet.’ So I attempted to put it back on his head,” he said.</p>
      <p>Told he was not on trial, Thompson’s Garrett said, “Oh I know — President Trump just pardoned me too for the war crimes. He said I could bring a helmet to Afghanistan and just go nuts.”</p>
      <p>The skit ended with him using his helmet to hit a bumbling Rudy Giuliani, played Kate McKinnon, who stood up after and said, “He might have fixed me.”</p>
