      <p>All migrants will pay a £625 surcharge for NHS care, regardless of whether or not they use the health service, under <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a>’s post-Brexit immigration policy.</p>
      <p>EU migrants who move to the UK will no longer receive preferential treatment, the prime minister claimed in a statement today.</p>
      <p>He told The Sunday Times: ‘If people return a majority Conservative government we will ensure that people who come to our great country from anywhere in the world will contribute on day one to our NHS.</p>
      <p>‘The British people pay huge amounts to get great NHS care, it is only fair that everyone in the UK does.’</p>
      <p>EU migrants are currently exempt from charges, while those outside the EU pay £400.</p>
      <p>Tory immigration policies also include a five-year wait to obtain welfare payments, as Mr Johnson pledges to bring the number of migrants down ‘overall’.</p>

      <p>All migrants would be treated the same from January 2021 under the new Conservative plans.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said: ‘As we come out of the EU we have a new opportunity for fairness and to make sure all those who come here are treated the same.</p>

      <p>When asked whether Labour would continue freedom of movement after Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn told BBC TV there would be ‘a great deal of movement’.</p>
      <p>However, the full details of both parties’ polices will be released in election manifestos expected to be published this week.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson are due to go head-to-head in their first televised debate on Tuesday evening, as opinion polls show the Tories to have the highest level of support since 2017.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives lead Labour by 10-17 percentage points, four polls late on Saturday showed.</p>
      <p>Corbyn has stated he will not form a coalition government if his party fails to secure a majority in parliament.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘We are not forming coalition governments, we will put forward the programme on which we will have been elected.</p>

      <p>‘The SNP will have a choice, do they want to put Boris Johnson back in … or are they going to say a Labour government will deliver for Scotland.’</p>
      <p>When questioned on demands for a Scottish independence referendum in return for the support of the Scottish National Party, he added: ‘We are not doing deals with anybody.’</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson hopes to win a majority to push through his Brexit deal, but Mr Corbyn has promised to renegotiate the exit agreement and then hold another referendum.</p>
      <p>The Conservative leader plans a Brexit debate in parliament on December 23 if he wins, The Mail on Sunday reports.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson has claimed all Conservative election candidates have pledged to vote for his Brexit deal in parliament.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, he said: ‘If we get a majority Conservative government we can deliver and there will be no more wrangling or dither or delay.’</p>
      <p>The prime minister failed to get his deal approved by parliament ahead of the October 31 deadline after MPs opposed fast-tracking of the agreement.</p>
