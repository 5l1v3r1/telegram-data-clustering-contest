      <h1>Paul Finebaum’s Message For Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:54:51+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffered a dislocated hip in yesterday’s win over Mississippi State, ending his season and presumably his college career.</p>
      <p>The devastating injury broke the hearts of Crimson Tide fans and immediately brought concern for Tagovailoa’s football future. Hopefully, he will still be able to achieve his NFL goals.</p>
      <p>This morning, ESPN radio host and SEC media personality Paul Finebaum shared a message of support for Tagovailoa on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“As dawn has broken across the nation this Sunday morning, a desperate feeling of devastation for @Tuaamann has turned to one of hope for his health and recovery. #PrayersforTua,” Finebaum tweeted.</p>

      <p>There is plenty to debate regarding Nick Saban’s decision to still have Tagovailoa in the game–or to play him at all–when he got hurt.</p>
      <p>However, no one should lose sight over what is really important here, and that’s the future for Tua on and off the field.</p>
      <p>We wish him the best and hope he can make a full recovery and resume playing.</p>
