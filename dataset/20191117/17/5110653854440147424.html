      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:47:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:47</time> by <a rel="author">James Crabtree-Hannigan</a></address>
      <p>The most noteworthy event of the week likely happened during the Thursday night game, but there's still the rest of the Week 11 NFL schedule to play Sunday and Monday.</p>
      <p>Among those games are the Patriots facing the Eagles, and the Ravens hosting the Texans, though the odds of those matchups replicating the fireworks of the brawl between Cleveland and Pittsburgh are low.</p>
      <p>The 49ers will look to recover from their first loss of the season at home against the Cardinals, who nearly beat San Francisco two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>In the AFC South, the Colts take on the Jaguars as both teams try to keep pace with Houston.</p>
