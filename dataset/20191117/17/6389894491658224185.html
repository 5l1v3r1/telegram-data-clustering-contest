      <p>Berkeley Homes chairman Tony Pidgley has backed an overhaul of property laws to end land hoarding in a bid to boost home ownership. </p>
      <p>Pidgley, the founder of the FTSE 100 housebuilding giant, said land owners and developers should work with local authorities on “planning uplift” to tackle the shortage of affordable homes. </p>

      <p>Pidgley said the system is in “dire need of reform” in order for more homes to be built to solve the housing crisis.  </p>
      <p>“We need a central body that buys land, awards planning permission, then passes on the returns to the local community,” he said, the Sunday Telegraph reported. </p>
      <p>“The whole of society should capture that value – it’s about decency.”</p>
      <p>So-called land banking is the practice of buying up plots and securing planning permission to increase value without delivering on any new homes.</p>

      <p>Developers have come under increasing pressure over the practice, and council leaders have called for the state to secure a larger share of land value increase after planning permission is given. </p>
      <p>“We’re in the building business and that’s where we should compete, not in trading land – as long as there is room to make a decent margin on housebuilding,” Pidgley said in a new book, titled Home Truths. </p>
