        <b>THE Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Sunday says it has accounted for all the 30 ad-hoc staff engaged for the 2019 governorship election in Kogi State.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/363668-kogidecides-inec-declares-30-staff-missing.html">The electoral Commission</a></b> had earlier been reported to have declared 30 of its staff missing.</p>
      <p>They were declared missing around 1 a.m. on Sunday during the final collation of results in the local government.</p>
      <p>The missing INEC staff include Presiding Officers (POs) and Assistant Presiding Officers (APOs) of polling units in Imane ward 1 and 2 of Olamaboro LGA of Kogi State.</p>
      <p>Many of the ad-hoc staff used by INEC were youth corps members of the NYSC.</p>
      <p>However, Rotimi Oyekanmi, Chief Press Secretary to the INEC Chairman stated in a statement that the Commission has established that none of them was either injured or killed.</p>
      <p>“These election-day staff could not be accounted for initially following the violent attacks by some armed thugs at their respective duty posts after the close of polls,” Oyekanmi said in the statement.</p>
      <p>According to him, the ad-hoc staff were able to conclude the collation process before the attacks.</p>
      <p>“They are safe, sound and back in their respective homes,” he added.</p>
      <p>“The Chairman of the Commission has personally spoken with some of them and they confirmed that they are hale and hearty.”</p>
