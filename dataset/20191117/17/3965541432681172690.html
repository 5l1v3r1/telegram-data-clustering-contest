      <p>Saugus High School will remain closed until Dec. 2 but counselors will be available to help students cope with their grief, said school district officials in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita.</p>
      <p>Detectives were <a href="https://wcti12.com/news/nation-world/officials-id-victim-killed-at-california-school">searching for a motive</a> for the killings carried out by Nathaniel Tennosuke Berhow on Thursday, his 16th birthday. The teen pulled a .45-caliber handgun from his backpack and shot five students at random before shooting himself in the head. He died the next day.</p>

      <p>Berhow had shown <a href="https://wcti12.com/news/nation-world/california-school-shooting-suspect-described-as-quiet-smart">no signs of violence </a>and didn’t appear to be linked to any ideology, authorities said.</p>
      <p>After more than 40 interviews and a search of his home, authorities still were in the dark, Capt. Kent Wegener of the Sheriff’s Department’s homicide unit said at a press conference Friday.</p>
      <blockquote>"We did not find any manifesto, any diary that spelled it out, any suicide note or any writings," he said.</blockquote>
      <p>Meanwhile authorities were investigating online threats against schools in and around the Santa Clarita, sheriff’s officials said Sunday. Investigators have not found any of the threats made on social media to be credible, officials said. Additional law enforcement will be posted at area schools Monday.</p>
