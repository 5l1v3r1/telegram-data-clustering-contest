      <p><b>SAN DIEGO — </b>Family members say a 9-year-old San Diego boy who survived an apparent murder-suicide that left his parents and three brothers dead is on life support.</p>
      <p>Police say the child’s father is suspected of shooting his sons and their mother before turning the gun on himself Saturday.</p>
      <p>Investigators say the parents were estranged and the mother had obtained a restraining order against the father.</p>
      <p>The Union-Tribune reports Sunday that family members set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for medical expenses. The posting says the boy remains in intensive care.</p>
      <p>Officers found a 29-year-old woman, her 31-year-old husband and their 3-year-old son dead. Two boys, ages 5 and 11, died at hospitals.</p>
      <p>The newspaper says police had gone to the house two weeks ago to “keep the peace” when the man came over to retrieve tools.</p>
