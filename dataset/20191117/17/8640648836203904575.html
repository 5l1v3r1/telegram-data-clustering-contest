      <p>Golden Knights left wing Brandon Pirri cleared waivers Sunday and was assigned to the American Hockey League’s Chicago Wolves.</p>
      <p>Pirri, 28, was <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/goldenknights/golden-knights-place-left-wing-brandon-pirri-on-waivers-1894339/">placed on waivers</a> Saturday by the Knights after he recorded no goals and one assist in 11 games. That gave the other 30 NHL teams a chance to claim him and his two-year contract worth $775,000 annually, but none did.</p>
      <p>In addition, the Knights also sent center rookie center Nicolas Roy to the Wolves. Roy was a healthy scratch Saturday against the Los Angeles Kings.</p>
