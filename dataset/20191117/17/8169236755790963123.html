        <b>Manchester United fans have called for their club to go back in for Sporting Lisbon midfielder Bruno Fernandes after he scored a fine goal for Portugal during their 2-0 win over Luxembourg on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fernandes scores the opener in his side’s two-goal victory against Luxembourg this weekend, as Cristiano Ronaldo and Co secured their place at Euro 2020 with a win.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old’s strike was something special, as he <a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/11/17/video-bruno-fernandes-goal-portugal-vs-luxembourg/">took a long ball over the top down brilliantly before firing home with his second touch from just outside the area.</a></p>
      <p>Following this fine strike, Red Devils supporters everywhere took to Twitter to call for the club to go back in for Fernandes in the upcoming transfer windows and secure a deal to bring him to Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Fernandes, who’s valued at around €55M (£47M) as per <a href="https://www.donbalon.com/futbol/laliga/quiere-sustituir-modric-llama-florentino-perez-ofrece-madrid">Don Balon</a>, was linked with a move to United over the summer, however a move for the player ultimately failed to materialise.</p>
      <p>And now, it seems United fans are gagging to see their club go back in for the player in the near future and snag a deal to bring him to the Premier League before it’s too late…</p>
