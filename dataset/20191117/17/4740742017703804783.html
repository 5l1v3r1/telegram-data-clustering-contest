      <h1>Bristol City, Middlesbrough, Cardiff City and Derby County linked with Scottish Premiership striker - reports</h1>
      <h2>Lee Johnson is in the hunt for addition options up front</h2>

      <p>Bristol City are one of six Championship clubs reported to be looking at adding Livingston forward Lyndon Dykes.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/exclusive-derby-one-of-six-championship-clubs-keen-on-livingston-star">Team Talk</a> , the Scottish club could well be open to selling the 6ft 2in forward, who despite signing last January on a two-year deal from Queen of the South only made his debut for the club this season after immediately going back to his former club on loan for the second half of the season.</p>
      <p>Cardiff City, Swansea City, Middlesbrough, Derby County and Blackburn Rovers are also credited with having an interest in the 24-year-old.</p>
      <p>Dykes has been in impressive form during the 2019/20 campaign, netting five goals - including one in a shock victory against Scottish Premiership leaders Celtic, and notching up two assists in 14 games.</p>

      <p>Now the Australian-born forward's form is believed to have caught the eye of admirers elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Socceroos manager Graham Arnold revealed he is considering call-up the attacking, telling <i>SunSport</i>: “We are monitoring Lyndon — Australia is keen on all good players.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Scotland manager Steve Clarke is also monitoring his form with Lions boss Gary Holt urging the SFA to get in first.</p>
      <p>The report claims Livingston could decide to cash in when the transfer window re-opens in January with plenty of clubs looking to improve their attacking options; none more so than Bristol City who lost in-form striker Benik Afobe to a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury early in the season.</p>
      <p>There is no mention of how much it would take to prise the striker away from the Scottish Premiership outfit.</p>
