      <h1>Everton victorious over Liverpool but fans exceed all expectations on landmark day for women's football</h1>
      <h2>A huge crowd turns out to watch the Merseyside derby as Everton win 1-0 thanks to Lucy Graham's goal at Anfield</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:02:22+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/sam-carroll/" target="_blank">Sam Carroll</a></address>
      <p>A crowd of 23,500 watched Everton record a 1-0 victory in Sunday's Merseyside Derby at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Liverpool goalkeeper Anke Preuss fumbled a tame, 30-yard effort from visiting captain Lucy Graham on the stroke of half-time that spilled into the back of the net in front of the Kop and handed the Blues all three points. </p>
      <p>Home supporters stood with scarves outstretched to welcome their side onto the field while Everton fans – who valiantly filled most of the away end – played their own vociferous part.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> were the early aggressors and only a stunning save from Tinja Korpela – the goalkeeper clawing the ball off the line with her left-hand – kept the scores level.</p>
      <p>Niamh Charles offered a constant threat for the Reds with her pace on the break while Korpela was once more called upon from a bouncing Rhiannon Roberts strike.</p>

      <p>Everton midfielder Graham, however, had not read the script and her strike – the first on target for the visitors – caught Preuss off guard and handed Willie Kirk's side the lead.</p>
      <p>Liverpool, try as they might in the second-half, could not find a response. </p>
      <p>Overall, though, this afternoon was not strictly about the result.</p>
      <p>Both Vicky Jepson and Kirk would argue otherwise, of course, but Everton and Liverpool played out an enthralling spectacle with late home pressure ramping up the volume at Anfield. </p>
      <p>The surrounding area before the game was filled with supporters new and old but there was a palpable presence of young female supporters who could be heard shouting excitedly when Liverpool launched an attack.</p>

      <p>While Virgil van Dijk, Lucas Digne, Mohamed Salah and Richarlison remain idols for followers the world over, this was the first real, publicised opportunity for women's football on Merseyside in a long time. </p>
      <p>The offering did not disappoint – and the men could well find themselves rivalled by the likes of Charles, Mel Lawley and Rinsola Babajide by some sections of the fanbase.</p>
      <p>Preuss' error aside – the Liverpool stopper was otherwise excellent – every woman played her part in a true advert for ladies football.</p>
      <p>Whether it be a new supporter or aspiring future talent, overcoming the initial target of a 20,000 attendance proves there is a real appetite locally for the game.</p>
      <p>As Liverpool pushed for an equaliser, the volume crackled with the Kop desperate to see a goal against their bitter rivals.</p>
      <p>It did not materialise, and Everton will be delighted with a hard-earned three points to continue their impressive start to the Women's Super League.</p>
      <p>But as You'll Never Walk Alone rang out for a second-time pre-match, you would now like to think it will not be long before you hear it again, at Anfield, for a women's clash.</p>
      <p>And with the reverse fixture set for February, after such a terrific turnout and atmosphere, perhaps the Goodison Park siren will continue the push to advertise women's football across Merseyside and inspire our local stars of the future.</p>
