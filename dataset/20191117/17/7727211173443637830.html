      <p>The Netflix show offers a twist on a popular classic by instead focusing on a crime solving gang of children.</p>
      <p>The new series follows a group of street urchins, known as the Baker Street Irregulars, whose crime solving skills are used by Holmes and passed off as his own.</p>

      <p>The Baker Street Irregulars are a fictional group of boys that did in fact appear in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novels and provided the famous detective with intelligence.</p>
      <p>The new drama is written by Oscar-nominated writer Tom Bidwell who has described the show as his "dream project".</p>

      <p>Speaking about the upcoming series to BBC Writersroom, Bidwell said: "Sherlock Holmes in Conan Doyle's books had a group of street kids he'd use to help him gather clues, so our series is what if Sherlock was a drug addict and a delinquent and the kids solved the whole case while he takes credit.</p>
      <p>"It's my dream project and my oldest idea and I've been pitching it for ten years."</p>
      <p>The show is expected to be filming until May 2020 across several different locations.</p>
      <p>Liverpool has also been used as the setting for a Sherlock Holmes mystery with Robert Downey Jnr and Jude Law being filmed on Stanley Dock in 2011.</p>
