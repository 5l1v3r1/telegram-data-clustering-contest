      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal as reigning champions Portugal secured their place at the <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/football/euro-2020-takes-shape-as-netherlands-germany-and-croatia-qualify-2133793">Euro 2020</a> finals on Sunday with a 2-0 victory away to Luxembourg. Bruno Fernandes struck the opening goal on 39 minutes before Ronaldo tapped in a scrappy second late on to clinch second place in Group B behind winners Ukraine, who drew 2-2 in Serbia.</p>
      <p>Portugal became the 17th nation to qualify for next year's multi-host tournament, which kicks off in Rome on June 12, joining the likes of world champions France, Spain, Italy and England.Â </p>
      <p>Fernando Santos' side knew they would book their place at Euro 2020 with a win or by matching Serbia's result from their game in Belgrade.</p>
      <p>But Portugal were made to work hard on a heavy pitch by a Luxembourg team ranked 96th in the world that notably held France to a 0-0 draw in 2018 World Cup qualifying.</p>
      <p>Sporting Lisbon midfielder Fernandes broke the deadlock before half-time, controlling Bernardo Silva's pinpoint pass expertly before lashing in from 20 yards.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo, who smacked in a <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/football/portugal-vs-lithuania-cristiano-ronaldo-hat-trick-fires-portugal-to-brink-of-euro-2020-qualification-2132835">hat-trick in Thursday's 6-0 thrashing of Lithuania</a>, moved to the brink of his international century four minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Silva's far-post cross was forced towards goal by Diogo Jota, with Anthony Moris getting a hand to the ball before Ronaldo turned in from the goalline.</p>
      <p>Iranian striker Ali Daei holds the world record with 109 international goals scored between 1993 and 2006.</p>
