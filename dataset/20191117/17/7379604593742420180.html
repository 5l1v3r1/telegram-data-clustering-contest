As always, the two couples with the lowest combined scores from the viewers and judges will face the dreaded dance off and one couple will be eliminated.</li>

Tonight, seven couples will become six but who is in trouble? Michelle Visage and Giovanni Pernice finished last on the leaderboard with their couples choice dance to Madonna's Vogue, whilst Chris Ramsey could also face the dance off after scoring 33 points out of 40 and finishing second from the bottom of the leaderboard.</li>

We'll return with more live blogging goodness or tragedy depending on how the spoiler goes tomorrow.</li>

Before we know it we'll have a new Strictly champion (It'll be Kelvin even though Michelle deserves it too) and probably a new Government. And then it'll be Christmas and we've all got lots of shopping to do. These Christmas adverts aren't helping, we'll all be weeping down the aisles of John Lewis (other departent stores are available, bizarrely given the state of them but there we go) trying to find an automatic sprout peeler and a teacup in the right shade of mauve.</li>

And now she's gone quiet for the last 16 minutes so I'm thinking/terrified she's in the dance off. Jessica Fletcher has nothing on me.</li>
