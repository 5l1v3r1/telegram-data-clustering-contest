      <h1>Nearly 80 per cent nominated posts are vacant</h1>
      <h2>Aspirants may have to wait till the conclusion of municipal elections, say sources</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:05:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/N-Rahul-376/" target="_blank">N. Rahul</a></address>
      <p>The recent filling of a few nominated posts by the State government has once again raised high hopes among aspirants after a long lull in the matter, which left them disappointed.</p>
      <p>There are about 50 State-level corporations but chairperson posts of nearly 80 per cent of them have fallen vacant by October-end either due to completion of term of incumbents or resignation. About 10 chairpersons tendered resignation when they contested elections to the Assembly or the Lok Sabha. Barring a few, the government has not filled the posts since the TRS returned to power for the second term in December last.</p>
      <p>The nomination of MLC Palla Rajeswara Reddy as chairman of State-level farmersâ€™ coordination committee, Mr. V. Pratap Reddy as chairman of the Forest Development Corporation and reappointment of Mr. A. Venkateswara Reddy as chairman of Sports Authority of Telangana State raised hopes that the government had set the ball rolling. However, sources said the aspirants may have to wait till the conclusion of municipal elections. They included leaders who are seeking a second term and others who were idle without posts. Former ministers, former MLAs and leaders who lost elections formed part of this long list.</p>
      <p>Apart from Mr. Venkateswara Reddy, those who were renominated included Civil Supplies Corporation chairman M. Srinivas Reddy, Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation chairman G. Balamallu, Telangana State Medical Services Infrastructure Development Corporation chairman Pariyada Krishnamurthy, Press Academy chairman Allam Narayana and Grandhalaya Samstha chairman Sridhar. But, many others who served one and even two terms, are lobbying for renomination. They are making frantic efforts to corner the posts, sources said.</p>
      <p>They said Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao assured a dozen senior leaders, who expected ministerial posts, of getting priority in nominated posts when the expansion of Cabinet took place in September first week. As a result, leaders like Mr. Kadiam Srihari, Mr. Nayini Narasimha Reddy, Mr. Jogu Ramanna and Ms. Padma Devender Reddy nursed hopes. Even the losers in elections like Mr. Chandulal, Mr. Tummala Nageswara Rao, Mr. P. Mahender Reddy and Mr. S. Madhusudanachary expected a call.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, only three posts of corporation chairmen are of Cabinet rank while the remaining had no special status. The Cabinet rank posts were the vice-chairmanship of State Planning Board which went to former Karimnagar MP B. Vinod Kumar after he lost elections and vice-chairmanship of Mission Bhagiratha, a post that is vacant after the resignation of Mr.V. Prashant Reddy who later became Minister. The newly appointed chairman, Mr. Palla Rajeswara Reddy, also holds Cabinet rank.</p>
      <p>There were about 4,000 other nominated posts of chairmen and directors of temple and market committees and Grandhalaya Samsthas which were being filled on recommendations of Ministers and MLAs.</p>
