      <p>More than a dozen employees with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">Pennsylvania's Department of Corrections</a> have been suspended after an inmate died during a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">fight with another inmate</a> last week, officials said.</p>
      <p>Tyrone Briggs, 29, died Nov. 11 after a brawl ensued between him and another inmate near the housing unit at the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/pennsylvania">in Frackville</a>.</p>

      <p>As Briggs was "waiting to be processed into the restricted housing unit," he became unresponsive, the department said in a <a href="https://www.media.pa.gov/Pages/corrections_details.aspx?newsid=439">news release</a>. Briggs was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health">pronounced dead</a> less than two hours later.</p>

      <p>"Whatever the outcome of this case, we are going to be as transparent as possible, and the DOC will take whatever remedial measures deemed to be necessary," Wetzel said, noting what happened at the Mahanoy facility "should not tarnish" other correctional employees.</p>
