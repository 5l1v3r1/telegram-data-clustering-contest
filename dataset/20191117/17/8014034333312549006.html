      <p>BOZEMAN, Mont. — The National Park Service reviewing a proposal from a wireless network company that wants to install Wi-Fi in the developed areas of Yellowstone National Park.</p>
      <p>The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports that AccessParks has proposed upgrading internet infrastructure all over the park within buildings managed by another company that operates several of Yellowstone’s historic hotels.</p>
      <p>A park document detailing some of the work says the proposed “large-scale wireless communication system” that would cover Canyon Village, Grant Village, Lake, Old Faithful and Mammoth Hot Springs. It would boost internet access for park employees and guests.</p>
      <p>It would involve installing antennas and transceivers but doesn’t call for any new towers or getting internet service into backcountry areas.</p>
      <p>Public comment on the proposal is being accepted until Nov. 29.</p>
