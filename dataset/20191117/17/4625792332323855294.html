      <h1>Chris Wallace hits Steve Scalise for dismissing 'Schiff's witnesses'</h1>

      <p><i>Fox News Sunday </i>anchor Chris Wallace knocked Republican Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise for dismissing the relevancy of new testimony in the impeachment proceedings against President Trump.</p>
      <p>Wallace brought up the new revelations from U.S. diplomat to Ukraine <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-live-house-impeachment-testimony-day-one">William Taylor's</a> testimony in front of the House Intelligence Committee last Wednesday. He spoke about an aide, David Holmes, who overheard a conversation between Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Trump in which Sondland allegedly agreed that Trump doesn't care about fighting Ukrainian corruption.</p>
      <p>Scalise responded to the new information by arguing that Trump still made decisions to help fight Russian incursion. He then denigrated Taylor and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, because their accounts focus on secondhand and thirdhand knowledge.</p>
      <p>Wallace, who previously called Taylor's testimony "<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/chris-wallace-impeachment-witness-william-taylor-was-very-damaging-to-the-president">very damaging</a>," commented, "If Gordon Sondland, who met with the president a half-dozen times this summer, testifies on Wednesday, yes, the president said to me we are not releasing the aid until they announce they are going to investigate the Bidens and Burisma. Doesn’t that blow a hole in the president’s defense?”</p>
      <p>Scalise insisted that his theory was fictitious, which then prompted Wallace to point out that “a dozen people listened in on the phone call, and a number of them were immediately upset because of what the president said.”</p>
      <p>Scalise then called them "Schiff's witnesses."</p>
      <p>“No, sir,” Wallace countered. “They are career foreign service officers, and these are people who worked in the Trump administration.”</p>
      <p>Sondland will publicly testify on Wednesday.</p>
