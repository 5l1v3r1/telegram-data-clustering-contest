      <p>Millennials and Gen Zs now make up half of the earth's population. Together, they account for most of the global workforce. What they think, believe, buy and do or don't do is disrupting old norms and transforming society. Growing up in a world of accelerated transformation leaves millennials and Gen Zs feeling unsettled about the future. Despite global economic growth, expansion and opportunity, younger generations are wary about the world and their place in it. This uncertainty is reflected in their personal views on business, government, leadership and the need for positive societal change agents. But they remain hopeful and lean on their values as both consumers and employees.</p>
      <p>This panel discussion will address the urgent need for business and government to work collaboratively to support and empower gen Z and millennials. How will business and government bear the shared social responsibility to prepare the next generation of young people for the future? How can they empower women and girls? How can institutions join forces to regain the trust of this critical cohort and future through education, skills-building initiatives and beyond.</p>

      <p>The Reykjavik Index for Leadership asks the question: how comfortable is society with women as leaders? The evidence it provides illuminates the extent of prejudice against female leadership across multiple economic sectors, in government, politics and business, and in every country in the world so far studied. This panel discussion brings together leaders with international experience in government, civil society and business to discuss how to we can move beyond the evidence and acknowledge that public policy is not enough. From how we manage everyday prejudice in the workplace, to how we can bring about change in society and in the home, our panelists will discuss their professional and personal perspectives on how we confront this aspect of social and economic discrimination and shape a better future.</p>

      <p>GBV is a pandemic. It defies geographic, social and economic boundaries. The consequences for equity, health and economies? Dire. Voices break silence: 1 of every 5 women report being sexually abused as children. Over one billion people - 1/3 of women and girls - experience GBV in their lifetime. The immediate cost: 2% of GDP. An annual loss of US$1.6 trillion, equivalent to throwing away the economies of Spain and Portugal. What is the cost-of-inaction? The SDGs? The long-term, inter- generational burden is huge. Yet, so are the benefits of halting GBV. How? Interventions spanning prevention to survivorship that take an all-of-society approach, inclusive of children and all gender identities. What will spur legislators, finance ministers, and heads-of-state to invest the resources to halt this pandemic? Do we have the knowledge to invest resources effectively? What are the promising strategies and opportunities for action? Our discussion will help launch the new Lancet Commission on Gender-based Violence.</p>
