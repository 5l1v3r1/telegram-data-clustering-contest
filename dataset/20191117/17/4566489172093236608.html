      <h1>Maduro says military personnel jailed for alleged plots</h1>

      <p>Venezuelan military personnel have been jailed in recent months for allegedly supporting US and Colombian efforts to overthrow the government, President Nicolas Maduro said in a television interview aired Sunday.</p>
      <p>Maduro did not say how many members of the military had been arrested, and provided only a sketchy description of the alleged plots in the interview with private channel Televen.</p>
      <p>But he said the armed forces had "dismembered" more than 47 attempts to recruit officials "to put them at the service of the strategy of Colombia and the gringos."</p>
      <p>"There are people in jail because of that. Some gave way and were bought and simply were discovered or intercepted with information from patriotic officials," he said.</p>
      <p>He said they were recruited to "steal missiles" and attempt to sabotage Sukhoi aircraft and radars, as well as naval torpedoes and missile defense systems.</p>
      <p>Foro Penal, a human rights monitor, says there are 399 political prisoners in Venezuela, including 109 members of the military.</p>
      <p>Maduro's comments came against the backdrop of the resignation in Bolivia of Evo Morales, a close ally of Venezuela's leftist regime.</p>
      <p>Morales lost support of the military and resigned November 10 following three weeks of violent unrest over contested election results.</p>
      <p>The Venezuelan opposition has taken heart from Morales's departure from power after 14 years, but Maduro said such a scenario would not be repeated in his country.</p>
      <p>The military "will not kneel ever again before the gringos, nor is it ever again going to put itself at the service of the oligarchy of this country," he said.</p>
      <p>He said "permanent intelligence" is in place to detect attempts to "divide and weaken" the armed forces, whose support is considered crucial to his government's hold on power.</p>
