      <p>Jay-Z reportedly pushed for the league to give Colin Kaepernick a chance to show himself off to many NFL teams, but it sounds like the hip-hop mogul isn’t happy about how things went down on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Complex Sports says Jay-Z thinks the entire thing turned into a PR stunt when it was all said and done.</p>

      <blockquote>“A source close to the situation tells Complex JAY-Z feels disappointed with Colin’s actions and believes he turned a legitimate workout into a publicity stunt.”</blockquote>
      <p>The workout was originally scheduled at the Falcons practice facility, but last minutes changes from Kapernick and his team had the workout at a high school that was 60 miles away in Riverdale, Georgia. The changes were because Kaepernick wanted to allow media coverage during the session as the workout at the training facility would have been closed to journalists.</p>

      <p>“Our biggest thing with everything today was making sure we had transparency with what went on. We weren’t getting that elsewhere so we came out here,” Kaepernick told the media. “We appreciate what y’all do. We appreciate y’all being here today. We appreciate the work y’all do for the people and telling the truth.”</p>
      <p>The NFL promised that 25 teams were present but onyl eight teams made it to Riverdale to see Kaepernick’s performance.</p>

      <p>Kaepernick’s move led ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith to believe that the quarterback’s main focus isn’t football.</p>

      <p>“He don’t want to play,” Smith said close to two minutes into his video. “He wants to be a martyr,” Smith said. “But guess what, it ain’t working this time.”</p>
      <p>“This man wanted a chance. Twenty-five teams show up in Georgia at the Atlanta Falcons practice facility—state of the art facility, NFL personnel, equipment, video, everything, and what does Colin Kaepernick do? Because of some issue with a liability waiver, Colin Kaepernick wants to change the venue,” Smith said. “You don’t want to work. You just want to make noise and you want to control the narrative.”</p>
      <p>Eric Reid, who was in attendance for Kaepernick’s workout, fired back at Smith.</p>
