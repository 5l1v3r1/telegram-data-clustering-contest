      <h1>Bloomberg apologizes for stop-and-frisk policy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:13:03+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:13</time> by <a rel="author">Carl Campanile and Aaron Feis</a></address>
      <p>Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg apologized for his administration’s controversial reliance on stop-and-frisk policing in a speech at a Brooklyn church Sunday morning, saying, “I was wrong and I am sorry.”</p>
      <p>The stunning reversal comes as Bloomberg is expected to jump into the 2020 presidential race.</p>
      <p>“I got something important wrong. I got something really important wrong — stops on the black and Latino community,” a contrite Bloomberg said as he addressed congregants at the Christian Cultural Center in East New York, one of the city’s largest black churches.</p>
      <p>“I want you to know I realize back then I was wrong,” he added. “And I am sorry.”</p>
      <p>Stop-and-frisk is one of the most controversial legacies of Bloomberg’s twelve years in City Hall — struck down by a federal judge for its disproportionate effect on minority communities, but one Bloomberg continued to cling tightly to for years as he claimed credit of the city’s sinking crime rates.</p>
      <p>As recently as January, Bloomberg defended the policy in a question-and-answer segment at the US Naval Academy’s 2019 Leadership Conference, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/22/politics/bloomberg-stop-and-frisk/index.html">according to CNN</a>.</p>
      <p>“We focused on keeping kids from going through the correctional system. … Kids who walked around looking like they might have a gun, remove the gun from their pockets and stop it,” he said at the time, noting that the tactic more than halved the city’s murder rate on his watch.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Bloomberg continued to insist that he had pure intentions, but admitted for the first time that he and the NYPD under his watch went about it the wrong way.</p>
      <p>“Our focus was on saving lives,” he told the congregation. “The fact is, far too many innocent people were being stopped while we tried to do that. … That may have included, I’m sorry to say, some of you here today.”</p>
      <p>The apology is a bombshell course-correction amid the recent dramatic shift in the national debate — and in the Democratic Party — over criminal justice policy, which is fueled by concerns about the costs and implications of aggressive policing and incarceration.</p>
      <p>It comes as Bloomberg appears <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/bloomberg-files-paperwork-for-democratic-primary-in-arkansas/">poised to jump into the crowded Democratic presidential competition</a> to challenge President Trump in 2020.</p>
      <p>As he first took the temperature of this election cycle’s candidate pool in a <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/12/04/bloombergs-iowa-speech-met-by-wave-of-left-wing-protesters/">December 2018 event in Iowa</a>, Bloomberg found himself haunted by the policy.</p>
      <p>But with his 2020 plans seemingly crystalizing, Bloomberg on Sunday reckoned with stop-and-frisk.</p>
      <p>The former three-term mayor said his preoccupation with driving down crime across the city blinded him to how the aggressive policy of police stops “eroded” trust between police and the city’s black and Latino communities.</p>
      <p>“We had eroded what we worked so hard to build: trust,” he said.</p>
