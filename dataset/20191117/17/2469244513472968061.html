      <p>A woman was taken to hospital after collapsing under a tree at an <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/all-about/exeterhttps-wwwdevonlivecom-all-about-exeter">Exeter</a> playing fields.</p>
      <p>The air ambulance landed at Exhibition Playing Fields at around 9.30am on Sunday, with paramedics seen surrounding a tree and bushes in the area.</p>
      <p>A land ambulance also attended the incident, before the casualty was taken to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital.</p>
      <p>A South Western Ambulance Service spokesperson told Devon Live: “We were called at 9.28am on Sunday, November 17 after a female collapsed. </p>
      <p>“We conveyed her to hospital for further treatment.”</p>

      <p>An eyewitness described seeing the air ambulance land in the field from her house in the area.</p>
      <p>The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, originally thought someone had spotted an injured animal in the bushes.</p>
      <p>She said: “I opened the curtains at around 9.30am which overlooks the playing fields where they normally play football.</p>
      <p>“But then I noticed two lads with their dad were looking down at the bushes under a tree.</p>
      <p>“I thought they were looking at an animal at first.</p>
      <p>“But it was definitely a person, possibly a woman.</p>

      <p>“The air ambulance landed nearby and paramedics wheeled her off.</p>
      <p>“It was very distressing to see this right outside my back door.</p>
      <p>“It happened under a tree amongst the bushes.</p>
      <p>“They stopped a jogger to help the woman.</p>
      <p>“I would say the air ambulance was there for around an hour.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t see any police there.”</p>
