      <h1>Iranian Hulk Signs Up To Bare-Knuckle Boxing Championship And Is Looking For An Opponent</h1>

        <b>The Iranian Hulk has joined the Bare-Knuckle Boxing Championship – but he’s still searching for his first opponent. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Sajad Gharibi has long circulated the web, earning his superhero title for his outrageous, near inhuman physique.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old is also known as the Persian Hercules. With that in mind, do you reckon you could take him in a fight?</p>

      <p>At 390lb and 6ft 2in, he’s an absolute monster of a man, weighing roughly the same as a killer whale calf.</p>
      <p>Gharibi is the latest signing by the American fighting organisation, and is expected to make his debut in the ring sometime in 2020.</p>
      <p>The Iranian Hulk previously said in 2016 that he’d join military forces to help fight the so-called Islamic State.</p>

      <p>However, in January, he announced his interest in MMA fighting and used Instagram – where he has nearly 45,000 followers – to invite people to get in the ring with him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>He wrote: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Be brave and invite me to fight, rather than hiding behind your sponsors. I am ready to fight you, show me what you’ve got to say in the ring.</blockquote>
      <p>It took a while, but in May, someone finally stepped up. Gharibi wrote: ‘So I’m finally accepting my first professional fight from a Brazilian fighter before 2020.’</p>

      <p>However, the hype for the fight was over too quickly; he was widely speculated to be fighting 29-year-old Romario dos Santos Alves, also known as the Brazilian Hulk.</p>
      <p>The pair have a bit of a history: in March this year, he threatened to ‘tear off’ Gharibi’s head in an online video. However, he only weighs 229lb, so it’s not exactly the fairest match-up.</p>

      <p>In July this year, Gharibi wrote on Instagram his Brazilian counterpart refused to fight him in the cage.</p>
      <p>Let’s hope the Iranian Hulk finds his Abomination soon.</p>

      <p>After graduating from Glasgow Caledonian University with an NCTJ and BCTJ-accredited Multimedia Journalism degree, Cameron ventured into the world of print journalism at The National, while also working as a freelance film journalist on the side, becoming an accredited Rotten Tomatoes critic in the process. He’s now left his Scottish homelands and took up residence at UNILAD as a journalist.</p>
