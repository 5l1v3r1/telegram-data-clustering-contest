      <h1>'Correction' - Wolves fans all saying the same thing about Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>
      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers latest | There were four Wolves players involved as Portugal secured their Euro 2020 place - and Diogo Jota came so close to his first international goal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:07:37+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:07</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Murray</a></address>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers fans are having their say after Cristiano Ronaldo's 99th international goal helped Portugal secure their qualification for next summer's European Championship finals.</p>
      <p>The reigning European champions won 2-0 away to Luxembourg in group B to make sure they will be in the running to defend their title in 2020 - and there were a quartet of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> stars on the field by the end of the game.</p>
      <p>Rui Patricio played the full 90 minutes in goal, while Ruben Neves, Joao Moutinho and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/diogo-jota">Diogo Jota</a> all came off the bench.</p>
      <p>It was Jota's involvement that got Wolves supporters talking in the immediate aftermath, as the forward came close to registering his first goal for Portugal's senior side with a close-range chance, only for captain Ronaldo to tap the loose ball home from barely a yard out in the 86th minute.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>That came after Bruno Fernandes' 39th-minute opener.</p>
      <p>Here is what has been said on social media as Jota came agonisingly close to his debut international strike...</p>
      <p><b>Peter Corbett:</b> Correction: Ronaldo cruelly steals what would have been Diogo’s first goal for Portugal</p>
      <p><b>Stuart Mole:</b> Gutted for Diogo, but any good striker would do what Ronaldo did. That's why he's on 99</p>
      <p><b>@SiobhanC1:</b> Cristiano totally stole Jota's goal that was going to go in!</p>
      <p><b>Roy Richardson:</b> Trust Ronaldo to pinch Diogo’s debut goal</p>
      <p><b>Paul Nicholls:</b> Jota would have done the same</p>

      <p><b>@wolfinbristol:</b> Ultimate team player????</p>
      <p><b>Brian Myrie:</b> Jota in the right place at the right time, he will score many goals for Portugal, he has pace, skill and an eye for goal. Ronaldo was right to knock it over the line, Portugal needed to win and Ronaldo made sure with the added bonus he gets 99 International goals.</p>
      <p><b>Mathew Howell:</b> All 4 on the pitch at the end. So so proud. Ronaldo stole Jota's goal!! Portugal definitely my 2nd team at Euro 2020. #wolvesaythey</p>
