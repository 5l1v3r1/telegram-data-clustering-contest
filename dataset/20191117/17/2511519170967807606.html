      <p>A seven-year-old girl has launched a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/petition">petition</a> asking Crayola UK to make its colouring pens recyclable. </p>
      <p>Jessie Stephenson, who has a passion for art, recently became upset when she discovered her favourite pens could not be <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Recycling">recycled</a>.</p>
      <p>The schoolgirl, from Brockley, London, decided to write to Crayola UK in a bid to encourage the handicraft company to consider how its customers can dispose of their used pens without impacting the environment.</p>
      <p>Stephenson also launched a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/crayola-uk-get-crayola-to-introduce-felt-tip-pen-recycling-in-the-uk">Change.org petition</a> with a goal of hitting 75,000 signatures. </p>
      <p>“I really love using Crayola pens but I don’t want to use them now that I know the impact on the environment,” Stephenson wrote in the petition.</p>

      <p>“I care about the environment because we live here and if we wreck it, we won’t get a second chance.”</p>
      <p>She continued: “I think if everyone tries to do something little, we can make a better world for us to live in.</p>
      <p>“Please Crayola will you introduce a pen recycling scheme in the UK, like you have in America. Then we can carry on colouring in without feeling guilty!”</p>
      <p>Stephenson’s petition has quickly racked up 70,000 signatures and prompted Crayola UK to respond with a letter.</p>
      <p>However, Stephenson was not happy with the company’s reply, which failed to acknowledge her request for a meeting.</p>
      <p>She has since published a short video in which she encourages more people to sign the petition and force Crayola UK to implement change.</p>
      <p>“I wrote to Crayola to ask them to start recycling pens and to meet with me to talk about it,” Stephenson said.</p>

      <p>“They sent me a letter back but I am not happy. They are not promising anything and ignored that I want to meet with them.</p>
      <p>“But I am not giving up! Please will you share this video so we can show Crayola how much it means to us and get more people to sign.”</p>
      <p>The young girl’s headteacher, Sue Harte, has praised her determination, adding that the entire school is proud to support Stephenson’s cause.</p>
      <p>“I am absolutely delighted that Jessie has been so motivated to do this petition to convince Crayola start recycling in the UK,” Harte said.</p>
      <p>“How wonderful that such a young child has the awareness and the drive to do something to make the world better and the support for her has been fantastic.</p>
      <p>“We are very proud as a school to be totally supporting Jessie’s petition.”</p>

      <p>MP Vicky Foxcroft has also given her support to Jessie’s campaign, saying: ”Climate change is one of the main issues young people contact me about. </p>
      <p>“It’s their future they are worried about and it’s great to see them lobbying for change.”</p>
      <p><i>The Independent</i> has contacted Crayola UK for comment.</p>
