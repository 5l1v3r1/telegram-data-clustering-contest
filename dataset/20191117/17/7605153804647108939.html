        <b>TIRANA, Albania, Nov 17 – UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin on Sunday made light of his predecessor Michel Platini’s return to football next week, saying the Frenchman could take any role except that of a player.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Four years after Platini’s ban from all football-related activities for financial wrongdoing, the former UEFA boss is free to work in the sport again on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Ceferin was asked about Platini at Tirana Sunday where he was watching France play Albania in their Euro 2020 qualifier.</p>
      <p>“Michel Platini’s ban is over. So he can be part in any role in football except as a football player, I think he is a bit old,” Ceferin said of the 64-year-old.</p>
      <p>Platini is on record this week as tantalisingly saying there would be no rush as elections for top roles at FIFA and UEFA are “some years ahead”.</p>
      <p>Platini told Swiss television channel RTS in September that he “will be back”.</p>
      <p>The former France captain was banned in 2015 for receiving a two-million Swiss francs (1.8 million euros, $2 million) payment from ex-FIFA chief Sepp Blatter, who was himself suspended for six years.</p>
      <p>“I will be back. I don’t know where, I don’t know how. I can’t stay on the suspension, even if it’s a suspension made by idiots,” Platini said.</p>
      <p>“I was a victim of a form of a plot, yes, totally, between those at FIFA and those at the Swiss public ministry. There was an agreement between FIFA and them to sack me. I’m not going to say it was a plot by the Swiss state,”</p>
