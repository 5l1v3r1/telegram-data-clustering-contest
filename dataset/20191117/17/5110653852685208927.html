      <p>The Cowboys are back on the road in <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-schedule-week-11-games-today-tv-channels-times-scores/r0rlms6mlk3l1finrne3igfiu">Week 11</a>, looking to pick up their first NFC North victory of the season after dropping earlier games this season to the Packers and Vikings. Detroit is up next, hoping to gain some traction after dropping five of its last six games.</p>
      <p>The Lions will have to do it without quarterback Matthew Stafford, who missed the team's loss to the Bears last week with a back injury. Jeff Driskel, who went for 269 yards with a touchdown and an interception in Week 10, will start in Stafford's absence.</p>
