      <h1>Baby dies in Moria migrant camp, MSF reveals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:57:02+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:57</time> by <a rel="author">Euronews </a></address>
      <p>A nine-month-old baby has died of "severe dehydration" at the Moria migrant camp on the Greek island of Lesbos, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"We are absolutely devastated by this tragedy," MSF wrote on Twitter. The news of the tragic incident was confirmed by the camp's administration.</p>
      <p>The child from the Congo was sent to an oncologist on November 10, who diagnosed symptoms of dehydration, possibly as a result of pathological causes.</p>
      <p>The infant was then transferred to the nearby Mytilene Hospital but passed away before arriving. A forensic examiner has been tasked with confirming cause of death.</p>
      <p>According to MSF, 15,000 people currently reside in the Moria camp — about five times its maximum capacity — including 5,000 minors.</p>
      <p>"They should be removed out of this hell now," the NGO urged.</p>
