      <p>Atlanta producer Lil Jon was freed from a jail in Vietnam after he was caught with too much jewelry.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Rapper Lil Jon could have easily ended up on an episode of "Locked Up Abroad" in Vietnam over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The superstar Atlanta rapper ran into major problems at Tan Son Nhat International Airport after a performance in Saigon on Friday.</p>
      <p>As Lil Jon was attempting <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/16/lil-jon-detained-vietnam-jewelry/">to leave Vietnam</a>, he ran into issues because he was traveling with so much jewelry that it alarmed local TSA agents.</p>
      <p>Lil Jon, real name Jonathan Smith, posted footage of his problems with TSA to his Instagram account.</p>
      <p>"Vietnam got me hemmed up over my iceeeee smh," Lil Jon posted from the airport in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
      <p>Lil Jon was actually detained for a little while until the US embassy in Vietnam intervened on his behalf.</p>
      <p>The rap star eventually made it to China for a headlining show at Club Cubic in Macau.</p>
