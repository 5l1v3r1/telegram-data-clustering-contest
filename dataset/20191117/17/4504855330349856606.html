      <p>(CNN) — A massive crash sent 19 people to hospitals as thick fog and ice covered a Virginia highway Sunday.</p>
      <p>The crash happened around 4:30 a.m. on the eastbound lanes of Interstate 64 near the Nelson-Augusta county lines, Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corrine Geller said.</p>
      <p>“Heavy fog and icy road conditions are to blame,” Geller said.</p>
      <p>The driver of a tractor-trailer lost control, and the semi truck filled with mail overturned, state police said.</p>
      <p>A nearby charter bus wasn’t able to avoid the overturned semi and struck it.</p>
      <p>“The impact of the crash split the tractor-trailer in half,” Geller said. “The bus ran off the right side of the highway and came to rest against the guardrail.”</p>
      <p>More than 20 people were on the Silver Lining Charters &amp; Tours bus, police said.</p>
      <p>At least 19 people were taken to hospitals, including the bus drier, Andrew L. Burruss, and the driver of the semi truck, James Proffitt.</p>
      <p>No fatalities were reported. The injuries of those hospitalized range from serious to minor.</p>
      <p>At least seven minor crashes followed in the same lanes as the major crash, state police said. No one was injured in those minor crashes.</p>
      <p>The Virginia State Police Motor Carrier Safety Team is assisting with the investigation. The US Postal Inspection Service also responded to the scene because the tractor-trailer was loaded with mail.</p>
