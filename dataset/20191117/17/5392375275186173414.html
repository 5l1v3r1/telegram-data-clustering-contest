      <p>After launching <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/30/xiaomi-mijia-induction-cooker-c1-launched-in-china-for-17/">Mijia Induction Cooker</a> last month, Xiaomi has now added yet another product to its growing lifestyle niche. The smartphone maker has recently launched <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/xiaomi/">Xiaomi</a> Warm Up Cup in its homeland i.e. China. The unique thing about this warm-up cup is the fact that it comes with wireless charging. This means that the warm-up cup will make use of the 10W wireless charging. The product can maintain a constant temperature of 55-degrees. In order to get the cup to work, you will have the place it on the wireless charger.</p>
      <p>According to the brand, this method of heating is much better than traditional wire heating methods. Well, the heating temperature remains stable in the former and is much safer. Above all, the user will not get any burn while handling the cup. You might be wondering whether there is any construction difference between this and traditional cups. Surprisingly, there is not. Xiaomi warm-up cup is made up of ceramic material which is quite common in the traditional cups. On the other hand, Xiaomi is touting a much more durable and safer experience. In fact, the entire cup is waterproof so you can wash it without worrying about the wireless charging support at the bottom.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the warm-up cup will enter sleep mode after 4 hours of inactivity meaning the product will not heat. This is done to keep the product safe from internal damages. Coming to the price tag, the product is up for grabs for a price tag of 189 Yuan (roughly $26). We are not expecting the product to hit the global market. Lastly, Xiaomi Warm Up Cup will work with any wireless charger that supports 10W output. This means that you can use wireless charging products from Xiaomi, Huawei, Apple, Samsung or any other third-party brand.Â In another development, Xiaomi is also planning to launch its first<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/15/xiaomi-teases-ereader-launch-on-november-20/"> e-reader</a> on November 20.</p>
