      <h1>Disney+ to Fix 'The Simpsons' Aspect Ratio Issue Next Year</h1>
      <h2>Earlier seasons of 'The Simpsons' will be offered in their original 4:3 aspect ratio in early 2020. Currently, Disney+ crops episodes and some viewers note that visual jokes are impossible to pick up on due to the 16:9 aspect ratio.</h2>

      <p>Soon you'll be able to stream episodes of 'The Simpsons' exactly how they were aired.</p>
      <p><a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/software/123534/disney">Disney+</a> holds streaming rights to the popular series, but earlier seasons aren't offered in the 4:3 aspect ratio. Instead, they're cropped to fit the 16:9 aspect ratio supported by new seasons and their episodes. <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/simpsons-disney-plus-original-aspect-ratio-uncropped-1203407099/">Variety reports</a> that, in early 2020, Disney+ will start offering all episodes in their original formats.</p>
      <p>It wouldn't be an issue for some series, but 'The Simpsons' relies on visual jokes throughout its episodes. In one example, <a href="https://twitter.com/TristanACooper/status/1194298167824650240/photo/2">Tristan Cooper</a> noted on Twitter a scene in which Duff beer flavors are all connected to the same tube. Disney+ cuts off the tube above each tank, though. If you watch the same episode in the 4:3 aspect ratio, you'll see the single source of Duff-branded beer and understand the joke.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, an error like this won't occur after Disney+ rolls out the fix. Just be patient as there isn't an exact date for when 'The Simpsons' will no longer force the 16:9 ration on episodes prior to 2009.</p>
      <p>"Over time, Disney+ will roll out new features and additional viewing options," The Walt Disney Company said in a statement. "As part of this, in early 2020, Disney+ will make the first 19 seasons (and some episodes from Season 20) of 'The Simpsons' available in their original 4:3 aspect ratio, giving subscribers choice of how they prefer to view the popular series."</p>
      <p>Disney+ limited all episodes to the 16:9 aspect ratio in order to remain consistent across all seasons.</p>
      <p>When FOX started airing 'The Simpsons' in 1989, it used the 4:3 aspect ratio to conform to 480i video resolution. The series switched over to the 16:9 aspect ratio a decade ago to match 1080p on HDTVs. Disney+ is capable of up to 4K HDR with some content, but fans of 'The Simpsons' simply want the glory days of 4:3 back. Eventually, they'll get just that through Disney+ alongside <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/netflix/120308/disney-hbo-max-the-new-streaming-giants-explained">a plethora of other content</a> to stream.</p>
