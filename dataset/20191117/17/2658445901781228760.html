      <h3>Kolade Adeyemi, Kano</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The federal government has earmarked over N4 billion for total reconstruction of the dilapidated Kano-Gwarzo-Dayi road, which had been neglected for a long time.</p>
      <p>The senator representing Kano North, Senator Barau Jibrin-Maliya, who disclosed this in an interview with The Nation in Kano on Sunday, expressed concerns over the deplorable condition of the road, which links Kano with Katsina, Sokoto, Zamfara and Kebbi states as well as the neighbouring Niger Republic.</p>
      <p>Jibrin-Maliya, who is the chairman Senate committee on Appropriation, said all arrangements had been concluded for immediate take-off of the reconstruction of the 70km road with initial release of N2 billion.</p>

      <p>According to him: “I have been engaging the Federal Government over the deteriorating condition of that important road adding that in the first quarter of 2020, the contract for the project will commence.”</p>
      <p>He added the bill for the road project is before the National Assembly and as such N2 billion would be provided for the award of the contract.</p>
      <p>He said the road, which suffered neglect for too long, when completed would boost social and economic activities of communities living along the the road and also the states that are linked to Kano state.</p>
      <p>The road, which had not witnessed any major rehabilitation since it was constructed by the administration of former Military President, General Ibrahim Babangida, when completed,  would reduce the number of accidents that are being recorded almost on daily basis.</p>
