      <h1>RWBY Cosplayers Can Purchase a Crescent Rose from Rooster Teeth Now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tommy Williams</a></address>
      <p>Rooster Teeth has launched a new official line of <b><i>RWBY</i></b> cosplay. Now, fans can purchase items for their cosplay including, but not limited to, Ruby’s cloak and an official Crescent Rose scythe. The scythe is made of EVA foam with metal rods for support and looks very impressive. Unfortunately, it cannot transform between scythe and sniper modes. However, it is 6’ 2” tall and comes shipped in three pieces in a custom box that includes all tools needed for assembly. The big catch for me is that <a href="https://store.roosterteeth.com/collections/cosplay/products/rwby-crescent-rose-cosplay-weapon">Crescent Rose</a> is about $400.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the cloak is made of wool and “[m]easure[s] 52" from the base on neck to longest part of cape.” You can purchase <a href="https://store.roosterteeth.com/collections/cosplay/products/rwby-rose-cloak">the cloak</a> for about $80.</p>
