      <h1>Congressman says fellow Democrats in Trump districts ‘quietly, privately’ fear impeachment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:28:28+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:28</time> by <a rel="author">Kerry Picket</a></address>
      <p>Democratic New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew revealed some Democrats in districts President Trump won are having second thoughts about impeachment.</p>
      <p>Van Drew, who joined Minnesota Rep. Colin Petersen as <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-think-its-going-to-fail-van-drew-and-peterson-break-with-democrats-on-impeachment-measure">the only two</a> Democrats to vote against the impeachment proceedings, told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday, "So I don't know how other folks will vote, because in all honesty, originally I thought there were going to be a few more. Not that it matters to me if I'm one or 101. I do what I believe is right. There is some discussion among some of them — quietly, privately — of concern, of concern."</p>
      <p>There are 31 <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/swing-district-democrat-says-enough-evidence-exists-to-impeach-trump">swing-districts</a> that Trump won in the 2016 presidential election, though other than Peterson and Van Drew, no other House Democrat has come out against impeachment.</p>
      <p>Van Drew, whose own congressional district has been dubbed a toss-up by the Cook Political Report, told the <i>Washington Examiner</i> on Thursday he is concerned that backlash could erupt from the impeachment proceedings that Democrats are leading in the House.</p>
      <p>"If it's not a true impeachment, if he is exonerated in the Senate, we are going to have the same president. And the same presidential candidate would have spent a boatload of money, an unbelievable amount of time, and not accomplished nearly as much work, as we would have liked to have done. So do I think that a [backlash] has potential? Yes."</p>
      <p>Impeachment hearings were open to the public last week with three witnesses openly testifying before the House Intelligence Committee. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house-democrats-move-ahead-with-impeachment-proceedings-despite-static-poll-numbers">Polls show</a> little movement on either side over whether President Trump should be impeached.</p>
      <p>Should Trump be impeached, Republicans in the Senate control the timeline over how long a trial can last, which could negatively affect <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/schumer-on-senate-trial-we-dont-want-it-truncated">2020 Democratic senators</a> running for the presidential nomination.</p>
