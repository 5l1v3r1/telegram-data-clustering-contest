      <p>Muscat: Leg-spin sensation Samay Srivastava powered Muscat CT to a stunning 2-wicket win over mighty Assarain while star left-arm pacer Bilal Khan bowled Passage to India (PTI) to a one-sided 10-wicket win over Renaissance in a pulsating Premier Division action at Oman Cricket grassy grounds in Amerat over the weekend.<br/><br/>Invited to bat first, Assarain was cruising at 77 without loss in 15 overs before Samay struck two quick blows, removing opener Ramkumar Pandarathil (40 off 55) and Kail Khalid (15 off 12) in successive overs.<br/><br/>Assarain never really recovered and was dismissed for 186 in the 43rd over, Samay taking 5 for 34 and Sidhharth Prasad claiming 3 for 39. Gastav Burger (41) and Zeeshan Maqsood (35) were the other main scorers for Assarain.<br/><br/>Facing a modest target, Muscat was made to sweat for every single run as Rafiullah picked up 5 for 43. However, a 39-run unbroken ninth wicket partnership between Sidharth Prasad (24 not out) and Pranav Athawale (16 not out) saw Muscat home in the 49th over as it reached 187 for 8. Shoaib Khan (39 off 77) and Khizar Anwar (28 off 43) were its topscorers.</p>
      <p>Brief Scores (Premier Division): Assarain 186 all out in 42.4 overs (Gastav Burger 41 – 5x4, Ramkumar Pandarathil 40 – 6x4, Zeeshan Maqsood 35 – 1x4, Samay Srivastava 5-34, Siddharth Prasad 3-39) lost to Muscat CT 187 for 8 in 48.1 overs (Shoaib Khan 39 – 2x4, Khizar Anwar 28 – 3x4, Rafi Ullah 5-43) by 2 wickets.<br/><br/><b>PTI too good for Renaissance</b><br/><br/><br/><br/>Fast bowler Bilal Khan picked up 7 wickets for only 8 runs as PTI handed Renaissance a 10-wicket drubbing on Friday. Renaissance found Bilal unplayable before being bundled out for a meagre 34 in the 16th over. Muhammed Bilal bagged 2 for 21.<br/><br/>It took PTI less than seven overs to overhaul the target, scoring 38 without loss as openers Syed Zain (23) and Zohaib Amanat (14) remained not out.<br/><br/>Brief Scores (Premier League): Renaissance 34 all out in 15.2 overs (Waruna Sajith 17 – 3x4, Bilal Khan 7-8, Muhammad Bilal 2-21) lost to Passage To India 38 for no loss in 6.5 overs (Syed Zain 23 – 3x4, Zohaib Amanat 14 – 1x4, 1x6) by 10 wickets.</p>
