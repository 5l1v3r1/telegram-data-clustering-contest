      <h1>Rail users call for early commencement of Karaikal-Peralam new line project</h1>
      <h2>Sanctioned by the Railway Board in January, it provides for a shorter route</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:02:48+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:02</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>With the Railway Board sanctioning funds for a new broad gauge line from Karaikal to Peralam early this year, rail users in Nagore and Nagapattinam have appealed for early commencement of the project.</p>
      <p>A memorandum containing the plea and a few others was submitted by members of Nagore–Nagapattinam Rail Users Association to Nagapattinam Lok Sabha member M. Selvaraj. They appealed to him to take up the issue.</p>
      <p>In late January, the Railway Board sanctioned a detailed estimate for laying a new line between Karaikal and Peralam (23 km) as material modification to gauge conversion of Tiruchi–Nagore–Karaikal with extension of Nagapattinam–Velankanni-Tiruturaipundi.</p>
      <p>While according sanction, the Railway Board allocated ₹177. 69 crore, giving a break-up of amounts allocated for civil, electrical, signal and telecommunication works besides yard arrangement at Peralam.</p>
      <p>The approval for the project came following persistent demands from rail users for restoration of Karaikal–Peralam rail link. A metre gauge line was in existence for several years from Karaikal to Peralam via the temple town of Tirunallar and Ambagarathur. The services were suspended in the mid-1980s and the railway track was dismantled thereafter.</p>
      <p>The sanction for the Karaikal–Peralam line project by the Railway Board gladdened rail users in Nagore, Karaikal and other areas in the vicinity.</p>
      <p>The new line provides a shorter route to Mayiladuthurai junction via Peralam from Karaikal in contrast to the circuitous route via Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur at present.</p>
      <p>Association members met Mr. Selvaraj on Saturday and apprised him of their demands, which included early commencement of the Karaikal–Peralam link project, said M. Mohamed Thaha Maricar, association president and resident of Nagore.</p>
      <p>A senior railway official said tenders had been finalised for the new project and work was expected to begin December-end.</p>
      <p>The association also appealed for operation of an early morning express train to Tiruchi junction from Karaikal, Nagore or Velankanni daily and from Tiruchi junction in the return direction in the evening. It also pleaded for an express train to southern districts via Thanjavur, Tiruchi, Dindigul and Madurai from Karaikal or Nagore.</p>
