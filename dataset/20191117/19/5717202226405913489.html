        <b><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10360897/arsenal-january-transfer-pau-torres/">According to a report from The Sun</a>, Arsenal have not been put off by Pau Torres’s £43 million release clause, and have a plan they hope will lead to his arrival at the Emirates.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, the Gunners appear to be prioritising their defence heading into the January transfer window. Unai Emery’s men have conceded 17 goals in just 12 games in the Premier League.</p>

      <p>They have not kept a clean sheet in any of their last seven games. And it appears that it is a situation that Emery is looking to rectify in January.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10360897/arsenal-january-transfer-pau-torres/">The Sun reports</a> that Torres is on the Gunners’ radar. The 22-year-old has started 13 top flight games for Villarreal this term, scoring one and providing one assist.</p>

      <p>The report notes that Torres – who is also wanted by Manchester City – has a £43 million release clause, and it would appear that the La Liga side would have little interest in letting him leave for anything less.</p>
      <p>But it seems that Arsenal are hoping that they may be able to convince El Submarino Amarillo to agree a deal that would see the Gunners pay a chunk of the total fee up front, before parting with the rest in instalments.</p>
      <p>The Sun reports that that is how they agreed a deal for Nicolas Pepe in the summer. Arsenal paid £20 million up front and will pay a further £52 million in future fees.</p>
      <p>Arsenal certainly need to make sure that they improve defensively. Booking a spot in next season’s Champions League is surely an absolute must if they hope to keep some of their key men happy.</p>
      <p>And as things stand, it is difficult to see that happen without their form improving at the back. Torres’s arrival will surely help. But Gunners fans would be forgiven for feeling that signing the youngster will not solve everything by any means.</p>
