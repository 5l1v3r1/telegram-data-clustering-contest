      <h1>Liverpool and Everton find common ground despite Toffees recording historic Merseyside derby victory</h1>
      <h2>Lucy Graham scored the only goal at Anfield as Everton Women came out on top against Liverpool Women</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:57:26+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:57</time> by <a rel="author">Kathryn Batte</a></address>
      <p>Lucy Graham was two years old when Everton last won at Anfield but today the Scottish midfielder gave the women's side a historic victory over their bitter rivals.</p>
      <p>It was a Scottish manager who guided the Blues to a 1-0 victory in 1999 - Walter Smith. Today it was Edinburgh-born Willie Kirk who led Everton to a win of the same margin.</p>
      <p>Perhaps it was written in the stars.</p>
      <p>Vicky Jepson's <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool </a>came into the game bottom of the table, with just one point and one goal in five league games.</p>
      <p>But the saying form goes out of the window in Merseyside derbies seemed to be ringing true the case with the Reds starting the better of the two teams.</p>
      <p>It took a stunning save from <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a>'s Tinja Korpela to deny Kirsty Linnett the opening goal in the 16th minute. Jepson was half-way to celebrating.</p>
      <p>Everton were missing their top scorer Chloe Kelly and her absence was felt. The Blues struggled in possession and Niamh Charles constantly caused problems down the left wing.</p>
      <p>But the Blues weathered the storm and with Liverpool lacking a clinical touch in the final third.</p>
      <p>It should have been 0-0 going into half-time but thirty yards out from goal Graham decided to try her luck. Her shot headed straight to Anke Preuss in the Reds goal as many of the crowd headed for the exits, expecting the referee's whistle.</p>
      <p>But somehow the ball squirmed away from German and found its way into the back of the net. The Blues almost looked unsure - it was a muted celebration from Graham who eventually ran over to the bench to give her manager a hug.</p>
      <p>Liverpool came out determined in the second half. The introduction of Rinsola Babjide provided more pace down the wing but cross after cross seemed to evade the Red shirts in the penalty area.</p>
      <p>Danielle Turner was on hand to produce a superb block from Charles and Gabby George was a strong presence in the air.</p>
      <p>The Blues defence held firm and almost claimed a breakaway goal through Molly Pike before the final whistle.</p>
      <p>But in the end one goal was enough and the Blues fans behind the goal roared as their team claimed a historic victory.</p>
      <p>"It means a lot to the club, it's been a long time since an Everton team has won at Anfield," said manager Willie Kirk.</p>
      <p>"The atmosphere here was fantastic, it actually felt like about 50,000 fans were there.</p>

      <p>"It means a lot to the players and supporters that we can see there. It's good to get a victory when you're not at your best.</p>
      <p>"I thought we were at our best in the second half in terms of character, in terms of defending our area. When 11 Liverpool players are coming at you and the Kop are behind you, it must be quite daunting but we held on."</p>
      <p>Kirk said before the game that his side was better than Liverpool but he recognised they had been in a fight.</p>
      <p>"I said before they were in a false position, I still believe that.," he added.</p>
      <p>"The first half was disappointing but one thing we did say, for Lucy Graham especially was we need more goals from you and if you get a chance to shoot, shoot.</p>

      <p>"If Chloe had scored anymore goals for us people would have started thinking we were just relying on Chloe so it was important that we won without her. I think the back four and goalkeeper deserve an awful lot of the headlines today, they've done fantastically well. They've pulled off a very impressive clean sheet.</p>
      <p>"We've probably got a few rubs of the green, I'm not scared to accept or admit that. That happens, I was on the reverse side of that last year."</p>
      <p>For Liverpool manager Vicky Jepson it was a case of what could have been.</p>
      <p>"It's gonna hurt us more because we were the better team here today," she said.</p>
      <p>"There's no question about that. We give them a goal with a mistake from our keeper which Anke is obviously gutted about and we'll have to work to keep her head high because it was a goal that we chucked in the back of our net.</p>
      <p>"They weren't gonna score today, there was no way. Our out of possession intensity was fantsatic, our game plan was perfect, we just needed to find the back of the net.</p>

      <p>"I'm really proud of our performance because that earns more fans to keep coming back and watch us.</p>
      <p>"Every single one of our players and the ones that came on and didn't get the opportunity to come one were outstanding today and I'm really proud of them wearing that badge today.</p>
      <p>"Because there was only one badge that out-shined the other today and that was the Liverpool badge and I'm really proud of every single one of them today."</p>
      <p>What both managers could agree on was the significance of the attendance and what it can mean for the women's game going forward.</p>
      <p>"I think if we can be standing here on a regular basis and talking about averages instead of one offs, I think that's where the game is going building into the Olympics and and a home Euros is exciting for everybody," said Kirk</p>
      <p>"If we can transfer that into our club attendances I think that will probably put the women's game where it should be in three or four years time.</p>
      <p>"It's great to be part of it. I absolutely loved the whole occasion and we never tried to play it down."</p>
      <p>"It was fantastic, even a pass they applauded," said Jepson.</p>
      <p>"The crunching tackles they roared, entering into the final third they roared.</p>
      <p>"Every single female player deserves that in the country and I'm really we got to showcase at one of the best grounds in the country.</p>
      <p>"I'll keep knocking on the door to make sure we can play here again because that red carpet is the best carpet you can ever walk out on."</p>
      <p>But the day belonged to Scotland's Lucy Graham whose goal made history.</p>
      <p>"I just focused on trying to get it on target, I was well aware of the time on the clock so I thought it was running down. It wasn't a hit and hope but I was just aiming to get it on target.</p>
      <p>"A massive thank you to the travelling fans home and away, they made it the occasion it was," said the 23-year-old.</p>
      <p>"I think the occasion is massive, it would be really great to have that on a weekly basis - obviously that's not how it works right now but I think it's just great that everybody gets behind it.</p>
      <p>"Whether you call it Everton or Liverpool, you're really starting to see it as one club now. They're playing under the same name so why shouldn't they play under the same roof when they can."</p>
      <p>There are as yet no plans for the return fixture in February to be held at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>But after today, perhaps the powers that be may decide it's just too good an opportunity to let pass.</p>
