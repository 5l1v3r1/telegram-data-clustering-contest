      <h1>Monday's Best Bet: D T Goodie looks good at Parx</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:28:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:28</time> by <a rel="author">Jarrod Horak</a></address>
      <p>Mondayâ€™s 8th race from Parx is an optional claiming event for 3-year-olds and up traveling one mile on the main track (Post Time 3:34 p.m. ET).</p>

      <p>#6 D T GOODIE (3-1) exits back-to-back strong efforts in local dirt sprints, and he earned an above par number in a clear place finish Oct. 28. The versatile gelding has struck three times at this distance.</p>
      <p>#3 Vouch (4-1) is an early-pressing type cutting back in distance. He went to the front and weakened last time, and he will probably end up stalking the pace in this spot.</p>
      <p>#1 Navy Commander (2-1) is 6-for-14 at Parx and 1-for-1 at one mile. He just held on in a local front running score at a mile and seventy yards Oct. 6. Others have speed in this race, and he does own early-pressing versatility.</p>
      <p>#2 His Royal Majesty (6-1) should get pace to chase. The 2-time local winner will almost certainly be last early, and he has a good shot to hit the board.</p>
