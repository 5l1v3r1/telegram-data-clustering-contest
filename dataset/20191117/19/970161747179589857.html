        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> 2019 contestant Adele Roberts is no stranger to reality TV, having appeared in one of the earliest incarnations of the format when she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/when-was-im-a-celebritys-adele-roberts-on-big-brother-and-did-she-win-11089626/">took part in Big Brother 3</a> in 2002, finishing seventh.</b>
      </p>
      <p>While most participants fade into relative obscurity following their brief television experiences, Roberts has persevered to stay in the limelight, earning her a place as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-2019-line-up-suits-up-for-new-series-in-official-photos-11080048/">one of ten contestants</a> in the latest series of the ITV show.</p>
      <p>Originally from Southport, on the Merseyside coast, Roberts was a DJ and personal assistant before entering the house almost 20 years ago, lasting 43 days of the series in an era when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/05/rylan-clark-neal-marks-one-year-since-big-brother-ended-and-hints-it-will-be-back-11044728/">Big Brother</a> reigned supreme and shocked viewers with its largely unprecedented fly-on-the-wall approach.</p>
      <p>Like many evicted contestants, Roberts exited the famous house to a hostile atmosphere, having earned more than 60 percent of the public vote to decide whether she should have been ousted from the complex.</p>

      <p>Her enduring public profile, though, is testimony to the way Roberts, who was 23 at the time, approached life after the at-times brutal experience of being judged by the nation.</p>
      <p>As she prepares to be scrutinised in the more challenging setting of the Australian jungle, let’s take a look at some of her story…</p>
      <h3>Who is Adele Roberts and when was she on Big Brother?</h3>
      <p>Although Roberts’ stint as a housemate on Big Brother ended in 2002, she returned to the show briefly in 2007, taking part in a task alongside fellow Big Brother 3 resident Alex Sibley.</p>
      <p>She is in a minority of participants to have combined their pre-fame careers with a life in the spotlight after being on reality TV, building on her previous taste for broadcasting to become a long-term DJ on BBC Radio 1.</p>

      <p>Her current role behind the microphone is on the Early Breakfast Show, and she also replaces fellow DJs Alice Levine and Clara Amfo.</p>
      <p>Roberts makes no secret of her steely determination, issuing a self-appraisal in which she says: ‘What’s good about me is when I decide to do something, I do it and I do it wholeheartedly.’</p>
      <p>Perhaps the incident she is best remembered for from her time on Big Brother is an explosive argument with housemate <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/21/jade-goody-documentary-viewers-heartbroken-star-given-cancer-diagnosis-air-10610713/">Jade Goody</a>, who tragically died of cervical cancer in 2009.</p>

      <p>Goody was upset by Roberts poking fun at her for not knowing what a verruca was, but Roberts, who is now 40, has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebritys-adele-roberts-feels-guilty-about-explosive-big-brother-row-with-jade-goody-11166450/">admitted to feelings of guilt over the disagreement</a> and offered an apology in the build-up to I’m A Celebrity.</p>

      <h3>Who is Adele Roberts dating and is she married?</h3>
      <p>One of Roberts’ most fervent supporters is her partner Kate Holderness, an actress and vlogger with whom she hosts a food show, Friday Night Fakeaway, making restaurant-style creations with unusually healthy food ingredients.</p>
      <p>Kate is also looking after <a href="https://www.instagram.com/adeleroberts/?hl=en">Adele’s social media accounts</a> while she is in the jungle.</p>

      <p>She has admitted a lack of appetite for sleeping in the open air, which she did after clubbing when she was younger.</p>
      <p>‘Usually when I join a group of people who I don’t know, I move to the back naturally,’ she added.</p>
      <p>‘Then, as I warm up, they can’t shut me up. In the end, they’ll be like, “right, can you start being shy again?”‘</p>
