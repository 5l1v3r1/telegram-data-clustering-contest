      <h1>Delhi water is 100% safe: DJB</h1>
      <h2>Agency criticises study done by Centre</h2>

      <p>The study by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), which stated that Delhi’s water was the most unsafe among 21 State capitals, is not reflective of the ground reality, the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The study had noted that water samples from Delhi failed in 19 of 28 parameters.</p>
      <p>DJB CEO Nikhil Kumar said, “We have tested 1.55 lakh samples since January and they were found to be satisfactory as per both BIS and World Health Organization (WHO) norms.” He said that the WHO considers 5% unsatisfactory results as acceptable, but “the DJB results were much better”.</p>
      <p>“We have not received the [BIS] report and we do not know when and from where the samples have been taken. We assure Delhiites that DJB water is absolutely potable and 100% safe as per BIS and international standards,” said Mr. Kumar.</p>
      <p>“The DJB was not part of this study by the Centre. Compared to the 1.55 lakh samples we have tested since January, the 10 samples is not reflective of the ground reality,” he added.</p>
      <p>A senior DJB official said that sometimes tap water has problems due to issues in connections from the main supply line to the households. “Many times we notice that complaints are due to problems in the connections from the main pipeline. It is the responsibility of the housing society or individual household to rectify it. The DJB is not responsible for problems in connections from the main supply line,” the official added.</p>
      <p>The official further said that people often mix DJB water with supply from borewell, which can also result in lower quality of water.</p>
