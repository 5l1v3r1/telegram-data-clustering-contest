      <h1>Gasly overcome with emotion after sensational P2: "I'm just so happy"</h1>

        <b>After securing his first-ever F1 podium, Toro Rosso driver <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/pierre-gasly">Pierre Gasly</a> was absolutely over the moon, as the Frenchman got a very unlikely second place in what was Toro Rosso's best result since their win in 2008.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gasly has had a very difficult season, struggling to perform at the start for Red Bull and getting dropped to <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/toro-rosso">Toro Rosso</a> after the summer break. However, his performances have been stellar since then, scoring points in nearly every outing for the Italian side.</p>

      <p>On Sunday in Brazil, it all came together for Gasly as he took advantage of both Ferraris taking each other out, as well as <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alex Albon</a> colliding on the penultimate lap.</p>
      <p><i>"This is my first podium in F1 and for sure I will never forget it, it's such a special moment - so emotional,"</i> Gasly told Rubens Barrichello after the race.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"Toro Rosso have given me such a fantastic car since I've come back. It's an amazing day."</i>
      </p>
      <p>The 23-year-old had to fight off Hamilton on the final lap as it turned into a drag race to the finish line, but the Honda-powered Toro Rosso survived the attack from the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> for their second podium of the year.</p>
