      <p>The 17-year-old boy who set himself ablaze on Friday after his father did not allow him to take his motorcycle to school, succumbed to his injuries on Saturday night. “He had100% burns and was on ventilator since the time he was brought in. I spoke to him on Saturday morning, and he said he was fed up of life. Usually in such cases, the patient starts regretting the action after the second or third day, if they survive,” said Dr. Sunil Keswani of National Burns Hospital.</p>
      <p>Shivam Yadav, a Class XI student and a resident of Amardeep society, Kalamboli Sector 1, wanted to take his father’s motorbike to school on Friday morning. On being denied permission, Shivam, on reaching school, went to the washroom on the second floor and set himself ablaze. The staff rushed him to MGM hospital where he told the doctors that he took the step as he was refused to take the bike. The boy’s father, Deepak Yadav, is a police constable who works as driver in the motor department of Nagpada police.</p>
      <p>“On Friday morning Shivam took out petrol from the bike’s tank and took it to school,” sub inspector Archana Chivate from Kalamboli police station said. It is this petrol he doused on himself in school later. He has an elder brother and he being a minor, his father refused him permission to take the bike.</p>
