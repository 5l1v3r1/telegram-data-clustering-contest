      <h1>Jack Riding's dad will 'never get over' loss of teen who saved three lives through organ donation</h1>
      <h2>Ian said his son 'could still be here' if he was given a heart screening before his death</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/olivia-tobin/" target="_blank">Olivia Tobin</a></address>
      <p>The father of a promising 18-year-old footballer who died after collapsing on the pitch has said "you never get over it, you only learn to live with it".</p>
      <p>Ian Riding lost his son, Jack Riding, nearly a year and a half ago after the former <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> youth player went to play football with his friends.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/crosby">Crosby</a> youngster fell to the ground and<a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/young-footballers-heartbreaking-last-words-15997227"> struggled to breathe</a> after living with an underlying heart condition - arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy - which caused his heart to stop suddenly.</p>
      <p>As Jack is posthumously awarded for saving the lives of three people through organ donation, dad Ian, 50, reflects on life without Jack as he fights to get cardiac screening for all young athletes.</p>
      <h3>'We always miss him'</h3>

      <p>Talented Jack was a semi-professsional footballer for Prescot Cables and "loved football", Ian said.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool FC supporter had a "soft spot" for Everton after playing for them, Ian said, and had loved football since he was five.</p>
      <p>Ian said: "He was not one of those people who didn't like certain teams, he would watch anyone play."</p>
      <p>Jack told his dad "see you later" before going to play five-a-side at Goals, in Netherton, last August before his tragic death.</p>
      <p>His friends tried desperately to save Jack when he fell to the floor and gave him CPR before paramedics arrived.</p>
      <p>Jack was resuscitated after over an hour of medics working on him and placed in an induced coma that he never emerged from.</p>

      <p>After losing oxygen to his brain, Ian said Jack suffered brain damage and died shortly after.</p>
      <p>Ian said the time after his son's death has been "devastating".</p>
      <p>He said: "It's devastating really, still. I've not got over it, you learn to live with it, you never get over it.</p>
      <p>"We always miss him, but you learn to live with it."</p>
      <p>Ian added: "He was a quiet lad, but he was a happy lad. I didn't realise how funny he was until we lost him.</p>
      <p>"He was someone who had close friends and was a good friend to them."</p>
      <h3>'I always felt proud of him'</h3>

      <p>After Jack died, Ian said the family were faced with the "surreal" discussion of whether or not he was an organ donor.</p>
      <p>He said: "It was just after we'd given him up and the doctors and nurses asked us if he was an organ donor.</p>
      <p>"We had only just given him up, so it was all so surreal, but they asked us if there had been any arrangements.</p>
      <p>"They were very good and they gave us time, but he had only just turned 18 so he didn't make plans.</p>
      <p>"You think about that kind of thing when you're older."</p>
      <p>A family member who worked at Alder Hey Hospital asked Ian what he thought Jack would have wanted.</p>
      <p>Ian added: "I think he would have wanted it. He was always one for helping people and he was always very kind-hearted."</p>
      <p>Jack was able to donate his kidney, pancreas and liver which were able to help three people. The family have been informed that Jack’s kidneys and pancreas went to older men and his liver went to a teenage girl.</p>

      <p>He also donated various tissues which are saved until a suitable match is found. Because of Jack's footballing background, Ian said he was told some of his tissue and muscle could help other footballers who have been injured.</p>
      <p>Ian said: "That would make him happy, I think. It's a nice thing to think you're helping people through what is a sad thing."</p>
      <p>Jack received the Order of St John Award for Organ donation, run in conjunction with NHS Blood and Transplant, which was given to their families and loved ones on their behalf.</p>
      <p>The private award ceremony was held at The Athenaeum on Church Alley in Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Ian said: "It's all very surreal losing someone and then having them get an award. An award is supposed to be celebrated and is a happy occasion.</p>
      <p>"I always felt proud of him anyway because he had a lot of other awards through football.</p>
      <p>"I was very proud of him [for saving lives] because even though he was gone, he was still getting awards."</p>
      <h3>'My son could still be here'</h3>

      <p>In the time since Jack's sudden death, Ian has set up The Jack Riding Foundation, which aims to raise awareness and provide free heart screenings to all those involved in sport aged 14 to 35.</p>
      <p>It was realised only after Jack's death the condition he was living with was an entirely treatable condition.</p>
      <p>Since his death, Ian and Jack's siblings have been screened.</p>
      <p>He has been working with the charity Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY) to make sure more young people are tested for underlying heart conditions that could prove fatal.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Ian said very little is known about cardiac conditions and he is determined to help people learn more about it and get tested.</p>
      <p>He said: "It's something that is totally preventable, it should be a massive thing that's talked about more."</p>
      <p>Testing, Ian said, was a straight-forward procedure and wasn't an intimidating process, either.</p>
      <p>He believes screening should be at least partly funded by the government, especially for young, active people.</p>
      <p>He said: "It should be rolled out by the government, it shouldn't be down to the likes of us.</p>
      <p>"If it was funded by the government, then the likes of Jack would still be here. There's thousands of people who would still be here and not going through this.</p>
      <p>"My son could still be here."</p>
