        <b>Lewis Hamilton has received a five-second time penalty for causing a collision with Alexander Albon on the penultimate lap of the Brazilian Grand Prix, meaning the Brit will drop seventh and Carlos Sainz gets his first-ever podium in F1.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton, who dropped to fourth place under the second Safety Car as he opted to pit for new tyres, tried to dive down the inside of Albon to get back into the podium positions. </p>
      <p>However, there was no real space for him to get into as the two collided, with Albon spinning around and losing his potential first podium for Red Bull. The Thai driver eventually finished 14th.</p>
      <p>The five-second penalty means Hamilton drops to seventh place, bumping Sainz into P3, Kimi Raikkonen to fourth, Antonio Giovinazzi fifth and Daniel Ricciardo sixth. It's not the way Sainz would've wanted to get his first podium, but the Spaniard will be happy to take P3 in his fifth year of F1.</p>
