      <p>CAMDEN, N.J. — A New Jersey man faces allegations he conspired to carry out spray paint vandalism attacks two months ago against synagogues in Michigan and Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>The Philadelphia Inquirer reported 18-year-old Richard Tobin allegedly recruited people on a neo-Nazi social network.</p>
      <p>Court records indicate Tobin told investigators he considered suicide attacks and once sat with a machete in the parking lot of a New Jersey mall, considering an attack on black shoppers.</p>
      <p>An email message for his public defender wasn’t returned.</p>
      <p>The paper says the synagogues that were vandalized with swastikas and other images on Sept. 21-22 were in Hancock, Michigan, and Racine, Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>A magistrate judge ordered Tobin to remain incarcerated Friday, pending a mental health evaluation.</p>
      <p>The paper says authorities declined to discuss the details of their investigation.</p>
