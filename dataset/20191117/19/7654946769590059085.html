      <p>The man who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/01/14/chilling-details-of-jayme-closs-kidnapping-revealed/">kidnapped Wisconsin teenager Jayme Closs after killing her parents</a> is having trouble making friends behind bars.</p>
      <p>Jake Patterson, 22, was caught on jailhouse surveillance video getting into a nasty brawl with another inmate at the New Mexico prison where he’s serving a life sentence, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/jayme-closs-kidnapper-jake-patterson-fight-new-mexico">Fox News reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The August cell-block beef started after some inmates learned that Patterson’s case involved the 14-year-old Closs, prompting them to tell him to get out of their prison pod, Fox said.</p>
      <p>Patterson begins talking to one of them, and soon, the pair are wailing away on each other, the video shows.</p>
      <p>The two hit the ground after a correction officer arrives and fires an orange beanbag from a shotgun that strikes a railing near them and ends the brawl.</p>
      <p>Patterson was sentenced to life after he pleaded guilty in May to kidnapping Closs in October 2018. Before kidnapping the teen, he killed her parents, James and Denise Closs, inside their Wisconsin home.</p>
      <p>The girl was held for 88 days under Patterson’s bed in a cabin about an hour from the home before the teen escaped and was able to alert authorities. <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/14/jayme-closs-feels-stronger-every-day-a-year-after-her-kidnapping/">She has been recovering from the trauma</a>.</p>
      <p>Patterson was transferred to the New Mexico prison in July amid security concerns at the Wisconsin prison where he began his sentence — and where he got into a fight with another inmate in June.</p>
