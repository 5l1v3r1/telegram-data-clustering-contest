        <b>Tommy Fleetwood sparkled in Sun City with a magnificent final round and held his nerve in a play-off to claim a fifth European Tour title</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tommy Fleetwood came out on top in a play-off with Marcus Kinhult to win the Nedbank Golf Challenge after surging up the leaderboard with a magnificent closing seven-under 65.</p>
      <p>Fleetwood started his final round six shots behind adrift of leader Zander Lombard in Sun City and finished it with a first title since January 2018 along with a cheque for USD 2,500,000.</p>
      <p>The European Ryder Cup star hit the turn in 31 and a second successive eagle three at the 10th took him to the summit at the Gary Player Country Club.</p>
      <p>Fleetwood’s momentum was halted by back-to-back bogeys, but a third eagle at 14 following a superb approach shot to within 10 feet of the pin put him back into a share of the lead with Kinhult.</p>
      <p>A fourth birdie of the day at 15 gave the Englishman a two-shot advantage, but he gave that stroke straight back at the next hole and pars at 17 and 18 ensured he set the clubhouse target at 12 under.</p>
      <p>Kinhult made just the one gain on the back nine after going out in 33 – having birdied the first three holes – and a four-under 68 was enough to force a play-off.</p>
      <p>It was not to be for the Swede, though, as a poor tee shot resulted in a bogey and Fleetwood got up and down to save par, claiming his second Rolex Series title and the biggest European Tour cash prize in history.</p>

      <p>Fleetwood also moves up to second in the Race to Dubai rankings, with leader Bernd Wiesberger unable to wrap the title up with a week to spare after finishing in a share of third place with Thomas Detry and Jason Scrivener.</p>
      <p>The battle to be crowned European number one will be settled at what promises to be a thrilling season-ending DP World Tour Championship in Dubai next weekend.</p>
      <p>Defending champion Lee Westwood took a share of sixth place with Louis Oosthuizen, while Lombard saw a maiden European Tour title slips through his fingers as he carded a five-over 77 to finish four off the pace home soil.</p>
