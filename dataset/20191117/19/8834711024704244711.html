      <h1>PSL Smashes Billion-Rand Revenue Mark</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:55:38+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/sporteditor/" target="_blank">SW Editor</a></address>
      <p>The South African Premier Soccer League (PSL), boosted by a lucrative TV deal, posted record revenue of more than one billion rand last season.</p>
      <p>A statement said TV rights and sponsorships from banks, telecommunication and engineering companies were responsible for the 1,005 billion ($68 million/62 mn euros) bonanza.</p>
      <p>“The results are due to the renewal of our broadcast deals because they contribute a high percentage of income,” PSL chairman Irvin Khoza confirmed Sunday.</p>
      <p>“We have reached the one billion rand mark and that augurs well for the clubs as the monthly grants to them will increase next season.”</p>
      <p>The PSL runs a 30-round league, which the SuperSport channel screens throughout Africa, and the first prize increased 50 percent to 15 million rand for the 2019/2020 season.</p>
      <p>SuperSport paid more than two billion rand this year for a five-year renewal of the deal to screen the South African Premiership and three knockout competitions.</p>
      <p>The Johannesburg-based pay-to-view channel has a reported seven million subscribers in South Africa, and millions more spread across the rest of Africa.</p>
      <p>SuperSport sublet matches to the cash-strapped South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), which pays 72 million rand per season.</p>
      <p>There are also three knockout competitions, including a League Cup and an FA Cup, for the 16 top-flight clubs to contest.</p>
      <p>– Winner-takes-all –</p>
      <p>The other one, the MTN8 for the top eight finishers in the previous league, gives an eight million rand winner-takes-all prize for playing just four games.</p>
      <p>Although some leagues, notably those in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, produce a more internationally successful brand of football, South African clubs top the financial table.</p>
      <p>Apart from challenging for four first prizes annually, totalling 34 million rand, each club receives a monthly grant of 2.5 million rand.</p>
      <p>Some sides, like defending champions and 2016 CAF Champions League winners Mamelodi Sundowns, have the added advantage of rich South African owners.</p>
      <p>The funding of dollar billionaire Patrice Motsepe allows Sundowns to buy stars not only from Africa but also South America, with two Uruguayans, a Brazilian and a Venezuelan on their books.</p>
      <p>One challenge for the PSL is attracting more spectators to fixtures not featuring the big crowd-pullers, Soweto sides Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates and Pretoria-based Sundowns.</p>
      <p>While the ‘big three’ can draw crowds of up to 90,000, even for a friendly match, games between less popular sides struggle to lure 5,000.</p>
