      <h1>Gareth Southgate praises two England players offering insight into Euro 2020 selection</h1>
      <h2>England made it two wins from two in the international break to complete the last of their qualification fixtures, with two players particularly impressing their manager</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:41:08+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:41</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Southgate reserved special praise for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/alex-oxlade-chamberlain">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> and Harry Winks after England concluded their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign in Kosovo.</p>
      <p>The Three Lions won their final Group A match in comfortable fashion, having already qualified after thrashing Montenegro on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Southgate deployed Winks in a more advanced role in the midfield three against Kosovo, and he combined with his midfield colleague for the opener.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain spotted <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/harry-winks">Winks's</a> run and picked him out, as the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> star's first touch took him into the box before he slotted the ball in the corner.</p>
      <p>When asked what positives he had taken from England's two qualifiers against Kosovo and Montenegro, Southgate said: "I think the performances of those two players.</p>

      <p>"For Alex at his stage of playing, the second start was physically difficult, but he's been a real plus with the power of his running, and the attacking threat he gives us from that area.</p>
      <p>"Harry Winks I thought was excellent both games. Really took the ball well at moments tonight where we needed calming.</p>
      <p>"His ability to receive the ball under pressure and keep the calmness in possession really settled the team."</p>

      <p>England ran out 4-0 winners over Kosovo in a scoreline which perhaps flattered Southgate's men.</p>
      <p>Winks's first half opener had put them in command, but they didn't add their second until almost 10 minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane finished off a deflected Raheem Sterling cross to double their advantage, before Marcus Rashford and Mason Mount both scored late on.</p>
      <p>Despite England's ruthlessness going forward, they had been tested several times on the counter attack, and it was another far from convincing defensive display.</p>

      <p>Questioned on whether he had any concerns after their last competitive fixture before next summer's tournament, Southgate added: "I think the set plays in particular are something we need to go away and look at.</p>
      <p>"There have been too many people free in the box and chances given away. We're always looking to improve, we know there's a bit of work to do.</p>
      <p>"But we can't fault the players through this qualifying campaign, they've been absolutely ruthless."</p>
