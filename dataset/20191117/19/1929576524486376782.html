      <p>WINNIPEG – The Winnipeg teen who – during her fight with terminal cancer – challenged thousands of Canadians everywhere to vote, has died.</p>
      <p>The family of 18-year-old Maddison Yetman announced on Twitter Sunday morning that Yetman had died after a battle with cancer.</p>
      <p>The University of Winnipeg student grabbed the attention of the country when – four days after being diagnosed with terminal cancer – she posted a video urging Canadians to vote. Sitting in her hospital bed, Yetman said she was able to cast her first-ever vote in the 43rd federal election.</p>
      <p>She challenged Canadians asking them “what’s your excuse?”</p>
