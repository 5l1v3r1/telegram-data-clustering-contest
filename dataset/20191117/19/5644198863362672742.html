      <p>JOHANNESBURG: Cape Town City midfielder Mpho Makola has been banned for six months after shoving a referee - an offence for which he was only yellow carded.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old former international used both hands to push referee Abongile Tom last month after opponents Kaizer Chiefs were awarded a penalty during a League Cup match.</p>

      <p>Although a red-card offence, Tom only cautioned out-of-control Makola, who had to be dragged away from the match official by teammates.</p>
      <p>The Makola ban has shocked many South African football followers used to offenders receiving light sentences for serious acts of ill discipline.</p>
      <p>Match bans and fines are often conditionally reduced, leading to criticism that the lenient approach encourages bad behaviour.</p>
      <p>When a top-flight footballer was handed a 12-month sentence for spitting at a referee, it was slashed to six matches and a suspended 100,000 rand (US$6,800) fine on appeal.</p>
      <p>After another spitting incident, this time between players, a 10-match ban was cut to six after the offender appealed, and no fine was imposed.</p>
      <p>With the Makola ban effective from Nov 15, he will miss the rest of the 2019/2020 season unless Cape Town reach the FA Cup final, scheduled for May 23.</p>
