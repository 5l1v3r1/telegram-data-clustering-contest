      <p>Officers were called to the premises at Strood Retail Park in Kent at 11.30pm on Saturday following reports of anti-social behaviour by young people travelling to the site.</p>

      <p>A Kent Police spokesman said: “It was established that a suspected unlicensed music event was being held inside a disused warehouse with a significant number of people in attendance.</p>
      <p>“Officers remained at the location to prevent any potential breach of the peace, ensure public safety and identify if any criminal offences had been committed.”</p>
      <p>A video posted on social media shows a large number of people dancing inside the disused store, which had been set up with lighting systems for the event.</p>
      <p>A number of police are also shown waiting outside the premises.</p>

      <p>A voice is heard on the video saying: “We’ve finished work, gone to McDonald’s in Strood and hear about this illegal rave at Carpetright – this is crazy.”</p>
      <p>The force spokesman said that a 39-year-old man from Ashford was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to commit a public order offence and supplying a psychoactive substance (nitrous oxide).</p>
      <p>He added: “Enquiries are ongoing.”</p>
