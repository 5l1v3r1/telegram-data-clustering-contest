      <p>There were big expectations from <i>War</i>, but the movie surpassed all of it by going to become the highest-grosser of this year. The movie, in its glorious run, has also entered the Rs 300-crore club. Apart from Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff’s action moves, physique and looks becoming a talking point, Taapsee Pannu too had a role to play in it. No, the actor did not feature in a blink-and-you-miss-it role in the movie that could not be spotted by anyone. Unlike other celebrities who catch these films at the screenings, Taapsee Pannu watched the movie by buying its ticket. The actor was happy to consider it as her contribution to the success of the movie. </p>
