      <h1>Radio Personality Starts Petition to Ban Pro Sports in Denver Due To Cheating</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:15:32+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Denver, Colorado has long held its “Mile High City” moniker due to the city’s positioning east of the Rocky Mountains. Visiting sports teams already know what to expect and prepare accordingly for its unique elevation.</p>
      <p>The challenge is part of the game for some, but damn near impossible for others and they can’t perform well at all.</p>
      <p>Spike Eskin, a radio program director at 94WIP Sports Radio in Philadelphia, has a serious gripe with Denver, so he took to Twitter to protest the “unfair and unreasonable” advantages gained by Denver’s sports teams.</p>

      <p>He followed that up with another tweet that called for a ban of Denver.</p>
      <p>“imagine at a sports arena if they pressurized it so the away team would have trouble breathing? it would be disallowed immediately. this is basically what happens in Denver. #BanDenver”</p>
      <p>The Tweet came after a November 8th meeting between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Denver Nuggets, a matchup where the 76ers lost 100-97.</p>

      <p>On Friday, the radio personality jumped back on Twitter and started a campaign on Change.org to ban professional sports from Denver.</p>

      <p>It reads as:</p>
      <blockquote>“The elevation in cities like Denver creates an unfair advantage for the home team. As has been public knowledge for a long time, athletes who travel to Denver who do not have the proper amount of time for their bodies to adjust, have trouble breathing when performing. A person from a cold weather climate participating in hot weather, that’s tough. A person from sea level competing in Denver, that’s cheating.<br/><br/>We propose that all professional sports move teams out of Denver, so we can have fair outcomes for the sports we all care so much about.”</blockquote>
      <p>Unfortunately for him, The Broncos recently agreed to a 21-year stadium naming rights deal through 2039, while the Rockies signed a new 30-year, $200 million lease back in 2017.</p>
      <p>NBA’s Denver Nuggets and NHL’s Colorado Avalanche also reached an agreement with the City and County of Denver to keep the teams in town until at least 2040.</p>
      <p>Denver sports isn’t going anywhere.</p>
