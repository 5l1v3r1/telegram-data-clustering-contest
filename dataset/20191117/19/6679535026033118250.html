      <p>The Air quality in the Capital on Sunday settled in the ‘poor’ category primarily due to an increase in wind speed. Delhi’s AQI on Sunday was 215 (poor); it was 357 (very poor) on Saturday, as per CPCB data.</p>
      <p>The air quality is likely to improve marginally on Monday but may deteriorate on Tuesday, said forecasting agency SAFAR.</p>
      <p>Pointing out that there is a “strong correlation” between stubble burning and pollution in north India, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said: “The stubble burning has stopped and with it, the air quality in Delhi has improved.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, BJP MP Vijay Goel and members from the party’s Delhi unit held a protest at Jantar Mantar on Sunday accusing the AAP government of failing to curb pollution in the Capital.</p>
