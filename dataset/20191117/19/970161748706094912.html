        <b>Roy Keane believes <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/marcus-rashford/">Marcus Rashford</a> is back to his best as his superb run of goal-scoring form continued in England’s 4-0 win over Kosovo.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> forward produced a fantastic finish to net England’s third goal on Sunday night, having also scored in the 7-0 win over Montenegro on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has now scored in each of his last four games for club and country, and nine in his last 10 matches.</p>
      <p>The former Red Devils captain was full of praise for the forward after his cool finish in Pristina for the Three Lions.</p>
      <p>‘Brilliant, brilliant goal. What a finish,’ Keane said on ITV. ‘He is back to his best. Lovely play, nice and simple.</p>

      <p>‘Does it matter about the opposition? Of course it does, because they’re getting opportunities, but that was the goal of the night, lovely finish. Pure quality.’</p>
      <p>There is serious competition for places in the England attack, with Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling seemingly guaranteed starters, but the third of the three places up front up for grabs.</p>
      <p>Jadon Sancho is fighting for that position, as is Callum Hudson-Odoi, who started against Kosovo, but Keane says it is Rashford who should get the nod.</p>
      <p>‘The attacking three players you’d have at the minute are Sterling, Kane and Rashford, the three of them are outstanding players, cause you all sorts of headaches,’ said the Irishman.</p>
      <p>England’s latest resounding win took them to 37 goals scored in the qualification process, which is more than the country has ever managed before.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane also netted his 12th international goal of 2019, which equals the record for England goals in a calendar year, set by George Hilsdon in 1908 and Dixie Dean in 1927.</p>
