      <p>BBC’s latest – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/05/dark-materials-watched-british-show-five-years-11047026/">and massively popular</a> – fantasy series <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/his-dark-materials/">His Dark Materials</a>has gripped viewers across the country since it premiered earlier this month.</p>
      <p>From nostalgia over the original Phillip Pullman books to the captivating storylines, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/02/dark-materials-come-cast-wrote-trilogy-11030034/">stellar cast</a> and impressive visuals, there’s a lot to drink in.</p>
      <p>But one question which keeps niggling us is: where is it supposed to be set, and in what year?</p>
      <h3>What year is His Dark Materials set?</h3>
      <p>While the series looks completely other-worldly, we can look at the novels to get a sense of when the action is supposed to take place.</p>
      <p>The books were written in the 1990s and were set in an alternate version of the present day.</p>

      <p>Because the books were set contemporary to when they were written, the series has followed suit and is set contemporary to when it was filmed – AKA 2019.</p>

      <p>Producer Jane Tranter spoke about their decision to bring the setting forward, introducing smartphones and computer hackers into the mix.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/11/his-dark-materials-episode-2-lord-boreal-subtle-knife/">Entertainment Weekly</a>: ‘We wanted to make it work for 2019 and Philip was fine on that.</p>
      <p>‘We then were just mindful of how technology makes a difference… The rule of The Magisterium in Lyra’s world, the whole point of their rule is to discourage learning and information and exploration.’</p>
      <h3>Where is His Dark Materials filmed?</h3>
      <p>Given the fantastical and ethereal feel of the show, it’s little surprise that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/03/dark-materials-behind-scenes-magic-created-daemons-puppets-lifelike-cgi-11035324/">CGI plays a big role</a>.</p>
      <p>Many scenes were shot with green screens at Wolf Studios in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>Cast member Lin-Manuel Miranda also tweeted that some filming had taken place in Brecon Beacons.</p>

      <p>The National Park in South Wales is home to lush lakes and sprawling hills and greenery.</p>
      <p>It seems Lin-Manuel is a fan too, as he tweeted: ‘Coming home from filming in the Brecon Beacons all day, no cell service and miles of mountains &amp; sky. I’m a miss [Wales] so much y’all.’</p>

      <p>Exterior shots for the fictional college of Jordan were filmed at Oxford University, as well as New College Lane and the city’s iconic Bridge of Sighs.</p>
      <p>Other filming took place at the River Severn in Gloucester and Crickhowell, South Wales, where the crew built a tin-roofed village specifically for the show.</p>
