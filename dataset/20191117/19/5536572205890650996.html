      <p>You know an injury is too bad if CBS decides not to show a replay of it.</p>
      <p>During the Broncos-Vikings game on Sunday, FB Andy Janovich caught a pass, got tackled, but his arm seemed to snap in two as he tried to brace for the fall.</p>
      <p>He got up instantly and grabbed for that arm. He would eventually get carted off to the locker room.</p>
