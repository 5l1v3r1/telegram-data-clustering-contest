      <p>VANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) – In <i>Vancouver After Dark:  The Wild History of a City’s Nightlife</i>, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAaronChapman">Aaron Chapman</a> goes back to the very beginning.  </p>
      <p>“Vancouver itself is, and always has been, very well-placed,” he points out, as Vancouver was, and still is, a city where many acts like to start their tours.</p>
      <p>“This was sort of known as ‘tune-up city’ going back to like when the Marx Brothers used to bring a live show to the Orpheum Theatre,” he explains.  </p>
      <p>“In particular, in the 1960s, places like the Cave and Isy’s Supper Club, Oil Can Harry’s, these were all places where some of the nightclub acts of the day would do their shows.”</p>
      <p><i>Vancouver After Dark</i> is Chapman’s fourth book. </p>

      <p>“Definitely the book has more in common with the books on The Penthouse and The Commodore that I’ve done. Those places are still standing, of course, but there’s a litany of clubs over the years that are gone and everybody has a favourite sort of nightspot that they used to go to that isn’t around anymore.”</p>
      <p>For some, that may be places like Luvafair or Richard’s On Richards.  </p>

      <p>However, Chapman is quick to dismiss any talk of Vancouver ever having been a “no fun city” or of the golden age of the city’s club scene truly being over.</p>
      <p>“Everybody has their own concept of what the glory days were and the funny thing is, the glory days move with every generation,” he argues.  </p>
      <p>“Now, there have been people who have wanted to shut down the party, but, at the same time, there were always a sort of a smarter, more clever class of people that managed to get around that.”</p>
      <p>These days, while high land values make club space more scarce and the players more corporate, Chapman remains hopeful.  </p>
      <p>“Will new clubs open?  I’m sure they will. Do you have to be smarter than ever to run that business?  You sure do.”</p>
