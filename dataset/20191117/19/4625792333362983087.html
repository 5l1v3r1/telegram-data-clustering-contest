      <h1>Democrat against impeachment calls out party for 'fracturing the nation' with investigation</h1>

      <p>Democratic New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew attacked his own party for the current impeachment investigation going on in the House of Representatives, during an interview on <i>Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo</i>.</p>
      <p>Van Drew, who was one of two Democrats to vote against the impeachment proceedings last month, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-think-its-going-to-fail-van-drew-and-peterson-break-with-democrats-on-impeachment-measure">remained critical of party leadership's decisions</a> on the investigation into President Trump's discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
      <p>"I just think we'll keep going down this road, keep spending more time. Many of us came to Congress because we really wanted to accomplish goals, really work on issues such as healthcare, work on issues dealing with prescription drugs, election security, the debt, the deficit â€” the list goes on," Van Drew explained.</p>
      <p>He went on to point out that people should "understand the importance" of impeachment and added that no president has been impeached and convicted in the Senate.</p>
      <p>"We're going to have an election next year, let's have the election, let's fight through the election, let's do what Republicans and Democrats and whomever else does, but this is going to get us nowhere. We've spent millions of dollars, in my opinion, tons of money, tons of time, tons of hurt, fracturing the nation apart. I haven't seen this to be a good thing," Van Drew concluded.</p>
      <p>The House Intelligence Committee began public hearings last week with the testimonies of <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/george-kent-must-not-read-the-new-york-times-which-broke-the-story-about-ukraines-2016-election-interference">George Kent</a>, the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs; <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/we-all-can-get-it-wrong-mike-pompeo-suggests-william-taylor-misunderstood-ukraine-controversy">William Taylor</a>, the top diplomat in Ukraine; and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/yovanovitch-says-obama-administration-prepped-her-to-answer-questions-about-hunter-biden-during-confirmation">Marie Yovanovitch</a>, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.</p>
