      <p>An Arizona man has been nabbed in a cold-case investigation four decades after the body of a murdered 21-year-old woman was discovered in Nevada, officials said.</p>
      <p>Charles Gary Sullivan, 73, was extradited Friday to Nevada from Arizona, where he was arrested in the 1979 slaying of Julia Howard, according to the Nevada Attorney General’s Office.</p>
      <p>The break in the cold case came after authorities used DNA technology with the evidence, officials said.</p>
      <p>Woodward was last seen alive in February 1979 at a San Francisco airport before heading to Nevada to look or job opportunities, authorities said.</p>
      <p>She was discovered dead from blunt force trauma the next month in a shallow grave 15 miles north of Reno, <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/washoe-county-makes-arrest-in-1979-murder-1894167/">the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Woodward’s body was about a mile from another homicide victim, Jeannie Smith, whose remains were discovered buried in November 1979, the outlet reported. She also died from blunt force trauma and her case remains unsolved.</p>
      <p>However, Sullivan hasn’t been charged in Smith’s death and police haven’t linked the two cases, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.</p>
      <p>Authorities are expected to release more information about Woodward’s slaying after Sullivan’s arraignment, which is set for Tuesday in Washoe District Court, the outlet reported.</p>
