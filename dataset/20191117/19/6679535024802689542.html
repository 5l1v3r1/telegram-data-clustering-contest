      <p>JNU students on Sunday announced that as part of their protest against the hike in hostel fee, they will organise a “long march” from the university to Parliament on the first day of its winter session on Monday.</p>
      <p>The JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) said that the march was to “save public education” and they would like to ask Parliamentarians to ensure that “education remains a right and not a privilege”.</p>
      <p>The JNUSU appealed to students from other universities to lend their support to the protest and join them on their march.</p>
      <p>“JNU is on the brink of destruction and if the university administration has its way, fees will rise by over 1,100%...,<b> </b>As per JNU’s own data, over 40% of students will have to dropout and possibly leave their education,” said the students’ union.</p>
