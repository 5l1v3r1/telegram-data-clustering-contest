      <p>The victim managed to leave the place and narrated her ordeal to policemen standing nearby.</p>
      <p>“While she was talking to the policemen, the accused was standing nearby. On the basis of her complaint, police caught the accused and took him to the police station,” the officer added. The police registered a case under Section 376 (rape) of the IPC.</p>
