      <p>Nupur Sanon has recently revealed that her elder sister Kriti Sanon can often be like a mother to her, due to her protective nature, especially when overlooking Nupur’s entry into the Bollywood scene which can often be fraught with piercing criticism from the public.</p>
      <p>Kriti has made it her duty to condition Nupur to be more resilient to the media, by building her confidence with compliments, but also honestly pointing out Nupur’s areas of improvement. Commenting on Kriti’s protective attitude, Nupur said in a media interaction, “Whenever Kriti compliments me about something, she also gives me some kind of negative feedback, because she is very protective and she is also like my chhoti mummy”.</p>
      <p>Nupur also touched on Kriti’s response after the release of her music video titled ‘Filhall’, stating, “I didn’t contact her after the release of my video. I thought she would contact me after watching it because she has been away shooting in Mandawa. So, she sent me a long text message and there was nothing negative in it. She was like ‘I loved the song and I am so proud of you’. I am really happy after reading her message”.</p>
