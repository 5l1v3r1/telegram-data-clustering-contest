      <p>"God has been calling me for a long time," West said after Sunday's service at Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church, <a href="https://abc13.com/society/god-has-been-calling-me-kanye-west-speaks-at-lakewood/5703263/?ex_cid=SND_KTRK_FB&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=snd">KTRK</a> reported. "The devil has been distracting me for a long time."</p>

      <p>West sat down with Osteen after Sunday's 11 a.m. service to talk about his faith, as his wife, Kim Kardashian, watched from the audience, <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/entertainment/live-blog-kanye-wests-conversation-with-joel-osteen-at-lakewood-church">KRPC</a> reported.</p>
      <p>"All the arrogance and cockiness y'all have seen me use before God, now I'm using it for him," West told the congregation. "It's like the devil stole all the good producers, all the good musicians, all the good artists, all the good designers, all the good business people and now the shift is going to change.</p>
      <p>"Jesus has won the victory because now the greatest artist that ever existed is working for him."</p>

      <p>West turned more humble moments later when he noted, "The only superstar is Jesus."</p>
      <p>West, who released his ninth album, "Jesus is King," last month, is scheduled to appear with his choir during Lakewood's 7 p.m. ceremony, <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/entertainment/live-blog-kanye-wests-conversation-with-joel-osteen-at-lakewood-church">KPRC</a> reported.</p>
