      <h1>'Cannot deny it' - Aston Villa flop wins first cap after Champions League revival</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa latest | Pierluigi Gollini was a Roberto Di Matteo signing in 2016 - but he was overtaken at Villa Park by Sam Johnstone later in the 2016-17 season</h2>

      <p>Former Aston Villa goalkeeper Pierluigi Gollini has made his senior international debut for Italy.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old - who was signed at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> by Roberto Di Matteo in 2016 - made a late substitute appearance in his country's 3-0 win over Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina in European Championship qualifying, replacing AC Milan stopper Gianluigi Donnarumma.</p>
      <p>The Italians had already booked their place at next summer's finals.</p>
      <p>“It was really a fantastic feeling and I cannot deny it reminded me of my Serie A debut,” Gollini told Rai Sport in Zenica.</p>
      <p>“I am so happy, even to be there only for a few minutes, for this debut.”</p>

      <p>Gollini made 20 Championship appearances for Villa, all before Christmas of the 2016-17 campaign.</p>
      <p>He then headed out on loan to Atalanta later that season after Sam Johnstone's first loan arrival at Villa Park, and Gollini returned to the Italian club for a season-long loan in 2017-18.</p>
      <p>He sealed a permanent move in July 2018.</p>
