      <p>“The guns on the table show you why gun violence is not a local but a national problem,” U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said, according to <a href="https://boston.cbslocal.com/2019/11/15/32-charged-gun-drug-sweep-greater-lawrence-area/">CBS 4</a> Boston.</p>
      <p>“These guns did not originate in Massachusetts,” he said. “Many, if not most of them, were purchased in other states and eventually lost or stolen after which they wound up on the streets.”</p>

      <p>The Trinitarios gang has spread to New England from New York, according to the station.</p>
      <p>The gang, known for its ruthlessness according to members of the New York Police Department, came to national attention after video recorded members of the gang killing 15-year-old boy Lesandro “Junior” Guzman-Feliz last year in the Bronx. The gang mistook the boy for a rival gang member.</p>
      <p>“Operation Emerald Crush” also netted heroin, fentanyl and cocaine, NBC 10 reported.</p>
