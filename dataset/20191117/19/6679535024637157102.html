      <h2>Writ petition challenging project across Chilavannoor lake pending before High Court</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:15:07+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The Sarovaram walkway-and-cycle-track project of the Kochi Corporation continues to be on the wrong track as the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA) has picked holes in its application seeking Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance.</p>
      <p>The KCZMA meeting on Saturday deferred a decision on the clearance as a writ petition challenging the project was pending before the Kerala High Court.</p>
      <p>The Authority decided to wait for the outcome of the writ petition to decide on the application.</p>
      <p>When the project was considered as special agenda on Saturday, it was pointed out that the project proponent, Kochi Corporation, did not submit the no-objection certificates from the Kerala State Pollution Control Board, the consent letter from the Ground Water Board and the Kerala State Electricity Board along with the application. Moreover, the civic authorities failed to submit the risk assessment plan to the KCZMA.</p>
      <p>The civic authorities had to stop work on the project, which began without obtaining the prior permission of the KCZMA, after public protests. Various political parties and organisations too came out against the project. As the public protest mounted and complaints were raised against the illegal construction, the Revenue officials and the KCZMA issued a stop memo.</p>
      <h3>Vulnerable area</h3>
      <p>The walkway project was meant to connect “Sahodaran Ayyappan Road and Subash Chandra Bose Road for a length of 540 metres”. It was proposed that the walkway would stretch from Elamkulam station of Kochi metro to Chettichira on Subash Chandra Bose Road with a width of 4 metres and elevated 1.5 metres above the High Tide Line. The proposed project site is located along the Chilavannoor lake. The Chilavannoor lake, which is the part of Vembanad lake, extends from Chettichira bridge on Subash Chandra Bose Road in Kochi Corporation to Irrigation Bund Road in Maradu municipality. The Vembanad is a designated Critically Vulnerable Coastal Area, according to project documents.</p>
      <p>The site of the ₹9.3-crore project “is within the CRZ of Chilavannoor lake, the part of tidal influenced Vembanad backwaters, a designated Critically Vulnerable Coastal Area. The project site is covered in Map No KL-32 of the Coastal Zone Management Plan of Kerala prepared as per the CRZ Notification 2011,” according to the documents.</p>
