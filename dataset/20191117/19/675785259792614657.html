      <h1>Sterling puts Gomez incident behind him to return to starring role for England</h1>
      <h2>The Manchester City man has served his punishment for 'canteen-gate' but returned with two assists and a performance that showed he won't be affected by the altercation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:14:52+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:14</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Dunn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>It was a night when a few England players did not come up to scratch.</p>
      <p>Raheem Sterling was not one of them.</p>
      <p>It might be a little while before the mark on the face of Joe Gomez fades to nothing but time has quickly healed any scars self-inflicted by Sterling.</p>
      <p>While Gomez was back home, resting the knee injury that will probably not keep him off the Melwood training field this week and, as Gareth Southgate suggested, ‘clearing his head’, Sterling was strutting as though canteen-gate had never happened.</p>
      <p>Which is exactly what Southgate, Harry Kane and the rest of the England leadership group - which includes Sterling - had demanded.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>For Sterling, the national anthem was sung with a little more gusto, the commitment just a little higher than some of his team-mates on as treacherous surface.</p>
      <p>There were no goals - a very decent first half save from Arijanet Muric saw to that - but there was one deflected assist for Kane’s strike and another more accomplished one for Marcus Rashford’s hit.</p>
      <p>This was Sterling wanting to show just how much he values his time in an England jersey.</p>
      <p>Let’s get one thing straight. As the player himself has stressed, his one-game ‘suspension’ - whether you agree with Southgate’s action or not - was a punishment brought about by Sterling’s own actions.</p>
      <p>The absent Gomez was the victim, the absent Jordan Henderson the peace broker, the present Sterling the villain.</p>
      <p>There are those, including myself, who believe Southgate could have handled it differently.</p>
      <p>But as accounts of the incident at St George’s Park last Monday continue to leak out, it is now patently clear there was only one aggressor.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>According to the mantra spun by manager and players, it is over and done with now. Forgotten.</p>
      <p>Whether that turns out to be the case in the mind of Gomez - especially when you factor in the Wembley jeers - remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>But it will be gone from Sterling’s mind. He has rock-solid form for moving on from controversy pretty well.</p>
      <p>And as brutally practical as it sounds, he is more fundamental to England’s fortunes than Gomez.</p>
      <p>(Not that Southgate would ever dish out preferential treatment.)</p>
      <p>His individual performance here was no more memorable than a team performance seriously flattered by the late Kosovan capitulation.</p>
      <p>But over on the opposite side of the pitch, Callum Hudson-Odoi should have been taking note.</p>
      <p>Sterling never stops showing for the ball, is never afraid to take it under pressure, is always varying his runs, is always looking for a combination with the central figure of Kane.</p>

        <figcaption>Sterling's performance was only lacking a goal (Image: Action Images via Reuters)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He puts in the defensive work, closes down quickly, puts in the hard yards.</p>
      <p>Right now, Southgate perms three from four for his preferred attacking trio.</p>
      <p>Well, actually, he selects either Jadon Sancho or Rashford to make up the three alongside Kane and Sterling.</p>
      <p>And on this evidence, it is not going to be three from five any time soon.</p>
      <p>Hudson-Odoi, that man trying to widen Southgate’s options even further, said ahead of the match how Sterling was an idol and how he wanted to learn from him.</p>
      <p>That is a good idea and this was a stage in that process.</p>
      <p>And hopefully, Hudson-Odoi watched from the bench as Sterling switched to the middle, surged forward and rolled a pass to Rashford that was converted without a break of the stride.</p>
      <p>A sweet assist and a sweet finish.</p>

      <p>And an evening when the scoreline was more emphatic than the performance ended with Mason Mount enjoying the sort of memorable scoring moment experienced by Harry Winks in the first half.</p>
      <p>The England players congregated in a congratulatory huddle, Sterling at its centre.</p>
      <p>And only Kane beat Sterling to the England fans when referee Pawel Gil called a halt to proceedings.</p>
      <p>Sterling applauded, the fans applauded. Not a jeer to be heard.</p>
      <p>It was as though nothing had happened.</p>
      <p>Sterling service, back to normal.</p>
