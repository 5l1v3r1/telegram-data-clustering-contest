      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> and co, sorry, ko, have their fair share of drama pretty much 24/7 – be it <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/kim-kardashian-cuts-off-kourtney-peoples-choice-awards-2019-amid-feud-rumours-really-awkward-11077135/">alleged family feuds</a> or <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/kanye-west-wants-change-name-christian-genius-billionaire-kanye-west-not-11064598/">husbands wanting to change their names</a> to, er, Christian Genius Billionaire.</p>
      <p>But the entrepreneurial clan could be in for drama on another level if Caitlyn Jenner decides to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/kardashian-gossip-desperately-need-caitlyn-jenner-im-celebrity-jungle-11078453/">spill the tea on</a> <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m a Celebrity 2019</a>.</p>
      <p>Do the Kardashians get along with step-father <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> now and what went down between them?</p>
      <p>As Caitlyn prepares to make her jungle debut, here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>Where do Caitlyn Jenner and the Kardashians stand now?</h3>
      <p>It’s hard to keep up – pun intended – with this lot, but here’s what we know about how the family ties are looking lately.</p>

      <p>As seen on the show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, the two went through a rocky patch after Caitlyn released her memoir where it was perceived that Caitlyn was making digs at Kris, and the Kardashian lifestyle.</p>
      <p>In the book, Caitlyn wrote ‘that anytime a Kardashian is on television, many in the public tend to think it is a publicity stunt to make money’.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn acknowledged that the two lost touch, remarking that it was a ‘<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/09/04/caitlyn-jenner-says-not-speaking-to-step-daughter-kim-kardashian-has-been-a-big-loss-in-her-life-6900984/">big loss in her life’</a>.</p>
      <p>However, it looks like Kim, 39, and Caitlyn have reconnected lately.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/kardashians-celebrate-caitlyn-jenners-70th-birthday-style-slap-meal-nobu-malibu-11011750/">Kim was spotted at Caitlyn’s 70<sup>th</sup> birthday</a> celebrations earlier in October this year.</p>

      <h4>Caitlyn Jenner and Kourtney Kardashian</h4>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kourtney-kardashian/">Kourtney</a>, 40, the oldest of the Kardashians, appears to have fixed her relationship with Caitlyn.</p>
      <p>Kourtney revealed that she saw Caitlyn on Christmas Day, during a sit-down with Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live this January.</p>
      <h4>Caitlyn Jenner and Khloe Kardashian</h4>
      <p>It would appear these two have the most strained relationship of all.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/khloe-kardashian/">Khloe</a>, 35, wasn’t at Caitlyn’s 70<sup>th</sup> celebrations, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/14/caitlyn-jenner-snubs-khloe-kardashian-tribute-amazing-mothers-life-7545764/">Caitlyn left Khloe out of a social media post</a> celebrating all the ‘amazing’ mothers in her life – despite Khloe being mother to one-year-old daughterTrue.</p>
      <p>When asked if having a daughter might heal her relationship, Khloe’s response was quite telling.</p>

      <p>On the Lorraine Show, Ross King asked: ‘Will having a child affect anything between you and Caitlyn?’</p>
      <p>‘I don’t think it affects anything with Caitlyn. Things are just as they are,’ Khloe responded.</p>

      <p>In a recent episode of Keeping Up it’s also Kris who insists on Caitlyn being invited to the family Christmas bash.</p>
      <p>Talk about a healthy break-up.</p>
      <h4>Caitlyn Jenner and Kylie Jenner</h4>

      <p>Her and Kylie remain close, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/im-celebs-caitlyn-jenner-heaps-praise-wonderful-daughter-kylie-ahead-jungle-appearance-11069918/">Caitlyn heaping praise on her daughter</a> ahead of her time in the jungle.</p>
      <p>Even if she does <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/12/caitlyn-jenner-accidentally-shares-snap-kendall-kylies-birthday-cringing-10560174/">confuse one daughter with the other, even on her birthday</a>…</p>

      <p>The two were rumoured to have <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/03/caitlyn-jenner-withdraws-trademark-skincare-line-amid-clash-daughters-kylie-kendall-8430156/">clashed over a patent for a skincare line</a> – a problem every family faces, no? – but it would appear that’s all dealt with now.</p>
