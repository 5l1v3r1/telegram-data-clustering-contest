      <h1>Harry Styles Debuts “Watermelon Sugar” On ‘Saturday Night Live’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:38:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:38</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Kelley</a></address>
      <p>The rollout for <a href="https://genius.com/artists/harry-styles">Harry Styles</a>’ sophomore album <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Harry-styles/Fine-line">Fine Line</a></i> just ramped up as the former boybander debuted <a href="https://genius.com/Harry-styles-watermelon-sugar-lyrics">“Watermelon Sugar”</a> while pulling double duty as the host on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>.</p>
      <p>Produced by <a href="https://genius.com/artists/tyler-johnson">Tyler Johnson</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/kid-harpoon">Kid Harpoon</a>, Styles spins a sensual tale about romance:</p>
      <blockquote>Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'<br/>And it sounds just like a song<br/>I want your belly and that summer feelin'<br/>I don’t know if I could ever go without</blockquote>
      <p>As Genius user @<a href="https://genius.com/tirelessmess">tirelessmess</a> points out, the pop star’s ex-girlfriend Camille Rowe previously told <i><a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/beauty/articles/a34467/camille-rowe-beauty-interview/">Elle</a></i> that Richard Brautigan’s <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Watermelon-Sugar-Richard-Brautigan/dp/0099437597/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=In+Watermelon+Sugar&amp;qid=1574017731&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">In Watermelon Sugar</a></i> is one of her favorite books.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Styles spoke to <i><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/harry-styles-cover-interview-album-871568/">Rolling Stone</a></i>’s Rob Sheffield about becoming an active reader. “Reading didn’t really used to be my thing. I had such a short attention span,” he said. “But I was dating someone who gave me some books; I felt like I had to read them because she’d think I was a dummy if I didn’t read them.”</p>
      <p>He dropped the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-x3uD5z1bQ">studio version</a> of the track less than an hour ahead of his <i>SNL</i> performance. Naturally, the <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/harry-styles-pants">noted aficionado of high-waisted pants</a> color-coordinated his outfit with the song title.</p>
      <p>He previously teased the track with a reference to <a href="https://genius.com/Harry-styles-kiwi-lyrics">“Kiwi”</a>:</p>
