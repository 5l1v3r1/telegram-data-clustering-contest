      <h2>The event marked the beginning of 2019-20 BRM season</h2>

      <p>As We R Cycling, a professional association of cyclists, launched its first BRM (Brevet de Randonneurs Mondiaux) for 2019-20 for a 300-km distance, nine riders from Mangaluru received the Randonneur badge.</p>
      <p>Mangalore BRMs, nicknamed ‘the most entertaining and challenging BRMs’ in India in the cycling fraternity, this BRM was no different, from Mangaluru to climbing the Agumbe Ghat and then descending towards the scenic Maravanthe before riding back to Mangaluru within 20 hours.</p>
      <p>Entrepreneur and industrialist Walter D’Souza flagged off the BRM in Mangaluru at 6 a.m. on Saturday with 11 riders. He said events like BRMs provide wholesome exercise to the body and mind. He hoped that Mangaluru City Corporation would create infrastructure for cycling. He said he would champion the cause to pursue the administration for better infrastructure for cycling in the city. Passing through the rolling terrains towards the Western Ghats, heat and humidity caught the riders off-guard. The 1,000 m elevation spike in 10 km at Agumbe Ghat right before the turning point made even experienced riders walk or drag through the climb. A heavy afternoon shower offered some respite from the heat as the riders struggled to keep up the time at the control points. After the descent, they touched Maravathe beach and then rode 110 km back to Mangaluru along the Arabian sea.</p>
      <p>The 11 who participated included Jossie Mendonca, 62, from the USA, 60-year-old Joseph Pereira, Harivijay Kudva, the youngest of all, Gururaju Patil, Rajesh Nayak, Naveen Kotian, Mohibb Hussain, Koushik Boloor, Nithin Mohan, Shyamprasad Nayak, Sarvesha Samaga. Nine completed the event before the 2 a.m. Sunday deadline. WeRC is geared up to host its signature 600 km BRM, ‘Palace on Wheels’, soon, said its president Sarvesh Samaga in a release.</p>
