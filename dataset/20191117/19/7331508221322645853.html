      <p>Georgia edged past Alabama to No. 4 in The Associated Press college football poll after the Bulldogs had a quality road victory and the Crimson Tide lost star quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa">Tua Tagovailoa</a> for the season.</p>
      <p>LSU remained No. 1 in the AP Top 25 presented by Regions Bank, receiving 54 first-places votes. No. 2 Ohio State (five first-place votes) and No. 3 Clemson (three first-place votes) maintained their spots. Georgia moved up one place after winning 21-14 at Auburn.</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide beat Mississippi State 38-7 on Saturday, but <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28093292/alabama-quarterback-tua-tagovailoa-season-done-dislocated-hip">Tagovailoa dislocated his right hip</a> while being tackled late in the second quarter and is done for the year. Alabama fell a spot to fifth.</p>
      <p>Minnesota and Baylor both lost for the first time and dropped in the rankings. The 11th-ranked Gophers slipped four spots after losing at Iowa. No. 13 Baylor dropped one after blowing a 28-3 lead at home to Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>Iowa jumped four to No. 19 and Oklahoma moved up two spots to No. 8.</p>

        <b>POLL POINTS</b>

      <p>• Three two-loss teams.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Alabama extended its record for consecutive weeks in the top five of the AP poll to 67, dating back to Nov. 8, 2015. The second-longest streak of top-five appearances is Miami, which had 55 from Oct. 8, 2000-Oct. 26, 2003.</p>
