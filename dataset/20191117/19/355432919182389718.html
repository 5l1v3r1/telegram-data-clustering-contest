      <h1>Scalise: Louisiana defeat doesn't make Trump 'look bad'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:27:15+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/zack-budryk" target="_blank">Zack Budryk</a></address>
      <p>House Minority Whip <a href="https://thehill.com/people/steve-scalise">Steve Scalise</a> (R-La.) said Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards’s (D) reelection by a narrow margin Saturday did not make <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> “look bad” after Trump visited the state three times in support of Republican candidate Eddie Rispone.</p>
      <p>“What he said was he'd be made to look bad whether he came in the state or not. Eddie Rispone made up about a 22-point disadvantage over the last month because of President Trump's involvement. So Eddie Rispone was at about 27 in the primary. He ended up at 49,” Scalise told Fox News’s <a href="https://thehill.com/people/christopher-chris-wallace">Chris Wallace</a> on “Fox News Sunday.”</p>
      <p>“So clearly President Trump's involvement made a big difference at helping close that massive gap, and, look, the governor's polling showed he was above 50 before President Trump first started getting involved. That forced a runoff,” Scalise added. Trump did not make an endorsement in the primary, urging supporters to vote for either Rispone or his competitor, Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-La.). No candidate achieved a simple majority, forcing the Nov. 16 runoff election.</p>
      <p>Rispone polled at 27 percent against Abraham in Louisiana’s jungle primary rather than in head-to-head polling against Edwards. Most polling conducted after the Oct. 12 primary showed Rispone and Edwards within 2 points of each other. Trump and Scalise both stumped for Rispone at a Thursday rally.</p>
      <p>Trump offered a similar explanation after incumbent Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) was defeated in his reelection bid by Kentucky Attorney General Andrew Beshear (D) earlier this month.</p>
      <p>"@MattBevin picked up at least 15 points in last days, but perhaps not enough (Fake News will blame Trump!)," Trump tweeted after the Kentucky vote.</p>
