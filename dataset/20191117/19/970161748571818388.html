      <h3>When did Gabby and Myles meet?</h3>
      <p>The couple first started dating back in September 2018 but ended their romance in mid-August 2019.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘They [Rak-Su bandmates] are really supportive and they totally understand. I would love to stay in the band but if other opportunities come along my way as well after this, you have to take it by the scruff of the neck.’</p>
