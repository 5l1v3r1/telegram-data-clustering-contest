      <p>A 32-year-old man was burnt to death after a fire broke out at a shoe factory in outer Delhi’s Narela, the police said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The body was beyond recognition and it is suspected to be of security guard Mangal Mandal, a resident of Bihar, they said.</p>
      <p>Chief Fire Officer Atul Garg said they received a call regarding the fire around 12.45 a.m. “The fire started from the ground floor of the factory and spread to the other floors. A total of 24 fire tenders were rushed to the spot. Firefighters brought the blaze under control within an hour,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mandal’s body was near the stairs on the top floor of the factory, the official said, adding that the floor’s gate was locked from the inside.</p>
      <p>“We suspect that he was trying to escape but got stuck in the building as raw material inside the factory created a lot of smoke,” the fire official said, adding that the victim worked on the night shift. All three stories were engulfed in the blaze.</p>
      <p>Factory owner Praveen Kumar told the police that it was a holiday on Saturday and only Mandal was inside. We are probing if there was any other person trapped inside,” said Gaurav Sharma, DCP (Outer North).</p>
