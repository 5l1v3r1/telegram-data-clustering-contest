      <h2>R.V. Ramani receives Bala Kailasam Memorial Award</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:43:50+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:43</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>Well-known documentary film-maker R.V. Ramani received the Bala Kailasam Memorial Award 2019 for his film <i>Oh that’s Bhanu, </i>on 95-year-old dancer Bhanumathi Rao, at the Tagore Film Centre in Chennai on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The film explores themes of memory and time via Bhanumathi, who is suffering from memory loss herself. <i>Oh That’s Bhanu </i>is a film that looks into the journey of Bhanumathi as a dancer and a theatre actor through the eyes of her daughters and Ms. Bhanumathi herself.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the film, Mr. Ramani said it was heartwarming to receive the Bala Kailasam Award for a film that he started in the year Bala Kailasam passed away.</p>
      <h3>Nullifying the truth</h3>
      <p>“I started this film in 2014, when Kailasam passed away. It is strange that after completing this film, I am here,” said Mr. Ramani. He said he decided to make a film on Ms. Bhanumathi after he felt a connection with her, when he met her for the first time at her daughter Maya Rao’s house in New Delhi.</p>
      <p>Responding to a question about whether her difficulty in remembering her past proved to be hurdle in getting to the truth, he said: “Most of the time, Bhanumathi is making up things — she had to make up things. I don’t believe in the idea of truth. I always nullify the truth. Here, the character itself nullifies it.”</p>
      <p>Speaking about R.V. Ramani’s career, S. Panneerselvam, Readers’ Editor of <i>The Hindu</i>, said: “Whether it is a tragedy like tsunami or the recurring music season, Ramani has documented it in a particular manner — not in the academic sense, but as a practitioner. This has opened the space for the film. One of the reasons why we selected the film was that it retained the space for everybody’s idea of memory — it is not cast in stone and it is fluid.”</p>
