      <p>Sunday proved to be a quiet day on the election trail, with many leading figures turning to TV appearances to get their party message across.</p>
      <p>CBI chief Carolyn Fairbairn set out what UK businesses want to see from government following the election, while Jeremy Corbyn stood firm on SNP calls for a second referendum on Scottish independence.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the highlights of Sunday’s campaign trail:</p>
      <p>

      </figure>
      <p>Confederation of British Industry director-general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said Labour’s policies could “crack the foundations of our economy”, while Tory immigration plans risk creating a skills shortage.</p>
      <p>She said December’s election is an “extraordinary” one for business, hailing 2020 as the most important year in a generation due to recent uncertainty over Brexit.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Labour has promised a pay rise of up to £6,000 to minimum wage workers</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>The party has vowed to give workers who earn the national minimum wage at least £9,000 more by 2024 than the Tories.</p>
      <p>Workers who currently earn a minimum wage job would get an immediate pay rise of between £3,444 and £5,986 under the party’s plans.</p>
      <p>

      <p>The party’s proposals will prioritise tackling child poverty by abolishing the two-child limit for Universal Credit and ending the benefits cap.</p>
      <p>A Lib Dem government would also plan to invest in boosting the Local Housing Allowance by linking it to average rents in each area.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The Prime Minister said that all Conservative parliamentary candidates have vowed to vote for his Brexit deal if he wins a majority at the General Election.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, he said this pledge means that voters can be “100%” certain that a Tory government will “unblock” Parliament and deliver Brexit.</p>

      <p>The Labour leader said he would “certainly not” consider having a ballot on Scotland leaving the UK within his first year of government.</p>
      <p>He ruled out a referendum before the next Holyrood election in 2021, and said: “Up until then, certainly not.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tweet of the day</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Twitter, a sobering video shared by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn shone a sombre light on the NHS.</p>
      <p>The clip features Jayne Rae, a terminal cancer patient and Labour campaigner who emotionally shared her experience of a trip to a hospital ward this week.</p>

        <b>Picture of the day</b>
      </p>
      <p>The SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Scotland’s desire for independence is “unstoppable” and must not be blocked by the next prime minister.</p>
      <p>But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn ruled out holding another independence referendum before the Holyrood elections in 2021, despite SNP demands for a vote next year.</p>
