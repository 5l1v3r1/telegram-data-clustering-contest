      <p>General Motors is slated to be working on a slew of new electric vehicles and there have been separate rumors regarding three in particular. The next-generation <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/cadillac/escalade">Cadillac Escalade</a> is <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/next-generation-cadillac-escalade-has-a-radical-new-powerplant">rumored to receive an electric variant </a>and GM is also set to <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/confirmed-chevrolet-silverado-is-going-all-electric">release an electric pickup truck </a>based on either the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/silverado-1500">Chevrolet Silverado</a> or <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/gmc/sierra-1500">GMC Sierra</a>. The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/hummer-set-to-return-as-all-electric-truck">Hummer brand is also slated to make a return</a> as an all-electric truck as part of GM's $3 billion investment towards electric vehicles.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2019/11/14/forecast-firm-says-gm-will-build-electric-sierra-escalade-detroit-hamtramck-plant/4196250002/">Detroit News</a> reports that all three of these new electric vehicles - the Escalade, Sierra, and Hummer - will all be assembled at the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant according to intelligence collected by industry forecast company LMC Automotive.</p>

      <p>Jeff Schuster, an industry analyst with LMC, believes that the Hummer pickup truck will enter production in 2021 with an unnamed electric van and SUV model also beginning production in the same year. The Sierra will enter production by 2023 but the Silverado was not mentioned in the report. GM has not publicly announced its plans for the plant, which was originally scheduled to be left idle until January 2020.</p>
      <p>As part of the negotiations with the United Auto Workers union, the plant is set to reopen with GM's $3 billion investment, which will create 2,225 new jobs. "It's certainly good for the city of Detroit and the plant going from being shuttered to the future," Schuster said.</p>

      <p>The Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant currently builds the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/impala">Chevrolet Impala</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/cadillac/ct6">Cadillac CT6</a> but is set to end production of both models starting in February 2020 (six weeks late due to the strike). By 2023, GM will build a total of 23 all-electric models, five of which are now rumored to come from Detroit-Hamtramck.</p>
      <p>We are most excited to see the Hummer brand make a return but an electric Escalade should also be a major competitor in the luxury EV space. GM will have its hands full by the time the electric Sierra arrives, as it will have Tesla's pickup truck and Rivian to compete against.</p>
