      <p> A 24 year-old man caught in possession of cannabis at his home in a village near Carrick-on-Suir, has been directed by a judge to make a €500 donation to Carrick-on-Suir District Court poor box. </p>
      <p>Judge Terence Finn gave Edmond Allen of 30 Belline Way, Banagher Court, Piltown a chance to avoid a  conviction by making this donation after the defendant  pleaded guilty to possessing the illegal drug at his home on March 21. </p>
      <p>Sgt. Carol O'Leary said Det. Gda. Power called to Mr Allen's address on this date. He met the defendant who handed over two small bags of cannabis valued at €80. Mr Allen had two previous convictions for road traffic offences. </p>
      <p>Solicitor Michael Quirk siad his client was unemployed and doing a security course. He co-operated with gardai and the drug was for his personal use. The solicitor pleaded that his client was anxious to avoid a formal conviction and was willing to pay a contribution to the court poor box. </p>
      <p>Judge Finn adjourned the case to the February 6 sitting of the court for payment of the €500 contribution.</p>
