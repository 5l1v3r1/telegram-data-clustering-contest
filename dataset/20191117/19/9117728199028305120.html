        <b>Lewis Hamilton has apologised to Alex Albon for making contact in the dying laps at the Brazilian Grand Prix, ruining the Thai driver's chance of a first podium in the sport. Albon was running P2 when Hamilton sent an optimistic move up the inside in the middle sector, tapping Albon's rear right and sending him into a spin.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Albon eventually finished P14, and Hamilton lost a position to Pierre Gasly, and may lose even more if he is given a penalty for the crash.</p>

      <p>He told Rubens Barrichello after the race:Â <i>"Max did a great job - he was very fair the way he positioned the car. Massive apologies to Albon - the gap was there but it was completely my fault.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"They did a fantastic job, they outperformed us on the straights - he raced my heart out and took a lot of risks today, as you could see.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"We threw every and the kitchen sink at it. We could keep up through the corners but on the straights I don't think there was anything we could do."</i>
