      <p>The Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Chennai, has awarded a compensation of about ₹40.47 lakh to the kin of D. Chinnakkannu, 28 year-old mason who died in a road accident in 2016.</p>
      <p>According to a petition filed by his family members, on March 8, 2016, Chinnakkannu was at a tea shop near Thirucherai on the Chennai–Madurai National Highway. A car driven at a high speed hit the central median and then the motorcycle, which was parked on the pedestrian way, and dashed against a lorry.</p>
      <p>Chinnakkannu, who was sitting on the motorcycle, was thrown off the vehicle and sustained multiple injuries all over his body and died on the spot.</p>
      <p>P. Muthuswamy, the owner of the car and United India Insurance Co Ltd, its insurer, were named respondents.</p>
      <p>Though, the insurer denied the manner of the accident and the nature of death, the FIR copy, the postmortem certificate and the death report filed by the petitioners clearly proved that the accident took place only due to rash and negligent driving by the car driver, the Tribunal said and directed the insurer to pay the compensation.</p>
      <p>Out of the total compensation, the wife of the deceased is entitled to get ₹8,47,500, his two minor sons are entitled to get ₹15,00,000 each, it said.</p>
