      <p>American actress Bella Thorne has apparently moved to once again rock social media with a new sizzling hot photoshoot of hers, made on a rather peculiar occasion.</p>
      <p>A series of photos posted on Bella’s Instagram page feature her clad in a revealing swimsuit, posing aboard what appears to be a boat.</p>

      <blockquote>"I woke up with my period and this is how excited I am", she wrote in the caption.</blockquote>
      <p>This stunt evoked a mixed reaction from her social media following, with some people appearing puzzled by Bella’s explanation while others looked amused by it.</p>
      <p>"Are you joking," one user inquired.</p>
      <p>"Just love your smile", reacted another.</p>
      <p>"Making periods look sexy," quipped third.</p>
      <p>As The Blast points out, Bella's boyfriend, Italian pop-star Benjamin Mascolo, also seemed "very relieved and happy" by this reveal, calling her "the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen in my entire life."</p>
      <p>Last month, Bella also managed to wow the online community with a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201910251077151559-its-getting-nasty-bella-thorne-stuns-online-crowd-with-sizzling-hot-bikini-dance/">similar stunt</a> when she posted a video of her dancing by the poolside while dressed in a bikini</p>
