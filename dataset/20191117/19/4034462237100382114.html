      <p>Brembo brakes are iconic, as well as being the go-to brand for<a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/brembo-pumps-the-brakes-on-boring-calipers"> performance carmakers</a>. The Italian brake system specialist has been around since 1961 and started working with Alfa Romeo in 1964. Through the 1980s, Brembo also supplied brakes for BMW, Chrysler, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, and Nissan. The company also makes braking systems for Formula 1, MotoGP, IndyCar, and Formula E teams.</p>
      <p>Brembo has now struck up a partnership with General Motors Performance Engineering and released a new performance brake upgrade kit for GM's lineup of full-size trucks and SUVs.</p>

      <p>Brembo</p>
      <p>That means you can now get a Brembo brake system upgrade for the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/cadillac/escalade-hybrid">Cadillac Escalade</a>, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/silverado-1500">Chevrolet Silverado</a>, Tahoe, Suburban, and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/gmc/sierra-1500">GMC Sierra</a>, Yukon, and Yukon XL. According to Brembo, GM challenged its engineers to design a 6-piston caliper that would fit within 20 different wheel profiles. That allows the kit to fit in a wide variety of GM production and accessory wheels and meant that Brembo had to develop a unique compact fixed aluminum, six-piston caliper. Brembo says that the biggest challenge, amongst the many, was cooling. The team also had to take into account the vehicles being used on-road, off-road, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/california-highway-patrol-pulls-over-ridiculously-dangerous-convoy">and for towing</a>.</p>

      <p>"This unique 6-piston red caliper wraps around a large, vented rotor that not only looks great and fills the wheel opening, but also contributes to optimized braking and better control when hauling loads or pulling a trailer. Together with GM, these packages have been validated for quality and performance, as well as for ease of installation by the local dealer or for the do-it-yourself mechanic."</p>
      <p>The kit consists of six-piston front brakes with 16-inch Duralife steel rotors that give an 84 percent increase in brake pad area and a 42 percent increase in rotor area over the stock brakes. According to Brembo, the package can be installed by a dealer but includes all the necessary hardware and instructions for a do-it-yourself installation.</p>
