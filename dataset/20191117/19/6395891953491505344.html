      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - The Ohio Department of Health says nearly 200 women died from pregnancy-related causes over a recent eight-year period and many of their deaths were preventable.</p>
      <p>A report the department issued Friday identified 186 pregnancy-related deaths between 2008 and 2016, a ratio of 14.7 per 100,000 live births. Black women were more than 2.5 times more likely to die of a pregnancy-related condition than white women.</p>
      <p>The leading underlying causes were heart conditions, infections, severe bleeding and pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.</p>
      <p>Data showed 57% of the deaths from 2012 to 2016 could have been prevented. The state says it's received $12 million in federal grants that it plans to direct to support its maternal mortality prevention efforts.</p>
      <p>Ohio's pregnancy-related mortality ratio is significantly lower than the U.S. ratio.</p>
