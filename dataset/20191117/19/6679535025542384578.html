      <p>Expelled AMMK leader V. Pugazhendhi on Sunday sought to link his decision to rejoin the AIADMK with the “smooth re-entry” of late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s jailed aide V.K. Sasikala into the ruling party.</p>
      <p>At a press conference, Mr. Pugazhendhi side-stepped questions on whether he had consulted with Ms. Sasikala about his decision to re-join the AIADMK. “Having been part of the AIADMK for more than 30 years, Ms. Sasikala will take a decision [on rejoining the party] herself,” he said, adding, “As a friend, I will extend my help on a humanitarian basis.”</p>
      <p>The T.T.V. Dhinakaran-led AMMK will be subsumed by the AIADMK, he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Pugazhendhi praised Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami as the “hero of Tamil Nadu”. With the return of AMMK cadre to the AIADMK, the ruling party will romp home with a massive victory in the forthcoming civic polls, he said.</p>
