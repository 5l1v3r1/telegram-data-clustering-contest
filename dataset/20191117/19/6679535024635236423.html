      <p>In the run up to the Delhi Assembly polls, likely to be held early next year, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) city convener Gopal Rai on Sunday announced the launch of a booth-level ‘mass contact’ campaign, which will be led by party MLA’s in each of 70 Assembly constituencies.</p>
      <p>The MLAs will organise ‘Jan Samwads’ at 4-5 booths in their constituencies every day, Mr. Rai said. At these meetings, work carried out by previous city governments, as well as AAP’s own track record over the last five years, will be discussed.</p>
      <p>In constituencies without an MLA, the campaign will be carried out by the Vidhan Sabha incharge along with the ‘Sangathan Mantri’. The party will also begin forming booth-level poll committees through this campaign, Mr. Rai said.</p>
      <p>Around 2,700 ‘mandal incharges’, already appointed by the party, will be present at these meetings and lead the process to form the panels, he said. The campaign will be monitored by up to 70 “observers”.</p>
