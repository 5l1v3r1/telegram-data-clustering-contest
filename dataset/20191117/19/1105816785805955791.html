      <h1>Fazl’s claim further fuels talk of PTI’s troubles with allies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:33:58+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/8754/our-correspondent-6/" target="_blank">​ Our Correspondent</a></address>
      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman has stirred up a buzz in the country’s political circles with an astonishing claim: The Chaudhrys of Gujrat, who negotiated with him on the government behalf during his dharna, are no longer an ally of the ruling PTI.</p>
      <p>The politico-religious leader’s “revelation” was, however, quickly repudiated by Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, Speaker Punjab Assembly, who said his party – the PML-Q – has no plans to pull out of the PTI-led coalition.</p>

      <p>In an interview with a private TV channel, the Maulana insisted that Elahi had actually endorsed his anti-government stance when he had left after meeting him during the dharna. The cleric also denied he had struck any deal with the government.</p>
      <p>Elahi revealed in a television interview that the cleric had called off his 13-day-long dharna in Islamabad as a result of an “understanding” with government negotiators.</p>
      <p>“He [Pervaiz] was speaking from his own perspective. JUI-F activists will not end their protest until the government steps down,” the Maulana said.</p>
      <p>Similar to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s prediction a day earlier, the Maulana also predicted that there would a new prime minister next year. “I can’t tell you how that will happen, but we won’t rest until he [Prime Minister Imran Khan] resigns,” he added.</p>
      <p>The JUI-F chief contended that his ‘Azadi March’ was not a failure and the ‘Plan B’ of his strategy – blocking roads and highways across the country – was actually putting more pressure on the government.<br/>Speculations that the ruling party’s allies are having a second thought have been rife even before the Maulana’s statement. The PTI has recently drawn flak from the MQM-P for “failing to keep its promises and not releasing funds for Karachi’s development”.</p>
      <p>In the case of the PML-Q, they are fuelled by party chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain’s and his cousin Elahi’s different take on the issue of allowing former premier Nawaz Sharif to travel abroad for medical treatment.</p>
      <p>The Chaudhry brothers have opposed the government’s move to place conditions for removing the ailing Sharif family patriarch’s name from the no-fly-list.</p>
      <p>However, Elahi has said that his party would remain an ally of the PTI.</p>
      <p>“What I said [about Nawaz’s travel abroad] was for PM Imran’s own good,” he said in a statement. “Nobody can create misunderstandings between the PML-Q and the PTI.”</p>
      <p>The government also tried to dispel the impression about a rift between the PTI and its ally.</p>
      <p>Federal Economic Affairs Minister Hammad Azhar told the media that the Chaudhry brothers were “strong allies” of the government and would remain so.</p>
      <p>To a question, the minister said the government had never politicised the matter of Nawaz’s health. “The PML-N itself politicised the issue whereas the government has honoured the Lahore High Court’s decision.</p>
      <p>
        <b>JUI-F protests</b>
      </p>
      <p>JUI-F workers continued to block major highways in different parts of the country as part of the second phase of their party’s anti-government campaign.</p>

      <p>They blocked Quetta-Chaman Highway in the Qilla Abdullah by staging a sit-in. Addressing the protesters, JUI-F General Secretary Abdul Ghafoor Haideri said the achievements of the ‘Azadi March’ would start unfolding soon. “The year 2020 is the year of Imran Khan’s replacement,” he added.</p>
      <p>The JUI-F leader said the PML-N and the PPP were part of the opposition and it did not bother his party if they had gained from ‘Azadi March’.</p>
