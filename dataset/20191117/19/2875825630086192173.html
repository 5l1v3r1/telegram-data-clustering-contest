      <p>Furious Strictly Come Dancing fans raged that the show was "ruined" after Michelle Visage became the eighth contestant to leave the competition this evening.</p>
      <p>Raging viewers flocked to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> and lashed out at the show after the judges chose to send her and Giovanni Pernice home - despite the pair receiving consistently high scores in the previous weeks.</p>
      <p>One viewer raged: "um @michellevisage deserved to be in the final because of her incredible dancing talent, and she got kicked out half way just because she wanted to create something meaningful for a community that has supported her. and she executed it flawlessly. absolute MESS #strictlyspoiler."</p>
      <p>While another commented: "Michelle’s dance had a more meaningful story. She’s a confident woman, and an amazing dancer. She proved to be consistent throughout the whole of the competition, from the start. Saffron is only good at ballroom, not latin. She should’ve been kicked off. #strictlyspoiler."</p>
      <p>A third remarked: "How the absolute F**k is the flop of a social media star like Safron still in Strictly over an amazing woman like Michelle??! I don't get it. Social media stars shouldn't be on telly. Their platform is online, let them stay there!! #StrictlySpoiler."</p>

      <p>"#StrictlySpoiler I am so, so upset with the result. I feel like Michelle leaving really shows how small our community is and how people still have such a flippant attitude towards us. @michellevisage we love you and you're the best ally to us ️," another wrote.</p>
      <p>One fumed: "Such a shame as Michelle really was top 3 and a finalist in my eyes. This years strictly has been so unpredictable and it’s a real shame that so much genuine potential has left too soon whilst more average dancers (imo) are cruising through #StrictlySpoiler."</p>

      <p>Michelle and Giovanni landed in the bottom two with YouTuber Saffron and AJ Pritchard, meaning both couples had to dance again.</p>
      <p>Michelle and Giovanni performed their couples choice dance, which was street commercial, to Madonna's iconic Vogue.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Saffron and AJ Quickstepped to Beverley Knight's Marvellous Party in a bid to impress the judges.</p>
      <p>Craig Revel Horwood deliberated over the decision, admitting that he found it difficult to pick who to save.</p>

      <p>Eventually, however, he said: "I'm having a really difficult time with myself over this. This doesn’t normally happen to me. I normally make a very quick, instant decision. This has been really, really difficult.</p>
      <p>"One couple took all the notes on board and one couple were better. And the couple I’ve decided I would like to save is save is Saffron and AJ."</p>
      <p>Motsi Mabuse also decided to save Saffron and AJ after saying that they had seen "two brilliant dances".</p>
      <p>Finally, Bruno Tonioli agreed, saying that Saffron and AJ's dance was "on the money".</p>

      <p>"Ahh, it’s so competitive its unbelievable," he said. "First I want to congratulate both of you. You both really raised the game tonight – much, much better than Saturday.</p>
      <p>"And it’s very hard to decide but based on what I saw somebody I really thought nailed the dance. Right on the money. Saffron and AJ."</p>
      <p>Head Judge Shirley Ballas said that she agreed with her fellow judges and would have sent Michelle and Giovanni home.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, Michelle branded her experience "amazing" and that she couldn't have done the show without her pro partner Giovanni.</p>

      <p>"At 51 years old and never danced in my life, I never thought I’d be able to do what I have done and to have such an incredible partner," Michelle said. "To be here for my husband and my kids and the entire community, that’s why I did what I did. I am so honoured to be welcomed by my new friends here.”</p>
      <p>Speaking about Giovanni, she said: "Obviously I couldn’t have done it without him. He has been so amazing, so transformative. Just my rock and my best friend throughout this entire competition. He could take it as much as he could dish it, and I needed somebody like that. I’m going to miss seeing him every day. I would never have wanted to do this with anyone else.”</p>
      <p>Giovanni added: "You are wonderful. We laugh, we cry, we fight and we argue and we’v e done everything but I’ve loved every single second. I think you are inspirational and we did this dance and wanted to send a message.</p>
      <p>"You are a phenomenal lady and I am so proud of everything we’ve done. I’m here to say thank you, thank you, thank you."</p>
