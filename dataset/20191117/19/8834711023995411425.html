      <h1>Bafana Bafana Beats Sudan In Afcon Qualifiers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:57:47+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/sporteditor/" target="_blank">SW Editor</a></address>
      <p>Bafana Bafana beat Sudan 1-0 in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations Group C qualifier on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Thapelo Morena had the first chance on goal for Bafana but his short-range effort just went wide. In the fourth minute, France-based striker Lebo Mothiba had a chance to opening the scoring but his miss also went wide of goal.</p>
      <p>Thulani Serero then tried his chances from outside the box but his long-range effort failed to hit the target. A chance was then created for Mothiba again but he failed to convert from close range.</p>
      <p>With frustrating growing from the crowd, Mothiba used fancy footwork to create space for himself within the box; but he took one touch too many as he was eventually crowded out of taking a shot at the target.</p>
      <p>In the 20th minute, there was a penalty appeal from Serero, who claimed the ball touched a Sudanese player’s arm in the box, but the referee waved it away.</p>
      <p>Having absorbed the early pressure, they showed attacking intent through captain, Ramadan Shareif, who attempted a bicycle kick but Ronwen Williams saved comfortably.</p>
      <p>Kamohelo Mokotjo then tried to score from outside the box but his effort is also easily saved by Ali Aboeshren as the game reached the half-hour mark with no goals.</p>
      <p>After good footwork from Mothiba again in the 40th minute, Lebogang Phiri had a chance to score – but his effort was blocked by a defender.</p>
      <p>Just before halftime, Dean Furman looked to get his name on the score sheet but his long-range effort went wide.</p>
      <p>Phiri would eventually make the breakthrough on the stroke of halftime as his left-footed strike broke the deadlock for his first goal in Bafana colours.</p>
      <p>Bafana started the second-half stronger with Morena passing in the box but it was cut out before Mothiba could reach it.</p>
      <p>In the 66th minute goal scorer Phiri was stretchered off and was replaced by Lebogang Manyama.</p>
      <p>Ntseki then went for an all-out attack, as he brought on striker Bradley Grobler and Kermit Erasmus for Mothiba and Serero, respectively.</p>
      <p>Grobler then looked like he had doubled Bafana’s lead but his shot in the box was ruled offside. In the end, a solitary goal was all that was needed as SA claimed a 1-0 win for their first victory in Afcon qualifiers.</p>
