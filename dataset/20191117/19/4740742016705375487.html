      <p>The owner of a new Filton café is offering free meals to rough sleepers twice a month.</p>
      <p>Café on the Ave is opening this Friday (Nov 22), on <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/filton">Filton</a> Avenue, and boss Colton Clark hopes the business will become more than just a place to eat.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old is planning to help those in need and give something back to the community.</p>
      <p>Colton was able to open his dream business, which will serve breakfasts, salads and sandwiches, after being awarded compensation from an accident.</p>

      <p>"I grew up in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/southmead">Southmead</a> and was surrounded by a lot of crime," explained Colton. "When I got this money I wanted to use it on something worthwhile."</p>
      <p>His colleague Charlene Balson has been promoting the event for the homeless.</p>
      <p>She said: "From December 12 the staff at Cafe on the Ave will be opening two evenings a month to provide food to all the people currently living out on the streets.</p>
      <p>"We cannot house them but we can welcome them into the café for some nice warm food. We hope this can help them in some way, we will be providing a hot meal and warm drink followed by a dessert.</p>
      <p>"We will also be using the café as a drop off for any bits and pieces like bedding, sleeping bags, quilts, pillows, blankets etc, if anyone would like to be apart of this please they can call the café."</p>
