      <h1>Manchester United could rival Arsenal for promising goalkeeper’s transfer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:53:47+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:53</time> by <a rel="author">Jaikuran Randhawa</a></address>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10364285/man-utd-arsenal-hartlepool-brad-young/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574017799">the Sun</a>, Premier League rivals Manchester United and Arsenal are keeping tabs on promising Hartlepool United goalkeeper Brad Young.</p>
      <p>The Sun add that the 6ft 4in stopper has earned a call-up to one of England’s youth sides after his solid start to the season.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old only signed a professional deal with the Conference Premier side in the summer but it seems as though he may move to greener pastures if he can continue to impress.</p>

      <p>Both clubs have established first-team stoppers in David de Gea and Bernd Leno but they could do with some younger stoppers to push their backups.</p>
      <p>Sergio Romero is United’s second-choice while Arsenal academy graduate Emi Martinez acts as Leno’s backup.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils do have Dean Henderson out on loan to Sheffield United but it’s hard to see where he’ll fit in long-term.</p>
      <p>22-year-old Henderson has impressed for the Blades so far this season and the Red Devils may have the chance to make a huge profit on the ace if they decide to sell him. He’s also been called up by England’s senior squad twice.</p>
