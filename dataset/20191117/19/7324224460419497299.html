      <p>A candlelight vigil is planned on Sunday evening to remember two students shot and killed by a classmate at his Southern California high school.</p>
      <p>It comes as investigators try to determine what prompted the deadly attack that left three other teenagers wounded.</p>
      <p>Saugus High School will remain closed until December 2 but counsellors will be available to help students cope with their grief, school district officials in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita said.</p>

      <p>Detectives were searching for a motive for the killings carried out by Nathaniel Tennosuke Berhow on Thursday, his 16th birthday.</p>
      <p>The teenager pulled a .45-caliber handgun from his backpack and shot five students at random before shooting himself in the head. He died the next day.</p>
      <p>The dead were identified as 15-year-old Gracie Anne Muehlberger and 14-year-old Dominic Blackwell.</p>
      <p>They will be honoured at a 7pm vigil at Santa Clarita’s Central Park.</p>
      <p>A wounded 14-year-old girl was released from the hospital late on Friday.</p>
      <p>A 15-year-old girl remained in hospital in good condition. A 14-year-old boy was treated and released on Thursday.</p>

      <p>Berhow had shown no signs of violence and did not appear to be linked to any ideology, authorities said.</p>
      <p>After more than 40 interviews and a search of his home, authorities still were in the dark, Captain Kent Wegener of the Sheriff’s Department’s homicide unit said at a press conference Friday.</p>
      <p>“We did not find any manifesto, any diary that spelled it out, any suicide note or any writings,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, authorities were investigating online threats against schools in and around the Santa Clarita, sheriff’s officials said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Investigators have not found any of the threats made on social media to be credible, officials said.</p>
      <p>Additional law enforcement will be posted at area schools on Monday.</p>
