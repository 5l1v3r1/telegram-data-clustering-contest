      <h1>Waste dumping: civic body to monitor CCTV camera footage</h1>
      <h2>Access sought from residential, commercial complexes</h2>

      <p>In an attempt to keep a check on dumping of waste in public areas, Tiruchi Corporation has requested access to CCTV camera footage from shops and residential buildings.</p>
      <p>Civic officials on Saturday approached shops on Madurai Road in Srirangam Zone of the city limits to request CCTV access so that they could regularly keep a check of a corner where garbage was regularly being dumped.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Hindu, S. Vaidhyanathan, Assistant Commissioner, Srirangam zone, Tiruchi City Corporation, said the idea dawned upon them when they noticed that nearby commercial buildings had CCTVs fitted.</p>
      <p>“Instead of spending more to install cameras, we requested them to allow us access whenever necessary. The shop owners too readily agreed," he said.</p>
      <p>The idea could be emulated in hotspots across the city, where public dumping was quite common, said Mr. Vaidhyanathan.</p>
      <p>"Since the Corporation removed all large bins where the public used to regularly dump waste, they have resorted to using the place where the bin used to be as a dumping area. The common misconception is that sanitary workers who come to collect waste will pick it up, which is not true,” he pointed out.</p>
      <p>Sanitary inspectors would approach buildings in front of the hotspots to seek their help in keeping the city clean, he added.</p>
      <p>The civic body also set a deadline for collection of waste from bulk waste generators.</p>
      <p>Officials said that from December 1 onwards, commercial establishments, wedding halls, etc., where waste of over 100 kg was generated, would not be collected.</p>
      <p>A total of 53 bulk waste generators had been identified and notices issued, a Corporation official said.</p>
      <p>“Many bulk waste generators have the finances to manage their own waste. But they do not do it. With such deadlines in place, they will have to adhere to norms.” the official added.</p>
