      <p>Deshaun Watson just might be a machine.</p>
      <p>The Houston Texans QB isn’t having the best 1st half against the Baltimore Ravens, but it could’ve been way worse as he got sacked in the second quarter and stayed on the ground.</p>
      <p>Replay shows his ankle being landed on behind him as a Ravens defender sacked him.</p>
      <p>He somehow stayed in the game after that.</p>
