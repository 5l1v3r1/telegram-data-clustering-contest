      <p>Twitter has become a gathering place for fandoms of all kinds. And on November 17, it also became a bit of a battle ground for fans of Zack Snyder’s DC films. To mark the two-year anniversary of Warner Bro.’s <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/justice-league-6888.html"><i>Justice League</i></a>, fans trended a hashtag with a singular goal: To get the studio to release <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478679/justice-league-crew-member-drops-f-bomb-over-the-snyder-cut">the ‘Snyder Cut’</a> of the film.</p>
      <p>It may seem like a peculiar request, if you haven’t been following the DC fandom over the past few years. But the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement has been a long time coming. In short: Zack Snyder’s abrupt departure from <i>Justice League</i> left the film a bit of a mess. And on the whole, it was not well-received by fans, who felt it didn’t do its characters justice, especially after a lot of footage was cut. In the years since, Zack Snyder has made it clear that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483465/justice-league-composer-confirms-the-snyder-cut-of-the-score">he has an extended version of the film</a> that fans are eager to see.</p>
      <p>The hashtag project is only part of the push for a Snyder cut release. And fans were definitely ready to get it trending. CinemaBlend’s own Sean O’Connell added his voice (and a snazzy t-shirt) into the mix.</p>

      <p>Fans called the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut push the “Day of Justice,” and <a href="https://twitter.com/TPZMickD/status/1196023954684751872/photo/2">announced</a> that they hoped to get 214,000 tweets attributed to the hashtag. It was immediately clear that they were taking the challenge seriously.</p>

      <p>The hashtag became a way for fans to vent two years of frustrations with Warner Bros. And the reactions ran the gamut -- and showcased the fandom’s fighting spirit and creativity. Unsurprisingly, some fans used memes to air their grievances.</p>

      <p>Other fans stuck to the basics, reminding the Twitter sphere why the hashtag was needed in the first place.</p>

      <p>Enterprising fans shared enticing <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482210/new-justice-league-set-photo-includes-henry-cavills-infamous-mustache">set photos</a> and unused footage to show everyone what they were missing with <i>Justice League</i>’s theatrical cut.</p>

      <p>Many fans also tagged Twitter handles for Warner Bros. and the company's upcoming streaming service HBO Max.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/releasethesyndercut?src=hash">#ReleaseTheSynderCut</a> hashtag wasn’t just a place for fans to air their grievances, though. They also took the time to celebrate not only Zack Snyder, but also the characters and actors they’ve grown to love.</p>

      <p>In the days leading up to November 17, some other <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484404/why-this-could-be-a-huge-week-for-justice-leagues-release-the-snyder-cut-movement">important figures</a> weighed in. Several celebrities tweeted in support of the hashtag. And Zack Snyder himself used social media to release some stills from his extended version as a part of <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484947/supermans-resurrection-teased-by-zack-snyders-latest-snyder-cut-image">his ongoing Snyder Cut series</a>. Thus far, the only major player who hasn’t responded is Warner Bros.</p>
