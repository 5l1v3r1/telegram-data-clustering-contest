      <p>(CNN) --- Ariana Grande told her fans that she's "very sick" and may have to cancel an upcoming concert.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post Saturday, the pop star said her throat and head "are still in so much pain," and it's difficult to breathe during a show. She said she'd been struggling with the illness since her concert in London last month.</p>
      <p>"I just really don't know what's happening with my body right now and need to figure it out," Grande said.</p>
      <p>Although canceling the show is "the last thing i would ever want to do," Grande wrote, fans should take the post as a "gentle heads up" in case she can't "make the show happen" on Sunday.</p>
