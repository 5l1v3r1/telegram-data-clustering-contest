      <p>MADISON, Wis. - The Wisconsin Badgers have jumped up one spot to No. 14 in the latest AP sports poll.</p>
      <p>Following their 37-21 <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/no-14-badgers-end-road-skid-in-37-21-win-at-nebraska/1142876252">win against Nebraska</a>, the Badgers are one step closer to winning the <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/wisconsin-still-has-a-chance-to-make-the-big-ten-championship-game/1142926274">Big Ten West</a>. If the Badgers win against Purdue on Saturday and move on to defeat Minnesota in the last game of the season, Wisconsin will be on to the Big Ten Championship.</p>
      <p>Georgia edged past Alabama to No. 4 in The Associated Press college football poll after the Bulldogs had a quality road victory and the Crimson Tide lost star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa for the season.</p>
      <p>LSU remained No. 1 in the AP Top 25 presented by Regions Bank, receiving 54 first-places votes. No. 2 Ohio State (five first-place votes) and No. 3 Clemson (three first-place votes) maintained their spots. Georgia moved up one place after winning 21-14 at Auburn.</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide beat Mississippi State 38-7 on Saturday, but Tagovailoa dislocated his right hip while being tackled late in the second quarter and is done for the year. Alabama fell a spot to fifth.</p>
      <p>Minnesota and Baylor both lost for the first time and dropped in the rankings. The 11th-ranked Gophers slipped four spots after losing at Iowa. No. 13 Baylor dropped one after blowing a 28-3 lead at home to Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>Iowa jumped four to No. 19 and Oklahoma moved up two spots to No. 8.</p>
