        <b>It was a dominant year for MotoGP champion Marc Marquez, who questioned whether he can replicate his remarkable consistency in 2020</b>
      </p>
      <p>Marc Marquez concedes it will be tough to replicate the phenomenal consistency he displayed en route to a sixth MotoGP championship in 2019 next season.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard rounded off a campaign to remember with a 12th win from 19 rounds, a result that secured the teams championship for Repsol Honda, while he only placed outside of the top two once.</p>
      <p>Nearest rival Andrea Dovizioso finished some 151 points adrift of Marquez, who has no doubt 2019 will be remembered as one of the best of his career.</p>
      <p>Speaking to BT Sport, he said: “It’s been amazing.</p>
      <p>“I mean 2019, I don’t know if it will be the best season of my career, but one of the best for sure.</p>
      <p>“It will be difficult to improve the consistency, there was just one crash when the leading the race.</p>
      <p>“It’s been an amazing season and to finish in a good way [is great]. The victory was important but also Repsol can celebrate the team championship, so it’s something important for Repsol.”</p>

      <p>Marquez added: “I’m very, very happy. It’s been the perfect season, it will be difficult to repeat it.</p>
      <p>“Now it’s time to enjoy it, then Tuesday we start the 2020 season.”</p>
      <p>Rookie Fabio Quartararo completed a fine debut campaign with a seventh podium finish after placing second and the Frenchman is confident he can do even better next season.</p>
      <p>“Who imagined at the end of the season we will have six poles and seven podiums?” He said.</p>
      <p>“I think nobody, we can’t ask for no more. I dedicate this to my team, everyone told me I didn’t deserve this season in MotoGP, I wanted to prove them wrong.</p>
      <p>“It’s unbelievable to finish this way. I’m really looking forward to next year, we will be stronger.”</p>
