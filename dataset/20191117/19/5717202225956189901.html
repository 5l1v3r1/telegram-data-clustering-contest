      <h1>Report: QPR take Aston Villa defender Easah Suliman on trial</h1>
      <h2>Easah Suliman is down the pecking order at Villa Park.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:15:09+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>Queens Park Rangers have taken Easah Suliman on trial, <a href="https://www.westlondonsport.com/qpr/football-coventry-city-qpr-easah-suliman-aston-villa-112019">West London Sport reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Suliman is currently on Aston Villa’s books but he is not getting a look in. It seems that QPR could move for Suliman in the January transfer window or ahead of next season.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old has been a regular for Aston Villa’s youth team this season but he is not close to the first-team. Aston Villa signed four central defenders in the summer and Dean Smith clearly prefers other options.</p>

      <p>At this stage of his career, Suliman might leave to pursue first-team football elsewhere. The England U20 international has previously spent time with Cheltenham Town, Grimsby Town and FC Emmen on loan.</p>
      <p>But with just one senior appearance for the Villans under his belt, he is now allowed to undergo a trial at QPR. The West London side will judge Suliman in the coming weeks ahead of a potential move.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view</h3>
      <p>It makes sense for Suliman to look elsewhere at this stage of his career. He needs to find a new club where game time will help him develop into a strong senior player.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t look like Aston Villa is the right environment. Suliman has the chance to impress Mark Warburton and show why he can bolster QPR’s defence.</p>
