      <p><b>TAIPEI, Taiwan — </b>A Chinese aircraft carrier fleet passed near Taiwan on Sunday, prompting the self-governing island to scramble ships and jets to monitor the situation.</p>
      <p>Taiwan’s defense ministry said the southbound Chinese fleet passed into the Taiwan Strait but stayed on China’s side of the waterway that separates the island from China.</p>
      <p>The ministry said Taiwan scrambled ships and jets to monitor the fleet.</p>
      <p>U.S. and Japanese ships were also following the Chinese fleet, the ministry said without giving details.</p>
      <p>China has passed aircraft carriers into the strait since Taiwan President Tsai lng-wen took office in 2016. China resents Tsai for declining to see Taiwan and China as parts of the same country and resents her improved relations with Washington.</p>
      <p>“We ask that our citizens not worry,” the defense ministry said in a statement via social media.</p>
      <p>The last voyage through the strait by a Chinese aircraft carrier was in June.</p>
      <p>“It has strong implications, especially for Japan and Taiwan, that China will conduct a regular patrol in this region,” said Andrew Yang, secretary-general of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies in Taiwan.</p>
      <p>“Taiwan would need to reinforce its asymmetric defense capabilities so as to deter the ongoing Chinese military upgrades,” Yang said.</p>
      <p>Asymmetric defense refers to use of strategy or unconventional arms to hold back an enemy with more overall strength. China has the world’s third-largest armed forces compared to Taiwan at No. 22, as ranked by the GlobalFirePower.com database.</p>
      <p>The Taiwan Strait is a heavily trafficked waterway, but China pays special attention to activity there by foreign navies. A U.S. cruiser passed through the Taiwan Strait on Nov. 12, the U.S. Navy said in a tweet. That passage was the ninth so far this year for the United States, Taiwan’s government-run Central News Agency reported.</p>
      <p>China has condemned previous U.S. voyages in the Taiwan Strait as meddling in the China-Taiwan issue. The second carrier is probably aimed to deterring U.S. “intervention”, Yang said.</p>
      <p>The presidential office in Taipei sent a statement Sunday asking China to “cherish” “peace and stability” with Taiwan and elsewhere in the region.</p>
      <p>The fleet seen Sunday was escorting China’s first entirely home-built aircraft carrier, the ministry statement said. It had sailed from a shipyard in northern China where it was being constructed. Work on the homegrown vessel began in 2013, the Chinese defense ministry website says.</p>
      <p>China and Taiwan have been separately ruled since the Chinese civil war of the 1940s, when Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists lost to the Communists and rebased their government on the island 160 kilometers (100 miles) away.</p>
