      <p><i>Following five solid seasons with the Pirates in which he was an All-Star and finished fourth in NL Cy Young Award voting in 2015,</i> Gerrit Cole<i>reached an elite level over two seasons with the Astros. He is tied to Draft-pick compensation if he signs with a new team after being one of <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/2020-qualifying-offer-decisions">10 players to receive the $17.8 million qualifying offer</a>.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>Below is a list of the latest news and rumors surrounding the 29-year-old right-hander, who is now a free agent.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Angels appear to be perfect fit for Cole; is that where he'll end up?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 17:</i> The Angels are considered one of the frontrunners to sign Cole for a number of reasons. The right-hander is from Orange County, Calif., the team needs an ace and wants to contend as soon as 2020, and owner Arte Moreno has never shied away from spending money.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-free-agency-perfect-fits">MLB.com's Richard Justice</a> takes it one step further, writing that the Angels and Cole are "as close to perfect as a free-agent marriage can get."</p>
      <p>Of course, just because a team appears to be an ideal fit for a free agent doesn't necessarily mean the player will end up there. Look at Patrick Corbin and the Yankees last year for proof of that. The Yanks weren't willing to match the Nationals' offer of six years and $140 million for Corbin, and the New York native ended up in Washington.</p>
      <p>Obviously, money is also going to be a major factor in deciding Cole's destination. But Cole's agent, Scott Boras, indicated the 29-year-old is prioritizing winning as well.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think geography matters to any of these guys as much as the continuance of winning and being able to achieve their goal of getting that rare ring,” Boras said at the GM Meetings. “And I think in Gerrit’s case, when you’re that close, you’re looking at this process as one where I’ve got a box to check and I want to go out and put together the best effort to put me in that position to do that.”</p>
      <p>Pairing Cole with American League MVP Award winner Mike Trout would go a long way toward helping the Angels reach the playoffs for just the second time in Trout's career. But after a 72-90 campaign in 2019, Los Angeles is more than one player away from a World Series title.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cole a West Coast guy, but might Yanks swoop in and woo him to the Bronx?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 15:</i> The Angels have been the club most mentioned when it comes to Cole's free agency, given that the right-hander is from Southern California and was drafted out of UCLA. But as MLB.com's Richard Justice points out while making some bold predictions on how offseason dominoes might start falling, the Yankees don't often lose when they really want a player on the open market. And a player like Cole -- in the prime of his career and at the height of his dominance -- doesn't wind up on the open market all that often.</p>
      <p>"While the consensus in the industry is that Cole will end up with the Angels, the Yankees were always going to be serious bidders," Justice writes. "To state the obvious, they do not finish second in free-agent pursuits very often. This signing [would rattle] both the free-agent and trade markets, especially for the Angels, who envisioned Cole being their crown jewel acquisition." <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-offseason-potential-scenarios">More &gt;</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>Ranking the top suitors for Cole</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 14:</i> Cole would make every team better -- a lot better. Only one club can land the superstar right-hander, though, which is why Will Leitch introduced MLB.com's <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/gerrit-cole-likely-landing-spots">Gerrit Cole Suitor Power Rankings</a>, breaking down the top five squads leading the chase for the 29-year-old.</p>
      <p>At the tippy top? The Dodgers, who "have spent the last few years being smart and prudent and efficient with their spending, bringing in strategically selected free agents, promoting top prospects and re-signing their old players," as Leitch wrote. "They haven’t made that massive free-agent splash. But it’s one thing to lose two straight World Series. It’s another thing to fall out in the National League Division Series."</p>
      <p>Throw in the fact that Cole is a native of Southern California, and well, Los Angeles makes a lot of sense all the way around. Plus, just imagine a rotation fronted by Cole, fellow hard-throwing righty Walker Buehler and star southpaw Clayton Kershaw.</p>
      <p>The other four clubs in the main mix: the Phillies, who could look to spend big again this offseason, this time to fix their rotation; the Rangers, who could be something of a surprise suitor in these sweepstakes; the Angels, the other LA team that already has been linked aplenty to Cole and badly needs pitching; and the Yankees, who have been after Cole ever since they drafted him out of high school in the first round in 2008 but failed to sign him away from UCLA.</p>
      <p>Find out the exact order of those four squads -- and a few other teams that could enter the fray -- in the Cole Suitor Power Rankings <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/gerrit-cole-likely-landing-spots">here</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cole finishes as runner-up for AL Cy</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 13:</i> Wednesday was as good a time as any to revisit Cole's dominant walk year. The AL Cy Young Award results were announced, with Cole finishing second in an extremely close race with teammate Justin Verlander.</p>
      <p>Cole and Verlander received every first- and second-place vote. Cole got 13 first-place votes and 17 second-place votes; Verlander got 17 first-place votes and 13 second-place votes. No other AL pitcher got a top-two vote.</p>
      <p>Just a reminder of Cole's 2019 stats: a 20-5 record, an AL-leading 2.50 ERA and a Major League-leading 326 strikeouts -- the highest single-season total since Randy Johnson's 334 in 2002.</p>
      <p>What does that mean for Cole's free agency? Well, as agent Scott Boras put it Wednesday at the GM Meetings, "If this were Major League Christmas, we would be looking at 30 stockings that would clearly want a lump of Cole."</p>
      <p>
        <b>When will Cole sign?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 13:</i> Agent Scott Boras has never been one to rush the free-agent process for his top clients, and it appears to be business as usual when it comes to Cole, according to <a href="https://www.sny.tv/yankees/news/sources-yankees-free-agent-target-gerrit-cole-expected-to-sign-after-new-year-strasburg-rendon-could-sign-sooner/311777014">SNY's Andy Martino</a>.</p>
      <p>Industry sources told Martino that Boras has indicated to interested teams that Cole is unlikely to sign before January.</p>
      <p>But Boras said Wednesday at the GM Meetings that reports that Cole won't sign until the new year aren't accurate.</p>
      <p>Last offseason, Boras negotiated a 13-year, $330 million contract for Bryce Harper with the Phillies after Spring Training had already begun. Harper's contract also came after the other elite player in last year's free-agent class, Manny Machado, had landed a 10-year, $300 million deal with the Padres.</p>
      <p>Boras represents many of this year's big-name free agents, including Cole, Stephen Strasburg, Anthony Rendon, Hyun-Jin Ryu and Dallas Keuchel, which could give him even more influence than usual over the pace of the market. That said, Martino has heard the markets for Strasburg and Rendon could move faster than expected.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Yankees not hiding interest in Cole</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 12:</i> Yankees general manager Brian Cashman put it simply at the GM Meetings on Monday. New York is interested in Cole, the top free-agent starter on the market.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"We'll talk to Cole," Cashman said, when asked about Cole and fellow free-agent ace Stephen Strasburg. "Anybody would have interest in players like that."</p>

      <p>The Yankees would have to win Cole away from his Southern California roots -- teams like the Angels that are reportedly interested -- but they'll try.</p>

        <b>Cole, Strasburg may not fit in San Diego</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 12:</i> As soon as Stephen Strasburg <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/stephen-strasburg-opts-out-of-contract">opted out of the remaining four years of his contract</a> with the Nationals, many speculated the World Series MVP possibly could find his way back to his hometown of San Diego. But how likely is that to happen?</p>
      <p>While the Padres are intent on landing a starting pitcher or two this offseason, they <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/padres/story/2019-11-12/padres-stephen-strasburg-gerrit-cole-free-agency-trades-gm-meetings">may not have the budget</a> to pony up what it will take to secure Strasburg or Cole, according to Kevin Acee of the San Diego Union-Tribune.</p>
      <p>On one hand, that might seem surprising because the Padres have spent big the past two offseasons, handing out $300 million to third baseman Manny Machado last year and $144 million to first baseman Eric Hosmer in February 2018. On the other hand, though, those very contracts could be precisely why San Diego may not be able to fit Strasburg, who attended San Diego State University before going first overall in the 2009 Draft, into the payroll this time around.</p>
      <p>Given those financial restraints, Acee suggests it may be more likely that the Padres target a free agent like Zack Wheeler, who won't command as hefty of a contract as Strasburg or Cole, the latter of whom is expected to score a record contract for a pitch.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, GM A.J. Preller could look to the trade market to add an arm, as the club's Minor League system is as deep and talented as any in the sport, so he has the chips to go that route.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Angels hoping to add 2 starters, have ability to be aggressive financially</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 11:</i> Without being too specific, Angels general manager Billy Eppler revealed Monday at the GM Meetings that he would like to add two starting pitchers this offseason, according to the <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2019/11/11/angels-pondering-rotation-configuration-around-shohei-ohtani/">Orange County Register</a>.</p>
      <p>“I can tell you that I have cast a very, very wide net,” Eppler said.</p>
      <p>There are a variety of reasons why the Angels are considered likely to pursue Cole. The team desperately needs an ace, Cole is an Orange County, Calif., native, and owner Arte Moreno has never shied away from spending money.</p>
      <p>Back in October, Moreno promised a <a href="https://twitter.com/BillShaikin/status/1187463777056251904">payroll increase</a> in 2020. And on Monday, Eppler said the Angels "have the ability to be aggressive if we want to," referring to the team's financial situation.</p>
      <p>However, it's possible the Angels' need for more than one starter could steer the club away from Cole, who is expected to command an annual salary over $30 million. Los Angeles already has roughly $115 million committed to just five players in 2020, and $88.5 million committed to three players in 2021, after which Albert Pujols' deal will come off the books.</p>
      <p>It might make more sense for the Angels to target two lower-cost options from the second tier of free-agent starting pitchers, which includes Zack Wheeler, Madison Bumgarner, Hyun-Jin Ryu and Jake Odorizzi. The Angels appear to be in the mix for at least one of those hurlers, as <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/zack-wheeler-rumors">MLB.com's Jon Paul Morosi reported Monday</a> that they are among the teams showing interest in Wheeler.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cole reportedly atop Phillies' wish list</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 10:</i> Although the Phillies were among the busiest teams in the Majors when it came to improving their roster last offseason, they did not address their rotation, opting instead to head into 2019 with Aaron Nola, Jake Arrieta, Nick Pivetta, Zach Eflin and Vince Velasquez as their starting five. But Philadelphia's priorities have changed after an 81-81 season in which the team ranked 11th in the National League in rotation ERA (4.64).</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/phillies/phillies-general-manager-meetings-gerrit-cole-scott-boras-20191110.html">Matt Breen of the Philadelphia Inquirer</a>, Phillies general manager Matt Klentak is heading to the GM Meetings, which begin Monday, with an offseason plan that centers around pitching. While Cole is at the top of the Phils' wish list, the team could look to add multiple free-agent starters, Breen writes.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://94wip.radio.com/phillies-gm-matt-klentak-wip">radio appearance on 94 WIP</a> in Philadelphia on Thursday, Klentak stressed the importance of not losing Draft picks after the team did so when it signed three players (Carlos Santana, Jake Arrieta, Bryce Harper) who rejected the qualifying offer in the past two offseasons.</p>
      <p>"One of the things we have to try to do, if we can, is to not forfeit Draft picks, and that's hard when you're fishing in the deep end of the free-agent pond," Klentak said. "But we lost our second-round pick last year and our second and third the year before. That doesn't sound like a lot, but that's where Scott Kingery comes from, that's where Spencer Howard comes from, that's where Connor Seabold comes from. That's where some good players come from."</p>
      <p>The problem for Philadelphia is that five of the top free-agent starters -- Cole, Stephen Strasburg, Zack Wheeler, Madison Bumgarner, Jake Odorizzi -- received a QO this year, which means the club's options could be limited if it indeed wants to avoid giving up another pick.</p>
      <p>Notable starters who didn't get a QO include Hyun-Jin Ryu, Dallas Keuchel and former Phillies ace Cole Hamels. Hamels has <a href="https://www.mlb.com/phillies/news/cole-hamels-open-to-return-to-phillies">expressed interest in returning</a> to the city where he spent the first 10 years of his career and won a World Series title. The veteran left-hander also said he is willing to sign a one-year deal to join a contender.</p>
      <p>While Klentak's comments may signal a hesitancy to pursue one of the QO pitchers, it's possible that Cole is the exception.</p>
      <p>Earlier this offseason, <a href="https://theathletic.com/1332419/2019/10/29/who-will-pitch-for-joe-girardis-phillies-club-will-plot-two-offseason-scenarios-with-and-without-gerrit-cole/">Matt Gelb of The Athletic (subscription required)</a> reported that the Phillies were planning to pursue Cole and were going to "plot two scenarios for this winter -- one with Cole and one without him."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Will more Cole candidates emerge this week?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 10:</i> The GM Meetings are this week in Scottsdale, Ariz., and <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/things-to-watch-for-at-general-managers-meetings">MLB.com's Mark Feinsand writes</a> that we may learn of other bidders for Cole as executives move into high-powered planning mode for 2020 this week. The Angels, Dodgers and Yankees are the three teams believed to be in the running, and Astros owner Jim Crane said that the team will attempt to re-sign him. But which other teams will we see emerge as these meetings get underway? Feinsand notes that the Phillies are always a possibility as big spenders, and the Rangers are thought to be looking to add payroll as they move to their new stadium for next season. Plus, the Padres have made surprising moves in each of the last two offseasons -- they could always be back for an encore.</p>
      <p>
        <b>If Strasburg returns to Washington, could Padres be in on Cole?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 9:</i> After adding big-name free agents (Eric Hosmer, Manny Machado) in each of the past two offseasons, the pressure is on the Padres to end a postseason drought that reached 13 years in 2019. The club needs an ace above all else, and San Diego native <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/stephen-strasburg-rumors">Stephen Strasburg is expected to be a target</a>.</p>
      <p>But if Strasburg returns to the Nationals, there's another ace righty on the free-agent market with Southern California ties the Padres could turn to. Will the team surprise again by landing Cole?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2019/11/07/gerrit-cole-team-rankings">Sports Illustrated's Michael Shapiro</a> lists San Diego among his top five contenders for the 29-year-old, writing that "we shouldn’t discount the Padres from the Cole sweepstakes," even if Strasburg is getting more buzz as a potential addition.</p>
      <p>The question is whether Padres ownership is willing to hand out another $250+ million contract, with Machado, Hosmer and Wil Myers making a combined $70 million per year over the next three years. Myers' deal will come off the books after that, assuming the Padres choose to pay him a $1 million buyout instead of picking up his $20 million option for 2023.</p>
      <p>San Diego does have Fernando Tatis Jr. and Chris Paddack on pre-arbitration deals and one of the top farm systems in the game, which could help the team build an inexpensive but talented roster around its high-priced veterans until Myers' contract ends and gives the club additional flexibility. That leaves the door open for a possible run at Strasburg and, perhaps, Cole.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Are the Yankees willing to exceed the luxury tax in 2020?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 9:</i> With the GM Meetings set to begin Monday, <a href="https://www.sny.tv/yankees/news/4-questions-yankees-brian-cashman-should-answer-at-mlb-gm-meetings/311420306">SNY's Danny Abria</a><a href="https://sny.tv/yankees/news/4-questions-yankees-brian-cashman-should-answer-at-mlb-gm-meetings/311420306">no</a> has some questions he'd like to see Yankees general manager Brian Cashman answer. Three of the questions are closely linked:</p>
      <p>1. What's the level of interest in Gerrit Cole and other top free-agent starting pitchers?<br/>2. Is the club willing to exceed the <a href="http://m.mlb.com/glossary/transactions/competitive-balance-tax">Competitive Balance Tax</a> (aka the "luxury tax") threshold?<br/>3. Will the team look to re-sign Didi Gregorius?</p>
      <p>Factoring in projected arbitration raises and players signed to Major League contracts, the Yankees' CBT figure for 2020 is already closing in on $190 million, according to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hl2xgQQReB8qPSoa2YAaDcBfkw0qYeFQFizVP3m2JZs/edit#gid=1520401900">Cot's Baseball Contracts</a>. The first CBT threshold is $208 million.</p>
      <p>That doesn't take into account new contracts for Gregorius and fellow free agent Brett Gardner. While Gregorius' future in the Bronx is still up in the air, the Yankees and Gardner <a href="https://www.mlb.com/yankees/news/brett-gardner-yankees-talking-contract">have opened negotiations</a> on a new contract, a source told MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Gardner, who earned $7.5 million in 2019, may be looking for a raise after posting career highs in homers (28) and OPS (.829).</p>
      <p>Cot's puts the Yankees' 2019 CBT number at $234 million, $28 million over last season's threshold of $206 million, which means the team would be a repeat offender -- and thus, would face a steeper tax rate -- if it exceeds it again in 2020.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, as a CBT payor in 2019, the Yankees will need to forfeit their second- and fifth-highest selections in 2020 Draft as well $1 million from their international bonus pool if they sign any free agent who rejected a <a href="http://m.mlb.com/glossary/transactions/qualifying-offer">qualifying offer</a>. The list of QO players this year includes five of the top starting pitchers: Cole, Stephen Strasburg, Zack Wheeler, Madison Bumgarner and Jake Odorizzi.</p>
      <p>Cashman is highly unlikely to name specific targets the Yankees are planning to pursue, but he might indirectly reveal whether any of those pitchers are realistic options if he sheds some light on the team's luxury-tax stance at the GM Meetings.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Should Dodgers sign Cole and trade for Lindor?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 8:</i> Falling short of a World Series title for the 31st consecutive season, and with the latest attempt ending in the National League Division Series following two straight NL pennants, some feel the Dodgers need to do something drastic to get them over the top in 2020. MLB Network Radio's Jeff Joyce certainly does.</p>
      <p>"I'd get stupid," Joyce said. "Just sign Gerrit Cole and trade for Francisco Lindor. Just do it. ... I looked at this Dodgers team and said before we got to the World Series that I thought the only team that could beat the Astros or the Yankees out of those National League teams was the Nationals, and not the Dodgers, because the Nationals' rotation could nullify those right-handed bats of the Astros.</p>
      <p>"I didn't have any confidence that if the Dodgers got to the World Series against the Astros, that they were going to win. ... Do you want to win the World Series, or do you want to just collect the money at the turn-styles every year, and say, 'Hey, we got to the playoffs 17 straight years,' but Steve Sax is the last one wearing a World Series ring."</p>

        <b>How the competitive balance tax will affect Astros' pursuit</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 8:</i> In this week's <a href="https://www.mlb.com/astros/news/astros-inbox-odds-of-signing-gerrit-cole">Astros Inbox,</a> MLB.com's Brian McTaggart addresses the question of how realistic it would be for the Astros to re-sign Cole. The team has said it will make a run at re-signing the Cy Young finalist, but the competitive balance tax could make it particularly difficult.</p>
      <p>Even without Cole on the books, the Astros will likely be close to the luxury tax threshold next year, which is set at $208 million. Owner Jim Crane said the team could surpass the threshold, but it's unclear how high it would realistically go. Crane also said that the length of the contract could be the toughest part to contend with -- the Astros likely don't want to sign Cole for more than five years, but his initial demand is likely to be longer than that.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stanton: Yanks should get Cole AND Strasburg</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 7:</i> Is there a timeline where the Yankees sign Gerrit Cole <i>and</i> Stephen Strasburg? If New York slugger Giancarlo Stanton had his druthers, both aces would be in pinstripes next season.</p>
      <p>Stanton <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/07/giancarlo-stanton-gerrit-cole-stephen-strasburg-new-york-yankees/">told TMZ Sports</a> that a team "can never go wrong with Cole and Strasburg," adding that the Bronx Bombers "can never have too many" superstars on their roster. It's no secret that the Yankees are looking for an impact starting pitcher to join Luis Severino, James Paxton and Masahiro Tanaka in their rotation, and signing either Cole or Strasburg -- the market's two best free-agent starters -- would qualify as a major splash.</p>
      <p>"I'm pretty sure Gerrit grew up a Yankees fan, so he'd always like to do that," said Stanton. "And, Stras, we debuted together, so he'd like that."</p>
      <p>Stanton and Strasburg both debuted in 2010, though not for the same team of course; they played for division rivals in Miami and Washington. Still, phenoms that come up with other teams are always linked to the Yankees eventually, and Stanton and Strasburg were no different when they took the National League by storm at the beginning of the decade. If Stanton gets his wish, those whispers regarding Strasburg <i>and</i> Cole could come true in the coming months.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sabathia: I've talked to Cole 'at length' about playing in NY</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 6:</i> Eleven years ago, the Yankees made one of the most successful free-agent signings in franchise history, bringing in CC Sabathia on a seven-year, $161 million contract. At the time, the big lefty, a California native, was unsure if he wanted to play in New York, but the Yanks significantly outbid the Angels and everyone else for his services. The recently retired Sabathia thinks the Yankees could do the same with Cole this offseason, even if he has his own reservations about the Big Apple.</p>
      <p>It has been widely assumed that Cole, another California native, wants to play on the West Coast, though he quashed that speculation the day after the World Series ended. "I never said that," the right-hander told the Houston Chronicle.</p>
      <p>Even if Cole does privately have his heart set on a West Coast team, Sabathia thinks the Yankees could sway him with the right offer. He also revealed that the two have spoken on multiple occasions about Sabathia's experience in New York.</p>
      <p>“Me and Gerrit Cole have spoken at length many times about me pitching as a Yankee as a West Coast Guy,” Sabathia <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/05/cc-sabathia-is-all-over-yankees-pursuit-of-gerrit-cole/">said</a> in a preview clip for the "R2C2 is UNINTERRUPTED" podcast. “This is crazy, this is shaping out … like the same offseason I had.</p>
      <p>"If you give [him] enough money, he’s going to want to come here. I am speaking from experience."</p>
      <p>While that may be so, it remains to be seen if the Yankees will go all out to sign Cole. While the team has continued to spend big in recent years, it has shied away from the win-at-all-cost moves that defined the late George Steinbrenner's tenure as owner. Additionally, the Competitive Balance Tax could be a factor in how much New York spends this offseason.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cole tops MLBTR rankings; can he top Price and Greinke?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 5:</i> MLB Trade Rumors published its 14th annual <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2019/11/mlb-free-agent-predictions-2020.html">Top 50 Free Agents list</a> on Tuesday, and Cole is right at the top. MLBTR writer Tim Dierkes states that Cole is a "near-lock" to surpass David Price's record $217 million contract for total value for a free-agent pitcher, while also having a chance to top Zack Greinke's $34.4 million record for average annual value (AAV). Dierkes also predicts the Angels as Cole's landing spot on an eight-year, $256 million contract, which comes out to a $32 million AAV.</p>
      <p>The Angels are far from the only team that figures to be in the Cole sweepstakes; Dierkes identifies the Yankees, Dodgers, Nationals, White Sox, Twins, Phillies, Rangers and Cubs as clubs who could all be in the running.</p>

        <b>Astros owner not ruling out a Cole return</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 4:</i> With Cole now a free agent, it's possible that his final pitch as a member of the Astros came in Game 5 of the World Series against the Nationals.</p>
      <p>The Astros have over $150 million committed to just eight players -- Zack Greinke, Justin Verlander, José Altuve, Michael Brantley, Alex Bregman, Josh Reddick, Ryan Pressly and Yuli Gurriel -- in 2020. Arbitration raises for George Springer, Roberto Osuna and Carlos Correa could add another $30 million or more to the payroll. The trio made $23.5 million combined in 2019, when Houston's payroll was in the $170M range. The first Competitive Balance Tax threshold is set at $208 million next season.</p>
      <p>Houston has never paid the so-called "luxury tax" in the past, but Astros owner Jim Crane isn't ruling out Cole as a target, even if it means exceeding the threshold.</p>
      <p>"It's a possibility," Crane said about paying the tax. "We're going to take a run at [re-signing Cole]. We don't know if we can get where they want to get."</p>

        <b>Cole named AL Cy Young finalist</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 4:</i> The lucky team that signs Cole might well be adding the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner.</p>
      <p>Cole was named <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/2019-bbwaa-awards-finalists">one of the three finalists</a> for the award on Monday, along with rotation-mate Justin Verlander and the Rays' Charlie Morton. The Cy Young Award winner will be announced on Nov. 13.</p>
      <p>Cole looks like the favorite to win the award after taking the AL ERA title (2.50) and striking out a Major League-best 326, the highest single-season strikeout total since Randy Johnson's 334 in 2002.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Is Cole positioned for deal close to $300 million?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 4:</i> It seems like a virtual lock at this point that Cole's next contract will set a record for pitchers, surpassing David Price's $217 million deal with the Red Sox. What's more uncertain is just how much he'll make.</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://theathletic.com/1343614/2019/11/04/bowden-ranking-the-top-35-free-agents-and-predicting-their-contracts-and-best-fits/">article for The Athletic (subscription required)</a> on Monday, former MLB general manager Jim Bowden offered up his prediction, and it's big: eight years for $288 million, which is a $36 million average annual value. That would not only set the pitcher record for total guaranteed money, but also AAV.</p>
      <p>Bowden also lists the best fits for the 29-year-old as the Angels, Yankees, Dodgers and Giants. The first three have been widely mentioned as potential suitors for Cole, but it would be a surprise to see San Francisco enter the mix, as the club doesn't appear to be close to contention. That said, it's possible Giants ownership doesn't want to go through a lengthy rebuild and is willing to shell out big money to bring in Cole as the team's new ace, replacing free agent Madison Bumgarner.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Angels decline Calhoun's option; more money for Cole?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 4:</i> The Angels officially declined right fielder Kole Calhoun's $14 million option on Monday, paying him a $1 million buyout instead and possibly ending his eight-year tenure with the club.</p>
      <p>While this could indicate that outfielder Jo Adell (MLB Pipeline's <a href="http://m.mlb.com/prospects/2019">No. 5 overall</a> prospect) is nearing big league readiness, it's also fair to wonder if the move was made with a Cole pursuit in mind.</p>
      <p>Picking up Calhoun's option would have meant Los Angeles had nearly $130 million committed to just six players -- Mike Trout, Albert Pujols, Justin Upton, Andrelton Simmons, Zack Cozart and Calhoun -- in 2020. Declining it frees up some extra cash for the pitching-starved organization to make a run at Cole, a Southern California native.</p>

        <b>Yankees might need to pay CBT penalties to pay Cole</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>N<a href="https://www.mlb.com/yankees/news/aroldis-chapman-extension-with-yankees">﻿</a>ov. 3:</i> <a href="https://www.mlb.com/yankees/news/aroldis-chapman-extension-with-yankees">Aroldis Chapman's reworked contract</a> keeps the Yankees' payroll situation relatively neutral in comparison to his former deal, but New York's <b><a href="http://m.mlb.com/glossary/transactions/competitive-balance-tax">competitive balance tax</a></b> (CBT) considerations could still affect the Bombers' ability to go after Cole this offseason.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/03/the-luxury-tax-implications-of-aroldis-chapmans-yankees-extension/">Writing for the New York Post on Sunday</a></b>, MLB Network insider Joel Sherman estimates that Chapman's $48 million salary over the next three seasons will cost the Yanks roughly $17.5 million annually toward the CBT payroll. Adding that figure to the Yankees' signed players, arbitration-eligible players and handful of non-arbitration-eligible players that the club needs to sign to fill out the roster, Sherman estimates that New York will be right up against the $208 million threshold for the first CBT penalty (20% tax on all overages for first-time offenders). That means the Yankees would have roughly $20 million to spend before triggering the second CBT penalty (additional 12% surtax), and roughly $40 million before triggering the third and final penalty (42.5% tax).</p>
      <p>The Yankees have been hesitant to cross the CBT threshold in past years (the Red Sox notably did so while assembling their 2018 World Series champion roster), but the pressure to spend might be heightened in the Bronx after New York <b><a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/yankees-no-world-series-appearance-2010s-decade">finished the 2010s without a single American League pennant</a></b>. They have internal decisions to make on whether to extend the one-year, $17.8 million qualifying offer to shortstop Didi Gregorius, and whether to re-sign reliever Dellin Betances, who tore his left Achilles tendon in September.</p>
      <p>Cole is expected to sign a record contract for a free-agent starter, which could require the Yankees to surpass their previous CBT comfort level.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who will get the top contract this offseason: Cole or Rendon?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 2:</i> Much like last offseason, when Bryce Harper and Manny Machado battled for free-agent supremacy, there's no consensus on the top player available this year. On one side, there's Cole. On the other, there's third baseman Anthony Rendon.</p>
      <p>Both players are 29 years old and have a strong case for the No. 1 spot. Position players arguably are a safer commodity than pitchers, but aces of Cole's caliber might be more difficult to come by. Cole had a 2.50 ERA with 326 strikeouts in 212 1/3 innings this past season, and he went on to record a 1.72 ERA with 47 K's in 36 2/3 innings during the postseason. Rendon, meanwhile, hit .319/.412/.598 with 34 homers and 126 RBIs over 146 games in the regular season and .328/.413/.590 with three homers and 15 RBIs in 17 playoff games, helping the Nats top Cole's Astros in the World Series. In the past two years, Cole produced 13.4 FanGraphs' Wins Above Replacement. Rendon was worth 13.2 in that same span.</p>
      <p>In MLB.com reporter Anthony Castrovince's view, Cole is No. 1, and Rendon No. 2, on <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/ranking-top-2020-mlb-free-agents">the list of the top 20 free agents</a>. However, that doesn't necessarily mean Cole will get a larger contract. The right-hander is expected to surpass David Price's record $217 million deal for the largest ever signed by a pitcher. He may even eclipse $250 million. Rendon, though, reportedly already had a $210 to $215 million offer in hand from the Nationals, and he turned it down. Rendon's agent, Scott Boras, who also represents Cole, could look to third baseman Nolan Arenado's eight-year, $268 million pact with the Rockies as a starting point for Rendon's new contract, considering Rendon compares favorably to the Colorado slugger.</p>

        <b>Cole on preferring to play for West Coast team: 'I never said that'</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 1:</i> Cole, who said after the Astros' Game 7 loss to the Nationals on Wednesday night that he was "not an employee of the team" and that he would be representing himself as he spoke to the media, backtracked on those comments Thursday, saying they were made out of frustration and disappointment after the heartbreaking defeat.</p>
      <p>“I was upset, and my tone did not come off quite the way I wanted it to,” <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/texas-sports-nation/astros/article/Astros-Gerrit-Cole-I-don-t-have-a-crystal-ball-14701325.php">Cole told the Houston Chronicle</a>. “One win away. We had the lead with eight outs to go. It’s just a tough pill to swallow.”</p>
      <p>Cole also refuted the assumption that he would prefer to play for a team close to his Southern California roots. That speculation began gaining steam when Astros outfielder Josh Reddick weighed in on the situation before the American League Championship Series, saying Cole “probably wants to be closer to home" and predicting that his free-agent destination was "definitely going to be west of Nevada.”</p>
      <p>“No, that’s not a fair assumption,” Cole said Thursday. “I never said that.”</p>
      <p>Granted, it works to agent Scott Boras' advantage to have as many teams in the mix as possible, so it's not surprising that Cole isn't publicly crossing anyone off the list, especially with the deep-pocketed Yankees and Phillies expected to be involved.</p>
      <p>Cole hasn't closed the book on a return to Houston, either, though he admitted that the situation is out of his hands.</p>
      <p>“I’m really grateful for this experience. I’ve loved every minute of it. I'm not saying goodbye, by any means. I truthfully don’t have a crystal ball. I could speak to what I know. And I know that I've loved every second here and I loved competing with the guys.</p>
      <p>“The rest isn’t up to me,” he added. “I don’t know what they're going to do. I don’t have control over the situation.”</p>
      <p>Cole was tremendous for Houston in October, posting a 1.72 ERA and 34 percent strikeout rate over five starts, but he did not appear in World Series Game 7.</p>
      <p>Heading into free agency, Cole is coming off a season in which he led the AL with a 2.50 ERA and the Majors with 326 strikeouts. Going into his age-29 season with the credentials he has, which include three All-Star selections and two top-five finishes in Cy Young Award voting, he may set a record for pitchers in terms of overall contract value and average annual value.</p>
