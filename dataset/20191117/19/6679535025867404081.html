      <p>The Chennai Corporation has started selling manure at malls and shopping complexes. The civic body will also supply manure on the doorstep of residents who place orders through WhatsApp.</p>
      <p>The Corporation has commissioned micro-composting centres at all the 200 wards, generating manure from at least 500 tonnes of vegetable waste generated in the city.</p>
      <p>Chennai Corporation Deputy Commissioner (South) Alby John Varghese on Sunday, in his tweet, said: “We started selling manure from our micro compost centres in malls and shopping complexes in the city.” He said a sales counter had been set up at Phoenix Mall, Velachery.</p>
      <p>The civic body has sold 9,910 kg of manure by getting orders through WhatsApp. “We are getting good response for the sales,” said an official of the Corporation.</p>
      <p>“Residents can order through WhatsApp number 9445194802. We do door delivery within the Chennai Corporation limits,” said Mr.Varghese.</p>
      <p>Owing to demand from residents in suburban areas such as Chromepet, Tambaram and Poonamallee, the civic body is planning to use the services of vendor platforms such as Amazon and Flipkart for supplying the manure. “We are thinking of using vendor platforms like Amazon and Flipkart. So, maybe soon,” said Mr.Varghese.</p>
      <p>The Corporation sells manure at ₹20 a kg. The initiative is part of its zero waste project. The civic body plans to stop the dumping of waste at Perungudi and Kodungaiyur by December 2020. The city generates 5,000 tonnes of municipal solid waste a day.</p>
      <p>Most of its 700 parks have facilities to compost vegetable waste from the neighbourhood.</p>
