      <p>East Delhi’s congested Krishna Nagar Market may soon witness on-street parking charges with the civic body planning to tender out the parking here to a private concessionaire, a senior official said.</p>
      <p>The market is one of three sites in the city where the Environment Pollution (Prevention &amp; Control) Authority (EPCA) has instructed the civic body to carry out pilot parking projects that may be replicated in other areas.</p>
      <p>The EDMC had in the second week of October carried out a temporary pedestrianisation of the market, with multiple roads blocked for vehicles. The pilot project involved the deployment of several traffic policemen and municipal staff to keep a check on traffic movement and illegal parking.</p>
      <p>Nodal officer in-charge, Assistant Commissioner Aman Rajput, said that the private contractor would be in-charge of various aspects such as barricading and security apart from which it would also turn parking here into a source of revenue.</p>
      <p>The EDMC will soon issue a short-period tender for the same and hopes to have the system along with pedestrianised stretches in place by the first week of December, the official said.</p>
      <p>Parking in the area is currently free, but as per the new parking policy by the Delhi government, Mr. Rajput pointed out, on-street parking is not permitted.</p>
