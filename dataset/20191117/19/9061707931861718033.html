      <p>Burton roads are set to be hit by a number of sets of roadworks within the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>Many well-used roads in the town will be impacted, including Derby Road, Branston Road, Evershed Way and Shobnall Road as work is carried out and the temporary lights will be in place.</p>
      <p>Drivers are <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/traffic-and-travel">being warned to make a note</a> of where they will be as they are about to be rolled out on roads in their area as they will impact their commute to and from work.</p>
      <p>Nothing can quite ruin a good mood in the morning like the sudden appearance of roadworks when you are not expecting it.</p>
      <p>All of the following cases of roadworks will happen within the next two weeks, according to <a href="https://one.network/">monitoring website one.network</a> .</p>
      <p>We have done the hard work for you and collected a list of all the roadworks coming up from now until Friday, November 29.</p>
