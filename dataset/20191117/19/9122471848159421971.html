      <p>Tua Tagovailoa suffered one of the scariest injuries a player can suffer yesterday. He dislocated his hip in a manner that ended the football career of the great Bo Jackson.</p>
      <p>But as heartbreaking as it was to see their leader go down, the Alabama players have made it clear how much they care about him.</p>
      <p>On Sunday morning, Alabama defensive lineman Phidarian Mathis shared a photo of himself and teammate Raekwon Davis visiting Tagovailoa in the hospital.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa, from his hospital bed, looked to be in good spirits and happy to see his teammates.</p>

      <p>Tagovailoa was injured late in the second quarter of the Tide’s game against Mississippi State. Head coach Nick Saban has taken a ton of heat <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/kirk-herbstreit-reacts-nick-saban-playing-tua-tagovailoa">for letting his Heisman-caliber quarterback stay in the game</a> with a 38-7 lead.</p>
      <p>Alabama will now be forced to make their College Football Playoff push with backup Mac Jones. They’ll have a laugher against Western Carolina next week before the crucial Iron Bowl game against Auburn.</p>
      <p>If nothing else, it seems clear that Alabama will be dedicating the rest of the season to Tua’s quick recovery.</p>
      <p>Get well soon Tua!</p>
