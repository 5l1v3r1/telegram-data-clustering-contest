        <b>RATINGS:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Ronwen Williams: 5/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Didn't have much to do between the sticks on the day.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Thapelo Morena: 7/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Morena was drafted to the right full-back position and he did not disappoint, especially going forward as he pace caused a lot of problems down the right flank.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sifiso Hlanti: 5/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Similarly to Morena, he did push forward on a few occasions, although his final ball was not at its usual standard on the day.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Erick Mathoho: 6/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mathoho made a few interceptions whenever Sudan embarked on a counter-attack and was always comfortable in possession of the ball.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Thulani Hlatshwayo: 6/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Bafana defence did not have much deal with on the day, but Hlatshwayo, like Mathoho, was alert to any danger on the counter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kamohelo Mokotjo: 6.5/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Restored to the line-up after missing out on Thursday, Mokotjo dictated play from the onset and had a good understanding with the fellow attackers, which was evident in the link-up play.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dean Furman: 6/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Was a little guilty of giving possession away on a couple occasions in the first half, but it was another consistent showing from the SuperSport United midfielder overall.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lebogang Phiri: 7/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>The French-based midfielder certainly gave a good account of himself in a rare start for Bafana. He linked up well with the other attackers and netted an impressive goal in the first half.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Percy Tau: 6.5/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Much more livelier than he was on Thursday evening and was real nuisance to the Sudan right-back. Tau's link-up play with Phiri and Serero was impressive to watch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Thulani Serero: 6.5/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Serero was lively in the Bafana attack from the onset and was involved in a couple good attacking moves in the opening 45 minutes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lebogang Mothiba: 5/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Replaced Grobler at the summit of the attack, but looked down on confidence after squandering two good chances in the first half. He was replaced just after the hour mark.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Substitutions:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Lebohang Manyama: 4/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Replaced Phiri for the final 20 minutes, but didn't too much in the final third.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kermit Erasmus: 4/10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Had a couple good sights at goal in his second-half cameo, but was denied by Sudan goalkeeper Ali Aboeshren.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bradley Grobler: NA</b>
      </p>
      <p>Only played 15 minutes of the second half, but he did have a goal disallowed for offside in the final five minutes.</p>
