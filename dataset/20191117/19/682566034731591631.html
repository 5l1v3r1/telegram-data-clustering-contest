      <p>London - <b>Pierre-Hugues Herbert</b> and <b>Nicolas Mahut</b> won the <b>ATP Finals doubles title</b> on Sunday - a year after coming within a point of lifting the trophy.</p>
      <p>The French seventh seeds beat fifth seeds <b>Raven Klaasen</b> of South Africa and New Zealand's <b>Michael Venus 6-3, 6-4</b> at London's O2 Arena.</p>
      <p>They notched their ninth straight victory to lift the trophy after 70 minutes, saving all four break points they faced.</p>
      <p>Mahut and Herbert have won all 18 sets they have contested since arriving at the Paris Masters last month.</p>
      <p>The career Grand Slam winners are the first team to lift the trophy at the O2 without dropping a set since Jean-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecau in 2015.</p>
      <p>The ATP Finals crown is their 15th tour-level trophy as a team, adding to 2019 titles at the Australian Open and Paris Masters.</p>
      <p>With their Australian Open trophy in January, Herbert and Mahut became only the eighth men's doubles team to complete the career Grand Slam.</p>
