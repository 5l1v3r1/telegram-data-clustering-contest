        <b>After deciding to retire from MotoGP it is party time for Jorge Lorenzo, who will take time to relax before deciding what to do next</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jorge Lorenzo will take time to travel and “party” before deciding on his next career move after calling time on his competitive MotoGP career.</p>
      <p>The Spanish great announced the season-ending Valencia Grand Prix would be his last race and he finished 13th in front of his home fans on Sunday.</p>
      <p>It has been a disappointing final campaign for the three-time MotoGP champion, who has struggled with injuries and form after switching to Repsol Honda.</p>
      <p>Lorenzo is open to the possibility of taking on a position as a test rider in the future but for now he plans to unwind after a brilliant career.</p>
      <p>Speaking to BT Sport, he said: “Now I can breathe, now I can relax!</p>
      <p>“It’s a big relief to finish my career without a crash, I didn’t feel great on the bike with the wind and the cold and when I knew I couldn’t have the pace this weekend, when I understand I can’t be quicker, I just tried to finish without crashing.</p>
      <p>“I spent my life travelling, sacrificing, training, feeling pressure to get results, I have many, many beautiful moments but also hard moments and a lot of discipline during my life.</p>
      <p>“Now I just want to go on holiday. I will see what happens in a month, two months of holiday then when I’m home plan my next chapter.</p>
      <p>“Life is very open, there are many things to do. I love obviously to travel, to eat, to sleep, to party, just enjoy life. There is only one life, I’m just here to enjoy it.</p>
      <p>“As I told you there are a lot of things in life, I’m open to any possibility, that [test riding] could be a possibility but I’m not close to that.”</p>

      <p>Lorenzo has many fond memories on the bike but counts the 2015 title win when he pipped Valentino Rossi to glory as his greatest achievement.</p>
      <p>“Obviously, 2010 [was special] because I made a record of points, it was almost the perfect season,” he added.</p>
      <p>“Apart from this I will remark 2015 because there was a lot of pressure. Valentino had to finish fourth, it happened, I won by three points.”</p>
      <p>Team-mate and compatriot Marc Marquez – who rounded off another memorable title-winning campaign with victory in Valencia – paid tribute to Lorenzo.</p>
      <p>“I mean what we saw this year from Jorge is not the reality, of course [he will be] disappointed with the way he finished his career,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t have in my mind this Jorge. Jorge is the one that was winning, a strong character, strong riding style.</p>
      <p>“I say all the best to him and for me he is one of the references in MotoGP and one of the references for the young kids.”</p>
