      <h1>Blizzard Confirms Microtransactions for 'Diablo 4'</h1>
      <h2>Apparently only for cosmetic items.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T03:55:40+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 03:55</time> by <a rel="author">Jeff Yeung</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/diablo-4"><i>Diablo 4</i></a> immediately became a huge hit among fans of the franchise when <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/blizzard">Blizzard</a> announced it earlier this month during BlizzCon, but it now seems there’s a bit of a hiccup — the game developer has now confirmed that microtransactions will play a role in the upcoming action RPG.</p>
      <p>The news first broke when the California-based game developer spoke to Twitch streamer Quin69. Confirming that there’ll be additional expansions on the way post-launch, Blizzard also said that the game will feature a wide array of cosmetic items, some of which can only be acquired by players through microtransactions. While this type of pricing model is not uncommon for cosmetics in other free-to-play games, <i>Diablo 4</i> will be a premium game which may typically cost upward of $60 USD, and learning that even after paying for the game, certain items are still locked behind more payments obviously does not sit well with fans. As Twitter user Stadium said: “[<i>Diablo 4</i>] is being built from the ground up to entice you to spend more money than the $60 you pay up front for it.”</p>
      <p>Whether this new revelation will put you off the game or not, let us know in the comments down below.</p>
