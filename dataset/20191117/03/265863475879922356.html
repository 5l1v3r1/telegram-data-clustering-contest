      <h1>Jon Gosselin Says His Former Wife Kate Has Narcissistic Personality Disorder</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T03:34:46+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 03:34</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>During his interview on The Dr. Oz Show, Jon Gosselin opened up about his former wife, Kate and their rocky past together, even going as far as to say that she is a narcissist! The former Jon and Kate Plus 8 star is able to talk about it all now that the ten-tear-long gag order has been lifted and he really held nothing back!</p>
      <p>While all of his claims were at least interesting, the most shocking was that Kate supposedly suffers from Narcissistic Personality Disorder which also means that she cares very little about others.</p>
      <p>The revelation came when he was asked if he thought their marriage would have survived without the reality TV show documenting their lives.</p>
      <p>In response to that, Jon stated that ‘I think eventually, because of personality, it would have fizzled out anyway, because we, first of all, I got married at 22 years old, you just don’t know. think it’s both of us, but I think she has a narcissistic personality disorder. I think she tends to think more on her level selfishly instead for others.’</p>
      <p>When it comes to his personality type however, Jon argued that he’s pretty much the opposite of Kate and that might have contributed to their relationship ending as well.</p>
      <p>‘I think I tend to think sometimes more for others than for myself, so I tend to not worry what’s going on with me when I should sometimes,’ he told the host.</p>
      <p>The two were married for about ten years before their divorce in 2009.</p>
