      <p>After 12 years of existence, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/maserati">Maserati</a> is closing the chapter on the current iteration of its renowned <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/maserati-granturismo">GranTurismo</a>. The Italian luxury automaker is planning on beginning a “new era” in the next couple of years, as it intends to produce a fully-electric, zero-emissions successor to the aforementioned ride — which will reportedly be a “sports car based on the Alfieri concept.” To commemorate this transition and prepare consumers for what’s next, Maserati is introducing the GranTurismo Zeda, a striking one-off creation that serves as the final piece of that style’s history. According to Maserati, the Zeda is presently the lone physical presentation of that brand’s “past, present and future.”</p>
      <p>With the current take on the GranTurismo no longer being assembled, the car’s Modena-based plant is also undergoing a revamping, while the forthcoming iterations of the GranTurismo and GranCabrio will be brought to life at Maserati’s Turin facility. Throughout the past 12 years, over 40,000 GranTurismo and GranCabrio vehicles have been sold.</p>
      <p>You can take a look at the Maserati GranTurismo Zeda above, and stay tuned for more information concerning the future of Maserati’s lineup of luxury vehicles and the GranTurismo’s all-electric successor.</p>
