      <h1>Thieves steal reader’s identity using USPS mail forwarding scam</h1>

        <b>Dear John: What you wrote about forwarding post office mail was not true for us. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Someone filed a “forwarding address” for our mail, and it was forwarded to a Philadelphia post office address. We live in Florida. They were able to get a password from USPS. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>We couldn’t stop the forwarding because we would need the PIN the post office emailed to the thieves. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>We received no notification from USPS. Besides, if we did, it would have been forwarded to the bogus address anyway. The thieves got a checking account statement and ordered new checks sent to their address. They applied for credit cards and other charge accounts. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>USPS locally was helpful, but the inspector general’s office in Washington, DC, was useless. It had zero interest in investigating, let alone prosecuting. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>We, too, were told we couldn’t flag our address to avoid a repeat of this activity. Anyone can file a forwarding order online and you won’t know it until you notice you are not getting mail. F.J. </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Dear F.J.:</b> Sorry to hear about your troubles.</p>
      <p>So, someone at the post office was either careless or was in on the scheme.</p>
      <p>Now everyone is warned. What the post office thinks is going on — and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/02/who-changed-my-address-at-the-post-office/">what I put in the Nov. 3 issue</a> of The Post — isn’t necessarily so.</p>
      <p>Watch your mail carefully. If you stop getting anything, that’s a sure sign — junk mail never ceases.</p>
