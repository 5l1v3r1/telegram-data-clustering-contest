        <b>Star centre-back and Senegal international Kalidou Koulibaly said he is happy in Naples.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kalidou Koulibaly reaffirmed his affection for Napoli amid ongoing links to Premier League giants Manchester United.</p>
      <p>United continue to be linked with a move for highly rated Napoli defender Koulibaly, despite the world-record signing of Harry Maguire at the start of the season.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are reportedly keen to bolster their backline, which has been problematic in recent seasons, even after the arrivals of Victor Lindelof and Eric Bailly.</p>
      <p>However, star centre-back and Senegal international Koulibaly said he is happy in Naples.</p>

      <p>“This is where my children were born,” Koulibaly wrote via Twitter. “This is where I grew up as a man and a player.</p>
      <p>“This is where my family and I feel at home #Napoli.”</p>
      <p>Koulibaly has established himself as one of the world’s best defenders since swapping Genk for Napoli in 2014.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old has made 10 Serie A appearances this season and 14 across all competitions for Carlo Ancelotti’s Napoli.</p>
