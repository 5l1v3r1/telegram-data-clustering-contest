      <h1>Big K.R.I.T. Continues His "My Sub" Series on "Ballad Of The Bass (My Sub V)"</h1>
      <h2>K.R.I.T. isn’t slowing down anytime soon.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T03:57:45+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 03:57</time> by <a rel="author">Patrick Montes</a></address>
      <p>Towards the end of last month, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/big-k-r-i-t">Big K.R.I.T.</a> supported his July album <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/7/big-krit-krit-iz-here-album-stream">K.R.I.T. IZ HERE</a> by sharing the music video for its finale, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/big-krit-mississippi-music-video-stream">“M.I.S.S.I.S.S.I.P.P.I.”</a> Now, showing no signs of slowing down, K.R.I.T. is back with his first new, original solo cut since the release of the aforementioned LP. Titled “Ballad of the Bass (My Sub V),” the down-south lyricist’s latest release serves as the fifth and newest entry in his ongoing “My Sub” series, which has been running strong since the self-produced inaugural record — which was included on the tracklist of K.R.I.T.’s critically-acclaimed, fan-favorite seventh mixtape <i>Return of 4Eva</i> — debuted in 2011. “Ballad of the Bass” comes to us two years after the release of the previous “My Sub” record, “Subenstein.”</p>
      <p>“Whether I sell a million now or a million 15 years from now, it’s still going to equate to the worth that it deserves,” Big K.R.I.T. shared with us during a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/9/big-krit-interview-micline-episode-41">September episode</a> of our <i>MIC/LINE</i> podcast. “We get so caught up in that first week sale and everything else doesn’t matter when it’s supposed to. Maybe you heard it, and you weren’t in the right space to digest what I was saying. It might take you ten years, and you finally get it. You’re not going to immediately get it— finding the patience to digest, pay attention and observe what somebody had to go through to create that.”</p>
