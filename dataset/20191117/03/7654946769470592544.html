      <p>Drivers can now access the car of their dreams on a short-term subscription basis. But should they?</p>
      <p>With the average cost of buying and owning a car climbing to a record $773 a month in 2019, according to AAA — and some folks opting for crazy 84-month financing, according to Experian — car subscriptions, an alternative to leasing or buying, are now in the mix.</p>
      <p>The ideal customer is someone with a little more than average disposable income who doesn’t want to be tied down with a lease contract and likes the ability to frequently swap cars, said Ronald Montoya, senior consumer advice editor at the research site Edmunds.com.</p>
      <p>That freedom appealed to Ben Schwartz, 22, of Brooklyn, who opted for a Cadillac Escalade in the Book by Cadillac program, which has since been put on hiatus. Schwartz said he got the $500 signup fee waived and paid $1,800 a month.</p>
      <p>“No commitment, that’s the biggest thing,” he said of the arrangement, adding that it was a platinum-trim $100,000 vehicle. “Only, I wasn’t in need of a big SUV, so a year after, I canceled.”</p>
      <p>A reboot of Book by Cadillac is reportedly in the works. Cadillac declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Care by Volvo, which operates in New Jersey and Connecticut, hopes to make its subscription service available in New York state soon, said spokesman Russell Datz.</p>
      <p>The program “simplifies car ownership for qualified buyers with a single monthly cost that covers car payment, insurance, scheduled maintenance, and some wear and tear,” Datz said.</p>
      <p>After 12 months, subscribers can upgrade to a new vehicle. Cars range from $700 a month for a 2020 XC40 to $800 a month for a 2020 XC90.</p>
      <p>Proponents expect there will be an appetite for more and varied subscription options as consumers try to get out from under traditional loans or leases.</p>
      <p>John Masano, president of Tom Masano Auto Group in Reading, Pennsylvania, introduced REV by Masano in June as an “affordable” way for members to drive one of its cars with no long-term commitment.</p>
      <p>“Looking at the youth coming into the market, they want flexibility and convenience,” Masano said.</p>
      <p>REV is a month-to-month membership that can be canceled at any time. Insurance, maintenance, cleaning, taxes and concierge service are included, and monthly prices range from $450 to $650.</p>
      <p>Car subscriptions require some math, said Montoya of Edmunds, which did a primer on them in January.</p>
      <p>“The key is to evaluate for yourself, price it out, call your insurance company, get a price quote,” Montoya said. “Go to a regular dealer or email them and ask them to send a lease quote.”</p>
