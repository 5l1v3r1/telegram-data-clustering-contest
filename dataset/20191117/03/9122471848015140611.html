      <h1>Eric Reid Responds To Comments By Stephen A. Smith After Colin Kaepernick’s Workout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T03:29:15+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 03:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>If you expected today’s NFL-backed Colin Kaepernick workout to go off without a hitch, you were very mistaken. Hours before he was set to throw in front of teams and answer questions, the former Super Bowl quarterback abruptly <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/colin-kaepernick-workout-being-moved-location">changed the location</a>, from the Atlanta Falcons’ facility to a local high school.</p>
      <p>The NFL was <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/nfl-statement-after-colin-kaepernick-changes-workout">not happy about the move</a>, as it made clear in a long statement. Plenty of media showed up to the new location, but the change appeared to cut down on the number of teams represented, though that exact list is unknown as of now.</p>
      <p>It appeared that Kaepernick wanted to take more control over the process, which was rushed along by the NFL. He initially wanted to hold the workout on a Tuesday, which is when most similar workouts are done for maximum exposure to league personnel. The NFL refused, mandating that it happen today, opposite a number of big college football games, including nearby Auburn vs. Georgia.</p>
      <p>The workout itself reportedly went well, with one team representative saying that <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/colin-kaepernick-workout-results-feedback-elite-arm">Colin Kaepernick still has “elite arm talent,”</a> and looks like the player we remember from the league. After the event, he said that NFL owners should <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/colin-kaepernick-tells-nfl-owners-to-stop-being-scared">“stop being scared”</a> and made it clear that he would sign with any team.</p>
      <p>Not everyone was impressed with how things went down today. ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/stephen-a-smith-blasts-colin-kaepernick-workout">ripped into Kaepernick</a>, saying that today proved that he doesn’t actually want to be signed, and would rather be a “martyr.”</p>
      <p>Carolina Panthers’ defensive back Eric Reid, who was one of the more notable players to protest alongside Kaepernick during his last stint in the league, was on hand for the workout. He took to Twitter to respond to Stephen A., and did not hold back.</p>

      <p>The NFL said that the conditions that Kaepernick’s workout were going to be standard, that the waiver that has become a bone of contention was not out of the ordinary, and has made it seem as if it was acquiescing to many of the quarterback’s requests.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick and his camp say that the NFL’s conditions didn’t allow for the level of transparency he wanted, and as Reid notes there, he has good reason to not trust the league itself, even as he works to get back into it.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, people are going to probably feel the way that they already felt about this whole situation, after what was apparently an impressive if fraught event for the former San Francisco 49er. It remains anyone’s guess if this will kickstart his eventual return to the league.</p>
