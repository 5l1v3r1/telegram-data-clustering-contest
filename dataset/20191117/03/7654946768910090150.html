      <p>Who needs beef, chicken or pork?</p>
      <p>That’s what an increasing number of Americans are saying. And companies have noticed, as they offer a range of meat alternatives.</p>
      <p>“Interest is booming in plant-based meat analogues and lab-grown meat alternatives,” according to PreScouter, a research firm, in <a href="https://www.prescouter.com/inquiry/meat-alternatives-2019/">its report Meat Alternatives 2019</a>.</p>
      <p>Besides potentially big profits, alternative meat advocates say these products are better for the environment.</p>
      <p>Variations include plants such as soybeans, tofu, mushrooms, lentils and several fruits. They can replace meat in ground beef, sausages and bacon strips, among other foods.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan Chase says the market for plant-based meat alternatives could top $100 billion in 15 years. Barclays, in <a href="https://www.investmentbank.barclays.com/our-insights/carving-up-the-alternative-meat-market.html">its Carving Up the Alternative Meat Market report</a>, also predicts the potential for alternatives is huge.</p>
      <p>In part, new veggie products are popular because of their promise to reduce greenhouse gases. Alternative meat advocates argue these products might even persuade some to switch from traditional meats.</p>
      <p>Animal agriculture is responsible for approximately 18% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions globally, according to the PreScouter report.</p>
      <p>“One way to ﬁght these environmental issues is to stop or reduce consuming meat,” the PreScouter report says.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Barclays sees opportunity there. “Due to rising demand and a growing population, global meat consumption is on the rise, especially in the US,” Barclays wrote. “We believe therefore that there is a bigger market opportunity for plant-based (and maybe even lab-grown) protein than was projected for electric vehicles 10 years ago.”</p>
      <p>Barclays says that today, alternative meats are $1.4 billion, or 1%, of the global meat industry. By 2029, it predicts alternatives will be $140 billion, or 10%.</p>
      <p>PreScouter lists dozens of companies working with fast-food chains such as McDonald’s, KFC and Burger King.</p>
      <p>Burger King recently launched the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/01/burger-king-is-taking-the-impossible-whopper-nationwide/">vegetarian Impossible Whopper</a>. It has “become one of the most successful product launches in brand history, leading to outstanding comparable sales of positive 5% this past quarter,” a BK spokeswoman said. It is being tested in 180 American and 20 European markets.</p>
