      <p><b>Readers: </b>Here is the fifth winner of Lively hearing aids. Two more to go. And then maybe a surprise. — John</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dear John:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>My name is Levi, and I’m the proud 25-year-old dad of a beautiful 5-month-old.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Unfortunately, hearing loss runs in my family, and my daughter needed a new pair of hearing aids, which, of course, aren’t covered by insurance.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>This really set us back because I was hoping to get hearing aids for myself, as I also have hearing loss. I haven’t gotten a new pair since I was 18.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>We have just never been able to scrape up enough money for them. I’ve applied for a number of different grants, but have been denied due to being slightly over the maximum income.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Getting a new set of hearing aids for myself would make a world of difference in my life, from being able to interact with my daughter to being more aware and adept at work. I appreciate your work, consideration and time spent reading this. Levi</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Dear Levi:</b> I’m glad that you were picked to get a pair of Lively (listenlively.com) hearing aids.</p>
      <p>Now you can hear the baby crying at night. No more excuses for not getting up!</p>
      <p>Wear them well.</p>
