        <b>Dear John: The following situation is a bit concerning to me.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Our neighbors, who are immigrants, hang the American flag outside their home. But it is tattered and upside down. How do I approach these neighbors and tell them they are disrespecting our flag, especially on Veterans Day?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Not putting a flag out is preferable to hanging our flag in a disrespectful way.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>They have been in the neighborhood a few years and do not speak English. Thanks for your advice. Anonymous</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Dear Anonymous:</b> I was really touched by your letter. And not just because it was Veterans Day.</p>
      <p>But I was afraid you were getting in over your head because these were neighbors. And what if they were flying the flag that way to send a political message?</p>
      <p>So when you asked me for advice, this is what I said: have someone else do it. Specifically, contact your local VFW Post and have someone there approach your neighbors.</p>
      <p>That still could get you in a jam. So I called the VFW Post.</p>
      <p>The folks there were understandably busy on Veterans Day, but a few days later one of them — Joe — went to the offending house and left a note.</p>
      <p>Soon afterward, the flag was taken down.</p>
      <p>You and Joe are patriots!</p>
      <p>I can’t help but recall one of the most touching moments I remember in sports. That was on April 25, 1976, at LA’s Dodger Stadium, when protesters tried to burn an American flag in left-center field.</p>
      <p>Chicago Cubs outfielder Rick Monday ran over and snatched the flag before it had been ignited. When Monday came to bat in the top of the fifth inning, there was a message on the scoreboard that said, “Rick Monday … You Made A Great Play.”</p>
      <p>I don’t have a big scoreboard. But I do have a column. And what you did was admirable.</p>
      <p>The VFW and the neighbor both were thinking about buying the family a new flag, as often happens in cases like this.</p>
      <p>But the VFW decided against it. “I’m not interested in them having a flag,” said Joe, “because they don’t know how to take care of it.”</p>
