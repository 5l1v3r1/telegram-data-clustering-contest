      <p>Samsung Galaxy A51 Korean certification reveals a 4000mAh battery<br/>3.7 (73.33%) 15 votes</p>
      <p>For a while now, the Samsung Galaxy A51 has been subjects of many leaks, and reports. The device is tipped to arrive soon, perhaps as the first in the Galaxy A series lineup for 2020. A leaked render of the A51 surfaced a few days ago, and while that wasn’t enough of justifications, the device, days after day appeared officially on <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/15/support-page-for-galaxy-a51-appears/">Samsung’s official website with a support page.</a></p>
      <p>The page doesn’t list any technical specs, and now, the device has now surfaced again on a certification database, but this time in Korea. The device now has the <a href="https://www.dealntech.com/samsung-galaxy-a51-may-come-4000-mah-battery/">nodding</a> of the South Korean government’s research institute for sale in the country,  and as per the certification document, the A51 will indeed come packed with 4,000 mAh cell which is the same size as the Galaxy A50 and A50s’ batteries.</p>
      <p>Officially, Samsung has yet to release any official teaser, so we do not have any official details about the device. However, reports, and leaked renders have it that the Samsung Galaxy A51  has a 6.5-inch display with FHD+ resolution and a punch-hole for the selfie camera. It’s a single 32MP selfie snapper that will be placed in the middle, similar to the Galaxy Note 10 placement.</p>
      <p>On the back, we expect to see an<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/05/the-samsung-galaxy-a51-would-have-a-quad-camera-of-48mp/"> L-shaped Quad-Camera setup comprising</a> a 48MP main sensor, 12MP Ultra-Wide, 12MP Telephone, and 5MP depth sensor modules. The device is tipped to be powered by an Exynos 9611 SoC paired with 4GB of RAM as revealed by its <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/22/samsung-galaxy-a51-appears-on-geekbench-with-android-10/">Geekbench listing</a>, and probably 128GB of Storage. The listing also reveals it will run Android 10 straight out the box with One UI 2.0 running atop.</p>
      <h3>Galaxy a51 launch date</h3>
      <p>We are not sure when the Samsung Galaxy A51 will become official as Samsung has yet to scheduled a launch event. However, we expect it to arrive soon, since it already cleared major pre-release hurdles, both home and abroad.</p>
