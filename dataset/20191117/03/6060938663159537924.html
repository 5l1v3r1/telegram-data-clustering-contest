      <p>He was part of the Czech team that won back-to-back <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Davis-Cup">Davis Cup</a> titles in 2012 and 2013.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old Berdych, who has not played since losing in the first round of the U.S. Open in August, announced his decision at the ATP Finals.</p>
      <p>Berdych said it was his defeat by qualifier Jenson Brooksby in New York that convinced him it was time to quit.</p>
      <p>"I don't know exactly the day and date, but it was very soon or very quickly after the U.S. Open this year, because really, just the feeling that I went through on my last official match, it's been just one that told me, that's it," he said.</p>
      <p>"You tried absolutely everything and the result is how it is. I was always chasing the top results and being in the top positions, and then you are almost really fighting for the first match to win, really like badly, fighting with yourself."</p>
