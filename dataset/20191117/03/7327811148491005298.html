      <p>COLORADO -- Firefighters helped a curious critter escape from a very sticky situation earlier this week in Colorado.</p>
      <p>A fire rescue team came across a raccoon in Roxborough, stranded in a tree with his face stuck in an empty jar of peanut butter.</p>
      <p>The crew tweeted video of the distraught animal, as he clung to branches with one paw and tried to remove the stubborn jar with the other.</p>
      <p>The video has more than 12,000 views on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Eventually, the crew was able to get the raccoon down and free him from the container.</p>
      <p>They even tweeted a cute follow-up picture, to let everyone know he was safe and sound.</p>
