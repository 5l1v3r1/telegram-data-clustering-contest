      <p>SAN FRANCISCO, California: Ever-expanding Google becomes a gaming company Tuesday with the launch of its Stadia cloud service that lets people play console-quality video games on a web browser or smartphone.<br/>The Internet giant hopes to break into the global video game industry expected to top $150 billion this year, with cloud technology that could broaden audiences attracted by rich new features as well as ease of access with no more need for consoles.<br/>But analysts say Stadia’s outlook is uncertain as its faces rivals such as PlayStation Now in an emerging and highly-competitive market.<br/>Stadia plays into a trend in which content — ranging from blockbuster films to work projects — lives in the cloud and is accessible from any device.<br/>“All of these new services are merely pointing out that we don’t need sophisticated hardware in the home to access entertainment,” said Wedbush Securities equity research managing director Michael Pachter.<br/>Google last month sold out of “Founder’s Edition” kits, which are priced at $129.<br/>Each kit contains a Stadia controller and a pendant-shaped Chromecast Ultra wireless connection device that plugs into television sets.<br/>Stadia games are playable using Google Chrome web browser software on computers.<br/>It also works with Google-made Pixel smartphones from the second-generation onward, and on televisions.<br/>Stadia Pro subscriptions, priced at $10 a month in the US, will be available in 14 countries in North America and Europe.<br/><br/><b>'Underwhelming'</b><br/>However, analysts say Stadia could wind up as another “bet” that Google walks away from if it fails to live up to expectations.<br/>“Stadia will live or die by its content,” said Ovum senior analyst George Jijiashvili.<br/>“The announced 12 launch titles are underwhelming.”<br/>Subscribers will be able to buy games that will be hosted at Google data-centers, but some free games will be available to subscribers, starting with “Destiny 2: The Collection.”<br/>Stadia on smartphones will work with WiFi connections rather than rely on mobile telecom services.<br/>Being able to play without lags or interruptions is paramount to gamers, and flawed Internet connections could cause frustration. Internet speed will also determine how rich in-game graphics can be.<br/>Some promised features such as integration with YouTube will not be in place at launch.<br/>“Stadia appears to be rushed out the door before fully ready and, worryingly, Google is risking falling short on its promises,” Jijiashvili said.<br/>“These shortcomings however would be easily overlooked if Google can deliver a very reliable and high-quality game streaming service.”<br/>Google appears committed to doing just that, according to Ubisoft senior vice president of partnerships Chris Early.<br/>The French video game giant has been working with Google and its games are among titles coming to the service.<br/>“From what I have seen, their plans are too deep; they are too good, and they are too invested,” Early said. “They are not calling it quits any time soon.”<br/>He expects a long launch period during which Google will beef up Stadia.<br/>“If there is a one-day problem at launch, it isn’t the end of the world; it isn’t even close,” he said, stressing the potential for Stadia to let people play without investing in consoles.<br/>But Pachter questioned whether subscriptions were the right approach.<br/>“The right model is pay as you go or pay for the game and play unlimited without a subscription,” Pachter said.<br/>“Amazon will try one of those and will win the streaming wars.”<br/>Amazon has game studios but no online game service.<br/><br/><b>Project xCloud</b><br/>US technology veteran Microsoft has been testing a Project xCloud online game platform.<br/>“Next year, we’ll bring Project xCloud to Windows PCs, and are collaborating with a broad set of partners to make game streaming available on other devices as well,” Microsoft corporate vice president Kareem Choudhry said in an online post.<br/>Sony Interactive Entertainment last month slashed the price of its PlayStation Now cloud video game service by about half in the US to $10 monthly.<br/>Japan-based Sony also boosted the library of games that PlayStation Now users can access through its consoles or on personal computers powered by Windows software.<br/>Sony and Microsoft are also poised to release new-generation video game consoles next year.<br/>“While we expect dedicated consoles to eventually lose relevance in the face of cloud gaming services, there’s no guarantee that it will be Google’s service — rather than Sony and Microsoft’s — that catalyzes this trend,” said Ovum senior analyst Matthew Bailey.</p>
