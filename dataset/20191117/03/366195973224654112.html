      <p>Singer Parisalexa is gradually emerging from the label of Seattle's best-kept secret to a strong name in the realm of R&amp;B's upstarts. Fresh off a work with Xavier Omar, Sango, and Tuxedo, Paris now touches down with her own "2 Real" offering.</p>
      <p>"When I wrote this song I was fed up," she reveals in a statement. "I felt betrayed by people that I put my trust in (men, friends, collaborators) and I really took a moment to reevaluate my expectations of others. I reassessed a lot of relationships, and fortunately met new friends that reciprocated what I was putting out. They showed me that not everyone is fake, not everyone says they're going to do something and doesn't do it. So that’s where I am now; too genuine for the average friendship, too deep for a surface level relationship. And I’ve learned my true value. No matter what the vibe around me is, I'm perfectly fine with being too real."</p>
