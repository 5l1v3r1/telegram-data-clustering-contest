      <h1>Social Security is surprisingly insecure</h1>

      <p>With the stock market hitting another all-time high last week, it sure would be nice to see Washington do something intelligent with our FICA tax/Social Security dollars.</p>
      <p>Instead, the DC Dimwits are collecting a whole lot of our money and investing it entirely in US Treasury securities — its own cheap funding source — intentionally letting the principal sit in the least productive fashion, earning meager T-bill yields for Social Security recipients.</p>
      <p>When I asked a few people I consider smart if they thought DC should allocate some Social Security dollars to equities, the answers were “it makes too much sense” with a laugh, or a simple “of course they should.”</p>
      <p>Clearly, the funds collected are not being invested to taxpayers’ advantage.</p>
      <p>If the bungling bureaucrats treated our Social Security dollars the way the rest of America invests their 401(k)s, pensions, IRAs and other retirement funds, Social Security would be in better shape today and tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Stocks have outperformed every asset class over every 20-, 30- and 50-year period. And while Social Security funds do need to be a very stable investment, they would in fact be more stable with 20 percent of our FICA tax dollars invested in stocks.</p>
      <p>And besides, what could be more “woke” than letting all Americans participate in the stock market?</p>
      <p>I think individuals should be able to make their own decisions with their own money. But Social Security, while a fallback retirement plan for some, is the only one for many.</p>
      <p>Wouldn’t it be nice if every American could at least own some stock in America?</p>
      <p>That is a winning campaign strategy. Let’s see which presidential candidate embraces the American taxpayer and does right by our money!</p>
