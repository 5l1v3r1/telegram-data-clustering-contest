      <p>A courier delivery person, who had been missing since Friday night, was found dead inside an HSVP water-supply manhole, near his house, on the Sector 15-16 dividing road of Panchkula, Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The victim, Tarsem Gupta, had set out of his house around 7.30 pm on Friday to distribute some pamphlets in Sector 16. “It seems as if he fell into the pit by accident and died at the spot,” said Inspector Karambir, SHO Crime Branch, Sector 19. An FIR was registered in the matter, under Section 304A (causing death by negligence) of the IPC.</p>
      <p>The police said the victim’s family had gotten suspicious when Tarsem did not return even after 9.30 pm and they started looking for him everywhere. After finding no other option, the family submitted a written missing complaint at the Sector 14 police station.</p>
      <p>The victim’s body was spotted by a sanitation worker, who then informed the police around 12 pm on Saturday. Following the information a crime team arrived on the spot and the victim was taken to Civil Hospital Panchkula for post-mortem.</p>

      <p>The pamphlets that Tarsem was supposed to distribute, were also found near the manhole, indicating that he was on his way to distribute them when he fell into the manhole, a police official said.</p>
      <p>“The FIR holds the Public Health department accountable for the uncovered manhole but we suspect it falls under HSVP’s authority. We will verify the same,” said DCP Kamaldeep Goyal.</p>
      <p>XEN HSVP Karan Singh Ahlawat said, “We do not know how the manhole was open. We shut all manholes. I think somebody stole the covers of this one. We even conduct weekly surveys to check if any manhole is uncovered. We will look into how this happened.”</p>
      <p>Tarsem is survived by two sons, Aman Gupta and Vishal Gupta and wife Veena Gupta.</p>
