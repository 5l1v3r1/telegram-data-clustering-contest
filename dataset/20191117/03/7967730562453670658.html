      <h1>Phoenix told to lift or lose in Monday clash with Sixers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T03:09:48+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 03:09</time> by <a rel="author">Roy Ward</a></address>
      <p>Lift or lose – that's the clear message South East Melbourne Phoenix coach Simon Mitchell has for his side ahead of Monday night's clash with Adelaide 36ers at Melbourne Arena.</p>
      <p>The Phoenix are coming off a crushing loss to Melbourne United on Saturday night where they led for 33 of the 40 minutes <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53b8s.html">only to be beaten 96-95 after United guard Melo Trimble drew a contentious foul</a> with two seconds to play, allowing him to hit the winning free throw.</p>

      <p>Many people pointed to the Trimble foul call and a no-call the previous play after Phoenix centre Keith Benson, who scored a season-high 20 points and blocked five shots, tied scores with a contested dunk with 13 seconds left which should have seen him shoot an additional free throw after taking contact on the play.</p>
      <p>But Mitchell refused to blame the referees, pointing to his side's lack of poise in the final minutes.</p>

      <p>Monday's opponent, the Sixers, have lost their last four games, including a 99-95 defeat to Perth Wildcats in Adelaide on Friday. The Phoenix beat them 101-91 in Melbourne to start the losing run.</p>
      <p>"If we don't bounce back, we don't come out and execute at the end of quarters then we are going to lose," Mitchell said.</p>
      <p>"Adelaide is a good basketball team, their pride has been dented. They have lost four in a row and dropped one at home the other night, so they will be coming out with a point to prove.</p>
      <p>"That's the way this league is. If you drop off three or four per cent then, forget about it, it's past you. If we do that against Adelaide we will lose. Simple as that.</p>
      <p>Phoenix star John Roberson had his worst night this season on Saturday with eight points and six assists before fouling out.</p>
      <p>Mitchell felt his side were looking for Roberson too much during the last term instead of trusting in their offence, while they also struggled to find Mitch Creek (27 points) in his best areas after he dominated the first half with 19 points.</p>
      <p>Creek will no doubt have another big performance ready against his former side, but Mitchell believes controlling defensive rebounds and keeping Adelaide from drawing fouls and shooting free throws will be the biggest task.</p>
      <p>"I thought we controlled the pace last time we played Adelaide, but they are a different team and different set of circumstances we have to deal with," Mitchell said.</p>
      <p>"There is maybe a comparison in that we think we had some [match-up] advantages tonight that we think carry over to the Adelaide game, and we'll look to exploit those.</p>
      <p>"We will have to be very committed to box out and limit them to one shot per possession, and they get to the line a lot."</p>
      <p>The Phoenix are offering 30 per cent off tickets to Monday’s game and will host a post-game signing session with part-owner and retired NBA star Zach Randolph.</p>
      <h3>United hopeful of Prather return</h3>
      <p>Melbourne United star Casey Prather missed Saturday night's game after struggling with back spasms last week.</p>
      <p>Prather felt his back spasm as he went for a lose ball last Tuesday at training, and Melbourne decided to be cautious with him.</p>

      <p>United coach Dean Vickerman admitted his players were feeling for Prather, who missed the opening rounds after knee surgery.</p>
      <p>"Seeing Casey playing then to see him have another dip, it was a little bit of a hit for the team," Vickerman said.</p>
      <p>"We want to see him up. We think we will get him right for next weekend to play Brisbane, then we have a [road] double after that."</p>
      <p>Vickerman added his side would take belief from how well they played in the final minutes on Saturday night, as they defended strongly and had Trimble make great decisions with ball in hand in United's fifth straight victory.</p>
      <p>"You build belief with good performances and we've had some quarters that have been outstanding and blown the game out," Vickerman said.</p>
      <p>"But I'm not sure we've had that last five minutes of a game where we have surged to a win."</p>
