      <p>The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has kicked off the process of uploading maps of unauthorised colonies on its website. As part of the first phase, maps of 20 such colonies were uploaded Saturday.</p>
      <p>To map the boundaries of 1,728 unauthorised colonies in the capital, which received the Centre’s approval for regularisation last month, the DDA has sourced satellite images from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).</p>
      <p>The key responsibility of implementing the Centre’s decision lies with the DDA, the city’s land-owning agency, which has set itself an ambitious deadline of three months to execute the project.</p>
      <p>A senior official said that maps of colonies such as Vasu Vihar and Phool Bagh have been uploaded, and around 500 such maps have been prepared.</p>
      <p>Officials at the DDA, Survey of India and Department of Revenue of the Government of India have delineated the boundaries of more than 500 unauthorised colonies, a senior official said.</p>
      <p>The resident welfare associations (RWAs) have been requested to give their suggestions and comments on the delineated boundaries within 15 days of uploading them, the official added.</p>
      <p>He said that the RWAs can also point out any discrepancy which can be rectified, along with reasons and supporting documents on the DDA portal, which will be launched soon.</p>
      <p>At a press conference Thursday, Delhi <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> chief Manoj Tiwari had said registration of properties in the 1,731 unauthorised colonies in the capital will begin in the last week of November.</p>
