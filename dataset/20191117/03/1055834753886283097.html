      <p>A week ago, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/?s=Nintendo">Nintendo</a> released a <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/?s=Nintendo+Switch">Switch</a> commercial called “Our Favorite Ways to Play”. There were many kids and teens in the commercial, including 16-year-old Aaron Waddingham. Waddingham has Down syndrome, and his mother says that this had a lot to do with why her son was in the commercial in the first place. Sue Robins, his mom said that “Nintendo very specifically wanted somebody with a visible disability”. Robins also said that a combination of his acting coach and drama classes helped prepare him for the Nintendo shoot and rehearsal. She also said that “it was pretty cool because it was a rehearsal to play a video game. They trained him how to play the Nintendo game, which I think you already knew how to play, because you’re a 16-year-old boy”. Robins’ tweeted about it too, so you can see her tweet down below.</p>
