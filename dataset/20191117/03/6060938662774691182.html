      <h1>Virat Kohli's India enjoying Test success at 'pace'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T03:47:05+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 03:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Ruchir-Mishra-479203379.cms" target="_blank">Ruchir Mishra</a></address>
      <h3>Highlights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>India won the first Test against Bangladesh by an innings and 130 runs inside three days</li>
        <li>Led by the pace attack, India bundled out the visitors for 150 and 213 in the two innings</li>
        <li>Since 2018, it was the 38th time that India bowled out the opponents -- the most by any team</li>
      </ul>

      <p>INDORE: Until now, India never really had a pool of great fast bowlers playing together. Kapil Dev’s arrival in the late 1970s was a revolution, but he would only get pace partners for brief periods before they would disappear from the international scene. None could match Dev. Javagal Srinath’s emergence raised hopes but then again, there was no pace-bowling pool as such, not even when Zaheer Khan started playing.</p>

      <p>The problem persisted till <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ishant-sharma">Ishant Sharma</a> burst on to the scene as a 19-year-old. Luck struck with Ishant, and today as a veteran on the international scene, he finds himself playing alongside a bunch of world-class fast men. In Ishant, Mohammad Shami, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/umesh-yadav">Umesh Yadav</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/jasprit-bumrah">Jasprit Bumrah</a>, India have an attack which is the envy of most teams.</p>
      <p>Probably for the first time, India’s pacers — each a match-winner in his own right — are sharing wickets and responsibility. Now, pressure is maintained from both ends and there is no respite for the opposition.</p>

      <p>It was expected that inexperienced Bangladesh would struggle against them, but they put in an exceptional effort against South Africa too, picking up 26 wickets as compared to 34 by the spinners. Unlike 2015, when India preferred square turners, they played on competitive wickets and still managed to beat South Africa comprehensively.</p>
      <p>Naturally, Team India bowling coach Bharat Arun was a satisfied man.</p>
      <p>“They have hunger to do well. Ours is an extremely skilled bowling attack. If you can bring in a lot of discipline into the skill, it makes them perform well time and again,” Arun said.</p>

      <p>India have inflicted the most all-outs, 38, since 2018, which tells the story. The next best are England with 30. True to their head coach’s word the, Indian pace bowlers have taken the pitch out of equation.</p>
      <p>Skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> is proud of his fast men.</p>
      <p>“The fast bowlers are on top of their game. It looks like a different pitch when they bowl. Right now, Jasprit is not a part of the attack. So, when he comes back it will be one heck of an attack to counter. It’s a dream bowling combination for any skipper. Even the slip fielders are ready, as they know the ball can come any time. This is a dream combination for any captain. Having strong bowlers is the most important thing in any team,” he added.</p>

      <p>Bangladesh coach Russell Domingo has seen India opt for square turners in 2015 when he was with South Africa. Four years later, the colour of wickets has changed.</p>
      <p>“In the past, India backed themselves to win at home on spinning pitches. Now, that’s not the case,” he said.</p>
