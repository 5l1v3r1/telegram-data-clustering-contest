      <p><b>Colombo:</b> Having passed the three million vote-count on Sunday, former wartime defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa claimed victory in the presidential election in<a href="https://www.india.com/news/world/sri-lanka-presidential-polls-over-50-per-cent-voter-turnout-recorded-in-seven-districts-3845411/"> Sri Lanka</a>, stated news agency AFP. Spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella told news agency AFP that Gotabaya Rajapaksa has won the presidency with a clear majority between 53 and 54 per cent of the total votes.</p>
      <p>Out of half a million votes counted on early Sunday morning, Rajapaksa secured 52.87 per cent, housing minister Sajith Premadasa secured 39.67 per cent of the votes followed by leftist Anura Kumara Dissanayake with 4.69 per cent, stated the Sri Lanka Election Commission. Notably, a voter turnout of more than 80 per cent was recorded as on November 17 of the total 15.99 million eligible voters for the presidential election in the island nation, added the National Election Commission.</p>
      <p>Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the 70-year-old, is a Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) candidate and brother of two-time former president Mahinda Rajapaksa. On early November 17, during the vote counting, Gotabaya was reported to be leading in most of the Sinhalese areas. Of the total 35 candidates contesting in the elections, the top contenders include a 52-year-old candidate from the ruling New Democratic Front (NDF) party Sajith Premadasa who received support from the minority Tamil community dwelling in the northern and eastern region of Sri Lanka, stated a report. Yet another strong candidate who is contesting in the polls is Anura Kumara Dissanayake from the National Peopleâ€™s Power (NPP) coalition.</p>
      <p>The final results of the election were scheduled to be declared by late Sunday. In view of the Presidential election, over 12,000 voting centres were set up across Sri Lanka.</p>
