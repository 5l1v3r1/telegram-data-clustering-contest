      <h1>Micah Parsons Isn’t Downplaying Penn State’s Game vs. Ohio State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T03:57:23+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 03:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Another weekend of college football is in the books. There will be plenty of change in the polls this week after Iowa took down Minnesota, Georgia escaped Auburn and Saturday night’s Oklahoma-Baylor game concludes.</p>
      <p>Week 13 will bring a few of the biggest games of the season. Arguably the best game of the weekend will kick off from Columbus.</p>
      <p>No. 1 Ohio State hosts No. 9 Penn State in a battle of Big Ten powers.</p>
      <p>One Nittany Lions star knows Saturday’s game is the most important game of the season. Star linebacker Micah Parsons called it the “Big Ten championship” – with no respect to the Big Ten West.</p>
      <p>Here’s what he said, via Audrey Snyder of <a href="https://twitter.com/audsnyder4/status/1195897740095606784">the Athletic</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“I told people already, this is the Big Ten championship right here, next Saturday. This is gonna make or break either one of our seasons, you know, this is it right now.”</blockquote>
      <p>He has a point. Whoever wins Saturday’s game will likely be the favorite to win the Big Ten title game.</p>
      <p>However, Ohio State still has Michigan to take care of, while Penn State faces off against Rutgers in the final regular season game.</p>
      <p>Penn State and Ohio State kick off at 12:00 p.m. ET. The game will be broadcast on FOX.</p>
