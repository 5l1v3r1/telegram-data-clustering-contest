      <p>Exiled former Zimbabwe government minister and G40 kingpin Jonathan Moyo has shared some photos of his great escape during the November 2017 coup.</p>
      <p>Sharing the pictures on Twitter Moyo shared the sentiments below:</p>
      <blockquote>Sight after crossing Ruya River into Mozambique. At this time #TrevorNcube was lying on &amp; to readers of his newspapers that we were under arrest at KGVI barracks. The other gentleman is a Mozambican. Details are in a coup story, yet to be told!</blockquote>
      <p>Moyo and Kasuwere were targeted by security forces after General Chiwenga’s soldiers overthrew Mugabe’s government in a bloodless coup.</p>
