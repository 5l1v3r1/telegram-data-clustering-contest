      <p>Days after a 30-year-old man allegedly committed suicide, police have filed an FIR of abetment of suicide against his ex-girlfriend and her two friends. No arrest has been made so far, an officer said.</p>
      <p>Police said the man, Harpreet Singh, allegedly committed suicide on November 12.</p>
      <p>Police said they found a video in Singh’s phone, along with a letter, wherein he allegedly blamed his ex-girlfriend and her two friends for prompting him to take the extreme step.</p>
      <p>Additional DCP (Outer) Rajender Singh Sagar said, “In the letter, Singh claimed that his former partner refused to return the money he had lent her. He also claimed that he was being threatened with false FIRs by the former partner and her friends. We are investigating the matter. No arrests have been made so far.”</p>
      <p>Singh’s brother Jaspreet (25) said that the two met one-and-a-half years ago and broke up three months ago.</p>
      <p>“She started avoiding him and would keep blocking his number. Our family visited her family a day before Diwali to talk about marriage but she refused,” he claimed.</p>
      <p>In the letter and the video, Singh alleged that the woman threatened to file a false rape case against him. Police said that the allegation is under investigation.</p>
      <p>In the purported suicide letter, addressed to his family, Singh wrote, “I tried to forget the pain and betrayal but couldn’t… please update the news of my death on <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/facebook/">Facebook</a>.” , (right) what camera caught. Assam Forest Department</p>
