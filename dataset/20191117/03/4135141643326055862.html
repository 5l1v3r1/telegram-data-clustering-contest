      <p>ST. LOUIS — <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/derek-grant-player-stats">Derek Grant</a> completed his first career hat trick, <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/ryan-getzlaf-player-stats">Ryan Getzlaf</a> added a goal and an assist, and the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/anaheim-ducks-team">Anaheim Ducks</a> beat the St. Louis <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/st-louis-blues-team">Blues</a> 4-1 Saturday night.</p>
      <p>It was just the second multigoal game of Grant’s 229-game career and first since Oct. 20, 2017.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/john-gibson-player-stats">John Gibson</a> made 37 saves as the Ducks snapped a five-game losing streak.</p>
      <p>Vince Dunn scored and Jordan Binnington made 21 saves for the Blues, who had their nine-game points streak snapped with their first regulation loss since October 26.</p>
      <p>Grant’s second of the game thwarted a Blues rally by restoring Anaheim’s two-goal lead with an unassisted short-handed goal at 7:20 of the second. Grant stole Justin Faulk’s pass to create a breakaway and beat Binnington with a backhander between his legs to make it 3-1.</p>
      <p>Grant finished the hat trick with an empty-netter with 1:39 left.</p>
      <p>It was the fourth short-handed goal of the season for the Ducks. The Blues have given up three.</p>
      <p>Getzlaf gave the Ducks a 1-0 lead four minutes into the game, finishing on a perfectly executed give-and-go with <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/max-jones-player-stats">Max Jones</a>. Getzlaf has 38 points in 42 career games against St. Louis.</p>
      <p>Grant made it 2-0 at the 5:41 mark, capitalizing on Alex Pietrangelo’s turnover that was caused by <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/nicolas-deslauriers-player-stats">Nicolas Deslauriers</a>’ check. It was Grant’s first goal in six games.</p>
      <p>Dunn got the Blues on the board with a wrister from the top of the right circle for his third goal of the season at the 3:14 mark of the second period.</p>
      <p>NOTES: The Blues entered the game 8-0-2 against the Western Conference and were the only team in the NHL to have not lost a regulation game against a Western Conference team. … The Ducks have won four straight in St. Louis dating to Nov. 29, 2017. … LW David Perron, a former Duck, played in his 800th career game and 500th as a Blue. … <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/jakob-silfverberg-player-stats">Jakob Silfverberg</a> and <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/adam-henrique-player-stats">Adam Henrique</a> each had their four-game points streak snapped.</p>
