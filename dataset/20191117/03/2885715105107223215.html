      <p>South Delhi will soon get four new parks, aimed at children aged up to 12-14 years, complete with tree decks, multi-play equipment and innovative swings, a senior official of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) said Saturday.</p>
      <p>Entry of parents will be allowed only if they are accompanying their children, he said.</p>
      <p>The parks will be built in Kalkaji, New Friends Colony, Dwarka Sector 19 and Janakpuri.</p>
      <p>The park at Dwarka Sector 19 is half-complete and will likely be inaugurated in a couple of months, while the other parks will be completed in ten months, he said.</p>
      <p>These parks will be ticketed and people will have to pay around Rs 20 for entry. The park at Kalkaji will be built atop the multi-level underground parking while the final spots for the other parks are still being decided, the official said.</p>
      <p>The SDMC already has a children’s park in Greater Kailash II named Nadan Van, where Rs 20 is charged to keep the loiterers away.</p>
      <p>“These parks receive a big footfall, so we have to keep a nominal entry charge. We want that our children not be confined to their TVs, video games and mobile phones,” he said.</p>
      <p>For adults visiting the parks with their children, features such as benches, gazebos, walkways, rubberised pathways for exercise will also be included.</p>
      <p>The lack of open spaces to play has always been a major issue in the capital.</p>
      <p>Civic agencies received flak from the Delhi High Court in 2014 for poor upkeep of playfields, and in 2015, the court passed an order upholding the right of children to play in parks.</p>
      <p>It also asked civic agencies to make playgrounds in every neighbourhood.</p>
      <p>The court authorised the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to intervene and suggest measures to maintain parks in the capital.</p>
