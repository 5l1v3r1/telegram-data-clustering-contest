      <h1>New BJP poll slogan for Delhi: Ek vote, teen sarkar</h1>
      <h2>Senior leaders, as well as booth- and mandal-level workers are expected to take this message to people in the days ahead.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T03:09:16+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 03:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/abhinav-rajput/" target="_blank">Abhinav Rajput</a></address>
      <p>Delhi <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> chief Manoj Tiwari said the party will head into the Delhi Assembly polls with the slogan <i>‘ek vote, teen sarka</i>r’ — to convey to people that if they vote for BJP in Delhi, it will help strengthen the municipal corporations and the Centre.</p>
      <p>“This will also ensure the buck is not passed; if work is done smoothly, we will get the credit, and if it isn’t done, people will know exactly who to blame,” he said.</p>
      <p>“For the people of Delhi, this election is not just about choosing a BJP government in Delhi, but to also ensure that the Centre’s welfare schemes like Ayushman Bharat and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, which are being halted by the Delhi government, finally get implemented.</p>
      <p>“Several people come to my office to get registered under PMAY. I have begun noting down their names so that we get those eligible enrolled in the scheme as soon as we form the government in Delhi,” he said.</p>
      <p>Tiwari also said a BJP government in Delhi will mean the three MCDs, currently ruled by the BJP, get the money “that is due to them”.</p>
      <p>Senior leaders, as well as booth- and mandal-level workers are expected to take this message to people in the days ahead.</p>
      <p>The other major poll plank will be the regularisation of unauthorised colonies, in the wake of the Centre’s announcement in this regard.</p>
      <p>The Delhi BJP Saturday also protested near the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/aam-aadmi-party/">Aam Aadmi Party</a> office against “baseless allegations” levelled by the party against the Modi government over the Rafale deal.</p>
      <p>Led by Tiwari, party workers demanded an apology from AAP for “trying to malign” the PM’s image. On Friday, the party had protested near the Congress headquarters over the same issue.</p>
