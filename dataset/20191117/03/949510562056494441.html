      <h1>Democrat Edwards wins reelection in conservative Louisiana</h1>

      <p>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Louisiana’s voters have reelected Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards to a second term, deep in the heart of the conservative South. Saturday’s election outcome shocked Republicans who hoped to reclaim the seat on the strength of President Donald Trump’s popularity.</p>
      <p>The moderate Edwards cobbled together enough cross-party support with his focus on bipartisan, state-specific issues to defeat Republican businessman Eddie Rispone. Edwards received about 51% of the vote.</p>
      <p>Trump made three trips to Louisiana to rally against Edwards.</p>
      <p>But the president’s interest in the race not only motivated conservative Republicans, but also powered a surge in anti-Trump and black voter turnout that helped boost Edwards.</p>
      <p>Coming after a defeat in the Kentucky governor’s race, the Louisiana result seems certain to rattle Republicans as they head into the 2020 presidential election.</p>
