      <h1>Sources: Doctors tell Matthew Stafford he has 6-week injury; QB could return sooner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T02:24:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 02:24</time> by <a rel="author">Adam Schefter</a></address>
      <p>Doctors recently told <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions">Detroit Lions</a> quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12483/matthew-stafford">Matthew Stafford</a> that the fractured bones in his back are a six-week injury, league sources told ESPN.</p>
      <p>This doesn't mean Stafford will be sidelined six games, but it does provide a glimpse into the severity of the injury that he has played through before the Lions' doctors denied him from playing last week against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears">Chicago Bears</a> and Sunday against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>, according to a source.</p>
      <p>Stafford will miss his second straight game Sunday, and the Lions still are unsure when he will be able to return. Last week, a source told ESPN that Stafford "could miss one week, he could miss three weeks."</p>
      <p>But Detroit also knows that this type of injury would sideline most players six weeks, if not longer. It is another testament to Stafford's toughness; he had started 136 straight games before last week's absence, the sixth-longest streak for a quarterback in NFL history.</p>
      <p>Before last week, the last Lions quarterback to start a game other than Stafford was Shaun Hill in Week 17 of the 2010 season.</p>
      <p>Stafford has completed 64.3% of his passes for 2,499 yards, 19 touchdowns and five interceptions this season. Earlier this year, he became the fastest quarterback in NFL history to surpass 40,000 passing yards.</p>
      <p>Stafford's current backup, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2574630/jeff-driskel">Jeff Driskel</a>, was unable to rally Detroit to a victory in Chicago, but he will get another opportunity Sunday against Dallas, and he could well be getting more in the weeks to come.</p>
