      <h1>Gareth Bale 'could complete Man Utd transfer in January' - if Paul Pogba goes other way</h1>
      <h2>Real Madrid will reportedly try to use the Welshman to try and complete a move for long-term target Pogba</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T02:11:31+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 02:11</time> by <a rel="author">Hassan Rashed</a></address>
      <p>Real Madrid believe that Gareth Bale could complete a move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> as early as January, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The Wales international was expected to leave the Bernabeu during the summer came close completing a lucrative move to China - only for him to stay put when his move to Jiangsu Suning was blocked by Real.</p>
      <p>United were also believed to have shown interest in the 30-year-old, and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10361226/man-utd-gareth-bale-transfer-paul-pogba-real-madrid/">The Sun</a> claims that the La Liga giants are ready to do business with Premier League club.</p>
      <p>According to the publication, Real believe that the Red Devils are keen to add a star name to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's squad after a difficult start to the season.</p>

      <p>And it is claimed that Los Blancos will attempt to use Bale as a sweetener to try and complete a deal for Zinedine Zidane's long-term target Paul Pogba, with a January transfer believed to be dependent on United's willingness to allow the Frenchman to leave.</p>
      <p>However, <i>The Sun</i> states that Real are convinced the Welshman will head to Old Trafford next summer if he does not complete a switch in the New Year.</p>
      <p>Despite being restored to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> starting XI early in the season, Real are reportedly prepared to let Bale leave after a fresh breakdown in his relationship with boss Zidane and his latest controversy during the international break.</p>
      <p>The winger has not featured for Real since scoring in the 1-1 draw with Granada at the start of October due to a calf injury but made himself available for Wales' current Euro 2020 qualifiers - a decision that was criticised by Madrid team-mate Toni Kroos.</p>

      <p>He also started Saturday's 2-0 win over Azerbaijan after admitting that he gets "more excited" playing for his country than his club.</p>
      <p>Asked if playing for Wales gave him more “joy” ahead of today’s qualifier in Azerbaijan, Bale replied: “Yes definitely.</p>
      <p>“It’s like playing with your mates down the park on a Sunday. I’ve been with most of the older players since we were in Under-17s.</p>
      <p>“It’s normal - with Wales, I’m speaking my own language and feel more comfortable. I definitely have a bit more excitement playing with Wales.</p>
      <p>“But it doesn’t change what I give on the pitch. I always give 100% on the pitch wherever I am.”</p>
