      <p><a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/175/charles-oliveira">Charles Oliveira</a>, known as the most successful submission artist in UFC history, has now knocked out his past two opponents.</p>
      <p>Oliveira starched <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4060/jared-gordon">Jared Gordon</a> in the co-headliner of UFC Sao Paulo on Saturday, extending his current winning streak to six fights and adding another piece of highlight-reel footage to his decorated career.</p>
      <p>Gordon walked into a right hand one minute after the featured lightweight bout, and Oliveira finished the American off with more punches to force referee intervention at the 1:26 mark of the opening frame.</p>

      <p>Oliveira leaped over the fence and bounced around the cage as he celebrated. The crowd at Ginasio do Ibirapuera ate it up.</p>
      <p>Not content with another quick stoppage, Oliveira then called out former two-division champ <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1859/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a>. Acutely aware of that tall order, the Brazilian hedged his bets with a second request â€“ <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2970/paul-felder">Paul Felder</a>, the most recent opponent to defeat him.</p>
