      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 17 — South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg holds a clear lead among Democratic presidential candidates in Iowa, the state that will hold the first nominating contest in February, a new Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom opinion poll showed yesterday.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg’s support climbed to 25 per cent, a 16-point increase since the previous survey in September, CNN reported.</p>
      <p>It said there was a close three-way battle for second with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren at 16 per cent, and former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders each at 15 per cent.</p>
      <p>Since September, Warren dropped six percentage points and Biden slipped five points, while Sanders gained four points, CNN said.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, told the network the news was encouraging and his campaign felt growing momentum in the farm state, but there was “still a lot of work to do” in increasing his name recognition there.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg also led Democratic presidential candidates in Iowa in a Monmouth University poll released on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A New York Times/Sienna poll released earlier this month also showed Buttigieg’s support surging in Iowa, but still behind Warren and Sanders. Nationally, he does not fare nearly as well, averaging around 8 per cent in polls.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg’s campaign is betting a strong finish in the Iowa caucus on Feb. 3 will help quell questions about whether he is ready for the big stage, and persuade reluctant black and Hispanic voters to give him a second look.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg, 37, has invested heavily in Iowa from the start. His campaign has more than 100 staffers and 20 offices in the state, among the most of any candidate.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg finished the third quarter with US$23.4 million in campaign cash on hand, ranking third behind Warren and Sanders at US$25.7 million and US$33.7 million, respectively. Biden had US$8.9 million, forcing his campaign to abandon a promise to reject support from political action committees. — Reuters</p>
