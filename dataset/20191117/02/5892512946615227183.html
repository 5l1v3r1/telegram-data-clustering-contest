      <p>Charles Oliveira continued his lightweight dominance earlier tonight (Sat., Nov. 16, 2019) at UFC Fight Night 164 live on <a href="http://go.web.plus.espn.com/c/482924/595608/9070?sharedid=MMAMania&amp;subId1=xid:fr1573879514136chh">ESPN+</a> from inside Ibirapuera Gymnasium in Sao Paulo, Brazil, as the streaking Brazilian fighter finished Jared Gordon via knockout just 86 seconds into the first round.</p>
      <p>While Oliveira is known for his world-class submission skills, the crafty veteran also packs a punch on the feet. Oliveira used this against Gordon along the cage when the New Yorker started to advance with punches. “Do Bronx” caught Gordon with a nasty right counter that wobbled him. When Gordon started to return to his feet Oliveira blasted him with a vicious uppercut. Gordon fell back into the cage and Oliveira scored one final right hand.</p>

      <p>With this performance, Oliveira extends his current lightweight win streak to six, which have all come by way of knockout or submission. The 30-year-old is now one stoppage away from tying Donald Cerrone for the most finishes in UFC history (16). That’s pretty impressive, but not that surprising considering “do bronx” has finished 26 of his 28 career wins.</p>
