      <h1>ESPN’s 2nd Half Prediction For Baylor-Oklahoma</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T02:24:26+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 02:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>ESPN’s Football Power Index has updated its second half prediction for this evening’s game between Baylor and Oklahoma in Waco. The Bears are currently dominating the Sooners. Will that change in the second half?</p>
      <p>Baylor, which is looking to keep its undefeated season going, has done just about everything right through two quarters against Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>The Bears are leading the Sooners, 31-10, heading into halftime.</p>
      <p>Can Jalen Hurts and Co. get it going in the second half and make this a game? ESPN’s Football Power Index has updated its prediction.</p>
      <h3>ESPN’s Football Power Index thinks this one is over, giving Baylor a 94.1 percent chance to win the game, giving Oklahoma just a 5.9 percent chance of coming back.</h3>
      <p>Oklahoma will effectively be eliminated from College Football Playoff contention with a loss tonight. Baylor, meanwhile, should surge up the rankings with a victory.</p>
      <p>The second half of Baylor-Oklahoma should begin soon on ABC.</p>
