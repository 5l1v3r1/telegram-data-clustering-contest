      <p>Despite being a traditional ruler, Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, doesn’t joke with things that concern God. For instance, visiting churches is a regular routine for him.</p>
      <p>Recently, the Ooni paid a visit to Havilah Mountain of Fire for the church’s 20th anniversary. The seven-day event ended with praise and worship session to celebrate God and the Ooni witnessed it.</p>
      <p>He commended Prophet Israel Olubori for being a pillar behind his wife, the founder of the church, saying his solid support and respect for the prophetess had made her flourish.</p>
      <p>He said: “We thank God for the family of Olubori and we thank God for making them the leaders of this church. I thank the husband because he supports and respects the prophetess. I am happy I witnessed today’s celebration. I let go of many things to be here today because I didn’t know what to tell the prophetess. If anyone says there is no God, it is a big lie. He is the King who crowns all kings. If you are making the prophetess happy, good things will continue to happen to you.”</p>
      <p>The Ooni also presented a gift, a symbolic drawing, to the couple, describing it as priceless.</p>
      <p>A representative of Oba Saheed Ademola Elegushi, CSP Dolapo Badmus, Oba Munirudeen Lawal of Ede, Yinka Ayefele and a host of other top personalities graced the event.</p>
