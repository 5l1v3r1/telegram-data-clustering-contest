      <p>WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Britain’s Prince Charles and his wife Camilla arrived in New Zealand on Sunday for a weeklong trip, during which they plan to visit the city of Christchurch and the historic treaty grounds at Waitangi, where the nation’s founding document was signed.</p>
      <p>It is the couple’s third joint visit to New Zealand and their first in four years.</p>
      <p>Their plane landed in Auckland on Sunday afternoon. Their public duties were due to begin Monday when they planned to lay a wreath at the Mount Roskill War Memorial.</p>
      <p>Among other engagements, the couple is due to meet with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Tuesday, visit the Waitangi Treaty Grounds on Wednesday, and on Friday visit Christchurch, where 51 Muslim worshippers were killed during a March massacre and rebuilding continues after a deadly 2011 earthquake.</p>
      <p>During the trip, Charles plans to visit several organizations focused on environmental issues while Camilla will focus on groups that support women, including those who have survived domestic violence.</p>
      <p>Charles, who last week turned 71, is the heir apparent to the British throne. Camilla, 72, is the Duchess of Cornwall and the prince’s second wife.</p>
