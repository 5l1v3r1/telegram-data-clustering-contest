      <h1>Private schools have widened the education divide</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T02:41:25+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 02:41</time> by <a rel="author">Dr Ian Hansen</a></address>
      <p>In the mid-1960s I conducted the first major academic study of non-government schools in Australia. A product of government high schools myself, I was interested in the sociology of the independent sector. Of necessity, I became involved in the lives and aspirations of these schools and was very soon aware that, with a handful of exceptions, they were not rich schools.</p>
      <p>To my education students at Melbourne University I used to present a typical annual budget of a middle order school, to demonstrate how such schools barely broke even financially. I found myself admiring what they got done, how they managed with often substandard facilities and sensing the unease with which numbers of them had accepted the Menzies federal science grants in 1963.</p>
      <p>By the 1970s there were subtle shifts in the ways these schools saw themselves. Enrolments and then tuition fees increased. Previously there had been an unwritten understanding among themselves that these schools should never advertise; now they began to. Their new self-confidence moved into self-satisfaction.</p>
      <p>The greedy and bustling 1980s caused the schools to slip from an educational model of performing into a business model. Headmasters and headmistresses became principals, CEOs. Money was spent on refurbishing front gates and sporting facilities – anything that would sell an image.</p>
      <p>This was the point at which the understanding patience I had for the non-government sector began to wane. I could feel the divide between "public" schools and "private" schools widening.</p>
      <p>As the one sector grew in social prestige, the other more and more lacked relevance. The drift apart is now near to absolute.</p>

      <p>It has all become political, not vocational. I thought I knew these sorts of schools. I wrote their histories, I spoke at their speech nights, I led their staff conferences. But I don’t know them any more.</p>
      <p>The ABC this year conducted a survey of MySchool data from 8500 schools, which found in the period 2013-17 four non-government schools spent $100 million each on capital works, while in the same period 1300 public schools had been waiting up to 15 years for urgent repairs to their buildings.</p>
      <p>I know a school auditorium that ranks in luxury and acoustics with Hamer Hall. That’s not fair when another school I know still has urinals open to the sky.</p>
      <p>I hope that the powerful lobby groups for non-government schools are pleased with what they’ve achieved.</p>
      <p>Just don’t try to tell me that two parents have to work very hard to find $30,000 a year for their child’s fees. It’s not fair, because there are parents who have to work very hard to find that $30,000 to put food on the table for their families. That’s not fair, either.</p>
