      <p>The UFC Sao Paulo main card is underway, and the promotion’s #13 ranked lightweight Charles Oliveira just knocked out Jared Gordon in less than 90 seconds. Oliveira already owns the record for most wins by submission in UFC history, but now he’s knocking fools out. He extends his winning streak to six, and called out Conor McGregor and Paul Felder in his post-fight interview.</p>

      <p>Before that, Andre Muniz took all the scorecards in his decision win over Antonio Arroyo. He leaned on his superior grappling top get the win, nearly taking home an arm in the first round. Making good on his UFC debut, Muniz has now won five-straight. He seems like a solid addition to the promotion’s middleweight roster. Opening up the main card, Wellington Turman picked up a hard-fought unanimous decision over the quite game Markus Perez. Turman definitely had to earn this one, and walked away with his first UFC win to advance to 16-3 in his professional career. It was quite a showing from someone only 23 years of age.</p>

Arroyo was able to escape by using a leg lock, and then entered the full guard of his opponent. Not much happened there.</p>
