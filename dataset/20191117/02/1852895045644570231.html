      <h4>Hailey and Justin were spotted leaving their favorite dance studio in West Hollywood on Saturday, Nov. 16!</h4>
      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/hailey-baldwin/"><b>Hailey Baldwin</b></a>, 22, loves how <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/tag/justin-bieber"><b>Justin Bieber</b></a>, 25, can move! “yo…husband can really dance his a** off,” she wrote in an Instagram story on Saturday, Nov. 16. “Annoying proud wifey brag I know, but sheesh” she wrote, adding a heart-eye emoji. She didn’t add any videos or photos on her IG story, but as all know, Justin is a seriously talented dancer! He’s been revered for his hip hop moves throughout his career, constantly impressing fans with his music videos and tours. For her part, Hailey also has a background as a dance pro: the model actively pursued ballet throughout her childhood and teen years, at and, at one point, even wanted to go pro!</p>
      <p>The pair were seen exiting a dance studio in West Hollywood on the afternoon of Saturday, Nov. 16 together — something that has become a go-to activity for the newly married couple. Hailey — who was sipping on a coffee from Blue Bottle — kept things casual for the occasion, rocking a cropped white crew neck sweatshirt, matching sweats, crisp Nike sneakers and a to-die-for black “New Wave Bumbag” fanny pack by luxury label Louis Vuitton. Justin was also appropriately dressed for the session in a dark gray pair of <b>Alexander Wang</b> sweats, sneakers, a black sweatshirt and a beige jacket. Both were fall-ready in cozy beanies, though, we aren’t sure they needed them with the Los Angeles weather hitting the mid-70s! Of note, the couple have been spotted at the <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/08/31/hailey-baldwin-abs-bright-crop-top-justin-bieber-dance-studio-pics/">same dance studio before</a>, located on West 3rd, and dining at nearby sushi spot Katsuya.</p>
      <p>The newlyweds appeared to be enjoying the day together, and were earlier spotted <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/16/justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-romantic-bike-ride-see-pic/">biking together</a> around Beverly Hills. Justin and Hailey looked seriously adorable as they cuddled up on one bike, reminiscent if <b>Tom Cruise</b>‘s iconic <i>Top Gun</i> scene!</p>

      <p>Hailey held on tight as Justin pedaled through the ritzy neighborhood, laughing and smiling along the way! Hailey appeared to keep her outfit on from earlier in the day, while Justin swapped out his Drew House t-shirt and purple shorts for the ensemble he hit the studio in.</p>

      <p>Justin and Hailey have been practically inseparable since <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/10/02/hailey-baldwin-wedding-dress-justin-bieber-married/">their wedding in South Carolina</a> on Sept. 30, and have been spotted regularly hitting the dance studio, dining and enjoying their time since! Given the pair <i>both</i> love dancing, we can only dream of seeing them perform together in a music video at some point — fingers crossed!</p>
