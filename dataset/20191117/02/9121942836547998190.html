      <p>VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis is decrying that the “greed of a few” wealthy people is compounding the plight of the poor.</p>
      <p>Francis celebrated a Mass Sunday in St. Peter’s Basilica dedicated to heightening awareness about poor people worldwide. He lamented that people aren’t worried that income “gaps are increasing, that the greed of a few is adding to the poverty of many others.”</p>
      <p>Keeping a tradition of his papacy, Francis invited 1,500 indigent persons to dine with him at the Vatican after Mass, while another 1,500 will be treated to a separate lunch elsewhere in Rome.</p>
      <p>Francis said faithful should ask themselves: “Do I, as a Christian, have at least one poor person as a friend?”</p>
      <p>He has made paying attention to those living on society’s margins a priority of his pontificate.</p>
