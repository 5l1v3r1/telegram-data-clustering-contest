      <p>A nine-month pregnant woman was killed on Saturday when a truck rammed into the bike she was travelling on near Amravati enclave in Panchkula.</p>
      <p>The woman, identified as Sonia Devi (22), died on the spot. Her body was taken to the hospital where doctors performed an operation and managed to retrieve a baby boy. However, the infant too died after four hours.</p>
      <p>The incident happened around 10.45 am when Sonia Devi and her husband Tarsem Lal were going to Chandikotla from her maternal house in Pinjore. Sonia was run over by the truck, however, her husband managed to escape without injuries. After unsuccessfully trying to stop the vehicles passing by the highway, Tarsem took her to the Civil Hospital in a toll plaza car.</p>
      <p>Dr Sangeeta Singhal, who headed the operation at the Civil Hospital, said, “I quickly asked the staff to bring her body to the gynae surgery room and put the pediatrics team on standby. A team of three doctors including Dr Poonam, Dr Anita and myself, performed the surgery which barely took five minutes. This was the first time that we performed such a surgery.”</p>
      <p>“The child was asphyxiated due to lack of oxygen and had to be revived. We gave it the necessary care and we got a heartbeat. The child was very critical since the beginning and died at around 3.30 pm,” said Dr Gagan, Pediatrician at the Civil hospital.</p>
      <p>The driver of the truck managed to escape after the accident.</p>
      <p>“The truck has been confiscated. We will nab the driver very soon”, said Inspector Yashdeep Singh, incharge of Pinjore Police Station. The body of the child was handed over to his family.</p>
      <p>“It was their two-year-anniversary on November 18. The child was our only hope. We could have saved the baby had we managed to bring her to the hospital in time,” said Sonia’s father, Rampal, adding that the doctors had given the delivery date of November 24. .</p>
