      <h1>Nicolas Cage May Face Off Against His ’90s Self In A New Super Meta Movie</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T02:00:58+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 02:00</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Story</a></address>
      <p>Nicolas Cage is apparently in talks to star as a version of himself in a brand new movie called <i>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</i>, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/nicolas-cage-star-as-nicolas-cage-unbearable-weight-massive-talent-1254626">according to The Hollywood Reporter</a>. Production company Lionsgate is in final negotiations to pick up the flick.</p>
      <p>The film is co-written by and directed by Tom Gorbican, who created <i>Ghosted</i>, a short-lived paranormal comedy series starring Adam Scott and Craig Robinson. It’s also co-written by Kevin Etten (<i>Workaholics</i>, <i>Scrubs</i>).</p>

      <p>In it, Cage stars as a version of himself, who is trying to score a role in a new Tarantino feature, as he tries to mend his troubled relationship with his teenage daughter. (The real Nicolas Cage does not have a daughter). At the same time, his ’90s self keeps popping up to berate him “for making too many crappy movies and for not being a star anymore”.</p>
      <p>To try to ease his mounting debts, Cage appears at the birthday of a Mexican billionaire – who is actually a drug cartel kingpin under investigation by the CIA. He also wants to work on a film script with Cage, which itself starts to mirror the events of <i>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</i>. There is SO MUCH going on here.</p>
      <p>The plot apparently explicitly references Cage’s career, including his moody turn in <i>Leaving Las Vegas</i>, his action star moment in <i>Gone in 60 Seconds</i> and his role as John-Travolta-trapped-in-Nic-Cage’s-body in <i>Face/Off</i>.</p>
      <p>To get Cage to come on board, Gormican apparently wrote to the actor, explaining that the story isn’t meant to make fun of him. Rather it’s a “love letter to the actor”.</p>
      <p>The best part about this story is that the script was written as a sample script as a way for Gormican and Etten to get work – it was never intended to be made into a film. It’s just that people though it had legs…</p>
      <p>It’s probably safe to expect at least one patented Nicolas Cage freakout:</p>
