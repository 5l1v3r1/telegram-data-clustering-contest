      <p>TORONTO – Something about playing on a big stage must have stirred the St. Bonaventure men’s basketball team.</p>
      <p>The Bonnies earned their first win of the season Saturday in the James Naismith Classic at Scotiabank Arena, and it wasn’t the usual names who led them.</p>
      <p>A youth movement fueled the Bonnies in an 80-74 win against Rutgers, as freshman guard Alejandro Vasquez scored 20 points and freshman forward Justin Winston scored 19. Their scoring aptitude early in the game ultimately helped Bona (1-3) withstand Rutgers’ attempt at a second-half rally.</p>
      <p>“With Osun (Osunniyi) out, we need those freshmen,” Bonnies coach Mark Schmidt said. “We need to have a couple of them to have some success, and one of the reasons we won and had a big lead in the first half was because of the two freshmen. They grew up. They played with confidence. The game wasn’t too big for them, and that’s what we need from them.”</p>
      <p>Their aggressive play – and their penchant for finding the basket, both from short-range and from long-distance – was valuable for Bona, in order to set the tone early. Vasquez and Winston combined for 11 points in a 15-4 run at the start of the game that gave the Bonnies a 15-9 lead in the first 7 1/2 minutes.</p>
      <p>“That was the memo, from the beginning,” Vasquez said. “We wanted to come out with energy and just set it, from the top.</p>
      <p>Kyle Lofton relished the reinforcement by Vasquez and Winston.</p>
      <p>“It meant a lot. It just shows us that they can step in and make big plays as well as us,” said Lofton, who scored 17 points and had eight assists. “And them helping us, it took pressure off me and Dom (Welch), the primary scorers.”</p>
      <p>But Rutgers (3-1) cut Bona’s lead to four points twice in the final six minutes: first, with 5:02 left, on Akwasi Yeboah’s layup off a backdoor pass from Jacob Young that made it 67-63. Vasquez answered with a 3-pointer that opened the lead back to seven.</p>
      <p>Then, with a minute left in the game, Rutgers guard Caleb McConnell (13 points) stripped the ball from Winston and went in uncontested for a layup, cutting Bona’s lead to 75-71.</p>
      <p>Rutgers coach Steve Pikiell had a plan for his team in the final minutes.</p>
      <p>“I wanted them to get a stop,” Pikiell said. “They had a short shot clock and then made a timely basket and put it right back up, the lead. We’ve been in that position before, in win time, and they beat us.”</p>
      <p>Bona had a plan, too.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to stay poised,” Vasquez said. “We didn’t want to panic.”</p>
      <p>The  Scarlet Knights went without a field goal for more than six minutes in the first half as the Bonnies shined on the perimeter, hitting 6 of their 11 3-point attempts in the first half. Winston hit Bona's sixth 3-pointer, which forced Rutgers to call a timeout with Bona ahead 34-15 with 5:18 left in the first half.</p>
      <p>Down 43-24 with a minute left, the Scarlet Knights, however, cut Bona’s lead to 13 with 45 seconds left, first on Yeboah’s three-point play with 1:21 left, and 36 seconds later, Baker’s 3-pointer for Rutgers made it 43-30.</p>
      <p>But Robert Carpenter fouled Young under the basket with .2 seconds left, and after Young missed both free throws, Yeboah missed a layup at the buzzer that would have cut Bona’s lead to 11.</p>
      <p>Bona, however, maintained at least an eight-point berth in the second half, even after Montez Mathis hit a pair of free throws after Lofton was called for a flagrant foul with 10:21 left, until the Scarlet Knights cut it to 67-63 with 5:02 left on Yeboah’s layup.</p>
      <p>Finally, Vasquez’s 3-pointer from the corner ended a scoreless drought of more than five minutes and opened Bona’s lead to seven at 70-63 with 4:36 left. But after Bonnies forward Amadi Ikpeze (eight rebounds)  fouled out with 2:42 left and McConnell cut it to four with 1:01 left, the Bonnies made five of their six free throws in the final 32 seconds.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t execute perfectly in the second half, near the end, but we made our foul shots,” Schmidt said. “We finished it the way we needed it. We got a couple stops.”</p>
