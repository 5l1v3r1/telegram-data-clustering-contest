      <h3>Iceman too hot for Anderson to handle</h3>
      <p>Gerwyn Price muted the crowd as he ruthlessly ended Gary Anderson's bid to win a maiden Boylesports Grand Slam of Darts title in Wolverhampton.</p>
      <p>The only similarities between this eagerly-anticipated showdown and last year's <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/grand-slam-of-darts-final-day-live/155058">controversial final</a> was that it was between the same players on this very stage and the same winner.</p>
      <p>Apart from that there was none of the histrionics, confrontations and booing that made their showdown 12 months ago one of the most talked about in recent times while in terms of the actual result, it wasn't even close as the <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/boos-ring-out-as-price-triumphs/155062">defending champion</a> cruised to a one-sided 16-9 triumph.</p>
      <p>Whereas last year Price had to dig deep with a pumped up performance - to put it mildly - to produce stunning comebacks from 7-4 and 11-8 down, Anderson's attempts to stage a similar response from deficits of 5-0, 8-2 and 13-7 were thwarted as soon as they began.</p>

      <p>The Welshman, who was favourite heading into the contest due to a vastly superior <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/price-beats-ratajski-in-heated-final/172349">season</a> in which he'd won <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/price-beats-ratajski-in-heated-final/172349">four individual titles</a> compared to Anderson's zero, didn't even need to be at his very best either as he averaged a fairly mediocre 95.64 by his standards compared to his opponent's 91.37.</p>
      <p>The damage was done in the opening five legs, as a rusty Flying Scotsman allowed Price to whitewash him in the mini session despite not managing better than a 14-darter - and that stat hadn't even changed by the time the 34-year-old moved 10-6 ahead with a 19-darter.</p>
      <p>Eventually Price found a higher gear with 13 and 11-dart legs in the next three while a 109 checkout gave him a 15-9 lead that was soon turned into a one-sided victory.</p>
      <p>The defending champion, who also defeated Anderson in their other meeting this year at the <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/aspinall-wins-us-darts-masters/168637">US Darts Masters</a>, hit three more 180s with seven and converted 15 of his 37 attempts at doubles as Anderson spurned 21 of his 30.</p>
      <p>Next up for Price in the semi-finals is a man he's never beaten in 19 previous attempts - a certain Michael van Gerwen.</p>
      <h3>Van Gerwen hits the Jackpot</h3>
      <p>Adrian Lewis' resurgence was stopped firmly in its tracks by yet another formidable display from Michael van Gerwen.</p>
      <p>Jackpot was appearing in his first televised quarter-final since 2017 thanks to a morale-boosting run at the Aldersley Leisure Village but his worst performance of the week was severely punished as he slipped to a heavy 16-6 defeat before offering apologetic gestures to the crowd.</p>
      <p>Lewis averaged just 86.26 in a match which was billed as a potential blast from the past - and even one which might signal a further stride in the right direction from the two-time world champion - while the current <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/mvg-wins-third-world-title/156769">Ally Pally king</a> recorded a mark of 103.05 that would have been much higher had he not missed 29 darts at doubles.</p>

      <p>Percentage-wise, the Stoke thrower's finishing was even worse as he spurned 19 of his 25 attempts while he hit four fewer 180s with seven and his highest checkout of 57 was small fry compared to MVG's 132 on the bullseye that completed a 12-darter for a 6-1 lead.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman, who is chasing his 14th title of the season and sixth major having also scooped the <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/mvg-wins-fifth-masters-title/158096">Masters</a>, <b><a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/premier-league-finals-night-recap/166893">Premier League</a>, <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/mvg-reigns-again-in-dublin/172710">World Grand Prix</a>,</b> <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/mvg-stuns-wright-in-final/172996">Champions League</a> and <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/mvg-wins-50th-individual-tv-title/173626">World Series of Darts Finals</a>, moved 8-2 ahead with an 11-darter as he threatened an average in excess of 110 only for a mid-game slump - relatively speaking - to bring his numbers down.</p>
      <p>The dip was never enough to motivate Lewis into a comeback charge and 10-4 was the closest he'd get before MVG sped away into the last four.</p>
      <p>Van Gerwen will start as hot favourite to extend his unbeaten run over Price to a 20th match on Sunday afternoon before taking on either Peter Wright or Glen Durrant in the final.</p>
