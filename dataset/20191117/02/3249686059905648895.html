      <p><b><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/kim-jun-ho">Kim Jun Ho</a></b> talked about comments that he remembered.</p>
      <p>During the November 16th episode of <b>tvN</b>'s '<b>Don Quixote</b>' the members talked about the comments of the new show. <b>Song Jin Woo</b> said, "<i>When our teaser went out, 99.9% of the comments are about <b>Lee Jin Hyuk</b>. He's the one that leads us.</i>"</p>
      <p>Kim Jun Ho said, "<i>There were comments about me, too. Someone said, 'He's crawling back out, huh?' It kind of hurt me. Because I'm blatantly coming back.</i>"</p>
      <p>However, despite what Kim Jun Ho jokes about, most netizens are on Kim Jun Ho's side and believe there was an unnecessary fuss created just in an attempt to cover up <b>Jung Joon Young</b>'s scandal. It's good to see him on screen again!</p>
