      <p>Meet Annie McDonald. She's 23, a newly graduated high school teacher - and the 2019 Dungog Showgirl.</p>
      <p>Annie was sashed at the Dungog Show earlier this month and will now go on to represent the area in the zone finals next year.</p>
      <p>Annie comes from a great showgirl pedigree with her mum Kathy having won the title in 1989 and sister Prue taking out the title in 2014 and going all the way to the Sydney finals.</p>
      <p>Annie said entering the showgirl competition was a great way for her to become even more involved in the show and promote its values.</p>
      <p>"I've been an unofficial member of the ladies auxiliary since I was born," she laughed.</p>
      <p>"I've always had some part to play in the show whether it be making sandwiches for the workers or climbing up and helping hang quilts up in the exhibitions.</p>
      <p>"(The Showgirl competition) is about being an ambassador for the community and promoting agriculture and helping put a spotlight in women in rural communities."</p>
      <p>The former Dungog High School student has just completed her teaching degree and has already secured a temporary contract to teach English and modern history at Kotara High. She has her sights set on teaching in a rural school.</p>
      <p>Annie praised her fellow showgirl contestants Chelsea Greentree and Miracle Urban.</p>
      <p>"I was so lucky to be a part of the showgirl event with these incredible two women," she said.</p>
      <p>Annie will not have to travel too far for the next stage of the competition with the zone event to be held at Tocal in February next year. The finals of the Land Showgirl competition will be at the Sydney Royal Easter Show.</p>
