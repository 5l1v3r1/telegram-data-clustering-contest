      <p>It is said that when beggars die, there are no comets seen, but the heavens themselves blaze forth at the death of princes. Brigadier-General Mobolaji Johnson was a prince among men. The heavens have not only blazed forth. They have opened up and the tributes have been pouring ever since the much admired and beloved soldier’s passing a few weeks back.</p>
      <p>Tall, poised, polished, supremely good looking, exuding charm and good breeding, Mobolaji Johnson was quite a pleasant revelation in the early days of military rule and a great advertisement for the arms-bearing profession. He was the archetypal Lagosian gentleman who wears his Edwardian hat and opinion lightly. Looking back, it is hard to believe that he was not born into the uppermost crust of the coastal aristocracy.</p>
      <p>Such was the upper class grace with which he conducted himself and the nobility with which he discharged his obligations. Johnson showed that for a thinking officer, the last order is not always the last order. In the long run, it is what your conscience makes of the last order that matters. He was a soldier and a statesman.</p>
      <p>General Johnson’s public career as a military administrator can be interrogated with a famous Yoruba saying which holds that when people are sent on an errand meant for slaves, they must deliver the message with the honour and proud dignity of the freeborn.</p>
      <p>The late officer belongs to a special breed of soldiers who suddenly found themselves in civil governance without being trained or prepared for it. But having found themselves in a no man’s land, they discharged their responsibilities with the highest distinction.</p>
      <p>It must be remembered that soldiers are not trained to be civil or unduly sentimental in the discharge of their professional obligations. Theirs is to obey orders and to achieve a set objective with whatever means possible and without any consideration for collateral damage. The situation is often compounded if the military in contention has its originating summons in a colonial army of occupation.</p>
      <p>With considerable emotional intelligence, native sensitivity and consideration for the plight of others, Johnson was able to domesticate this harsh and brutal military ethos into a code of humane conduct in civil administration.  Those that couldn’t do so fell into the infamy of military misrule and are remembered in popular narratives for their brutality and sadistic misconduct.</p>
      <p>Although he ruled very much under the shadow and might of a federal government, Johnson succeeded in carving a niche for himself as a remarkable and civilized military administrator.  The Lagos-born soldier was a lowly major when he was tipped for the post of military administrator for the capital territory by the short-lived regime of General Thomas Aguiyi-Ironsi.</p>
      <p>Johnson was retained by the then Lieutenant Colonel Yakubu Gowon after the bloody coup that toppled the Ironsi regime.  After the creation of states on the eve of the Nigerian civil war, he was made full military governor of the newly created Lagos State, a post he held down for eight years until Gowon himself was toppled in a military putsch in August, 1975.</p>
      <p>In all, Johnson ruled Lagos for a whopping nine years, the longest serving military administrator in the history of the country, rising through the military ladder to become a one star general and wisely keeping out of high-wire military politics and deadly power play until his number came up. In the event, Lagos was his first and last posting.</p>
      <p>The love, respect and admiration shown to General Johnson during his lifetime by his Yoruba compatriots and the outpouring of grief and public display of emotions on his passing betray a fundamental ambivalence about Yoruba attitude to the military profession which is at the heart of their culture and cosmology.</p>
      <p>Although they respect and admire the soldering profession, considering arms bearers as the protectors and custodians of the realm, they often view military irruption into politics and statecraft with loathing and apprehension, an example of forcible gate crashing into a sphere of life for which they were ill-suited and ill-prepared.</p>
      <p>In the old Oyo Empire, the top military commanders were usually restricted to remote outposts, never to be seen within the precincts of the capital except when they were on routine consultations. The political mess made of empire by the Afonja rebellion which opened the door into a maelstrom of intrigues and military treachery that eventually led to the liquidation of the most ambitious Yoruba political project ever remains evergreen in the people’s political and cultural memory.</p>
      <p>Consequently, the contemporary romance among the Yoruba people with military civility, polish and courtesy as encoded in the ethos of omoluabi  can be interpreted as a backhanded compliment which comes with a typically Yoruba double-edged ambiguity. It is another way of saying, look folks, we do not know or appreciate what you are doing here, but it can be tolerated as long as you do it with a measure of courtesy and good manners, and with brisk dispatch.</p>
      <p>Almost without exception, the Yoruba military sons their people admire most are usually imbued with a high degree of polish, courtesy and civility. For a people of empire, this disdain for martial swashbuckling and overbearing military arrogance is strange and confounding to say the least. But it may well be a way of organizing an open society based on conciliation and compromise rather than armed intimidation.</p>
      <p>Perhaps it also speaks poignantly to the abiding trauma of a people who have been continuously embroiled in wars for almost three centuries, the last one a nasty series of civil wars which lasted for almost a century and only ended when the colonial authorities drove the combatants away from the front by which time the hostilities had stalemated into fitful exchanges of artillery volleys from newly acquired maxim guns.</p>
      <p>Whatever it is, the Yoruba aversion for rampart militarism has its manifest disadvantages. It has led the Yoruba holding the short end of the stick in the brutal coliseum that is the post-colonial garrison nation.  In this political gymnasium, power flows from the fixed bayonets and the control of all military and paramilitary institutions of the state and their security apparatuses.</p>
      <p>The power pragmatists of modern Nigeria, reaping bounteous rewards of insight from their own background of conquest and domination of diverse people in their region, came to the conclusion quite early that force is the centralizing glue for any nation of diverse nationalities with countervailing and mutually unintelligible political cultures.</p>
      <p>Without the express and manifest backing of this feudal military complex, the Yoruba nation in post-independence Nigeria has seen its leading sons repeatedly thwarted at the last post. The endgame has always been the same: humiliation, imprisonment or outright murder.</p>
      <p>The only exception to the rule has been General Olusegun Obasanjo, a man of extraordinary native cunning and intelligence who bested the power masters at their own game. But Obasanjo himself owes his luck to a dramatic and miraculous reprieve from the Gulag of the politically expired and expendable after humiliation and imprisonment by his erstwhile military subordinates. Yoruba sons hoping to rule Nigeria after the Buhari era must take note of this fascist terror machine.</p>
      <p>Yet it should now be obvious that this insistence on holding a society down by feudal force and sheer military terror has its downside. It leads to economic stultification, the liquidation of human creative spirit and rising political inequality which turns a society into a roiling hell on earth as a result of fierce spiritual, economic, political rebellion and armed critiques. This is the lot of northern Nigeria today and the virus is being insinuated to the rest of the country.</p>
      <p>It has been concluded by modern sociologists that greater equality makes a society stronger and more economically productive. This is why the western parts of the nation with their liberality and tolerance and despite military setbacks and occasional political hostilities among its fractious elite, remain the most economically productive and politically advanced segment of the nation.</p>
      <p>It is to the eternal credit of General Mobolaji Johnson that he was able to tap into this abiding cultural habitus of his people without making any fuss or fanfare about it. By so doing, he was able to run an open and inclusive government, avoiding the banana peels of what is known in local parlance as military gra-gra while opting for governance based on consensus, compromise and conciliation.  His handling of the Coker controversy remains a template of elite conciliation, fair-mindedness and unblemished integrity.</p>
      <p>Nobility must have its obligation. Mobolaji Johnson was also very much a man of the people, with his housing and transportation schemes remaining a lasting legacy of charity and humane compassion for the poor and downtrodden of the society. The people reciprocated with love and affection. The late local musical gadfly and hell raiser, Ayinla Omo-Wura, aka Eegunmagaji, waxed an Apala classic in support of his housing programme which resonates till date.</p>
      <p>In retirement Johnson remained a model gentleman and quintessential omoluabi, opting to live in the quiet suburb of Ilupeju rather than the swanky highbrow areas of Lagos Island. Public admiration and respect for him soared after a military board of inquiry absolved him of any wrongdoing or corrupt practices while in office. May the soul of this great compatriot rest in perfect peace.</p>
