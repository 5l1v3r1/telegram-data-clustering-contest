      <h1>Georgia Issues Promising Update On Injured Photographer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T02:08:56+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 02:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, the dangers of working the sideline during college football games were highlighted during a game between No. 12 Auburn and No. 4 Georgia.</p>
      <p>Bulldogs running back Brian Herrien, after gaining a few yards on a pass, was pushed out of bounds and collided with a school photographer for his team.</p>
      <p>Video of the play showed the <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/auburn-georgia-photographer-sideline-knocked-unconscious">student was knocked unconscious</a>. She remained motionless on the field for several minutes as medical personnel tended to her.</p>
      <p>The photographer, later identified as Chamberlain Smith, was stretchered off the field and taken to a local hospital.</p>
      <p>Sideline reporter Jamie Erdahl reported the somber scene when it happened. However, a few hours later, she was able to reveal some good news.</p>
      <p>“Just heard good news from Georgia Athletics! The young woman, Chamberlain Smith, who was knocked unconscious on the sideline will be released from the hospital later this evening. A UGA grad and photographer intern for the athletic department,” she said.</p>

      <p>It’s great to hear she’s doing well, especially given the video footage of the play.</p>
      <p>Georgia went on the win the game, 21-14, though Auburn gave the Bulldogs a scare down the stretch. The Bulldogs moved to 9-1 on the season and kept their College Football Playoff hopes alive.</p>
