      <p>The Kogi State Governor and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahaya_Bello">Yahaya Bello</a>, has defeated his closest rivals, Musa Wada of the PDP and Natasha Akpoti of SDP, in Okene Local Government Area of Kogi Central.</p>
      <p>The governor polled 112,764 votes to defeat Ms Akpoti of the SDP and Mr Wada of the PDP who both scored 50 and 139 votes respectively.</p>
      <p>The result from the local government was signed by the collation officer of the local government, Olanrewaju Samuel, an associate professor.</p>
      <p>The local governmentâ€™s results is expected to be strongly contested as it claims none of the PDP or SDP could poll a total of 200 votes in all the polling units in the local government.</p>
      <p>Okene local government is part of Kogi Central senatorial district. Ms Akpoti had criticised the conduct of the election in the senatorial district saying no real election took place there.</p>
