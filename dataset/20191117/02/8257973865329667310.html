      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T02:10:35+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 02:10</time> by <a rel="author">Christen McCurdy</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 16 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Prince_Andrew/?tps=1">Prince Andrew</a> has denied accusations of sexual misconduct by one of <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jeffrey_Epstein/?tps=1">Jeffrey Epstein</a>'s accusers in an interview aired Saturday, but admits having stayed at the deceased financier's home after Epstein was convicted of sexual offenses.</p>
      <p>Andrew, who was named in court papers as part of a 2015 civil case against Epstein, said he has "no recollection" of meeting the woman who has accused him of forcing her to have sex with him three times -- once when she was 17 -- between 2001 and 2002. Virginia Roberts, now Virginia Guiffre, said she was forced to have sex with the prince in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein.</p>
      <p>Those accusations were later struck from the court record by a judge who said they were immaterial to the case's central claim.</p>
      <p>"I have no recollection of meeting this lady, none whatsoever," Andrew said <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50431163">in a BBC interview</a> taped Thursday that aired Saturday night.</p>
      <p>A photograph of Andrew with his arm around Roberts' waist has been published widely, but the prince told the BBC <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/16/prince-andrew-denies-sex-with-teenager-as-at-home-after-pizza-party">he was at home eating pizza at the time</a>.</p>
      <p>Another woman has accused Andrew of groping her in Manhattan's apartment.</p>
      <p>In 2015, when <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Buckingham_Palace/?tps=1">Buckingham Palace</a> issued a statement denying "any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors."</p>
      <p>Questions have swirled around the accusation and around Andrew's relationship to Epstein for the last several months. This week Buckingham Palace and Andrew's former wife, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Sarah_Ferguson/?tps=1">Sarah Ferguson</a>, made public statements denying any misconduct claims.</p>
      <p>In this week's interview, he admitted to staying at Epstein's house after he was aware of Epstein's conviction on sex abuse charges in 2008, stemming from a 2005 accusation by a 14-year-old girl in Florida.</p>
      <p>"I stayed with him and that's the bit that as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the Royal family, and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that," Andrew said.</p>
