      <h1>Nebraska’s Wan’Dale Robinson Has Message For Huskers Fans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:45:39+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Nebraska played better on Saturday, but the Huskers were still incapable of pulling out a victory at home against Wisconsin. Scott Frost’s team fell, 37-21, to drop to 4-6 on the season.</p>
      <p>The Huskers were without star freshman Wan’Dale Robinson, who missed the game with an injury.</p>
      <p>Robinson has been one of the team’s lone bright spots this season. He posted a message for Huskers fans following the game, asking them to be patient.</p>
      <p>“We’ll get this thing turned around, stay patient,” he tweeted.</p>

      <p>Nebraska is certainly going to give head coach Scott Frost time to get this thing turned around. The Huskers announced a two-year contract extension for Frost prior to kickoff. He’s now under contract through the 2026 season.</p>
      <p>“He is the guy for the long haul and we needed to do this right. I still think we are on schedule and a couple of years away from being where we need to be,” <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/nebraska-ad-message-huskers-fans-about-scott-frost">Nebraska athletics director Bill Moos said</a>.</p>
      <p>Nebraska will look to finish strong against Maryland and Iowa and make a bowl game.</p>
