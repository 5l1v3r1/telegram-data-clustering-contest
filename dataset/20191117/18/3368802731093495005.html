      <h1>Defaulters can now apply for fresh loans</h1>
      <h2>Need to make 15pc down payment</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>Defaulters eligible for easy rescheduling facility will also be allowed to take out fresh loans by providing a down payment of 15 percent of their outstanding loans -- a development that has drawn the ire of different quarters.</p>
      <p>The development comes after the central bank yesterday issued a notice in line with a verdict given by the High Court on November 4.</p>
      <p>Prior to that, the central bank asked banks on September 3 to suspend fresh loan disbursement to defaulters following another High Court order.</p>
      <p>As per the relaxed central bank policy issued on May 16, defaulters will be allowed to reschedule their classified loans by making a down payment of only 2 percent instead of the existing 10-50 percent.</p>
      <p>A maximum 9 percent interest will be charged on the rescheduled loans while the existing interest rate is 12-16 percent.</p>
      <p>Besides, the tenure for repayment is 10 years with a grace period of one year.</p>
      <p>As per the latest central bank notice, banks will have to adjust the 15 percent down payment with their outstanding loans.</p>
      <p>This means defaulters who enjoy the relaxed facility will have to give down payments twice.</p>
      <p>The High Court and the central bank gave the instruction in accordance with the master notice on loan rescheduling issued in 2012 by the Bangladesh Bank.</p>
      <p>The central bank also extended the easy rescheduling facility for another 90 days since yesterday.</p>
      <p>The relaxed facility has drawn huge criticism from different corners as they think that it will bring no good for the banking sector.</p>
      <p>Rather, this will heighten indiscipline in the banking sector as the policy will encourage habitual defaulters.</p>
      <p>A number of senior bankers wishing not to named yesterday told The Daily Star that they have adopted a cautious policy on the issue.</p>
      <p>Banks have already received plenty of applications to reschedule default loans under the relaxed policy, they said.</p>
      <p>But, there will be little chance to extend fresh credit facility to the habitual defaulters, they said.</p>
      <p>Good clients, however, will be considered for fresh loans, according to them.</p>
      <p>Banks went on a loan rescheduling spree in the first half of this year to arrest default loans, according to data from the central bank.</p>
      <p>Between the months of January and June loans amounting to Tk 21,308 crore were rescheduled, which is almost thrice the amount rescheduled a year earlier. Loans amounting to Tk 7,338 crore were rescheduled in the first half of 2018.</p>
      <p>Banks failed to bring down delinquent loans in the period: default loans in the banking sector stood at Tk 112,425 crore, up 19.71 percent from six months earlier.  </p>
