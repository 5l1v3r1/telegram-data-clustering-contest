      <p>Paris - French Top 14 leaders Lyon came crashing down to earth at Franklin's Gardens on Sunday as they slipped to a 25-14 defeat in their opening European Champions Cup Pool 1 match against Northampton.</p>
      <p>French spirits took a double dip as Montpellier were squeezed 23-20 by Connacht in their Pool 5 encounter in Galway.</p>
      <p>Northampton, winners in 2000, opened up a 19-0 lead at half-time thanks to a converted Rory Hutchinson try and four penalties from Dan Biggar.</p>
      <p>But in a fractious second half which saw the game interrupted on several occasions by outbreaks of fighting, Lyon began to show their worth with replacement centre Thibaut Regard crashing over twice.</p>
      <p>Lyon were denied a defensive bonus point, however, by two further penalties from Biggar who finished with a personal haul of 20 points.</p>
      <p>Montpellier took the early initiative against Connacht with former All Black Aaron Cruden going over for a try in the first minute.</p>
      <p>The home side hit back with a penalty from Jack Carty and two tries just before half-time from flank Paul Boyle and hooker Tom McCartney.</p>
      <p>Trailing 13-10 at the break, Montpellier levelled through a Benoit Paillaugue penalty but Connacht soon pounced for their third try as scrumhalf Caolin Blade darted through a gap close to the French line.</p>
      <p>With 15 minutes remaining, Montpellier drew level again at 20-20, Anthony Bouthier getting the better of McCartney to sprint through, Paillaugue adding the extras.</p>
      <p>Four minutes later replacement flyhalf Conor Fitzgerald converted another penalty and Connacht clung on for the win.</p>
      <p>The result means all four Irish provinces won on the opening weekend of the Champions Cup.</p>
