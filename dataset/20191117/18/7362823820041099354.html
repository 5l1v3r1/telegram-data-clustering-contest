      <h1>'Investigation' of the Bidens needed, Gregg Jarrett says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:56:50+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:56</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Givas</a></address>
      <p>There should be a federal investigation into <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">2020 presidential</a> hopeful <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a>, and his son Hunter, to determine if they set up a quid-pro-quo agreement with the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine">Ukraine</a> government in an effort to engage in pay-to-play politics, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/j/gregg-jarrett">Gregg Jarrett</a> said Saturday.</p>
      <p>Jarrett appeared on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/watters-world">Watters' World</a>" to discuss the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/ted-lieu-hunter-biden-ukraine">$50,000-a-month</a> salary Hunter Biden was receiving as a board member of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings, and the attempts by his father to stifle an investigation.</p>
      <p>"No reasonable person who actually looks at the evidence believes that this wasn’t a quid pro quo that may well have been designed just to benefit Hunter Biden," he said, "which would make it a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</p>
      <p>"There needs to be an investigation," he continued. "Compare that to the quid pro quo that doesn’t exist in the [Trump-Ukraine call] -- a transcript of which we have, between Trump and [Ukraine President Volodymyr] Zelensky. There’s no demand, there's no threat, there's no condition -- and the fact that Zelensky himself says, 'there was no quid pro quo, I didn’t even know about it.' It’s impossible for there to be a quid pro quo if the recipient of the quid is oblivious to the quo."</p>
      <p>The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits U.S. bribes to foreign officials in connection with business deals.</p>

      <p>Jarrett commented on congressional <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/democrats">Democrats</a> switching their terminology from "quid pro quo" to "bribe" during the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">Trump impeachment</a> inquiry, and claimed there must be an element of quid pro quo for bribery to exist.</p>
      <p>He also claimed former President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/barack-obama">Barack Obama</a>'s nuclear deal with Iran was a more accurate example of bribery than any of the charges being made against Trump.</p>

      <p>"What [House Speaker] <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/nancy-pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a> doesn’t realize, because she’s not a lawyer is -- bribery is quid pro quo," he added.</p>
      <p>"So, without a quid pro quo, there’s no bribery. I’ll tell you what smacks more of bribery -- Obama delivering a pallet of cash to the Iranians in exchange for signing a nuclear deal that helped him politically."</p>
