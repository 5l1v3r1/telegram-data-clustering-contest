      <h1>DraftKings Week 11 Monday Night Showdown: Picks, advice for Chiefs vs. Chargers NFL DFS</h1>

      <p>Chiefs vs. Chargers takes place at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, usually home of the Mexican national soccer team. So, our Week 11 DraftKings Monday Night Football Showdown lineup features not just onebut two kickers (the elevation is 2,000 feet higher than Mile High in Denver). That includes Michael Badgley as our DFS captain andHarrison Butker as well. By using two kickers, we can plug four studs into our lineup, including Patrick Mahomes and Philip Rivers.</p>
      <p>There's a couple obvious, high-ownership plays in this game with Mahomes and Melvin Gordon. The two kickers might create some variation for us from those common lineups and allow us to have a shot at winning a tournament.</p>
      <h3>DraftKings Showdown Picks: Chiefs vs. Chargers</h3>
      <p>
        <b>CAPTAIN (1.5x points, 1.5x price): K Michael Badgley, Chargers ($5,700)</b>
      </p>
      <p>If we're leaning on one offense to stall out more often, it's the Chargers. Badgley has as good of a leg as Butker, and the thin air will be his best friend. You'll have a super unique captain pick by going with a kicker, and it's more of a built-in floor than other players at this price point.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FLEX: QB Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs ($12,000)</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is a no-brainer. It's not worth fading Mahomes with the level of upside that he has. He also might throw the ball 100 yards in the air at this elevation.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FLEX: WR Tyreek Hill, Chiefs ($10,600)</b>
      </p>
      <p>You could choose to try Travis Kelce as your Mahomes stack, but Hill is more likely to hit on a couple of the home run balls that make a tournament-winning score.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FLEX: QB Philip Rivers, Chargers ($8,800)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Chiefs' defense hasn't been good. L.A. will have to score points to stay in this game, which means that Rivers should get to sling it around sidearm for four quarters. We're less confident whether Keenan Allen, Mike Williams or Hunter Henry will be the main beneficiary, so we'll just use Rivers to capture it all.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FLEX: RB Melvin Gordon, Chargers ($8,600)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Derrick Henry gashed the Kansas City run defense last week. Gordon's seen 20-plus carries two weeks running. He should probably be pricier than Rivers given the matchup, so we'll gladly take him. You could also use Keenan Allen here if you had a desire to stay away from the L.A. running game for some reason.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FLEX: K Harrison Butker, Chiefs ($4,000)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yup, both kickers. With four players likely to be highly owned, the double kicker combo should create the differentiation we need to get over the top.</p>
