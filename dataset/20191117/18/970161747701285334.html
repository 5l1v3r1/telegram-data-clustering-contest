      <p>A family has been ‘put off’ shopping at Iceland again after receiving a pizza covered in black mould.</p>
      <p>Kim Bann says her niece ordered the Iceland own-brand Deep Pan Double Pepperoni pizza from the Selsdon branch last Friday.</p>
      <p>However, Kim got a shock when she found ‘disgusting’ black mould ‘all the way round it’ when she opened it for her daughter’s lunch.</p>
      <p>Kim said: ‘This is meant to be a double pepperoni pizza but it’s all black mould all the way round it</p>
      <p>‘Absolutely disgusting.’</p>
      <p>The family claim to have been offered a refund for the pizza which normally costs £1.</p>
      <p>However, they say this is ‘appalling’ customer service, given the shock they experienced.</p>

      <p>Kim said: ‘I would have thought that they would least give her a voucher to coax her back to shopping there.</p>

      <p>‘It’s actually put her off shopping there now as well as me.’</p>
      <p>Iceland confirmed to The Sun they had been contacted on social media by Kim and her niece.</p>
      <p>However, they said they were waiting for the account holder to speak to them directly so they can investigate further.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said: ‘At Iceland, we pride ourselves on both the quality of our food and the quality of our service. On this occasion, our customer has clearly not received this usual high standard of experience.</p>
      <p>‘We are very keen to look into this matter further and to ensure that this customer feels valued and understands that she is important she is to Iceland.’</p>
      <p>Metro.co.uk has contacted Iceland for further comment.</p>
