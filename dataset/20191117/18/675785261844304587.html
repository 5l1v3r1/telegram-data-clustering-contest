      <h1>Probe into death of three-year-old boy who died at 'super hospital'</h1>
      <h2>The boy was being treated at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital where Milly Main, 10 died after she is believed to have contracted a 'dirty water infection'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:09:37+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:09</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Morrow, Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Authorities have launched an investigation into the death of a toddler at a hospital in Scotland.</p>
      <p>The three-month-old boy died in the so-called 'super hospital' in August 2017.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Fatalities Investigations Unit (SFIU) is probing the death of the child at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.</p>
      <p>His death came just three weeks before 10-year-old <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/heartbroken-mum-reveals-child-cancer-20889570">Milly Main</a> died after it's believed she contracted a dirty water infection, reports the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/death-toddler-glasgow-super-hospital-20899713">Daily Record</a>.</p>
      <p>Her mum said that her little girl caught the lethal bug when she was in remission for cancer and was preparing her return to the family home.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Crown Office told <a href="https://stv.tv/news/west-central/1442454-three-year-old-s-death-at-super-hospital-investigated/?fbclid=IwAR3h-cyc5L9AdKbA1DJQiCPZfQfS7OA1niCoI8iD-lnM9NYTJfI1o4sHP7o">STV</a> : “The Procurator Fiscal has received a report in connection with the death of a three-year-old boy at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital on August 9, 2017.</p>

      <p>"The investigation into the death, under the direction of Scottish Fatalities Investigation Unit (SFIU), is ongoing and the family will continue to be kept updated in relation to any significant developments."</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-health-board-not-fit-20894432">number of other young people were reportedly infected by the water supply at the Glasgow hospital campus</a>, which includes the Royal Hospital for Children (RHC).</p>
      <p>One report released earlier this year had shown that 23 children with cancer had acquired infections linked to the water supply in two wards at RHC.</p>
      <p>The bacteria stenotrophomonas, which is found in water, was linked to 12 of the cases.</p>
      <p>However, as revealed by the Daily Record, a whistleblower approached Labour MSP <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/anas-sarwar">Anas Sarwar</a> and alleged that an internal doctor-led inquiry focusing on 2017 found another 26 cases.</p>
      <p>The MSP for Glasgow said the NHSGGC was ‘not longer fit for purpose’ and called for the health body to be put into “special measures”.</p>
      <p>He previously said: “The Glasgow health board has unforgivably let down patients and staff.</p>

      <p>“There are still dozens of families who don’t know the truth about infection contracted in the QUEH.</p>
      <p>“This only came to light following the brave actions of an <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nhs-scotland">NHS</a> whistleblower.</p>
      <p>“But rather than seek answers for patients and the public, the health board has resorted to attacking the whistleblower, threatening and intimidating them.</p>
      <p>“This is a clear attempt to silence staff from speaking out, and prevent the truth being heard by the public.</p>
      <p>“Who is signing off these insulting statements being issued by the health board and are they being cleared by the Health Secretary?</p>
      <p>“The Scottish Government must now step in and put the health board into special measures, so that ministers take control, staff can speak out in confidence they will not lose their jobs, and – most importantly - parents can learn the truth.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-health-board-not-fit-20894432">NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde</a> is not fit for purpose.”</p>

      <p>NHSGGC has said it is not possible to link cases of stenotrophomonas infection in 2017 to the water supply as tests were not carried out on the supply at the time.</p>
      <p>It said it was "extremely disappointing" that a whistle-blower has made this claim, causing "additional distress to families and to other families of cancer patients".</p>
      <p>An NHSGGC spokeswoman said: "We have already provided information to this family but are sorry that they have further questions.</p>
      <p>"We fully investigated this child's death at the time and also asked for two independent experts to investigate the case, the outcome of which has been communicated to the family.</p>

      <p>"We are absolutely committed to providing patients and families with information and ensuring they get answers to the questions they have.</p>
      <p>"In this case the full findings were shared with the family."</p>
      <p>On the issue of Milly Main's death, the health board said it was not obliged to test for bloodstream infection stenotrophomonas - listed as a possible cause on the child's death certificate - at the time of her death and therefore could not determine whether the infection was linked to the hospital's water supply.</p>
      <p>The health board said it has offered to meet Milly's family and said water in the hospital is safe and has been independently assessed as such.</p>
      <p>A Police Scotland spokesman said: "A report was submitted to the procurator fiscal in connection with the death of a three-year-old boy at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in 2017."</p>
