      <h1>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain convinces England but Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp must come next</h1>
      <h2>The Liverpool midfielder has hit a rich vein of form in the last month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:11:44+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/elliott-jackson/" target="_blank">Elliott Jackson</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal and Tottenham legends Lee Dixon and Glenn Hoddle have both stressed that <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/alex-oxlade-chamberlain">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> must start for England at the EUROS if fit.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> midfielder produced an eye-catching performance on Thursday night during the Three Lions' 7-0 win over Montenegro.</p>
      <p>That was Oxlade-Chamberlain's first international start in 19 months after recovering from the serious knee injury that sidelined him for almost the entirety of the 2018/19 season.</p>
      <p>With five goals in his last seven games for club and country, Oxlade-Chamberlain is firmly banging on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp's</a> door for a regular starting berth at Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Having impressed in the Champions League and the Carabao Cup it seems like only a matter of time before the Englishman breaks into their Premier League team on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>"As a midfield player he presses well, he makes run in-behind defences, he can score goals and he can create goals with a pass or a cross. He fits that berth perfectly," Gareth Southgate said, who is clearly a huge fan of Oxlade-Chamberlain.</p>
      <p>He is not the only one.</p>
      <p>Both Dixon and Hoddle have insisted that Oxlade-Chamberlain must start for England as he gives the best balance to their midfield, an area Southgate is still trying to find the perfect blend in.</p>
      <p>"Without any shadow of a doubt (he could start)," Hoddle told ITV.</p>
      <p>"You look at his attributes, he's got legs, he can get back and defend, he can get in-behind defences and beyond the striker.</p>
      <p>"That wonderful ingredient that all the best midfielders have got, he can score goals and create. He's got the perfect balance of play to play in the number eight role, which I think Gareth is looking at.</p>
      <p>"Two eights and one holder. For me, he'll look for someone to balance off that and if he's fit, he'll be in there for sure."</p>
      <p>Dixon added: "I think some players mature on the pitch, he's had the opportunity, although he wouldn't have picked it, to mature off the pitch. He's watched a lot of football, he's come through those moments of trying to get fit three or four times.</p>
      <p>"I saw him play three or four years, maybe five years ago, in the centre of midfield in the deeper role against AC Milan in the Champions League and he ran the show.</p>
      <p>"He is intelligence, his ability on the ball to knock that ball and I think England have missed that ability to knock the ball behind and also be the man who runs in-behind. He's got everything for me."</p>
      <p>Even former Manchester United captain Roy Keane has been impressed, although he insisted Oxlade-Chamberlain must break into the Liverpool team to be at his best for England.</p>
      <p>"He comes across brilliant, doesn't he? He appreciates the game despite the bad injuries he's had. Sometimes you'll count your blessing a little more when you're back.</p>
      <p>"Gareth (Southgate) is a big fan and he comes across as a really nice character. The key for him he has to get games at club level. He has to get in that Liverpool team and play regular games particularly for the bigger games in the summer.</p>
      <p>"You can only be consistent when you're playing week in, week out."</p>
