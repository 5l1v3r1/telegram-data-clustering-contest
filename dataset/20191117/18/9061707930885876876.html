      <h1>New Derbyshire care home will have boat house and canal view</h1>
      <h2>It will have 60 beds</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:09:21+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:09</time> by <a rel="author">Eddie Bisknell</a></address>
      <p>A council has approved plans for a canalside care home – complete with a roof terrace and boat house.</p>
      <p>The application, for the former Royal Oak pub site <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/long-eaton">in Tamworth Road, Long Eaton</a>, was submitted to Erewash Borough Council by Mr S Akhter in spring this year.</p>
      <p>Now council officers have approved the application, which would see a 60-bed care home built on the site alongside the Erewash Canal.</p>
      <p>It is thought that the home would create at least <a href="https://www.fish4.co.uk/jobs/derby/">26 jobs</a>.</p>
      <p>The buildings on the former pub plot were demolished approximately four years ago, after years of being left empty, and the concrete-slabbed site is currently vacant and overgrown.</p>
      <p>Entry to the site would stem off Tamworth Road, with 14 car parking spaces. There would also be two extra spots for disabled parking and for either a light goods vehicle, delivery van or ambulance.</p>
      <p>The side of the building facing Tamworth Road would be three storeys tall, while the rest would be one-storey.</p>

      <p>Included in the approved project are a rooftop terrace, a canalside deck, seating and garden area, a greenhouse and a boat house.</p>
      <p>Each bedroom would have an en-suite bathroom.</p>
      <p>A section of the building which would face the canal, surrounded by a raised deck, would house a lounge and feature a sail-like roof.</p>
      <p>A statement from Zenith Planning Design, included with the application on behalf of the applicant, said: “The proposal will fulfil an economic role by bringing forward the development of a vacant brownfield site and by providing employment during the construction phase.</p>
      <p>“It will fulfil a social role by providing accommodation for elderly residents for which there will be an increasing need owing to the ageing population.</p>
      <p>“It will fulfil an environmental role by improving the appearance of a poor quality site through the erection of a well-designed building which will enhance the appearance of the street scene.</p>
      <p>“The development has been designed to enhance the appearance of the site from the canal and the tow-path on the opposite side of the canal.</p>
      <p>“Some bedrooms and a residents’ lounge will have a direct outlook over the canal and a decking area and garden will provide outdoor amenity space next to the canal.”</p>

      <p>The applicants say that “particular care has been taken to reduce the scale of the building where it adjoins the residential gardens to the north to prevent overshadowing and overlooking”.</p>
      <p>Plans for a 45-bed care home were approved for the site in April 2015 by the same applicant – but this was dropped after “concerns about the viability of a residential care home with only 45 bedrooms”.</p>
      <p>As a result, the number of beds has been increased, with a slight rise in the project’s overall floor space.</p>
