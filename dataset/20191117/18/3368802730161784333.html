      <h1>Café attack verdict on Nov 27</h1>

      <p>A tribunal in Dhaka has set November 27 for delivery of the verdict in a case filed in connection with the Holey Artisan Café attack that left 22 people, including 17 foreigners, dead in 2016.</p>
      <p>All eight accused in the case, now in jail, were produced before the court yesterday when Judge Md Majibur Rahman of the Anti-Terrorism Special Tribunal of Dhaka set the date.</p>
      <p>During closing arguments, the prosecution told the tribunal that they were able to prove the charges against the eight and sought capital punishment for all of them.</p>
      <p>The defence sought acquittals for their clients saying the charges were brought based on confessional statements of six accused which could not be trusted.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the tribunal recorded statements of 113 prosecution witnesses.</p>
      <p>During the trial, several eyewitnesses, including the wife of Hasnat Reza Karim who was a teacher of North South University, owner of the Holey Artisan restaurant, and top police officials narrated their experiences of the incident.</p>
      <p>Hasnat was first shown arrested in the case but was later relieved of the charges following a probe that found no evidence of his involvement.</p>
      <p>On July 1, 2016, armed militants stormed the Holey Artisan Bakery at the diplomatic zone in Dhaka’s Gulshan area. Two police officers were also killed during the 12-hour standoff that followed.</p>
      <p>On July 23 last year, Counter Terrorism &amp; Transnational Crime Unit pressed charges against eight militant suspects who they say wanted to destabilise Bangladesh by initiating the country’s worst-ever terror incident.  </p>
      <p>The charge sheet also said apart from destabilising the country and turning it into a state controlled by terrorists, the suspects wanted to put the government under pressure, make investors and foreign consultants leave the country and destroy the economy.</p>
      <p>The suspects thought if they could kill a large number of foreigners, they would be under local and international spotlight, alongside drawing attention of global terrorist groups, according to the charge sheet.</p>
      <p>The eight accused are: Jahangir Alam alias Rajib Gandhi, alleged recruiter of the café attackers; Rashed alias Rash, one of the alleged planners; Sohel Mahfuz, reported grenade supplier; suspected arms suppliers Mizanur Rahman alias Boro Mizan and Hadisur Rahman Sagor, and Rakibul Islam, so-called religious trainer, and Shahriful Islam Khaled and Mamunur Rashid Ripon.</p>
      <p>On November 26 the same year, the tribunal framed charges against the eight.</p>
