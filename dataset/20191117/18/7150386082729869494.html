      <p>Like father, like son they say and filmmaker <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/karan-johar"><b>Karan Johar</b></a>‘s cute little munchkin Yash proved exactly that at Aaradhya Bachchan’s birthday bash recently. Seen getting a family picture clicked together, Roohi Johar looked too adorable as daddy Karan held onto her while Yash mimicked his father or so the filmmaker claimed.</p>
      <p>Taking to his Instagram handle, Karan shared the party picture which instantly set fans gushing and we don’t blame them. The picture was captioned, “My son is camera shy just like me!!! @natasha.poonawalla (sic).”</p>
