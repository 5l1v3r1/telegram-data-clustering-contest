        <b>Racing 92 rounded off the opening round of the Heineken Champions Cup in style with a 30-10 victory over Saracens in Paris.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was all one-way traffic from the get-go as the French outfit dominated a largely second-string Saracens from start to finish.</p>
      <p>Virimi Vakatawa got Racing off the mark with their first try after nine minutes before Maxime Machenaud added to his earlier penalty to make it 10-0 after 10 minutes.</p>

      <p>Machenaud added a further three points before Teddy Thomas sent the Parisians into dreamland after 27 minutes with a second try.</p>
