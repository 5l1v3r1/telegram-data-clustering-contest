      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:06:33+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:06</time> by <a rel="author">Kayleigh Roberts</a></address>
      <ul>
        <li>Mariah Carey shared an Instagram photo on Sunday that revealed a meeting she and her twins, Moroccan and Monroe, had with power couple <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29573212/blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-instagram-trolling-2019/">Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mariahcarey/">In the photo</a>, Moroccan (who goes by Rocky) is wearing a Deadpool mask. Carey explained in the photo's caption that Rocky "snuck up" on the "unsuspecting couple" to get the picture.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Reynolds was just as starstruck as Rocky though and described the encounter as a "vision board" moment in a comment on the post.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If hanging out with <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/a27322787/mariah-carey-dress-billboard-music-awards-reactions/">Mariah Carey</a> on your bucket list, then you and Ryan Reynolds have something in common. This weekend, Reynolds' "vision board" moment, as he described it, came true, thanks to Carey's son.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a27338688/transcript-mariah-carey-billboard-music-awards-speech/">Carey shared</a> a photo of herself and her <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/news/a13031/its-officially-official-mariah-carey-and-nick-cannon-divorced/">twins, Moroccan and Monroe</a>, posing with Reynolds and his wife, Blake Lively, on Instagram Sunday and it's everything.</p>
      <p>In the photo, Moroccan (who goes by Rocky) is wearing a Deadpool mask and striking a tough pose in front of Reynolds, who, of course, stars as the wise-cracking anti-hero in the <i><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a20694242/blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-deadpool-2-screening/">Deadpool </a></i><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a20694242/blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-deadpool-2-screening/">franchise</a>.</p>
      <p>"Rocky snuck up on an unsuspecting couple wearing a Deadpool mask," Carey wrote in the photo's caption. "Will they ever recover? ðŸ˜‰ðŸ’–."</p>

      <p>The feeling of awe was totally mutual, <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29494483/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-baby-photo/">Reynolds revealed</a> in the photo's comments section.</p>
      <p>"Whoa," he wrote. "My vision board became a photo." The good humans at Comments by Celebs captured the note for posterity.</p>
