        <b>Adam Lallana has become a target for Paris Saint-Germain and could make a shock move to the French champions on a free transfer in the summer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 31-year-old has struggled for game time at Liverpool over the last two years due to injuries and the stiff competition for places in the Reds starting XI.</p>
      <p>The front three of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mohamed-salah/">Mohamed Salah</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/sadio-mane/">Sadio Mane</a> and Roberto Firmino are guaranteed starters, which has forced Lallana to compete with the central midfielders, where there is also a lot of competition, with Jordan Henderson, Fabinho, Georginio Wijnaldum, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/alex-oxlade-chamberlain/">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> and James Milner all battling for places.</p>
      <p>Lallana’s contract expires at the end of the season and he is free to negotiate with club from abroad in January, with six months left on his deal.</p>
      <p>PSG are keen to bring in the England international on a free transfer in the summer, reports the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-midfielder-adam-lallana-psgs-20896197?_ga=2.14127479.1918181173.1574011680-428349243.1572109686">Mirror,</a> as they look to replace Edison Cavani who is heading to LA Galaxy as a replacement for Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</p>

      <p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp spoke in glowing terms about Lallana when he scored the equaliser for the Reds against Manchester United in October, but did not provide any confirmation about where his future lies.</p>
      <p>‘This weekend we had a long talk in general about our situation, and he is completely relaxed and fine and knows how difficult it is at the moment to come into the team,’ said the German.</p>
      <p>‘But he just trains well and he deserved that; it was 25-30 minutes and he had a proper impact. Then scoring a goal… wow! That was really, really nice.</p>
      <p>‘Then the heart rate went up a bit because VAR was involved – but he said he knew it would not be offside, so that was all fine. A wonderful story. A wonderful, wonderful story.’</p>
