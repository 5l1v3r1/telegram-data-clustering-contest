      <p>Shaw slams fifty on return from doping ban as Mumbai win</p>
      <p>Prithvi Shaw made a splendid return to competitive cricket after serving a doping ban, hitting a 39-ball 63 to guide Mumbai to a 83-run win over Assam in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>All eyes were on Shaw, who played his first game after serving a back-dated eight-month suspension by the BCCI for failing a dope test and the pint-sized opener did not disappoint the small crowd at the Wankhede Stadium.</p>
      <p>Shaw, who came in for in-form Jay Bista, struck a blazing half-century and then celebrated in a ‘bat does the talk’ manner.</p>
