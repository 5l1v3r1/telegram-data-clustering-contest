      <p>Harry Kane became the first England player to score in every game in a qualifying campaign as Gareth Southgate’s side beat Kosovo in their final Euro 2020 qualifier.</p>
      <p>The Three Lions secured their place at next summer’s Euros with a 7-0 win over Montenegro and ensured they finished the qualifying campaign on a high with a 4-0 victory over Kosovo on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>Harry Winks’ first England goal put the visitors ahead at the break and Southgate’s charge pulled away from Kosovo in the second-half with Kane, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/marcus-rashford/">Marcus Rashford</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mason-mount/">Mason Mount</a> all getting on the scoresheet.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Kane doubled England’s lead with ten minutes remaining and in doing so became the first England player to score in every game of a qualifying campaign.</p>
      <p>The Tottenham striker also became the first England player in 90 years to score 12 goals in a calendar year.</p>
