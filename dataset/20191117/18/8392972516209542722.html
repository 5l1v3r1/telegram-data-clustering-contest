      <h1>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry 'told to slow down by Buckingham Palace aides'</h1>
      <h2>Couple didn't take much of a break after becoming parents</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:37:33+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:37</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Leigh</a></address>
      <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been urged to "slow down" by royal officials, a newspaper report claims.</p>
      <p>It is thought neither <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/meghan-markle/">Meghan Markle</a> nor <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-harry/">Prince Harry</a> have taken much of a break in a very busy year which has seen them become parents for the first time.</p>
      <p>But despite baby Archie’s arrival in May, aides believe the couple have been following a gruelling work routine.</p>
      <p>They also embarked on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-harry/meghan-and-harry-filmed-documentary-during-africa-tour-with-baby-archie/">a demanding tour of Africa</a> earlier in the autumn and have faced intense press scrutiny over their living arrangements at Frogmore Cottage and decisions surrounding Archie’s Christening.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/">The Sunday Telegraph</a>, close confidantes have been begging both Meghan and Harry to make a change to their pace of life, expressing concerns over busy schedules that can include 8am phone calls.</p>
      <p>"There was no maternity leave, there was no summer break," an unnamed insider is reported to have highlighted to the newspaper.</p>

      <p>The claims come just days after it was reported <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/meghan-markle/harry-and-meghan-have-told-the-queen-they-wont-be-spending-archies-first-christmas-with-her/">the Sussexes will not be attending Sandringham for the traditional royal family Christmas</a>.</p>
      <p>The Sun reckons the couple will remain in Los Angeles with Meghan’s mum Doria Ragland over the festive period - and their extended break could begin in the next few days.</p>

      <p>It is already thought <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/meghan-markle/meghan-and-harry-may-skip-christmas-with-the-queen-and-spend-it-with-doria-in-la/">they will be stateside for Archie’s first Thanksgiving</a>.</p>
      <p>But it seems possible their American break could last several weeks and ensure they are still across the pond for December 25th.</p>
      <p>A source is reported to have told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">the tabloid</a>: "They need some time away to recharge and decide their plans for next year."</p>
      <p>A separate, also unnamed insider is said to have confided to <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/">Hello! magazine</a>: "It's been a hectic year and they are ready to have some downtime."</p>
