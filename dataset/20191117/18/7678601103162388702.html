      <h1>‘Dare to try, dare to change’: Jokowi encourages innovation through comic</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:39:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:39</time> by <a rel="author">Kharishar Kahfi</a></address>
      <p>After repeatedly touching on the issue in official speeches, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has found a new way to highlight the need for change during his second term: comic strips.</p>
      <p>The caption to a comic strip uploaded to Jokowi’s official instagram account <i>@jokowi</i> on Sunday reads “Dare to try. Dare to change” accompanied by a hashtag <i>#JokoMic</i> -- short for “Jokowi Comic”.</p>
      <p>The comic shows a man resembling the President’s figure sitting on a chair while his grandson is playing with toy bricks.</p>

      <p>The next panels of the comic show the child struggling to build a tower using the toy bricks, as the structure keeps collapsing. When his grandson starts to cry, the grandfather consoles the kid and shows him how to build a more stable structure using the toys.</p>
      <p>When they finally build a structure using the toy bricks, the grandson asked his grandfather: “How does <i>Mbah </i>[grandfather] know?”</p>
      <p>The grandfather figure answers: “Never giving up is good. However, if the same way keeps failing, we have to dare to try a new way.”</p>
      <p>It ends with the grandfather repeating his message: “Don’t be afraid to change.”</p>
      <p>The comic was also uploaded to Jokowi’s Twitter account and Facebook page in the form of a 1-minute video showing the illustrated comic.</p>
      <p>However, there was no credit whatsoever to the illustrator.</p>

      <p>The President has repeatedly pushed for change and innovation, especially among his Cabinet members, in order to achieve the promised targets in developing the economy and the country’s human resources. </p>
      <p>After his inauguration for a second term in October, Jokowi said that his administration had to “continue to develop new methods [and] values [to] not get stuck in a monotone routine.”</p>
      <p>“Innovation should not just become knowledge. Innovation should become a culture,” he said in his inauguration speech.</p>
