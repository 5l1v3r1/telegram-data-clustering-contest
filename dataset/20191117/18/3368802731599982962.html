      <p>Boeing and Biman Bangladesh Airlines signed a deal for two 787-9s aircraft, which list at $292.5 million apiece.</p>
      <p>The deal was signed during the Dubai Airshow 2019.</p>
      <p>Biman already has in its fleet four 787-8s of the US plane maker and the new planes would be 20 feet longer.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday joined the opening ceremony of the airshow, one of the largest aviation exhibitions in the world, and enjoyed a flying display.</p>
      <p>The five-day airshow would continue until November 21 at the Dubai World Central (DWC) with the participation of someÂ 1,300 companies from 160 countries.</p>
      <p>Hasina joined at the invitation of Vice President and Prime Minister of UAE, and Ruler of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.</p>
      <p>On her arrival at the venue, she was received by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, also the UAE defence minister.</p>
      <p>Later, she attended dinner hosted by Bangladesh Ambassador to the UAE in her honour.</p>
      <p>Hasina reached Dubai on Saturday night on a four-day official visit.</p>
      <p>The Dubai Airshow, launched in 1989, has turned as a global platform for the aviation industry to sell its new wares, as the public and private sectors meet to discuss new technologies, opportunities, and hurdles facing the industry.</p>
      <p>In 2017, the last aviation exhibition drew 79,380 trade visitors from around the world, which featured 1,200 exhibitors from 63 countries and an order book in excess of $113.8 billion.</p>
