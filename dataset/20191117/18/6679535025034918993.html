      <h2>The new parking system is to ensure zero wait time</h2>

      <p>A FASTag Car Park, touted as the country’s first, has been introduced at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport at Shamshabad, which would now enable passengers and visitors to have a quick entry and exit from the car park zone.</p>
      <p>The facility, taken up in collaboration with the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI),<b> </b>has dedicated FASTag lanes<b> </b>at the entry and exit to ensure zero wait time. It has been started with ICICI and would be rolled out through other major banks gradually while non-FASTag vehicles would continue to use the existing parking system.</p>
      <p>“This new parking system provides for hassle-free and quick movement of vehicles in the parking zone. It is also aligned with the Government of India’s push for digitalisation and cashless transactions. The system also promotes environmental sustainability in terms of fuel saving and reduction in paper use and pollution,” said CEO S.G.K. Kishore on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The FASTag solution is based on a simple-to-use, reloadable electronic RFID tag that enables automatic deduction of applicable parking charges, while one drives through the car park without stopping for any cash transaction. The tag employs Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology and needs to be affixed on the vehicle’s windscreen after the tag account is active.</p>
      <p>The RFID tag is mapped with the NPCI by the issuer bank(s). The subscriber of this system can use the parking without any manual intervention, such as waiting for a parking receipt at the entry or making cash/credit card payment at the exit. There is no additional cost to customers with respect to the parking fee when a one-time tag is purchased. Post completion of every transaction, a user would receive SMS on the deducted amount, said an official spokesperson.</p>
