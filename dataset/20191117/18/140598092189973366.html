      <h1>Last rites for 'passing on' as charity calls for straight talking about death</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:27:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/henry-bodkin/" target="_blank">Henry Bodkin</a></address>
      <p>People should talk frankly about death rather than using expressions such as “popped their clogs” and “kicked the bucket”, Britain’s leading terminal illness charity has said.</p>
      <p>Marie Curie said that euphemisms should particularly be avoided around children.</p>
      <p>The charity argues that while colourful phrases can blunt the harshness of death in some circumstances, in others they hinder those who are approaching death, and their-loved ones, coming to terms with the situation.</p>
      <p>It comes as new research found there are more than 50 such phrases in everyday use in the UK.</p>
      <p>“Passed away”, was the most commonly used, spoken by approximately half of people at one time or another, followed by “kick the bucket”, used by a quarter.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile “leaving this mortal coil”, “pushing up daisies” and “snuffed it” also make it into the top 10 most popular phrases for death in England.</p>
      <p>Among the less commonly used were “walked over the rainbow bridge”, “pulled his last pint”, “bought the farm” and “doing the final moonwalk”.</p>
      <p>“Wearing a wooden onesie”, was also unearthed by the survey of 8,000 people.</p>
      <p>The charity said that using direct language about death was the best approach when in a hospital or while talking to children.</p>
      <p>In recent years academics have traced the origins of many <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/9700432/The-trench-talk-that-is-now-entrenched-in-the-English-language.html">euphemisms for death to the first world war</a>.</p>
      <p>As well as “pushing up daisies” and “snuffed it”, “gone west”, “been skittled” and “become a landowner” all entered common parlance as a result of the bloody conflict.</p>
      <p>The new advice from Marie Curie follows similar calls from cancer charities to do away with metaphors such as <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/14/telling-patients-fight-cancer-puts-pressure-says-macmillan/">“fighting” or “battling” cancer</a>, which puts patients under pressure and prevent them from openly discussing their fears.</p>
      <p>Matthew Reed, Marie Curie chief executive, said: “It doesn’t matter what you call it, as long as you talk about it. </p>
      <p>“The results show the nation has at least 50 completely different ways of talking about death which suggests society still has some way to go to feel comfortable about talking about dying, death and bereavement.”</p>
      <p>“While most of us say we are comfortable talking about dying and death, the reality is that many of us are not making any preparations as it feels a long way off or something that will cause unnecessary upset both for us and the people around us,” said Mr Reed.</p>
      <p>“But we need to plan more for the end of life, while there is still time to do so. Having these conversations early can be easier than having them when we, or someone we love, is dying.”</p>
      <p>Recent years have seen a drive to improve the way doctors provide and talk about end-of-life care, following figures in 2016 that showed just one in 10 NHS hospitals offers expert care to the dying on a 24/7 basis.</p>
