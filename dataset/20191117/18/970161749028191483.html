      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a>’s former record label <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/28/taylor-swift-record-label-contract-to-end-as-star-becomes-free-to-negotiate-7888995/">Big Machine Label Group</a> were forced to shut their offices early this week after staff faced threats following <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/taylor-swift-reignites-scooter-braun-feud-encourages-fans-go-manager-claims-blocked-performing-songs-11148397/">the company’s public feud</a> with the pop star.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/21/taylor-swift-re-record-old-music-scooter-braun-masters-deal-10610786/">long running drama</a> between Tay, Big Machine executive Scott Borchetta and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/justin-bieber/">Justin Bieber</a>’s manager and the company’s new owner <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/scooter-braun-breaks-silence-taylor-swifts-shocking-statement-11166306/">Scooter Braun</a> reaching a head this week, after the singer claimed the men were holding her music hostage and not allowing her to perform her old songs on TV.</p>
      <p>But with Taylor asking her fans to tweet the two Scotts requesting them to release her from her contact, things got pretty serious down at the record label with a source revealing that the offices were forced to close at 12.30pm on Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The source told <a href="https://www.etonline.com/big-machine-records-offices-shut-down-due-to-threats-amid-taylor-swift-feud-136467">Entertainment Tonight</a> that employees of the company were receiving ‘direct and hostile death threats’, with members of staff of all levels (not just Scott and Scooter) having their personal contact information leaked online by presumed Taylor fans.</p>

      <p>While Taylor claimed that Big Machine and Scooter, who <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/26/taylor-swift-keeps-bad-blood-going-scooter-braun-scott-borchetta-masters-sale-10631417/">she has long had beef with</a> and accused of ‘bullying’, were not letting her perform her old back catalogue at the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/taylor-swift-named-artist-decade-amas-bow-11012992/">American Music Awards</a> and for an upcoming Netflix documentary, representatives for the label <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/big-machine-records-denies-taylor-swift-music-ban-claims-11163830/">have denied these claims</a>.</p>
      <p>‘As Taylor Swift’s partner for over a decade, we were shocked to see her Tumblr statements yesterday based on false information,’ their statement began.</p>

      <p>‘At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere.’</p>
      <p>They continued: ‘Despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families.</p>
      <p>‘Taylor, the narrative you have created does not exist. All we ask is to have a direct and honest conversation. When that happens, you will see there is nothing but respect, kindness and support waiting for you on the other side.’</p>
      <p>But despite their protestations (and thanks to a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/taylor-swifts-team-seemingly-catch-scooter-braun-big-machine-records-shock-email-expose-11164427/">private email seemingly catching Scooter out</a>), it seems like most people are firmly on #TeamTaylor, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/selena-gomez-fumes-scooter-brauns-manipulation-taylor-swift-emotional-statement-11163227/">Selena Gomez</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/halsey-gigi-hadid-lily-allen-slam-scooter-braun-shocking-taylor-swift-statement-11148588/">Halsey and Gigi Hadid</a> coming out in defence of the pop star.</p>

      <p>Here’s hoping this can be sorted out soon.</p>
