      <p>The ignominious fall of Bolivian President Evo Morales was more or less of his own making (Despatches, “Fight for the future of Bolivia,” Nov. 17) . His decision to contest the presidential election for a fourth term, in defiance of the 2016 referendum and the presidential term limits, alienated him from a large number of Bolivians. He was trying to make himself indispensable for the country. It is unfortunate that Mr. Morales, the first indigenous President of his country, was forced to seek political asylum in Mexico. He could have instead gracefully and honourably called it a day following the competition of his third term as President.</p>
