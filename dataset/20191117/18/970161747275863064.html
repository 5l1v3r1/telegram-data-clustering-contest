        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-time-every-night-11168259/">I’m A Celebrity is back for its 19th season</a> on ITV, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/amanda-holden-jamie-theakston-want-ian-wright-win-im-celebrity-caitlyn-jenner-mother-figure-camp-11149748/">Ian Wright</a> the firm favourite to follow in the footsteps <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/who-won-the-2018-series-of-im-a-celebrity-and-what-are-they-doing-now-11167414/">of fellow former footballer Harry Redknapp</a> by succeeding him as the series winner.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As usual, the card is stacked with intrepid stars, although fans of the show will also be excited <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/ant-mcpartlin-way-keen-reunite-best-mate-declan-donnelly-im-celebrity-troubled-year-11169522/">to see the return of Ant McPartlin as co-presenter,</a> rejoining regular partner Declan Donnelly after Holly Willoughby stood in for him last year.</p>
      <p>Promotion for the series has leaned heavily on Ant and Dec, showing them roaring at each other while adrift at sea in a gale, marooned in the Arctic, appealing to a cruise ship on a punctured dinghy and lazing on a deck in the sun.</p>
      <p>Familiar cruelties potentially lie in wait for the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-2019-line-up-suits-up-for-new-series-in-official-photos-11080048/">glamorous cast</a>, including isolation from the outside world and the prospect of being consigned to a Bushtucker Trial at the whim of the voting public.</p>

      <p>So just how much I’m A Celeb do we have to look forward to as the new series kicks off? Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>How long is I’m A Celebrity on for and when did it first air?</h3>
      <p>Since 2013, I’m A Celebrity has run for 22 days – although not all of its contestants last that long, with the likes of Noel Edmonds, who was first out last year, staying for 13 days.</p>
      <p>Illusionist Uri Geller was evicted even sooner in the first run in 2002, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/12/01/noel-edmonds-celebrates-im-a-celebrity-exit-after-landing-record-fee-for-just-nine-days-in-jungle-8198139/">staying for nine days</a> in a series eventually won by former BBC Radio 1 DJ Tony Blackburn.</p>
      <p>This year’s lineup is typically intriguing and eclectic, with James Haskell, who is married to Richard Madeley and Judy Finnegan’s daughter, Chloe, in with a chance of becoming the fourth sportsman to win the series.</p>

      <p>Haskell says his appearance as a beefy rugby player is no reflection of his resilience, insisting: ‘People think you’re big, they think you’re going to be tough. There is that pressure because people look at you and go, “you’re big, you’re going to be fine, mate.”‘</p>
      <p>‘I’m absolutely not. All I want to do is make sure I don’t let my teammates down, cry or be sick on myself if some bugs crawl up my nose.’</p>
      <p>As well as Wright, Coyle and Jossa, the contestants alongside Haskell include presenters Adele Roberts, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/im-a-celebritys-kate-garraway-is-genuinely-worried-shell-get-hangry-in-jungle-over-lack-of-food-11148591/">Kate Garraway</a> and Roman Kemp, comedian Andrew Maxwell, Caitlyn Jenner and Rak-Su singer Myles Stephenson.</p>

      <h3>What time does I’m A Celebrity start?</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/im-a-celebrity-first-look-at-camp-reveals-brand-new-jungle-gym-equipment-area-and-grim-bath-11109312/">latest series of I’m A Celebrity</a> is returning <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-2019-start-date-time-line-hosts-11167643/">in its usual 9pm slot</a> on ITV, which is probably a wise decision given its audience figures of 11m viewers for the opening episode last year.</p>
      <p>Running until 10.45pm, the series starter will introduce the uninitiated to the contestants as they get their first taste of jungle life – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/12/01/noel-edmonds-celebrates-im-a-celebrity-exit-after-landing-record-fee-for-just-nine-days-in-jungle-8198139/">with Nadine Coyle already getting a bit emotional about it all.</a></p>

      <p>The Northern Irish singer is under no illusions about the risks involved in entering the Australian outback, pragmatically observing: ‘The worst thing that could happen in the jungle is death, as far as I know.</p>
      <p>‘I want to be a brave version of myself. You know the rope bridges on the way in? What if I can’t even get onto that?’</p>
