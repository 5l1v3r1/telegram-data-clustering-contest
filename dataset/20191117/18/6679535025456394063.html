      <p>Drinking water samples drawn from the State capital have failed to impress in a quality test conducted by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).</p>
      <p>The 10 samples from the city that went under the scanner failed to meet three of the quality parameters, according to the findings released by Ram Vilas Paswan, Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, in New Delhi on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The samples failed to meet the norms for turbidity (simply put, how murky your water is), aluminium content and the presence of coliform bacteria.</p>
      <p>Samples drawn from various State capitals went under the scanner for IS 10500:2012 ‘Specifications for drinking water’ requirements in two phases.</p>
      <p>The survey had found Mumbai as having the safest tap water while Delhi had the worst. But tap water in Thiruvananthapuram was found to be relatively better off compared to most of the south Indian capital cities.</p>
