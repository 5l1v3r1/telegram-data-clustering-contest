      <p>Actress Faye Dunaway slumps by a pool, seemingly looking with disdain at the Oscar she had picked up the night before for Network.</p>
      <p>The 1977 shot is one of a catalogue of iconic images taken by her then-boyfriend Terry O’Neill, a genius behind the lens best remembered for capturing the faces and the mood of the swinging Sixties.</p>
      <p>O’Neill, 81, who had prostate cancer, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/breaking-iconic-photographer-terry-oneill-20899116">died on Saturday at his home</a> in Battersea, south-west London.</p>
      <p>Singer Elton John, 72, led the tributes, saying: “He was brilliant, funny and I absolutely loved his company.”</p>
      <p>Ex-Mirror Royal photographer Kent Gavin said O’Neill was “a true icon who will be sadly missed”.</p>
      <p>O’Neill was born in Romford, Essex, in 1938. His dad Leonard worked at the Ford car plant, mum Josephine was a housewife.</p>

      <p>In his teens, O’Neill dreamed of being a drummer and took a job at an airline, hoping it would get him to New York to play the jazz clubs.</p>
      <p>Part of his job was to photograph the travellers, and one candid shot changed his life.</p>

      <p>He said: “I happened upon a well-dressed, bowler-hatted man taking a quick nap in the departures area, and he was surrounded by African chieftains, in their regalia.”</p>
      <p>The snoozing man turned out to be Home Secretary Rab Butler, and the photo earned O’Neill a job at the Daily Sketch paper.</p>
      <p>He said: “I was off and running.”</p>

      <p>In 1963, he was sent to photograph The Beatles, and he later said: “That assignment changed the course of my career.”</p>
      <p>When The Rolling Stones asked him to take their pictures, O’Neill decided to make them look like “a travelling blues band” and asked them to bring suitcases.</p>

      <p>He said: “Keith Richards told me, years later, that the suitcase he used was the first one he had ever owned. It still had the tissue paper inside.”</p>
      <p>O’Neill’s roll call of subjects also included David Bowie, Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Sir Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela.</p>
      <p>The Queen was the only one who made him nervous.</p>

      <p>He said: “I researched some horse-racing jokes to break the ice and, thank God, she laughed.”</p>
      <p>With a marriage to actress Vera Day behind him, he wed Faye Dunaway in 1983, but it only lasted four years.</p>
      <p>He leaves third wife Laraine Ashton and three children.</p>

      <p>O’Neill, who collected a CBE in October, looked back on his career in a recent interview.</p>
      <p>He said: “When I look at photos of all the icons I’ve shot, Mandela, Churchill, Sinatra, the memories come back and I think, ‘Yeah, I did all right’.”</p>
