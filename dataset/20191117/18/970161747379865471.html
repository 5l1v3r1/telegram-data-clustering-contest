      <p>A son who went to prison for attacking his own father with a hammer says he does not regret it.</p>
      <p>Ben Wilson, 27, said his father had frequently abused his mum Tracey and that day had threatened to ‘chop everybody up’ with a six-inch knife.</p>
      <p>He heard screaming from his parents’ room and rushed in with the hammer, where he hit his dad at least five times at the home in Billingham, Teesside.</p>
      <p>His dad Craig was left with holes in his face and brain damage and was found with fractures to his jaw, cheekbone, eye sockets and nose.</p>
      <p>Wilson said: ‘I’d do the same again.</p>
      <p>‘I sacrificed myself to save my mam. I thought if I have to do prison for the rest of my life for my family, then I’m going to do it.’</p>

      <p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/">Daily Mirror</a>, he said he snapped after watching his dad beat his mum for almost a decade, including on New Year’s Eve in 2007 when he strangled her and was sentenced to two years in jail.</p>

      <p>Ben Wilson said: ‘I picked up a hammer from my toolbag and went up. He said “what the f*** are you doing, you creepy ****, what’s behind your back?” I belted him on the temple.’</p>
      <p>After hitting his dad he cycled to the police station and handed himself in, still covered in blood.</p>
      <p>He was given six years in jail after he admitted grievous bodily harm in January 2015.</p>
      <p>It was the lowest possible sentence, which the judge said took into account his previous good character and the years he had had to deal with his father’s abuse.</p>

      <p>Wilson said he now believes the law should change to take into account if someone is defending a family member.</p>
      <p>Tragically, he was rebuilding a relationship with his father while in Durham prison, but his father killed himself before he was released.</p>
      <p>He was allowed to leave prison to go to the funeral.</p>
      <p>After serving four years in jail, Wilson was released six months ago and is trying to rebuild his life.</p>
      <p>Despite blaming himself for his father’s death, he said he can’t regret what he did because it might have saved his mother’s life.</p>
      <p>Cleveland Police told the paper they had attended the house several times before the attack.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said the force was ‘extremely sorry’ the family felt let down and officers now received improved training in domestic abuse cases.</p>
