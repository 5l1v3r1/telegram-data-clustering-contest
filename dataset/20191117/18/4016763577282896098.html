      <h1>OneRepublic’s Ryan Tedder Says There’s “Misinformation” On Both Sides Of Taylor Swift &amp; Scooter Braun’s Dispute</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:31:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:31</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Kelley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a>’s conflict with <a href="https://genius.com/artists/scooter-braun">Scooter Braun</a> and Big Machine Records just escalated over a licensing dispute. However, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/onerepublic">OneRepublic</a>’s <a href="https://genius.com/artists/ryan-tedder">Ryan Tedder</a> just told <i><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/ryan-tedder-taylor-swift-vs-big-machine-913616/">Rolling Stone</a></i> that “there’s a lot of misinformation” on both sides.</p>
      <p>The pop superstar claims that Braun and Big Machine’s Scott Borchetta are blocking her upcoming performances and Netflix documentary while strongarming her out of re-recording her pre-<i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Taylor-swift/Lover">Lover</a></i> material.</p>

      <p>Big Machine disputed the allegations in a <a href="https://www.bigmachinelabelgroup.com/news/taylor-swifts-partner-over-decade-we-were-shocked-see-her-tumblr-statements-yesterday-based">blog post</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere. Since Taylor’s decision to leave Big Machine last fall, we have continued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties as she promotes her current record in which we do not financially participate.<br/>The truth is, Taylor has admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars and multiple assets to our company, which is responsible for 120 hardworking employees who helped build her career. We have worked diligently to have a conversation about these matters with Taylor and her team to productively move forward.</blockquote>
      <p>Then Swift’s team hit back against Big Machine’s claims in an email to <i>The New York Times</i>:</p>

      <p>“I can verify that having talked to both parties that there is misinformation,” Tedder added in the interview with <i>Rolling Stone</i> on Nov. 15.</p>
      <p>The omnipresent producer—who worked on <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Taylor-swift/1989">1989</a></i>—has ties on both sides of the dispute. “Taylor is one of the single most talented people I’ve ever worked with in my life, and I absolutely want the best for her,” he said. “I’ve known Scott Borchetta since 2000 when I was an intern at Dreamworks… before Big Machine was even a thought.”</p>
      <p>This year, he’s on songs for the <a href="https://genius.com/artists/jonas-brothers">Jonas Brothers</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/backstreet-boys">Backstreet Boys</a>, and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/camila-cabello">Camila Cabello</a>.</p>
