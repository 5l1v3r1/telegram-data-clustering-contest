      <p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/best-buy-black-friday-deals-2018">Best Buy's Black Friday sale</a> is less than two weeks away, and the retailer is giving us a sneak peek with doorbuster deals that you can shop right now. Today only you can get the Google Pixel 3a on sale for $249.99. That's a $150 discount for the affordable phone that requires activation from Verizon, Sprint, or AT&amp;T. If you're not interested in a carrier offer, Best Buy is also offering a $100 discount on an Unlocked Pixel 3a.<br/><br/>The <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-pixel-3a-review">Pixel 3a</a> was released in May of this year and was touted as Google's most affordable option from its line of Pixel phones. The Pixel 3a features a 5.6-inch HD display, 4GB of RAM, and starts at 64GB of storage. The Google phone features an impressive 8MP front-facing camera for self-portraits and video and provides up to seven hours of battery life. The phone still includes an old-school headphone jack and is available in black, purple or white.<br/><br/>Like we mentioned above, the $150 discount is only valid if you activate your phone at checkout from Verizon, Sprint, or AT&amp;T. Sprint is even offering a further $50 discount, which brings the price of the phone down to just $199.99. If you're interested in an unlocked Pixel 3a, you can still receive a $100 discount. Whichever offer you choose, it's still a fantastic price for a solid Android phone and a great deal to snag before the madness of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a> officially begins.</p>
