      <p>We met our best friends in Magdeburg when it was in the GDR and we see them every year. Unlike John Crace (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/15/the-election-is-affecting-my-mental-health-at-least-im-not-dilyn-the-dog">Digested week</a>, 16 November) we enjoyed speaking with people and sharing the riches of the community, with plenty of colour and shops, and a transport system superior to that which got us to the airport in Britain. Our friends’ mother shared her wisdom: “I have lived in four political and economic systems and, let me tell you, none of them work.”<br/><b>Jonathan Stanley</b><br/><i>Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire</i></p>
      <p>• While on the subject of women’s loos (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/14/queue-ladies-loo-feminist-issue-public-toilets">The queue for the ladies’ loo is a feminist issue</a>, Journal, 14 November), perhaps architects and planners could address the problem of cubicles so tiny that your clothing brushes against the seat when you open the door to get out – even when there is then an unnecessarily large space before you reach the washbasins.<br/><b>Mary McKeown</b><br/><i>Biddenham, Bedfordshire</i></p>
      <p>• Please don’t publish any more best buys from Which? (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/16/waitrose-champagne-named-best-value-bubbly-for-christmas">Supermarket bubbly rivals the best names</a>, 16 November). I went to get my favourite fizz from Waitrose and there was an empty shelf with the fateful notice “Product temporarily unavailable”.<br/><b>Barry Hughes</b><br/><i>Edinburgh</i></p>
      <p>• Prince Andrew: “I <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/16/transcript-prince-andrew-on-the-epstein-scandal">admit fully</a> that my judgment was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honourable.” Ralph Waldo Emerson: “The louder he talked of his honour, the faster we counted our spoons.”<br/><b>Alasdair Buchan</b><br/><i>Brighton</i></p>
      <p>• Are there really no famous women from Stevenage? Shame on the town for its all-male wall of fame (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/16/the-view-from-stevenage-how-will-the-uks-first-new-town-vote">Report</a>, 16 November).<br/><b>Deb Thomas</b><br/><i>London</i></p>
