      <h1>Two-fold increase in road accidents in city: report</h1>
      <h2>Number of fatalities also went up in city in 2018</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:50:56+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:50</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>In 2018, the city’s roads saw the number of accidents more than double from that in the previous year, according to the ‘Road Accidents in India – 2018’ report which has been released by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.</p>
      <p>In 2017, 2,297 accidents were reported in the city, but the number went up to 4,611 in 2018. The number of fatalities increased from 653 to 686 and the number of people injured also went up from 2,083 to 4,129 during the period.</p>
      <p>Piyush Tewari, founder of Save Life Foundation, said unless the agencies concerned take steps to prevent accidents, the trend may continue even in 2019. “Like any other city in the country, Bengaluru too is facing big challenges. There is extremely poor engineering of the roads, poor [traffic rule] enforcement at night, and many parts of the city are poorly lit. These are some of the reasons why there is a spurt in the number of accidents. The State government is still buying time to implement the amended Motor Vehicles Act, as it is not just about penalties; there are provisions as well. The government must make engineers and contractors accountable for poor works that are causing accidents.”</p>
      <p>As per the report, among cities having a population of over a million, Delhi tops the list with the highest number of road crash fatalities (1,690) followed by Chennai (1,260), and Kanpur (698). In terms of road crashes, Chennai tops the list (7,580) followed by Delhi (6,515), and Bengaluru (4,611).</p>
      <p>“There are over 253 million registered vehicles in India and the number grew at a CAGR of 10.11% between 2007 and 2017. The level of vulnerability of road users to accidents is high as the same road space is being shared among a wide variety of motorised and non-motorised vehicles and pedestrians,” stated the report.</p>
      <p>In Bengaluru, where the number of vehicles has crossed 82 lakh, in the absence of a well-integrated mass transport system in all parts of the city, many people are relying on personalised vehicles to commute.</p>
