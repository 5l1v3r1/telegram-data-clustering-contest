      <h2>Escalator to be installed along accident-prone Rajaji Road</h2>

      <p>The district-level observance of the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims has stressed the need for better vigil on the part of pedestrians and motorists to maintain road sense and collectively contribute to curbing road accident deaths.</p>
      <p>A few accident survivors from the city shared their experiences with the public on the occasion with an appeal to uphold better traffic culture.</p>
      <p>Opening the awareness events organised by the Motor Vehicles Department on Sunday, Mayor Thottathil Raveendran said creating road safety awareness among well-educated people was the toughest task in the modern era. “We have a culture of defying every rule. It is purely luck that saves many from accidents,” he observed.</p>
      <p>Mr. Raveendran pointed out that the poor road sense of motorists and pedestrians directly contributed to the rising number of accident deaths. “Speed rule violation is visible everywhere,” he said.</p>
      <p>On action plans on the cards to ensure pedestrians’ safety, Mr. Raveendran said an escalator would be installed along Rajaji Road where pedestrians were found careless while crossing the road. “The facility will help in restricting the reckless entry of pedestrians to the accident-prone road. There will be lifts as well to assist those unable to use the escalator,” he added.</p>
      <p>Regional Transport Officer M.P. Subhash Babu chaired the remembrance meet at which the participants lighted candles in memory of road accident victims. The department also handed over the special financial assistance from the State government to three persons who sustained serious injuries in road accidents.</p>
      <p>Earlier, MVD officials along with trauma care volunteers took out an awareness rally on the Kozhikode beach. Officials said the rally was organised with a call to inculcate better traffic culture and road sense at a younger age. In Kozhikode city alone, 150 persons were killed in various road accidents within the last eight months, which should be an eye opener for all, they said.</p>
