      <h1>'My sons died side by side on ecstasy' Heartbroken dad wants to legalise the drug that killed his two boys in one night</h1>
      <h2>Aberystwyth University student Torin, 19, was found dead alongside his brother Jacques, 20</h2>

      <p>The father of two brothers who died "side by side" after taking ecstasy bought on the dark web has called for all drugs to be legalised.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/aberystwyth-university">Aberystwyth University</a> student Torin, 19, was found dead alongside his brother Jacques, 20, in Manchester in the heart-breaking turn of events weeks before Christmas.</p>
      <p>The boys, who had always been close, had arranged to meet in Manchester to watch a football match as they knew they faced spending Christmas apart.</p>
      <p>Astrophysics student Torin had just started his second year at the University of Aberystwyth.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, talented guitarist Jacques had moved to London to live with Ray’s mum and had started a new job at a hotel.</p>
      <p>So the boys arranged to meet in Manchester to watch United play Hull City at Old Trafford on November 29, 2014.</p>

      <p>That day, the siblings checked into the Grapes pub, in Stoneclough, Bolton, where they started drinking, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/sons-died-side-side-ecstasy-17258852">the Mancester Evening News reports.</a></p>
      <p>CCTV captured them buying two bottles of WKD and a packet of chewing gum which they took back to their hotel, but never consumed.</p>
      <p>Torin was the last to be seen when he came down from their room at around 9.30pm to ask for the pub's Wi-Fi password.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, father Ray Lakeman said: "I know they would have done what they normally did - just watch a video together.</p>
      <p>"That was the last anyone saw of them. That was Saturday night at 9.30pm. They were not found until 2.30pm on Monday."</p>
      <p>The brothers’ bodies were found in the room two days later - after two missing persons reports had been filed.</p>
      <p>During an inquest into their deaths in 2015 a coroner recorded their cause of death as fatal MDMA toxicity.</p>
      <p>Bolton Coroners’ Court heard that Jacques' had almost six times the ‘recreational’ dose of MDMA in his body, while Torin had an even higher amount.</p>
      <p>Pathologist Dr Patrick Ward told the inquest that a lethal limit of ecstasy is an average of 1.7mg.</p>
      <p>The dealer who supplied the drug to the brothers is currently serving a 16-year sentence in prison.</p>

      <p>Ray says: “The obvious thing everyone expects me to say is ‘they should be banned’. If I thought banning drugs works I would support it, of course.”</p>
      <p>“When I went to the inquest in Bolton one of the things that resonated with me was that they said the boys had exceeded what everyone understands to be a recreational dose.</p>
      <p>“It struck me that the authorities know there is a recreational dose that won’t kill you.</p>
      <p>“Of course wherever you buy it from you can’t get a recreational dose because it’s not a regulated market.”</p>
      <p>He adds: “Drugs are banned but it didn’t stop my boys getting hold of it and wanting to take it.</p>
      <p>“I don’t like it and I’m not condoning it but people need to realise their kids are doing it too. You would be surprised how many kids are doing it.</p>
      <p>“Banning it doesn’t stop it. If it did I would be 100 per cent behind banning it, but it won’t stop people wanting to take it.</p>
      <p>“Statistically, my boys were unlucky.”</p>
      <p>He adds: “There is this entrenched argument that drugs are bad. I think most of these deaths are preventable.”</p>
      <p>At the end of the month, Ray will travel to Manchester to retrace his sons' final footsteps on the fifth anniversary of their death.</p>
      <p>He will also be speaking at the Manchester: Take Drugs Seriously conference, organised by campaigning group Anyone’s Child .</p>
      <p>Ray will be calling for legal regulation of drugs along with politicians and former police officers who will discuss a new approach to illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>“I think we need to understand why people are using drugs and I mean drugs generally,” he says.</p>
      <p>“The number of drugs deaths is rising, the strength is increasing and more people are using them. There needs to be a seachange in our thinking, otherwise these deaths will continue.</p>
      <p>“We can’t just enforce the law and arrest our way out of this.”</p>
      <p>Originally from Old Trafford himself, Ray had taken the boys to watch United play when they were children.</p>
      <p>He will return to United’s ground as part of his pilgrimage this month.</p>
      <p>“My boys were very very close,” he says. “They did everything together. They even played in a band together.</p>
      <p>“I know they were just trying to have a good time that night.</p>
