        <i>Mamun Rashid, from east London, arrived back in UK from Turkey, say police</i>
      </p>
      <p>A man has been charged with the preparation of terrorist acts following his arrest at Heathrow airport, the Metropolitan police said.</p>
      <p>Mamun Rashid, from east London, was charged on Sunday after a police investigation had concluded. He arrived back in the UK three days earlier from Turkey after the country said it had deported an Islamic State suspect to the UK.</p>
      <p>The deportation of Rashid, 26, was part of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/08/turkey-isis-suspects-repatriation-islamic-state">controversial push to repatriate the foreign Isis suspects</a> held in Turkish jails.</p>
      <p>The Met statement said: “A man has been charged with a terrorism offence following an investigation by the Met’s counter terrorism command.”</p>
      <p>It said he will appear at Westminster magistrates court on Monday.</p>
