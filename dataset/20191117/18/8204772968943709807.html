        <b>Integrity at Work Conference</b>
      </p>
      <p>Would you know how to handle an ethical dilemma at work? Ask the whistleblowers who have.</p>
      <p>At least that’s a conversation those attending this year’s Integrity at Work Conference will be able to have. Organised by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Transparency+International">Transparency International</a> (TI) Ireland, the event aims to explore how to foster integrity and promote ethical behaviour in the workplace.</p>
      <p>“Recent scandals in Ireland’s banking, policing and energy sectors have highlighted the damaging consequences of ethical misconduct and the need for ethical leadership in our organisations,” TI Ireland said in advance.</p>
      <p>This year’s speaker line-up includes a keynote from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Citigroup">Citigroup</a> whistleblower <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Richard+Bowen">Richard Bowen</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Google">Google</a> whistleblower Dr <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jack+Poulson">Jack Poulson</a>.</p>
      <p>TI Ireland is part of a self-declared “worldwide movement against corruption” which it defines as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain.</p>
      <p>Panellists at the conference will include <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Amanda+Shantz">Amanda Shantz</a>, MBA director at the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Trinity+Business+School">Trinity Business School</a>; Mr <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Justice+John+Hedigan">Justice John Hedigan</a>, chairman of the Irish Banking Culture Board; Trócaire chief executive Caoimhe de <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Barra">Barra</a>; and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Kate+Kenny">Kate Kenny</a>, professor of business and society at <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=NUI+Galway">NUI Galway</a>.</p>

        <b>EY Entrepreneur of the Year Awards</b>
      </p>
      <p>In April, EY noted that cutting-edge technology sat side-by-side with more traditional businesses competing for this year’s Entrepreneur of the Year title. On Thursday, we will find out if it is a taste of the old or the new that ultimately takes the coveted prize.</p>
      <p>“This year our shortlist has everything from fast food to energy, with many of the entrepreneurs representing businesses that are household names,” Kevin McLoughlin, EY partner lead for the awards noted.</p>
      <p>The 2019 shortlist includes Supermac’s founder Pat McDonagh; <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Matt+Ryan">Matt Ryan</a> of hospitality group <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Press">Press</a> Up Entertainment; <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Tom+Cronin">Tom Cronin</a> of Rye River Brewery; and James and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Timothy+McElroy">Timothy McElroy</a> of HouseMyDog – all among 24 finalists selected to compete across three categories.</p>
      <p>These have been selected from more than 120 nominations by a judging panel chaired by 2006 EY Entrepreneur of the Year <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Anne+Heraty">Anne Heraty</a>, who is chief executive of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=CPL">CPL</a> Resources.</p>
      <p>Now in its 22nd year, the EY Entrepreneur of the Year awards programme works to recognise, promote and build a supportive community around Ireland’s high-growth entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p>Representing the full spectrum of industries, the 2019 finalists employ almost 13,000 people and generate annual revenues of almost €1.2 billion.</p>
      <p>With about 1,500 business leaders due to attend, the ceremony takes place in The Citywest Hotel and will be broadcast on <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=RT%C3%89">RTÉ</a> One at 11.15pm.</p>
