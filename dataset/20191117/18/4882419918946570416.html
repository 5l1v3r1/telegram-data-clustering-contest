      <p>Pep Guardiola could leave Manchester City at the end of the season despite having a contract until the following summer.</p>
      <p>That is what is circulating in Manchester, where he is currently in his fourth season following spells with Barcelona and Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>Guardiola's deal with City runs until 2021 and The Mirror points out that he has never broken a contract during his management career.</p>
      <p>However, other reports suggest that he doesn't feel too comfortable where he is anymore and could consider leaving at the end of the current campaign.</p>
      <h3>Renewed in 2018</h3>
      <p>Guardiola, who still has the challenge of winning the Champions League with City, extended his deal with the club in 2018. It was a great moment, with the Premier League and League Cup won.</p>
      <p>The doubt now is if his deal includes an escape clause that would allow him to walk away next summer. He has started to be linked with other clubs in Europe, including Juventus. City have strongly denied that rumour.</p>
      <p>The Mirror have reported that City are working on a replacement for Guardiola regardless, aware that he will not be there forever.</p>
