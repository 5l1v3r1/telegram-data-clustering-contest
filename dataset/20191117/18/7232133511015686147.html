      <h1>Bull Run Intact: Long-Term Bitcoin Price Indicator Remains Long</h1>

      <p>As you likely know, Bitcoin (BTC) has been bleeding out over the past few months, drawing down from $14,000 all the way to $8,500, where the cryptocurrency is priced at now. Just a few weeks ago, the asset was trading as low as $7,300.</p>
      <p>This price action has made many ask: is Bitcoin <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/25/bitcoins-secular-bull-market-may-have-ended-long-term-bear-incoming/">really in a long-term bull trend?</a> Could this be the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/12/bitcoin-market-cycle-is-this-complacency-or-a-new-hope/">end of BTC’s secular bull market?</a> For some reason, many have floated “no” as an answer to both of those questions.</p>
      <p>Though, a number of technical indicators have confirmed that the cryptocurrency market is likely still in a long-term uptrend, no matter what the short-term price action is doing.</p>

      <h3>Bitcoin Remains in Long-Term Upward Trajectory</h3>
      <p>Analyst Cow Jones recently noted that the Ichimoku Cloud, a de-facto “all-in-one” indicator that shows long-term trends, recently printed a very bullish signal: the Kumo line flipped from red to green, implying a long-term bull trend has formed. The <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoCowJones/status/1195489397480669184">analyst remarked</a> that “BTC has NEVER failed the Kumo breakout in its entire history on the weekly.”</p>

      <p>It isn’t only the Ichimoku Cloud that is favoring long-term bulls.</p>
      <p>Per <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/12/bitcoin-volume-profile-suggests-rally-to-bring-price-past-20000-is-near/">previous reports from NewsBTC</a>, the monumental surge of volumes seen last June, which marked an all-time high, is indicative of a long-term bull trend forming.</p>
      <p>Digital asset manager Charles Edwards noted in a Twitter thread that fresh all-time highs in volumes were followed by consolidation, just like we’re seeing now, then “huge rallies”; the growth in volume leading to long-term exponential bull markets that brought Bitcoin to orders of magnitudes higher than it was before the surge.</p>

      <p>And to add to that, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/16/bitcoin-may-soon-face-major-bull-movement-if-history-rhymes/">popular crypto analyst HornHairs noted</a> that the current price action looks very similar to the drawdowns seen in 2017’s bull market, which many used to think were points at which the long-term trend would reverse to bear:</p>
      <blockquote>“I still remember the exact moments of each of these stop runs on $BTC during 2017. Each turned out to be a turning point and end of a corrective period in the larger bull run. I can’t help but think we saw the exact same thing happen recently, just on the weekly chart.”</blockquote>
