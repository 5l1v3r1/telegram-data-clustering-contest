      <p>The January transfer window is getting nearer and speculation is increasing. In Italy, Corrierre dello Sport warn of a possible war between Barcelona and Real Madrid to sign a player from Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>The player in question is central defender Milan Skriniar. He has been linked with both clubs in the past. This time, the reports in Italy suggest the interest could be more serious and that negotiations could even begin this winter, although a summer move is much more probable.</p>
      <p>Inter renewed Skriniar's contract last season and did not include a release clause. The Slovakian defender is a cornerstone of Antonio Conte's side. However, the club would likely sell if they received a big offer from a Barça or a Madrid.</p>
      <p>Until now, Inter have turned down all offers, with most said to be around 60 million euros. The 24-year-old has impressed Barça in recent Champions League meetings between the two sides. He's seen as a good option if Samuel Umtiti's injury problems continue, with Gerard Pique turning 33 in the new year.</p>
