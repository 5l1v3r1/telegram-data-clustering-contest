      <h1>Cab company asked to reimburse travel expenses of complainants</h1>
      <h2>Driver had taken longer route and had advised them incorrectly</h2>

      <p>A consumer forum directed Dot Cabs Pvt Limited to reimburse ₹31,567 to five complainants after it found that the cab driver had taken a longer route to reach a destination, and incorrectly advised them on travel plans. This led to the complainants missing their train to their hometown Kakindada.</p>
      <p>The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum Hyderabad-III was dealing with a complaint filed by Kalla Venkata Vara Prasad Rao, K. Jhansi Rani, K.V.R. Gopi Krishna, K. Chellayiammaa Swathi and K. Samyukta Rani.</p>
      <p>The complainants said it was on September 19, 2016, that they booked a 6 p.m. cab to travel from KPHB to Secunderabad railway station so as to catch Kakinada Express scheduled to leave at 8.45 p.m.</p>
      <p>Despite insisting that the driver take the JNTU- Kukatpally-Balanagar route, he took the Hi-Tec City- Jubilee Hills- Punjagutta-Begumpet route and dropped them at Begumpet railway station, directing them to take the MMTS to Secunderabad railway station.</p>
      <p>The complainants boarded a train at the Begumpet railway station at 8.45 p.m. and reached Secunderabad railway station at 9 p.m. only to realise that they missed their train. They were forced to return to the KPHB and book flights to Rajahmundry for the next day and then an Innova car to reach Kakinada. For this, the complainants showed travel expenses of ₹31,567.</p>
      <p>The forum noted that the driver had taken a longer route and gave wrong advice to the complainants to catch a train at the Begumpet railway station. This, the forum said, amounts to deficiency in service. Apart from directing the respondent to pay travel reimbursement, the forum also instructed the company to pay ₹20,000 as costs.</p>
