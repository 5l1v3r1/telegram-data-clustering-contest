      <p>It is incredulous that the Kerala police in defiance of the Supreme Court order stopped ten women pilgrims who were in the proscribed age group from trekking the hill leading to the Sabarimala temple. The Kerala governmentâ€™s flip-flop on women entering the holy hill has also raised the hackles of activists and women keen to break the glass ceiling. With the clamour for maintaining the sanctity of the temple growing louder, members of the fairer sex had no alternative other than beat a retreat.</p>
