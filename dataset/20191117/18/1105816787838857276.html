      <h1>WATCH: Indian ex-army general supports ‘death for death, rape for rape’ in occupied Kashmir</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:36:33+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>President Dr Arif Alvi has hit out at a former Indian military general for supporting rape of Kashmiri women during a TV debate, where he can be heard saying “death in return for death, and rape in return for rape”.</p>
      <p>“Disgraceful. Maj Gen (R) SP Sinha a leader of BJP advocates rape of Kashmiri women on TV,” said the president in a tweet on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Imagine the fate of women in Indian Occupied Kashmir [IOK] where such men wield power with total impunity,” he added.</p>
      <p>Occupied Kashmir has been under lockdown since August 5 when the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government revoked the autonomous status of the disputed region in a bid to convert the Muslim majority of the area into minority.</p>
      <p>President Alvi also shared a Human Rights Watch report’s <a href="https://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/India2.htm">link</a> on his official Twitter handle saying: “Indian forces have used rape as a tool according to HRW report.”</p>

      <p>During a high-decibel debate on the Kashmiri Pandit exodus on <i>TV 9 Bharatvarsh</i>, Major General (retd) SP Sinha screamed, “<i>Maut ke badle maut</i> [death for death], <i>balatkar ke badle balatkar</i> [rape for rape],” <i><a href="https://theprint.in/india/obnoxious-loose-missile-veterans-slam-ex-major-general-who-called-for-rape-in-kashmir/322333/">The Print</a> </i>reported.</p>
      <p>It drew an instant rebuke from fellow panellists as well as the woman anchor. The retired serviceman was asked to apologise but he stood by his remarks.</p>
      <p>To make matters worse, he did an instant poll on the channel and some from the audience, which included women, can be heard supporting him.</p>
      <p>This is not the first instance where an Indian political leader made a such statement. Earlier in the July, a BJP’s women wing leader was removed from her position after she encouraged “Hindu brothers” to gang-rape Muslim women openly in the streets.</p>
      <p>“Muslim mothers and sisters should have their honour looted as there is no other way to protect India,” said Sunita Singh Gaur in a Facebook post.</p>
