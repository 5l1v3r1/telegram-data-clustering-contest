      <p>Charlotte Crosby has confirmed she's broken up with Josh Ritchie in a surprising statement she shared on social media.</p>
      <p>The news will come as a shock to fans as the former Geordie Shore star, 29, had bragged about how happy they were just days earlier.</p>
      <p>They moved in together in August, with Charlotte leaving the Toon to be with Josh in Bolton - and she'd only just said how good the big step in their two-year relationship had been for them.</p>
      <p>Charlotte told Mirror Online that the move had brought them closer together and they hadn't been rowing at all.</p>

      <p>She said: "We have learnt a lot more [since moving in together] and it's been really, really good. We're getting on so well, I think it's brought us closer together.</p>
      <p>"We've had no arguments about cleaning and stuff, he's so tidy, always doing the washing, it's really been perfect."</p>
      <p>Charlotte was speaking to us to plug the new series of Just Tattoo of Us.</p>
