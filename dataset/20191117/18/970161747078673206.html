      <p>Tyga painted the town red in his Ferrari after a hot dinner date last night, but it’s his mysterious lady friend who’s got everyone talking.</p>
      <p>The pair were spotted sheepishly leaving Delilah restaurant in West Hollywood.</p>
      <p>Dressed in a Louis Vuitton jumper and green headband, Tyga drove his date out of the restaurant’s parking lot as she kept her head down.</p>
      <p>She appears to be wearing a nude-coloured top with blue jeans, but nothing else is yet known about the mystery woman… besides the fact that she bears a striking resemblance to Tyga’s ex, Kylie Jenner.</p>
      <p>Don’t you think?</p>

      <p>The 29-year-old American rapper sparked rumours he was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/02/kylie-jenner-pictured-late-night-visit-ex-tygas-recording-studio-travis-scott-split-10851399/">seeing Kylie again after the two were spotted together in a late night rendezvous</a> straight after she announced her split with Travis Scott.</p>

      <p>In photos obtained by the Mail Online, the mother-of-one is seen outside the Sunset Marquis where Tyga was reportedly laying down tracks in the hotel’s recording studio.</p>
      <p>Kylie was accompanied by her friends Anastasia ‘Stassi’ Karanikolaou and Kelsey Calemine, whom she had earlier partied with at the West Hollywood club Delilah until 2am.</p>
      <p>The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is reported to have left at around 3am – Stassi and Kelsey left via the same exit as Tyga but Kylie was able to avoid the cameras when she made her way home.</p>
      <p>It’s not the first time Kylie and Tyga, 29, have bumped into each other since their split two years ago.</p>
      <p>They were <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/06/kylie-jenner-parties-nightclub-tyga-denies-2am-date-ex-following-travis-scott-split-10870458/">spotted in the same club together</a> last month and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/28/kylie-jenner-ex-tyga-awkwardly-reunite-party-vegas-nightclub-without-travis-scott-10646097/">partied together in Las Vegas</a>.</p>
