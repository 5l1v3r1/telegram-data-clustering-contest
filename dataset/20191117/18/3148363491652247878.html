      <p>Terry David Bateman, 45, and Bradley Allen Rowland, 40, who both worked at Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, as associate professors of chemistry were <a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/two-chemistry-professors-arrested-accused-of-making-meth/29822086">arrested</a> Friday afternoon, the Clark County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Bateman and Rowland face charges of manufacturing meth and using drug paraphernalia, and have been on administrative leave since October 11, KTRK <a href="https://abc13.com/chemistry-professors-accused-of-making-meth-in-school-lab/5702984/">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Staff closed the university science center on October 8 after someone noticed a chemical odor, according to Tina Hall, the university’s associate vice president of marketing and communications.</p>
      <p>The university reopened the building on October 29 after an on-call environmental service installed air filtering systems and temporarily removed windows to facilitate ventilation, Hall said.</p>
      <p>Hall could not confirm what was found after the mysterious odor report or whether the professors made the meth inside the school.</p>
      <p>An investigation into the incident is ongoing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/"><i>Breaking Bad</i></a> aired between 2008 and 2013, and told the story of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who began making crystal meth as a way to make money for his family after he was diagnosed with lung cancer.</p>
