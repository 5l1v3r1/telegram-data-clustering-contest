      <p>POMONA, Calif. (AP) — Robert Hight raced to his third Funny Car season title and second in three years Sunday by advancing to the final round of the season-ending Auto Club NHRA Finals.</p>
      <p>Steve Torrence won his second straight Top Fuel title, Erica Enders took her third Pro Stock crown, and Andrew Hines raced to his sixth Pro Stock Motorcycle championship.</p>
      <p>Hight had a 3.977-second run at 324.59 mph in his Chevrolet Camaro to beat Matt Hagan in the semifinals to wrap up the title, then broke in the final against Jeck Beckman.</p>
      <p>“The most important run of my life was in the semifinals,” Hight said. “When it comes down to one run to win a championship, how will you perform? My heart was beating out of my chest, but we got it done. This has just been the steadiest year I’ve ever had and that’s a real tribute to this team. It’s amazing and I’m the luckiest guy in the world to drive this Funny Car.”</p>
      <p>Beckman earned his 30th Funny Car victory, winning in a Dodge SRT Hellcat.</p>
      <p>Doug Kalitta won the Top Fuel race, Jeg Coughlin Jr. topped the Pro Stock lineup, and Jianna Salinas won in Pro Stock Motorcycle.</p>
