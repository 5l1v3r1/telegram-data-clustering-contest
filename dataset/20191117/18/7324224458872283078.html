      <p>A man fitting Christmas lights in a Leicestershire town had to be rescued after his cherry picker malfunctioned – leaving him stranded for two hours.</p>

      <p>Angela Denison manages the Nags Head pub on Church Street in Market Harborough, outside which the man was stranded on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“He was up there for about two hours,” she told PA.</p>
      <p>“I was thinking poor old Church street never has it easy when it comes to Christmas illuminations, does the man stuck up there want a pint and its a good job its not raining.</p>
      <p>“Our customers enjoyed the unexpected entertainment, the ladies loved the arrival of all those fireman, especially when the impressive rescue equipment arrived.”</p>
      <p>She said around 20 to 25 people stopped to watch the “thrilling rescue” and “seriously embarrassed” light fitter.</p>
