      <p>Car insurance in Tennessee is fairly affordable, with the average driver paying about $US760 a year for coverage according to the <a href="https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-auto-insurance">Insurance Information Institute</a>. Considering that the average US driver pays $US935 for coverage, auto insurance in Tennessee is fairly affordable.</p>
      <p>If you’re looking for car insurance in this state, it’s worth understanding a bit about how car insurance works. Insurance companies look at lots of different <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/car-insurance-rates-men-vs-women-2019-4">factors</a>, including your age, gender, where you live in the state, and even your credit score to determine your rates. Each insurance company looks at these factors differently. That means they will price your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/what-is-an-insurance-premium-definition-cost-2019-7">premium</a>, or the amount you’ll pay for coverage, differently too.</p>
      <p>It’s important to shop around and make sure that you’re getting the best coverage for your money. Here are a few ideas on where to start shopping.</p>
      <h3>Who has the best cheap car insurance in Tennessee?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/car-insurance/credit-scores-affect-auto-insurance-rates/index.htm">Consumer Reports</a> compiled data from each car insurance in every state on pricing formulas. It calculated rates for a single adult driver, and found three companies came out on top for three different credit levels. Here are the best car insurance companies at each credit level in Tennessee, along with their average premium for a single adult driver.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/what-is-a-good-credit-score-2019-3">good credit</a> (670 to 739, according to FICO), drivers can get some affordable rates from these three companies, on average.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>USAA car insurance: $US850 per year</li>
        <li>Tennessee Farmers car insurance: $US906 per year</li>
        <li>State Farm car insurance: $US1,260 per year</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Drivers with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/what-is-an-excellent-credit-score-2019-4">excellent credit scores,</a> (or FICO scores of 800 and above) will get some of the best rates in Tennessee, on average.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>USAA car insurance: $US754 per year</li>

        <li>State Farm car insurance: $US1,029 per year</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Tennessee Farmers car insurance: $US1,064 per year</li>
        <li>USAA car insurance: $US1,874 per year</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Shopping around is essential to getting the best rate for you. Car insurance rates can vary widely, so it’s worth doing some research to get the best price.
