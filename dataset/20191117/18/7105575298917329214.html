      <p><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29750304/katie-holmes-explains-close-bond-daughter-suri-cruise/">Katie Holmes</a> is living the BEST life right now in Sydney.</p>
      <p>The actress traveled to Australia this weekend for work with the Ronald McDonald House charity. On Friday, Katie visited with families at the <a href="https://www.rmhc.org.au/programs/houses/nsw/ronald-mcdonald-house-westmead">Ronald McDonald House Westmead</a>. And then, on Saturday, <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29597754/katie-holmes-suri-cruise-drawing-instagram/">the actress visited</a> McDonald's Haberfield for McHappy Day, where she actually stepped behind the fast food restaurant's counter to work for the cause.</p>
      <p>After she finished her charitable work, Katie took some time to play tourist with a <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29819168/katie-holmes-volunteers-mcdonalds-australia-all-white-outfit/">trip to the Sydney Opera House</a>. On Sunday, she continued her adventure Down Under with a visit t o the Sydney Zoo, where she cuddled with koala bears, hence the "BEST life" declaration above.</p>
      <p>In true <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/g1291/katie-holmes-style/">Katie Holmes fashion</a>, however, she used the cute photo op as a chance to raise some awareness for a good cause.</p>
      <p>"I loved spending time with the koalas at the Sydney zoo," she wrote in the caption of her koala-cuddling pic on Instagram. "I am so sad that so many koalas in the wild were lost in the fires. Many are being treated in koala hospital.

      <p>Open suggestion: Katie's next charitable work should be a world tour of zoos to meet (and pose) with koalas everywhere.</p>
