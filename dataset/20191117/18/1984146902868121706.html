      <p>Hoping to sashay away with the Glitterball on this year's Strictly Come Dancing is Michelle Visage.</p>
      <p>Yes the BBC show we'd all love to be on has returned for 2019 with Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman once again at the helm.</p>
      <p>We can hardly believe it but nearly a year has passed since Stacey Dooley and Kevin Clifton triumphed in the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly</a> ballroom and now it's time for a host of other famous faces to go for Glitterball glory on the hit BBC show.</p>
      <p>Strictly's lineup for this year include <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/who-chris-ramsey-strictly-age-16958100">Chris Ramsey</a> , <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/who-is-saffron-barker-strictly-17271636">Saffron Barker</a> and 'super sub' Kelvin Fletcher.</p>
      <p>And also in the mix is American diva Michelle Visage who landed her first 10s for an Addams Family themed Tango during Halloween Week and then this week danced her dream routine to Madonna's vogue.</p>
      <h3>Who is Michelle Visage?</h3>
      <p>Michelle is most famous for a long standing panelist on Ru Paul's Drag Race and she is also on the panel for the first series of Drag Race UK, which has been a resounding success.</p>
      <p>Born in New Jersey on September 20 1968, Michelle is 51. She was once a member of girl group Seduction, who famously had a song on The Bodyguard soundtrack.</p>
      <p>Michelle is also a judge on Ireland's Got Talent and appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in the same series as Katie Hopkins, Perez Hilton and Katie Price.</p>
