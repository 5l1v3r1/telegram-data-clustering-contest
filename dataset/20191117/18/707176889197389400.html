      <h2>Prime minister risks breaching his new budgetary rules with large election giveaways</h2>

      <p>Boris Johnson will struggle to promise big tax cuts in the Conservative party election manifesto if he wants to live within new Tory budgetary rules, according to public finance experts.</p>
      <p>A combination of little existing budgetary leeway, recent spending increases and future pressure on public services left limited room for tax cuts, said the experts.</p>
      <p>Their views conflict with thinking inside the Treasury, where officials believe it is possible to fund some but far from all of the prime minister’s favoured tax cuts while still running a surplus on the current budget — the difference between government tax receipts and day-to-day public spending.</p>
      <p>Chancellor Sajid Javid announced <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e2310878-014c-11ea-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47">new fiscal rules</a> this month under which he would seek to balance the current budget by 2022-23.</p>
      <p>Treasury officials claim they won a battle with 10 Downing Street over the rules because they allow for more public investment in infrastructure while keeping a tight limit on additional day-to-day spending or tax cuts.</p>
      <p>Officials believe there is scope for certain of Mr Johnson’s preferred tax cuts without breaking Mr Javid’s rules — notably maintaining a freeze on fuel duty and possibly a rise in the starting point at which employees start paying national insurance contributions towards annual earnings of £12,500.</p>
      <p>But there was probably no room under the rules for increasing the threshold at which the 40 per cent higher rate of income tax took effect, said officials.</p>
      <p>During the Conservative party leadership contest in the summer, Mr Johnson proposed raising the threshold to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ccc4f720-8b94-11e9-a24d-b42f641eca37">annual earnings of £80,000</a>, but he told the Sunday Telegraph that the Tory election manifesto would not include this.</p>
      <p>He said the proposal remained an “ambition”, but added that he wanted to focus early tax measures on lifting “the burden” for those on low incomes.</p>

      <p>Public finance experts are not convinced the Treasury’s sums add up.</p>
      <p>In March, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK fiscal watchdog, forecast a current budget surplus of £29.3bn in 2020-21.</p>
      <p>But in September Mr Javid increased day-to-day spending in 2020-21 by £11.7bn, and changes in the accounting treatment of items including corporation tax revenues, student loans and the rate of depreciation on government assets will reduce the projected surplus by a further £14bn.</p>
      <p>These changes imply a current budget surplus of £5bn in 2022-23, rather than the £36.8bn contained in the OBR March forecast.</p>
      <p>Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think-tank, said: “That’s not headroom for tax cuts, that’s a tiny amount, a rounding error and only headroom for uncertainty.”</p>

      <p>Garry Young, head of economic modelling at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, another think-tank, thought the situation was even worse because the latest official economic data had been disappointing and the OBR March forecast was now too optimistic.</p>
      <p>“The simple answer is that there is no scope for [tax cuts] on our forecast,” he said as he expected current budget deficits in every year of the next parliament.</p>
      <p>Deficits have been the norm on the current budget in recent decades. Over the past 40 years, governments have only run surpluses on the current budget in seven of them, even though they were the norm in the 1960s and early 1970s.</p>
      <p>Even if forecasts of a small current budget surplus in 2022-23 prove correct, researchers said there was still a problem because of voters’ desire to see much higher spending on public services after years of austerity.</p>
      <p>Sally Gainsbury, analyst at the Nuffield Trust, a health think-tank, said the performance figures for the NHS in England that were published last week showed the service to be under huge pressure.</p>
      <p>With NHS performance measures deteriorating to levels far below targets, added Ms Gainsbury, “there is no money in the [existing spending] plans to arrest the decline”.</p>

      <p>As well as the NHS, ministers face pressure to increase spending on the criminal justice system, prisons and social care.</p>
      <p>The public services performance tracker produced by the Institute for Government, a think-tank, makes for difficult reading for the Tories.</p>
      <p>Graham Atkins, researcher at the institute, said: “You might be able to meet the increased demographic demand for services and cut taxes so long as you assume there are no greater cost pressures on services, but it’s highly unlikely you can do this and meet the public’s expectations for improved services.”</p>
      <p>Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, a think-tank, said the future was one where “you would expect the state to be getting bigger and if you want to cut taxes, you should decide what areas of public services you would cut or what other taxes you would raise”.</p>
      <p>John Llewellyn, consultant and former chief economist at the OECD, the Paris-based international organisation, said that with Brexit potentially undermining economic growth, the tax cuts proposed by the Conservatives were extraordinary.</p>
      <p>If they went ahead, he added, “the resources to deliver bountiful spending programmes will not be there”.</p>
