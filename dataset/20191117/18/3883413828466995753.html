      <p>Jewish military veterans and serving personnel have marched through central London as part of a Remembrance event.</p>
      <p>They were joined by families, school children and the Jewish Police Association as they marched from Horse Guards Parade to the Cenotaph in Whitehall.</p>
      <p>The annual AJEX Ceremony of Remembrance commemorates the contribution and sacrifice of the Jewish community during wartime.</p>
      <p>The ceremony has been running for the last 85 years and is organised by the Jewish Military Association UK (AJEX).</p>

      <p>Mike Bluestone, AJEX national chairman, said: "Jews from this country and what is now the Commonwealth served this country in disproportionately high numbers, arguably proportionally higher than any other minority group.</p>
      <p>"This annual parade is our opportunity to pay our respect to the war dead of all faiths.</p>
      <p>"We now see anti-semitism on the rise in this country, continental Europe and the USA so it is once again so important that we fly the flag and show that we did serve loyally, we paid the price and continue to serve in today's Armed Forces.</p>
      <p>"It is also our way of saying thank you to this country."</p>

      <p>People from across the country and overseas, including the US and Israel, all took part in the commemorations.</p>
      <p>Philip Robinson, who attended the parade, said "it's nice to be able to make a special contribution".</p>
      <p>The event traditionally takes place the week after <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/armed-forces-lead-nation-cenotaph-remembrance-sunday-service">Remembrance Sunday</a>.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the nation fell silent to <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/armistice-day-2019-uk-honours-fallen-two-minute-silence">mark the 100th Armistice Day</a>.</p>
