      <p>ITHACA, NY -- The heartbroken parents of the Cornell University student who mysteriously died after attending a fraternity party in October are demanding answers.<br/><br/>Freshman Antonio Tsialas attended the off-campus frat party at Phi Kappa Psi in Ithaca, New York, after having dinner with his mother and father, who were in town for parents weekend, <a href="https://www.news10.com/news/police-searching-for-missing-cornell-student/">WTEN in Albany reported.</a><br/><br/>The 18-year-old soccer team goalie never made it back to his dorm, and his body was later discovered at the bottom of a gorge.<br/><br/>His parents, John Tsialas and Flavia Tomasello, said they're offering a $10,000 reward for information.<br/><br/>"There are people that know what happened, but nothing is being said," John Tsialas said.<br/><br/>In a statement, Cornell's president Martha Pollack said officials have not determined Antonio's cause of death but called the party "an unregistered fraternity-sponsored event" where alcohol was served.<br/><br/>"These events, still under investigation, regrettably follow a pattern of misconduct in the Greek-letter system, a pattern that is emblematic of enduring problems that we, as a community, must recommit ourselves to solving," <a href="https://statements.cornell.edu/2019/20191108-sorority-and-fraternity-activities.cfm">the statement read</a>.<br/><br/>The university has since banned fraternity and social events for the rest of the semester.<br/><br/>This tragedy comes as fraternities across America are under heightened scrutiny. In the past month, <a href="https://abc7.com/san-diego-state-freshman-dies-after-attending-frat-party/5690865/">five deaths reportedly involved college fraternities</a>.<br/><br/>"We have to really take a closer look at these organizations, their practices, the behavior of some of the members," Tomasello said.<br/><br/>The Phi Kappa Psi fraternity told ABC News in a statement that they extend their deepest condolences to the Tsialas family and they said their members are working with police in the investigation.<br/><br/>University police said they've issued subpoenas and search warrants and will turn over evidence to state investigators.</p>
