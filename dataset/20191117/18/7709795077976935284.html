        <b>Cristiano Ronaldo reached 99 international goals as he helped defending champions Portugal qualify for the Euro 2020 finals next summer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Portugal will be able to defend the title they won in France in 2016 after a 2-0 win over Luxembourg saw them beat Serbia to the second automatic spot from their qualifying group.</p>
      <p>It was a tough game for Portugal against stubborn and well-drilled opposition on a difficult pitch, but they got ahead with a superb touch and finish from Brune Fernandes six minutes before half time.</p>
      <p>Luxembourg continued to frustrate the visitor, who only made sure of their qualification four minutes from the end thanks to an expert piece of goal-poaching from the Juventus man.</p>

      <p>Goal line technology might have thought otherwise had it been active in the game, as Ronaldo prodded home Diogo Jota's effort right on the shadow of the line.</p>
      <p>That took Ronaldo to 99 international goals, but despite having a few other opportunities he could not reach three figures for his country - and the wait for that landmark stretches on a further game.</p>
      <p>Serbia were battling with Portugal for the second automatic spot, but they were held to a 2-2 draw against group winners Ukraine, who had already sealed qualification.</p>
      <p>A 93rd-minute winner from Artem Biesiedin condemned Serbia to the play-offs as it stands.</p>
