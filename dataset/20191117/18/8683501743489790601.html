      <p>Every so often, a new word trends on the internet. On <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484336/All-Your-Last-Minute-Disney-Questions-Answered">Disney+ launch day</a>, it was "Maclunkey."</p>
      <p>The never-ending changes to the Han/Greedo scene in <i>Star Wars: A New Hope</i> <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484511/disneys-version-of-a-new-hope-changes-the-han-solo-and-greedo-scene-in-a-weird-way">added a new twist in the Disney+ version</a>, giving Greedo the final line of "Maclunkey." That was a new addition to <i>Star Wars: Episode IV</i>, after George Lucas already changed <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/652489/Who-Shot-First-According-Guy-Who-Played-Greedo">the original Mos Eisley Cantina scene</a> from <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2423371/han-shot-first-heres-where-the-kasdans-stand">Han shooting first to Greedo shooting first</a>.</p>
      <p>Paul Blake played Greedo in <i>Star Wars: A New Hope</i>, and he told <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/star-wars-greedo-maclunkey-disney-plus-exclusive-interview/">Empire</a> he did indeed see the new "Maclunkey" version of the scene:</p>
      <blockquote>I did! I couldn't understand a word of it. (laughs) It confused me incredibly, but I've never understood anything about the movies anyway, particularly that. The convention I've just come back from, I had a million opinions from everybody. This new word!</blockquote>
      <p>It has to be interesting to be part of the <i>Star Wars</i> convention circuit as someone who played a character in one iconic scene -- while hidden under a mask -- in one movie back in 1977. It must be especially interesting if you never quite understood the movies. The character of Greedo appeared in a deleted scene in <i>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</i>, but not played by Paul Blake. Greedo was also in an episode of <i>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</i>.</p>
      <p>Linguist Larry Ward actually performed the voice of Greedo in <i>A New Hope</i>, but Paul Blake told Empire "Maclunkey" certainly <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/589049/How-Han-Greedo-Star-Wars-Scene-Was-Originally-Going-Play-Out">wasn't in any of the dialogue</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>No, Greedo wasn't even a Rodian when we filmed it, he was just called 'The Alien'. George was forced to stick in that scene when he cut all the stuff with Declan [Mulholland], who played the original Jabba The Hutt. My little bit in English was just a simple, straightforward cowboy scene. 'Going somewhere? Give me the money. If you don't give me the money, I'll shoot you. I've been looking forward to this for a long time.' That's about it, as far as I can remember. I certainly don't remember the word 'Maclunkey'. Are you sure that's not the noise he made when his very brittle green head hit the table? Or he was saying 'ouch' in Rodian just before he fired?</blockquote>
      <p>You can hear Greedo say "Maclunkey" as his last word in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH19gKo7W7w&amp;feature=emb_title">new version of the scene</a>:</p>

      <p>However, it does work as a last line if you consider "Maclunkey" is said to roughly mean "This'll be the end of you." That's the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484588/greedos-viral-final-line-might-have-a-connection-to-the-star-wars-prequels">translation going around via fans</a>, and it was previously delivered in Huttese by the pod racer Sebulba in <i>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</i>.</p>
      <p>From that perspective, "Maclunkey" does make sense, since Greedo thinks he's getting in one last quality zinger before blowing Han Solo away. History just didn't turn out that way. (Greedo would've <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1719479/how-adam-driver-felt-after-watching-star-wars-the-force-awakens-shocking-han-solo-scene">loved <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i>, though</a>.)</p>
