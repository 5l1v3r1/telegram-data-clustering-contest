      <p>Trainer Andrew Lerner enjoyed an emotional win Sunday when<b> <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Queen_Bee_To_You">Queen Bee to You</a> </b>drew off to win the $100,000 <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/stakes/Betty_Grable"><b>Betty Grable Stakes</b></a> for California-bred distaffers at Del Mar.</p>
      <p>The second career stakes win for Queen Bee to You comes exactly one week after Lerner endured the lows of the sport when stablemate Princess Dorian suffered a serious leg injury at Del Mar.</p>
      <p>"Just happy she made it around the track safely more than anything with everything that's going on," Lerner told TVG immediately after the race. "What a great win here. Flavien [Prat] rode her perfectly. Team did a great job. Just a lot of emotion with everything that happened."</p>
      <p>Queen Bee to You stalked the pace while racing three-wide behind fractions of :22.82 and :45.33 set by Creative Instinct with odds-on favorite Mo See Cal racing between those horses in second.</p>
      <p>Prat was full of horse entering the stretch as Queen Bee to You surged to the front and then drew off to win by 4 1/2 lengths. Show it N Moe It was second and was followed by Mo See Cal, who came up empty in her first start since the Breeders' Cup Distaff.</p>
      <p>Queen Bee to You completed seven furlongs in 1:22.90 and paid $8.00 while providing Lerner with his first Del Mar stakes win.</p>
      <p>"When I asked her on the turn, she really went," Prat said. "She’s won at a mile before, but I think seven eighths is just right for her.”</p>

      <p>Owners Christopher St. Hillaire and Adam Vail of Newport Beach, Calif. claimed Queen Bee to You for $50,000 out of a maiden-claiming race on Dec. 1, 2016. The daughter of Old Topper became a stakes winner earlier this season when winning the one-mile Bertrando Stakes at Los Alamitos in June. Most recently, Queen Bee to You was off the board in the Clement Hirsch (G1), third in the E.B.Johnston Stakes Stakes and fifth when trying turf in the California Distaff on Oct. 12.</p>
      <p>“We put this mare in some tough spots," Lerner said. "Two against the boys, one in the Clement Hirsch. We tried some different things with her. I’m glad she vindicated us today. It’s a great feeling and an emotional win. She’s versatile, she can run on dirt or grass, but we’ve had trouble finding races for her. It’s a matter of finding the right spot and the right distance. Her last race really sharpened her for this.”</p>
      <p>Queen Bee improves her record to 6-11-5 from 31 starts with earnings of $478,770.</p>
      <p>Following her injury last Sunday, Princess Dorian underwent successful surgery and was <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/news/Injured_Del_Mar_horse_in_good_spirits_after_successful_surgery_123">reportedly</a> in "good spirits" this week.</p>
