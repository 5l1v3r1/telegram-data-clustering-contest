      <h1>Soros Opens University Campus in Vienna After Being Forced Out of Hungary</h1>
      <h2>The Jewish billionaire had to move his university from Budapest after Hungary passed a law making it impossible for the institution to issue American-accredited degrees</h2>

      <p>A private university founded by philanthropist George Soros opened a new campus in Vienna.</p>
      <p>The Central European University had to leave Budapest last year after the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/despite-eu-pressure-hungary-won-t-soften-laws-to-allow-soros-college-to-stay-1.7108166">passed legislation</a> last year that made it impossible for the university to remain in Hungary. The law passed in April 2017 made it impossible for the university to issue American-accredited degrees.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-the-intellectual-at-the-forefront-of-the-battle-between-the-open-society-and-its-ene-1.7278679">Soros </a>said Friday during the official opening that his charitable foundation will commit $830 million to the university.</p>
      <p>Founded by Soros in 1991 and chartered in the U.S. state of New York, the liberal university that has attracted students from some 100 countries around the world was a threat to Orban, who is a nationalist.</p>
      <p>Orban routinely decries the Hungarian-born Soros, a Jewish billionaire philanthropist, as a sinister interloper in terms some have described as <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-anti-semitism-1.5598882">anti-Semitic.</a></p>
