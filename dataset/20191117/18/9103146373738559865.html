        <b>“He also promised me a cash prize for knocking out Dube.”</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Africa Heavyweight Championship</b><br/><br/>S. Kiwanuka v T. Dube<br/><br/><b>Date</b>: 29 November<br/><br/><b>Venue</b>: IUEA Auditorium, Kansanga<br/><br/><b>Charges</b>: 20,000/=, 50,000/= &amp; 100,000 (Table)<br/><br/><b>Undercards </b><br/><br/>R. Muwonge v J. Odongo<br/><br/>Sgt. Muzei v B. Sajabi<br/><br/>J. Mpungu v H. Muhumuza<br/><br/>S. Male v C. Kakande<br/><br/>I. Onyango v C. Saidi<br/><br/>A. Mercy v T. Nakimuli<br/><br/>Shafik Kiwanuka’s life will not be the same if he stops Thamsanga Dube on November 29 in the WBF African heavyweight title fight at IUEA in Kansanga.<br/><br/>It is a needless reminder in many ways even though that has not stopped friends and partners of Kiwanuka from stressing the point.<br/><br/>On Friday morning, it was Major General Elly Kayanja’s turn.<br/><br/>“He met me to encourage me and boost my morale,” Kiwanuka said.<br/><br/>“He also promised me a cash prize for knocking out Dube.”<br/><br/>It is a welcome motivation no doubt although it is interesting to wonder how a knockout demand can affect Kiwanuka’s display.<br/><br/>“It won’t put me on pressure because I have a plan and I have a good coach in Abdul Tebazalwa, who has fought at the Olympics and has deeply studied boxing and knows exactly what we must do. Whatever plan he has is the one I will go with”.<br/><br/>Kiwanuka boasts two knockouts in his first fights in the pro ranks and many will be betting on number three arriving on November 29. That is how high Kiwanuka’s bar is already set.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> </p>
