      <p>TEL AVIV, Israel — International soccer superstar Lionel Messi has arrived in Israel for a much-anticipated match, despite calls for boycott and the threat of rocket fire.</p>
      <p>The Argentinian national team landed Sunday in Israel for an international friendly match against Uruguay in Tel Aviv.</p>
      <p>A Palestinian protest campaign derailed a planned visit by Messi last year for a World Cup warmup match, and last week’s violence in Gaza threatened to cancel the exhibition match set for Monday.</p>
      <p>Messi and the Argentinians will face his Barcelona teammate Luis Suarez and the Uruguayans in a game as eagerly anticipated for its political ramifications as its sporting star power.</p>
