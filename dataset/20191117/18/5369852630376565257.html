      <p>RACING 92 HAD 20 points to spare as they dominated troubled Saracens in an impressive Heineken Champions Cup Pool 4 encounter on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>The Parisians made a blistering start to the contest and never took their feet off the gas, dominating the collision, possession (67%) and territory (69%) against a young Sarries side shorn of its England World Cup contingent and in the midst of a salary-cap controversy which threatens to derail the European championsâ€™ season.</p>
      <p>Donnacha Ryan played 65 minutes for the French Top 14 outfit, while Simon Zebo made his introduction on 72.</p>
      <p>After an early penalty by Maxime Machenaud, Virimi Vakatawa drew first blood in the try stakes, the French intenrational centre cutting a hole through the Sarries defence as Racing quickly capitalised on a stolen lineout.</p>
      <p>The two sides traded successful three-pointers by Ben Spencer and Machenaud before Racing crossed again before the half-hour mark, this time through Teddy Thomas who finished sublimely in the right-hand corner, staying inbounds despite the best efforts of a couple of Saracens defenders.</p>
      <p>Alex Lozowski replied for the visitors who brought the deficit back to eight after the break, but three minutes later, a couple of moments of magic by Finn Russell all but killed the tie.</p>

      <p>A flowing move started and finished by the imperious Scot put Racing on the brink of a bonus point, and it arrived after the hour mark as Wenceslas Lauret broke away to score with relative ease following a driving maul.</p>

      <p>Sarries host Ospreys in a do-or-die clash at Allianz Park next weekend, while pool-toppers Racing visit Munster who trail the Frenchmen only on points difference, and by a single point.</p>
