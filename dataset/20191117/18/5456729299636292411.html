      <h1>Super Eagles sink Lesotho as Osimhen nets twice in AFCON Qualifiers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:35:45+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/sports/football/363808-super-eagles-sink-lesotho-as-osimhen-nets-twice-in-afcon-qualifiers.html" target="_blank">Tunde Eludini</a></address>
      <p>The <b><a href="https://twitter.com/NGSuperEagles">Super Eagles of Nigeria</a></b> are in cruise control in their bid to qualify for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations billed to take place in Cameroon as they romped to a 4-2 win over <b><a href="https://www.national-football-teams.com/country/104/2019/Lesotho.html">Lesotho</a> </b>in their second game of the qualifying series.</p>
      <p>Victor Osimhen banged in two goals and also provided two assists in the impressive win recorded by the Super Eagles.</p>
      <p>Coach Gernot Rohr’s men had started the qualifiers with a <b><a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/sports/football/362765-afcon-qualifiers-super-eagles-secure-comeback-win-over-benin-republic.html">2-1 win over the Squirrels of Benin Republic</a></b>. Even though they had to come from behind yet again in Sunday’s tie in Maseru, they did so in style finishing with the commendable scoreline.</p>
      <p>It was the Crocodiles that struck first when Masoabi Nkoto jumped above his marker – Semi Ajayi – to head home the curtain-raiser for the hosts.</p>
      <p>However, Nigeria rallied back as Osimhen connected well with Iwobi and the Everton man made no mistake slotting home from close range.</p>
      <p>The continued pressure by the Eagles saw them shoot in front with Samuel Chukwueze heading home to give Nigeria’s Super Eagles a 2-1 lead going into the half time.</p>
      <p>For all his hard work in the first half, Osimhen after coming quite close on a number of occasions capped his wonderful display with two goals in the second to give Nigeria a massive 4-1 lead.</p>
      <p>However, in the latter stages of the game, Lesotho got some sort of consolation as Chidozie Awaziem scored an own goal as the game finally ended 4-2 in favour of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Before Sunday’s tie, Lesotho have only suffered two defeats at the Setsoto Stadium in the past three years, the most recent being a 2-0 2019 AFCON qualifier loss to Uganda on October 2018.</p>
      <p>Though Nigeria would be proud to have made it two wins in two games in the Afcon qualifying series, the need to get it in the defence cannot be overemphasized.</p>
      <p>With Sunday’s outcome, the Super Eagles have conceded in eight of their last nine games.</p>
      <p>The only clean sheet within this period was the 1-0 third/fourth place victory over Tunisia at the 2019 AFCON tournament in Egypt.</p>
