      <h1>Kosovo 0-4 England player ratings: Harry Winks impresses as Three Lions romp to victory</h1>
      <h2>England secured top spot in Group A of Euro 2020 qualifying as they ran out victorious in their first-ever visit to Pristina to face Kosovo</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:53:08+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:53</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>England produced a professional away performance in Kosovo to ensure top spot in their <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> qualifying group.</p>
      <p>Winks opened the scoring on the half hour mark, slotting home a perfectly-crafted team move for his first international goal.</p>
      <p>But it was far from vintage from England, regularly being caught out by the Kosovan counter attack and forcing Nick Pope into a busier afternoon than initially hoped.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/england-football-team">England</a> rallied and Harry Kane was not going to pass up a gift presented to him in the closing stages, cushioning the ball home on the half-volley to double the advantage.</p>
      <p>Marcus Rashford then wrapped up proceedings for sure, with time for Mason Mount to add a fourth.</p>
      <p>Here is how John Cross, our man in Pristina, rated and slated the performances...</p>

      <h3>England ratings</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Pope 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>His first start and competitive game as <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> keeper now seems to be No2.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alexander-Arnold 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Had to stay back as little chance to get forward, but looked nice and solid.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Maguire 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Made some good marauding runs forward. Heâ€™s well established as No1 centre half.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mings 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>So commanding in every sense - dominated with his size and strength. Excellent.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Chilwell 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not quite as spectacular as Thursday, but still very good both in attack and getting forward.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rice 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Might be Rice or Winks, but did well defensively late on. Solid rather than spectacular.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Winks 8 MOTM</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pushed further forward but seized the opportunity to bag his first England goal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Oxlade-Chamberlain 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Troubled by an early slip, he recovered and put in another excellent Euros audition.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sterling 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not a hint of a hangover from last week. Provided two assists. Excellent.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hudson-Odoi 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wasteful in possession, kept giving the ball away and not making use of it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kane 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Worked hard for the team and got rewarded by extending his remarkable scoring run.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Substitutes</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rashford, for Hudson-Odoi, 59 mins, 7</p>
      <p>Mount, for Oxlade-Chamberlain, 73 mins</p>
      <p>Tomori, for Alexander-Arnold, 84 mins</p>
      <h3>Kosovo ratings</h3>
      <p>Muric 6, Vojvoda 6, Rrahmani 6, Aliti 6, Kololli 7, Rashica 6, Dresevic 6, V Berisha 5 (Halimi, 65, 6), Hadergjonaj 5 (Zhegrova, 73), Celina 6, Nuhiu 6 (Rashani, 82).</p>
