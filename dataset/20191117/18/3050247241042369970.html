      <h1>Venezuela to Pay Retirees and Pensioners Christmas Bonus in Petro</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:28:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:28</time> by <a rel="author">Adrian Zmudzinski</a></address>
      <p>Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro announced that the Christmas bonus of the country’s retirees and pensioners will be paid to them in the national cryptocurrency Petro.</p>
      <p>The Twitter profile of local news outlet Venepress <a href="https://twitter.com/venepress/status/1196081964794691585">reported</a> on Maduro’s remarks on Nov. 17. This particular instance is not the first time that Venezuela pushes Petro into the wallets of pensioners so far.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/report-venezuela-converts-pension-bonuses-into-state-issued-crypto-petro">reported</a> in December last year, Venezuela back then has automatically converted pensioners’ bonuses for the year into Petro.</p>
      <h3>Petro, the future for Venezuelan economy?</h3>
      <p>The crypto asset in question has been first <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/petro-ignited-venezuela-launches-pre-sale-of-oil-backed-national-cryptocurrency">launched</a> for a pre-sale in February last year and raised concerns among foreign observers from the start. In late August last year, Petro <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/experts-venezuelas-petro-is-a-smokescreen-backed-by-centralized-debt-crippled-entity">was</a> already scathingly denounced as an opaque “stunt” backed by a centralized and debt-saddled entity.</p>
      <p>Still, the national cryptocurrency and cryptocurrencies as a whole are being increasingly pushed by the local government.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph Spain <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-news-from-the-spanish-speaking-world-nov-1016-in-review">reported</a> on Nov. 13, the Deputy of the National Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, Francisco Torrealba, said that he believes all currencies will be replaced by cryptocurrencies.</p>
      <p>Speaking about Venezuela, Torrealba claimed that the country is facing a great change and Maduro is making a “great contribution” to the country by creating the Petro. He concluded his interview by saying that "everything will be from this currency [the Petro].”</p>
