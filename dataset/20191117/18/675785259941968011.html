      <p>There's just hours to go until the start of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, but it doesn't look like Holly Willoughby will be tuning in.</p>
      <p>She skipped a night in front of the TV with the rest of the nation to attend the premiere of Frozen 2 in London on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Holly, 38, is more than just a fan of the ITV reality show as she was brought in to replace Ant McPartlin when he took a year out of I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>A self-confessed Disney fan, Holly made sure she didn't miss out on being one of the first to see the highly anticipated sequel.</p>
