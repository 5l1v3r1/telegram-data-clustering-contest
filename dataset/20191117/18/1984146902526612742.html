      <p>Newcastle United will hope to step up contract talks with a number of first team players as the future of some key first teamers remains unclear.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/dubravka-carroll-schar-bruce-newcastle-17142305">The Magpies clinched a new contract for Martin Dubravka</a> after weeks of talks and Steve Bruce is hoping for further progress on some senior men. But Newcastle are still searching for a breakthrough in a number of discussions.</p>
      <p>Newcastle have been in talks with Isaac Hayden since the summer as they look to tie the midfielder down to an improved deal to reflect his improvement since the turn of the year. His deal expires in 2021, which is also the case for Fabian Schar, Matt Ritchie and Jonjo Shelvey – who was wanted by West Ham in the summer and had an opportunity to leave before Rafa Benitez’s exit.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/isaac-hayden-newcastle-united-future-17211669">A deal for Hayden looks achievable</a> - although the player himself says he's shelved that talk as he concentrates on winning back his place - while there has been contact with the other players. Schar’s outstanding form has alerted suitors from elsewhere but Newcastle would like him to stay.</p>

      <p>Shelvey and Ritchie’s situations remain clouded in uncertainty, with the latter a big part of the club’s success in recent years but facing questions about whether his deal will be extended at the age of 30. Ritchie recently stepped away from international football with Scotland and will not be looking for a short-term extension with United.</p>
      <p>It is a sizeable part of Lee Charnley’s workload in the next 18 months, with seven players out of contract in 2020 including current first teamer Federico Fernandez, who has been excellent since signing from Swansea.</p>
      <p>Karl Darlow is another who United have signalled a desire to keep while midfielder Ki is almost certain to leave in the close season. Andy Carroll's future will depend on how things pan out for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Magpies haven’t made any progress on a new contract for Sean Longstaff and his brother Matty Longstaff is still in talks with the club just a few weeks before <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/newcastle-matty-longstaff-england-europe-17246796">he could sign a pre-contract agreement with European clubs</a> . </p>
