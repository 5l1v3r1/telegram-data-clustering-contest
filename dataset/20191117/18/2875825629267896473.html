      <h1>Kosovo 0-4 England: Three Lions look forward to Euro 2020 after routine win - 5 talking points</h1>
      <h2>Goals from Harry Winks, Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford and Mason Mount gave England all three points to finish their Group A qualifying commitments with minimal fuss</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:49:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:49</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/england-football-team">England</a> concluded their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign with a routine victory in a dead rubber fixture in Kosovo.</p>
      <p>With the Three Lions' path to next summer's tournament already confirmed, boss Gareth Southgate made several changes to the side which thrashed Montenegro.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/harry-winks">Harry Winks</a> was deployed in a more advanced midfield role, and broke the deadlock with his first international goal in the first half.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old sent the goalkeeper the wrong way to slot the ball into the corner, after he had controlled Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's pass to spin into the box.</p>
      <p>Captain <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/harry-kane">Harry Kane</a> then added another to his growing tally, half-volleying home a loose ball from close range which had looped into the air off a Kosovo foot.</p>

      <p>Marcus Rashford scored the third with a placed effort, before Mason Mount added a fourth in injury-time to complete the win.</p>
      <p>Here are the talking points from Pristina...</p>
      <h3>Sterling's return closes chapter</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>It's not been an ideal international break for Raheem Sterling.</p>
      <p>The headlines had already been made prior to the Kosovo clash, following a real challenge of Southgate's management after the training ground bust-up involving the forward and Gomez.</p>
      <p>Sterling's return to the side came with little fanfare, and was more a formality.</p>
      <p>And whilst his performance wasn't one of his best, and subdued in parts, he was at least able to put the episode with Gomez behind him.</p>
      <p>England need their best player on song next summer to stand any chance of making the latter stages of the tournament, and he should now be able to join up for the international meet without any leftover fallout.</p>
      <p>Southgate's test now is to try and achieve the same for Gomez.</p>
      <h3>Mings could provide defence solution</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The defensive concerns that blighted Thursday's attacking display against Montenegro were not as evident here, thought it was far from perfect.</p>
      <p>It was a different test, but credit must still go to Tyrone Mings, who stepped into the Three Lions back four for his second cap and looked solid and assured.</p>
      <p>Alongside Maguire the pair are an imposing presence, and whilst John Stones is Southgate's preferred choice, the Aston Villa man has an opportunity to shoehorn his way into the starting XI for the Euros.</p>
      <p>With Gomez now fourth choice at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , and question marks remaining over Stones's fitness and proneness to an error, Mings could well be a shock starter come the tournament.</p>
      <p>He can play out from the back, and is a more no-nonsense defender, who has certainly done his chances no harm.</p>
      <h3>Kosovo show class with warm welcome</h3>

      <p>Kosovo went to great lengths to welcome England to the country and the level of respect was heartwarming.</p>
      <p>After Britain's support during political tensions helped liberate the country in the nineties, Kosovo could not have done more to make Gareth Southgate's men feel at home.</p>
      <p>The Three Lions were given Kosovo's favoured hotel to stay in, whilst the hosts moved elsewhere, while their were appreciative banners on display, and even a thank you over the PA tannoy before kick-off as the home fans held up St Georges flags.</p>
      <p>It was a huge difference to the racism nightmare which England were subjected to in Bulgaria in their last away encounter - and something that should not be understated.</p>
      <h3>Midfield options provide promise</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Southgate has been given plenty of food for thought over the course of these two qualifiers.</p>
      <p>After the defeat to Czech Republic there were fears England lacked quality in the midfield three, but they have been allayed in these matches.</p>
      <p>The return of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has provided a huge boost, and he looks almost certain to start next summer - providing he can stay fit and in-form - after two talismanic performances.</p>
      <p>Harry Winks was given a more advanced role against Kosovo, and scored his first international goal to give Southgate another option, with Rice at the base of the three in behind.</p>
      <p>It's easy to forget that Jordan Henderson didn't even feature over the two matches, nor Dele Alli, while James Maddison and Mason Mount are finding their feet at international level.</p>
      <p>Suddenly that midfield three is looking like it could be a real head-scratcher for the manager.</p>
      <h3>Hudson-Odoi's place not a certainty</h3>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> youngster is super-talented, but so are those ahead of him.</p>
      <p>Sancho, Sterling and Rashford all stand in his way of the starting XI, but it was good for him to get some minutes under his belt.</p>
      <p>At 19 he is still raw, and with competition for places rife at Chelsea, he has some work to do.</p>
      <p>He looked sharp at times - a jinking run across the face of the box and shot the best example.</p>
      <p>But he struggled and gave the ball away cheaply at others, before he was substituted just before the hour.</p>
      <p>Attention now turns to next summer, as only 23 can make it on the plane for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>And whilst Hudson-Odoi could be a cracking wild card, there's a chance he may just miss out.</p>
