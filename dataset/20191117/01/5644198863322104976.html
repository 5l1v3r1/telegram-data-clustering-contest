      <p>VALENCIA, Spain: French whizz kid Fabio Quartararo romped to his sixth pole position of the championship at the season-closing Valencia Grand Prix on Saturday (Nov 16), with world champion Marc Marquez right on his tail.</p>
      <p>Under bright blue skies, Yamaha-SRT's 20-year-old Quartararo dominated the closing stage of qualifying on the tight 4km Ricardo Tormo circuit after choosing the more dangerous hard tyres for the cold conditions.</p>

      <p>Ducati have won three times at Valencia and their Australian rider Jack Miller also made the front row to give the Italian team a shot at a surprise victory on Sunday.</p>
      <p>No French rider has won a MotoGP race for 20 years, but the rookie Quartararo insisted his aim was only a seventh podium finish of the campaign on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Trying to snap the French hoodoo, Quartararo could be forgiven for seeing an omen in the fact Regis Laconi's triumph in 1999 was at Valencia and was achieved on a Yamaha.</p>
      <p>"The main goal tomorrow is to get a very strong first three laps, after that we'll see, the target is the podium," he said.</p>
      <p>"For a first season to be 'Rookie of the year' with six poles and six podiums is great, especially if you look where we came from," Quartararo added.</p>
      <p>Six-time top-class world champion Marquez managed second place on the grid despite a fall in practice on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>"It was a good lap in the end, we are happy with second place," said Marquez, who has won 11 of the 18 races so far this season.</p>
      <p>"For the race on Sunday we will have to do it differently because Quartararo was very fast," added the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>The emergence of the French rookie has spiced up the close of the 2019 season with the Yamaha man losing out on the last lap in cat-and-mouse struggles with Marquez twice.</p>
      <p>The race will also serve as a swansong for retiring former three-time MotoGP world champion Jorge Lorenzo, 32, whose season has been littered with accidents.</p>
      <p>"He is a real champion. The moment he feels he can't be in the top places he decided to stop," his teammate Marquez said.</p>
      <p>Lorenzo's place in the Honda team may be taken by Marquez's younger brother Alex, champion of the Moto2 category this season.</p>
