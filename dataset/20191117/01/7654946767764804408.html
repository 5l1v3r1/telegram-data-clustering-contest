      <p>An American citizen who Turkey accuses of being a member of ISIS was returned to the United States.</p>
      <p>Turkish media identified the man as Muhammad Darwis B., 39, <a href="https://apnews.com/cad53e8403754f17b84fe1f8c440810b">The Associated Press reported.</a></p>
      <p>Federal authorities questioned the man when he arrived Friday night at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, DC, and inspected his electronic devices, AP said, citing a government report.</p>
      <p>He was allowed to enter the country en route to visit relatives in Texas.</p>
      <p>Turkey deported the man after he spent five days in no man’s land between Turkey and Greece, where he had asked to be sent. He arrived in the US after government officials agreed to accept him and provided travel documents.</p>
      <p>Turkey’s controversial President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/trump-meets-with-turkeys-president-claims-kurds-ceasefire-is-holding/">visited the White House on Wednesday</a> and discussed the offensive in Syria with President Trump.</p>
      <p>Turkey captured suspected ISIS members after crossing the boarder into Syria. It says foreigners are being returned to their home countries.</p>
