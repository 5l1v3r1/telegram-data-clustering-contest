As those who follow the brunette bombshell on social media know, Ren regularly shares photos and videos on her popular page to keep fans in the loop on what she’s up to. Last night, the model tagged herself at the Revolve Awards where she appeared to have a great time.</p>
      <p>In the image that was shared for her 13 million-plus fans, Alexis struck a pose front and center, with an ivy-colored wall just at her back. The stunner wore her long, dark locks down and slightly waved and they fell right around her shoulders. The beauty sported a stunning application of makeup for the occasion that included eyeliner, mascara, blush, highlighter, and lipstick while accessorizing the look with a pair of dangly earrings.</p>
      <p>The beauty’s amazing figure was on full display in a curve-hugging black dress that fit her body like a glove. The top of the dress hit right around her neck, accentuating her assets and hips. The photo has only been live on her page for a short amount of time but it’s earned the bombshell a ton of attention, racking up over 346,000 likes and well over 800 comments.</p>
