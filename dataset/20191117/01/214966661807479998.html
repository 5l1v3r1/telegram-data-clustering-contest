      <h1>Seven teens arrested on first night of Gold Coast Schoolies </h1>

      <p>Schoolies celebrations kicked off on the Gold Coast overnight, with thousands of teens packing the glitter strip.</p>
      <p>It appears most school leavers were well-behaved, with only seven Schoolies arrested on 15 charges.</p>
      <p>All of the charges related to drug possession and all of the teens were male.</p>
      <p>However it was our paramedics who were put to the test, with 50 Schoolies assessed at the on-site Emergency Treatment Centre in Surfers Paradise.</p>
      <p>Those treated included 27 females and 23 males, with only three patients requiring further assessment at hospital.</p>
      <p>Police say that while they were generally pleased with the behaviour of schoolies, drugs continue to be a big concern.</p>
      <p>“It is timely to remind the community that the possession and consumption of illicit drugs is illegal. Not only is it illegal – it is also dangerous and could have fatal consequences,” police said.</p>
      <p>“Police will not hesitate and continue to take enforcement action against anyone found in possession of, supplying, trafficking or producing dangerous drugs.”</p>
      <p>Last year in 2018, for the same time frame, there were six Schoolies arrested.</p>
      <p>Eleven Toolies were also arrested within the precinct overnight.</p>
      <p>The majority of the non-schoolies arrested related to drug and public nuisance offences.</p>
