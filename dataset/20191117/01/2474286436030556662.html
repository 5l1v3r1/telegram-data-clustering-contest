      <p>Out in the scrub of Warialda an unusual white dome is the only sign of life.</p>
      <p>It's Faraway Domes, a glamping experience started by the Munsie farming family once they'd sold all their stock in the drought.</p>
      <p>The foray into customer service paid off, it's just earned them a gold NSW Tourism Award for New Tourism Business.</p>
      <p>"It was a big risk, but in January this year we had fully de-stocked our cattle and there was no income from the farming operation," Kate Munsie said.</p>

      <p>"We saw a niche in the market to invite city people to come and experience the bush, and give back to struggling communities."</p>
      <p>The dome has been such a success that the family has lodged a development application for a second.</p>
      <p>The new dome would be big enough to accommodate families and a few kilometres from the original on the 10,000-acre property, Ms Munsie said.</p>
      <p>"It's a family-run business and everyone has been able to bring their skills to it," she said.</p>
      <p>"All our feedback has been really positive and we're very proud of it because it's been a lot of hard work.</p>
      <p>"The elevated deck that looks over the valley with the outdoor bathtub has been a hit so we'll keep that for the second dome."</p>
      <p>A plunge pool is in the works for the existing dome, and the second could see style inspiration from Ms Munsie's recent trip to South America.</p>
      <p>"It's top secret at the moment but we're drawing inspiration from everywhere," she said.</p>
      <p>The win earns Faraway Domes an automatic entry into the Australian Tourism Awards in Canberra in 2020.</p>
      <p>Among the region's winners was the Nundle Woolen Mill with silver for Cultural Tourism.</p>
