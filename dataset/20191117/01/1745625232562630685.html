      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/olivia-culpo/">Olivia Culpo</a> offered fans an enticing glimpse at her incredible <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/bikini/">bikini</a> body in her latest <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> post. Reporting from the idyllic Caribbean island of St. Barths — where she is currently enjoying a fantastic time in the company of friends, as previously reported by <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5745469/olivia-culpo-underwear/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a> — the stunning swimsuit model and actress showed off her spectacular figure in a chic bikini top, and sent pulses racing among her ever-expanding fanbase.</p>
      <p>Photographed at the beach, the <i>Sports Illustrated</i> babe rocked an elegant embroidered bikini in a gorgeous deep-red color that beautifully complemented her glowing tan. The eye-catching beach item boasted a low-cut neckline, offering a generous view of her deep cleavage. The sizzling piece also featured thick straps that framed her ample decolletage area in an alluring display, shining the spotlight on her perky chest.</p>
      <p>Olivia teamed up the fabulous bikini top with a simple classy black skirt, for a sexy-chic look that was both seductive and sophisticated. The <i>Model Squad</i> alum accessorized with a trendy Burberry handbag — a black design that sported a beige plaid front and was ornate with countless stud details tracing its outline on all sides. A lavish gold pendant necklace by Jacquie Aiche adorned her decolletage, calling even further attention to her shapely bust. The Rhode Island-born beauty completed her look with a delicate gold bracelet and a couple of shiny rings.</p>
      <p>Olivia’s glam was in perfect tune with her stylish ensemble. The <i>Maxim</i> Hot 100 cover girl donned a bold red lipstick that mirrored the color of her red-hot bikini top. She also wore a discreet dark eyeshadow and sported perfectly contoured eyebrows. Her chestnut-brown tresses were pulled back in a slightly unkempt style that put a sultry spin on her iconic long bob.</p>

      <p>The 2012 Miss Universe winner showcased the smoldering look in a collection of four photos that saw her lounging on a white beach sofa as she basked in the golden rays of the sun. Olivia lay on her side, leaning on her elbow as she reclined on the comfortable sofa with a drink within reach. She sprawled her beautiful body on a fuzzy white-and-blue beach towel, all the while shooting a flirtatious look at the camera. The provocative posture emphasized her round hip and sculpted thigh, which was slightly visible from underneath the loose-fitting skirt. At the same time, the 27-year-old hottie exposed her toned midriff, teasing her narrow waistline.</p>
      <p>“Can i have that towel afterwards,” one ardent fan commented on the photo, clearly entranced by Olivia’s smoking-hot look.</p>
      <p>The gorgeous sun-kissed photo also treated followers to a breathtaking view of the island and the sparkling sea. A massive forest-strewn mountain loomed in the background, with a serene blue sky hanging overhead and a shining sun lighting up the horizon. Plenty of people were seen enjoying the peaceful location, suggesting that the beach was a very popular one. In fact Olivia used a geotag on her post to let fans know that she was hanging out at the famous Shellona beach club in St. Barths.</p>
