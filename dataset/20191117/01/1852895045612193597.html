      <h1>Emerald Fennell Reveals ‘The Crown’ Will Explore A Side Of Duchess Camilla That ‘Hasn’t Been Told’</h1>

      <h4>Emerald Fennell stars in ‘The Crown’ season 3 as a young Camilla, now the Duchess of Cornwall. HL spoke EXCLUSIVELY with Emerald, who believes the world has ‘never really heard’ Camilla’s story like this before.</h4>
      <p>Since<a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/pics/the-crown-photos-season-3-pictures/"><i> The Crown</i> season 3</a> covers the royal family from 1964 until well into the 1970s, the show will explore the beginning of young <b>Prince Charles’</b> relationship with a young<b> Camilla Shand</b>, now the Duchess of Cornwall. <b>Emerald Fennell</b>, 34, plays young Camilla in the critically-acclaimed Netflix series. She spoke with <b>HollywoodLife</b> EXCLUSIVELY at the BAFTA Tea Party in Sept. 2019 and admitted that the audition process wasn’t “very nerve-wracking” but she did have her eye on the role of Camilla two years. “I just think she’s a figure in our culture that I think is really sort of interesting, and we’ve never really heard her story actually,” Emerald told <b>HollywoodLife</b>. “And so, and the more I’ve learned about it, it’s just been fascinating. It’s just a dream.” She also added, “She was a young woman who fell in love with someone. And it’s a story I think that maybe hasn’t been told, so I hope that I’ve done a good job.”</p>
      <p>While much of the research about Camilla was provided for her, Emerald did note that Camilla was a “very private person” so there was “very little footage of her.” She had nothing but high praise for her <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/10/21/the-crown-trailer-prince-charles-josh-oconnor-season-3-video/">co-star <b>Josh O’Connor</b></a>, who plays Prince Charles. “It is, honestly, I think one of the best performances I’ve ever seen,” Emerald said. “I stopped acting because I’m like, ‘Whoa.’ And then I’m like, “Oh no, the camera’s on. I better do some acting!’ He’s so good.”</p>
      <p>Prince Charles, now 71, and Camilla, now 72, met in the early 1970s at a polo match. They quickly fell into a relationship but broke things off when Charles joined the Royal Navy. Camilla went on to marry <b>Andrew Parker Bowles</b>, whom she was involved with before she met Charles, in 1973. Charles went on to marry<b> Princess Diana</b> in 1981. Over the years, Charles and Camilla had an ongoing love affair. They eventually married in 2005.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/tag/the-crown"><i>The Crown</i></a> is based on the royal family, it’s not a direct play-by-play. “The great thing about the show is that it is history, but it’s [creator]<b> Peter Morgan’s</b> imagining of it,” Emerald continued. “I think that everyone understands that it is fictionalized and also everyone is a real person and they’re very, very careful to make sure that all the characters are so well-rounded. I think anyone who watches it would think it’s fair and brilliant and beautifully done, I hope.”</p>
      <p><i>The Crown</i> season 3 will end in 1977. The fourth season is currently being filmed and will cover the royal family into the 1980s. All 10 episodes of <i>The Crown</i> season 3 will begin streaming on Nov. 17.</p>
