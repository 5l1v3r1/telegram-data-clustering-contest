      <h1>Operation 'Heat Shield' to bring on 50,000 more police hours to combat summer crime spike</h1>

      <p>The WA government will pour an extra $5 million into the $1.55 billion police budget over the next 6 months for an extra 50,000 overtime policing hours to combat the traditional summer crime spike.</p>
      <p>'Operation Heat Shield' will run from December 1 to May 31 and see police presence boosted using overtime hours in suburban and regional centres across the state on a scale WA has never seen before.</p>

      <p>Suburban centres, the Perth CBD and shopping, entertainment and transport hubs will receive increased patrols to deter anti-social behaviour.</p>
      <p>Special police sections such as the mounted section, K-9 unit, Regional Operations Group, Juvenile Action Group and bike and beat patrols will all form part of the blitz.</p>
      <p>Deputy Police Commissioner Gary Dreibergs said offering police overtime hours was a more flexible method of combating crime spikes than just hiring more officers.</p>
      <p>"For us, overtime provides us great flexibility, if you have specific police numbers it doesn't assist with the capacity and the flexibility that we need to deploy resources at short notice to certain locations and plan accordingly," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Dreibergs said he was confident police would be able to handle the extra demand.</p>
      <p>"Our police officers will be asked to do extra overtime for sure but the ones we've been speaking to they're ready for it, they're keen to do it and our officers really have that focus on keeping the community safe and we're really comfortable that we'll be able to manage with the money that we have been provided," he said.</p>
      <p>Police Minister Michelle Roberts said the operation was about being proactive.</p>
      <p>"There will be that visible presence," she said.</p>
      <p>"It's also about some targetted operations to deal with a lot of those petty crimes that people find intimidating, whether that's crimes like vandalism and minor assaults."</p>
      <p>In response to questions about recent reports of violence and anti-social behaviour in the Perth CBD and Northbridge Ms Roberts said they had been handled well by police and this operation was about giving the community reassurance that cops would be there when needed.</p>
      <p>"Police have generally responded really quickly to events in the City of Perth and elsewhere and they are there to respond to those serious instances," she said.</p>
      <p>"Just about every one that's been brought to my attention in recent times police have actually caught up with the offender and they've been brought to justice but I appreciate whether it's the City of Perth, Mandurah or Joondalup people want to know that there are police there on hand should something occur.</p>
      <p>"Some of what occurs in our major shopping areas is just unruly behaviour, its groups of youths jostling and carrying on.</p>
      <p>"People find that intimidating. They're not always committing a crime, this is just reassurance that says police are there and if the group of youths that are perhaps just jostling with each other want to do something worse than that, police are there on hand."</p>

      <p>Ms Roberts said the operation was able to be paid for thanks to the government's strong financial position.</p>
      <p>In 2013 WA police injected another 40 officers into the south east metro district for a month as part of Operation Carambola, which resulted in nearly 1000 charges and a significant drop in crime in and around the Armadale area.</p>
