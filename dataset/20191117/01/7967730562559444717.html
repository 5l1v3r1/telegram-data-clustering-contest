      <h1>Rising petrol prices fuel violent protests in Iran</h1>

      <p><b>Dubai:</b> Riot police and security forces have clashed with demonstrators in Tehran and dozens of cities across Iran, Iranian news agencies and social media say, as protests against a rise in petrol prices turned political.</p>
      <p>The reports said demonstrators chanted anti-government slogans around the country on Saturday, a day after the government increased the price of regular petrol to 15,000 rials (52¢) a litre from 10,000 rials (35¢) and rationed it.</p>

      <p>State television said police clashed with what it called rioters in some cities and fired tear gas to disperse them.</p>
      <p>At least six people were dead after security forces clashed with protesters, according to Persian language news outlets.</p>
      <p>"People attacked a fuel storage warehouse in Sirjan and tried to set fire to it," the state news agency IRNA said.</p>
      <p>Videos posted on social media from inside Iran showed protesters setting fire to buildings and clashing with riot police. In other videos protesters blocked roads and set fires in the streets in Tehran and some other cities. Some chanted slogans against top officials.</p>
      <p>The videos and other images on social media could not be verified by Reuters.</p>

      <p>"People are very angry here in Shiraz [city]. I heard gun shots. Hundreds of people are in the streets. They burned a police car this morning," a witness, who asked not to be named, told Reuters by telephone.</p>
      <p>Protests spread to least 40 cities and towns on Saturday, Iranian media said. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo supported the demonstrators, writing on Twitter, "As I said to the people of Iran almost a year and a half ago: The United States is with you."</p>
      <p>Videos on social media showed riot police firing tear gas and using clubs to disperse protesters in several cities. A video shared on Twitter showed protesters setting fire to a bank.</p>
      <p>Under the price changes, the price for a litre of rationed gasoline rose to 15,000 rials, from 10,000 rials per litre on Thursday, and a monthly ration for each private car was set at 60 litres. Any purchases over that limit would be triple the previous price. Gasoline in Iran still remains among the world's cheapest.</p>

        <b>How have economic protests played out before?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In late 2017, demonstrations broke out across Iran in the largest challenge to the government in years. They started December 28 in the politically conservative city of Mashhad, spurred by a stunted economy and rising prices for everyday items like eggs, before spiraling into calls for reforms from Iran's political and religious leaders.</p>
      <p>From Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, protests spread to nearly every province. They were notably centered among the working class and in provincial towns and cities outside the capital, populations generally seen as more pro-regime.</p>
      <p>The protests didn't stay centered on rising prices for long. Protesters soon added chants against government corruption and mismanagement. Others questioned why Iran was funding proxies in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Gaza, while Iranians themselves faced shortages.</p>

      <p>"Iranian protesters chanted "Death to the dictator!" as they tore down posters of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds absolute authority in Iran," The Washington Post's Erin Cunningham reported of one scene on the fourth day of protests. "Public criticism of Khamenei is generally taboo."</p>
      <p>The leaderless protests ultimately died down within weeks after Rouhani repealed some price hikes - alongside Iran's heavy-handed security forces intervening.</p>
      <p>At least 26 protesters were killed and "nine people arrested in connection with protests died in custody under suspicious circumstances," according to London-based Amnesty International. Authorities also blocked access to internet and popular messaging services such as Telegram, through which people had organised and shared information.</p>
      <p>Still, small-scale protests continued throughout the year.</p>
      <p>"Despite the regime's violent response to the initial 2017 and 2018 demonstrations, individuals and coordinated groups of dissidents continued to publicly demand political and social reforms throughout 2018," CNN reported. "As Iran's economic crisis deepened, peaceful demonstrations were held during July and August which authorities dispersed by using live ammunition, tear gas and water cannons, according to Amnesty."</p>
      <p>In another wave, teachers in Tehran protested for higher wages in October and November of 2018. Twenty-three people were arrested and eight sentenced to prison, according to Amnesty International.</p>
      <p>"Over the course of the year, more than 7000 protesters, students, journalists, environmental activists, workers and human rights defenders, including lawyers, women's rights activists, minority rights activists and trade unionists, were arrested, many arbitrarily," it said.</p>
      <p>"Historically, Iranians have always been quick to air their grievances" through protests, said Holly Dagres, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council focused on Iran.</p>
