      <p>One month after the release of Yo Gotti, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/lil-uzi-vert">Lil Uzi Vert</a> and Megan Thee Stallion’s new spin on <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/yo-gotti-megan-thee-stallion-lil-uzi-vert-pose-remix-song-stream">“Pose,”</a> <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/a-boogie-wit-da-hoodie">A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie</a> is reaching out to Uzi for his latest single, “Reply.” According to some of A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie’s statements in recent interviews, the Bronx-bread rapper has cooked up several different songs with Lil Uzi Vert, with at least “five” of them on course to see release. As Boogie Wit Da Hoodie reveals, his connection and bond with Lil Uzi Vert is deeper than just studio sessions.</p>
      <p>“It’s the same thing that me and every other artist I get along with got: It’s that real genuine shit when you link up with an artist,” A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie explained to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8528674/a-boogie-interview-audiomack"><i>Billboard</i></a> when asked about his chemistry with his “Reply” cohort Lil Uzi Vert. “F*ck the cameras. When it’s off-cameras, that’s when it’s real. You don’t gotta see the love on video. This shit is real life. This shit we talking about is our real thoughts and shit. We be talking about shit that we go through. N***as don’t understand shit.”</p>
