      <h1>J.K. Dobbins Had Great Response To Penn State, Michigan Question</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T01:58:58+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 01:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Another Saturday, another blowout for Ohio State’s football program. The Buckeyes demolished Rutgers in New Jersey this afternoon, 56-21, to remain undefeated on the year.</p>
      <p>It’s been a season of blowouts for Ryan Day’s program. The College Football Playoff contenders have won each of their 10 games this season and all of those victories <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-buckeyes/ohio-state-rutgers-streak-24-point-wins-1971-nebraska">have come by at least 24 points</a>.</p>
      <p>Ohio State will probably have some closer games to finish the season. The Buckeyes take on Penn State next weekend and Michigan the following Saturday.</p>
      <p>J.K. Dobbins, who’s sat many a fourth quarter this year, was asked following the game about having a bigger workload moving forward. His response was perfect.</p>
      <p>“Why do they have to be four-quarter games?” he said.</p>

      <p>Well played, Mr. Dobbins.</p>
      <p>He’s right, too. It wouldn’t be that surprising to see the Buckeyes dominate Penn State and Michigan like they have everyone else this season.</p>
      <p>The Nittany Lions and the Wolverines are good, but Day’s team is probably still a step or two above.</p>
      <p>Ohio State is likely to stick at No. 2 in the new College Football Playoff rankings released on Tuesday night.</p>
