      <h1>Baylor Is Blowing Out Oklahoma In The First Half</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T01:52:13+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 01:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>The undefeated Baylor Bears came into Saturday night’s contest against Oklahoma as the No. 13 ranked team in the College Football Playoff rankings. It’s look like that could change a lot when the next set of rankings are unveiled on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Baylor has jumped all over Oklahoma – to the tune of a 28-3 lead early in the second quarter. The Bears have scored 28 unanswered points after a field goal from the Sooners to open the game.</p>
      <p>Baylor quarterback Charlie Brewer has been a machine thus far. In just over one quarter, he’s 7-of-10 for 101 yards with two touchdowns. He’s also rushed for 60 yards with two scores.</p>
      <p>Baylor’s defense has also forced two turnovers – including an interception from Oklahoma quarterback Jalen Hurts. It’s been a disastrous start for the Sooners.</p>

      <p>Oklahoma entered the game as the No. 10 team in the College Football Playoff rankings. The Sooners are going to need to stage an incredible comeback if they still want to be part of the discussion moving forward.</p>
