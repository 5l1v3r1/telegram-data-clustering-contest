      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/ari/arizona-coyotes">Coyotes</a> goaltender <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/2610321/darcy-kuemper">Darcy Kuemper</a> slammed an opponent to the ice after <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/cgy/calgary-flames">Calgary's</a> <a href="http://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/2563039/johnny-gaudreau">Johnny Gaudreau</a> cross-checked Arizona's <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/5125/jason-demers">Jason Demers</a> while Demers was down on the ice, setting off a brawl that resulted in a combined 14 penalty minutes during Arizona's <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/game/_/gameId/401145343">3-0 win</a> over the Flames on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Kuemper put the Flames' <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/4024854/matthew-tkachuk">Matthew Tkachuk</a> in a headlock and flipped him off his feet following the cross-check by Gaudreau in the second period. Tkachuk came up swinging and landed a few blows on Kuemper in a dustup that included Calgary goaltender <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/4063288/david-rittich">David Rittich</a> barreling in from the other side of the rink.</p>

      <p>"It happens. A little bit of fun, but then we got back to work," Kuemper said. "That's a big part of our success is how tight we are as a group. We want to have each other's back out there."</p>
      <p>The crowd chanted Kuemper's name as he returned to the net. The 14 combined penalty minutes for three Flames and two Coyotes included <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/3069613/vinnie-hinostroza">Vinnie Hinostroza</a> serving Kuemper's four-minute roughing penalty and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/3904186/rasmus-andersson">Rasmus Andersson</a> sitting for two minutes on Rittich's behalf.</p>
      <p>"It's nice having my security guard back there: Darcy," Demers said. "We've been building toward something the last couple of years, and this season feels different for us."</p>
      <p>Demers said he thought the Flames thought he went down too easily on a hit that preceded the fracas.</p>
      <p>"Just trying to give it to him a bit. We didn't like that too much," Tkachuk said. "Whenever something happens when Johnny's involved, you've got to stick up for him."</p>
      <p>Kuemper, who played in his 200th career NHL game Saturday, stopped 35 shots in posting his second shutout of the season.</p>
