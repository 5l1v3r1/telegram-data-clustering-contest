      <h1>Kirby Smart Reveals What He Told His Players After Win vs. Auburn</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T01:25:01+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 01:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, No. 12 Auburn hosted No. 4 Georgia in a huge SEC showdown with College Football Playoff implications.</p>
      <p>After a slow start to the game, Georgia’s offense finally got the ball rolling. The Bulldogs took a 21-0 lead into the fourth quarter and looked to be running away with the game.</p>
      <p>However, the Tigers stormed back in the fourth quarter and cut the Bulldogs’ lead to just seven points late in the fourth quarter. Their comeback attempt fell just short and Georgia survived with a 21-14 win.</p>
      <p>After the game, Georgia head coach Kirby Smart delivered a message to his team.</p>
      <blockquote>“I told them: How bout those f***in’ Dawgs,” <a href="https://twitter.com/SethWEmerson/status/1195870858910281729">Smart said</a>.</blockquote>
      <p>Immediately after the win, Smart tried to celebrate with one of his players, but it didn’t go too well. Smart played college ball back in the day, but he’s no match for defensive lineman Travon Walker.</p>
      <p>Check it out.</p>

      <p>Walker comes in at nearly 300 pounds, so we won’t take too much away from Smart here.</p>
      <p>With the win, Georgia improves to 9-1 on the season. The Bulldogs have a huge home game against Texas A&amp;M coming up next weekend before a rivalry game against Georgia Tech to end the season.</p>
      <p>It looks like the Bulldogs will represent the SEC East in the SEC title game.</p>
