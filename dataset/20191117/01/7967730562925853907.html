      <h1>Oaks filly Gamay to have bone chip removed</h1>

      <p>Oaks filly Gamay will be set for a late autumn campaign following a small operation to remove a bone chip from her near fore knee.</p>
      <p>The Archie Alexander-trained filly was a $3.80 contender for the group 1 VRC Oaks earlier this month after winning the 2000-metre group 3 Ethereal in impressive style, but wasn't at her best over 2500 metres, failing to stay the trip.</p>

      <p>X-rays have revealed a small bone chip floating in her knee, and while Alexander was confident it hadn't affected her racing to date, he said the decision was made to get it removed now.</p>
      <p>"[It's] just very minor. Winx had the same thing in her fetlock, it didn't stop her," Alexander said.</p>
      <p>"She's been X-rayed at probably three different stages of her career, and there's always been a suspicion and a bit of grumbling on in her knees that we've monitored. It's very, very small, she's fine but it's more just for the long-term of her career. To have a bone chip in there floating around, it's better out than in.</p>

      <p>"If we weren't on to it and didn't X-ray, she's still sound, she's fine. But because we're going right through her by taking X-rays we've noticed it, and we don't want to get two weeks before a big race and find out it's a bone chip that's annoying her. Now she's going to the paddock, we'll remove it and have clean knees to work with."</p>
      <p>Alexander said the arthroscopy wouldn't affect Gamay's spell at all.</p>
      <p>"She'll have a bit of a break, but we'll plan to be back in the autumn," he said.</p>
      <p>"It will be late autumn though, it wouldn't be the start of the autumn. We'd look at Sydney, Adelaide or even Queensland."</p>
      <p>A race like the 2000-metre group 1 Australasian Oaks in early May could be the ideal target for the daughter of Pierro, but Alexander said plenty of options were on the table.</p>

      <p>"She's not a true stayer but I think a mile to 2000, there's a bit more of Pierro coming out of her and her dam was by a Golden Slipper winner so thereâ€™s probably a bit more speed than stamina in the family," he said.</p>
      <p>"Ryan Moore, the last 400 [metres in the Oaks], he said 'I was very empty'.</p>
      <p>"Her best win was a group 3 over 2000 so that's probably the plan really, to stick around that mark."</p>
      <p>In other follow-ups out of the Melbourne Cup carnival, the Anthony Freedman stable informed stewards that Santa Ana Lane pulled up well from the Darley Sprint but would be spelled, as will three-year-old fillies Absolute Flirt (Danny O'Brien) and Taraayef (Lindsay Park).</p>
      <p>Meanwhile three-year-old Godolphin colt Knickpoint, who disappointed as a $2.40 favourite in the listed Hilton Stakes on Stakes Day, will continue his preparation after pulling up fine.</p>
