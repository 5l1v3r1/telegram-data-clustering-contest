      <h1>Dave East’s SURVIVAL First-Week Numbers Have Sparked Def Jam Rumor: “The Label’s Strongly Considering To Drop Dave”</h1>

      <p>The rumor mill is heating up in a major way this weekend. New reports claim rap artist <b>Dave East</b> could possibly get dropped by Def Jam Recordings over the retail performance of his newly released <i>Survival</i> album.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hiphopoverload.com/def-jam-may-drop-dave-east-after-his-album-only-sold-3000-copies-it-first-landing-164-on-billboard/">a </a><i><a href="https://www.hiphopoverload.com/def-jam-may-drop-dave-east-after-his-album-only-sold-3000-copies-it-first-landing-164-on-billboard/">Hip Hop Overload</a></i><a href="https://www.hiphopoverload.com/def-jam-may-drop-dave-east-after-his-album-only-sold-3000-copies-it-first-landing-164-on-billboard/"> report</a>, East’s opening week numbers could allegedly seal his fate at the iconic record label.</p>
      <blockquote>Dave East had a big album budget over $1 million dollars spent by Def Jam and right now its looking like a big L for Def Jam. First week sale projections are in and Dave East “Survival” album only sold 3,000 copies its first week. The album landed 164 on the billboard charts! People from Def Jam are telling us that the label is strongly considering to drop Dave East; because they are expecting to lose almost all of that $1 Million dollar Dave spent making this new album.

      <p>Earlier this week, reports claimed East’s new album <a href="https://twitter.com/BillboardAnR/status/1194733996665643008">sold around 3,000 units</a> in its first 7 days.</p>

      <p>Back in 2016, East <a href="https://djbooth.net/features/2019-11-14-dave-east-interview-survival-nipsey-hussle-legacy">signed a record contract</a> with Def Jam following an initial deal with rap veteran <b>Nas</b>‘ Mass Appeal Records.</p>
      <blockquote>In the summer of 2014, East signed to Nas’ Mass Appeal. With the label, he released <i>Hate Me Now </i>and <i>Kairi Chanel,</i> both essential pillars in his discography. Two years later, in 2016, East saw an opportunity to take another step forward, partnering with Def Jam for the release of his debut album. But instead of delivering his official introductory project, East released two entries in his <i>Karma </i>mixtape series, an EP entitled <i><a href="https://djbooth.net/features/2017-08-21-dave-east-paranoia-a-true-story-album-review">Paranoia: A True Story</a></i>, and <i>Beloved, </i>a collaborative project with fellow New York emcee Styles P. (DJ Booth)</blockquote>
      <p>A few years ago, East <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7533396/dave-east-nas-def-jam-kairi-chanel-release-party">explained his motivation</a> for signing with Def Jam.</p>
      <blockquote>“People don’t get signed by Def Jam every day on my block,” he relates. “I wouldn’t tell nobody to sign no slave deal or sign your life away or nothing like that, but if the deal is right and if it benefits you, you’d be a fool if you did not take advantage of it.” (Billboard)</blockquote>
