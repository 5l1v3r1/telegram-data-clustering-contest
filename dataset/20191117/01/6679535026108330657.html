      <p>A lioness, who was apparently hit by a vehicle in Gujarat’s Amreli district on November 15, died at the animal care centre here during treatment, a forest official said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The accident had occurred on Dedan-Khambha road near Bhavardi village under the Tulsishyam range of the Gir East division.</p>
      <p>The big cat, in the 3-5 year age-group, was admitted to the Jasadhar animal care centre, where it succumbed to injuries on Friday night, the official said.</p>
      <p>“The lioness was found inured on road near Bhavardi village. It was rescued by the field staff and taken to Jasadhar animal care centre,” he added.</p>
      <p>Prima facie, the big cat met with an accident either on early Friday morning or Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Forest officials are checking CCTV footage for a clue.</p>
      <p>There have been several cases of unnatural deaths of lions in the State, mainly from electrocution, falling into an open well, getting run over by trains, among others.</p>
