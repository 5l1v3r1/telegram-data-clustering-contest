      <p>A woman arrested for drink-driving after a car accident has been living in her car for six years, a court heard.</p>
      <p>Amanda Allerton, 27, was driving her Vauxhall Corsa when her car collided with a taxi near Abbey Hulton, Stoke-on-Trent.</p>
      <p>Police received a report of a minor road traffic collision and spotted Allerton's car driving along Leek Road and caught her drink-driving, <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/shes-been-living-car-six-3518042">Stoke-on-Trent Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Christy Woods told North Staffordshire Justice Centre: "It was stopped and the officer spoke to the defendant, who was driving the vehicle.</p>
      <p>"There were signs of intoxication and a roadside breath test was carried out."</p>

      <p>Allerton, who is living at the Salvation Army hostel, in Vale Street, Stoke, later gave a reading of 77 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath – more than double of the legal limit 35mg/100ml blood.</p>
      <p>She pleaded guilty to drink-driving and driving without insurance to the incident happened on October 20.</p>
      <p>The court heard she has a previous drink-drive conviction from 2014.</p>
      <p>Stephen Oldham, mitigating, said Allerton had been homeless for six years and living out of her car.</p>
      <p>Mr Oldham said: “During a lot of that time she has held down a job. She lost her job in July and she is waiting for surgery on her knee.</p>
      <p>"She has now lost her car as it was seized by police following this offence, but she has managed to get accommodation at the Salvation Army.</p>
      <p>"She is dealing with her anxiety and depression and a drink problem."</p>
      <p>Magistrates handed Allerton a £240 fine and ordered her to pay £135 court costs and a £32 victim surcharge.</p>
      <p>She was disqualified from driving for 36 months.</p>
