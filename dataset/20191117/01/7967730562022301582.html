      <p>American golfer Russell Henley has earned praise after copping a bizarre eight-stroke penalty that took him from the leaderboard to missing the cut at the US PGA Tour event in Mexico, as Jason Day had a day to forget.</p>
      <p>Harris English shot a seven-under 64 to take a one-shot, half-way lead over Vaughan Taylor on Saturday, but the big talking point was the whopping penalty imposed on Henley.</p>

      <p>The three-time tour winner was signing his used balls for fans when he realised one was a slightly different type of Titleist ProV1x than the rest and reported it to rules officials.</p>
      <p>Under the "One Ball Rule" used on most professional tours, golfers must use the same brand and make of ball throughout a round.</p>
      <p>Eight rules officials on site conferred for about an hour and a half and even consulted the USGA before imposing a two-shot penalty for each of the four holes Henley thought he'd used the ball on.</p>
      <p>After an opening 66, Henley's two-under 69 on Saturday turned into a 77 and he missed the cut by two shots.</p>
      <p>"It was a small dash, a different way [the ball] was marked that would have been easy to overlook," Tour rules official Brad Fabel said.</p>
      <p>"He came to us and said he didn't know how it had gotten in his bag."</p>
      <p>There was no question, Henley said, that he'd used the ball.</p>
      <p>He gives balls he's put into play to his caddie to mark accordingly, and the Pro V1x in question was marked as such.</p>
      <p>Henley believed he'd used it on holes 9, 10, 11 and 12, turning his four pars into double bogeys.</p>
      <p>The mix-up ends Henley's made cuts streak at eight, including the past four starts of last season and the first four of this season. He took the news well.</p>
      <p>"He was great," Fabel said. "I've got a ton of respect for that gentleman."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Day had a shocker as he prepared for next month's trip Down Under to contest the Australian Open and Presidents Cup.</p>
      <p>The former world No.1 racked up a a six-over-par 77 and missed the cut.</p>
      <p>Day needed one of captain Ernie Els' discretionary captains' picks last week to get into the 12-man International team, which will battle the United States in the Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne.</p>

      <p>He would be glad Els didn't get to ponder his triple bogey, double bogey and five bogeys on Saturday as he missed the half-way cut by five shots.</p>
      <p>The 77 was Day's worst score on the PGA Tour outside the four major championships since May 2017.</p>
      <p>Aaron Baddeley was the best of the Australians, tied 23rd after a 67 while Matt Jones (69, -2) also made the cut.</p>
