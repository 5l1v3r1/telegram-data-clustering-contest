      <h1>Tua Tagovailoa expected to make 'full recovery' from season-ending hip dislocation, per Alabama</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T01:25:50+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 01:25</time> by <a rel="author">Zac Al-Khateeb</a></address>
      <p>Tua Tagovailoa's season — and perhaps his career — is over at Alabama. But, according to a release from the university, the junior quarterback is "expected to make a full recovery" from the injury he suffered against Mississippi State on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa left right before halftime of Alabama's 38-7 win over the Bulldogs, unable to put any weight on his right leg. He was later airlifted to St. Vincent's Medical Center in Birmingham, Ala., to undergo further testing. According to a statement from team orthopedic surgeon Dr. Lyle Cain, the injury might not be as bad as initially thought.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“Tua Tagovailoa sustained a right hip dislocation that was immediately reduced at the stadium," Cain <a href="https://twitter.com/CecilHurt/status/1195869937975353345">said</a>. "He is undergoing further testing to determine the best course of treatment. He is expected to make a full recovery but will miss the remainder of the season.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/AaronSuttles/status/1195823008004227073">Aaron Suttles of The Athletic</a> reported that Tagovailoa also suffered a posterior wall fracture when he was tackled by two Mississippi State defenders. Alabama's statement does not make mention of said fracture; assuming Alabama's statement rules out such an injury, it is the best-case scenario for Tagovailoa as he looks to continue his career, either at Alabama or in the NFL.</p>
