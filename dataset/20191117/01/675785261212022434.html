      <p>A man shot and killed his wife and three of their sons before taking his own life in an apparent murder-suicide.</p>
      <p>Police arrived the home following a neighbour's report of a 'nail gun firing' on Saturday morning to find a young boy covered in blood inside the house in San Diego, California.</p>
      <p>They broke into the house and found a 29-year-old woman, her 31-year-old husband and three other boys - aged 5,9 and 11 - with apparent gunshots wounds.</p>
      <p>Both adults and a 3-year-old were pronounced dead at the scene, according to Lt. Matt Dobbs of the San Diego Police Department.</p>

      <p>Two other boys were pronounced dead at the hospital and the surviving boy was taken into emergency surgery in critical condition, the police said in a press conference.</p>
      <p>The age of the surviving child is not yet clear. The family has not been named.</p>
      <p>Dobbs said: "It's still very early in an investigation, but it appears to be a tragic case of a domestic violence murder-suicide."</p>
      <p>The mother had yesterday obtained a restraining order against the father but it's unclear if 'the order has been served', he added.</p>
      <p>It is understood that the man had visited the home in the morning and had argument before shooting the wife and the children then turning the gun on himself.</p>
      <p>The police ruled the incident as a domestic dispute involving one family.</p>
      <p>Police Chief David Nisleit said: "My heart goes out to the family and their friends.</p>
      <p>"As a husband and a father this incident is very difficult for me to even think about."</p>
      <p>The shooting happened on Paradise Hills, just a few blocks from an elementary school.</p>
      <p>Neighbours said they often saw the boys playing with their dog or riding bicycles outside, the <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/california/story/2019-11-16/5-found-dead-in-apparent-murder-suicide-in-san-diego">San Diego Union-Tribune</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Monica Montgomery, a San Diego councilwoman who represents Paradise Hills, called the killings an 'unfathomable tragedy'.</p>
      <p>"As this story makes national headlines, we all grapple with the horror of the loss of these precious lives," she said.</p>
