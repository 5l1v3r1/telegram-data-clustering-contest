      <p>There's something inexplicably wonderful about travelling that words cannot express. However, it's not easy to maintain one's health while travelling. When travelling, it's easy to munch on something that is readily available (which a lot of times, isn't the best idea) and many of us throw caution to the wind. Or, at other times, we might not have a choice, but to have samosas, parathas or a cheese sandwich from the roadside stall that will shoot the calorie count for the day into orbit. While it's not easy to avoid the temptation of local food, or skipping your exercise routine for just a few days - a small and easy step to manage your calorie intake is keeping healthy snacks handy! </p>

      <h4>Single Serving Oatmeal</h4>
      <p>Oats are one of the best available options when you crave for a portion of tasty food and don't want to compromise with your health. Oats is a reliable source of valuable dietary fibres and there are some really great oatmeal cups out there that taste good and are lower in sugar. Many of them are locally sourced, means they're promptly accessible. They're easy to pack and only need some boiling water to cook.</p>

      <h4>Salads</h4>
      <p>Like you prep with your luggage for travelling, it might be a good idea to prep a salad a night before you travel. They are a healthy snack that can last a few hours if you are travelling a short distance, like a sightseeing trip to a city. Team up corn, carrots, broccoli, tomatoes or slices of mango with dark leafy greens to make a super energizing snack. Stay away from those indulgent dressings though - you can pack some salt/ pepper with a slice of lemon to dress your salad just before you eat.</p>
