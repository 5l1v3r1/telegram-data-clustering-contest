      <h1>Alabama Releases Statement On Injury To QB Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T01:16:11+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 01:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Late in the first half of todayâ€™s Alabama win over Mississippi State, Tua Tagovailoa went down with a frightening hip injury. He was carted off the field, and taken by air transport to a hospital in Birmingham, Ala.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/AaronSuttles/status/1195823008004227073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1195823008004227073&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthespun.com%2Fsec%2Falabama-crimson-tide%2Fbreaking-tua-tagovailoa-is-reportedly-out-for-the-season">Aaron Suttles of The Athletic</a> reported that Tagovailoa <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/breaking-tua-tagovailoa-is-reportedly-out-for-the-season">suffered a dislocated right hip</a>. Moments ago, Alabama confirmed as much.</p>
      <p>As expected, Tagovailoa is out for the remainder of the season. The good news is that, per the statement from Dr. Lyle Cain, he is expected to make a full recovery.</p>

      <p>Where Tua Tagovailoa goes from here is a big question. He was expected to be a first-round pick, and potentially the first quarterback taken in the NFL Draft. The No. 1 overall pick was definitely a possibility.</p>
      <p>Now, it is unlikely that a team will take him that high. He could certainly still go in the first round if a team is looking to buy low and invest in him as he recovers, but this really changes his outlook in a big way.</p>
      <p>The biggest thing is that he will be okay though, whatever that means for his football career.</p>
      <p>We wish Tua the best in his recovery, and will have more on the situation as it comes out.</p>
