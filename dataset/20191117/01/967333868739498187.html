        <b>WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - US President Donald Trump has started his medical check-up to avoid wasting time during the 2020 presidential race, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said on Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>During the year 2020, the United States will hold the next presidential election.</p>
      <blockquote>"Anticipating a very busy 2020, the president is taking advantage of a free weekend here in Washington, D.C., to begin portions of his routine annual physical exam at Walter Reed [National Military Medical Center]", Grisham said in a statement.</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier in November, the Washington Examiner reported that a group of US medics <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911091077266054-donald-trump-health-medics-testimony/">is due to testify during House impeachment proceedings</a> against Trump that ''his mental health makes him dangerous and unfit for office''.</p>
      <p>Last time, President Trump had his physical exam in February 2019. At that time, his physician Sean Conley concluded that the US President is in "very good health".</p>
