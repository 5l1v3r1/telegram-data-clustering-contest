      <p><b>STARKVILLE, Miss.Â (AP)</b> - The Latest on Tua Tagovailoa's injury (all times local):</p>
      <p>7:13 p.m.</p>
      <p>Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa will miss the rest of the season with a hip injury he suffered late in the first half of the Crimson Tide's victory over Mississippi State on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa was injured while being dragged down late in the first half, with the Tide up four touchdowns, and No. 4 Alabama went on to beat Mississippi State 38-7.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa had been nursing an ankle injury and Alabama was considering holding him out of this game.</p>
      <p>Alabama officials confirmed Tagovailoa was flown by helicopter to the St. Vincent's Medical Center in Birmingham, Alabama. Hours later the school announced he has sustained a dislocated right hip.</p>
