      <h1>Trump 'backs Stephen Miller' amid accusations of racist ideology</h1>

      <p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> continues to support a White House adviser facing accusations of holding white nationalist views after a trove of his emails to a right-wing website were leaked this week, according to a new report.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/stephen-miller">Stephen Miller</a> has faced demands from prominent Democrats on Capitol Hill to resign from his post at the White House after the Southern Poverty Law Centre’s <i>Hatewatch</i> investigative team <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2019/11/12/stephen-millers-affinity-white-nationalism-revealed-leaked-emails">published an array of emails</a> he sent to <i>Breitbart</i>, while serving as an adviser to former Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, and later on the president’s 2016 campaign.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old encouraged a <i>Breitbart</i> reporter who shared the emails with <i>Hatewatch</i> to publish story angles in line with views espoused on white nationalist sites, often linking to them throughout his exchanges with the outlet’s editorial staff.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/stephen-miller-can-push-racist-crap-but-the-president-has-his-back?via=twitter_page"><i>Daily Beast</i></a> published a report citing an anonymous senior White House official who said Mr Trump continued to fully support Mr Miller in spite of the growing calls for him to leave the administration.</p>
      <p>“Stephen is not going anywhere,” the official reportedly told the news outlet. “The president has his back.”</p>
      <p>The emails were shared with Southern Poverty Law Centre by Katie McHugh, a <i>Breitbart</i> staffer and former right-wing figure who has since denounced the alt-right. She noted how Mr Miller would send her stories to right from popular sites among white supremacists, including one called American Renaissance.</p>
      <p>“I remember being stuck by the way he called it ‘AmRen,’ the nickname,” she told <i>Hatewatch</i>.</p>
      <p>Mr Miller appeared to frequent white nationalist sites and develop supporting material to back what critics say has become a hard-line, anti-immigrant agenda he now spearheads at the White House as the president’s go-to adviser on immigration.</p>
      <p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prominent New York Democrat elected to the US House of Representatives during the 2018 midterm elections, has shared a petition calling for the senior adviser’s dismissal from the White House, writing in a tweet on Friday: “He’s a verified White Supremacist controlling US immigration policy, which has now detained over 70,000 migrant children.”</p>
      <p>“This is not to be dismissed”, the congresswoman <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1195488129479847936?s=20">wrote</a>. “People’s lives are at risk.”</p>
      <p>Several Democrats running for the White House in 2020 have also called for Mr Miller’s resignation, from <a href="https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar/status/1195052305659371524?s=20">Amy Klobuchar</a> to Bernie Sanders, who <a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1194382146850476040?s=20">described</a> Mr Miller’s “white nationalist views” as “a danger to the American people” in a statement.</p>
      <p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
