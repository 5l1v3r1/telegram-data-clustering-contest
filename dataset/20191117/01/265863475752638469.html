      <h1>Jill Zarin Says She’ll Never Come Back To RHONY – Here’s Why!</h1>

      <p>Jill Zarin has no intention of ever coming back to the Real Housewives of New York and she made that very clear! While at BravoCon yesterday, the celeb chatted with HollywoodLife, telling the news outlet that the series that made her famous has no place in her future anymore.</p>
      <p>In other words, Zarin is ready to move on and is never looking back!</p>
      <p>As for the reason why she is never coming back after being part of the show for four seasons, she simply dished that ‘My time has come. My time has passed. It’s my choice. A little chill goes a long way, leave them [the viewers] wanting more. Leave when the party’s over, and leave them wanting more. I don’t want to overstay my welcome.’</p>
      <p>Furthermore, she insisted that her choice not to return has nothing to do with the current main Housewife of the series, Dorinda Medley, despite speculations that they had a fallout during Halloween.</p>
      <p>‘We got into it, but not about that. Definitely not. Dorinda and I are friends. I’m friends with all the girls. And I’m friends with LuAnn [de Lesseps] I’m friends with Sonja [Morgan]. You know, I’m in such a good place with all of them. Who wants to fight with anybody?’ Jill shared with the site.</p>
      <p>She then admitted that she did one more scene for RHONY and was happy about it but that’s about it!</p>
      <p>As for what’s in her future without the reality TV show, she mentioned her personal brands she’s been building as well as her happy relationship.</p>
      <p>Since she’s so very busy will all kinds of projects, she did mention that she has no time left for anything else in the entertainment industry – ‘certainly not TV’ – she exclaimed!</p>
