      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Minnesota's perfect season is no more! </p>
      <p>The Golden Gophers dropped their first game to the season in a 23-19 loss to Iowa on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Paired with the Badgers' win over Nebraska, Wisconsin is in control of its own destiny. </p>
      <p>If the Badgers can defeat Purdue at home next week and Minnesota on the road for the final game of the regular season, Wisconsin wins the Big Ten West. </p>
      <p>But if Illinois wins out, Minnesota loses out and Wisconsin loses to Purdue, Illinois wins the Big Ten West. </p>
      <p>But it's not done yet. </p>
      <p>Get ready for Camp Randall next Saturday for Senior Day. </p>
