      <p>Division 4 racer Vic Penrod became the final champion crowned in the NHRA Lucas Oil Drag Racing series when he clinched the Super Stock title on Sunday afternoon at the Auto Club NHRA Finals in Pomona. Penrod was not entered in the event, but officially earned the title when Kyle Rizzoli, his closest rival, lost in the semifinal round. Rizzoli had to win the event in order to clinch the title. In the deciding round, Rizzoli faced one of the toughest opponents imaginable in 104-time national event winner Dan Fletcher. In a race decided by just three-thousandths of a second at the finish line, Fletcher drove his ’69 Camaro to a 10.151 on his 10.13 dial while Rizzoli trailed with a 9.656 on his 9.64 prediction. It might have been a small consolation, but Rizzoli earlier reached the final round in Stock Eliminator.</p>
      <p>Penrod, of Walters, Okla., enjoyed a breakout season in 2019 when he drove his ’69 Camaro to national event victories in Chicago and Dallas. Penrod also won the Division 5 Lucas Oil Series event at Heartland Motorsports Park in Topeka and was a runner-up in Topeka at the Menard’s NHRA Heartland Nationals. Penrod was able to bounce-back from a tough DNQ at the Chevrolet Performance U.S. Nationals in Indy to post a 637-point score.</p>
      <p>Penrod joins championship class of 2019 that includes Megan Meyer (Top Alcohol Dragster), Sean Bellemeur (Top Alcohol Funny Car), Frank Aragona Jr. (Comp), Allison Doll (Stock), Ray Miller III (Super Comp), Jeremy Mason (Super Gas), Danny Nelson (Top Dragster presented by Racing RVs.com) and Sandy Wilkins (Top Sportsman presented by Racing RVs.com). Each of the sportsman champions will be officially recognized at tomorrow’s Lucas Oil Series awards banquet in Hollywood.</p>
