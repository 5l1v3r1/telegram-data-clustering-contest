      <p>The team was supposed to return on the 4th of November however, they were stopped as health authorities in New Caledonia had suspected that some players from other nations competing in the OFC Futsal Championship may have been infected by measles.</p>
      <p>There were concerns that some players in the Tongan team may have measles and Fiji had a match against the Tongan side in the pool stages of the OFC Futsal Championship.</p>
