      <p>They say life begins at 40 and for one of the finest producers in the media space, Brenda Antwi-Donkor, who celebrates her 40th birthday today, November 16, it is a good opportunity to try her hands at something new.<br/><br/>Brenda is an accomplished producer who has been in the producers for about two decades and worked with recognised institutions including Charterhouse, Viasat 1 and Atinka TV and has produced some of the best TV and reality shows this country has seen.<br/><br/>As a producer with Charterhouse, she worked on It Takes 2, the popular friendship building show, Agoro, the very first fun and prize-winning quiz show which aired on GTV, Star Beats of Brightness, a music and dance show and Rhythms.<br/><br/>In the area of reality TV shows, Brenda Antwi-Donkor is a giant. She produced and directed the Miss Malaika beauty pageant from 2004 – 2011 and Malta Guinness Street Dance Season 2 after Endomol left the production for Ghana.<br/><br/>When she joined Viasat 1 as the Head of OWN Productions, Brenda’s initiative saw her churn out two events, Man of the Year award and SingaloudwithKLM where the winners enjoyed a week-stay in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>She also helped turn the funny Jigwe Awards from a studio show into a beautiful outdoor well attended event.<br/><br/>Her recent stint as Head of Production at Atinka TV saw her successfully churning out the popular dance reality show, Di Asa, adding to her vast portfolio.<br/><br/>Brenda is a go-getter with a can-do attitude who has been an asset to any media organisation she has worked with.<br/><br/>Unearthing talent is one of her strongest assets and it is interesting to note that celebrity presenters such as Jessica Opare Saforo, Berla Mundi, Kwame Farkye were discovered by Brenda and the Charterhouse team.<br/><br/>She also unearthed talents such as Efya from her days of producing and directing Stars of the Future, Wiyaala from her production of Vodafone Icons as well as a host of other academic talents from her days on the Challenge reality show where she worked with current Information Minister, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah.<br/><br/>She's worked closely with other award-winning personalities such as Chairman General Kwami Sefa Kayi, Kokui Hanson, Patrice Amegashie, Kofi Okyere Darko of 1957, David Dontoh and Adjoa Yeboah Agyei.<br/><br/>Brenda credits the Holy Spirit for the inspiration for the ideas she comes up with. “The Holy Spirit drops them in my spirit so usually, people stand back and think my job is really very easy until they begin to wear my shoes. I love my job and I won’t trade it for anything else,” she said.<br/><br/>As she celebrates this important milestone today, Brenda told peacefmonline.com that it is the right time to venture into film production to showcase her growth.<br/>She expressed her gratitude to God for reaching 40. “I want to use this 40th birthday to thank God for all he's done and used me to so, my family for all the support given me, my friends and all the awesome bosses I have had as well as my colleagues. I look forward into the future with so much optimism,” she said.</p>
