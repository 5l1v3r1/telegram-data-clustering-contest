      <p>While preliminary results project an advantage for Mr. Rajapaksa, of the opposition Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP or People’s Party), the official said a clearer picture is likely by noon after votes polled in all districts have been counted.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rajapaksa’s principal rival Sajith Premadasa, fielded by the incumbent United National Party-led government, made huge gains in the north and east — home to a majority of Tamils and Muslims — where Mr. Rajapaksa fared poorly. However, it remains to be seen if the minority vote can compensate for what Mr. Premadasa could not garner in the Sinhala-majority south in the closely-fought race. His candidacy came amid a strong anti-incumbency sentiment in the electorate and widespread anger over the government’s failure to act on intelligence warnings prior to the Easter terror attacks.</p>
