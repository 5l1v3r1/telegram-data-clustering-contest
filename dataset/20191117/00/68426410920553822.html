      <p>Commuters in Metro Vancouver are being warned about service delays Monday and Tuesday due to an ongoing labour dispute.</p>
      <p>Transit operator TransLink says SeaBus service will experience service cancellations and the regular schedule will be reduced as unionized bus drivers implement an overtime ban.</p>
      <p>TransLink says SeaBus service will be cut to every 30 minutes on Monday and Tuesday, but morning and afternoon rush hours will see service every 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>The agency says commuters travelling between the North Shore and the city’s downtown core could be more likely to experience delays.</p>
      <p>Talks collapsed last week between Unifor, which represents bus drivers, mechanics and SeaBus operators, and Coast Mountain, which handles Lower Mainland transit on behalf of TransLink.</p>
      <p>The union says Coast Mountain remains unwilling to discuss wages, a key issue in the dispute, while Coast Mountain counters its proposal is well above increases offered to other public-sector workers in British Columbia.</p>
