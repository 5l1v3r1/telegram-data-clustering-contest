      <p><b><i>Joker</i> has now earned $1.017 billion worldwide as it nears $700 million overseas. <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> has just $233 million as <i>Maleficent: Mistress of Evil </i>has now earned $459 million global.</b>In holdover news, Roland Emmerich’s <i>Midway </i>earned $8.75 million (-51%) for a $35.14 million ten-day cume. That’s not a good hold, which is at least partially due to <i>Ford v Ferrari </i>stealing away the older male demographics, but Lionsgate was only on the hook for domestic and UK distribution and related marketing costs. A $50 million domestic finish will be squarely okay for the studio. Paramount’s <i>Playing With Fire</i>, $8.55 million (-33%) second weekend and $25.5 million ten-day cume. The Jon Cena kid-targeted flick cost $30 million, so this one will need decent overseas numbers to justify itself. But that’s an encouraging hold, even if <i>Frozen II </i>and <i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i> will likely crush its momentum next weekend.</p>

      <p>Paul Feig and Emma Thompson’s <i>Last Christmas </i>earned another $6.7 million (-41%) in its second weekend, giving it a mere $22.58 million ten-day cume. That sets up the Emilia Clarke/Henry Golding flick for a final domestic total of just-under $40 million. Unless it pulls <i>Love Actually </i>or <i>In Time </i>number overseas, and so far, it has just $35.58 million worldwide, it’s a whiff. Warner Bros.’ <i>Doctor Sleep </i>earned just $6.181 million (-56%) in its second weekend. That’ll give Mike Flanagan’s $45 million horror flick a $25.039 million ten-day total and a likely domestic finish of over/under $37 million. It has earned just $56 million worldwide. Audiences didn’t care about a sequel to <i>The Shining</i>. Once again, IP proved to be a repellent.</p>

      <p>Warner Bros. <i>Joker</i>, on the other hand, earned another $13 million overseas (-39%) to give it a $694 million foreign total. It earned $5.635 million (-39%) in North America for a new $322.599 million cume, putting it  above the raw domestic grosses of <i>The Fellowship of the Ring </i>($313 million in 2001), <i>Thor: Ragnarok </i>($315 million in 2017) <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone </i>($317 million in 2001) and <i>Iron Man </i>($318 million in 2008). The film’s new global cume is $1.017 billion worldwide, well above the unadjusted global cume of <i>The Dark Knight </i>($1.004 billion in 2008) to make it DC’s third-biggest global grosser behind <i>The Dark Knight Rises </i>($1.081 billion) and <i>Aquaman </i>($1.148 billion). It should end with around $1.06 billion.</p>

      <p>Walt Disney’s <i>Maleficent: Mistress of Evil </i>earned $5.2 million (-40%) domestic and $11.8 million (-44%) overseas for a new cume of $106 million in North America, $352.9 million overseas and $458.9 million global. That’s just under arbitrary 2.5x “break even” point. It may not be a super smash, but it’ll eventually break even (and possibly turn a profit) over the long haul as it makes its way to $500 million global. Moreover, to the extent that the ten million (or more) Disney+ subscribers missed this one in theaters, it’ll be an A-level premiere when it pops up on the streaming service next year. It could (in terms of current exchange rates) end up above the $382 million overseas cume of the first <i>Maleficent</i>.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Focus Features’ <i>Harriet </i>earned $4.78 million (-36%) in its third weekend, giving it a solid $31.882 million 17-day cume. This one has shown strong legs, as befitting its A+ Cinemascore grade, and I wouldn’t count Cynthia Erivos out of the Oscar race just yet. In other Oscar news, Fox Searchlight’s <i>Jojo Rabbit </i>expanded to 995 theaters for a $2.818 million (-33%) fifth weekend and $13.597 million domestic cume. I still think this crowd-pleasing Taika Waititi dramedy, set in Europe at the very end of World War II, ends up as an Oscar front runner, because A) it’s playing well with consumers and would-be voters and B) Disney is going to push it hard to show that Fox movies can still win Oscars under the Walt Disney umbrella.</p>

      <p>Skydance’s <i>Terminator: Dark Fate </i>earned another $4.375 million (-59%) third weekend and miserable $56.885 million domestic and $233 million global cume. It’s a whiff for Paramount and for Fox/Disney. <i>Zombieland: Double Tap </i>has earned $70.393 million domestic and $111.093 million worldwide on a $42 million budget. <i>Parasite </i>will earn $1.935 million (-25%) for a robust $14.493 million domestic and $111 million worldwide cume. Yes, this one is still in the thick of the awards race. <i>Black &amp; Blue </i>is no big hit, but the terrific Deon Taylor-directed action drama, starring Naomi Harris and Tyrese Gibson, will cross $20 million domestic tonight. <i>Motherless Brooklyn </i>had a decent hold in weekend two, but it lost 731 theaters in weekend three and tumbled 76% for a $500,000 weekend and $8.814 million ten-day cume.</p>
