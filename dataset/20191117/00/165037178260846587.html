        <b>John Marshall stated in declarations with 'Express and Star' that Ruben Neves is totally off the market. The head of the coaching body at the club is a very authoritative figure and his words could stop any future negotiations from taking place.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The midfielder has become a key part of the recently promoted team </b>and has already received interest from other clubs in England.<b> The latest being Liverpool</b>, who once again showed their interest in signing him, but there was no offer in the summer.</p>
      <p><b>For three seasons now he has been essential for his club. </b>He nearly always appears in the starting XI and has been highly revalued. Recently, <b>he scored a goal that showed his quality</b> with the ball in his feet despite his defensive cut.</p>

      <p>His exit price is <b>around 65 million euros.</b> But, what's the reason for this reason? Apart from the good performances he has had all season, for his age. <b>He is 22-years-old</b>, which means that he would be a great investment for the future.</p>
      <p>Moreover, <b>he has a contract with the club until 2023</b>, which means his owners have the bull by its horns when deciding whether to keep him, or to let him go.<b> It would be vitalÂ for the player</b> to ask to leave in order to speed up conversations with other clubs.</p>
