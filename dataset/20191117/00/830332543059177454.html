      <p>HOUSTON (CNN) - Kanye West left inmates in tears when he performed a surprise concert at the Harris County jail in Houston, Texas.</p>
      <p>The Grammy award-winning rapper and his choir performed songs from his gospel album "Jesus is King" on Friday as inmates waved their hands and knelt in prayer.</p>
      <p>West <a href="https://twitter.com/SheriffEd_HCSO/status/1195467034471096327">said</a> his visit was "a mission, not a show," according to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez.</p>
      <p>West performed for more than 200 male inmates before using an underground tunnel to access a separate jail to perform for a smaller crowd of women inmates, according to the <a href="https://twitter.com/HoustonChron/status/1195475813749198848">Houston Chronicle</a>.</p>
      <p>"Say what you want about the man," said Jason Spencer, a public affairs director for the Harris County Sheriff's Office. "But Kanye West and his choir brought some light to people who needed it today at the Harris County Jail."</p>
      <p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted on Saturday that it would be "great if other artists followed Kanye's lead."</p>
      <p>"What Kanye West does to inspire the incarcerated is transformative," <a href="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX">Abbott</a> said. "Saving one soul at a time. Inmates who turn to God may get released earlier [because] of good behavior &amp; may be less likely to commit future crimes."</p>
      <p>West is <a href="https://www.lakewoodchurch.com/schedule">scheduled</a> to speak with Joel Osteen and his Lakewood Church congregation on Sunday. He will hold his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/16/us/kanye-west-lakewood-church-ticket-scalping-trnd/index.html">"Sunday Service" performance</a> inside the church later that evening,</p>
