      <p>Farooq Kperogi, a critic and commentator, has claimed that four<br/>relatives of Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari are actively working<br/>in Aso Rock, transmuting from being paupers to enjoying a presidential<br/>treatment.<br/><br/>Many Nigerians are of the view that nepotism is a form of corruption.<br/><br/>Kperogi, a professor of Journalism and Emerging Media at Kennesaw<br/>State University (in the United States) in a Twitter thread, said the<br/>quartet had transmuted from paupers before President Buhari's<br/>assumption of office in 2015 to persons of affluence.<br/><br/>Kperogi listed the names of the four as Abdulkarim Dauda, Sabiu<br/>'Tunde' Yusuf, Dauda 'Zeze' Habu, and Musa Haro.<br/><br/>"I've confirmed these names from multiple sources in Daura and the<br/>Presidential Villa: 1. Abdulkarim Dauda. He is Buhari’s Personal Chief<br/>Security Officer (PCSO). Like Mamman Daura, he is Buhari’s nephew. His<br/>father, Dauda Daura, is Buhari's half-brother from the same father. He<br/>is de facto president Mamman Daura’s full biological brother.<br/><br/>"I exposed a recent secret memo Buhari sent to the Nigeria Police<br/>(where Abdulkarim is officially employed as Commissioner of Police<br/>after 3 unnaturally rapid promotions in three years) instructing it to<br/>circumvent time-honored public service rules &amp; extend his service till<br/>2023 even though he should've retired this year on account of being in<br/>d police for 35 yrs," he stated.<br/><br/>The tweet continued, "2. Sabiu “Tunde” Yusuf. He's Buhari’s, Private<br/>Secretary. Don’t be deceived by the “Tunde” in his name. It’s just a<br/>nickname, probably inspired by Tunde Idiagbon, Buhari’s deputy when he<br/>was a military dictator. Sabiu is the son of Mamman Daura’s full<br/>biological sister by the name of Hajia Halima (more popularly known as<br/>“Hajja Madam” in Daura) who died last year. As you should know by now,<br/>Mamman Daura’s sister is Buhari’s niece since their father (Dauda<br/>Daura) is Buhari’s much older half-brother.<br/><br/>"Sabiu, who is in his 30s, is one of the most powerful people in<br/>Nigeria today. He determines who sees and who doesn’t see Buhari. Only<br/>Mamman Daura and Abba Kyari can overrule him. By several accounts, he<br/>is now a billionaire, although he had no formal work experience before<br/>Buhari became president. He used to sell recharge cards in Daura until<br/>2015!"<br/><br/>Tweeting further, Kperogi noted: "3. Dauda “Zeze” Habu. He's Senior<br/>Personal Assistant to Abba Kyari, the de facto acting president/VP.<br/>His father, Habu Kurma, is Mamman Daura's younger brother. (Kurma is<br/>the Hausa word for deaf. He’s called Kurma because he’s deaf, but this<br/>isn’t derogatory in Hausa culture where people are habitually<br/>identified by their disability).<br/><br/>"4. Musa Haro. He is PA (Domestic Affairs) to Buhari. His mother,<br/>Hajia Kwalla, is Buhari’s biological sister. Hajia Kwalla is a twin.<br/>Her twin sister is called Hajia Amadodo. My friends from Daura told me<br/>last week that Musa “ just bribed the Emir of Daura to be conferred<br/>with the traditional title of Dan Madamin Daura."<br/><br/>Kperogi mentioned two other names of Buhari's relatives currently<br/>serving in his regime.<br/><br/>He explained in his tweet, "Bonus: 5. Ahmed Rufa'i Zakari. He's<br/>Special Adviser to the President on Infrastructure. He isn’t Buhari’s<br/>biological relative, but he is his relative by marriage and informal<br/>adoption. Ahmed’s mother is Mrs. Amina Zakari, the controversial INEC<br/>commissioner who, along with compromised INEC chairman Mahmood Yakubu,<br/>helped Buhari to rig the 2019 election.<br/><br/>"Buhari’s older sister was married to Amina Zakari’s father, the late<br/>Alhaji Hussaini Adamu. Apart from being Buhari’s in-law, the late<br/>Hussaini Adamu also raised Buhari for some time after Buhari’s father<br/>died, so he was, in a sense, Buhari’s adoptive father."<br/><br/>Speaking further, the vocal critic of Buhari's regime said, in the<br/>tweet: "6. The House of Representatives member representing the<br/>Daura/Sandamu/MaiAdua Federal constituency by the name of Fatihu<br/>Muhammad is the son of Buhari’s older brother by the name of Muhammadu<br/>"Mamman" Danbafale.<br/><br/>"Fatihu became the APC candidate without “proper primary,” as a source<br/>told me. Also remember that Buhari created an entire ministry for his<br/>dabino-stealing former mistress, Ms. Sadiya Umar Farouq. I doubt that<br/>there’s any parallel in Nigeria’s history for the magnitude and<br/>severity of nepotism and personalization of power that we’re seeing<br/>now."<br/> </p>
