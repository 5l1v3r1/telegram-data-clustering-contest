      <p>Well, I didn’t know how fast I would end up beating <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/16/jedi-fallen-order-is-definitely-babys-first-dark-souls-but-in-a-good-way/"><i>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</i></a>, as I didn’t get a review code. There are always conspiracy theories that companies don’t give out codes when they think someone might give them a lower score than average, but while I don’t know if that’s what happened here, joke’s on you EA, I loved it!Seriously, <i>Fallen Order</i> is a truly incredible game and a massive achievement by Respawn, who has been killing it with like, every title they release, and it’s wild they can make a multiplayer game as good as <i>Apex Legends</i> and a single player game as good as <i>Fallen Order</i>. In the same year!</p>
      <p>I did end up beating the game in two days, so I figure it’s still early enough to write my advice post, because Xbox is telling me only 2.5% of players have beaten the campaign at this point. So here we go, here are ten things I wish I knew when I started <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. How Long It Takes</b>
      </p>
      <p>When I said I beat it, the first thing everyone asked me was how long it took. The answer is probably around 24-26 hours, if I had to guess. That was not me “sprinting” through it either, as I got probably about 75-90% exploration on all planets. This was a “normal” difficulty playthrough, which means I didn’t have to re-do a bunch of segments as many times as people playing on higher difficulties. All in all, I would put it on par with the length of a game like <i>God of War</i>, not really <i>Dark Souls</i> which takes a lot longer (and mostly because of so much trial and error).</p>

      <p>
        <b>2. Which Difficulty Should You Play?</b>
      </p>
      <p>This really depends on your own specific tastes. I am not a Soulslike player, but I am hearing that those kinds of players are having a fine time putting it on Jedi Master and doing a tough playthrough. I would say I was comfortable on normal difficulty, as I still had plenty of harrowing moments and it didn’t feel like a breeze. I play most games on normal the first time, and this was no exception. The “correct” answer here may be one notch above normal, as a hard playthrough may better strike the balance between fun and challenge if you think normal veers too much into easy territory. But I don’t regret it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Don’t Get Super Consumed Exploring Too Early</b>
      </p>
      <p>I know that every time you get a new force power, you will be tempted to run back to every single planet you’ve been to in order to try and unlock new areas. While sure, you can do this, I wouldn’t worry about it too much. The game sends you back to each major planet at least 2-3 times for various story beats, and it’s a natural way to explore without dedicating time <i>solely</i> to exploring old zones. With this method, I got about 75% completion and to answer your next question, yes, you can keep exploring after the game ends, although this is one of those “save point right before the final mission” situations rather than playing after the last segment. But it still works. Similarly, I would not worry about farming for XP, killing enemies, saving, respawning them, and repeating, because you really will end up with a ton of XP playing naturally by the end (though I did not finish the entire skill tree, I’ll say that).</p>

      <p>
        <b>4. The Best Offensive Skills</b>
      </p>
      <p>While lightsaber fighting is cool, for my money, I would invest heavily in every upgrade you can get for both your force push and pull skills. A major force push can knock entire groups of lesser enemies off edges, and bigger, individual enemies as well. A major force pull works against pretty much every kind of enemy, and it can do thinks like one-shot certain enemies by pulling them toward you and then running your saber through them. Though I would definitely upgrade enough lightsaber skills eventually to unlock the 3 point one that just flat-out increases your saber damage. Overrated skills include the freeze time one and the lightsaber throw, which seems cool but isn’t all that useful in practice.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. The Best Defensive Skills</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stack life, as I do in any game that lets me upgrade my health. Upgrade the module that lets you get more health from BD-1 stims. I also really liked the upgrade that allows you to get full force recharge on stim. One skill I regret not getting was the one that gives you slow-mo and force recharge on a perfectly timed dodge. Make sure you get the one that increases your block recharge and parry timing. I never upgraded some random ones like sprinting to deflect blaster bolts (sprinting is too inconsistent in this game anyway).</p>

      <p>
        <b>6. You Can Get a Specific Secret Weapon Very Early</b>
      </p>
      <p>I don’t want to go too much into this, because some many consider it a spoiler. I actually wrote a separate guide just for this point, where Cal can get a secret weapon early on in the game before you’re “supposed” to get it. If you want to know what it is and how to get it, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/17/jedi-fallen-order-where-to-get-the-double-bladed-lightsaber-early/">you can read that guide here</a>. I personally would do it, as the sooner you get it, the better, for reasons that will become clear.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7. Chests Are Neat But Mostly Useless</b>
      </p>
      <p>Every map has a ton of hidden chests scattered on the map but really, they’re not all that useful as they contain nothing but cosmetics which I do not find terribly good. It’s just different ponchos for Cal, or lightsaber pieces you will never really see, or paint colors for your ship you will also not see. Rather, the secret things you want to be looking for are items for BD-1 to scan, as those give you good XP, and for secret, hidden boss fights which <i>really</i> give you good XP. Do not be afraid to locate those, fail them, then come back later when you are 300% stronger to destroy them. I did that with many of the minibosses I found and I regret nothing, the XP is still good.</p>
      <p>
        <b>8. Don’t Go Too Crazy Trying To Get Places You Can’t Yet</b>
      </p>
      <p>I also gave this advice during <i>God of War</i>. The game makes it pretty clear when you cannot progress in a certain zone. If you look at the map, it will highlight an object in red that makes it clear you simply cannot access it. If you can’t make a jump or move a platform, you really are not supposed to be able to yet. As I said, you will probably come back to that area later with those skills in hand, so don’t stress about it too much.</p>

      <p>
        <b>9. Two Key Skills Don’t Unlock Until Very Late</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you think that jumping is clunky or that climbing is slow in <i>Fallen Order</i>, you are correct. But there’s also a reason for that. Without getting into story detail, I will say that you eventually unlock the double jump “Jedi Flip” late in the story which really helps jumping to feel better. You also unlock a device that lets you climb a lot faster than you normally do, which is similarly useful. You just have to wait a while.</p>
      <p>
        <b>10. Parry, Parry, Parry, Parry</b>
      </p>
      <p>Seriously, you will have a much, much better time if you don’t treat this game like <i>Force Unleashed</i>, even on normal. Use parry and dodge frequently, don’t just hack away at enemies. You will not only make it out of more encounters unscathed, but the better you become at this kind of combat, the more cinematic the entire experience will be. And while maybe you can bumble through normal enemies swinging wildly, there are some very, very tough bosses later in the game that will force you to actually be able to precision parry and dodge, and you won’t get past them without doing that.</p>
      <p>Hope this helps! Enjoy.</p>
