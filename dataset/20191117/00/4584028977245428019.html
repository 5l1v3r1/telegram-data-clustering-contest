      <h1>Griezmann admits Barcelona &amp;#039;not the easiest place to play&amp;#039; but confident for the future</h1>

      <p>Antoine Griezmann accepts his integration to life at Barcelona has not been easy but remains convinced he will be successful at Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>After over a year of speculation and transfer rumours, Barca finally secured the signing of Griezmann from Atletico Madrid, triggering his €120million release clause.</p>
      <p>While his haul of four LaLiga goals and three assists in 11 matches is hardly alarming, Griezmann's performances have generally failed to inspire much excitement from fans, leaving them somewhat underwhelmed.</p>
      <p>It was thought the forward's arrival would alleviate some of the pressure on talisman Lionel Messi, but the Argentina superstar continues to shoulder much of the creative burden.</p>
      <p>After Barca coach Ernesto Valverde recently suggested the Frenchman still needs to adapt to the team's style of play, Griezmann is confident of improving with time and has no doubts over his decision to join Barca.</p>
      <p>"Barcelona is not the easiest place [to play]," he said in an interview with Telefoot. "It's a new team, a different club, new tactics and a new position and role for me. But it is what it is and it's time to work.</p>
      <p>"I'm proud of the decision and where I am, and it will be the work that sorts everything. Trust me and everything will good.</p>
      <p>"My goal now is to be an important player in the club, have more minutes, score more goals, make decisive passes, qualify in the Champions League and be up there in the league, be ready for the national team [France] in March and also for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>"I'm a player who thinks about the team. I can score many goals, but that is not my main goal. My goal is to help the team in any way I can."</p>
