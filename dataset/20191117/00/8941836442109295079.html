      <p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - New Mexico’s largest electric utility is reaching out to vendors and energy companies around the world for ideas as it works toward going emissions-free.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/public-service-company/">Public Service Company</a> of New Mexico announced Friday it’s seeking information on the types of resources and emerging technologies capable of helping it reach the goal.</p>
      <p>That ranges from storage systems and carbon emissions controls to hydrogen technologies.</p>
      <p>New Mexico earlier this year adopted renewable energy mandates that call for zero emissions by 2045. PNM vows to beat that deadline by five years.</p>
      <p>The utility is seeking indicative pricing for modeling and analysis purposes. Separate requests for proposals are possible in the future.</p>
