          <p>One of the surest ways to score a goal in a football match are penalties. With the ball but a few meters away from the goal and no one in between but a solitary goalkeeper, the chances of the ball getting in the net is much higher than it staying out.</p>

                <p>The penalties are usually designated to the cleanest hitters of the ball, mostly the strikers, sometimes the midfielders and even the defenders on some occasions. However, very rarely does a goalkeeper step up to take the spot-kick responsibility.</p>
                <p>However, in the Southern League match between Nuneaton Borough and Stratford Town, this is exactly what happened. With the score level at 0-0, Nuneaton Town were given a penalty. The fans though, were left perplexed when their stopper stood up to take the shot. What he did next contributed very little in calming their nerves.</p>

                      <p>The keeper, who had played as a sweeper keeper for most of the match, clearly fancied himself up to the task. However, his optimism was proven wrong instantly. During his kick, the keeper looked to be off balance and kicked the ball with a little too much power.</p>
                      <p>The ball then completely missed the keeper, the goal, the crossbar and everything in sight; well except the light in the stands which would immediately fall.</p>

                            <p>Fortunately for the keeper, the miss did not cost his side much. Nuneaton Borough went on to win the match 2-0. However, it is unlikely that the stopper will take another penalty any time soon.</p>
