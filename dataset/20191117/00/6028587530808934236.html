      <h1>Why China’s Consumers Will Keep Creating New Billionaires</h1>

      <p>Consumer-focused entrepreneurs are some of the top standouts on the 2019 Forbes China Rich List published earlier this month on Nov. 7. Among them China sportswear leader Anta Sports’ CEO Ding Shizhong. whose fortune more than doubled from a year earlier (see list overview <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2019/11/06/chinas-richest-2019-growing-consumer-appetite-boosts-fortunes-of-nations-wealthiest/#77342e5016c5">here</a>). Charles Lu, chairman of newly U.S.-listed Luckin Coffee debuted as a billionaire as his chain raced to out-compete Starbucks in the world's second-largest economy. Luckin’s CEO Jenny Qian also joined the world’s billionaires ranks on Nov. 15 after a 25% surge in Luckin’s shares (see story <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2019/11/16/starbucks-china-rival-luckin-coffee-mints-a-second-billionaire/#41a0cfd32b86">here</a>). What are some of the forces propelling China's consumer spending and the fortunes of entrepreneurs tied to it? </p>
      <p> China has for years been called "the world's best consumer story" by Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia. And though the country’s GDP growth rate has declined of late, there's no reason for that longer-term trend to reverse.</p>
      <p> One reason is savings, an indicator of ability to spend. China’s household savings has been in the neighborhood of 27%, compared to only 8% in the U.S., Rothman noted in his Oct. 18 "Sinology" newsletter.  </p>
      <p>Another reason is the sheer size of China's overall economy today. Though the percentage increase in China's consumption has eased, the spending that goes along with it is still huge. The dollar value of retail spending in China was 91% of the U.S. total, compared with 36% a year earlier, Rothman points out. </p>
      <p>China is more interesting from an investment point of view, however, because its inflation-adjusted growth in retail sales in Jan.-Sept. was 6.4% compared with 1.6% in America. </p>
      <p>Technology change is enriching big e-commerce platforms like Alibaba Group, whose former chairman Jack Ma ranked no. 1 on the new list with a fortune of $38.2 billion, up from $34.6 billion a year earlier, as well as delivery platform Meituan, whose chairman Wang Xing’s fortune increased to $7.4 billion from $5.1 billion a year earlier.</p>
      <p>China’s e-commerce boom is shaking up its logistics industry and creating new wealth there, too. Lai Meisong, CEO of Alibaba-backed express delivery firm ZTO, saw his fortune climbed to $4.6 billion from $3.35 billion a year earlier. Alibaba, not one to miss out on big industry trends, said this month it would invest another $3.3 billion in its logistics arm, Cainiao.</p>
      <p>The launch of high-speed 5G telecommunication services, driven in part by controversial telecommunication giant Huawei Technologies and its billionaire chairman Ren Zhengfei, promise new forms of spending in the coming years.  Those winners are likely to be the among the names that we'll be highlighting on the Forbes China Rich List in the years to come.   </p>
