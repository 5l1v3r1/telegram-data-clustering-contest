      <p>The Indian fast bowling trio of Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav took 14 wickets between them to help their team defeat Bangladesh by an innings and 130 runs in the first Test.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh, who had opted to bat, were bowled out for 150 in the first innings as the fast bowlers wreaked havoc on a lively pitch. With India having posted 493/6 on the back of Mayank Agarwal's double-century before declaring, the quicks fired again, to shoot the visitors out for 213 in the second innings.</p>
      <p>According to Ishant, part of the reason for India's success in the fast bowling department in recent times is the chemistry between the pacers.</p>

      <p>"I am not treated as a senior, we don't have anything like that [junior/senior mindset]. We always enjoy each other’s success, speak with each other and try and share our plans. It’s healthy competition," he told <i>Star Sports.</i></p>
      <p>Ishant stressed on the fact that the Indian bowlers don't attach too much importance to the hierarchy within the fast bowling department but instead help each other improve.</p>
      <p>"But at the same time, if you enjoy each others' success, and whatever you spot of the others' bowling you go and tell them, things become much easier as a team," he added.</p>

      <p>Reiterating the sentiment, Shami also sheds light on the friendship between the bowlers. "We keep trying to pump each other up, and keep pushing each other, all the fast bowlers. It's a difficult job, but we push each other, we joke with each other, that feels very nice. When we are on the ground together, we never feel like we aren't enjoying others' success. That's special."</p>
      <p>Yadav, who was playing only his third Test this year, performed equally well in Indore, supporting Ishant and Shami with his economical and incisive bowling. The 32-year-old feels that bowling together and sharing plans has helped the seamers change the face of Indian fast bowling.</p>
      <p>"Earlier pacers would bowl only a few overs and then the spinners would come on with turning tracks. But the way all the bowlers are bowling together, we know what our strong point is, what our areas are and we plan that way," he said.</p>

      <p>"We try, for the first 10-15 overs or how much ever we bowl, if we can each take a wicket, then it'll be better for our spinners. And our confidence is high since we'll get to bowl again. If we take wickets, we'll get more bowling, which is good for us."</p>
      <p> India, who have now taken a 1-0 lead in the two-match series, will play the second Test on Friday, 22 November in Kolkata. It will be their first day/night Test.</p>
