      <p>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) - Springfield’s communications director has been suspended after she was arrested at the MGM Springfield casino and charged with property destruction.</p>
      <p>The Republican newspaper reports that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marian-sullivan/">Marian Sullivan</a> was arrested at the downtown casino around 3 a.m. Sunday. State police say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marian-sullivan/">Sullivan</a> damaged property at a casino restaurant and vandalized cars in a parking garage. A police spokesman said she appeared to be intoxicated.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear if <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marian-sullivan/">Sullivan</a> has obtained an attorney.</p>
      <p>Mayor Domenic J. Sarno said he was “shocked and very disturbed” by the arrest. He said he’s hopeful <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marian-sullivan/">Sullivan</a> “will seek the help that she seems to need.”</p>
      <p>Sarno said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marian-sullivan/">Sullivan</a> will be suspended until her case has gone through the court process. He referred other questions to his chief of staff, who declined to comment.</p>
