      <p>The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), on November 17, announced that it will file a review petition in the Supreme Court of India (SC) against the Ayodhya land dispute case verdict.</p>
      <p>"We have decided to file a review petition in the SC. Since the SC, in its judgement, said that the mosque was not built by demolishing a temple, still the mosque was not given to us. So, we will file a review petition and ask for what is rightfully ours," Arshad Madani of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind said, according to News18.</p>
      <p>The AIMPLB held a meeting, on November 17, to decide whether it should seek a review of the apex court's verdict.</p>

      <p>According to news agency PTI, the decision was taken after the Jamiat's highest decision-making body, the working committee, gave its nod for filing the review petition following extensive deliberations involving lawyers and experts.</p>
      <p>The panel under the chairmanship of Madani delved into the prospects of a review petition challenging the apex court verdict, a statement by Jamiat said.</p>
      <p>The expert panel observed that the judgement was against the Muslim parties and it was not a final judgement as the option of reviewing it is available under the Constitution of India, it said.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/ayodhya-verdict-full-text-of-supreme-courts-judgment-in-the-ram-janmabhoomi-babri-masjid-land-dispute-case-4622341.html">unanimous verdict</a> on November 9, the top court had cleared the way for the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. The court had also directed the Centre to allot a "suitable" five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
      <p>The AIMPLB also said that it cannot accept the five-acre plot.</p>
      <p>Soon after the verdict, the AIMPLB had expressed dissatisfaction and said that the board was contemplating seeking the judgement's review.</p>
      <p>The Sunni Waqf Board, a party in the Ayodhya land dispute, had welcomed the verdict and had said thatÂ it will not file any review or curative petition on the verdict.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
