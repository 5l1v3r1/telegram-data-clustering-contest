      <blockquote>“In addition, the company instructed its Depositary Bank to implement a ratio change for its American Depositary Shares (ADSs). The new ratio will be 10 Class A ordinary shares per one ADS. The company expects the effective date for the ratio change will be on or around December 2, 2019; however, the exact date could change depending on the timing of SEC approval.”</blockquote>
      <p>China Rapid Finance also revealed that Dr. Po Wang will now focus on new business development in order to accelerate the Company’s growth and planned return to profitability. As a result, Dr. Wang’s title was changed from Co-CEO to Executive Vice-President, New Ventures. The company added:</p>
      <blockquote>“Dr. Wang will remain on the Board as an executive director. A key element of the Company’s recovery plan is to partner with multiple financial services enterprises that can leverage the Company’s “decision-making” technology to better serve their large customer bases.”</blockquote>
