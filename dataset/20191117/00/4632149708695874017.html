      <h1>Defending champion Zverev reaches ATP semis, while inspired Tsitsipas conquers Federer to enter final</h1>

      <p>Rafael Nadal headed home from the ATP Finals after defending champion Alexander Zverev's win against Daniil Medvedev confirmed the Spaniard's exit from the season-ending tournament. <br/><br/>Earlier, the world number one recovered to beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7 (4/7), 6-4, 7-5 in the early round-robin match at London's O2 Arena but knew he was dependent on the later result. <br/><br/>Zverev's 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) win on Friday meant he qualified for the semi-finals from Group Andre Agassi alongside Tsitsipas. <br/><br/>Tsitsipas, who topped the group, will play six-time champion Roger Federer in Saturday's semi-finals while Zverev will meet Dominic Thiem, who finished ahead of Federer in Group Bjorn Borg. <br/><br/><b>Early break</b> <br/><br/>German seventh seed Zverev broke the fourth-seeded Medvedev early, with the Russian knowing he was already heading out of the tournament after two defeats. <br/><br/>But Medvedev dug deep in the second set, fending off the single break point engineered by Zverev and took it to a tie-break. <br/><br/>The pair swapped mini-breaks but Medvedev double-faulted to give Zverev a 5-3 lead and the German held his nerve to seal his first match point with an ace. <br/><br/>"I'm in the semis again, this arena is where I play my best tennis," said Zverev. "We don't play in this atmosphere anywhere else in the world. <br/><br/>"Today because Daniil had nothing to lose he could just enjoy it, but for me it was must-win. He's been the best player since the summer so all credit to him." <br/><br/>Nadal assured of No. 1 <br/><br/>Zverev, who beat Novak Djokovic in the final last year, has had a mixed season but now has the chance to end it on a high in London. <br/><br/>Nadal, who has already secured the year-end number one ranking, has never won the end-of-season tournament and had a miserable start at the O2 Arena, being outplayed by Zverev in his opening match. But the 19-time Grand Slam champion produced an astonishing comeback to defeat Medvedev on Wednesday and give himself a chance of qualifying from the round-robin phase. <br/><br/>Tsitsipas, 21, had already qualified for the semi-finals before Friday's match after beating Medvedev and Zverev. <br/><br/>Following his win Nadal was in the strange position of not knowing whether he would qualify for the knockout rounds or not. <br/><br/>Tsitsipas beats Federer <br/><br/>Stefanos Tsitsipas stunned favourite Roger Federer to reach the final on his debut at the ATP Finals on Saturday, beating the six-time champion 6-3 6-4 at the O2 Arena. <br/><br/>The stylish 21-year-old, the first Greek to qualify for tournament in half a century, soaked up everything Federer threw at him and returned it with interest to subdue the Swiss great. <br/><br/>Federer, 17 years older than his opponent, was unusually profligate when his chances came along, failing to convert his first 10 break points. Federer looked jaded near the end and struggled to hold serve at 3-5, but at least asked the question of Tsitsipas's nerve, but to no avail.</p>
