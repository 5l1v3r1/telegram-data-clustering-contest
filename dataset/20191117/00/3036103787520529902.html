      <h1>Why you should cover your webcam</h1>

      <p>Many security experts are concerned about the possible privacy breaches that could occur through devices like webcams.</p>
      <p>Webcams have been around since the early 1990s, and many of these devices are vulnerable to unauthorised access, either due to a lack of built-in security features or negligent behaviour by the user.</p>
      <p>When Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted a picture celebrating Instagram reaching half a billion monthly active users in June 2016, observers spotted tape over his laptop’s camera and microphone.</p>
      <p>Former FBI director James Comey was once mocked about putting tape over his webcam, but he pointed out that the approach was not as unconventional as people thought.</p>
      <p>“You go into any government office and we all have the little camera things that sit on top of the screen. They all have a little lid that closes down on them,” Comey said.</p>
      <p>If well-known security experts take these precautionary measures, it should signal a warning to general users.</p>
      <h3>Thousands of exposed webcams</h3>
      <p>Another warning sign should be the number of webcams which are unsecured and accessible by any other user connected to the Internet.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wizcase.com/blog/webcam-security-research/"><b>Research published by security publication Wizcase</b></a> discovered 15,000 publicly-accessible webcams, some of which were located inside homes.</p>
      <p>Using the devices’ connections to the Internet, a white hat hacker was able to view live video, edit settings, and manipulate feeds.</p>
      <p>Wizcase listed how criminals can exploit these flaws in order to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>View people in their own houses and take pictures.</li>
        <li>Access and modify settings and admin credentials.</li>
        <li>Gain personal information, which hackers can use break into bank accounts and steal identities.</li>
        <li>Form a good picture of the layout of properties to plan break-ins.</li>
        <li>Manipulate or adjust feeds.</li>
        <li>Gain insights on the practices of business competitors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Furthermore, webcams exploits could potentially be used by governments to spy on the daily activities of citizens or to perform intergovernmental espionage.</p>
      <p>All these possibilities make a strong case for covering your webcam.</p>
      <h3>Why webcams are vulnerable</h3>
      <p>One reason why webcams are vulnerable to attack is due to the need for users or manufacturers to access them remotely via the Internet.</p>
      <p>A combination of network protocols known as UPnP then allows for access without high-level technical manual configurations.</p>
      <p>This simplifies the setup process for the end-user, but makes the webcam vulnerable if not protected by authentication measures.</p>
      <h3>Protecting your webcam</h3>
      <p>If you would like to ensure the security of your webcam, there are a number of measures you can take.</p>
      <p>It is best to first change the default username and password of your Internet-connected camera – after which you can follow the steps below to secure your network:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Whitelist specific IP and MAC addresses to give webcam access to only authorised devices.</li>
        <li>Check your webcam model and ensure that security updates are installed.</li>
        <li>Research and purchase webcams with built-in security.</li>
        <li>Disable UPnP on your web camera if you are using P2P.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can also use online scanning platforms like <a href="https://www.shodan.io/"><b>Shodan.io</b></a> to enter your external IP and check if your device has been exploited.</p>
      <p>For added peace of mind, you can cover your webcam with a piece of tape, an attachable shutter, or other material when not in use.</p>
