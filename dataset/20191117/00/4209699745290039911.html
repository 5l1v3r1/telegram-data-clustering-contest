      <p>Farooq Kperogi, a Nigerian professor based in the United States,<br/>claims he has received at least a threat from a member of President<br/>Muhammadu Buhari's family, Bello Inua Anka.<br/><br/>Kperogi said he was being threatened for posting on Twitter a birthday<br/>video of Mamman Daura, Buhari's nephew and chief of staff.<br/><br/>In a screenshot of the conversation, Kperogi pointed out that what<br/>happened between him and Anka, the sender threatened to sue the<br/>professor and critic of the Buhari regime if he failed to pull down<br/>the video.<br/><br/>"I promise you won't get away with this. You will hear from my lawyers<br/>as long as the video remains on your wall," the message said.<br/><br/>Kperogi, who was accused of sharing various unfounded pictures and<br/>videos during the 2019 elections, said he merely shared the video that<br/>was already in the public domain.<br/><br/>He said: "I didn’t shoot the video. It isn’t exclusive to me. In fact,<br/>it had already done the social media rounds before I shared it on my<br/>social media handles.<br/><br/>"The video was shot, edited, and shared by a member of the Buhari<br/>family. Why should I edit or take it down?"<br/><br/>Continuing, Kperogi stated, "Anyway, if his threat is limited to suing<br/>me in US courts where I live and work, I’m waiting for him. I’ve<br/>already notified my lawyers here. But there’s something darker and<br/>more sinister in the threat 'I promise you won’t get away with this'.<br/><br/>"I’ve received countless threats from supporters of Buhari’s fascist<br/>monocracy. Someone even called for my execution—along with Chidi<br/>Odinkalu and Ahmed Salkida— on Twitter last week.<br/><br/>"I dismissed it as the inconsequential overzealousness of a faceless<br/>Buhari Media Center (BMC) troll."<br/> </p>
