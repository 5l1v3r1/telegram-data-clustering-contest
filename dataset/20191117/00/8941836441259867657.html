      <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/saudi-arabia/">Saudi Arabia</a>’s state-owned oil giant <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aramco/">Aramco</a> announced Sunday it will sell a 1.5% stake in the company as it looks to raise as much as $25.6 billion from the sale.</p>
      <p>The newly released figures also revealed a valuation for the company that’s between $1.6 trillion and $1.7 trillion, a figure that fell short of the $2 trillion mark Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had sought.</p>
      <p>Still, a 1.5% flotation could raise between $24 billion and $25.6 billion to help fuel the Saudi economy. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/saudi-aramco/">Saudi Aramco</a> announced it will have 200 billion regular shares, selling 1.5% or what is 3 billion shares.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aramco/">Aramco</a> set a stock price range of 30 to 32 Saudi riyals, or $8 to $8.50 a share for investors.</p>
      <p>The company is selling 0.5% to individual investors, which will include Saudi citizens, residents of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/saudi-arabia/">Saudi Arabia</a> and Gulf Arab nationals, and 1% to institutional investors, which could include major Chinese and Russian buyers.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aramco/">Aramco</a> will announce the final price for the stock when the book-building period ends on Dec. 5. Trading on the local Tadawul exchange in Riyadh is expected to happen sometime in mid-December.</p>
      <p>The highly anticipated sale of a sliver of the company has been generating global buzz because it could clock in as the world’s biggest initial public offering, surpassing record holder <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alibaba/">Alibaba</a> whose IPO raised $21.8 billion on its first day of trading in 2014.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/saudi-aramco/">Saudi Aramco</a> is the kingdom’s oil and gas producer, pumping more than 10 million barrels of crude oil a day, or some 10% of global demand. The oil and gas company netted profits of $111 billion last year, more than Apple, Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil combined.</p>
      <p>The kingdom’s plan to sell part of the company is part of a wider economic overhaul aimed at raising new streams of revenue for the oil-dependent country, particularly as oil prices struggle to reach the $75 to $80 price range per barrel analysts say is needed to balance <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/saudi-arabia/">Saudi Arabia</a>’s budget. Brent crude is trading at just over $63 a barrel.</p>

        <p>Prince Mohammed has said listing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aramco/">Aramco</a> is one way for the kingdom to raise capital for the country’s sovereign wealth fund, which would then use that revenue to develop new cities and lucrative projects across <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/saudi-arabia/">Saudi Arabia</a>.</p>
        <p>Despite <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aramco/">Aramco</a>’s profitability, the state’s control of the company carries a number of risks for investors.</p>
        <p>Two key <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aramco/">Aramco</a> processing sites were targeted by rockets and missiles in September, an attack which claimed by Iran-Backed Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen but which <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/saudi-arabia/">Saudi Arabia</a> blamed on its regional foe Iran. The government also stipulates oil production levels, which directly impacts <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aramco/">Aramco</a>’s output.</p>
