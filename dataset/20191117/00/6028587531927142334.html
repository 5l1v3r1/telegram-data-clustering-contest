      <p>The much-anticipated third season of <i>The Crown </i>is available as of today to view on Netflix. Worry may have set in as Olivia Coleman takes over Claire Foy’s portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II—would the much-loved Oscar-winning actress be able to fill Claire Foy’s shoes, one of the reasons (the wonderful actress, not the shoes) that has made this regal series so successful and popular? Now that you are surely reassured and that you’ve almost finished watching the whole third season, here is a list of shows that will appease your thirst for sumptuous costumes and décor of a Royal family fictionalized history across Europe (and beyond). These may all be peppered with historical inaccuracies, and leave you wondering why monarchies still exist today, but are all very entertaining. What makes <i>The Crown </i>stand apart from all of these shows is of course that it follows the life of a living monarch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Victoria</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you want to continue within British royal history, then the ITV series, <i>Victoria</i>, is a good series to follow <i>The Crown</i>, as it focuses on Elizabeth II’s ancestor Queen Victoria. The series is now in its third season. Much like <i>The Crown</i>, <i>Victoria </i>begins with the circumstances that led to the young eighteen-year-old princess becoming queen in 1837. The show portrays Victoria’s troubled relationship with her mother, her close friendship with Lord Melbourne, and her courtship and marriage with Prince Albert. Victoria was the longest reigning monarch of the United Kingdom, before Elizabeth II surpassed her with 67 years of reign. The series is available on Amazon Prime. </p>
      <p>
        <b>The Tudors</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you want to stay within British royal history, Showtime’s <i>The Tudors </i>is a binge-worthy show. The four-seasons period series is set in sixteenth century England, during Henry VIII’s reign, the monarch most well-known for his serial marriages. The series recounts the King’s meeting with Anne Boleyn, which will lead to the English Reformation, separating the Church of England from the Catholic authority of the Pope. The series was criticized for its blatant historical inaccuracies, but was nonetheless a huge success, mainly due to its dramatized storyline and numerous sex scenes.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Versailles</b>
      </p>
      <p>For those who would like to know more about French royal history, <i>Versailles </i>tells the story of its most cherished monarch Louis XIV, nicknamed the Sun King. A Canal Plus co-production, with English-speaking actors, <i>Versailles </i>follows King Louis XIV overseeing the construction of his palace in Versailles, as he moved his court from Paris to Versailles. The series is similar in style as <i>The Tudors</i>. The show was filmed on location at the Chateau de Versailles and in Paris. This lavish series set in the Versailles court will have you hooked with its intrigues, explicit sex scenes, and sumptious wavy long hairdos.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Isabel</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Spanish series <i>Isabel </i>is about the life of Queen Isabelle I of Castile. The three seasons relate her ascension to the Spanish throne in the fifteenth century, until her death. A TVE production, <i>Isabel </i>was very popular in Spain, as the series narrates one of the most important moments in Spanish history. The success of the show is also due to the way it portrayed Isabel as a strong woman, prepared to fight for her convictions, from her arrival at her brother King Enrique’s court at a young age to her marriage with Fernando of Aragon, and becoming queen at 23 years old in the first season. The three seasons of <i>Isabel </i>was followed by another series, entitled <i>Carlos Rey Emperador</i>, which recounts the life of Isabel’s grandson, who became one of the most powerful monarchs in Europe. The two series led to a feature film, <i>La Corona Partida</i>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Magnificent Century</b>
      </p>
      <p>Turkish series, <i>Muhtesem Yuzyil </i>called <i>Magnificent Century </i>in English, is based on the life of the longest-reigning Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Ottoman Sultan Süleyman the Magnificent. This is an addictive soap series with cliffhangers at the end of each episode. The series is really about the Sultan’s wife Hürrem Sultan, kidnapped and brought to the Sultan’s harem, she becomes his favorite concubine, and then Sultana. The series shows Hürrem’s struggle to retain power and influence over the Sultan, in order to keep herself and her children safe. The show is particularly popular in the Balkans and Greece, although it was criticized by some for taking liberties with some of the historical facts depicted.</p>
