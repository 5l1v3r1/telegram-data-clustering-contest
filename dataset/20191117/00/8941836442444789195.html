      <p>HONG KONG (AP) - Bows and arrows, rocks, bricks, Molotov cocktails, blue dye fired from water cannons, and tear gas engulfing Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University were the defining images Sunday as anti-government protests entered their sixth month.</p>

      <p>Water cannon trucks drove over bricks and nails strewn by protesters and sprayed them at close range in a bid to drive away protesters on the streets outside Polytechnic.</p>
