      <h1>Arsenal consider giving former captain David O'Leary job as consultant</h1>
      <h2>Chairman Sir Chips Keswick is among the leading names at the Emirates Stadium who want to appoint the Irishman</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:05:09+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:05</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Members of Arsenal's hierarchy are considering former captain David O'Leary for a job as a club consultant.</p>
      <p>Chairman Sir Chips Keswick is among those at the North London club who want to appoint the Irishman, as reported by <i>Neil Moxley</i> in his column for <i>The People.</i></p>
      <p>O'Leary made a record 722 appearances for the Gunners during his 19 years at Highbury and has held an ambassadorial role since 2014.</p>
      <p>It is understood that Keswick, who has been the club's chairman since 2013 after initially joining the board of directors in 2005, wants O'Leary to assist with the club's recruitment, in particular.</p>
      <p>However, Arsenal's current head of football Raul Sanllehi - the man who would be most affected by his arrival - is <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-engulfed-bitter-spat-raul-20878224">understood to be against the move</a> .</p>

      <p>In addition to spending almost two decades with the Gunners as a player, O'Leary also has experience as a manager with the likes of Leeds United and Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>He enjoyed success with both clubs, helping to take Leeds to the semi-finals of the Champions League in the 2000-01 season before their defeat to Valencia.</p>
      <p>The Republic of Ireland international also helped Villa to finish sixth in the Premier League - one point outside a European spot - in his first full season with the Midlands club and with a limited budget.</p>

      <p>O'Leary, who helped <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> to two league titles and FA Cup triumphs as a player, has been spotted at many of the Gunners' matches this season.</p>
      <p>Despite currently sitting sixth in the table, Unai Emery's side have struggled to find consistency and are eight points adrift of the top four after a taking just two points in their last four league games.</p>
      <p>Following a 2-0 defeat to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City before the international break, Arsenal return to action next Saturday when they host a <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> side that is currently struggling in the relegation zone.</p>
