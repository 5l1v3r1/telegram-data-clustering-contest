      <h1>South Africa’s weapon technology stolen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>A major security breach at state-owned arms manufacturer Denel may have led to the theft of highly sensitive and classified weapons technology information.</p>
      <p>This is according to City Press, which reported that President Cyril Ramaphosa has authorised the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) to investigate the matter.</p>
      <p>The report stated that the intellectual property related to Denel’s missiles was stolen by current and former employees and given to arms company Saudi Arabian Military Industries (Sami).</p>
      <p>Many former Denel engineers with experience in designing and manufacturing missiles are now working at Sami.</p>
      <p>An army general told City Press that what happened at Denel is industrial espionage and amounts to treason.</p>
      <h3>Big problems at Denel</h3>
      <p>This report comes at a time when <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/business/311451-gupta-linked-state-capture-crushed-us-denel-ceo.html"><b>Denel finds itself in such financial trouble</b></a> that it is struggling to pay salaries and service its debt.</p>
      <p>The reason for the mess at the company, Denel CEO Daniel du Toit said, is the hangover of state capture and mismanagement.</p>
      <p>Du Toit said there is a direct link between state capture involving the Gupta family and the company’s financial predicament.</p>
      <p>State capture is, however, not the only reason. “We have to be objective in our assessment – there is also an element of mismanagement and poor efficiencies,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The effect of state capture is enormous on the organisation, which is broken and paralysed as a consequence of state capture,” he said.</p>
      <p>Du Toit said the Denel board and management are taking action with the support of their audit firms, with legal action against those implicated in corrupt dealings.</p>
      <p>He said they are trying to recover some of the money linked to state capture, but that it is not as significant as with some of the other state-owned enterprises.</p>
      <h3>Denel missiles</h3>
      <p>Denel has a wide variety of missiles, including air-to-air missiles, air-defence missiles and anti-armour missiles.</p>
      <p>The company’s flagship Umkhonto missile is an indigenous product, designed, developed and manufactured in South Africa.</p>
      <p>The Umkhonto missile design includes stealth (passive IR seeker and low smoke rocket motor) and flexibility (multi-target engagement and ability to launch from any position).</p>
      <p>The missile is high-velocity and infrared homing, providing all-round defence against simultaneous attacks from missiles and aircraft.</p>
      <p>Although it is a surface to air missile, it is also capable of taking out stationary surface targets.</p>
      <p>The Umkhonto was designed with a 23kg warhead for high-kill probability, unlike other SAM missile systems in its class.</p>
      <p>In September 2018 Denel Dynamics announced that it is expanding its missile portfolio with new weapons and was enhancing its existing missiles.</p>
      <p>The new missiles included the Cheetah air defence missile and P2 surface-to-air munition.</p>
      <p>This complemented Denel’s wide range of existing missiles, including the Umkhonto, Umbani, Mokopa and Ingwe missiles.</p>
