      <h1>Texas’ Disastrous Mistake Leads To Heartbreaking Loss vs. Iowa State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:15:26+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Losses don’t get much tougher than the one just suffered by Tom Herman and the Texas Longhorns, who fell on the road to Iowa State, 23-21, on a last-second field goal.</p>
      <p>Texas took the lead late and appeared to be in good position when a go-ahead field goal by Iowa State was missed with a little more than 2 minutes to go. The Longhorns were offsides on the missed kick, though, so the drive continued.</p>
      <p>Fast forward about two minutes and Iowa State was attempting a shorter game-winning field goal. This one did not miss.</p>
      <p>Iowa State wins.</p>

      <p>Texas fans were already frustrated with their team’s performance before the devastating mistake. The Longhorns’ fan base is surely furious now.</p>
      <p>Iowa State improved to 6-4 with the win, while Texas dropped to 6-4.</p>
      <p>The Longhorns entered the season with major expectations. They’ll need another win or two just to make a decent bowl game now.</p>
