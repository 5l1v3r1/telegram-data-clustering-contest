      <p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Buddy Hield scored a season-high 35 points, Richaun Holmes hit two free throws with 13.3 seconds remaining to give Sacramento the lead, and the Kings snapped the Boston Celtics’ 10-game winning streak with a 100-99 victory Sunday.</p>
      <p>Marcus Smart had a chance to win it for Boston, but his runner in the lane hung on the rim before trickling off as the buzzer sounded.</p>
      <p>Harrison Barnes added 13 points and Bogdan Bogdanovic had 12 points and 10 assists for the Kings (5-7), who lost a similarly close game two nights earlier to the Lakers in Los Angeles.</p>

        <p>TIP-INS</p>
        <p>Celtics: According to STATS, Boston was just the second team in NBA history to rattle off 10 wins in a row after losing its opener, joining the 1979-80 Milwaukee Bucks.</p>
        <p>Kings: Coach Luke Walton didn’t offer much reaction to the NBA announcing that a key foul on Barnes on Friday, which sent LeBron James to the line to sink two free throws that helped the Lakers pull out the win, should have been called an offensive foul on James. “I don’t care, I don’t look at it,” Walton said. “Our mindset is ‘What’s next? What are we doing next?’”</p>
