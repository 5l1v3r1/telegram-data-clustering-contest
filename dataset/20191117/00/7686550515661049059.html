      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/knife-crime-trauma-moss-side-17238648">Manchester Evening News,</a> 39-year-old Chinyere McKenzie left 'poshville' and has gone home to Moss Side, to help those affected by knife and gun crime.<br/><br/>This comes after she witnessed a brutal murder that made her want to improve the lives of Manchester's most vulnerable people.<br/><br/>Since then, Chinyere has created her own brand and social enterprise called 'Muma Knows Best' where people can talk through their traumas and get some support with anything they're going through.</p>

      <p>Before she was performing live on stage and living in London, Chinyere Mckenzie spent her youth living in Moss Side. <br/><br/>In 2004, she was chosen to be part of the pop group VS, alongside Marvin Humes (who later went on to be in the boy band, JLS); while they were only together for a year, they released a top 10 hit called 'Love you like mad'. Chinyere's appeared on Top of the Pops and has also performed to thousands of fans at the iconic Manchester Arena.<br/><br/>She also married ex-Manchester City footballer, Dickson Etuhu; the couple divorced after five years.<br/><br/>Speaking to Manchester Evening News, Chinyere said she returned home in 2018 as she "needed support from [her] close family and friends," after feeling "defeated" by the divorce.</p>
      <p>However, her arrival home changed her life in more ways than she expected.<br/><br/>She said: "As I arrived back, I saw a young boy in the street who was stabbed and killed.</p>
      <p>"I was shocked, and it instantly made me see that things had gone too far and things had to change."<br/><br/>She said going back to the community really opened her eyes; there was a lot of violence in her area while she was growing up and she realised that "parts of the community have still not been able to get over that era".<br/><br/>She continued: "people really needed to come together as a community and talk to one another if any change was going to happen”.</p>

      <p>Chinyere launched her own weekly radio show called 'Muma Knows Best', where people can ring in and talk about anything that has been troubling them.</p>
      <p>Chinyere said: "I feel that I’ve been in a great position being a pop star and being at a place where I was financially able and now I feel I am at a point where I am able to do what I want to do,</p>
      <p>“What I want to do is help bridge that gap that I see between the rich and poor and between opportunity and perception."<br/><br/>When asked about where the name came from and who 'Muma' represents, Chinyere had this to say: "Muma is not me, I am certainly not saying I know it all.</p>
      <p>"I'm the person going on the journey trying to find the answers to the questions.</p>
      <p>"Muma is the voices of everyone else that comes up with the answers and goes through those experiences."</p>
      <p>It's not just the listeners that can take something away from the radio show; Chinyere herself has grown and evolved since its creation.<br/><br/>She said: "I've learnt so much from my listeners, and what's beautiful is that I'm on a journey of self-discovery too.</p>
      <p>"Being able to reconnect with myself is important and I'm doing that on this journey with everyone else."</p>

      <p>Chinyere is currently fundraising, hoping to evolve her brand into an even bigger enterprise; she's hoping to help people on a bigger scale so that anyone affected by trauma or a troubling life event can bounce back.<br/><br/>She's also part of a ten part YouTube series documenting her journey. The 'Muma Knows Best' Youtube channel has been well-received, with some commenters remarking on how inspirational the series is them. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPsqzL9hBXE&amp;list=PLo0yrfA_CUTBvF7vnPzXe-eUN4Y7SLEx7">You can watch the first episode, here. </a><br/><br/>Talking about the YouTube series, she said: “If I open up, I hope it will have a knock-on effect on other people and encourage them to do the same.</p>
      <p>“Some people have real issues that are difficult to share but what I've discovered with the radio show and hopefully the documentary series is that they are willing to talk about it with me and the community we have built up.</p>
      <p>“It solidifies to me that what we’re doing is right and we need more support because there’s people out there that need the help and aren’t potentially getting it.</p>
      <p>"It’s not about fearing our differences, it’s about celebrating our differences and coming together to enrich those differences".</p>
