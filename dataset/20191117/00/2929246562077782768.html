      <p>Australia fast bowler James Pattinson will miss the first Test against Pakistan in Brisbane after Cricket Australia found him guilty of violating their Code of Conduct policy pertaining to 'personal abuse of a player'.</p>
      <p>As per a media release from Australia's governing body, Pattinson committed the offence – classified as a Level Two breach of the body's code, which can warrant two suspension points – during Victoria's Sheffield Shield match against Queensland, although the exact details of the violation were not revealed.</p>
      <p>Pattinson apologised for the act and accepted the penalty without contesting. "I made a mistake in the heat of the moment," Pattinson said. "Straight away I realised I was in the wrong, and I apologised immediately, both to the opponent and to the umpires.</p>

      <p>"I have done the wrong thing and accept the penalty. I’m gutted to miss a Test match, but the standards are there for a reason and the fault is mine."</p>
      <p>Pattinson has had a fair share of disciplinary troubles in recent times. In March this year, he was found guilty of two separate Level One offences, and now finds himself on thin ice. According to Australia's Code, four such offences in the span of 18 months can result in 12 suspension points, which means if Pattinson commits another breach in the next 10 months, he could be banned for either six Tests or 12 ODIs or a combination of both.</p>

      <p>"We have a duty to uphold the highest standards of behaviour and the action taken in this matter demonstrates that," said Sean Caroll, Cricket Australia’s Head of Integrity and Security. "On this occasion, James acknowledges he fell short of that expectation."</p>
      <p>Pattinson was considered to be in a two-way battle with Mitchell Starc for the third fast bowlers' spot for the first Test against Pakistan, alongside Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood. Australia have opted against calling for a replacement to the initial squad, which means Starc, who has been in red-hot form in the Sheffield Shield, is likely to play at The Gabba.</p>
