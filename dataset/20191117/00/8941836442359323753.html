      <p>WACO, Texas (AP) - Oklahoma quarterback <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jalen-hurts/">Jalen Hurts</a> was shouting at himself coming off the field after his third turnover, a fumble when running toward the end zone.</p>
      <p>When it was all over, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jalen-hurts/">Hurts</a> and coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lincoln-riley/">Lincoln Riley</a> were sharing a joyous embrace and the No. 10 Sooners’ playoff hopes were still alive.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gabe-brkic/">Gabe Brkic</a> kicked a 31-yard field goal with 1:45 left after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jalen-hurts/">Hurts</a> threw four touchdown passes for the Sooners, who overcame a 25-point deficit and the quarterback’s miscues in a 34-31 win over No. 12 Baylor on Saturday night that ended the Bears’ bid for an undefeated season.</p>

      <p>“I put us in a horrible situation and we found a way to come back,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jalen-hurts/">Hurts</a> said. “We overcame adversity, and you’re remembered for what you do in November. So it’s a big-time win today.”</p>
      <p>The Sooners (9-1, 6-1 Big 12, No. 10 CFP) made the big comeback without standout receiver CeeDee Lamb. The national leader with 13 touchdown catches didn’t play because of what <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lincoln-riley/">Riley</a> called only a “medical decision.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jalen-hurts/">Hurts</a> still completed 30-of-42 passes for 297 yards with three of his TDs to freshmen - two to Austin Stogner and the game-tying 2-yarder to Brayden Willis with 5:25 left. The quarterback also ran for 114 yards.</p>
      <p>Baylor (9-1, 6-1, No. 13 CFP) had its 11-game winning streak snapped and joined No. 7 Minnesota with their first losses Saturday. The only remaining undefeated FBS teams are No. 1 LSU, No. 2 Ohio State and No. 3 Clemson.</p>
      <p>“We told our guys it’s going to have to bother us, hurt us,” Baylor coach Matt Rhule said. “But hopefully we’ll come back next week rejuvenated, learn from it with a chance to play these guys again sometime down the road.”</p>
      <p>Oklahoma and Baylor could meet again in three weeks in the Big 12 championship game. The league’s top two teams play Dec. 7 in Arlington, Texas.</p>

        <p>Oklahoma erased a three-touchdown halftime deficit and tied the game at 31-all on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jalen-hurts/">Hurts</a>’ 2-yard TD pass to Willis. The Bears had run only seven plays for 35 yards in the second half until that point, and their only first down had been on a play when JaMycal Hasty fumbled, before punting again.</p>
        <p>“We were so amped to play this game, maybe too much honestly in the beginning,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lincoln-riley/">Riley</a> said.</p>
        <p>The Bears had one more chance after the go-ahead field goal. They got to the Sooners 40 before linebacker Nik Bonitto’s interception with 29 seconds left.</p>
        <p>Charlie Brewer, who finished 18-of-29 passing for 194 yards, threw two touchdown passes to Denzel Mims and ran for two more in the first half when the Bears jumped out to a 28-3 lead.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jalen-hurts/">Hurts</a> was running toward the end zone to get the Sooners within a touchdown in the third quarter when he fumbled - big defensive end James Lynch reached out and knocked the ball loose, then recovered it in the end zone.</p>
        <p>That was after the Sooners had opened the second half with Stogner’s second TD catch, a 3-yarder that made it 31-17. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jalen-hurts/">Hurts</a> bounced back from his fumble on the next drive, hitting Wease for a 19-yard touchdown.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lincoln-riley/">Riley</a> said he didn’t have to say a lot to his players at halftime.</p>
        <p>“We all felt like we had a chance,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lincoln-riley/">Riley</a> said. “Not one person on this sideline didn’t believe it. … You’ve still got to go make it happen.”</p>
        <p>Grayland Arnold returned an interception 71 yards to set up Brewer’s 9-yard TD to Mims that made it 28-3 with 11 minutes left in the first half. Brewer had a 4-yard TD run on the first play of the second quarter that set up when Blake Lynch tripped up <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jalen-hurts/">Hurts</a>, who fumbled when he reached down to try to stay on his feet.</p>
        <p>After <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gabe-brkic/">Brkic</a> kicked a 39-yard field goal on Oklahoma’s opening drive, Brewer had a 2-yard TD run and then lofted a perfectly thrown 30-yard touchdown pass that Mims caught crossing the goal line.</p>
        <p>“Give our kids credit, they made so many phenomenal plays,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lincoln-riley/">Riley</a> said. “It would have been easy to pack up the tent tonight.”</p>
        <p>THE TAKEAWAY</p>
        <p>Oklahoma: The Sooners keep winning games in November when it counts, and still have a chance to get in the playoff for the fourth time in five seasons. They have won 19 in a row in November since a loss to Baylor in 2014.</p>
        <p>Baylor: The Bears can still win a Big 12 title, but they pretty much have no chance to get in the playoff even if they win out. They were already ranked behind a pair of two-loss SEC teams in the College Football Playoff rankings before losing a game. … Baylor’s defense had allowed only 19 points a game, but couldn’t get off the field in the second half against the Sooners, who finished 14 below their scoring average</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p>Oklahoma will be home for the last time this season when the Sooners host TCU next Saturday.</p>
        <p>Baylor plays its home finale next Saturday, when No. 22 Texas travels about 100 miles north on Interstate 35 to play the Bears.</p>
