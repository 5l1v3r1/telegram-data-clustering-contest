      <h1>France's Le Maire favors car industry professional as next Renault CEO</h1>

      <p>PARIS (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday that the search for a new CEO for Renault (PA:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/renault">RENA</a>) was still on and that he favored selecting a professional from the automobile sector.</p>
      <p>"I can confirm the next CEO has not yet been chosen. The only indication I can give you is that I wish it is a professional of the car industry because amid the radical transformation of the sector, one needs professionals," Le Maire told BFM television.</p>
      <p>The French carmaker, chaired by Jean-Dominique Senard, a former executive at tire maker Michelin (PA:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/michelin">MICP</a>) who was parachuted in following the Carlos Ghosn scandal, is expected to choose a new CEO by the end of the year so that the group can try and fully refocus on its operations.</p>
      <p>The French state has a 15% stake in Renault.</p>
      <p>Renault's interim chief executive Clotilde Delbos has applied to take the job on a permanent basis, two sources familiar with the matter have said, as the carmaker edges toward a shortlist likely to also feature several external candidates.</p>
      <p>One of the sources had said that Patrick Koller, the Franco-German CEO of car parts maker Faurecia (PA:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/faurecia">EPED</a>) , and Luca de Meo, the Italian boss of Volkswagen-owned SEAT, also ticked many of the boxes for recruiters, including that they both spoke French.</p>
