      <p>Naija News Understands that the <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/16/why-inec-may-cancel-kogi-bayelsa-election-results-okoye/"><u><b>Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC</b></u></a> commenced the announcement of the results under tight security police armoured tanks and patrol vehicles deployed ‎around the INEC office and the collation centre in Lokoja.</p>
      <p>Prof James Apam, the Kogi State Resident Electoral Commissioner said earlier this morning that results from six local governments are already available for declaration.</p>
      <p>While observers, top INEC chiefs have taken their seat inside the Mahmood Yakubu Hall where the announcement is to take place, many journalists have been barred from entering the hall. INEC officials claim that the restriction of access to journalist is due to limitation of space in the hall.</p>
