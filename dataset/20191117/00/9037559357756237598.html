      </p>
      <p>The former Punjab chief minister said that no one can create a misunderstanding between the party and the government. He clarified his remarks on former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.</p>
      <p>"Whatever I said about Nawaz was for Imran Khan's own good," he said.</p>
      <p>Elahi said that he had contacted Maulana Fazlur Rehman to save the country from descending into political chaos.</p>
      <p>Elahi had said a few days ago during an interview that Prime Minister Imran Khan should let Nawaz fly out of the country since the former prime minister was gravely ill.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview on Geo TV, JUI-F chief Fazl had said that Elahi had agreed to his stance when the last time the two met.</p>
      <p>Elahi was part of the government's negotiating committee that held talks with Fazl when the JUI-F chief brought thousands of protesters to the H-9 venue in Islamabad and demanded Prime Minister Imran's resignation.</p>
      <p>Though Defence Minister Pervaiz Khattak was heading the committee, Elahi and his cousin, Chaudhry Shujaat held talks with the JUI-F chief during the protest to present the government's demands. </p>
