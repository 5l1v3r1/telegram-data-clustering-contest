      <p>The aforementioned source made the supposed request from Ronaldo their headline. "<b>CR7 wants Pogba</b>".</p>
      <p>"Cristiano has<b> expressed to the Juve board his enthusiasm for Paul Pogba's return</b>", they explain.</p>
      <p>Juventus continue working to<b> make the dream of Pogba returning come true.</b> They are trying to make a move so that he changes the Premier League for the Serie A.</p>
      <p>They know that <b>signing Pogba is going to be complicated</b>... At United, they aren't giving in. Solskjaer isn't thinking about letting him go.</p>
      <p>Pogba finds himself at a crossroads. <b>He hasn't played since 30th September 2019</b>, when United drew 1-1 with Arsenal. SoÂ far this season, Pogba has only played 6 matches or 540 minutes.</p>
