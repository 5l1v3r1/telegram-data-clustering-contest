      <h1>A Very Different Kind Of Wine Book Shows You The Real Wine Life</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Per and Britt Karlsson</a></address>
      <p>“Four Seasons in the Côte Chalonnaise” (Quatre saisons en Côte Chalonnaise) is not a wine book like most others. Many wine books tell you about appellations, grape varieties, wineries and lots of other facts. This one does not. (Well, it does, a little bit.) Instead, this book tries to give you a feeling for how life is in the wine region that is called Côte Chalonnaise.We are in the southern part of Burgundy, where they grow mainly Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. But we are far away from the famous appellations in the Côte d’Or, further north, where some of the world’s most famous vineyards, and most expensive wines, can be found.</p>
      <p>The Côte Chalonnaise is not famous. It is rural. And it is very much the French countryside.</p>
      <p>What this book tries to do is give you a feeling for how that life is, especially for those who are involved with wine or close to wine. And here, everyone is. It is a book about people and about daily life in a wine region. Winter, spring, summer, and harvest time. It is actually much more a book about the people than about the wines.</p>

      <p>It is a beautifully produced “picture book”, or if you prefer, a photography book. The photographer, the Englishman Jon Wyand, is a specialist in the narrow niche of wine photography. And in that narrow field he is specialised in photography from Burgundy. His photography appears in many of the world’s wine magazine and wine books. You have probably seen many of them even if you did not notice that he was the author of the pictures.</p>
      <p>There are also a few short texts about the appellations in this part of Burgundy, written by Emmanuel Mère. The texts are in French but it doesn’t really matter if you read French or not, what counts here is the photography. The book is published in France by Bamboo Edition.</p>
      <p>Take a look here:</p>
      <p>The subtitle of the book is “au hazard des rencontres”, which could perhaps best be translated as “the serendipity of meetings”. That is exactly what this book is about. The people that Jon has met over the many travels he has done in this region.</p>
      <p>This is well illustrated by the story behind the photograph that opens the book, a picture of a young couple embracing at a street wine tasting festival, a fortuitous street photograph. But when Jon Wyand turned around to ask them permission to use the photo they had disappeared. Gone. So, impossible to use the photograph. But chance had it differently. Next year, back at the same street festival, incredibly, Jon runs into the couple again and gets the chance to ask them permission. Which is enthusiastically given.</p>

      <p>It is a book that shows you the real picture of how life is in most wine regions. Far from the famous chateaux and prestigious vineyard and glitzy wine tastings. Here it is a life where you work hard, hope for a good harvest and enjoy life (mostly) as much as you can. The book is split up in the four seasons of the year but that doesn’t really matter although it gives you an added insight into what making wine entails. And you will get some unexpected insights, for example, that foot-treading is still very much alive.</p>
      <p>A wholly enjoyable book.</p>
      <p>I should also mention that a few years back, Jon Wyand made a similar book, called “Une année en Corton”, or A Year In Corton. Corton is one of the most famous villages in Burgundy. If the Corton book is filled with even more colorful photographs and beautiful bright landscapes, the Côte Chalonnaise book is much more low-key both in photography, atmosphere and landscape. But both are equally enjoyable for anyone who wants to go on a picture voyage to rural winemaking France.</p>
