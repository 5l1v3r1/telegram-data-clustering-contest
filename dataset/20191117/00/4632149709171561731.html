      <h1>‘The romantic idea of a marriage is only for Bollywood movies’</h1>

      <p><i>Ahead of her son Rohan Murty’s wedding, the author and philanthropist has some pearls of wisdom</i> <br/><br/>The event was the launch of the fourth instalment of Sudha Murty’s Unusual Tales series for children – The Daughter from a Wishing Tree – Unusual Tales, about women in mythology. But trust Murty, chairperson of the Infosys Foundation, best-selling author and wife of NR Narayana Murthy, to make it a platform to give away some life lessons on gender equality, marriage, women at work, men, devadasis, children, environment and public transport. <br/><br/>The book launch happened on November 14 in Bengaluru, just a day after the story broke that Murty and NR Narayana Murthy’s son, Rohan was getting married on December 2, to Aparna Krishnan, daughter of a banker and a Navy Commander. But the shaadiwala feeling is not one to stop the Murthys from doing what they do. Just a day before the big announcement, the father of the bridegroom was discussing with Lord John Browne, former group chief executive, BP, and visionary author of Make, Think, Imagine, how the march of social media, fake news, complex computer codes that decide everything from health to finances will affect our lives and if we should put the brakes on technological advances.</p>
      <p>In Indian mythology, several women have helped their husbands with their intellect, discussed strategies, stood by them men in times of trouble... Men must reciprocate this too</p>
      <p>Sudha Murty<br/><br/>And two days later, Murty was sitting in a book store talking to her fans – children and their families. As you listen to Murty talk, you feel you’re privy to the advice she may have given her children, Akshata and Rohan. “Murthy travels 200 days in a year,” says his wife. “The romantic idea of a marriage is only for Bollywood movies. This is real life. You must learn to deal with it. If you have to travel, you have to travel,” she says, with the same kind of left-brained analysis that she would use to write a computer program. <br/><br/>As the lone woman in her computer engineering class in college, Murty says that she is now happy to see girls equalling boys in engineering colleges. “I tell the girls, please take care of the boys. They are a minority,” she says, as the audience chuckle along. <br/><br/>In a stream of consciousness narrative mode and breathy delivery, Murty’s wisdom is on tap. “Both sons and daughters must be taught to share their responsibilities at home. All jobs are equal. Men and women must respect each other and share responsibilities. Just like women support their men when they’re building companies and careers, men must also support their women. In Indian mythology, and I have chosen some stories of such women in this book, there are instances of several women who have helped their husbands with their intellect, discussed strategies, stood by their men in times of trouble, invested their money and acted as catalysts to their husband’s careers. Men must reciprocate this too.” <br/><br/>The ultimate validation that Murty lives by the principles of gender equality came from Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, chairman and managing director of Biocon Limited, who was in discussion with Murty at the event. “Rohan has cooked for me when I visited him. He made pasta for me,” said Mazumdar-Shaw, reiterating the need for gender equality. <br/><br/>On many occasions Murty has said that she took her children along with her to the Foundation office to make them aware of people with fewer privileges than them. Murty, who along with her husband is known to lead a monastic life, says, “Children have to be brought up in the right environment. But with regard to their surroundings and the climate too. Writing for children is not easy. You have to keep it interesting and accessible to them. I don’t write with the intention of giving a message. It’s the story that is important. They will arrive at the message.” <br/><br/>While the talk is on environment, the pollution and how it’s affecting children in Delhi, Murty says she arrived early, a good hour before the event. “I took the Metro and reached quickly.”</p>
