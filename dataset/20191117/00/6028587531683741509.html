      <p>The accelerating convergence of operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) is making the business benefits of IT apparent. However, it's also opening previously isolated OT systems to the cybersecurity risks of the globally interconnected IT world. As I mentioned in an interview with <a href="https://techhq.com/2019/07/abb-on-how-it-ot-must-cooperate-for-secure-iiot/">Tech HQ</a>, "OT systems are not only business-critical, but they can also be nation-critical or life-and-death critical."Therefore, they must be protected with state-of-the-art cybersecurity expertise.</p>
      <p>OT is the backbone of refineries, power plants, electricity grids, telecoms, rail systems, water supply systems, manufacturing plants and more. Vital OT systems include typical industrial control, protection and automation systems that involve industrial equipment such as engines, sensors, valves and related software and networks, along with other systems such as building management systems, access control systems, CCTV systems and vital medical equipment.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Threats Are Real … And Growing</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/trisis-xenotime-us-electric-sector/">Triton/Trisis</a>: This malware intrusion in an oil and gas plant in Saudi Arabia that began when two malware files were copied into an OT system in the plant caused the plant to shut down, though the damage could have been much worse. Malware shutting down an OT system is only the second-worst thing that can happen in OT. The worst is for the malware to target the industrial control system (ICS) and the related safety instrumented systems, which can, for example, prevent the plant from safely shutting down and cause it to spin wildly out of control, costing not only money but lives. Many experts believe Triton/Trisis is capable of doing that. Ominously, the hacking group behind Trisis has <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/trisis-xenotime-us-electric-sector/">reportedly </a>expanded its targeting to electric utilities in the U.S. and other countries.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/">Attack on Ukraine power grid</a>: The first cyberattack to take down a national power grid left more than 230,000 people without heat and power in frigid winter temperatures and simultaneously froze the controls of operators who could bring the grid back to life. The control systems in Ukraine were supposedly secure since they were well segmented from the control center business networks with robust firewalls. No matter. Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Word, spearfishing hackers stole the credentials of workers logging remotely into the SCADA network that controlled the grid and gained control.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-the-key-lesson-maersk-learned-from-battling-the-notpetya-attack/">NotPetya</a>: This encrypting ransomware froze networks around the world, causing business losses estimated at over a billion dollars. One company alone — Moller-Maersk, the world’s largest container shipping firm — reported business losses of $300 million when NotPetya infected 50,000 endpoints and thousands of applications and servers across 600 sites in 130 countries.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/">WannaCry</a>: Entering through vulnerable, public-facing SMB ports in the U.K., WannaCry crippled the National Health Service’s systems, forcing the cancellation of life-saving surgeries and leaving ambulances unable to find people waiting for help.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What You Can Do About It</b>
      </p>
      <p>Those are the highly publicized attacks, but many OT companies know the dangers firsthand, even if they didn’t make headlines. Nearly 60% of organizations using industrial control systems have experienced a system breach in the last year, and 97% of those companies acknowledge security challenges specific to the convergence of OT and IT, according to <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/white-papers/WP-Independent-Study-Pinpoints-Significant-Scada-ICS-Cybersecurity-Risks.pdf">Forrester</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s time for leaders in OT and IT to band together, to help one another understand the growing OT security risks and take the strongest, most effective action against them.</p>
      <p>That is why twelve charter-member companies from a range of industries and areas of expertise have come together to create the <a href="https://otcsalliance.org/">Operational Technology Cyber Security Alliance</a> (OTCSA), a noncommercial industry organization dedicated to ensuring that OT environments, as well as the interfaces enabling OT/IT interconnectivity, are protected and secured by the Alliance members’ pooled cybersecurity skills. The OTCSA was originally convened by our company and became a stand-alone, independent organization immediately upon launch. The Alliance will actively promote collaboration among leading OT and IT companies and their resident experts with the goal of developing complete, optimized cybersecurity strategies, frameworks and techniques.</p>
      <p>Creating the OTCSA is just one critical step. The transnational and cross-business nature of this issue requires companies to take stronger, independent action to secure OT:</p>
      <p><b>Know your risk:</b> A security team cannot protect assets it cannot see, creating a critical security gap for many companies. The first step in improving OT security posture is to have an up-to-date inventory of devices and applications running on a network. This serves as a foundation for planning security architecture. It enables best practices to be deployed based on a company’s needs.</p>
      <p><b>Institute tamper-resistant protection:</b> To ensure that IoT applications and data are trustworthy, companies need to adopt an end-to-end approach that locks down devices and their applications, data, and communications and prevents unauthorized access. Such an approach can mitigate cyber breaches and reduce IP theft.</p>
      <p><b>Meet safety and compliance standards:</b> Numerous cybersecurity frameworks and standards exist for ensuring the safety and reliability of critical-infrastructure systems. Complying can confound the savviest cybersecurity teams. Each standard has different functional and security control requirements for systems, software and processes. The most important industrial compliance frameworks include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ISA99/IEC 62443-3-3 and 4-2</li>
        <li>NIST SP 800-53 R4 and R5</li>
        <li>NERC CIP 005-5 and 003-7</li>
        <li>U.S. NIST FIPS 140-2</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Control Access: </b>Secure authentication is critical. Many of the most damaging security breaches related to operational technology have been due to compromised user accounts and passwords exacerbated by users being provided with inappropriate levels of access. Devices, users and applications need to be authenticated before they can access OT network segments.</p>
      <p>It takes a global village to protect the globe’s essential OT assets. The time is now.</p>
