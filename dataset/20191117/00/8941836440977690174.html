      <h1>Same as it ever was: worker health benefit costs rise again</h1>

      <p>In the ever-shifting world of company-provided health insurance, here’s a constant: It keeps getting more expensive.</p>
      <p>Workers may learn that their doctor will no longer be covered or they might have to pay a higher deductible before most coverage begins. Meanwhile, the employer paying most of the insurance bill faces the same big concern every year: The cost will probably rise higher than wages and inflation.</p>
      <p>Employer-sponsored health insurance is the most common form of health coverage in the United States. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that it covers about 153 million people.</p>

      <p>Q: What do big employers think about the possibility of a “Medicare for All” plan replacing what they offer, as some Democratic presidential candidates have proposed? Do they like the idea that the government may relieve them of this huge expense?</p>
      <p>A: Employers want their employees to have access to the most efficient, high quality and affordable health care possible. Employers at this point view what they provide as being better quality.</p>
      <p>The biggest challenge (they) see with what’s being proposed now, nobody is talking about how you reform the delivery system to be more efficient. There’s 30% waste within the system. You can’t just expand access (to care) without addressing how care is being delivered.</p>
      <p>Q: There’s a wave of expensive specialty drugs being developed. Some cost a million dollars or more. Will employees have access to them?</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>A: I think employees will have access. Some companies will delay the first six months or so when a new therapy comes out before they cover it. Employers just want to make sure that they’re working … as advertised, and it gives their pharmacy benefit manger an opportunity to manage those therapies appropriately.</p>
        <p>No one’s really thinking of not covering these, but they’re very concerned about the price.</p>
        <p>Q: Employers are very interested in covering telemedicine to improve access to care, but employees often are slow to use the technology. Do workers or patients not trust it?</p>
        <p>A: It may be more of a matter of not being used to accessing health care in that way.</p>
        <p>Q: Companies are not raising deductibles as much as they have in the past, but they still want to cut costs. Where are they turning their attention?</p>
        <p>A: They realize that health care is complex, that employees don’t touch health care with a lot of frequency or most don’t. They’re bringing in more services to help employees navigate their benefits, navigate the delivery system, understand their treatment options.</p>
