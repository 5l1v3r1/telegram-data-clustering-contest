        <b>In the last of the Euro 2020 qualifier games, England came away victorious after beating Kosovo 0-4.</b>
      </p>
      <p>They have <b>already qualified for the Euro 2020</b> after their win over Montenegro on Thursday night, but <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/seleccion-inglaterra/">England</a> now end their qualifying campaign well after another win, full of goals, against <b>Kosovo,</b> securing them<b> a top 6 seeding for next year's competition.</b></p>
      <p>The game started and<b> Kosovo looked dangerous, </b>they gave all they could in the first thirty minutes and<b> put England under quite a bit of pressure</b>, they just could not finish off their chances. England got the scoring underway and the<b> first goal came in the 30th minute!</b></p>
      <p>On the half hour mark, England took the lead from an unlikely source<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/harry-winks-209890/">- Harry Winks</a>. A nice bit of play and link up well saw <b>Wink receive the ball in the box</b> and he beat the defenders to <b>slot the ball in the back of the net </b>and give England the lead. From this point on, <b>England looked the more confident</b> of the two sides and Kosovo seemed to lose some of their spark.</p>
      <p>The referee blew the whistle for half time and<b> Harry Winks' first England goal </b>was the difference between the two sides at the break. <b>Nobody had ever beaten Kosovo internationally in their home stadium</b>, but all that was about to change...</p>
      <p>After a few changes from either side and a lot of good play from Kosovo,<b> the goals started coming in.</b> The second, later on in the second half. </p>

      <p>The<b> 78th minute</b> saw none other than <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/h-kane-120815/">Harry Kane</a> double their lead. An assist from Sterling, as he passed the ball into the box, with dreadful defending from Aliti, who gave the ball away to Kane, and of course, <b>he was there to slam the ball home. </b>No player has scored in all of their qualifying matches, but Kane just did so. <b>12 goals in 8 qualifiers.</b></p>
      <p>Four minutes later England were at it again, thanks to<b> a beautiful strike from </b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/m-rashford-284437/">Marcus Rashford</a>. Another assist from Sterling into the box and with one touch, Rashford naturally and <b>calmly pùt the ball into the bottom corner </b>to make it 0-3.</p>
      <p>Just after the board came up announcing 2 minutes of added time, England decided <b>to show off </b>and get another goal.<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/m-mount-307334/"> Mason Mount</a> was the scorer this time and it was <b>his first goal for England at a senior level. </b></p>
      <p>Full time saw England <b>win another qualifying game. </b>England have now scored <b>at least 4 goals in all seven of their Euro 2020 qualifiers.</b> 37 goals in 8 games. The second half was the key and even though they looked shaky at times, they managed to g<b>o away confidently with the win.</b> Kosovo were good at times, but were not clinical enough when it game to finishing and that was<b> the difference between the two sides.</b></p>
