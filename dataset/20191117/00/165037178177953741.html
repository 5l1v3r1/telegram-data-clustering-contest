        <b>Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal as reigning champions Portugal secured their place at the Euro 2020 finals on Sunday with a 2-0 victory away to Luxembourg.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Bruno Fernandes struck the opening goal on 39 minutes</b> before <b>Ronaldo tapped in a scrappy second late on </b>to clinch second place in Group B behind winners Ukraine, who drew 2-2 in Serbia.</p>
      <p><b>Portugal became the 17th nation to qualify</b> for next year's multi-host tournament, which kicks off in Rome on June 12, joining the likes of world champions France, Spain, Italy and England.</p>
      <p>Fernando Santos' side knew they would book their place at Euro 2020 with a win or by matching Serbia's result from their game in Belgrade.</p>
      <p>But <b>Portugal were made to work hard on a heavy pitch</b> by a Luxembourg team ranked 96th in the world that notably held France to a 0-0 draw in 2018 World Cup qualifying.</p>
