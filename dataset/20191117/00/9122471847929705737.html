      <h1>Michigan Linebacker’s Harsh Message For Michigan State After Win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:03:01+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Michigan continued to roll today, as the Wolverines took down Michigan State with relative ease in Ann Arbor, winning 44-10.</p>
      <p>Jim Harbaugh and his team were extremely pumped with the win, as the postgame locker room celebration <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/michigan-wolverines/michigan-locker-room-celebration-revealed">video shows</a>.</p>
      <p>One Wolverines linebacker had his own message for the Spartans following the win, too.</p>
      <p>Michigan senior Josh Uche told Michigan State to “never” come back to Ann Arbor following the victory.</p>
      <p>“We kicked them out the building, they should never come back here,” he said on FOX.</p>

      <p>We respect the Wolverines’ senior linebacker for pulling a Scar, but like Simba, the Spartans are definitely going to come back.</p>
      <p>Michigan will take on Michigan State in East Lansing next season before the game returns to Ann Arbor in 2021.</p>
