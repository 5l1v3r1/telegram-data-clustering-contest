      <p>CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo. (AP) - The case of a Colorado rancher charged with beating his fiancee to death with a baseball bat is close to going to jurors.</p>
      <p>Closing arguments are expected Monday in the trial of 33-year-old Patrick Frazee. He’s charged with murder in the death of 29-year-old Kelsey Berreth, whose disappearance nearly a year ago drew national attention.</p>
      <p>Testimony wrapped up Friday with a jail inmate alleging that Frazee tried to get him to kill the lead witness in the case, a former Idaho nurse who was having an affair with Frazee. Krystal Lee said she cleaned up the crime scene and watched as Frazee burned a plastic tote that she believed contained Berreth’s body.</p>
