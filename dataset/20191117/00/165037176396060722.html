      <h1>Did Cristiano get his 99th goal?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.besoccer.com/writer/besoccer" target="_blank">BeSoccer</a></address>

        <b>Portugal beat Luxembourg 0-2 to book their place at Euro 2020, but we do not know who scored the second goal. Was it Cristiano Ronaldo's or Diogo Jota's?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the 86th minute, <b>Portugal sealed their victory over Luxembourg </b>and at the same time, their place at Euro 2020. The question is did <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/c-ronaldo-28185">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> or Diogo Jota score it? </p>
      <p>The Wolverhampton man beat Moris with a shot which the goalkeeper got a hand to. The ball trickled towards the goal and <b>then Ronaldo appeared to make sure </b>no Luxembourg player could clear it at the last minute. </p>
      <p>The doubt is over <b>whether the Juventus player touched the ball</b> once it was fully over the line or not. The ex-Real Madrid player celebrated the goal as if it were his. </p>

      <p>The UEFA graphics credited Cristiano with the goal although Spanish referee <b>Gil Manzano will have the final say</b> in his match report. </p>
      <p>If it goes down as a CR7 goal, <b>it will be his 99th for his country</b> in 153 appearances. </p>
