        <i>“It is likewise my advice that Governor Bello should be magnanimous in victory. He should take steps to heal the wounds and take steps to reconcile the state across party lines. Kogi belongs to us all and he must allow all, irrespective of ethnic, religious or other social diversities to coexist in harmony, tolerance and mutual exchange of ideas. We must make Kogi work for all.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“To all leaders and members of our party, supporters and other well wishers, I thank you for believing in our project and standing till the end. My fervent prayer is that God shall not abandon you at the point of need. Rest assured that I remain eternally grateful for what you have done for me.</i>
