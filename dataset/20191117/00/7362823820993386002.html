      <h1>Photographer hospitalized after taking brutal hit during Georgia-Auburn game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:51:10+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:51</time> by <a rel="author">Morgan Phillips</a></address>
      <p>A photographer was hospitalized Saturday after she was briefly knocked unconscious with a brutal accidental hit by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/georgia-bulldogs">Georgia Bulldogs</a> running back Brian Herrian during their game against <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/auburn-tigers">Auburn</a>.</p>
      <p>Georgia said in a statement that Chamberlain Smith, a photography intern for the university's Athletic Association, was taken to East Alabama Medical Center in nearby Opelika for treatment. It did not specify what her injury was.</p>
      <p>Smith was kneeling down to take a picture late in the second quarter when Herrien was forced out of bounds in front of her. She appeared to get hit in the head by Herrien's knee.</p>

      <p>The game was stopped for several minutes while Smith received treatment from medical personnel. The CBS broadcast showed Smith opening her eyes as she was placed on a stretcher and she appeared to be conscious as she was taken out of Jordan-Hare Stadium.</p>
      <p>Georgia, who is No. 4 in the College Football Playoff rankings, defeated Auburn 21-14 to clinch the SEC East title and keep their hopes of a national championship alive.</p>

      <p>Georgia coach Kirby Smart opened his postgame news conference by sending “thoughts and prayers” to Smith.</p>
      <p>“It was really a scary moment,” Smart said. “Brian felt very sick about it. It was a tough deal, but hopefully she’s going to be OK. I think she is.”</p>
