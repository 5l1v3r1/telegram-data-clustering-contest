      <p>Hearts of Oak</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hearts of Oak were left frustrated after being held to a 1-1 draw by Wa All Stars in a friendly match played on Sunday at the Accra Sports Stadium.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Phobians, who celebrated their 108th anniversary last Monday, could not put smiles of the faces supporters as they failed to beat the former league champions.</p>
      <p>Wa All Stars, who had former Ghana goalkeeper Fatau Dauda, drew first blood on the stroke of halftime when Gerald Arkson curled in an effort from the edge of the box.</p>
      <p>Hearts of Oak had to wait until the 77th minute to find the equaliser. Obeng Jr found the net with a fine header.</p>
      <p>Hearts would have snatched the winner late on had not been for the experience of Fatau Dauda to keep the scoreline level.</p>
