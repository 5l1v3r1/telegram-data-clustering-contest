      <p>The Washington Wizards seemingly have a knack for making the most out of young centers the Los Angeles Lakers don’t want. Before last season, the Wizards claimed 21-year-old Thomas Bryant off waivers from the Lakers and watched with glee as he averaged 10.5 points and 6.3 rebounds while hitting a league-best 68.5 percent of two-point shots over 72 games.</p>
      <p>This past offseason, Washington helped facilitated the Anthony-Davis-to-the-Lakers trade between LA and the New Orleans Pelicans. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/parkercotton/2019/06/27/as-lakers-clear-cap-space-wizards-receive-wagner-bonga-jones-in-trade/#5e9a95da3b5f">Washington’s main prize in the deal</a> came in the form of 22-year-old Moritz Wagner, the 6-foot-11 center who played in just 43 games for LA last year. </p>
      <p>Wagner never managed to crack the Lakers’ rotation, averaging just 10.4 minutes per game. In just 10 games with the Wizards, though, Wagner has emerged as a vital role player. The Wizards entered Sunday just 3-7 and in 14th place in the Eastern Conference, but Wagner’s presence has been felt nonetheless.</p>
      <p>None more so than Friday against Minnesota when Wagner tallied career-highs of 30 points, 15 rebounds and four 3-pointers in Washington’s 137-116 road win. He became the first bench player in NBA history to reach those figures. </p>
      <p>During the best game of his career, he showcased the entire range of his skill set. He hit from the outside, he finished at the rim, he ran the floor and was dangerous in pick-and-rolls.</p>
      <p>Serving as a backup to Bryant, whom the Wizards re-signed this offseason to a three-year, $25 million deal, Wagner has positioned himself as one of the league’s most effective centers off the bench so far this season.</p>
      <p>Among backup centers who have played at least 100 minutes entering Sunday, Wagner is second in points, sixth in field goal percentage, fifth in free throw percentage and ninth in rebounds–all while averaging less than 19 minutes per game.</p>
      <p>Of that same group, Wagner does have two clear problematic areas—he has the most turnovers (24) and the second-most fouls (41). </p>
      <p>Regarding the turnovers, Wagner’s lanky frame largely prevents him from being much of a creator, which is partially why 75 percent of his field goal attempts come without any dribbles beforehand. </p>
      <p>The fouls aside, Wagner has still posted a defensive rating of 97.2, among the league’s leaders. </p>

      <p>Further, Wagner also leads all NBA players with 10 charges drawn this season. For perspective, that total is more than 13 teams have total. Wagner drew three charges just against the Timberwolves last week. </p>
      <p>Bryant is still a member of Washington’s most productive and most used five-man lineups, but it’s reassuring for the Wizards to know that they experience no significant drop off at the center position when Wagner enters the game. </p>
      <p>In fact, given Wagner’s defensive rating and his offensive rating (113.2), he has actually been more effective individually than Bryant so far this season (offensive rating of 109.0; defensive rating of 122.7). </p>
      <p>Wagner has his problem areas, but most 22-year-olds do.</p>
      <p>He is under contract through 2021-22, with a team option for that final season, and never for more than $3.8 million. </p>
      <p>Discarded by the Lakers in favor of a more veteran and proven commodity, Wagner is exactly the kind of asset the Wizards desire: cheap, young, controllable and with something to prove. </p>
      <p>At the risk of overreacting to a 10-game sample size, he has at least shown promise of a budding NBA center with mostly sound defensive instincts and admirable floor-stretching abilities. </p>
      <p>The Wizards are not competing this season, but Wagner is quickly becoming a building block for the years to come. </p>
