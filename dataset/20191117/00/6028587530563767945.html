      <p>If you watched UFC Fight Night 164 and were looking for an epic KO, you were mostly disappointed. There were only a few stoppages on Saturday night’s card, and both the co-main event and main event matches were forgettable.While that’s what happened in Sao Paulo, fans of MTK MMA saw what has to be the KO of the Year in London.</p>
      <p>Former UFC fighter Ross Pearson was the unfortunate recipient of one of the nastiest KOs you’ll ever see. Davy Gallon’s Rolling Thunder kick knocked Pearson out cold, and it is my KO of the Year in 2019 with a little over a month remaining.</p>
      <p>I hope Pearson is OK because this was a scary ending. That can be lost in the spectacular move Gallon pulled off to get the win. This one would have been good enough to win a Performance of the Night bonus on any UFC card. i’m not sure if MTK MMA gives out similar bonuses. If so, you can bet Gallon fattened his wallet with that honor.</p>
      <p>Gallon isn’t exactly an up-and-comer who will be on the UFC or another major promotion’s radar. The 30-year-old is 18-7 in his career, though Saturday’s victory started a two-fight win streak. The KO was just the fourth finish via strikes in Gallon’s career. To put it plainly, he’s not an elite fighter. However, he did do something otherworldly during a professional mixed martial artist bout, and that is worthy of respect.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Pearson should strongly consider making this his last fight. He’s lost three straight and the defeats are seemingly getting more brutal. At 35, he’s now 20-17 in his career and this is the third time he’s been viciously knocked out in the past two years. This most recent defeat is the kind that can change your life, let alone your career.</p>
