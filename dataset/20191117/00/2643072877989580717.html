      <p>Former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, has lamented the outcome of the Kogi and Bayelsa State Governorship election.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that both elections which held on Saturday recorded violence and ballot snatching.</p>
      <p>Recall that the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/17/kogi-election-inec-declares-30-staff-missing-full-list/"><u><b>Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC</b></u></a>), had declared 30 of its staff missing in the ongoing Kogi Election.</p>
      <p>The INEC ad-hoc staff took part in Saturday’s governorship election in Kogi state, north-central Nigeria.</p>
      <p>This online news platform understands that the INEC staff were posted to Olamaboro Local Government Area (LGA) by the commission and were declared missing around 1 a.m. on Sunday during the final collation of results in the local government.</p>
      <p>According to the commission, the missing INEC staff include Presiding Officers (POs) and Assistant Presiding Officers (APOs) of polling units in Imane ward 1 and 2 of Olamaboro LGA of Kogi State.</p>
      <p>Also, Senator Dino Melaye announced the death of his nephew, Olorunjuwon, who was shot by unknown gunmen at his polling unit during the Saturday’s election.</p>
      <p>Reacting in a post on his Twitter page, Fayose described the elections as a dark one for Nigeria and democracy.</p>
      <p>The former governor said the graveyard silence of Nigerians should not be mistaken for consent of these shenanigans.</p>
      <p>Fayose wrote: <i>“Today is another sad and dark moment for our country and democracy going by the outcome of Kogi and Bayelsa election brazenly rigged in connivance with INEC and security agencies.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“The graveyard silence of Nigerians should however not be mistaken for consent of these shenanigan, be warned!”</i>
