      <p>The Department of Immigration is now able to access real-time information shared by more than 190 member countries as the I-247 INTERPOL Information System is now live.</p>
      <p>Police Commissioner Sitiveni Qiliho says immigration officials now have direct access to the INTERPOL Information System for officers to conduct real-time search/check, sharing of information on crimes and criminals, names, fingerprints to stolen passports.</p>
      <p>Qiliho says the I-247 database will help the information and intelligence gathering efforts in regards to the threats of terrorism, in securing the borders especially since Fiji's reputation as an ideal location for hosting global meetings continues to grow, and is another avenue of ensuring the safety of global leaders that come to our country.</p>
      <p>Qiliho says that when a person enters the country, details can be entered into the INTERPOL Information System and officials will know who is wanted by INTERPOL through the records shared by 194 member countries.</p>
      <p>Qiliho says sharing information is vital, and INTERPOL has for decades assisted the Fiji Police Force in tackling transnational crime.</p>
      <p>Qiliho adds that Fiji will also be able to help neighboring island nations being the first to have the system.Â </p>
      <p>He says Fiji Police has had access to the I-247 system since 2004 and a request made to Government by him to extend the database system to the Department of Immigration was approved with funding and facilitated this year.</p>
