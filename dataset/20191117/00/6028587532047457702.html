      <h1>The World’s First Vagina Museum Just Opened In London</h1>

      <p>This weekend saw the opening of the world’s first bricks and mortar vagina museum in London, after a crowdfunding campaign raised almost £50,000 ($65,000) from supporters across the globe. <a href="https://www.vaginamuseum.co.uk/pages/information">The Vagina Museum</a> aims to educate, inform people about gynecological anatomy, and provide a space in which to hear about and discuss the taboo subjects surrounding female bodies.</p>

      <p>The tiny premises in London’s famous Camden’s Stables Market look, from the outside, like any other trendy store or cafe. The only giveaway is the discreet black and white sign above the black stable door. Inside the space is half given over to the gift shop and half for the exhibition space. There are the usual books, gift cards, stickers and badges, as well as a small but intriguing selection of vagina-themed jewelry. You can even buy a guitar plectrum with the museum logo alongside an abstract depiction of female genitalia shaped like a peony.</p>
      <p>The project was launched in March 2017, with founder and director Florence Schechter running one-off events and exhibitions around the country. Two and a half years, and over 1,000 donations later, she has her first physical premises.</p>
      <p>“Doing the pop-ups for the past few years has shown me that people are desperate to engage with the issues, as this is something they care about but can struggle to find safe and inclusive places to have these conversations,” she said. </p>
      <p>A 2016 <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/health/all">survey</a> revealed that 65% of women aged 16 to 25 felt too embarrassed to use the word “vagina” or “vulva”. They also lacked basic anatomical knowledge, and less than a quarter said they felt well-informed about gynecological health issues. Another <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/health/articles-reports/2019/03/08/half-brits-dont-know-where-vagina-and-its-not-just">poll</a> found that over half of the British public cannot correctly label all the parts of the female genitals on a diagram.</p>
      <p>“It is so important for individuals to be able to openly discuss their anatomy and feel there is no stigma or shame associated with it,” said museum curator Sarah Creed. “My hope is that this marks the start of a change of mindset and gets those conversations started.”</p>

      <p>As she shows us round the museum’s first temporary exhibition, entitled  “Muff Busters: Vagina Myths and How to Fight Them,” Creed explains that, while education was at the heart of their mission, they needed to find ways to ensure a steady stream of visitors. This not only explains the earrings shaped like a crocheted vulva, it justifies the bold name. The museum hopes to be about a lot more than pure anatomy, aiming to cover sex, sexuality, gender identity as well as sexual and reproductive health. But calling it the “gynecological museum” would have sounded too serious and medical, Creed explains. Instead, she says, they “wanted to engage with people through terminology they know.”</p>
      <p>Furthermore, they wanted to stigmatize the word itself, which often gets ditched in favor of euphemisms, or else referred to obliquely using the umbrella term of “female genitals” which is not only vague and uninformative, it fails to include trans, non-binary and intersex people. “Saying ‘vagina’ should be like saying ‘nose’ or ‘eyes’ or ‘mouth,’” says Creed. “It’s just another part of the body.”</p>
      <p>The Vagina Museum’s first temporary exhibition opened to the public on Saturday 16th November 2019, but the venue has been hosting events throughout October as part of their soft launch. The museum, which is a registered charity in the UK, is free to enter, and it open seven days a week. Alongside regular tours, it will host comedy nights, genital-themed bingo and pub quizzes, talks, and performances.</p>
      <p>As we walk around the exhibition, people pause to take selfies in front of a large sculpture of a tampon, coated in red glitter. Nobody here is remotely fazed. But as a group of journalists who write regularly about sex and gender, we are perhaps an easy audience. How the museum will go about drawing in the people it hopes to educate will be a different challenge.</p>
      <p>The premises recently acquired a license to serve alcohol in the evenings, which local residents have expressed concern over. They fear the museum will attract bachelor and bachelorette parties who will come to the museum as a joke and bring noise and disruption to the area. But these are exactly the kinds of groups the museum wants to reach.</p>
      <p>“We get lots of people coming to our quiz nights, and at first they’re all giggly about it but by the end they’re saying ‘wow, I actually didn’t know that!’” says Creed.</p>
      <p>There is already an online vagina museum, based in Austria. Meanwhile, Iceland is home to The Phallological Museum, which boasts a collection of more than 215 penises and penile parts, belonging to different land and sea mammals.</p>
