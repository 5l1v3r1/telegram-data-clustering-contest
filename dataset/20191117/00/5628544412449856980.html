      <h1>The Best Screenplays of the Year So Far</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.awardsdaily.com/author/admin/" target="_blank">Sasha Stone</a></address>
      <p>The trend lately has been for directors to either write or co-write their own screenplays. The idea is to have full control over the project, or the complete voice. But the truth of it is, in my opinion anyway, the best screenplays are actual screenplays, written by writers, not directors. Of course, there are obviously people who can do both extremely well – but they are rare. Most of the time, they one strength or another and it’s not really all that necessary for them to do both to make the best films of all time. Sure, a co-writing credit is always a good thing, especially if a director tinkers and adjusts and rewrites as they go along, but the truth is, you can’t make a good movie out of a bad script, or so George Clooney once said in Ann Hornaday’s fantastic must-read book, Talking Pictures: How to Watch Movies. Read that book. It is essential.</p>
      <p>The idea that a director MUST ALWAYS write their own work has, I think, done a little bit of stifling in the Oscar race, the reason being, Best Screenplay – adapted or original – is tied to Best Picture even more than director. So, as I’ve pointed out in the past, voters will often simply give the award for Best Screenplay and not director because they can spread the wealth better in the era of the expanded ballot, as in:</p>
      <p>The Artist wins Picture and Director but screenplay goes to Woody Allen for Midnight in Paris<br/>12 Years a Slave – McQueen as co-writer, where Alfonso Cuaron wins Director<br/>Spotlight – Tom McCarthy wins as co-writer, where Alejandro G. Inarritu wins Director<br/>Moonlight – Barry Jenkins wins as co-writer, where Damien Chazelle wins as Director<br/>The Shape of Water wins Picture, Director – but not original screenplay, which goes to Jordan Peele for Get Out<br/>Green Book – Peter Farrelly wins as co-writer, where Alfonso Cuaron once again wins as Director</p>
      <p>Only one auteur has won both since they expanded the ballot – Alejandro G. Inarritu who won as co-writer, and director and picture – so it happens but it’s rare. The films that have won Best Picture where there was a different writer than the director tend to more easily win all three, like The Hurt Locker, The King’s Speech, and Argo had Ben Affleck been nominated.</p>
      <p>In my opinion, the best screenplays are not those written by their directors. While a singular vision can sometimes be interesting as a fully immersive experience, and those can stand out, as a rule, your better off with a mix of voices on your film. For instance, Joel and Ethan Coen have made great movies throughout their careers that they wrote and directed but No Country for Old Men, which is one their very best and for which they won Best Picture, was a very faithful adaptation of a Cormac McCarthy novel. Adaptations by directors can be good too, obviously.</p>
      <p>Here are my personal choices for the Best Scripts of the Year so far, knowing that there are more to come – like 1917, which is co-written by the director, Sam Mendes, and Richard Jewell, which is not.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Best Scripts Not Written by the Directors</b>
      </p>
      <p>The two best stand-alone screenplays of films this year that weren’t written by their directors have to start with Ford v Ferrari and Dolemite is My Name. The best scripts, in my opinion, that were written or co-written by their directors are Parasite and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.</p>
      <p>These films take care to pay attention to each of the characters in the story. They are distinct from one another, and each has their own trajectory of successes and disappointments. It is all there on the page.</p>
      <p><b>Ford v Ferrari</b> written by Jason Keller, Jez and John-Henry Butterworth. This is a film about the conflict between the love of the sport and the corporate control over that sport. That’s the driving theme behind it and though it is specific to car racing it can easily be applied to anything, art, fiction writing. There are so many beautiful moments where the writing shines through – with the help, it must be said, of an intelligent director who gets the beats throughout and actors who are sensitive to notice those beats. It takes a village, truly, but it starts with the script. The moment when we are taken inside the head of Matt Damon’s Carrol Shelby as he tries to explain what it’s like to be on the road, alone, driving a really fast car. With great dialogue throughout specifically written for each of the distinct characters, the story moves fast at times, but never rushes through the character driven scenes, like Ken Miles looking at the race car map his son drew. Like the glorious scene in the car when Matt Damon takes Tracy Letts for a ride and the scene goes from comical to sentimental in about five minutes. Yes, that’s great acting, no doubt, but it’s on the page too. The writers let us in to each of the characters at a given point in time, because we have to know where they’re coming from or else nothing works. Is it perfect? No, but few things are and no script this year is. But whatever weaknesses the script has (like maybe Josh Lucas is a little too mean?) it’s made up for with the directing. That is why these two forces can often make the best movies because they bring so much to the film – not just the mind of one person. There isn’t a weak link in this film – from the top to the bottom and it’s easily one of the best films of the year, certainly the most exciting and I dare say, among the best writing. None of these three writers has ever written a script this good.</p>
      <p><b>Dolemite is My Name </b>– written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. When people talk about this movie they always talk about how funny it is. And it is funny. But it’s deeper than that, and to see that you have to listen to the writing, and of course, as with Ford v Ferrari, the directing and acting support the themes, the dialogue and the movement of the piece. Like Eddie Murphy’s Rudy Ray Moore spending time watching a movie made for white audiences, and looking up at the streaming light coming from the projector. He wants to be in that light. We see it, we hear it, we know it. We know why.The film has one of the rare friendships between a man and a woman that has nothing to do with the transactional relationships we often see where sex is involved. Here, Lady Reed — the brilliant Da’Vine Joy Randolph, becomes Moore’s support net and in turn, he supports her. But they don’t just put her in the movie as a kind of symbol and leave her there – no, good writing means they go deeper into her character than they needed to. What do we know about her? She can’t pay the bills. She’s a single mother. She has a history of shit men. She is happy to finally get work and she becomes Moore’s closest friend. One of the very best scenes in the film, among many, is when she tells him how grateful she is that he put her up on the screen because she didn’t women like her up there. In that light. The light continues as a theme throughout the movie, which is deceptively slapstick. What do we know about Rudy Ray Moore? A lot. We know where he came from, we know how he came about his act, we know what he wants and we know what he does with it once he gets what he wants. This is a carefully written, very exacting script that never gives any character the short shrift. Sometimes it’s just about being funny but other times, we have to go deeper to understand why this story is being told at all. Why, because it is the rare rags to riches story in the history of Hollywood where a black entrepreneur not only makes a movie for $100K and flips it to $12 million, but who inadvertently invented rap. He’s a big deal, Rudy Ray Moore, for his schlocky and hilarious endeavors. If you didn’t see what I see, watch it again. And listen.</p>
      <p><b>The Irishman</b> – leave it to one of the best screenwriters, Steven Zaillian, to give the adaptation of the book, “I Heard you Paint Houses” to life. The film isn’t exactly a true story, or one that can be proved – that Frank Sheeran killed Jimmy Hoffa – but it doesn’t matter and it has no impact on the worth of the film or the script. Zaillian is handling many different threads at once, from the legacy of Martin Scorsese and his relationship to mob movies, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, along with the story of Jimmy Hoffa’s rise, and how we watch these men age, and as it happens, de-age. We’re looking over the span of a lifetime for many of these characters and the actors who play them. It is as great a script as ever could be written about this story and the perfect example of why having a different writer than the director often reaps such successful results.</p>
      <p><b>The Two Popes</b> – Anthony McCarten’s fictional rumination on the transition of one pope to the next. This is a story of an imaginary friendship that has one foot in reality. This is a film about two things. Atonement for the past and the plea for the future. Of course, only a great writer working with great actors at the hands of a very good director can pull off the unbearable lightness of this story and make it at once so entertaining and meaningful. It’s an easy call to name this as one of the year’s best examples of great writing that stands on its own.</p>
      <p><b>Queen and Slim</b> by Lena Waithe – this a team of badasses who made a movie. A badass writer, a badass director and a badass female lead. Probably there isn’t a better female character than this one, perhaps because she was written by not just any female but one who, like the director, is not here to smooth out the rough edges but rather to sharpen them. The main character as played by Jodie Turner-Smith is complicated. How rare to have such a complicated female of color leading a film when so much of the time there is pressure to portray all women, but women of color especially, in a positive way. It isn’t that she isn’t portrayed in a positive way but she has flaws. She is impetuous, she has a trigger temper and she is not comfortable being around people. She’s a high achieving woman who is a warrior ready for the fight that comes with simply being a black female in America. What a great character in a great story. I love the energy of this film. I love the writing especially – and how distinct each of the characters were throughout.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Best Scripts Written or Co-Written by their Directors</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Parasite</b> – written by Bong Joon-Ho and Jin Won Han – this film starts with the writing, obviously, because it is so well constructed as a story and it would have to be because director Bong Joon-Ho needed to know exactly where it was going. Like the house the film surrounds, the story is multi-tiered. It starts out in one place, then takes you to a different level, and then another level and finally right down to the underneath. The house itself is constructed like the writing because there are areas that he has designated to reveal secrets. Like under the teenage daughter’s bed, like the backyard teepee the son builds, like the basement, like underneath the coffee table, like the inside of the car. Each of these different partitions enables the imposter family to fool the residents. Parasite is so funny until it isn’t. Bong Joon-Ho works with symbols and references that keep diving you back into the story, like the stone the imposter son carries around with him that promises wealth. Like the smell of poverty. Like rain. Like urine pouring down like rain. It is such vivid storytelling both in what the characters say and don’t say, leading up to an ending that is so beautifully moving its unforgettable. Is it even happening? Is it fantasy? What a story. And all of this before we even get to capitalism and class inequality.</p>
      <p><b>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</b> – by Quentin Tarantino. While it could easily be written off as a pop culture appreciation, this is a film that is the last installment of a revenge trilogy that started with Inglourious Basterds, and then continued with Django Unchained and now finishes off with another – a film that resides in the realm of magical realism where not only isn’t the story meant to be true, none of it is, but it has shades in truth. Tarantino is great at exposing what so many of us think and feel but rarely say. He has never been as clear and as brilliant as he is here, with this story, and for a guy who has won Original Screenplay twice that’s saying a lot. It is perhaps surprising that his most effective scenes are those that have no dialogue at all but just follow Sharon Tate around as she barrels towards who would otherwise be her gruesome demise. In those scenes, Tarantino shows his love for her and explains to us why this ending at all. Hats off to Tarantino for such a dazzling career, such an inventive mind and such a gift with storytelling.</p>
      <p><b>Jojo Rabbit</b> – written by Taika Waititi – you’d probably have to be a holocaust obsessive to really get Jojo Rabbit. I mean, REALLY GET IT. Throwaway lines about appeasement and how Waititi as Hitler slips in and out of how people always described Hitler. Half the time, he was jovial and even humorous and is often seen this way in the home movies with he and Ava Braun. And the other half of the time he’s Der Fuhrer giving his angry speeches at podiums, terrifying the world. But Jojo Rabbit wouldn’t be the great film it is if it only got Hitler right. What drives this film is the battle between good and evil that rages in the heart of a 10 year-old boy. Waititi is very specific in how he writes the female characters in this film and even gives them a scene together, which ends up being one of the best scenes in the movie where they are talking about what they would do when the war ends. It’s such a lovely scene because we don’t yet know the fate of either of them. One could die, one could survive, both could die. It is reminiscent of the bright spirit that was Anne Frank who kept being a teenager even while hiding in an attic to escape the nazis. How do we live with this even now? Well, this is a film that steers the ship in the right direction. We blast Bowie and we dance … because, at least for now, we are free.</p>
      <p><b>Waves</b> – Trey Edward Shults’ Waves is a highly structured film that is heavy on editing and directing. But it wouldn’t be what it is without starting with a great script. It is divided into two parts and both are like waves themselves – one comes fast and destroys everything, one gently laps the shore. It’s darkness and light, it’s hopelessness and hope. To get to the second part, you have to get through the first part and it isn’t easy. Shults has constructed something that is meant to remind us of how quickly things can go wrong in the life of young man who is moving too fast, being pushed too hard and can’t control his impulses. The second part of the film is how to live in the aftermath of the crash. Waves is one of the most powerfully told stories of the year and that started with the writing.</p>
      <p><b>Marriage Story</b> – Noah Baumbauch, like Woody Allen, very much writes in his signature style in all of his films. You know you are stepping into that world and you recognize the language of the storytelling. The extreme emotional reactions, the glib outsiders, the angst, and the women who light up the room. Though advertised as a film that tells two sides of a story, this film, to me, told one side of the story – his side. We don’t know what her side of the story would really be because it’s still him telling her side of the story. That’s why the Adam Driver side comes through so vividly. It is exciting to watch a Baumbach film because you never know what is coming next. He is more concerned with the characters and their motivations than with plot but Marriage Story seems to be more plot-heavy than most of his films. It is, perhaps more than any other movie this year, a film people connect with emotionally. There is no way that happens without great writing. Each character is distinct from the other and stays with you long after you seen the movie.</p>
      <p><b>Joker</b> – written by Todd Phillips and Scott Silver – Phillips had an idea of the kind of film he wanted to make – one that was a superhero movie that wasn’t a superhero movie but rather about something a little more close to home: isolation and alienation in a bizarre culture where everyone else seems to have a place. Joker is a disturbing film, without a doubt, but it does get close to the truth about life in America in 2019. Though I won’t go as far as Michael Moore, who believes it’s an indictment of Trump’s America – I do think it goes to the kind of hopelessness many in America and indeed the world are feeling right now. There is a reason that the Joker character resonates with people feel left behind. He is a reluctant hero, perhaps, as the film cleverly indicates, but the combination of the writing, the directing and most especially the performance of Joaquin Phoenix has delivered something you can’t look away from. It’s not a film that’s going to make anyone feel better about the state of things but it might be a film we all look back on someday and think, yeah, that movie told the truth about what life was like in 2019.</p>
