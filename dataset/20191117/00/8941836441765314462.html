      <p>An injury to Marlon Mack did little to slow the Indianapolis Colts’ running game on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Mack rushed 14 times for 109 yards and a touchdown before leaving with a hand injury in the third quarter of Indianapolis’ 33-13 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. His replacement, Jonathan Williams, had 13 carries for 106 yards, the first 100-yard game of his career.</p>
      <p>The Colts also lost rookie cornerback Rock Ya-Sin to an ankle injury in the third quarter.</p>
