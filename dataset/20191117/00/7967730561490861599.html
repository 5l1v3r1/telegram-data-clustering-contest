      <p>Police allege about 7.30pm the man had an altercation with the 18-year-old Noranda teenager and his friends and shortly after the man drove his Jeep Cherokee towards the group.</p>
      <p>The victim rode his bicycle through the shopping centre car park to escape the 4WD.</p>
      <p>Police allege as the victim was mounting a median strip the man drove his 4WD directly at the bike and continued to drive over the top of him.</p>
      <p>The vehicle came to a stop at the edge of the median strip.</p>
      <p>Police further allege the driver at no time checked on the welfare of the victim, who was lying on the ground behind the Jeep.</p>
      <p>The victim was taken to Royal Perth Hospital with life threatening injuries. By Sunday morning he was still in a serious condition.</p>
      <p>The driver of the Jeep was arrested a short time later by police.</p>
      <p>Deputy Police Commissioner Gary Dreibergs said the incident was 'beyond belief'.</p>
      <p>"It's beyond belief that somebody would get so close behind a person on their bicycle that they would hit them with their vehicle and knock them off," he said.</p>
      <p>"The consequences as we've seen are very serious and they could have even been more. Hopefully, they won't be more serious, our thoughts are with the young person in the hospital and we hope he does make a full recovery."</p>
      <p>The man was expected to appear before the Perth Magistrates Court on Sunday charged with dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm; failing to stop and ensure assistance received after an incident occasioning grievous bodily harm and failing to comply with a requirement to provide sample or accompany police (circumstance aggravated).</p>
