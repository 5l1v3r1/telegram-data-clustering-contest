      <p>The 27 floors will only have three or four rooms on each level, and rooms will have bespoke interiors and large windows. Some will have balconies and views of the Empire State Building.</p>
      <p>Design features include Portuguese-made light fixtures and headboards, custom throws evoking traditional tiles, and photography by Cátia Castel-Branco.</p>
      <p>All rooms will have full-length rotating mirrors with hangers attached, TVs, USB sockets and high-speed wifi.</p>

      <p>During the rest of the day it will be open for socializing or working.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile an outdoor courtyard will feature a mural design by Portuguese artist Manuel Cargaleirom.</p>
