      <h1>Anger as thieves use picture of dead son for fake fundraising</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:01:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Shaw</a></address>
      <p>A mum has slammed vile fraudsters who used her dead son's picture to create a bogus fundraising page - which also featured fake posts claiming to be from Harry Kane.</p>
      <p>Bailey Cooper was aged just nine when he passed away from cancer on Christmas Eve in 2017.</p>
      <p>The brave boy fought the disease for 15 months and held on just long enough to meet and name his newborn baby sister.</p>
      <p>His family, from Patchway, Bristol, had been doing their best to carry on in the years since his death - holding on to happy memories of him smiling whatever his condition.</p>
      <p>But they were left shaken when they discovered a sham Instagram profile and GoFundMe page for a boy called 'Declan' - using a photo of Bailey.</p>
      <p>The account, called harrykane_birthday, also hosted posts claiming to be by England captain Kane.</p>

      <p>It said that funds were being raised to organise a final birthday party for the child and they wanted his "favourite footballer" to attend - and had amassed 45,000 followers.</p>
      <p>Mum Rachel told the BBC: "My initial thought was 'this is a joke - this isn't real'. I was in shock that it had even happened,</p>
      <p>"I know it is not a nice world we live in nowadays but I didn't think it was this cruel.</p>
      <p>"It petrifies me and what makes it worse is that his little brother has seen it. He is really struggling.</p>
      <p>"It has put me off social media. I'm frightened about what will be taken from us."</p>

      <p>Both the account and the page have now been deleted.</p>
      <p>A GoFundMe spokeswoman said: "This campaign was proactively removed by our team within minutes of being posted.</p>
      <p>"At no point would the person who posted it have been able to get access to any donations."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Facebook, which owns Instagram, said: "We understand the distress this has caused the Cooper family.</p>
      <p>"Impersonation accounts are against our Community Guidelines and will be removed once we are made aware of them.</p>
      <p>"If someone believes they have spotted a fraudulent account, we'd encourage that they report it using our online form or in-app tools."</p>
      <p>Bailey first became ill in the summer of 2016 and after a series of tests was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma which was already in stage three when discovered.</p>

      <p>But doctors treated the cancer with chemotherapy and steroid medication - and were optimistic that Bailey would recover.</p>
      <p>He then went into remission in early 2017 and returned to school, although was subject to regular check ups and routine MRIs every three months.</p>
      <p>But when the family went on holiday that Easter they were dealt a devastating blow - that Bailey had relapsed.</p>
      <p>His condition then deteriorated over the following months and he sadly passed away on Christmas Eve with his family at his bedside.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of people turned out to pay their respects at Bailey's funeral including then Bristol Rovers FC captain Tom Lockyer, who struck up a friendship with the young football fan.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the time, Bailey's dad Lee said: “Bailey smiled through it all. He pulled funny faces and made people laugh, even though he was in so much pain.”</p>
