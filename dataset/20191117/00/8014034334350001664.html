      <h1>MacLean calls first "Hockey Night" without Cherry the "end of an era"</h1>

      <p>TORONTO — Ron MacLean said he will address Don Cherry’s dismissal during the first intermission of Saturday’s “Hockey Night in Canada” broadcast.</p>
      <p>MacLean opened Saturday’s show — the first since Sportsnet fired Don Cherry on Monday — by saying there were “obviously mixed emotions” ahead of the broadcast, and called it “the end of the era.”</p>
      <p>Cherry’s 38-year run on Hockey Night ended Monday, after he made on-air comments last Saturday which many felt were critical of immigrants for not wearing Remembrance Day poppies.</p>
      <p>MacLean, the longtime co-host of Coach’s Corner with Cherry, apologized last Sunday.</p>
      <p>Sportsnet said on Friday that Saturday’s first intermission would highlight the 2019 Hockey Hall of Fame inductees. The induction ceremony is Monday.</p>
      <p>Sportsnet also said they may eventually take the long-running first-intermission segment in a different direction.</p>
      <p>Cherry, an 85-year-old native of Kingston, Ont., joined HNIC in 1980 as a playoff analyst and was so popular that he was kept on as a colour commentator.</p>
      <p>CBC later created “Coach’s Corner” as a vehicle to showcase Cherry with MacLean eventually replacing Dave Hodge as his sidekick.</p>
