      <h1>How this Brooklyn man became the photographer to comedy A-listers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:48:39+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:48</time> by <a rel="author">Melkorka Licea</a></address>
      <p>He’s one of the biggest names in comedy — but you’ve probably never heard of him.</p>
      <p>Photographer Marcus Russell Price has toured with Amy Schumer, is a regular in Pete Davidson’s “SNL” dressing room and counts Dave Chappelle as a pal. It’s given him, and his lens, A-list access.</p>
      <p>“I’ve seen [their] jokes from birth until they hit the stage,” Price told The Post.</p>
      <p>It all began when the Fort Greene resident — whose only photography class was in high school — met comic Hannibal Buress in 2011, which led to him meeting the others.</p>
      <p>“I never considered photography as a career until Hannibal liked my photos,” said Price, 35, who was working as a graphic designer at the time and now posts his work <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marcusrussellprice/?hl=en">@marcusrussellprice</a> on Instagram.</p>
      <p>“You see old photos of people like Richard Pryor and you’re like, ‘Thank God someone was there to take that picture,’ ” Price said. “That person now is me.”</p>
      <p>Here are the stories behind some of his favorite snaps.</p>
      <h3>Aziz Ansari in Mumbai</h3>

      <p>During Ansari’s first tour of India — his family’s home country — last May, “it felt like the shows weren’t the focus of the trip,” said Price.</p>
      <p>The two spent most of their time wandering the streets of Mumbai and Delhi. “It was almost like we were on vacation together.”</p>
      <p>They were busy exploring spice, food and textile markets in Mumbai when they were ditched by their friends. “He turned around like, ‘Where do you wanna go next?’ and I took the shot,” said Price.</p>
      <h3>Amy Schumer on tour</h3>

      <p>Schumer’s 2016 world tour was her first time exclusively playing arenas. “There were tens of thousands of people every night. It was definitely a surreal experience,” said Price.</p>
      <p>After each performance, the photographer had the house lights turned up to get the perfect shot of Schumer facing her audience. But when the Long Island girl played Madison Square Garden, the sheer magnitude of the crowd caught up with her. “She turned around and just gave me this look,” Price recalled.</p>
      <h3>Pete Davidson at home</h3>

      <p>“Pete keeps a very tight circle,” said Price. “I have access most people don’t.” In February, the two were hanging out at the Staten Island home Davidson shares with his mother when the comedian decided to have tattoo artist Ryan Mullins come over.</p>
      <p>“One of his favorite things to do is to hang out, smoke, watch movies and get tattooed,” said Price. “I think he was getting a unicorn.”</p>
      <p>He added that Davidson is running out of skin: “Lately, he’s been going over tattoos. Not cover-ups, just overlaps.”</p>
