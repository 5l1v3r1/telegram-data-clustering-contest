      <p>"What does Declan Rice need to add to his game to become undroppable?' was the question put to Roy Keane ahead of England's Euro 2020 qualifier against Kosovo on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>Rice started the game in midfield for England.</p>
      <p>Keane started out slowly in his analysis of the 20-year-old before quickly moving through the gears.</p>
      <p>"Well, where he needs to improve, there are plenty of aspects," said Keane.</p>
      <p>"When you think about him, over the last few months, he's had a lot of praise.</p>
      <p>"I've looked at him pretty closely; I've worked with him when he was in the Irish squad.</p>
      <p>"Where he needs to improve, where do you want me to start? His positional play, I don't think he's been consistent enough, he doesn't stay with runners, he's sloppy in possession, I could go on.</p>
      <p>"He's one of these players that I think a couple of months ago, everyone was loving him and enjoying him but he's almost played his way out of the team because he's not been consistent at West Ham.</p>
      <p>"It is a position in the England team where Gareth isn't sure who's going to do that job in there. He's got an opportunity tonight and he's got to take it."</p>
