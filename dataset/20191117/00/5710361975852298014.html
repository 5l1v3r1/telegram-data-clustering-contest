      <h1>Saudi Aramco will not market IPO in the United States: sources</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco does not plan to market its domestic initial public offering (IPO) in the United States, two sources familiar with the matter said.</p>
      <p>Aramco had said in its IPO prospectus earlier this month that the offering of shares would rely on the 144A rule of the U.S. Securities Act, which allows a non-U.S. issuer to tap the U.S. market.</p>
      <p>The sources said Aramco will no longer rely on that rule, meaning it will not market the shares in the United States.</p>
      <p>Aramco did not immediately respond to a comment request.</p>
