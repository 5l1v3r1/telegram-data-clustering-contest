      <h1>Watch: Brian Kerr's Take On Euro 2020 Qualifying Process Is Absolute Gold</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Connaughton</a></address>
      <p>The qualifying process for Euro 2020 is a pretty complicated. Gone are the days of straightforward qualification based on your qualifying groups, with the Nations League ensuring that the path to next summer's finals are a bit more complicated.</p>
      <p>While the top two from each qualifying group will go straight to the tournament, the play-off places actually have nothing to do with the standings in those groups. They are instead determined by the ranking of teams in the Nations League.</p>
      <p>We know, it's all a bit stupid. Still, this is potentially good news for Ireland. Even if we fail to beat Denmark tomorrow night, we are already guaranteed a play-off.</p>
      <p>Each division of the Nations League will have their own play-offs, which means we could see a couple of new teams at next summer's finals.</p>
      <p>For example, the League D tournament is set to feature Kosovo, North Macedonia, Georgia and Belarus. One of those teams will qualify for the tournament for the first time as a result.</p>
      <p>One person who isn't a fan of this new layout is Brian Kerr. Speaking on <i>Virgin Media Sport</i> this evening, he had a rather humorous take on the proceedings.</p>

      <blockquote>I think it should be the 24 best teams. I don't think it should be 24 teams at all actually, 16 was enough. Eight (teams) was great for the level of the competition.<br/>I think you should have to earn it by merit, not by beating teams of your own standard because you're brutal and the others are a little bit more brutal!<br/>You can beat them and get yourselves into the final based on that. You should be like Albania qualifying the previous time, or Iceland getting to the World Cup, based on merit.</blockquote>
      <p>He has a point, with the whole thing seemingly becoming a bit of a farce. In saying that, we won't complain if this is the route Ireland end up taking to the tournament.</p>
