      <h1>No. 6 Gamecocks’ hot start leads to 92-50 App State blowout</h1>

      <p>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Mikiah Herbert Harrigan had a season-high 21 points and No. 6 South Carolina used a huge first quarter to roll past Appalachian State 92-50 on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Gamecocks outscored the Mountaineers 35-3 in the opening period, matching the fewest points they’d ever allowed in a quarter. It equaled the three given up to Belmont in the second quarter of an NCAA first-round victory last March and Savannah State in the third quarter of a December 2017 victory.</p>
      <p>Things got out of hand in a hurry as freshmen Aliyah Boston, Brea Beal and Zia Cooke - all part of the Gamecocks’ No. 1 ranked recruiting class - scored every point in South Carolina’s 9-0 start. Herbert Harrigan made three baskets and by the time Tyasha Harris hit a 3-pointer and a jumper on consecutive possessions, the Gamecocks (4-0) were up 32-0.</p>

      <p>Lainey Gosnell finally ended the drought for Appalachian State (0-3) with a 3-pointer with 20 seconds left in the period. The Mountaineers shot 1 of 18 with seven turnovers, most of them leading to easy scores for South Carolina.</p>
      <p>Things didn’t get much better for Appalachian State going forward. The Mountaineers scored only six points in the second quarter and trailed 53-9 as South Carolina emptied its bench before the break.</p>

        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>Appalachian State: The Mountaineers had a rugged start to the season with losses at VCU and South Carolina, both preseason favorites in their conferences. In between was a heartbreaking, 67-66 loss in overtime to Elon. Appalachian State coach Angel Elderkin believes this stretch can help her program when Sun Belt Conference play comes around.</p>
        <p>South Carolina: Usually defense is the last to come around with a team that has five newcomers in the rotation, but that’s not the case with the Gamecocks. They held Appalachian State to 26.9% and have not allowed an opponent, including No. 8 Maryland, to shoot better than 32% this season.</p>
