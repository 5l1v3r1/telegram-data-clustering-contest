      <h1>General election 2019: Green Party pledge £12 minimum wage for all 16-year-olds</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:01:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>The Green Party have pledged a £12-an-hour minimum wage for anyone over 16 by 2022.</p>
      <p>The eyebrow-raising election pledge outstrips the wildest dreams of the Tories or even <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> in a bid to ensure all youngsters earn the living wage.</p>
      <p>It comes days after the Greens also <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-green-party-backs-20891527">pledged a universal basic income of £89 a week for all adults by 2025.</a></p>
      <p>By comparison, Labour has said it would pay all over-16s £10.81 an hour by 2024 and trial the Universal Basic Income, but not commit to bring it in.</p>
      <p>The Tories have pledged a £10.50-an-hour minimum wage by 2024 but only for over-21s.</p>

      <p>The Green Party's generous offer would of course depend on the party winning a Westminster majority at odds of 1,000/1. Currently, the party has just one seat.</p>
      <p>Under the current system, the minimum wage for under-18s is £4.35, for 18 to 20-year-olds it is £6.15, and for 21 to 24-year-olds it is £7.71.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile apprentices can be paid as little as £3.90.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Greens co-leader Sian Berry said: "The Living Wage must mean what it says on the tin.</p>
      <p>"The Green Party will end the discrimination against young people where it is legal to pay under-21s a genuine pittance for doing exactly the same work as someone older.</p>
      <p>"It isn’t fair, it doesn’t make sense, and it must stop."</p>
