      <h1>Fizdale Explains What Will Define Success For 3-10 Knicks</h1>

      <p>GREENBURGH, N.Y. – Success will not be defined by the won-loss record, but rather by the tough-to-quantify measure known as “progress.” “Are we getting better? Are our young guys improving? Are we starting to finish games the way we talked about? Are our young guys improving? Are we eliminating the games that we just want to drop-kick out the door and starting to build a real consistency where we give ourselves a chance to win every night?” Fizdale said Sunday afternoon at the team’s suburban practice facility.</p>
      <p>Coming off a tough-to-swallow loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday night in which Devonte Graham beat them with a 3-point shot with 2.1 seconds left, the Knicks have a revenge game coming up Monday night against the Cleveland Cavaliers – the team that defeated the Knicks so soundly last Sunday that it prompted team president Steve Mills and general manager Scott Perry to take the post-game podium ahead of Fizdale – at the behest of owner Jim Dolan – to provide an explanation.</p>

      <p>In New York, it was considered a death knell for Fizdale, whose team nonetheless came back with a victory over the Dallas Mavericks and a fairly strong performance against the Hornets – leading by as many as 15 before Charlotte staged a comeback with Graham hitting nine 3s.</p>
      <p>It is a learning process for rookie R.J. Barrett, who remains a Rookie of the Year candidate despite the poor record.</p>
      <p>“Me, I’m playing against people that I’ve never played against in my life,” Barrett said. “Devonte Graham, I’ve never seen him, and then he has nine 9 3s. But I’ve always felt like an underdog, especially being from Canada. I’ve always felt counted out when I come down to the United States.”</p>

      <p>Barrett is 3rd among NBA rookies in scoring at 15.8 points per game. Only Kendrick Nunn of the Miami Heat and Ja Morant of the Memphis Grizzlies are averaging more. He leads all rookies in minutes per game (34.2).</p>
      <p>Looking to the future, only Barrett, Mitchell Robinson and Julius Randle figure to be long-term pieces of the puzzle for the Knicks in their long-term rebuild, and exactly whose job may be on the line is the subject of debate.</p>
      <p>Some believe it may actually be Perry, who was lured out of Sacramento two summers ago and whose only other first-round pick aside from Barrett was Kevin Knox, who is heaving a dreadful season, shooting just 38 percent from the field and averaging just 7.6 points.</p>
      <p>At a certain point, Knox will be judged as almost all NBA players are: Either a “bust” or “keeper.”</p>

      <p>“Kevin is a critical and important part of what we are doing,” said Fizdale, who has been bringing Knox off then bench.</p>
      <p>Either way, the highlight of the Knicks’ season may have been last week’s victory over the Mavericks in which the crowd turned on ex-Knick Kristaps Porzingis and the ‘Bockers fed off the crowd.</p>
      <p>New York has defeated Dallas twice, and now heads into a stretch of schedule with an extraordinarily tough stretch following the Cleveland game: Philadelphia, then San Antonio, Brooklyn, Toronto, Boston, Milwaukee and Denver.</p>

      <p>If Fizdale survives, it will be because the Knicks won a couple of those difficult games. He still has more than two years left on his four-year contract ... so maybe folks are being a little too quick to pull the trigger in predicting his imminent demise.</p>
      <p>Then again, he serves at the behest of Jim Dolan, who has ushered many a coach out of the Garden ... sometimes with security guards leading them down the exit ramp.</p>

      <p>Clearly, a last-place finish in the Leastern Conference will not go over well with a fan base that has endured two consecutive decades without a trip to the NBA Finals.</p>
      <p>For now, the Knicks get a shot at revenge against the Cavs, whose young, speedy backcourt presents New York with exactly the type of roster they have had trouble defending. But a win could turn things around mentally for them as they head into that difficult stretch.</p>
      <p>Only time will tell whether Fizdale survives it.</p>
      <p>The only certainty is that Dolan will.</p>
