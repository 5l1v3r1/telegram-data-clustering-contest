        <b>Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 99th goal with Portugal, who won against Luxembourg and booked their place in the Euro 2020. After the game, he celebrated the win with the media... and spoke about his anger after being substituted with Juventus in the last game against Milan.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"In the last three weeks, I've been playing conditioned.<b> I don't like to be substituted</b>, but I've been playing conditioned and I've been trying to help Juventus. I understand the changes, I was not right. In these two matches with Portugal<b> I was not 100% either</b>. But I'm very proud to<b> sacrifice myself for the national team or for my club,</b>" explained <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/c-ronaldo-28185">Cristiano Ronaldo.</a></p>
      <p>CR7 said he did everything to lend a hand. "Inter are two points behind us and<b> I sacrificed myself to help the team</b>, just as I did with the national team, who needed to win these two games. In my career I have never had serious injuries, <b>I usually play between 50 and 60 games,</b> but I'm having some discomfort that prevents me from being 100%. Someone should have spoken, especially the coach or myself, but you know I don't talk much with the press," he justified.</p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo tried to put an end to his anger after being substituted against Lokomotiv and, above all, against Milan, where<b> Mauricio Sarri brought him off to make way to other teammates</b>. The reason was physical, and even the player admitted his problems, but that did not make the striker obviate his anger. In fact, <b>his attitude caused some controversy after not waiting for the Juventus-Milan game to finish</b> and he left the stadium.</p>
      <p>"The goal was to be in the Euro and we've done it. But <b>the fact that we won in 2016 doesn't mean we're favourites</b>. We're a team that's hard to beat, but there are other favourites" said CR7.</p>

      <p>.Cristiano Ronaldo was questioned about Dani's words about the World Cups won if he was born in Brazil. <b>"I'm very proud of being Portuguese</b>. I didn't change my nationality for any other reason. With Portugal, I won a Europe and a Nations League," he summed up.</p>
      <p>As for the match against Luxembourg, where he scored the second goal, he complained about the turf. <b>"It's difficult to play on these pitches</b>. It was terrible, I don't know how it's possible to allow it to be played in these conditions. It's bad for the players, for the fans and for the show," he lamented.</p>
      <p><b>"My 100th goal will come naturally</b>. Records are there to be beaten and I will beat them. I'm happy to play in the European Championship," said Cristiano Ronaldo on his 99th goal.</p>
