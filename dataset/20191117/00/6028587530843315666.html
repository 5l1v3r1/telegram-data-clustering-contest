      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Sarubbi</a></address>
      <p>There are several reasons to expect a pull back in the market in the coming week:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The market ran up into a projected turning point Â on Friday, the 15<sup>th</sup></li>
        <li>The weekly S&amp;P cycle falls into the 20<sup>th</sup></li>
        <li>The coming week is post-OPEX week which usually brings a retracement of the OPEX week strength</li>
        <li>The NASDAQ triggered both Hindenburg Omen and Titanic Syndrome warnings in the past week</li>
        <li>Breadth has not been strong as the index hit new highs.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The IBM weekly cycle bottoms on the 18<sup>th</sup> and tops on December 15<sup>th</sup>. All five buy signals have been successful in the prior year. In the second half of November, Big Blue has risen 64.1% in the last 39 years. In fact, the November through January time period has been the most bullish time interval in any year. The stock is likely to rally to $143 or higher by December. The stock has made two higher lows since May.</p>

      <p>The weekly Colgate Palmolive cycle turns down now. All five sell signals and all four buy signals have been successful in the last year. The upcoming week has been seasonally bearish over the last 38 years. The likelihood of lower prices is enhanced by the condition of the stock. Chart 4 shows weak momentum and falling relative strength. The shares may reach the low $60 area by the end of the month.</p>
