      <p>A Pizza Express branch has been bombarded with fake reviews after Prince Andrew mentioned it during his interview about the dead paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>During last nights BBC special, The Duke of York said  he couldn't have had sex with his accuser Victoria Roberts because he was out with his daughter at the restaurant in Woking.</p>
      <p>The claim prompted scores of web users to leave a series of bogus reviews of the branch on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a>, many making reference to the allegations surrounding the prince.</p>
      <p>Andrew spoke on Newsnight for the first time about his relationship with convicted sex offender Epstein.</p>
      <p>He told TV host Emily Maitlis he did not remember meeting the billionaire's alleged victim Ms Roberts, now known as Virgina Giuffre.</p>

      <p>Virginia, then 17, has accused Andrew of having sex with her in 2001, when she flew to London on Epstein's jet before enjoying dinner and then going to Tramp nightclub with the Prince.</p>
      <p>But the prince claimed he was at a branch of Pizza Express in Woking, Surrey, on March 10, 2001 instead.</p>
      <p>He said: "I was with the children and I'd taken Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking for a party at I suppose sort of 4pm or 5pm in the afternoon."</p>
      <p>Asked why he remembered going to Pizza Express 'so specifically', Andrew replied: "Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do, a very unusual thing for me to do.</p>
      <p>"I've never been...I've only been to Woking a couple of times and I remember it weirdly distinctly.</p>
      <p>"As soon as somebody reminded me of it, I went: 'Oh yes, I remember that'."</p>

      <p>Ms Maitlis also mentioned that Virginia had claimed they had danced at Tramp and Andrew was 'profusely sweating'.</p>
      <p>The Queen's son replied: "I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don't sweat or I didn't sweat at the time.</p>
      <p>"Because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simply...it was almost impossible for me to sweat."</p>
      <p>Fake reviews began appearing in Google within minutes of the programme ending and have continued for several hours. </p>
      <p>One wrote: "Pizza express Woking is like no other pizza express! It’s a memory which will never disappear once you visit the Woking branch. It’s amazing the lasting effect a pizza can have on you!</p>
      <p>Another one said: "I’ve forgotten visits to my billionaire friend’s private island, but I have never forgotten my single visit to this particular restaurant on a specific day nearly 20 years ago."</p>

      <p>A third commented: "Great Pizza! I can't sweat. I have no recollection of eating the pineapple and ham. But I definitely remember going there because it was unusual. Paid a princely sum!"</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Pizza Express itself responded on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> as they posted a picture showing a glass of wine in front of a laptop.</p>
      <p>The caption read: "9:00pm - Switch off computer [wine emoji]</p>
      <p>"10:00pm - 120 messages on work WhatsApp group telling you to 'check Twitter now'"</p>
