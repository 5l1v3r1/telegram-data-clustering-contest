      <p>England batsman Jos Buttler spoke of his excitement to be back playing cricket after a challenging summer at home, which included both – the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2019 and the Ashes.</p>
      <p>Buttler top-scored for England with an 153-ball 110, before being dismissed Scott Kuggeleijn who had come in as a concussion substitute for opener Hamish Rutherford, in their three-day practice match against New Zealand A in Whangarei, which concluded on Sunday, 17 November.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old had been rested from the five-match T20I series which concluded with a thrilling super-over finish a week ago, and he termed the break as 'invaluable', citing it as a reason for the rediscovered excitement. </p>

      <p>"It was a tough summer. Great fun but a huge challenge which took a lot out of most of us," Buttler said. "So it was good to have some time away from the game and get refreshed. I've had four or five weeks off and that has been invaluable. It's allowed us to refresh, have time away and get excited to come back."</p>
      <p>England had found themselves facing the prospect of what would have been a worrying defeat in the warm-up, after both Joe Root and Ben Stokes were dismissed cheaply leaving them at a precarious 105/5 in response to New Zealand A's first innings score of 302/6 declared. However, Buttler - along with Joe Denly and Ollie Pope who both hit half-centuries and Jofra Archer who finished with an unbeaten 41 – ensured safety for the visitors.</p>

      <p>"I'm absolutely aware of my record as regards scoring first-class centuries," said the England batsman who had scored just five first-class hundreds before this match, and only one since 2014. "It's something I've been very light on, really. I know this was a warm-up match but it's nice to spend time in the middle and get to three figures."</p>
      <p>Buttler puts his renewed success down to work he has done with former England opener Marcus Trescothick, who also captained him at Somerset. "I went down to Somerset to work with Marcus Trescothick, who is someone I know really well. I got a lot out of it.</p>
      <p>"It gave some building blocks - more around my set-up, really, trying to be in the right place at the right time when the ball is released - to coming here and feeling in good touch."</p>
