      <h1>Highlights! Former UFC fighter Ross Pearson KO’d by stunning rolling thunder kick</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:52:54+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:52</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Hiergesell</a></address>
      <p>Former UFC fighter Ross Pearson can’t seem to catch a break these days, even in his debut for Probellum MMA.</p>
      <p>Pearson, 35, entered the cage earlier tonight (Sat., Nov. 16, 2019) at Probellum 1 in London, England, in search of his first professional win since defeating Mizuto Hirota via decision nearly two years ago. Not only did “Real Deal” leave empty handed but he suffered the most brutal knockout defeat of his 15-year MMA career.</p>
      <p>Pearson’s Probellum debut came against French veteran Davy Gallon, who took the former UFC fighter into the third round. While the two fighters circled one another on the feet Gallon launched a ridiculous rolling thunder kick. Fight fans are used to seeing this type of move used at the end of a round with very limited success, but the attack connected flush with Pearson and immediately cut the lights off.</p>
      <p>Check the finish out below:</p>

      <p>Pretty intense, huh?</p>
      <p>While this is easily one of the best knockouts of 2019 it’s an extremely unfortunate beginning to Pearson’s Probellum MMA career. The accomplished English fighter had compiled 26 fights in UFC prior to this bout with Gallon, who has been fighting on the open circuit his entire career, but it didn’t matter.</p>
      <p>Pearson got caught and Gallon walked away with one of the best finishes you will ever see.</p>
