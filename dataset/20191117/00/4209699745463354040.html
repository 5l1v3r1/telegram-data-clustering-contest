      <p>An Appeal Court sitting in Owerri on Saturday sacked Obinna<br/>Onwubuariri, the member representing Isiala Mbano/Onuimo/Okigwe<br/>federal constituency of Imo in the House of representatives.<br/><br/>The court also nullified the election of Uju Onwudiwe of the Action<br/>Alliance (AA) representing Njaba state constituency and ordered fresh<br/>elections in 12 polling units within 90 days.<br/><br/>The PDP candidate, Charles Abia had challenged the victory of Onwudiwe<br/>in the appeal court.<br/><br/>The Chairman of the Panel, Justice R.N Pemu, who read the judgment,<br/>said that the election that brought Onwubuariri of the Peoples<br/>Democratic Party (PDP) to power on February 23 was not in tandem with<br/>the electoral act of 2010, as amended.<br/><br/>The appellate court said the lower court was right to have ordered a<br/>fresh election in the federal constituency.<br/><br/>Pemu said the petitioner, Miriam Onuoha of the All Progressives<br/>Congress (APC), was able to prove her allegations of over-voting,<br/>mutilation of figures and violence which marred the election.<br/><br/>The court, therefore, ordered the Independent National Electoral<br/>Commission (INEC) to withdraw the certificate of return it had earlier<br/>issued Onwubuariri and conduct a fresh election in the entire federal<br/>constituency within 90 days.<br/><br/>The tribunal had sacked Onwubuariri, but the lawmaker dissatisfied<br/>with the judgment appealed the judgment.</p>
