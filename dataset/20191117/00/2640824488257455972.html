      <p><b><a href="http://www.animal-farm.co.za/">hefer’s</a> collection of three suspended orbs bear titles that relate to the chemical compounds they represent: dihydrogen monoxide, fluoroheliate monoxide and hydrogen difluoride.</b> each of the pieces is wrapped in bold, brilliant leathers that pay homage to the international color codes atoms are known by — white for hydrogen, red for oxygen, green for chlorine. internally, the pods are plushly lined with sheepskin, inviting people to climb inside and nestle within.</p>

      <p><b>the ‘molecules’ have been manufactured by the leather artisans at <a href="https://za.wolfandmaiden.com/">wolf &amp; maiden</a> in cape town</b>. founder wade ross skinner and his team of leathersmiths worked closely with hefer, applying impeccable craftsmanship on a large scale. the collection is inspired by the idea of molecules being made up of atoms held together by chemical bonds that form as a result of the sharing or exchange of electrons. the project also continues the artist’s ongoing fascination with the reactions and energy a piece can generate within a space. <b>find ‘molecules’ at <a href="https://southernguild.co.za/">southern guild’s</a> booth at <a href="https://miami2019.designmiami.com/">design miami/ 2019</a>.</b></p>
