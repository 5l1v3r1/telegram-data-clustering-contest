      <h1>Ohio school faces backlash after teacher shows meme of Dora as injured undocumented immigrant</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:46:54+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/marina-pitofsky" target="_blank">Marina Pitofsky</a></address>
      <p>Parents and students at an Ohio high school were outraged after an Advanced Placement government teacher used an edited photo of the beloved cartoon character Dora the Explorer and a prisoner to teach a lesson on voter eligibility Thursday. </p>
      <p>A teacher at West Geauga High School in Chesterland, Ohio reportedly showed the image of Dora, who is edited to be taking a mug shot for an “illegal border crossing” and “resisting arrest” in the photo. She also has a black eye and blood running out of her mouth, and she is next to what appears to be a convicted felon. The teacher was trying to show an image of two people who would be ineligible to vote, <a href="https://fox8.com/2019/11/14/west-geuga-high-school-teacher-under-investigation-after-presenting-controversial-image-during-class/">according to Fox8.</a></p>
      <p>Dora the Explorer is a child, and Nickelodeon, which produced the popular TV show, has declined to comment on her background, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8698065.stm">according to the BBC.</a></p>
      <p>In a statement West Geauga Local Schools Superintendent Richard Markwardt said “We are investigating the matter related to the politically-insensitive slides allegedly contained in a teacher’s classroom presentation today. he teacher has been placed on leave pending the results of the investigation." </p>
      <p>In a statement sent to students and parents, Markwardt said that “The material has been examined, the matter investigated, and the issue is being resolved.” He told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/11/16/teacher-uses-meme-dora-explorer-an-illegal-border-crosser-lesson-about-voting/">The Washington Post</a> that the image was inappropriate, but it was not shown with malicious intent. He said he would not fire the teacher. </p>
      <p>“I will not use what I regard as a lapse of judgment as the reason to damage the career of a good teacher,” Markwardt said. “That would be following one mistake with another.” </p>
      <p>He told the Washington Post that he will call on staff to honor diversity, and he may recommend training for individual educators.</p>
      <p>“I perceive the use of the objectionable image as symptomatic of a general lack of attention to the diversity of individuals in a largely homogeneous school district,” he said.  </p>
      <p>A parent told Fox8 that she was “outraged” after she saw the photo. </p>
      <p>“Seeing that white supremacist juxtaposed with a brown skinned child who has a superimposed black eye, blood coming from her mouth with the offense of illegal border crossing and resisting arrest combined with 666 666666 is 100% inappropriate,” The mother said. Multiple other parents reportedly called the school district to complain. </p>
      <p>The meme is approximately 10 years old, according to the Washington Post. It dates back to 2009 when it came to popularity after then-Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R) signed an immigration bill into law making it a crime not to carry immigration documents. It also gave police the ability to detain people they suspect of being undocumented immigrants.</p>
