      <p>The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare battle royale leaked information also reveals that the upcoming battle royale mode could include up to 200 players instead of last year’s 100. Three game modes include Solo, Duo and Squads.</p>
      <p>As for player perks, these will come in different forms allowing players to create a build which they can use with their squads. “Deep-Pockets” allows players to find extra usage for any picked-up equipment. “Sleight of Hand” grants 50% faster ammo reloading time. “Healer” gives your medic items a 25% more effect on your and your squad and Thief lets you generate 20% more plunder. There are a lot more perks you can read about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dx4me0/battle_royale_coming_to_modern_warfare_map/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>The leak goes on to reveal the game mode’s loot which includes rarities of White, Gree, Blue, Purple, and Gold. According to the data, players will be rewarded for collecting the most loot with a “Best Plunderer” title.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that this can all change before the mode releases next year. However, the leak is quite detailed and could be something to look forward to when the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare battle royale mode goes live in early 2020. If anything, it sounds like a giant step up from last year’s mode.</p>
