        <b>Cristiano Ronaldo had a tough game in Luxembourg. The Portugal captain was not at his best and throughout various stages of the contest, he had to put up with chants from the stand talking about Leo Messi. That said, CR7 had the last laugh.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the ninth minute of the game, <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/c-ronaldo-28185">Cristiano</a><b> had his first opportunity</b>. He cut inside twice inside the box looking for a goal. The ball ended up in GK Moris' hands and <b>the Portuguese looked down at the floor</b>. </p>
      <p>The state of the pitch was not good at all and CR7 complained on several occasions, <b>but it was not until the 27th minute</b> when he heard the name of his main rival. </p>

      <p>Cristiano shot from outside the box and the ball did not find the target.<b> He complained about the pitch once again</b> and the crowd responded with chants of "Messi, Messi."</p>
      <p>However, <b>the Portugal star had the final say a few minutes from the end.</b> He tapped in on the line after Diogo Jota's shot. UEFA credited him with the goal and Ronaldo is now on 99 goals for <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/seleccion-portugal/">Portugal</a>. <b>That goal sealed the win</b> and qualification for Euro 2020 next summer. </p>
