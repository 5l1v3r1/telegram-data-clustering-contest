      <p>Perhaps it is a sign of progress.The Atlanta Braves signed left-handed reliever Will Smith to a three-year, $40-million contract as a free agent Thursday. It marked a significant move early in the free-agent process following two offseasons in which most of the players on the open market weren’t signed until at least January.</p>
      <p>The Major League Baseball Players Association has become increasing agitated with the owners’ inaction in free agency. Executive director Tony Clark has all but accused management of outright collusion.</p>
      <p>The state of free agency figures to be perhaps the biggest negotiating point in the next collecting bargaining agreement. The current CBA expires after the 2021 season and there is already speculation about the MLBPA going on strike for the first time since 1994.</p>
      <p>What Smith’s quick signing truly means remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>The Braves’ M.O. last winter was to move quickly in free agency, signing third baseman Josh Donaldson and catcher Brian McCann to one-year deals early in the process. General manager Alex Anthopoulos has also re-signed three free agents to one-year contracts in the past few weeks: right-handed reliever Darren O’Day, catcher Tyler Flowers and right fielder Nick Markakis.</p>
      <p>Smith fills the Braves’ glaring need for a closer. The 30-year-old is coming off a season in which he was 6-0 with 34 saves and a 2.76 ERA in 63 games for the San Francisco Giants.</p>
      <p>Smith also had reasons for signing quickly.</p>
      <p>For one, he is a native of Newman, Ga., and grew up in the Atlanta area. The allure of playing for the hometown team is often irresistible.</p>
      <p>Smith and his representatives at Creative Artists Agency could have also concluded the Braves’ offer might have been the best one he was going to get.</p>
      <p>Craig Kimbrel’s sojourn in free agency last winter might serves as a cautionary tale. Like Smith, Kimbrel turned down a qualifying offer from the Boston Red Sox, meaning the signing team would forfeit amateur draft pick compensation.</p>
      <p>Kimbrel wound up not until June. He agreed to the three-year, $43-million contract with the Chicago Cubs following the draft, when compensation was no longer attached to him.</p>
      <p>Smith got nearly the same deal without having to wait eight months.</p>
      <p>Whether the Smith signing was an aberration or the start of a steady flow of signings won’t be known for a few weeks. However, right-hander Adam Wainwright’s decision to re-sign with the St. Louis Cardinals for a second straight offseason without even listening to offers from other teams could be telling.</p>
      <p>Wainwright signed a one-year, $5-million deal that includes the opportunity to make $5 million more in performance bonuses. This past season, he earned $10 million on a one-year contract, $2 million in salary and $8 million in bonuses.</p>
      <p>Wainwright going back to the Cardinals is far from shocking news. At 38 and having spent his entire 15-year major league career in St. Louis, it was likely always going to be either re-sign with the Cardinals or retire.</p>
      <p>However, it is interesting to note that Wainwright made a militant pro-labor comment in spring training when star free agents Bryce Harper and Manny Machado remained unsigned. Wainwright predicted the players would likely walk off the job by midseason because of their free-agency frustrations.</p>
      <p>The wildcat strike never materialized, and Wainwright quickly signed back with the Cardinals. Couple that with the quick signing of Smith and maybe the relationship between the players and owners may be headed toward a winter thaw.</p>
      <p>Emphasis on maybe.</p>
