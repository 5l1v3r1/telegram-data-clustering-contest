      <p>Report from RNZ<br/>Actress Nancy Brunning, who played roles ranging from Nurse Jaki in <i>Shortland Stree</i>t to matriarch Ramona Mahana in the film <i>Mahana</i>, has died at the age of 48.</p>
      <p>Brunning won a Best Actress award at the New Zealand Film Awards for her role in the <i>Once were Warriors</i> sequel, <i>What Becomes of the Broken Hearted.</i></p>
      <p>Her friends had recently launched a crowdsourcing campaign to help to fund a non-subsidised life-prolonging drug.</p>
      <p>“Our māmā, our sister, our aunty, our friend, she has followed the call of her tīpuna,” broadcaster Stacey Morrison posted on Facebook, on behalf of Brunning’s whānau. “Nancy’s passion was to bring unheard stories to the light. To remind our people that our voices are a powerful tool and aroha is the most important thing of all. And while she was loved by the world, she was loved even more by us. She was the person that bound our whānau together.”</p>
      <p>“We wish to express our deep gratitude and mihi to everyone who has supported Nancy and our whānau. Thank you to the kind people at Mary Potter Hospice and the hardworking staff at Wellington Hospital. Thank you to all of you who supported her battle in many ways, including the Manaakitia fundraiser.</p>
      <p>Moe mai rā Nan. Hoki atu ki ōu mātua tīpuna. Ka noho mātou ki roto i te mamae, me te aroha mutunga kore ki a koe.”</p>
      <p>RNZ film reviewer Sarah McMullan said Nancy Brunning was a phenomenal actress, and a talented director and playwright.</p>
      <p>Morrison told RNZ it’s a sad day for Brunning’s whānau and all those who loved her.</p>
      <p>“We’re already seeing how huge an impact Nancy’s passing is having on people as she’s bringing back memories – incredible feelings of how she impacted people with her performance and mostly with her desire to tell untold stories.”</p>
      <p>Morrison said Brunning would have thought her most important role was being a mother and whānau member.</p>
      <p>“She will be remembered as a trailblazer in terms of Māori storytelling and art, performance and expression.”</p>
      <p>Her body will be taken to Raukawa Marae in Ōtaki.</p>
