        <b>In-form Gideon Mensah believes he did enough on his international debut to become a permanent member of the Black Stars. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The on-loan Zulte-Waregem left back impressed on Thursday night in the 2-0 win over South Africa in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.</p>
      <p>''Yes, for sure I would like to stay in the team, but it’s the decision of the coach,'' he said. But for me and from what I delivered today I’m here to stay,'' he said.</p>
      <p>The former WAFA SC, now owned by Austrian giants Red Bull Salzburg, did a good job by keeping the tabs on danger man Percy Tau at the Cape Coast Stadium.</p>
      <p>He admits such consistent displays will help him regularize his stay in the team.</p>
      <p>''I’m not going to relax because of my performance against South Africa. I will keep my head up and keep working hard for the team,'' he added.</p>
