        <b>Ferrari Formula 1 team-mates Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc have been summoned to see the Brazilian Grand Prix stewards over the collision that took them both out of the race.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The pair were battling for fourth soon after the first safety car restart when the incident occurred.</p>
      <p>Leclerc had overtaken Vettel into the first corner but his team-mate had the better run onto the following straight and moved back ahead, only to make contact with the sister car as he did so.</p>
      <p>While Leclerc had to park immediately with broken suspension, a rear puncture meant Vettel did not get much further.</p>
      <p>Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto suggested "both of them have got at least a small percentage of responsibility" for the clash in an interview with Sky.</p>
      <p>"I think the drivers need to feel sorry for the team - because at the end, they were free to fight," added Binotto.</p>

      <p>"Free to fight but they know that silly mistakes are something we should avoid for the team itself.</p>
      <p>"And today it has been a very small contact I have to say, but there will be time to analyse it, there will be time to look at the video, I don't want to do that in the heat.</p>
      <p>"With the drivers, I had already a chat with them and I don't want to judge now, they should not judge now, there will be a time to do it all together."</p>
      <p>Both drivers expressed fury about the other over team radio but then calmed by the time they talked to television crews.</p>
      <p>"I didn't have much space to the right and obviously had a better run out of Turn 3 and tried to pass, that's it," said Vettel, who called it "a shame for the team obviously".</p>
      <p>Leclerc suggested Vettel "started to squeeze me a little bit to the inside, and we were very close. Everything happened very quickly, and as soon as he went to the inside we touched".</p>
      <p>But he added: "I'm pretty sure we are mature enough to put that behind us".</p>
