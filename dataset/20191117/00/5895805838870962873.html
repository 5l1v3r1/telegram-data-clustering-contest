      <p>A therapist colleague recently told me that as she anticipates spending time with her <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/narcissism">narcissistic</a> parents this holiday season, she feels tense, pessimistic and down.</p>
      <p>“I feel like I have Holiday Affective Disorder,” she said, in a tongue-in-cheek takeoff on <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder">Seasonal Affective Disorder</a>, or SAD.</p>
      <p>If you are planning to spend time with narcissistic family members or in-laws this holiday season, ask yourself these five questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Do you get tense when thinking about a holiday family visit?</li>
        <li>Do you anticipate <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stressful</a>, demeaning and/or painful interactions?</li>
        <li>Do you expect visits will be more negative than positive?</li>
        <li>Do you worry that you may regress to early family roles or mood states around family members?</li>
        <li>Do you feel more of an obligation than a desire to spend time with family members?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you answered yes to two or more of these questions, you may have “Narcissist-Family-Holiday Affective Disorder.”</p>
      <p>Of course, I use that term as a lighthearted description for what can be a painful reality. Holiday interactions with narcissistic family members can be strewn with emotional land mines that seem more explosive than at other times of the year.</p>
      <p>Even in healthier families, it is normal for expectations and sensitivities to feel magnified during the year-end holiday season. We may have memories of seasons past that are picture-perfect, which we hope to replicate or exceed, as well as sobering or even excruciating holiday memories, which we seek to avoid. Both types of memories can add pressure to the holidays.</p>
      <p>In addition, we may seek to cram months or years of catching up and socializing with family members into a few hours or days, which can also increase pressure.</p>

      <p>For those with narcissistic family members, holiday stress can go beyond the normal sources of pressure. During holidays, many narcissists tend to become more <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention">attention</a>-hungry, prickly, entitled, and provocative than during the rest of the year.</p>
      <p>At the same time, family members' emotional reactivity to such behavior may be higher than normal during the holidays.</p>
      <p>If you are feeling anxious in anticipating interactions with narcissistic family members this year, it may be worth thinking about or talking with a friend, partner, or therapist whether it is best for you to be with family this holiday season.</p>
      <p>List the pros and cons. Imagine the worst-case scenario if you see narcissistic family members, then imagine the worst-case scenario if you don’t go. Of course, worst-case scenarios may be unlikely, but it can be freeing to consider how you would cope if the worst happens.</p>
      <p>Based on your answers, you may wish to modify a planned trip or forego a visit this year. Some family members may be upset by your decision, but you are not doing this to hurt anybody. You are choosing what is healthy for you. You have the right to avoid unpleasant or abusive behavior. That’s one of your jobs as an adult.</p>
      <p>If you do choose to spend time around a narcissistic family member or in-law, here are five ways to sidestep some of the common narcissistic family pitfalls and create a more nurturing holiday season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1) Be a detective of family dysfunction</b>
      </p>
      <p>In stressful or overwhelming situations, one excellent option is simple observation. You might try approaching a holiday family visit in the role of family “detective.”</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/article-inline-half-caption/public/field_blog_entry_images/2019-11/shutterstock_1012179502.jpg?itok=IiT6GTXp"/>

      </figure>
      <p>From the moment of contact with family members, let your inner detective begin noticing. How do family members say hello? How do they express needs and feelings? What are the tribal norms? What is discouraged or forbidden? How do those who seek control keep others in line?</p>
      <p>Equally important, notice how being in such an environment affects you. What happens to your body, moods, thoughts, and especially your view of self?</p>
      <p>Whether your style is Sherlock Holmes or Columbo, Inspector Gadget or Inspector Clouseau, or Miss Marple or Veronica Mars, being a detective can be freeing. Because your goal is simply to observe events, nothing that happens is “wrong.” Everything that happens offers potential clues for figuring out how the family and members within it function. Then, in quiet moments during or after the visit, you can make sense of what you observed.</p>
      <p>Taking an observer stance can insulate you by taking the pressure off yourself. Instead of evaluating how you are doing, you are observing what others are doing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2) Give yourself lifelines</b>
      </p>
      <p>You have the right to excuse yourself from a conversation at any time for any reason. Though narcissists may view the holidays as command performances in which family members are supposed to entertain and gratify the narcissist, you don’t have to go along with that script.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>Cell phones can be handy exit tools. At any point, you can reach into your pocket or bag, remove your phone, and say, “Excuse me, I have a call I have to take” and then leave.</p>
      <p>Nobody can know whether you actually got a call or not or whether it was urgent or not. Take a walk, go to your room or bathroom, do whatever you like.</p>
      <p>When you return, you can say the call was an emergency call from work or a friend, but that everything is okay. Or you don’t have to say anything about who the “call” was from.</p>
      <p>Another approach is to simply agree to disagree. If things get heated, declare a holiday truce. Find distractions as needed, like a game or movie.</p>
      <p>Other lifelines include: texting, emailing, or calling a friend or therapist for moral support; podcasts or reading on <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/assertiveness">assertiveness</a>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/mindfulness">mindfulness</a>, or self-care; and checking schedules for local 12-step meetings or other support groups and attending if desired.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3) Answer questions you want to answer, not necessarily questions you are asked</b>
      </p>
      <p>Most of us value holiday times as opportunities to be open, vulnerable, and share emotionally intimate conversations and experiences. The challenge in doing so with narcissistic people is that they may use your vulnerability against you. Narcissists’ lack of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/empathy">empathy</a> can lead them to ridicule or ride roughshod over others’ tender feelings.</p>
      <p>Narcissists can use questions as verbal fencing, put-downs, or intrusive fishing expeditions seeking sensitive material which they may later use to manipulate you.</p>
      <p>When confronted with a question you don’t want to answer, borrow a page from political spin doctors on cable news talk shows who segue to their talking points no matter what they are asked by moderators.</p>
      <p>For example, if an intrusive family member asks how your spending or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/diet">diet</a> is going, you could redirect the conversation. Marvel about how much more grown-up your nieces and nephews seem. Talk about a local <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sport-and-competition">sports</a> team or recent film or performance you attended.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Another approach is to answer an unwelcome question by subtly shifting to a topic you know the narcissistic person loves to talk about. For example, say something like “I heard you had a great vacation this summer. I’d love to hear what it was like.”</p>
      <p>Or ask them about a hobby. Give them an opportunity to brag or hold court. With narcissists, it doesn’t take much to nudge them back to their favorite topic – themselves.</p>
      <p>While it may not be that fulfilling a conversation, it is a form of potential damage control. It is okay to change the subject. You are under no obligation to answer questions that make you uncomfortable or put you at emotional risk.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4) Build in self-care</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Especially during the holidays, be sure to maintain practices that support you such as healthy eating, exercise and sleep habits.</p>
      <p>Give time to yourself, such as taking a short walk, nap or other self-caring behaviors. While it may be hard to keep a normal routine during the holidays given the emotional tugs (and abundant food and drink), do what you can. You don’t need others' permission to do what is best for you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5) Use interactions with narcissists to grow</b>
      </p>
      <p>Being around narcissists can feel like a series of emotional skirmishes that drain your energy and reduce your sense of self. It is natural in the face of that to fall into a defensive posture, just trying to limit the potential damage or seeking to “just get through it.”</p>
      <p>How about having something bigger at stake than just getting through it? Perhaps there are areas of your life or skills you wish to improve such as assertiveness, having greater peace or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/confidence">self-confidence</a>, not losing your cool, or setting healthy boundaries.</p>
      <p>While it takes work and has risks, there are few people better to learn such skills with than narcissists. Narcissists regularly violate healthy norms for feeling, thinking and relating. If you can set healthy boundaries with people who instinctively distort healthy norms, you can be confident that you will probably be able to set healthy boundaries with practically anybody.</p>
      <p>If something upsetting happens, simply ask yourself, “How can this help me learn and grow?”</p>
      <p>Bottom line: Holidays can be wonderful but stressful. You may have many emotions during the holidays: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness">happiness</a>, boredom, pleasure frustration, comfort, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger">anger</a>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/loneliness">loneliness</a>, joy, sadness, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxiety</a>, and more. Feelings come and go.</p>
      <p>Holidays are times for relaxing and celebrating. They can be a time for connection and renewal. Planning ahead and having realistic expectations can help you connect and rejuvenate rather than disconnect and regress.</p>
