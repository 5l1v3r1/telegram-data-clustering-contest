      <p>It may be possible to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyrobertson/2015/12/22/7-things-running-4000km-taught-me-this-year/">out-run</a> death, at least for a little while, according to a recent study.An international team of researchers analyzed data from 14 previous studies involving a total of 232,149 people who had their health tracked by scientists for at least five years and as long as 35 years. They found that, of the 25,951 individuals who died during this period, those who ran were correlated with a 27 percent lower risk of death than those who didn’t run at all.</p>
      <p>The association was found among both men and women and even when a person went for just one slow jog a week or even less.</p>
      <p>“Any amount of running, even just once a week, is better than no running,” the <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2019/09/25/bjsports-2018-100493">paper published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine</a> concludes.</p>
      <p>Running was also linked to a 30 percent lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease and 23 percent less chance of dying from cancer.</p>
      <p>Even small “doses” of running that come in below the <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults">recommended weekly duration of vigorous physical activity</a> seem to stave off death.</p>
      <p>“Increased rates of participation in running, regardless of its dose, would probably lead to substantial improvements in population health and longevity,” the study reads.</p>
      <p>There’s a lot of questions that the study leaves unanswered, however, like whether or not increasing the dose of running in terms of frequency, effort and duration might also increase the apparent longevity benefits.</p>
      <p>The data didn’t seem to show that lots of running meant lots more days on this planet, but at least <i>some</i> running does appear to be linked to at least a few more days or years of life.</p>
      <p>The researchers themselves caution that the study says nothing about possible causes of the relationship observed between running and longevity and that various methods employed by the studies the team analyzed may muddy the waters a bit.</p>
      <p>“More studies are needed to examine how sustained running behavior, rather than sporadic participation, is associated with mortality risk,” they write. “Future studies should also consider assessing running habits using activity trackers, as these devices may provide more detailed and accurate insights into running behavior.”</p>
