      <h1>Watch: Ireland U19s Fill Their Boots In 13-0 Win Over Gibraltar</h1>

      <p>While the senior squad have struggled to find the back of the net in their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign, the U19 side seem to have no such issues.</p>
      <p>Ireland have performed well at this level in recent times, reaching the semi-final of the European Championships during the summer. While some of the key members of that team have moved on to feature for Stephen Kenny's U21 side, the current crop are now making their mark.</p>
      <p>Tom Mohan's side took on Gibraltar in a Euro qualifier yesterday, and managed to bag a hatful of goals. The game would finish <b>13-0</b>, with Aston Villa's Tyreik Wright bagging four.</p>
      <p>You can watch all of the goals below.</p>

      <p>Not a bad day at the office. Remarkably this was not Gibraltar's heaviest defeat of the week, having shipped 14 goals in a loss to Austria on Thursday.</p>
      <p>For Ireland this was the perfect way to bounce back from the 2-1 loss to Switzerland earlier in the week They took an early lead in that game, before ultimately falling to a 2-1 defeat after having a man sent off around the hour mark.</p>
      <p>They will face Austria on Tuesday in the final game of this phase.</p>
