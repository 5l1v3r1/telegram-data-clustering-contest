      <p>Long Island City-based JetBlue Airways is launching a new spectrum fares this month that includes a basic economy product.The fare changes, which were announced and went into effect on November 12th, add two new fare classes for passengers to select during the booking process: Blue Basic and Blue Extra.</p>
      <p>Blue Extra is built as a premium version of the airline’s typical economy fare. Passengers booking Blue Extra fares get early boarding as well as unlimited cancellations, booking changes, same day changes and standby opportunities. Blue Extra fares will also obviously command a premium price over the traditional Blue and Blue Plus fares, but for those who like to make multiple booking changes or who prefer early boarding, there are well-defined upsides.</p>
      <p>On the other side of the economy fare spectrum, Blue Basic offers little flexibility in terms of change or standby capability – the fares simply strip away that privilege. Basic Blue flyers are also only given one third of the frequent flyer miles that other economy passengers earn, limiting the rate at which those on the fares can earn rewards or elite status. And as a polar opposite to Blue Extra, Blue Basic travelers board last, meaning some of those passengers will inevitably run out of overhead bin space.</p>
      <p>That overhead bin privilege is a good distinction of JetBlue’s basic economy product though. Unlike some of its peers, JetBlue allows Blue Basic passengers to bring one carry-on bag onboard instead of forcing passengers to pay for a checked bag (or rely on an under-seat personal item). Basic Blue also gives the option to at least pay for seating at the time of booking, a functionality that some other carriers don’t permit.</p>
      <p>Despite those small differences, Blue Basic is roughly competitive with the basic economy products that American, Delta and United have rolled out in the last several years. At each particular carrier, one perk is slightly different – say the ability to use overhead bin space at one carrier or the frequent flyer miles earned on another – but in general, the concept of basic economy is the same: offer less flexibility and fewer in-flight amenities in exchange for the cheapest ticket possible.</p>
      <p>As a function of these new fares, JetBlue should now be better positioned to compete with its larger rivals in extracting additional revenue out of the economy cabin. Over the last few years, American, Delta and United have all rolled out highly segmented cabins in which basic economy passengers can pay for services à la carte and deep-pocketed passengers can pay a premium for flexibility and space. That strategy has arguably kept fares low while airlines can still optimize for revenue. Now, JetBlue can also reap some of those rewards.</p>
