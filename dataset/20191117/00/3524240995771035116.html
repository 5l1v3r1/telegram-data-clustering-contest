      <p><b>Nigeria</b> will not be taking part in next year’s men’s football event of the Olympic Games in Japan.</p>
      <p>It is a disappointment that FC Tombov forward,  Olabiran Muyiwa, has accepted and has sought fans’ forgiveness, urging them never to lose their heads.</p>
      <p>The national U-23 side failed to make the last-four at the on-going U-23 AFCON in Egypt after finishing third in Group B on four points behind South Africa and Ivory Coast, who finished on five and six points respectively.</p>
      <p>Imama Amkapabo’s charges needed a win in their last match against the Amaglugglug at the Al Salam stadium, but could only muster a draw. It was a result that put out the defending champions’ Olympic flames.</p>
      <p>Olabiran stated, “It is a disappointment that we couldn’t reach our goal, which was to qualify for the Olympics. We gave everything and fought together, but Allah planned otherwise. We are going to come back stronger and work harder.</p>
      <p>“Let’s put our heads up. We’re Nigerians. I want to thank my teammates and the entire staff for the job done since the qualifiers till now. It is an immense honour to represent the nation.”</p>
