        <b>Matthias Ginter shone in Germany's rout of Belarus, winning him recognition from head coach Joachim Low.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Joachim Low heaped praise on Matthias Ginter</b> following his standout display in Germany's comfortable 4-0 Euro 2020 qualifying victory over Belarus on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Borussia Monchengladbach star <b>Ginter opened his international account</b> with a deft flick at his club side's home stadium and<b> later set up one of Toni Kroos' two goals</b>.</p>
      <p>Still only 25, <b>Ginter is already a veteran of two World Cup campaigns</b> but has taken time to cement a regular spot in Low's plans.</p>
      <p>But after six starts in 2019 and with Niklas Sule sidelined by a long-term knee injury, the 29-cap centre-back looks set to be a big part of his nation's Euro 2020 assault.</p>
      <p>"A lot of people talked about Matthias Ginter during the week. He's a bit underrated," head coach Low said.</p>
      <p>"<b>He's always performed well for the team</b>. I know what to I can expect from him. Ginter is solid and has a very good first ball out of defence.<b> He's also improved defensively and is calm and reliable</b>. You know what to expect, which is important for a coach. He doesn't have a lot of ups and downs. <b>I'm very happy for him that he scored a goal</b>, and such a beautiful one."</p>

      <p>Manuel Neuer did have to keep out a second-half penalty from Igor Stasevich in order to preserve the home side's clean sheet, leaving Low aware of the work that still needs to be done.</p>
      <p>"I congratulated the players on securing qualification â€“ that was our main goal," he said.</p>
      <p>"The team played really well. They combined well with one another. We were slightly sloppy after our third goal and have to be more clinical."</p>
