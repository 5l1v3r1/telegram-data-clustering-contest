        <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/never-binge-again">Never Binge Again</a>
      </p>
      <p>I've been a licensed clinical psychologist for almost three decades and have supervised dozens of therapists, counselors, and coaches. Last week I took a quick break from writing about <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/never-binge-again/201901/how-stop-binge-eating-in-three-unusual-steps">overcoming overeating</a> to write about the experience of what it's been like to <i>be </i>a therapist. I was shocked when the first post on the topic "<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/never-binge-again/201901/how-stop-binge-eating-in-three-unusual-steps">The Single Most Common Question I Get as a Psychologist</a>" became the most popular one on this site for 24+ hours. I've therefore decided to turn this into a series.</p>
      <p>Today I'd like to talk about the single best thing about being a psychologist, in my personal opinion. I'd venture to guess a lot of other mental health professionals will agree.</p>
      <p>When I ask what people think the best thing about being a therapist might be they say things like:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>You must have already worked out <i>everything </i>in your own life by being a therapist for years.</b> <i/>No, sometimes we have <i>more </i>problems as a result of our job, not less. Psychologists also face the same human condition everyone else does, we just have extra tools to make our way through life.</li>
        <li><b>You make a lot of money. </b>Think again! If money is your end goal you'd be better of going into finance. The median earning power for clinical, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/coaching">counseling</a>, and school psychologists as of 2018 was approximately $38/hr according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It's a living, not a fortune!</li>
        <li><b>It's a low <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stress</a> job where you get paid to sit around and talk to people all day</b>. This is something people would never say if they sat in our chair for even one week. Talking to people all day about their most intimate struggles is anything but low stress, because mostly you're not talking, you're listening and absorbing. Moreover, you'd be surprised how many people talk <i>at </i>you, not <i>to </i>you. Perhaps that's why, depending upon which study you look at, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/burnout">burnout</a> rates in mental health are anywhere from a low of 21% to a high of 67%.</li>
        <li><b>Everyone trusts you and treats you with respect</b>. This is largely, but not completely true. Not everyone automatically trusts a psychologist. Beyond this, what most people don't realize is that constantly being immersed with people who trust you is both a blessing and a curse. Yes, trust makes the job easier because you learn what you need to from clients faster, but it can also create a warped perspective which interferes with the rest of your life. For example, when I'm out with a woman for the first time I often find myself asking questions which can be <i>way </i>too deep for a first date. Then I feel shocked when she seems guarded! "Don't you know who I am?" I think. "Can't you see what everyone else sees? That I'm kindhearted to my core? That I will always have your best interest at heart, even if I must sacrifice my own?" I should know better and allow the time and space for trust to develop, but I nevertheless find it difficult to shift gears because of how many people trust me deeply and implicitly. Maybe that's why I'm still a bachelor?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>No, the best thing about being a psychologist is not the money, the deep knowledge about psychological problems, the trust, or just sitting around and schmoozing with people for pay. For me, the <i>best </i>part dates back to something my Dad said when I was only fifteen years old: "Glenn", he said, "if you want to work things out in life get into <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy">therapy</a>, but if you <i>really </i>want to work them out <i>become </i>a therapist!" (Dad has been a clinical psychologist for more than half a century).</p>
      <p>What my father meant was, good psychologists feel a very deep commitment to facing whatever issues our clients need <i>us </i>to face in order to help <i>them</i>. We can't take anyone beyond our own personal limits.</p>
      <p>For example, one of the primary reasons I became good at <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stage-fright">public speaking</a> is because of clients who were terrified of it. When I was initially faced with these types of clients I was pretty terrified of public speaking myself, so I'd refer them to other professionals. But then I had a client whom I really wanted to keep. He was tasked with speaking about a new solution to a serious health problem, and could very well save lives if he could only overcome his <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear">fear</a>. I became determined to help which meant I <i>had to </i>face my own fear. I read everything I could about the topic, then hired a radio publicist who put me on the air with some frequency. Although I'm still far from perfect, I improved dramatically as a consequence, and this skill subsequently supported my own <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/career">career</a> beyond measure.</p>
      <p>As a lay person you can pursue your own personal growth at whatever rate is comfortable for you<i>, </i>but if you want to be a therapist you're obligated to be at least a step or two ahead of your clients. You must grow at <i>their </i>comfort rate, not your own. This can be painful, but it also supercharges your personal growth.</p>
      <p>The public speaking client is only one example, I could give you dozens. Whether it was developing a deeper bond in male friendships when I was frightened of making myself that vulnerable, asking for the sale in business situations (I've had a dual career), bridging rifts in my own family relationships, or even finding creative expression and relief in an oppressive atmosphere, I've had many clients who've pushed me where I'd never have gone myself, at a pace I'd never have taken.</p>
      <p>There are two more things which make being a clinical psychologist <i>great</i>. Things most of the public would never guess.</p>
      <p>The first one is being immersed in very <i>real </i>and intimate conversations on a daily basis. (My sister, a clinical psychologist herself for almost 25 years, pointed this out to me.) In "normal life" people have surface conversations about <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/politics">politics</a>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sport-and-competition">sports</a>, the economy, fashion, soap operas, etc. I'm not saying these things aren't important or real, or that you can't reach deeper meaning by discussing them. At the same time, they also <i>can </i>keep a certain distance between people as they talk about things rather than feelings and connections, and that can make life feel empty.</p>
      <p>Psychologists, on the other hand, are almost always immersed in conversations about the soul. Relationships. Love. Interpersonal conflicts. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/relationships">Intimacy</a>. We live in the "deep end of the pool." While this brings its own set of problems, it's also intensely satisfying, meaningful, and fulfilling.</p>
      <p>The last amazing thing about being a psychologist is inadvertently finding solutions to your own problems in client interactions. Clients are constantly teaching you things without even knowing it!</p>
      <p>For example, I've had to work very hard at being <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/assertiveness">assertive</a> in my own life. It never came naturally. Then I was referred a teenager, let's call her "Jill", who was focused on building a better connection to her father. Just before Father's Day we had this interaction <i>(name and details changed to protect client):</i></p>
      <p>JILL: "Hey doc, what did you get your dad for Father's Day?"</p>
      <p>ME: "Why do you ask? Are you thinking about what to get your Dad?"</p>
      <p>JILL: "I really want to know what you got <i>your </i>Dad!"</p>
      <p>ME: "I'm not sure it's in your best interest for me to answer that. You said you wanted to work on your relationship getting with your dad, and this could be a great opportunity for us to understand it better. So why do you ask?"</p>
      <p>JILL: Folds her arms and says "What did you get <i>your </i>dad!"</p>
      <p>ME: "Jill, why do you ask?"</p>
      <p>CLIENT: "Look doc, I'm going to count to three and if you haven't told me what you got your father by the time I do I'm going to get up off this chair and b-- slap you!" <i>(Said with intensity, but with a giant smile and warm laugh.)</i><br/><br/>On the surface, this encounter taught me it's <i>not </i>always good to play everything by the book as a therapist. You can't be a blank screen with every client, all the time. I eventually gave Jill a partial answer, after which she opened up substantially. But this is <i>not </i>the point I'm trying to make. There was something much subtler Jill taught me in this session, and much more relevant to the discussion at hand. See, the manner and tone in which Jill delivered the "threat" made it clear it was <i>no </i>threat at all. She easily and effortlessly used <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/humor">humor</a> to assert herself and get what she needed from me. Jill was genuinely confused about how to relate to her dad and needed a little guidance to think about how to connect with him in a way she hadn't before. Her creative use of humor to get what she needed was second nature. It flowed from her soul without a second thought.</p>
      <p>This was <i>not </i>something she learned from me or as a result of her therapy. In fact, it would be much more accurate to say I learned it from her. After several such interactions, I found myself naturally using a similar style of humor to be assertive in my own life. It became a part of me and was extraordinarily helpful.</p>
      <p>I did my job with Jill. I helped her with her Dad. But, without knowing it, I'm pretty sure she helped me more.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The best thing about being a clinical psychologist is that it supercharges your own growth. Far and above the money you're paid, the knowledge you acquire, or the status you achieve.</b>
      </p>
      <p>And that's my not-so-humble opinion for what it's worth!</p>
