      <p>"We firmly reject the unfounded remarks reportedly made by the Indian External Affairs Minister (EAM) in an interview with a French newspaper and in interaction with certain other media outlets," read a statement from the press release of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA).</p>
      <p>The foreign office said that it was unfortunate that the BJP-led government continued to manufacture facts with regard to the issue of terrorism and the situation in occupied Kashmir.</p>
      <p>"This outburst is yet another reflection of India’s characteristic hubris and the BJP government's well-known smear campaign against Pakistan," stated the press release.</p>
      <p>The press release responded to the Indian external affairs minister's remarks by stating that Kulbhushan Jadhav was the face of Indian terrorism that was being exported to Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Pakistan said that despite its state-terrorism, the Indian government had failed to suppress the voice of the people of occupied Kashmir who are demanding self-determination, a right which has been granted to them by the United Nations Security Council resolutions.</p>
      <p>The press release condemned India for housing elements that were 'preaching hate and carrying out hate crimes' particularly against its minorities.</p>
      <p>Pakistan called into question India's claims about there being peace in occupied Kashmir, stating that the peace was not visible to the outside world.</p>
      <p>"India would be well-advised to move away from its obsession with Pakistan and also from its continued denial of reality," stated the press release.</p>
      <p>Pakistan said that it would continue to raise the voice and plight of the people of occupied Kashmir and would push for a peaceful resolution to the international Kashmir dispute.</p>
      <p>In an interview, the Indian external affairs minister had asked Pakistan to hand over alleged militants that New Delhi claims Pakistan has if it wants to improve ties with India. </p>
