        <b>England's 2019 vintage drew level with the World Cup winners from 1966 as Harry Kane was once again on target against Kosovo.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/h-kane-120815/">Harry Kane</a> and England wrapped up a prolific 2019 with <b>a 4-0 Euro 2020 qualification win</b> against Kosovo on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Next year, <b>Gareth Southgate</b>'s team will hope to emulate their country's greatest ever side by<b> winning a major tournament at Wembley.</b></p>
      <p>England's current vintage are at least the equal of Alf Ramsey's World Cup winners in one way already – <b>their 38 goals scored in 2019</b> is the same number that the Three Lions managed in <b>a seminal 1966.</b></p>
      <p>Only once, in <b>1909</b>, have England managed more goals in a calendar year, when they <b>scored 39 in just seven games.</b></p>

      <p><b>Kane's individual haul of 12 </b>equalled the record for an England player in a calendar year, standing alongside<b> Everton great Dixie Dean</b>'s efforts in 1927 and George Hilsdon in 1908.</p>
      <p>The <b>Tottenham star has now netted in each of his past six </b>international appearances and is the only England player to do so in the post-war era – matching his own efforts between October 2017 and July 2018.</p>
