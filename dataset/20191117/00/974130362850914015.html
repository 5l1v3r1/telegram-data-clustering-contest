      <h1>'There's Nothing To Do In Kilcoo But Play Football, Go To Mass And Have A Few Sheep'</h1>

      <p>Kilcoo reached their third ever Ulster Club Football Championship final with victory over Fermanagh champions Derrygonnelly Harps at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh.</p>
      <p>The Down team will face Donegal's Naomh Conaill in the decider.</p>
      <p>Centre-back Aaron Branagan, who scored 1-1 as his side won by two points, was named Man of the Match on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>"Me scoring goals, that's a small miracle," Branagan jokingly told RTÃ‰ after the game.</p>
      <p>"We tend to leave it late to push on in games. We know how to get over the line and we know how to dog out games. It was well refereed.</p>
      <p>"That's the way we like it, nice and tough."</p>
      <p>Kilcoo is a small village 15 miles east of Newry.</p>
      <p>"It's absolutely everything," said Branagan when asked what Gaelic football means to his home.</p>
      <blockquote>I was actually talking to a boy this morning. He said, 'There's nothing else to do in Kilcoo but play football, go to mass and have a few sheep'. That's really it.</blockquote>
      <p>Aaron is one of five Branagan brothers on the Kilcoo team which is managed Derryman Mickey Moran.</p>
      <p>"To best honest, they talk more about sheep," Branagan said of his brothers.</p>
      <p>"Football gets a wee bit of talk as well. It's nice to play with your brothers.</p>
      <p>"Mickey is something else. I always say he's like the grandad I never had. He's the best. Everything he says, everybody is totally attentive.</p>
      <p>"He knows what to do, how to get us over the line. He calms us down. There's no shouting."</p>
