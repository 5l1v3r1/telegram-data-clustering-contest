      <h2>The Strictly Come Dancing judge managed to get some words out, but she spoke in German as she was left stunned by Kelvin Fletcher's dance moves</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> judge <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/motsi-mabuse">Motsi Mabuse</a> was left speechless after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kelvin-fletcher">Kelvin Fletcher</a> performed with her younger sister Oti, 29, on tonight's show.</p>
      <p>The pair danced the Jive with a very sexy and steamy routine and Kelvin, 35, managed to impress.</p>
      <p>And as a result, Motsi, 38, was left flushed and began speaking in German as she was completely lost for words.</p>
      <p>When asked by TV host Tess Daly on her thoughts, Motsi couldn't hold it in, and burst out: "He made my life, not my day! Oh my god Kelvin - what was that? I can't believe it."</p>
      <p>The star - who could barely string a sentence together - then added: "I'm speaking German man, you killed me.</p>
      <p>"Well done, that was out of this world!"</p>

      <p>But he didn't just impress Motsi, as Shirley Ballas, 59, had her say too.</p>
      <p>She shouted: "I'm speechless!" adding she didn't know where to start before praising him for performing the routine perfectly.</p>
      <p>Tess also gushed over his incredible performance, saying: "You really did just make Blackpool rock, by the way."</p>

      <p>But if there was one person to ruin it - it would of course be Craig Revel Horwood.</p>
      <p>He said: "I thought the chassés could of been a bit lighter actually," as the audience and judges booed him.</p>
      <p>"I've got some good things to say if you want to hear them," he continued.</p>

      <p>However Craig did approve of the strength and stamina put into their feel-good routine.</p>
