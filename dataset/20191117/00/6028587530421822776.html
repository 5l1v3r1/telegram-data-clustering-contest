      <p>Despite facing tough competition from Dua Lipa, one of the most popular pop stars in the country, Tones and I keeps at No. 1 on the singles ranking once again, as she has a spectacularly successful tune on her hands. The Australian singer-songwriter’s “Dance Monkey” is steady at the top of the tally, earning a seventh stay in the penthouse. According to the <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/tones-and-is-dance-monkey-is-now-the-longest-running-number-1-single-by-a-female-since-leona-lewis-s-bleeding-love__27748/"><i>Official Charts Company</i></a>, hers is now the longest-running No. 1 smash from a solo female since Leona Lewis’ “Bleeding Love,” which took over the world over a decade ago.The top four remains exactly as it was last time around, with Dua Lipa’s “Don’t Start Now” keeping in the runner-up rung (where it debuted), DJ Regard’s “Ride It” holding at No. 3 and Ed Sheeran, Camila Cabello and Cardi B’s “South of the Border” landing at No. 4 once again.</p>
      <p>New to the top 10 entirely is J Hus’ “Must Be,” which debuts at No. 5 this time around. The rapper’s first proper single release in months immediately storms the ranking, becoming his third top 10 and his highest-charting title yet. The song is assumed to be the first sample of an upcoming album.</p>
      <p>Maroon 5’s “Memories” rises to a new high point of No. 6 this week, as the rest of the songs featured inside the top 10 dip, including Post Malone’s “Circles” (No. 7), Selena Gomez’s “Lose You to Love Me” (No. 8), Lizzo’s “Good as Hell” (No. 9) and Lewis Capaldi’s “Bruises” (No. 10). </p>
