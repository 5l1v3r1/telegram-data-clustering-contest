      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended last week just above 28,000 with only three components setting all-time intraday highs: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and United Technologies (UTX). Disney (DIS) set its all-time intraday high on November 13 then consolidated. Walmart (WMT) set an all-time intraday high on November 14 and faded two days later. The only other Dow component to set an all-time high in November was JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which peaked on November 7.</p>
      <p>When I studied the 30 Dow stocks after the Dow closed above 28,000, most components traded lower during the week of November 15. Strength in the Dow is thus not lifting all components.</p>
