      <p>I had the chance to try out Owl Labs' latest video conference tool and was impressed by its power, but it might not be for every remote worker. </p>
      <h3>What Is It?</h3>
      <p>Meeting Owl Pro is a 360° camera, mic, and speaker system, specifically designed for creating a more immersive teleconference experience. It works with Zoom, Sky ype, Google Meet, and other video conference platforms. Plus it looks like and owl and hoots when it comes online. It's definitely got more personality than your basic conference call spider. </p>
      <h3>How Do I Use It?</h3>
      <p>The ease of use is impressive. You plug it in, choose it as your input/output device in your platform of choice and that's it. The Meeting Owl Pro takes care of the rest. </p>
      <h3>Does It Work?</h3>

      <p>In a word, yes. Meeting Owl Pro captures 360 degrees of video and outputs a split screen that focuses on the current speaker, but still shows the other meeting participants. It's extremely effective for those calls where you have a group of people at a conference table or in a huddle. </p>
      <p>Much like how Zoom will highlight or bring focus to the current speaker in a call, Meeting Owl Pro does the same for a physical meeting space. The device is intelligent enough to know who's talking and makes them the center of attention. </p>
      <p>However, it's still keeping an eye on activity on the periphery, where there is motion or faces of other participants, it's keeping those quadrants with activity in the other portions of the screen.  </p>
      <h3>Who's It For? </h3>
      <p>Make no mistake, Owl Labs has made a device that is an incredible upgrade for any company that relies on video conferences, especially where a remote worker is connecting to a physical conference room. Instead of staring at a packed table and trying to figure out who's speaking, Meeting Owl Pro does the work for you. </p>
      <p>And it's better for those in the meeting room as well. Instead of staring at laptop cameras, people are free to look around and chat normally. It's a much better, more organic experience. The height of the Meeting Owl Pro is a little taller than most video conference devices, so that it can see above laptop screens. </p>
      <p>Who it's not for is single remote workers. First off, the $999 price tag is pretty steep for a home office. Unless you're the type of person that likes to walk around while they talk. In which case, there is a case to be made. I found that the Meeting Owl Pro was able to follow me around the room as I paced during a call. A pretty neat trick. But then you're wasting the benefit of the 360 camera, in that you're showing everyone else the walls around your office instead of other conference participants. Ultimately, I found it distracting in my office of one. </p>
      <p>That said, back when I did work in an office, the Meeting Owl Pro would have improved the effectiveness and efficiency of our meetings greatly. There's an inherent disconnect between a table full of coworkers and a handful of remote people on the other end of the line. This helps bridge that gap, making conversation flow and making it easier to see the subtle expression shifts and body chemistry that's often lost when you're not in the room.</p>
      <p>Plus, the eight microphones on the unit normalize volume between speakers, something that's often the bane of any teleconference. </p>
      <h3>Where Can I Get It?</h3>
      <p>Especially if your team is a mix of traditional and remote workers, you should definitely grab a Meeting Owl Pro and check it out for the 30 day trial period. It's an impressive upgrade over traditional meeting devices. </p>
