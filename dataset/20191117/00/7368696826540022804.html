      <p>The controller, which is launching in SA on 15 December 2019 for the retail price of R3,899, is aimed at a hardcore gamepad audience. It is meant to deliver an enhanced gaming experience with a heavy focus on customization. The controller is also the second version in the Xbox Elite Controller series.</p>
      <p>According to the reports, users are complaining about out-of-box issues with the overall design of the controllers. Sticky and unresponsive buttons on the A, B, X, and Y interface are rendering the controller useless. Some users even returned the controller twice in order to get working units. Other users are complaining about connectivity issues over the new integrated BlueTooth feature. Users are having issues connecting to both Xbox One and PC devices.</p>
      <p>As for the analogues, “drifting” is being reported where the thumbsticks register input when the controller is not being used. Reddit now has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/drndrm/elite_controller_series_2_megathread/">dedicated threa</a>d where users have begun reporting on issues they are having with their Xbox Elite Controller Series 2.</p>
