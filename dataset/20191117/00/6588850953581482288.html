      <p>Former Deputy Finance Minister and Member of Parliament for Ajumako-Enyan-Esiam Constituency, Cassiel Ato Forson has chastised the ruling government for 'deceiving' Ghanaians that it has fulfilled all its promises.<br/><br/>Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta while presenting the 2020 budget indicated that the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) has fulfilled all its major campaign promises; citing the implementation of the free senior high school, the one-village-one-dam policy among others.<br/><br/>“<i>Mr Speaker, I am proud to stand here and declare that the President has redeemed virtually all the pledges he made to the people of Ghana. Mr. Speaker, the numbers indeed don’t lie and I have some numbers that make interesting reading. Today, we can be proud of ourselves for the progress we have made together as Ghanaians. This competent Government came into office with a plan. And, we are delivering according to plan. In the President, the people of Ghana are clear on what they voted for: leadership. Strong, assured, decisive, intelligent, focused and compassionate leadership. Election after election, he has been consistent with his vision, focused on his priorities, and unwavering on the path to getting us there. Not even two defeats could shake him away from his convictions”</i> he intimated.<br/><br/>However, Ato Forson disagrees.<br/><br/><i>"instead of apologizing to Ghanaians you are deceiving them that you have fulfilled all your promises. we all know that is not true...when you are in opposition and you are making promises, you should know those you can fulfill and the ones you cannot but if you don't do that you end up making empty promises. Even if you are not able to fulfill your promises, you have to apologize but not Akufo-Addo and his government"</i> he said while talking to Yaa Konama on UTV's Adekye Nsroma, Friday.<br/><br/>Watch video below</p>
