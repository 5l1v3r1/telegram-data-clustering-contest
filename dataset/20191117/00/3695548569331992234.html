        <b>Aleix Espargaro says that Johann Zarco doesn't deserve the factory Honda MotoGP ride he's been linked to and would rather see Alex Marquez join his brother Marc at the team.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jorge Lorenzo's retirement has freed up the second works Honda bike alongside Marquez, with Cal Crutchlow, Zarco and Alex Marquez all emerging as potential candidates.</p>
      <p>Alex Marquez has since become the favourite to get the nod by Honda, with a possible announcement rumoured to be scheduled soon after the Valencia GP season finale.</p>
      <p>Aprilia rider Espargaro agreed that Honda should pick Marquez over Zarco, who "doesn't deserve anything" after showing an 'unprofessional' attitude towards KTM this year.</p>
      <p>Zarco joined the factory KTM team this year but decided to quit the team part-way through the first season of his two-year deal, having struggled to adapt to the bike.</p>
      <p>He then covered for LCR Honda's injured Takaaki Nakagami in the final three races of the calendar, suffering accidents in two of them.</p>
      <p>"Many people say that Zarco deserves that bike, for me that is not true," said Espargaro.</p>
      <p>"For me, if Zarco deserves that bike, [my brother] Pol and me deserve it 10 times more. I think if the Moto2 world champion [Alex Marquez] goes there, more than welcome, and I think he deserves it.</p>

      <p>"[Zarco] doesn't deserve anything. The attitude he showed this year, for me, is not a professional attitude.</p>
      <p>"The people in Aprilia know how many times I cry last year and this year but this is our job and life, a lot of people behind us with a lot of families are working very hard, a lot people are putting a lot of money in the projects.</p>
      <p>"To stop and say 'this bike is s**t, I go home', for me he doesn't deserve to go to the best bike and best team in the world. It is just my opinion."</p>
      <p>Espargaro reckons that the Marquez brothers teaming up would be the best outcome, but doesn't think that he and his brother Pol becoming teammates would be similarly fruitful.</p>
      <p>"I think the situation with Marquez brothers is completely different [to ours], one is the best rider of the history with many titles, Honda is his home.</p>
      <p>"His brother is younger, never been in MotoGP.</p>
      <p>"Pol and me are similar level, similar places with different manufacturers so I think it is better how it is.</p>
      <p>"If at the end Honda decide to take [Alex] Marquez, I think is the best decision, I would do the same because he is the Moto2 world champion.</p>
      <p>"Also, Marc would be happy."</p>
