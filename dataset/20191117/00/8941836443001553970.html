      <h1>LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: There is no legal pot industry</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/the-washington-times/" target="_blank">THE WASHINGTON TIMES</a></address>

        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>I believe that Matthew Adams is a little bit confused (“Congress can fix legal marijuana business banking problem,” Web, Nov. 14). He writes, “Businesses in the legal marijuana industry ” in one sentence and then follows it soon after with ” the federal government still has anti-cannabis laws on the books.” So in point of fact, according to federal law (the Controlled Substances Act), there is no “legal marijuana industry” — despite liberal efforts to confuse the American public on the issue.</p>
      <p>People who are confused enough to believe there is a legal marijuana industry might also be confused enough to believe that there are legal “sanctuary cities.” Didn’t I read somewhere that marijuana use can cause mental confusion? Just sayin’.</p>
