      <p>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) - In a rare public appearance to pick up an award, the woman who accused U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brett-kavanaugh/">Justice Brett Kavanaugh</a> of sexual assault says she had a responsibility to come forward, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nbc-news/">NBC News</a> reports.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christine-blasey-ford/">Christine Blasey Ford</a>, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California, spoke Sunday after she accepted the Rodger Baldwin Courage Award from the ACLU of Southern California in Beverly Hills.</p>
      <p>She said: “When I came forward last September, I did not feel courageous. I was simply doing my duty as a citizen. I understood that not everyone would welcome my information, and I was prepared for a variety of outcomes, including being dismissed.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christine-blasey-ford/">Blasey Ford</a> testified in September 2018 during <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brett-kavanaugh/">Kavanaugh</a>’s confirmation hearings that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brett-kavanaugh/">Kavanaugh</a> assaulted her during a gathering of teenagers in suburban Maryland in 1982.</p>
