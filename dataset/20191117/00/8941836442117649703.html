      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">Paul George</a> made history in his Clippers home debut even though he considered it mere practice after missing the first 11 games of the season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> scored 37 points in 20 minutes, becoming the first NBA player to score that many in fewer than 21 minutes, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles/">Los Angeles</a> led all the way in routing the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-hawks/">Atlanta Hawks</a> 150-101 on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>“He knows I had him on a time limit, so he’s trying to get it all in,” Clippers coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/doc-rivers/">Doc Rivers</a> said.</p>

      <p>It was the Clippers’ largest margin of victory ever and their total points scored were the second-most in franchise history.</p>
      <p>“We had another 30, 40 points that didn’t play tonight,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> said, referring to Kawhi Leonard.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>The anticipated first game with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> and Leonard in the lineup together didn’t happen when Leonard sat out with a left knee contusion.</p>
      <p>But the Clippers didn’t need both of their new superstars on a night when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> tied his career high with six 3-pointers and made all 11 of his free throws.</p>
      <p>“It’s a dream come true to be able to do this at home in front of family and friends,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a>, who is from Palmdale, north of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles/">Los Angeles</a>. “I’m just happy to be playing basketball again.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> was clearly having fun in the fourth when he stole the ball, dribbled down and tossed it off the glass, setting up Montrezl Harrell for a two-handed dunk that ignited the crowd and pushed the Clippers’ lead to 36 points.</p>

        <p>“This is practice for me to get in time with my guys and a catch a rhythm out there,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a>, who spent the first couple weeks of the season rehabbing from offseason shoulder surgeries. “I got new shoulders. They haven’t felt this healthy in a long time.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> started the fourth quarter and hit a 3-pointer, having asked to accumulate more minutes since the team has had little practice time lately.</p>
        <p>But when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> tripped, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/doc-rivers/">Rivers</a> had seen enough and removed him.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t soon enough for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-hawks/">Hawks</a>.</p>
        <p>“You saw a guy step out on the court that had no rust,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-hawks/">Hawks</a> coach Lloyd Pierce said.</p>
        <p>Two nights after scoring 33 in his debut at New Orleans, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> scored 15 of the Clippers’ first 22 points in a six-minute span. They led by 17 and shot 59 percent in the opening quarter.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> is the first player in franchise history to score 30-plus points in his first two games with the team.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-hawks/">Hawks</a> scored 11 straight to close within four early in the second quarter, the closest they would come the rest of the game. The Clippers answered with an 18-6 run, fueled by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a>’s nine points, to go back up by 17 again.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> had 25 points at halftime when the Clippers led 74-62, shooting 52% and making all 16 of their free throws.</p>
        <p>Leonard also sat out on Thursday when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paul-george/">George</a> made his Clippers debut in a loss to the Pelicans.</p>
        <p>Trae Young had 20 points for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-hawks/">Hawks</a>, who dropped their second in a row. They trailed by 52 points in the fourth.</p>
        <p>“It was just bad effort,” Young said, “and you can’t do it in this league or you’ll get killed every night.”</p>
        <p>The Clippers dominated in nearly every category, with their bench outscoring the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-hawks/">Hawks</a>’ reserves 81-35. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles/">Los Angeles</a> made 17 3-pointers and hit 33 of 35 free throws.</p>
