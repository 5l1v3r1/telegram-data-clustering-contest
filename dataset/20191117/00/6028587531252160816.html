      <p>They have been waiting a long time for this. A decade, actually. Pakistanis – such passionate and genuine cricket fans – will finally be able to watch their beloved national Test team in person during a two-Test series against Sri Lanka starting next month. Pakistan has not played at home in cricket’s longest and most revered format – played over five days and limited to 12 nations – since the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-03-03/sri-lanka-cricket-team-bus-attacked-in-pakistan/1608112">horrific terrorist attack</a> on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore in 2009.</p>
      <p>Notably, it is Sri Lanka who will end this decade-long exile. The series starts in Rawalpindi on December 11-15, while the southern city of Karachi will host the second Test from December 19-23. It will be part of the new <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/23526411/all-need-know-2019-21-world-test-championship">World Test Championship</a> and hopes are high this will kick-start regular Test matches in Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Pakistan is scheduled to host Bangladesh in January and South Africa 12 months later for two Tests each. But it is unknown yet whether those series will be played in Pakistan.</p>
      <p>"This is fabulous news for Pakistan and its reputation of being as safe and secure as any other country in the world," PCB's director of international cricket Zakir Khan said of the Sri Lankan tour.</p>
      <p>The Test series appeared in grave doubt after Sri Lanka’s governing body initially was reluctant about the limited-overs tour in September-October due to receiving a warning "of a possible terrorist threat" to its team.</p>
      <p>The tour went ahead but without 10 frontline Sri Lankan players who withdrew citing security concerns. The tour, however, went smoothly with the Sri Lankan contingent given presidential-level security over the course of the entire series.</p>

      <p>Similar safety measures were granted previously for limited-overs tours involving Zimbabwe, the West Indies and a World XI team, along with matches in Pakistan for its domestic Twenty20 franchise competition – the Pakistan Super League (PSL). After mostly being held in the UAE in its first few seasons, the PSL will be entirely based in Pakistan next year.</p>
      <p>With such an impressive track record, Sri Lanka Cricket was convinced of the appropriate safety measures for a Test series and wanted to play a role in the triumphant return of longform cricket in Pakistan.</p>
      <p>"We are pleased to confirm our return visit to Pakistan as, based on our earlier visit, we are comfortable and convinced conditions are suitable and conducive for Test cricket," Sri Lankan Cricket chief executive Ashley de Silva .</p>
      <p>"We also believe all cricket-playing countries should host international cricket at home and in this relation we are happy to play our part in complete resumption of international cricket in Pakistan."</p>

      <p>It’s taken many years – unsurprising after the hellish Sri Lankan attack – but momentum has built quickly since Pakistan’s homecoming in 2015 during a brief ODI series against Zimbabwe. Returning Pakistan home full-time will be a major tonic for cricket.</p>
      <p>An entire generation of players have not played Test cricket – or any form of cricket in some cases – in Pakistan, which holds a treasure trove of indelible images.</p>
      <p>It has been a travesty that so many great players have been unable to be tested in the challenging conditions of Pakistan. For example, recently retired England great Alastair Cook, who played 161 Tests, never played in Pakistan with his Test debut being just three months after England’s last tour there. It is entirely possible great players such as Steve Smith and Joe Root will similarly never play there.</p>
      <p>Powerhouse nations Australia (last toured 1998), England (2005) and (India 2006) remain reticent although Australia and England have recently left the door ajar of <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/roberts-to-visit-pakistan-as-pcb-push-for-australia-tour-grows-20190701-p5235a.html">possibly touring</a> in 2022.</p>
      <p>India and Pakistan, of course, are <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/06/its-not-just-cricket-india-vs-pakistan-is-the-greatest-rivalry-in-world-sport/">at loggerheads</a> and have not played a Test series against each other in over a decade. It does not appear that drought will end any time soon as cricket’s most bitter rivalry remains sadly confined to official ICC tournaments.</p>
      <p>Even though it is <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/we-lost-200-million-due-to-india-not-touring-pakistan-pakistan-cricket-board/articleshow/57128500.cms?from=mdr">financially crippling</a> for Pakistan being unable to play its neighbor, returning home is much-needed after mostly playing in the UAE where they built up a formidable record on field but an expensive bill off it.</p>
      <p>Based in the expensive Gulf region has been a financial drain on the PCB, which has lost about <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2018/05/19/pakistan-cricket-desperate-enjoy-comforts-home-10-years-exile/">$100 million</a> from not playing at home in the past decade.</p>

      <p>Aesthetically, it always felt jarring watching matches played in almost empty stadiums in the UAE. You could hear the reverberations of bat striking ball such the emptiness. Some might say the eeriness was entirely depressing.</p>
      <p>Test matches in the UAE, in contrast to T20 games, attract low crowds which is partly attributed to thousands of guest workers – many of whom are passionate cricket fans from Pakistan – being unable to attend matches played during the day.</p>
      <p>It’s been a grueling decade for Pakistan - such a lovable and richly entertaining cricket team. The sport has been undeniably poorer for Pakistan being forced into a nomadic existence. Testament to its resiliency and enviable talent pool, Pakistan has been able to endure and its fans remain completely dedicated. Perhaps weary, but absolutely loyal.  </p>
      <p>There is light at the end of the tunnel and cricket-starved Pakistanis are starting to feel giddy.</p>
      <p>When the first Test in Rawalpindi gets underway, a nation will humbly cherish watching the game it absolutely adores.</p>
