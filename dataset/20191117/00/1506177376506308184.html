      <p>Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is in London cheering on 21-year-old tennis star Stefanos Tsitsipas, who will be facing Dominic Thiem in the final of the ATP Finals in London on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas beat Roger Federer in the semi-final 6-3, 6-4, earning him a well-earned place in the final and PM Mitsotakis was in the crowd supporting Greece’s young tennis sensation, posting a photo after Tsitspas’ win saying, “a very important athlete is making all of Greece proud.”</p>

      <p>Stefanos who couldn’t wipe the smile off his face after beating Federer also took to social media publishing a photo of himself with the Greek PM in the change room after the game saying, “My road is long with good company.”</p>
      <p>If Tsitsipas wins the title, he will be the youngest champion at the season finale since 20-year-old Lleyton Hewitt from Australia won in 2001. The talented Greek player would become the sixth-youngest champion in the tournament’s 50-year history. John McEnroe holds the record for the youngest champion, lifting the trophy in 1978 when he was 19.</p>
      <p>“I remember myself being one of these kids here, watching the event, and for me, it was just, I could never picture myself standing here,” said Tsitsipas.</p>
      <p>“But it did happen. Dreams do come true.”</p>
      <p>Best of luck Stefanos!</p>
