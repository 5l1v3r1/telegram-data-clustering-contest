      <p>Food and sadness are old friends. Many of us turn to food for comfort, or offer food to our children when they're sad. This idea of comfort food is all around us. Books, magazine articles, films are constantly referring to our need for comfort foods. We see recipes for comfort foods on the front covers of national magazines.</p>
      <p>There is nothing wrong with comfort food on occasions when we need extra care, like a death in the family, the loss of a job, recovering from <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/trauma">trauma</a>, or just having a really bad day at work. But "on occasion" means just that, a one-time event that happens infrequently.</p>
      <p>When we eat comfort foods every day we suffer from under-<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/diet">nutrition</a>. Our bodies are not wired to eat heavily processed foods. And when we turn to comfort food every day for comfort we will begin to feel sick, and maybe even sadder. The comfort food may feel good while we are eating it, but within an hour or two we may start to feel ill. Can you think of a time this happened to you? To your child?</p>
      <p>How do we stop the cycle of using food for comfort or offering food as comfort to our children? One way is to take a few minutes to understand your feelings, or your child’s feelings. Ask yourself, or your child—what is hurting? Is your heart hurting because someone said an unkind thing? Is your spirit hurting because you feel lonely? What needs comfort? Then try to find another way to provide comfort. Would a hug help? Would a movie help? Would a trip to the playground help? And for you, what would help comfort you when you feel lonely, or tired, or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stressed</a>?</p>
      <p>Finding new ways to comfort ourselves is like a surprise gift. As we find new ways to comfort ourselves, like taking a long walk, or calling an old friend just to chat, our brain will connect the new way of comforting and reward us by feeling less stress and hopefully, comfort. We don’t need to find big things to comfort us. Small things work best. Maybe we give our child a special stone, or necklace to remind them of your love and support. Maybe we listen to a song that uplifts us and sparks joy in us. One of many ways we caregivers can help our children is to feel worthy of comfort ourselves first. We know that children learn from the things we say and do consistently.</p>
