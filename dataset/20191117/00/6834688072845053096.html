      <p>Less than two years after raising £727,820 through its first <a href="https://www.seedrs.com/we-build-bots">Seedrs campaign</a>, We Build Bots (<a href="http://intelagent.ai/">IntelAgent</a>) has returned to the <a href="https://www.seedrs.com/webuildbots1">equity crowdfunding platform</a> and has already successfully secured its initial 250,000 funding target. The company is currently offering 7.64% in equity at a £3,021,340 pre-money valuation.</p>
      <p>As previously reported, We Build Bots has built AI-powered ChatBot platforms for customer service departments by using sentiment analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing so that companies may automate.</p>
      <blockquote>“Our cloud based analytics dashboard reports key metrics like agent utilisation, first contact resolution, average speed of resolution, chat abandonment rate, customer satisfaction, conversation quality analysis and agent occupancy so clients have complete visibility and control across the contact centre. It also reports on the overall emotion and satisfaction of your customers day by day.”</blockquote>
      <p>We Build Bots also describes itself as a GovTech company, creating multi-award winning, AI-Powered automation software for the public sector. The company noted:</p>
      <blockquote>“Our core product, IntelAgent, is a cloud-based customer service platform combining bots, voice, AI, and analytics to help the public sector deliver better, faster, more efficient, customer care, and leverage the data they collect. GovTech is changing the way local and central governments engage with citizens. Increasingly, younger, smaller, entrepreneurial startups like us are disrupting the traditional models for delivering public services, offering more agility, creativity and innovation than traditional suppliers.”</blockquote>
      <p>We Build Bots then revealed the investment round’s funds will act as a “bridge round” to its Series A funding round, which will take place in 2020. The funds will be used for the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 new developers.</li>
        <li>1 new sales.</li>
        <li>1 Business Analyst.</li>
        <li>Legal and deal fees for raise (plus contingency).</li>
        <li>Increase marketing, esp live events and PR to complement digital activities.</li>
      </ul>
