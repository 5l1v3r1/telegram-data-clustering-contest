      <p>Jack Beckman didn’t win the ultimate prize – a second NHRA Mello Yello Funny car championship – falling eight points shy of Robert Hight’s final total, but he’ll walk off into the Pomona sunset with the final Wally of the Funny Car season after a truly weird final round.</p>
      <p>Hight needed only to keep his Auto Club Chevy in its lane – win or lose – in the final round to avoid a centerline points violation. He decided to celebrate what was expected to be a carefree run by doing a half-track burnout, only to have the engine die at the end. Beckman took a careful solo down the right lane to lock up the event title. he finished second behind Hight in points, just eight markers back; in 2012, he lost the title by just two points to Ron Capps.</p>
      <p>Beckman’s Infinite Hero Dodge was a rock throughout eliminations, posting a 3.946 in the first round to defeat John Hale then a 3.958 to end 2018 season champ J.R. Todd’s reign.</p>
      <p>Upset-minded Blake Alexander, who had worked his way past Bob Tasca III and rookie Steven Densham, then powered to a 3.956 to reach the final round against Hight.</p>
      <p>Hight had opened his Sunday account by beating his boss, John Force, in the opening round, ending Force’s slim hopes for a 17th season title with a 3.94, then bested Shawn Langdon, in what is expected to be Langdon’s last Funny Car ride before returning to Top Fuel next season, with a 3.97.</p>
      <p>In a crucial match with fellow title contender Matt Hagan, Hight took the win in convincing fashion, 3.97 to 4.07 to lock up the championship</p>
