      <h1>A Transformative Hotel In Mauritius</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jeanine Barone</a></address>
      <p>Set along the languid and less developed east coast of Mauritius, <a href="https://www.saltresorts.com/en/mauritius/hotel/saltofpalmar">SALT of Palmar </a>is on a mission: to provide guests with a truly transformative experience. Sure, most people return from just about any vacation feeling refreshed and relaxed. But the 59-room SALT of Palmar has an ambitious philosophy, going far beyond that of other resorts. This is no typical guidebook experience. It revolves around connectedness — connectivity that transcends mere social media, though the resort is plenty Instagram worthy — and sustainability, which imbues every aspect of the resort and the guest experience because, after all, the only way to transform is to lead by example. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>This is the first eco hotel in Mauritius. The hope is that guests will return home more aware of the intimacies of this island: its traditions and stories; its flavors and crafts through first-hand experiences with the passionate locals, whether resort team (staff) members, or the SALT Shakers, local makers who furnish the hotel with everything from beach baskets to ceramic dishware. The hope is also that guests will bring home with them a greater awareness of how small steps taken in daily life can go a long way to protecting the environment. SALT intends to bring their transformational approach beyond the boundaries of the resort to the surrounding communities.</p>

      <p>The engagement factor is profound at SALT of Palmar. All of the team members, including those involved in meals, cocktails, sports or other activities, know the guests’ likes and dislikes, no matter how small; that I, for example, prefer almond lattes, entrees in small portion sizes, and no fiery hot foods. The staff members are genuinely interested in the guest’s well-being, always asking if you are having a good day, if everything is going well, and whether you are enjoying yourself. One of the wait staff, for example, knowing I love jackfruit, provided jackfruit factoids, including telling me that when it’s ripe you can eat it like ice cream. This kind of care was apparent multiple times each day during my stay. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Though the term “sustainable” and “eco-friendly” may connote, to some people, brown, basic, and boring, SALT created something that’s stylish, vibrant, contemporary and chock full of surprises, but without an ounce of pretension. </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The transformative experience begins at the untraditional check-in where there is no reception desk. Instead, guests hang out on a teal cushioned couch with black and white striped roll pillows in a captivating open space, interacting with staff and other guests. Team members greet you with “Welcome home.” </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Don’t expect to receive a room key, given that SALT has a no-plastics policy. Instead, you download the SALT app that provides room access. But the app is much more, giving you the opportunity to book experiences, review menus, make spa appointments, and message a team member, to name a few. </p>

      <p>After filling in your personal information on a tablet, a team member escorts you through the vibrantly painted—courtyard with its serene pool, and out the back door to the sand where a set of shaded bean bag cushions awaits. Here, the team member leads you through a short mindful meditation session that begins and ends with them tapping a glass triangle, producing a high-pitched clinking sound that reverberates through the warm air. </p>

        <b>ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mauritian architect, Jean Francois Adam, along with the design team of French artist, Camille Walala, and her collaborator, Julia Jomaa, transformed a former hotel occupying a riad-style complex into a playfully-painted small resort. The whimsy quotient is high, where black and white stripes readily mix with a rainbow of striking hues and seemingly disparate patterns. In fact, this design diversity is reflective of Mauritius itself with its melting pot of cultures and cuisine, as well as its colorfully-painted homes.</p>
      <p>Green plants are all about, on trellises, growing up through a long communal table in the restaurant, beside the pool, and piercing the wooden deck of the Beach Bar, one of three delightful bars that suit all tastes, literally.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>GUEST ROOMS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unlike the rest of the resort that’s brilliantly painted, there’s no abundance of color in the guest rooms where white predominates, both on the walls and the bedding (500 thread-count sheets). The only brilliant colors come from the throw pillows, seating cushions, dresser, bedside table, and the tiled walls of the open rain shower. There’s no need for decorative features hung on the walls when you have floor-to-ceiling windows, and a balcony providing stunning views of the sun, sky and sea. The top-of-the-line room category is the Best on Beach, the largest with the biggest balcony. But, the next best category, Bang on Beach, though smaller, is plenty large. </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Because everything at SALT of Palmar is unexpected (in a good way), there’s no mini-bar with cookie-cutter type items. Instead, a dresser drawer reveals mason jars filled with homemade coconut flakes and taro chips, as well as Moringa tea, decaf coffee, regular coffee, black tea, and raw sugar. The ceramic coffee cups, like much of the minimalist dishware on property, are made by Janine Espitalier-Noel, the talented local potter who’s a SALT Shaker. A take-home aluminum water bottle is emblazoned with the environmental evils of plastics, proclaiming how eight million tons of plastics are dumped in the sea every year is destroying marine life.</p>
      <p>Don’t expect pre-packaged chocolates as part of the turn-down service. Instead, you’ll be delighted to find freshly-made cookies or chocolate truffles placed under glass atop a wooden palette.  </p>

      <p>
        <b>GUEST ROOM AMENITIES</b>
      </p>
      <p>The closet holds a yoga mat and a yoga block for the numerous yoga activities offered on property as well as a beach tote bag woven from recycled plastic by a local family who has been doing this for generations. Even the flip-flop sandals are unique: made from sedge (great for a reflexology stimulus), and impregnated with cinnamon bark powder to banish odor. </p>
      <p>One of the most coveted items: the ultra-soft bathrobes hanging in the bathroom area. These are 100% organic, fashioned from unbleached cotton along with the waste from coffee beans. Also much loved are the unbelievably soft (500 thread-count) bath towels. Even the bath mat softly snuggles your feet, and doesn’t slip. (They’ve thought of everything.)</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dd009ebea103f00065291cb/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>Eco Friendly amenities<cite>SALT of Palmar</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>All of the amenities are environmentally wholesome: cotton pads and “Q tips” made of 100% organic cotton and bamboo, and packaged in biodegradable (crushed limestone) paper pouches; a shower cap and sanitary bag created from corn starch; a loofah crafted of bamboo; and soap-on-a-rope handmade by Nathalie Marot, the soap maker who is a SALT Shaker. </p>
      <p>Bulk ceramic containers on the sink and in the shower hold hand wash, hand lotion, body lotion, sunscreen, hair mask, shampoo, conditioner, salt scrub, and body wash, all natural, locally-made and paraben-free. </p>
      <p>
        <b>POOL AND BEACH</b>
      </p>
      <p>The stunning lap pool facing the sand and the placid coral reef-protected lagoon is the centerpiece of the resort. Here, lounge chairs shaded by black and white umbrellas hold canary yellow beach bowels. Behind them are comfy teal-hued daybeds rimmed in black and white stripes. </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Daybeds<cite>Jeanine Barone</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Steps away are the soft white sands of an often breezy (on the east end) beach that’s peppered with pines, as well as yellow, indigo and white bean bags to sit or recline on, as well as lounge chairs, some shaded by thatch umbrellas made of sugarcane leaves. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dd00e502c886a0007ec4d67/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>Thatch-type beach umbrellas<cite>Jeanine Barone</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The lagoon is so shallow that you can easily walk out to several finger-like “jetties” formed naturally from volcanic rocks. You may see locals fishing on the longest one, and guests clamoring on this one and the others, often taking selfies. </p>
      <p>Near the beach and pool areas are two water stations where you can fill your aluminum water bottle with either purified still or sparkling water on tap. And for some refreshing flavor, add pre-cut slices of cucumbers or oranges.</p>
      <p>
        <b>BAKERY</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m a pastry snob, rarely ever finding a baked good that I fancy. They’re either too dry, too sugary, too soft or too hard, too buttery, on and on. But sampling the cornucopia of freshly made pastries — I sampled many — available each morning at SALT’s bakery made me ecstatic. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dd0138dea103f00065291fe/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>Bakery<cite>Jeanine Barone</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The pastries, which are ever changing, are perfect in every way: moist, fluffy, not cloyingly sweet nor overly laden with butter, except where necessary, such as in the heavenly, plump croissants. Aside from myriad croissants, among the array of baked goods are pistachio muffins, tropical rolls, coconut, banana or papaya danishes, a chocolate torsade, and lemon or orange cake cakes. </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Pastries<cite>Jeanine Barone</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>On a butcher block table are a large selection of breads that change daily. These may include pain des amis, the signature bread of the French baker Christophe Vasseur, who trained the staff; multigrain made with sunflower/pumpkin/sesame seeds; dried papaya and coconut; sweet potato; and pineapple raisin bread.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DINING </b>
      </p>
      <p>The airy dining space is expansive, allowing guests to sit in any of a variety of sections and in different manners, whether at a table for two with banquette seating, at a communal table where you can interact with others, on a curvy long sofa or an ottoman in the Pool Bar, or outside beside the swimming pool. </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The back of the menu is emblazoned with a map of the island, indicating who sourced what ingredient. For example, Ricardo supplies oysters, sea urchin and lobsters. Soobiraj is a palm heart grower. Sibi and Asok have a family plantation for seasonal fruit. And Guillanone supplies wild boar, lamb and game from hunting. </p>
      <p>The dishes are a mix of cuisines, just like Mauritius, including African, French, Chinese, Indian, and Creole, plus an abundance of vegetarian, even vegan, dishes. The ingredients are mostly locally-sourced, seasonal (whatever is available from the fisherman and the farmer), and wholesome.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Breakfast:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Beyond scrumptious pastries, they’ve got something for everyone, whether you desire eggs, meats, vegan dishes, or juices. Not only are the choices healthy but they are also oh-so creative: </p>

        <b>BARS</b>
      </p>
      <p>SALT of Palmar is home to three bars, each located in a different venue, and each providing a distinctive experience, complete with their own cocktail menus, where every cocktail has a story. The idea is that by choosing a drink you discover Mauritius.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Pool Bar:</b>

      </figure>
      <p>Cocktails at the Pool Bar include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Midnight Moon blends gin, ylang ylang essence, midnight jasmine honey, cucumber juice and tonic. The story: In the foothills of Lion Mountain is Vallee de Ylang Ylang specializing in ylang ylang flower cultivation. On the owner’s porch is a midnight jasmine flower that releases its fragrance at night, especially when the moon is full. </li>
        <li>Meet Me Under the Calamondin Tree contains citrus rum, calamondin sorbet, pink peppercorn syrup, and popcap sparkling wine. The story: Labourdonnais (home to the family-owned Château de Labourdonnais) is the only area of Mauritius that grows Calamondin fruit used to make jams, flavored rums, and a unique sorbet found only at SALT. The 19th century Chateau is noted for its distillery (the smallest on the island and one that’s surrounded by exotic fruit trees), that makes fine rums.  </li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Beach Bar:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Blue is the beach bar where some element of each cocktail or its story relates to the sea, such as a frozen cocktail, a cocktail with Spirulina, and another that’s blue in color.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Cocktails at the Beach Bar include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clowning Around is made with gin, ginger sorbet, lime leaf syrup, and lemongrass syrup. The story: Mauritian coral, which breeds a large array of marine life, including clownfish, has created a reef that stretches 93 miles around the island. </li>
        <li>        The Dusk Til Dawn cocktail is created by mixing coconut rum with champagne sorbet, coconut water, and Victorian pineapple. The story: An expansive villa on the Ile des Deux Cocos was built by Governor Henry Hesketh Bell, who was renowned for his lavish weekend parties that lasted from dusk on Friday until dawn on Monday. When this Governor’s flag was flying, no one else but the Governor and his party were allowed on the island. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Rooftop Bar:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Clouds is the first rooftop bar in Mauritius. Here, the cocktail menu relies on ingredients that grow up on high: on the hills and mountains.</p>

Le Pouce, also referred to as the thumb peak because it appears as if someone is giving a thumbs up, is the third tallest peak in Mauritius; Darwin was the first person to conquer it. Many endemic flowers grow on its slopes.</li>
        <li>        The Black River Runs Red is created by blending gin with longan juice, cranberry shrub, patchouli essential oil, and hibiscus. The region with its black volcanic rocks is noted for tumbling waterfalls and hiking routes in the Black River Gorge. Hundreds of flowering plants grow here, including rare orchids and hibiscus.</li>

        <b>SPA</b>
      </p>
      <p>One overarching and unusual feature of the SALT Equilibrium Spa is that guests don’t book specific treatments. Rather, they choose the length of their spa time, anything from 30 to 90 minutes. After that, everything is customized for you: the amount of pressure you want, the area of your body you prefer worked on, and your choice of product and essential oil. </p>
      <p>Five different kinds of salt are available: fleur de’sel, Dead Sea salt, Himalayan salt, lava rock salt, and Epsom salt. Different essential oils include lemongrass and juniper berry, my favorite. And, depending on the treatment, there’s a choice of five different products: aloe vera gel, or marine mud for sunburn, though marine mud is also used for a revitalizing rub. The body scrub relies on salt and sugar. Or, if you get a massage, an emollient balm and the blended massage balm with vitamin E and shea butter are used. </p>
      <p>Each session starts with a salt foot soak and ends in the salt room with salt block wall with colors that ever so slowly change. </p>
      <p> </p>

        <b>ACTIVITIES</b>
      </p>
      <p>For some people, relaxing means not doing much of anything. That would be a shame, considering the vast array of experiences offered at SALT of Palmar, many involving an interacting with team members and SALT Shakers. The most unique is their Skill Swap initiative. The idea is that you can sign up to learn or teach a skill. Passionate team members or SALT Shakers teach everything from pottery and fishing to rattan weaving, palm heart farming, and soap making. Guests can also share their own skills, talents or knowledge, whether it’s painting, photography or soccer coaching, with other guests, team members, SALT Shakers or community residents.</p>

        <b>CHECK-OUT</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dropping off a key clearly isn’t part of the check-out process. Instead, a team member leads you back to where your transformative journey first started. During the departure meditation, I’m prompted to think of my experience here, the friends I made, and the journey home as a small amount of salt is placed in my palm. I can then throw the salt into the sea or a large bowl beside me. “What you give away comes back to you. Now your transformation is complete,” the team member says. </p>
