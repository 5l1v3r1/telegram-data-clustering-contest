        <b>Daniele Bonera described how there is "never much time" at AC Milan, where Marco Giampaolo was given just seven games as coach.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Marco Giampaolo needed more time to have a genuine chance</b> of implementing his plans for <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/milan/">AC Milan</a>, according to assistant coach Daniele Bonera.</p>
      <p>Milan sacked Giampaolo following a 2-1 win over Genoa in October, his seventh match in charge. The former Sampdoria boss <b>presided over three victories and four defeats</b> before the Rossoneri rushed to appoint Stefano Pioli – a move that, so far, has failed to lead to an upturn in the team's fortunes. Pioli has led the team to four points from five games since his arrival,<b> with their solitary triumph coming at home</b> to lowly SPAL.</p>

      <p>"In a few months, <b>two coaches arrived with different working methods</b>, two ways of thinking on a defensive level," Bonera, an assistant under both coaches, told La Gazzetta dello Sport. "With Giampaolo, <b>we thought more about the ball.</b> With Pioli, we are more practical and we work on the positioning of players. Giampaolo did not have the time he needed, but at a club like Milan there is never much time."</p>
      <p>Asked about the players, Bonera said: "<b>I see guys who are very committed</b>. Many are really young, in their twenties. It takes time. <b>We need patience, which is a rare commodity in football</b>. We are trying to do better every day. I've never seen any of the players holding back because of fatigue."</p>
      <p>Milan's problems could grow further if Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain launch a January bid to sign goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma,<b> as has been rumoured in recent days</b>. Bonera, who made over 150 Serie A appearances for Milan during his nine-year spell with the club as a player, recommends the 20-year-old Donnarumma remains with his boyhood club.</p>
      <p>"<b>As a fan and someone in love with Milan</b>, I would recommend he stay with us," Bonera said. "But he has staff and family who advise him."</p>
