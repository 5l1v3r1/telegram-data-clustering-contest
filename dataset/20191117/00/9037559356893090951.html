      <p>Former Pakistan cricket team captain Mohammad Hafeez has questioned whether the judiciary's decision to allow PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif to travel abroad is a tacit admission that Pakistan lacks proper medical care.</p>
      <p>The veteran all-rounder, on his official Twitter account, deviated out of sports and shared his views on the Lahore High Court's (LHC) decision to allow former prime minister Nawaz Sharif to travel abroad for medical treatment.</p>
      <p>The man named Professor, famous for his musings and thoughtful takes,  superficially appeared to appreciate the news but his tweet actually had multiple levels to it. </p>
      <p>The tweet said: "Great news Ex PM Nawaz sharif sb can travel to abroad for medical treatment."</p>
