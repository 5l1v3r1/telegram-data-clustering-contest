      <p>An amalgam of several sports, including field hockey and lacrosse, hurling traces its history back thousands of years but is largely unfamiliar to Americans, despite enjoying widespread popularity in Ireland.</p>
      <p>Even so, Saturday’s New York Hurling Classic found a welcoming audience at the home of Major League Baseball’s New York Mets, which has played host to events ranging from cricket to Lady Gaga.</p>
      <p>“To come to a venue like this and to see teams from Ireland come and play ... is really quite an honor,” said Kathleen O’Donnell, a first generation Irish-American from White Plains, New York.</p>
      <p>“It just really puts the sport on the map in a way maybe for an American consciousness.”</p>
      <p>The New York Hurling Classic, hosted by the Gaelic Athletic Association, saw Kilkenny get revenge on Tipperary in a rematch of this year’s All-Ireland final, before fending off Limerick to claim the top prize in a Queens debut steeped in meaning for many of the 11,214 fans in attendance.</p>
      <p>Played on a smaller-than-usual pitch more suited to summer baseball, with modified scoring and 11 men per side instead of 15, the tournament nonetheless delivered high-caliber action.</p>
      <p>“When you’re Irish, you just love everything Irish,” said Michael Kenny, a Tipperary fan whose grandfather played for the team before emigrating to America in 1929.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there will ever be an Irish hurling league in the United States but special event like this in the United States will always be amazing.”</p>
      <p>Limerick manager John Kiely called the competition “once-in-a-lifetime stuff.”</p>
      <p>“An awful lot of American, second generation Irish, if you like, that are playing the game here that have never been to Ireland, never been to see a game of hurling in Ireland,” said Kiely. “It means an awful lot to those people.”</p>
      <p>Kilkenny goalkeeper Eoin Murphy, who put on a defensive masterclass to keep at bay upstart Limerick, said competing in front of Irish expats abroad has special meaning.</p>
      <p>“It’s great to come to cities like this, Boston, New York and to have such a strong Irish connection,” said Murphy.</p>
      <p>“I had two brothers living in Sydney, I have a sister living in London, so you sort of know how much home means to people.”</p>
