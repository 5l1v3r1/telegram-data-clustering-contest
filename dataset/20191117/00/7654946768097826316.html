      <p>Rutgers’ football should take any victories it can get right now – even the moral ones.</p>
      <p>The Scarlet Knights didn’t beat No. 2 Ohio State on Saturday in Piscataway, but they didn’t let the Buckeyes cover the enormous 53-point spread going in the game as Rutgers lost 56-21.</p>
      <p>The 21 points nearly matched the 24 total Rutgers put up in their previous six Big Ten games combined. The majority of those points came in the second half with Ohio State quarterback and Heisman Trophy contender Justin Fields on the bench.</p>
      <p>Rutgers <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/10/rutgers-opens-as-comically-huge-underdogs-against-ohio-state/">opened as 50 ½-point underdogs,</a> which at the time was the largest spread involving Rutgers over the past 22 years. The previous high was 44 against Miami in 2001.</p>
