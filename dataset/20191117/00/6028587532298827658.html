      <h1>IRS Suggests Criminal Referrals To Be Made In Abusive 831(b) Captive Tax Shelter Cases</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Adkisson</a></address>
      <p>According to an article written by Aysha Bagchi on November 18, 2019, in Bloomberg's Tax Management Weekly Reportâ„¢, the IRS Commissioner of the Small Business/Self-Employed Division, Mr. Eric Hylton, stated at the November 14, 2019, AICPA conference that the IRS is looking into making referrals of some 831(b) captive insurance cases to its Criminal Investigations office.The article goes on to quote Mr. Hylton as saying, "Micro-captives is another area in which we want to think about are there some fraud cases that we want to send over to CI, some quality fraud cases?"</p>
      <p>This dovetails with some of my own sources either within or very close to the IRS, which have suggested that the IRS is looking to find the rise case to refer to the U.S. Department of Justice's Tax Division to make an example so as to finally discourage the promotion of abusive 831(b) captives arrangements as tax shelters.</p>
      <p>Part of the IRS's <i>modus operandi</i> in shutting down tax shelters is to do exactly that: Make an example of somebody as a deterrence to others. The IRS did this during the last end-of-the-year tax shelter season, when it <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayadkisson/2018/12/20/doj-sues-to-shut-down-syndicated-conservation-easement-tax-shelter-promoters/">persuaded DOJ-TAX to sue to shut down one of the largest promoters of pre-packaged conservation easement deals</a>. That the IRS would seek to do something similar with 831(b) captive shelters would simply be consistent with how the IRS operates.</p>
      <p>But who? I haven't heard any specific names mentioned (nor would expect to), and my OUIJA board hasn't given any answers yet. However, here is what I suspect the IRS would target for purposes of an injunction.</p>
      <p>First, they would go after a promoter (read: captive manager) who was both subject to a promoter examination and continued to aggressively market and sell 831(b) captives as a tax shelter (even if just wink, wink, nod, nod) after <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayadkisson/2016/11/08/irs-notice-2016-66-regarding-831b-captive-insurance-companies-interpreted-in-common-english/">Notice 2016-66</a> was released, after a number of their clients were assessed in an audit, and even continue to aggressively market now. Which is nearly all of them, although a captive manager who has a client that has a lost a case before the U.S. Tax Court is probably much closer to the bullseye.</p>
      <p>Second, they would go after an actuary or an actuarial firm which facilitated the sale of abusive 831(b) captives by providing actuarial studies that made unsupportable predictions about claims and losses, <i>i.e</i>., so-called "whore actuaries". Get the actuaries to quit dummying up bogus actuarial studies, and the whole 831(b) tax shelter industry dies pretty quickly. Ditto, although to a lesser degree, for underwriting firms and consultants who priced policies for these captives, and for accounting firms that focused on 831(b) captives that had a high percentage of those clients with unfavorable audit results.</p>
      <p>Third, they might, which is much different than would, go after one or more captive owners who both reported large deductions (think: in the millions) for premium payments to their captives, and continued to take those deductions well after they were on notice, through an audit or otherwise, that those deductions were not defensible.</p>
      <p>There is also an outside chance that the IRS could target one of the newer abusive captive arrangements, such as the so-called "<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayadkisson/2018/01/27/beware-the-puerto-rico-captive-insurance-tax-shelter/">Puerto Rico Deal</a>" which is being hotly marketed now, and which is arguably uber-abusive.</p>
      <p>As to a criminal referral to DOJ-TAX, the target environment there is not so rich since DOJ-TAX would have to prove tax fraud beyond a reasonable doubt, which is a much higher standard than that something is a mere tax shelter. Here, it would likely be a captive manager and their client who was caught fabricating claims after-the-fact so as to try to justify the premiums paid to the captive, or the IRS had audio tapes or other evidence of the captive manager selling the captive as a tax shelter but then later falsely testifying that there were no tax motivations for the arrangements.</p>
      <p>Whether DOJ-TAX will bring an indictment in 2019 is questionable, however, for the reason that there are captive cases on appeal from the U.S. Tax Court, and the last thing that DOJ-TAX would want to do is to indict somebody only to see the underlying civil case reversed on appeal. Also, criminal cases take much longer to build than civil cases for injunctive relief, because IRS criminal investigations would want to do a very in-depth study of the evidence prior to making a criminal referral. Taking these things together, only after an appeal is denied (or the taxpayer does not take an appeal after losing a Tax Court case) does the prospect of a criminal indictment arise. We'll have to see what happens there.</p>
      <p>Which is all to say that the forecast for a DOJ-TAX promoter injunction in 2019 is fair, in 2020 is probably high, and that the forecast for a criminal injunction before 2020 is probably pretty low.</p>
      <p>That DOJ-TAX is going to have to do something to cut off the continued marketing of abusive 831(b) arrangements almost goes without saying. While many captive managers have back off, substantially or completely, their continued marketing and sale of abusive 831(b) arrangements, there are quite a few of such captive managers who are still selling at full speed, either oblivious to the danger or else trying to make as much money as possible before the music ends.</p>
      <p>Personally, I am still getting calls from folks who have been pitched these arrangements who want me to review them, and are surprised when I start telling them the trouble with such deal and that they shouldn't even be considering them. "But my CPA says that this is a great way to save taxes!" is just as popular a refrain in 2019 as it was in 2015 before Notice 2016-66 was published. Many of these callers are physicians who have high income that they want to shelter, but have very little risk over their existing malpractice policies, and somebody has pitched them a captive program (usually a "protected cell" or "series captive") as the cure for all their tax ills. Usually that somebody pitching them the deal is a captive manager who I know to be under a promoter examination.</p>
      <p>I don't think that is going to stop until DOJ-TAX slams somebody, and apparently the IRS has come to the same conclusion. We'll see.</p>
