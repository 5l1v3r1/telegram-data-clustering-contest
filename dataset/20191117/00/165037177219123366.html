        <b>According to the headlines of the newspaper 'Sport' on Sunday, FC Barcelona rejected a 15 million offer from a Premier League team for Ivan Rakitic.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rakitic is going through a rough patch at Barcelona. The Croat, a key player since his arrival at the club, has been given a<b> secondary role</b> this season.</p>
      <p>Valverde isn't giving opportunities to Rakitic and you just have to look at the <b>number of minutes </b>he has played: <b>255</b> in a total of 10 matches.</p>
      <p>He doesn't have a place in the Barcelona team and this has <b>made him think of leaving</b>, even in January. In fact, the player spoke of his sadness in an interview and Valverde didn't know what to respond.</p>
