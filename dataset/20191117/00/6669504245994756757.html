      <p>TAMPA, Fla. - Connor Hellebuyck made 31 saves and the Winnipeg Jets overcame Steven Stamkos’ 400th goal to beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 4-3 Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old Stamkos is the ninth active player and 98th overall to reach the milestone.</p>
      <p>Mathieu Perreault, Nikolaj Ehlers, Jack Roslovic and Kyle Connor scored for Winnipeg, which is on a 6-1-1 roll. The Jets are 9-1-1 this season in one-goal games.</p>
      <p>Andrei Vasilevskiy finished with 23 saves. Victor Hedman got his fourth of the season for Tampa Bay, which ended a season-best three-game winning streak. Anthony Cirelli also scored.</p>
      <p>Perreault opened the scoring 1:59 into the game, tipping a long-range shot from the left point by Josh Morrissey. Tampa Bay answered with 48.6 seconds left when Hedman pounced on a loose puck in the crease.</p>
      <p>The Jets struck twice in the span of 21 seconds in the second period, thanks to some help from Lightning coach Jon Cooper.</p>
      <p>After Roslovic put Winnipeg in front 2-1 with his fourth of the season at the 7:18 mark, Cooper issued a challenge believing the puck was knocked down by Ehlers with a high stick 18 seconds before the goal that would have resulted in a stoppage of play. The play was reviewed and the goal stood, which resulted in a delay of game penalty on Tampa Bay.</p>
      <p>On the ensuing power play, Ehlers found space at the bottom of the right circle and snapped a wrist shot to the short side over Vasilevskiy’s glove at 7:39. Tampa Bay had successfully killed off 17 consecutive power plays prior to the goal.</p>
      <p>Stamkos pulled the Lightning within a goal on a one-timer with 2:16 left in the third period before Connor added an empty-net goal with 1:28 left. Cirelli scored with 21.9 seconds remaining.</p>
      <p>NOTES: Winnipeg C Bryan Little missed his fifth consecutive game since being struck by a puck near his ear during a game on Nov. 6, his seventh game back since missing the start of the season with a concussion. ... Tampa Bay has allowed the opening goal 11 times in 17 games. ... Lightning D Braydon Coburn was a healthy scratch for the fourth consecutive game. ... Steven Stamkos has points five consecutive games. ... Ehlers has seven goals in nine career games against Tampa Bay.</p>
