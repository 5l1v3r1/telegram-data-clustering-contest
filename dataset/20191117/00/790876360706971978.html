          <p><b>1. Accept that you have writer's block.</b> When you have writer's block, no ideas spring to mind when you are writing and you are stuck for what to write. Understand that writer's block is easy to overcome, and there are many ways to get over it. Do not stop to the idea that you will never write again.</p>
          <blockquote>EXPERT TIP<br/><br/><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Special:ArticleReviewers?name=lucyv.hay#lucyv.hay">Lucy V. Hay <br/></a>Author, Screenwriter &amp; Script Editor <br/>Lucy V. Hay is an author, script editor and blogger who helps other writers through writing workshops, courses, and her blog Bang2Write. Lucy is the producer of two British thrillers and her debut crime novel, The Other Twin, is currently being adapted for the screen by Free@Last TV, makers of the Emmy-nominated Agatha Raisin. <br/><br/><b>The key to overcoming writer's block is to think about what's getting in your way.</b> Author and screenwriter Lucy Hay says: "Usually, the more experienced of a writer you become, the less likely you'll have writer's block, although that's not necessarily always true. You just have to figure out what works to help you overcome whatever's stopping you. That might be personal motivation, or it might have to do with the logistics of how you write, like your time and resources."<cite>Lucy V.

            <p><b>2. Write about anything.</b> Anything in the world - even write about pineapples. It gets your brain to think more and be creative. This works best for many people. Once you've thought of a paragraph or a few sentences about your topic go back to your story.</p>

              <p><b>3. Get some ideas on paper without worrying about how they sound.</b> The writing does not have to be polished; writers often have writer's block because they worry about the quality of their writing. Remember that nobody has to see a word you've written except you. You can show it to the world when you're ready.</p>

                <p><b>4. Try a change of pace.</b> For example, if you have a long, action-packed sequence, try going over to a reasoned conversation. Be sure that the changeover makes sense. You don't have to write in one speed or one tone all the time. Something completely different can really end up inspiring you to reach new depths. If you tend to write dramatic scenes, switch to something a bit more lighthearted, or vice versa.</p>

Use any random word or sentence to help you come up with a plot and start writing your story. For example, if you asked a friend to give you a prompt and they said the words "Forever" and "Passion" you would most likely think of a romance. And if they were to give you the phrase "Bite me" then you would most likely think of a vampire or werewolf. (Twilight anybody?)</p>

Try picking something in the genre you're writing in, whether it's Sci-Fi, Romance, or a Thriller, to get ideas about your subject matter.</p>

Music is a great way to break down that writer's block; listen to what you enjoy, but don't let the music become a serious distraction. You need to spend most of your time writing, not singing along or dancing.</li>
                                                            <li>If you can't do any of those things, just read: reading can give you many ideas about how to write and what to write. Take a break; you may need it. Try to write every day, but do not force yourself too much. Your writing will not benefit from it.</li>
                                                            <li>Don't be afraid to stress your character's personality a bit -- but not too much or they'll become very disliked (unless they're the antagonist or are supposed to be disliked).</li>
                                                            <li>Get it written, it doesn't need to be "right". Your first draft isn't your final draft, after all. Don't be such a perfectionist.</li>
                                                            <li>If you enjoy art, try drawing one of the characters, scenes, places, objects, or anything else from your story; it will really help with your writer's block. Designing your envisioned book cover may help you get excited about your story and revitalize your inspiration for it.</li>

                                                            <li>Write a paragraph that sounds good - exciting, touching, or any other type of good - then see if you can't come up with a story to fit it.</li>

If it's a romance novel and you're stuck on a scene that you want to put together perfectly for the two lovers, listen to something that mirrors it musically.</li>
                                                            <li>You can use these steps to visualize a storyline, it works just as well.</li>
                                                            <li>Do a mock interview with your characters to practice characterization, or design some character sheets for them. Understanding your character is a key part of writing!</li>
                                                            <li>Leave it alone for a while. If you're ever just thinking one day while on writer's block, you may wind up finding a new idea stored somewhere in your brain! Just leave it be, and if you don't stress about it, you'll be fine.</li>
                                                            <li>When stuck on a character, imagine what they look like, what they're wearing, or how they act.</li>

                                                            <li>Have a character do something they totally wouldn't, like dye their hair purple.</li>
                                                            <li>Asking for help with the steps can reward an even better result.</li>
                                                            <li>Just wait, inspiration will strike eventually. If you have no ideas maybe you should leave the manuscript around for a few weeks and then come back to it.</li>

Write anything except about the thing you are "blocked" about. Just write, fast and furiously, and from that writing, you will find the thread, or the fuel to continue with your project unimpeded.</li>
