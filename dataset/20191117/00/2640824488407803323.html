      <p><b><i>‘the science park model of the 1990s, with buildings isolated from one another by un-utilized landscape is no longer adequate for today’s workspaces that are more social in nature,’</i> says christopher lee, principal of <a href="https://www.serie.co.uk/">serie architects</a>.</b> <i>‘the first of more than five buildings in the cluster, 5 science park drive is designed to ensure that common spaces are visible, accessible and nourished with amenities.’</i></p>

      <p><b>focused on collaboration, discussion and networking, the three-storey ‘city room’ incorporates a series of cascading platforms that contain a café, break-out spaces, and a small auditorium.</b> throughout the design, the floor plans have been designed to maximize flexibility. a typical floorplate offers over 4,000 square meters in open plan space and column-free spans of 20 meters. meanwhile, centralized circulation with highly efficient double-loaded corridors allows the building to be configured for single or multi-tenant use.</p>

      <p><b>the façade features high performance glazing set into an alternating ‘accordion’ design that is animated at night with a re-programmable led light system.</b> the design combines vision and spandrel glazing to maximize views while mitigating solar gain. the adjacent car park has been covered with extensive landscaping and amenities including exercise pavilions. this will eventually form a shared park for a cluster of six new technology buildings. 5SPD has already been fully let to e-commerce start-up <a href="https://shopee.com/"><b>shopee</b></a> and will eventually house 3,000 members of staff.</p>
