        <b>PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (CMC) — BP Trinidad and Tobago (BPTT) says it has made a gas discovery with the Ginger exploration well approximately 50 miles off the south-east coast of Trinidad.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a statement BPTT said the well is expected to be completed by the end of November 2019 and that the results of the Ginger well will continue to be evaluated after drilling operations are complete, but initial results are promising.</p>
      <p>The company said the exploration well was drilled into two untested fault blocks east of the Cashima Field in water depths less than 300 feet. It was drilled using a jack up rig and has penetrated hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs in 15 segments.</p>
      <p>“This is positive news for both BPTT and the industry, as these discoveries continue BPTT's exploration success on the Trinidad shelf following the Savannah and Macadamia commercial discoveries,” said the company's regional president, Claire Fitzpatrick.</p>
      <p>“We are continuing to see the benefits of the significant investment we have made in seismic processing and ocean bottom seismic acquisition,” Fitzpatrick said, adding that the Columbus Basin is a maturing province and the Ginger discovery “demonstrates that with the right technology we can continue to uncover further resource potential in the basin”.</p>
      <p>“This demonstrates our ongoing commitment to the development of our Trinidad and Tobago operations and the wider industry,” said BPTT, which has a 100 per cent working interest in Ginger.</p>
      <p>BPTT operates off Trinidad's east coast and has 15 off­shore platforms and two on­shore processing facilities. BPTT is 70 per cent owned by BP and 30 per cent owned by Repsol.</p>
