        <b>Pizzi Fernandes, the Benfica and Portugal player, criticised the pitch after the game Portugal played on it versus Luxembourg.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Portugal beat Luxembourg 0-2 </b>thanks to goals from <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/bruno-miguel-borges-fernandes-193339/">Bruno Fernandes</a> and <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/c-ronaldo-28185">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. And <b>they did so on a rather poor pitch.</b> </p>
      <p>One side of the pitch was very badly affected. There were notable divots and the surface was very uneven which put the players' safety at risk.<b> Obviously it was not easy to play football on it</b>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, <b>Pizzi did not hesistate in criticising the playing surface</b> after the encounter: "We shouldn't be playing on pitches like that at this level, but that was how it was. We had quite a positive mentality, <b>we knew it would be a difficult game</b>, we have qualified and now it is time to wait and see what comes."</p>
