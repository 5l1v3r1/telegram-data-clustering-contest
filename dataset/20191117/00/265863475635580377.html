      <h1>The Frozen 2 Soundtrack Is Only Thirty-One Minutes Long And Your Kids Are Going To Make You Listen To Every Second Of It</h1>

      <p>The <i>Frozen 2</i> soundtrack is here and though it’s only 31 minutes long, chances are your kids are going to love it and with that, they are going to make you listen to it. That’s okay because there’s plenty in this album that will appeal to adults as well. Just about everyone remembers the “Let It Go” craze from the first album. There are several songs on the <i>Frozen 2</i> soundtrack that have the potential of getting as big as “Let It Go” did. Disney always has superstar talent in their movies as well as those who aren’t in the movie to perform a reprise of several songs from the film.</p>
      <p>Parents will appreciate that some of the additional singers on the <i>Frozen 2</i> soundtrack include Kacey Musgraves, Panic! At The Disco, and Weezer. Also joining on the soundtrack is Norwegian singer AURORA.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Evan Rachel Wood joins the cast for <i>Frozen 2 </i>voicing the character Iduna, and fans remember her singing in <i>Across The Universe</i>. Evan sings the song “All Is Found” and joins Idina Menzel in the duet “Show Yourself.”</p>
      <p>Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel are the big draws to the film and their songs will hook kids just like they did in <i>Frozen</i>. Kristen sings <i>The Next Right Thing</i> as a solo and young girls will be singing this song throughout Christmas, and most likely into New Year’s.</p>
      <p>There is one song that features Josh Gad, Jonathan Groff, Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, and the cast. It’s called <i>Some Things Never Change</i> and it’s fun, upbeat timing will be enjoyable for kids to sing along with.</p>
      <p>The powerhouse song on the album is delivered by Idina Menzel with Norweigian singer AURORA: <i>Into The Unknown</i>.  AURORA provides ethereal background vocals that is going to make this song the standout for kids worldwide.</p>
      <p>Following up with <i>Into The Unknown</i> is Panic! At The Disco with their reprise that will blow listeners away.</p>
      <p>You may listen to AURORA and Idina Menzel perform <i>Into The Unknown</i> followed by Panic! At The Disco’s reprise version in the video players below.</p>

      <p>Evan Rachel Wood sings “All Is Found” and Kacey Musgraves delivers a reprisal with her own spin. Kacey’s version is slower and with more of a folk or country feel.</p>
      <p>Josh Gad sings “When I Am Older” and Jonathan Groff has his incredible vocals on full display with the songs “Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People” and he delivers an amazing performance on <i>Lost In The Woods</i>. Weezer follows up with their reprisal of the same song and closes out the album with it.</p>
      <p>There’s no doubt that kids are going to be clamoring for Frozen III after they watch this movie and listen to the soundtrack.</p>
      <p>Are you going to see Frozen 2 when it opens in theaters on November 22, 2019?</p>
