      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari has admitted reorganising the Presidency for improved performance.</p>
      <p>The President, who spoke on Friday on arrival from London after his private visit to the UK, decried what he called “ethnic and political” interpretations given to the reorganisation of political appointees in the office of Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo.</p>
      <p>Buhari explained that his administration had created additional ministries, which required that certain offices and functions would be moved out of the Villa.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Presidential Wing of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, Buhari said, “They said 35 people were sacked in the vice president’s office.</p>
      <p>“We just created some ministries and we reorganised and people are giving it ethnic and political dimensions. It is unfortunate.”</p>
      <p>Asked what next Nigerians would expect from his government, Buhari replied that he was prepared to work harder.</p>
      <p>He added that accountability by those in government was not negotiable.</p>
      <p>‘‘We are going to work harder and be accountable. We have tried to make Nigerians understand why we do certain things. Accountability from bottom to top is absolutely necessary.</p>
      <p>“That’s what I expect and I think that we have been around long enough to impress it on people that we mean what we say,” a statement by Buhari’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mr Garba Shehu, on Saturday quoted him as saying.</p>
