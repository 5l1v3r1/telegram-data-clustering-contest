      <p>It sounds like something from the award-winning former AMC series <i>Breaking Bad</i>: The authorities charged two chemistry professors in Arkansas on Friday in connection with the production of methamphetamine.</p>
      <p>The instructors, Terry Bateman, 45, and Bradley Rowland, 40, were charged with manufacturing methamphetamine and using drug paraphernalia, the Clark County Sheriff’s Department said. Meth is a highly addictive drug that can be manufactured illegally with chemicals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
      <p>Prof. Bateman and Prof. Rowland are associate professors of chemistry at Henderson State University, a liberal arts school of about 3,500 students in Arkadelphia, about 70 miles southwest of Little Rock.</p>
      <p>The professors went on administrative leave as of Oct. 11, Tina V. Hall, a university associate vice-president of marketing and communications, said on Sunday.</p>

      <p>Ms. Hall said that the school’s Reynolds Science Center had been closed on Oct. 8 because of “a report of an undetermined chemical odour.” Testing revealed an elevated presence of benzyl chloride in a lab, she said.</p>
      <p>Benzyl chloride is used to produce certain dyes and pharmaceutical products, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Short-term effects from inhaling it include irritation of the skin, eyes and upper respiratory tract.</p>
      <p>“Benzyl chloride is an inexpensive and versatile chemical that is used to make many other useful drugs and molecules,” Eric Simanek, a professor of chemistry at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Stephen Madison, who is on the chemistry faculty at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn., said that benzyl chloride could be used to help make methamphetamine.</p>
      <p>Henderson State University’s on-call environmental services company conducted remediation work in the building, which reopened on Oct. 29, Hall said.</p>
      <p>The arrests called to mind the wildly popular <i>Breaking Bad</i> series, which ran from 2008 to 2015. The drama followed Walter White, a high-school chemistry teacher played by Bryan Cranston who becomes an Albuquerque, N.M., drug lord when he can’t afford his cancer treatments.</p>
