      <p>LONDON (AP) - French duo Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert won the doubles title at the ATP Finals for the first time on Sunday after going through the entire tournament without dropping a set.</p>
      <p>Mahut and Herbert beat Raven Klaasen of South Africa and Michael Venus of New Zealand 6-3, 6-4 to complete a near-perfect week at the O2 Arena. The duo lost last year’s final to Mike Bryan and Jack Sock after a Champions tiebreaker that ended 13-11 to the Americans, failing to convert a match point along the way.</p>
      <p>Mahut and Herbert were seeded seventh but were the only players - in singles or doubles - to win all three round-robin matches.</p>
