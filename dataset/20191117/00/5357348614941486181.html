        <i>She scorns our poverty.</i>

        <b>She bears a Duke's revenue on her back, or should that read, while on her back? We'll never know. The fact is, a woman will always be able to survive and earn revenue, eke out a living and provide for herself and somehow survive.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's much easier if she's attractive, beautiful, gorgeous, sexy, as men will be drawn to her and she can draw from men. She has assets that can contribute to her own personal economy. Women who aren't so blessed will have to go to school to further themselves and make their lives comfortable.</p>
      <p>We always hear talk about the various economies such as the macroeconomy, the microeconomy, the underground economy, economies of scale and others. I'm no novice to the subject, for even though I'm no Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus or even a minister of finance, I can hold my own in a discussion and know enough to discern when things are going wrong.</p>
      <p>Yes, I did manage to pass my GCE 'A' Levels in economics back in the day while at KC, and back then, 'A' Levels were almost akin to having a first degree. The late Isaac Henry and Mr Bailey were our Econ teachers then, and oh how we used to have spirited discussions about economics and its effect on the world.</p>
      <p>There were tangible imports and exports, invisible earnings, Giffen good, the laws of supply and demand, the demand curve and so many facets that make up the economics of a country and indeed the world. But economics is not an exact science, for as long as people and politicians are involved, there will be variables and exceptions to the rules.</p>
      <p>For example, in the case of the Giffen good, that's a product that people consume more of as the price rises, and less of as the price falls, violating the basic law of supply and demand.</p>
      <p>What we didn't discuss was the sex economy. After all, we were young schoolboys. But young boys do grow up and we learned the ways of the world. That's what we'll be delving into today, the sex economy, right after these responses to 'Crimes against men'.</p>

        <b>Hi Tony,</b>
      </p>
      <p>Crimes against men often go unreported as opposed to crimes against women, which always make the headlines. When last have you heard of women being arrested and imprisoned for abusing men? When last have you heard of a woman being brought to book for non-payment of child maintenance? And yet those crimes against men occur with more regularity that you may think. The playing field should be levelled.</p>
      <p>

        <b>Hey Tony,</b>
      </p>
      <p>I totally agree with you, those women who falsify reports that men sexually abused them or raped them should be arrested, tried and locked up. It's just too easy for a woman to accuse a man, ruin his reputation, even have him arrested, then simply walk away scot-free after the charges are proven to be false. It doesn't take a conviction, all it takes is an accusation and the man is tarnished.</p>
      <p>

      <p>I know that lots of women may not like the tone of this week's article, but the truth has got to be told, and the truth shall set you free. Just last week a friend of mine showed me a <i>WhatsApp</i> message that he got from a lady friend of his. It showed a picture of the young lady, naked as the day she was born and exposing her private parts like she was at the gynaecologist's office.</p>
      <p>The accompanying words read, “Norman, if you want some of this just bring $5,000.” I changed his name, of course, but I couldn't change the look of surprise that overcame me when I saw the message. I simply could not believe the brazenness, the temerity, the classlessness of the woman to post that picture and to make that request in the pursuit of $5,000.</p>
      <p>But then again, why should I be surprised, why should I be taken aback, why should I be mortified by the actions of that woman? After all, women have been doing that for centuries, albeit a bit more discretely in most cases. It seems to have taken on a different dimension nowadays in the pursuit of dollars.</p>
      <p>Women have long learned that they have what men want, and men desire it so much that they are willing to pay handsomely for it. So all that woman did in the <i>WhatsApp</i> message was to apply a positive marketing strategy and put her product on the market for the buyer to see. Isn't that what economics is all about?</p>
      <p>So even as we have the various economies that I mentioned earlier, including the black market (I really hate that term) and the invisible underground markets, the sex market is a thriving, booming economy that the experts do not officially talk about. It's one of those invisible assets that we learned about in sixth form 'A' Level Econ class, but just didn't give it a name.</p>
      <p>You won't see it on any Government paper or financial policies, but it exists and is booming. Tourists contribute to it, locals benefit from it, but it won't show up on the balance sheet as it's a well-guarded yet open secret.</p>
      <p>Every now and then there will be a hue and cry and police will raid 'Back Road', which is our equivalent of the Red Light District in Amsterdam. That city earns revenue from the sex economy of that Red Light District, as tourists are drawn to it, both to indulge or just to window shop.</p>
      <p>Because of that invisible economy, many women are able to survive and send their children to school. Yes, it exists and will exist for as long as mankind walks this Earth. So many countries have accepted it, made it legal and even assist in the health care of the labour force ladies who contribute to the sex economy.</p>
      <p>That's on the macro side. On the microeconomy side, where the amateur individual woman runs her show, it takes on a different dimension. In the very same way that young lady sent my bredrin a <i>WhatsApp</i> photo of her <i>mons pubis</i> with accompanying message inviting him to partake of her wares for $5,000, there are other women who are far more subtle, even as they contribute to the sex economy.</p>
      <p>“As long as I have this and men want it, I cannot starve,” ladies have expressed. Money may not pass hands, but in so many major economic transactions, money does not come into the picture either. Remember the invisible economies.</p>
      <p>There are trade deals, tariffs, embargos, free trade agreements and myriad other transactions that contribute to economies of scale. Some women have mastered the craft, even as they craft the master.</p>
      <p>They seek out men of means, or the men seek them out. It doesn't matter what came first, the chicken or the egg, the economy is contributed to by the paying of rent, buying of groceries, paying of utility bills, giving them high-end vehicles and even paying for their tertiary education. You can see how the economy is affected in a positive way as so many entities benefit.</p>
      <p>Whenever you see a very young pretty lady driving a criss SUV I'm sure you may wonder, “Is muss man buy it give her.”</p>
      <p>I told you that it was an invisible economy and I also told you that many women would not like to hear it, but it's the truth, and the truth shall set you free, even though nothing is free.</p>
      <p>There are women who insist that men pay off their credit card bills, pay off their hire purchase furniture bills, pay for their vehicle repairs, even pay their medical bills, and fly them here and there.</p>
      <p>Why should a man do all that for a woman? Hmm, let me think. What do you think? As they say, nutten fi nutten but something for something. It's all about the sex economy, and even if men don't pay for sex directly, they still contribute to the economy and make it grow. The sex economy is alive and kicking.</p>

      <p><b>Footnote</b>: Recently I briefly mentioned the issue of paternity leave for fathers, and I'm all in favour of it. The fact that a father is gainfully employed means that he has a modicum of responsibility in at least one area of his life. He should be able to bond with his child. I have friends in foreign who actually took off a year from work to be with their baby, while the mother resumed working. We should at least give it a try.</p>
      <p>On a sad note, my <i>JIS</i> and Press Association Jamaica (PAJ) judge colleague and friend, Chappie St Juste, passed away recently. I was privileged to have worked with Chappie for many years, plus co-judged with him for the annual PAJ and Fair Play Awards. I was also privileged to spend time with him on his birthday a few weeks ago where we discussed Shakespeare and life in general. He waxed eloquent. RIP, Chappie, you had a life well lived.</p>
