      <p>A flight with 189 passengers on board made an emergency landing at an Orlando, Florida, airport Saturday when the Boeing 737 malfunctioned mid-air, according to a report.</p>
      <p>Canada-bound Air Transat Flight TS691 departed from Santa Clara, Cuba, around 12:40 p.m. and landed less than an hour later at Orlando International Airport, Greater Orlando Airport Authority spokeswoman Carolyn Fennell <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-ne-emergency-landing-orlando-airport-transat-20191116-aftwgb5ze5hhncnfrkqp3do3yy-story.html">told the Orlando Sentinel.</a></p>
      <p>The plane made the emergency diversion after declaring a “Mayday emergency for an engine shut down,” CTV News aviation reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/TomPodolec/status/1195768200539115520">Tom Podolec tweeted.</a></p>
      <p>The Montreal-based airline planned to send another plane to take passengers to Toronto, the Sentinel reported.</p>
