      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:05:32+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:05</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror.co.uk</a></address>
      <p>Ant McPartlin has thrown shade at controversial Katie Hopkins as he admitted she wasn't his favourite of the bunch of previous I'm A Celebrity campmates.</p>
      <p>Katie, 44, shot to fame on The Apprentice in 2007 and starred in that year's series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</p>
      <p>But Ant, 43, shed some light as to why the media personality - who holds a lot of unpopular opinions - wasn't seen too much on the show.</p>
      <p>Telly favourite Ant confessed there wasn't much to her, saying "she didn't really shine".</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10360802/im-a-celeb-ant-dec-questions/">The Sun</a> : "Katie Hopkins was in I'm A Celebrity but you wouldn't really remember her doing it, as she didn't really shine."</p>
      <p>And Dec Donnelly, 44, also opened up about the truth behind Gillian McKeith not participating in trials.</p>

      <p>He said: "Gillian McKeith not doing trials was frustrating at the time but that was her journey on the show."</p>
      <p>The Geordie star added he felt sorry for the people who were organising the Bushtucker trials as she refused to do them.</p>
      <p>The 2019 series of I'm A Celeb starts tomorrow night and is already set to be a blast as the exciting new line-up of stars landed in Oz earlier this week.</p>

      <p>Some of the favourite celebs heading into the dreaded Jungle include reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner, former EastEnders star Jacqueline Jossa, football personality Ian Wright and Capital DJ Roman Kemp.</p>
      <p>But on this year's show, there will be no live critters eaten in the Bushtucker trials after complaints from some animals lovers.</p>

      <p>Sources at ITV say producers have taken a look at the trials and decided that no live critters would be used in the food-based challenges this year.</p>
      <p>A source said: "They have been planning this for some time and actually last year beach worms were the only critters eaten live but this time around they've decided to implement the change fully and permanently."</p>
