      <p>CAIRO – 17 November 2019: President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi on Sunday morning left Cairo for Berlin, to attend the G20 Compact with Africa meetings held in the German capital, the Presidency said in statement. <br/><br/>The G20 Compact with Africa initiative aims to support economic cooperation between Africa and G20 countries through joint projects that contribute to accelerating development in the continent, presidential spokesman Bassam Radi said. <br/><br/>The initiative was launched by Germany in 2017 during its presidency of the G20 summit, with the aim of supporting development and attracting investment in the African countries, Radi added. <br/><br/>Sisi is scheduled to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, within the framework of strengthening bilateral relations between Egypt and Germany in various fields. <br/><br/>They are also set to exchange views on the developments of regional and international issues of mutual concern. <br/><br/>The President will also meet with business leaders and heads of major German industrial companies, as part of Egypt's strategy to encourage investment, promote comprehensive development efforts, and review the developments of economic reform in Egypt and updates of the implementation of development projects underway. <br/><br/>Sisi on Friday received a telephone call from German Chancellor Angela Merkel where they exchanged visions on key regional and international issues, Radi said. <br/><br/>The two leaders discussed the Libyan issue, Radi said, adding that Merkel affirmed her keenness to know about the president's vision on the developments of the Libyan issue, in light of Egypt's pivotal role in the region and its chairmanship of the African Union this year. <br/><br/>In October, head of the international vocational training program at the German Corporation for International Cooperation (GIZ) Thomas Rolf said he expects the G20 Compact with Africa, held to promote private investment in Africa, will help increase cooperation between the German companies and Egypt. <br/><br/>The G20 Compact with Africa’s primary objective is to increase attractiveness of private investment through substantial improvements of the macro, business and financing frameworks. The Berlin-hosted event brings together reform-minded African countries, international organizations and bilateral partners from G20 and beyond to coordinate country-specific reform agendas, support respective policy measures and advertise investment opportunities to private investors.</p>
