      <h1>Kasavanahalli Lake pathway gives in</h1>

      <p><i>Craters started appearing after pipeline work was done here</i> <br/><br/>The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) claims it has worked day in and day out to rid the city of potholes. What they did would have been on the roads, but little did they know that some of the biggest potholes in the city lie around the periphery of Kasavanahalli Lake. The culprit for this gaping hole in the middle of the pathway around the Kasavanahalli Lake is the Cauvery water pipeline work. Just after the pipeline was laid around the lake, it left behind crater-sized potholes has led to the collapse of the walking path of the lake. Out of the total 2.5 km periphery of the lake, around 1 km of the walk path was dug up by Bangalore water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) to lay the pipeline. <br/><br/>The work had been taken up nearly one year ago by Larsen &amp; Toubro (L &amp; T) on a contractual basis. Though the paths were repaired after the pipeline was laid, portions of the path come crumbling every now and then. <br/><br/>Siva Pagadala, a lake volunteer, says, “The work was completed six months ago. The contractors visited the lake whenever we complained but the quality of the work undertaken is pretty poor. We still have a portion of the path caved in that is almost all along the breadth of the path. The contractors have not done a good job. New craters keep forming every now and then. The biggest crater sized collapse happened two months ago. Even the boundaries of the walk path have been damaged. Whenever it rains, the path becomes slushier as it is muddy.” <br/><br/>Residents say that before the work had started, the walk path, though muddy, was in a good condition and levelled, making it easier for walkers and joggers to move around. “Only the 1 km portion where the work happened, keeps caving in, the rest 1.5 km is as good as before.” <br/><br/>Though no one has been injured due to the hole in the path so far, once a car carrying sand bags to fill in the inlet pipe of the lake got stuck in the portion. <br/>A contractor from L &amp; T who had taken up the Cauvery water pipeline laying work says, “We had started the work a year ago and have now completed the work with the laying of the Cauvery water pipeline. I also visited the lake before the monsoon to check if the work has been done properly. Whenever we have received complaints, we have sent workers and levelled the craters. Last, we had sent workers to level the walk path in October.”</p>
