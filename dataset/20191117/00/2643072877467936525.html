      <p>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has declared 30 of its staff missing in the ongoing Kogi Election.</p>
      <p>Naija News reports that the INEC ad-hoc staff took part in Saturday’s governorship election in Kogi state, north-central Nigeria.</p>
      <p>This online news platform understands that the INEC staff were posted to Olamaboro Local Government Area (LGA) by the commission and were declared missing around 1 a.m. on Sunday during the final collation of results in the local government.</p>
      <p>According to the commission, the missing INEC staff include Presiding Officers (POs) and Assistant Presiding Officers (APOs) of polling units in Imane ward 1 and 2 of Olamaboro LGA of Kogi State.</p>
      <p>Many of the ad-hoc staff used by INEC are members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC).</p>
      <p>Announcing the sad incident, the LGA Election Officer, in-charge of collating and announcing the local government’s results, Garba Mahmood, said the INEC ad-hoc staff were reported missing after the observation of some police officers who raised concern that they were last seen shortly after voting ended at 2 p.m. on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Mahmood said repeated calls to their telephone numbers did not go through.</p>
      <p>He therefore declared them missing and then released the names of the missing persons.</p>
