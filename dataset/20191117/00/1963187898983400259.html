      <p>Liverpool Senegalese player, Sadio Mane, believes that the reason for his outstanding appearance with Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino in Liverpool is simply the way they work. <br/><br/>"I always say that it is very easy to work together, I consider myself lucky to play next to these big players," he told the club magazine. <br/><br/>"Any player will enjoy playing next to them because they are so good and they make everything easy so I enjoy playing for them." <br/><br/>"We are from different countries and we speak different languages, but I think football is the same and it is universal so anyone can speak it, for me, for Firmino and Salah." <br/><br/>Mane scored 7 goals while Mohamed Salah scored 6 goals and 3 for the Brazilian this season in the English Premier League. <br/><br/>"I have no words to explain how great or successful Liverpool coach is," he said. "Everyone can see what he has done for the club and the city, and the quality he has as a manager." <br/><br/>"He always has the right words and the right attitude to manage the team, and I am confident in his impact on the team." <br/><br/>The Senegalese have made 140 appearances for Liverpool in all competitions, scoring 70 goals, assisting 27 and winning the Champions League.</p>
