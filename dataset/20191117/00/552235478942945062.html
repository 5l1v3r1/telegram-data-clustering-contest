      <h1>Borna Barisic reveals Rangers departure thoughts and mentality change that sparked stunning form turnaround</h1>
      <h2>The Croatian international full-back has explained the change of outlook that sparked his dramatic Ibrox resurgence.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Scott McDermott, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-mcdermott/</a></address>
      <p>NK Osijek rarely fill their Gradski Stadium to its 17,000 capacity.</p>
      <p>And in the Croatian top flight they still live in the shadow of giants Dinamo Zagreb and Hadjuk Split.</p>
      <p>So it’s no surprise <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/borna-barisic">Borna Barisic</a> had a small-club mentality when he pitched up in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>At Osijek, a draw wasn’t a catastrophe. Finishing third in the league was a success.</p>
      <p>And as a professional, he could probably get away with letting his standards slip.</p>
      <p>But that all changed when he signed for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> – even if Barisic didn’t realise it.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old had a poor first season at Ibrox. After impressing in the Europa League qualifiers against Steven Gerrard’s side, he was snared in the summer of 2018.</p>
      <p>But with injuries, a loss of form and – by his own admission – the wrong attitude, Barisic struggled to adapt to Scottish football.</p>

      <p>The pressure and intensity of being an Old Firm player took its toll on the Croatia left-back.</p>
      <p>At one point, he was ready to quit this country, fearing he’d made the wrong move.</p>
      <p>But Barisic stuck at it. And in the close season, he took a hard look at how he was living his life.</p>
      <p>On and off the pitch, he knew he had to improve or Gerrard would show him the door. And to his credit, he’s been like a new signing for Rangers this term.</p>
      <p>After a tricky start to the campaign, he curled in a free-kick winner against St Mirren – and hasn’t looked back since.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Barisic has been outstanding in the Premiership and Europa League, with his assist for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> ’ goal in Porto a standout moment.</p>
      <p>The defender has revealed he had to turn his life around to be a success at Ibrox.</p>
      <p>Watching consummate pros like Jermain Defoe and Steven Davis every day has given him a new outlook – but a pep talk from Gerrard was a pivotal moment.</p>
      <p>Barisic said: “I came back from pre-season in good shape. I knew that when I was on holiday, that I needed to train – to make sure I was fit and ready to go.</p>
      <p>“When I scored a great goal against St Mirren, it gave me a lift.</p>

      <p>“But after that I had a chat with the manager and we were both honest with each other.</p>
      <p>“I won’t say what we spoke about but I felt better after it – and I started to play a lot better.</p>
      <p>“Last season I had a few injuries and couldn’t settle down here. My mindset was different.</p>
      <p>“Now, I feel I have the mentality that is needed to be a Rangers player.</p>
      <p>“To play here, your mentality has to be to win every single game.</p>
      <p>“You have to be brave and try to take this team to the top of Scottish football.</p>
      <p>“When you play for Rangers, it isn’t just about physical fitness. The mental side is important too.</p>
      <p>“I came from the Croatian league with Osijek and it’s completely different there.</p>
      <p>“On holiday last summer, I thought a lot about what I had to do better at Rangers.</p>

      <p>“I’ve learned from the likes of Jermain, Steven and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-arfield">Scott Arfield</a> , guys who have more experience than me.</p>
      <p>“And of course, the gaffer and coaching staff have helped me as well.</p>
      <p>“This squad is mentally stronger than last year.</p>
      <p>“We’ve all lifted our levels. The pressure is massive at this club but I know now how to deal with it. Now I don’t feel the pressure.</p>
      <p>“I just feel confident in myself and this team.</p>
      <p>“I’m on a good path again and confident about my future now.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Did I think about leaving here last year? Yes, I have to be honest, around February or March I thought Rangers and Scotland wasn’t for me.</p>
      <p>“It was a hard time for me but that is normal when you get injuries. You start to think that maybe it’s too much.</p>
      <p>“But I listened to the gaffer and kept working.</p>
      <p>“I knew I could do better and I’m in a good place now.”</p>
      <p>That place is joint top of the league alongside Celtic and sitting pretty in their Europa League group.</p>
      <p>Barisic is relishing a fight for the title as Gers’ bid to stop nine-in-a-row. And given some of the Euro heroics at Ibrox and Parkhead this year – the Croat says people outside of Scotland will now show more respect to the league.</p>
      <p>He said: “People will see the Scottish league as very strong this year because of what Rangers and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> have achieved in Europe.</p>
      <p>“The title race has actually helped us in the European games.</p>

      <p>“People who don’t know the league told me before I came that I could take it easy in Scotland.</p>
      <p>“But you can’t! Every game is difficult and we have important games every three days.</p>
      <p>“When we play some teams in Europe it’s like they don’t have a lot of respect for us.</p>
      <p>“But we’ve shown how good a team we are and in the future, they’ll have to respect us. Teams may treat us differently now.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Barisic admits the atmosphere at Ibrox on a European night is so electric that he can’t explain it to his family.</p>
      <p>He said: “The Porto victory at Ibrox was a big win for us.</p>
      <p>“If we keep playing like that, we have to believe that we can qualify for the next round.</p>
      <p>“When I speak to friends and family about coming to watch me I tell them to come on a European night – because they are so special.</p>
      <p>“I can’t explain it to them – they have to see it for themselves.”</p>
