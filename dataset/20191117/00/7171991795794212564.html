      <h1>Harmonic Analyzer Does It With Cranks And Gears</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/lewinday/" target="_blank">Lewin Day</a></address>
      <p>Before graphic calculators and microcomputers, plotting functions were generally achieved by hand. However, there were mechanical graphing tools, too. <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Harmonic-Analyzer-Mechanical-Lasercut-Signal-Plott/">With the help of a laser cutter, it’s even possible to make your own!</a></p>
      <p>The build in question is nicknamed the Harmonic Analyzer. It can be used to draw functions created by adding sine waves, a la the Fourier series. While a true Fourier series is the sum of an infinite number of sine waves, this mechanical contraption settles on just 5.</p>
      <p>This is achieved through the use of a crank driving a series of gears. The x-axis gearing pans the notepad from left to right. The function gearing has a series of gears for each of the 5 sinewaves, which work with levers to set the magnitude of the coefficients for each component of the function. These levers are then hooked up to a spring system, which adds the outputs of each sine wave together. This spring adder then controls the y-axis motion of the pen, which draws the function on paper.</p>
      <p>It’s a great example of the capabilities of mechanical computing, even if it’s unlikely to ever run <i>Quake. </i>Other DIY mechanical computers we’ve seen include <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/11/10/3d-print-your-very-own-mechanical-computer/">the Digi-Comp I</a> and <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/08/08/differential-analyzer-cranks-out-math-like-a-champ-at-vcf-2016/">a wildly complex Differential Analyzer</a>.
