      <p>"Michel Platini's ban is over. <b>So he can be part in any role in football</b> except as a football player, I think he is a bit old," Ceferin said of the 64-year-old.</p>
      <p>Platini is on record this week as tantalisingly saying <b>there would be no rush </b>as elections for top roles at FIFA and UEFA are "some years ahead". Platini told Swiss television channel RTS in September that he "will be back". <b>The former France captain was banned in 2015</b> for receiving a two-million Swiss francs (1.8 million euros, $2 million) payment from ex-FIFA chief Sepp Blatter, <b>who was himself suspended for six years</b>.</p>
      <p>"I will be back. I don't know where,<b> I don't know how.</b> I can't stay on the suspension, even if it's a suspension made by idiots," Platini said. "I was a victim of a form of a plot, yes, totally, between those at FIFA and those at the Swiss public ministry. <b>There was an agreement between FIFA and them to sack me</b>. I'm not going to say it was a plot by the Swiss state,"</p>
