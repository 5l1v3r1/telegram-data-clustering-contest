      <p><b>Topline</b>: HP’s board of directors unanimously rejected a proposal from Xerox to acquire the company, HP announced Sunday, scuttling a deal that would have united the two struggling printing companies—but the rejection left open the possibility of a deal after more due diligence.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In a letter to Xerox’s CEO, HP’s board of directors said Xerox’s proposal “significantly undervalues HP and is not in the best interests of HP shareholders,” adding that a combined company might have too much debt.</li>
        <li>HP also said it had reservations about the decline in Xerox’s revenue, which has decreased from $10.2 billion to $9.2 billion since June 2018.</li>
        <li>But a deal could still be worked out in the future, HP said, if Xerox hands over due diligence information about its business. </li>
        <li>Xerox had offered to spend $22 per share, or $33.5 billion, to acquire HP earlier this month, making the case that combining both companies would result in $2 billion in cost savings over two years.</li>
        <li>The rejection is a loss for famed investor Carl Icahn, who <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ramkumarrajachidambaram/2019/11/15/how-icahns-support-is-boost-to-latest-hp-xerox-merger/#e5da1ec4f38e">pushed</a> for a merger. Icahn holds a 10.6% stake in Xerox as well as a 4.24% stake in HP.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Xerox did not immediately respond to a request for comment from <i>Forbes</i>.</p>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: Both companies are struggling as exchanging digital documents—instead of printing them—becomes the norm. HP, which makes computers and printers, said it would <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/10/03/incoming-hp-ceo-announces-7000-9000-layoffs-as-part-of-major-restructuring/#1b1adfa4777d">cut</a> up to 9,000 jobs or 16% of its workforce by the end of 2022 while Xerox is undergoing a $640 million cost-savings program. </p>
      <p><b>Crucial quote</b>: “We recognize the potential benefits of consolidation, and we are open to exploring whether there is value to be created for HP shareholders through a potential combination with Xerox. However, as we have previously shared in connection with our prior requests for diligence, we have fundamental questions that need to be addressed in our diligence of Xerox,” the HP letter reads. </p>
