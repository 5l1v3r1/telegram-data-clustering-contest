      <p>In new release news that isn’t <i>Charlie’s Angels</i>, <i>Ford v Ferrari </i>easily topped the box office with a dynamite $31 million opening weekend. That is a promising 2.83x weekend multiplier along with a very promising A+ from Cinemascore. It positions the James Mangold racing for a potentially leggy and Oscar-friendly run. Presuming it legs out, which it darn well should, it’ll be the first honest-to-goodness big hit for Fox under the Disney umbrella. It’s also exactly the kind of movie, essentially a blockbuster for adults, that I’d argue (partially) motivated Disney buying Fox in the first place. It’s a splashy, muscular, star-driven (Christian Bale and Matt Damon) studio programmer. And unlike a lot of recent “big movies for grownups” offerings, it’s not just a damn good movie, it’s aggressively fun. The Bale/Damon flick is a drama, and there are moments of peril and melodrama, but it was (accurately) sold as pure “David vs. Goliath” escapism. Most of the conflict is “Gee, why won’t the rich dudes let us win Le Mans our way?” It’s not a grimly violent crime flick like <i>Widows </i>or <i>The Kitchen</i>, nor is it a wrenching melodrama like <i>The Goldfinch </i>or <i>The Hate U Give</i>. Heck, even <i>Ad Astra </i>was sold as an outer space fantasy but was, as most folks knew going in, a grim “sins of the father” drama that played like <i>Apocalypse Now </i>in space. That’s not a quality judgment, but if audiences want escapism and a good time at the movies, well, that’s just as true for dudes as it is for women.</p>
      <p>In that sense, <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> is not unlike <i>Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood</i>. Sony successfully sold the Quentin Tarantino flick as a movie star combo (Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt) playing colorful characters amid splashy and playfully entertaining old-school Hollywood melodrama. Fox’s <i>Ford v Ferrari </i>is the closest thing adults (it’s PG-13, but it’s aimed at your dad) since the Tarantino blockbuster. In terms of how it was sold, the Bale/Damon flick was sold as mostly conflict-free, “empowering,” car-filled, racing-centric star-driven escapism. The $98 million period piece was essentially <i>Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again </i>for dudes. That’s not a quality statement, as I will defend <i>Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again! </i>unto death while noting that moviegoers of all genders can and should enjoy boy movies.</p>
      <p><i>Ford v Ferrari</i> earned mostly strong reviews out of the festival circuit didn’t hurt, and that it was able to open this well even after the hype died down is a testament to both Fox/Disney’s marketing and the notion that online hype is a very different beast from general audience interest. Considering how weak the Oscar season has been, in terms of wide releases, thus far, this $31 million opening puts <i>Ford v Ferrari </i>near the front of the line almost by default. If we judge merely by seasonal releases that lots of folks have actually seen, at this point it’s Warner Bros.’ <i>Joker</i>, Roadside Attractions’ <i>Judy </i>and Focus Features’ <i>Harriet</i>. <i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, Bombshell, Richard Jewell, Little Women </i>and <i>1917 </i>are waiting in the wings.</p>
      <p>Moreover, while <i>Parasite </i>continues to make its case for a game-changing contender, <i>Jojo Rabbit </i>(Fox Searchlight) and <i>Ford v Ferrari </i>(Fox) will get pushes from Disney in order to show that Fox movies can still win Oscars under Disney. But for now, <i>Ford v Ferrari </i>was essentially Fox’s last hope to show that they can still get folks to the theaters for “Fox movies” under the Disney umbrella. It’s the hit Fox needed to prove itself to Disney, or the hit Disney needed to show that they could successfully sell a big Fox movie. Either win, it’s an unmitigated win. It’s a terrific studio programmer, exactly the kind of thing everyone complains that Hollywood no longer makes. So, it’s refreshing that, in this case, audiences somewhat showed up.</p>
      <p>Despite decent reviews and AARP-friendly movie stars (Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen), Bill Condon’s <i>The Good Liar </i>grossed just $5.65 million this weekend. It played 60% female and 64% 50-years-and-older. Yes, my wife and I were among the few “youngsters” in the theater last night, but I would have dug the hell out of this one just as much when I was in high school. The $10 million thriller, based on Nicholas Searle’s novel, joins the honored dead (<i>Blinded by the Light, The Kitchen, The Goldfinch</i>, etc.) among the Dream Factory’s slate of “movies that we say Hollywood never makes” that have played to empty auditoriums. At least <i>Joker </i>will be profitable enough to essentially make up for all of them, but that won’t help when WB is plotting out their theatrical future.</p>
