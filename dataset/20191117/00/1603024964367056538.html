      <h1>John Abraham's ‘Pagalpanti’ to take a route similar to his comedy hits Welcome Back and Housefull 2</h1>

      <p>After playing a series of intense roles one film after another, John Abraham is finally letting his hair down with <i>Pagalpanti</i>.</p>
      <p>For the actor, this Anees Bazmi-directed film could be a whiff of fresh air, considering the heavy duty drama that he has been a part of in films like <i>Batla House</i>, <i>Romeo Akbar Walter</i>, <i>Satyameva Jayate</i> and <i>Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran</i> to name a few.</p>
      <p>As has been the trend followed by Akshay Kumar as well, Abraham is mixing it up with an out and out fun-filled entertainer in the middle of films that carry a strong patriotic flavour.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Each of his last four releases have seen some degree of success at least, and barring <i>Romeo Akbar Walter</i>, which enjoyed just a fair run, the rest have been clean hits.</p>
      <p>However, taking a break from such films that required him to turn on the intensity, it is time for Abraham to loosen up with <i>Pagalpanti</i>.</p>
      <p>In fact, the film takes the actor into the same zone that made <i>Welcome Back</i> and <i>Housefull 2</i> major successes.</p>
      <p>It is similar to <i>Welcome Back</i> in terms of stage and setting as director Bazmee too is common. This is not all, as Anil Kapoor -- a regular in Welcome series -- returns to the fold too. The makers have not even tried to conceal the <i>Welcome</i> influence into the proceedings, with the theme music finding a place in <i>Pagalpanti</i> too.</p>
      <p>Abraham is not new to comedy though. His <i>Housefull 2</i> with Sajid Nadiadwala and Sajid Khan was a good success as well, with the film turning out to be the first Rs 100 crore club success for the actor. A multi-starrer, with regulars Akshay Kumar and Riteish Deshmukh, <i>Housefull 2</i> saw Abraham bringing on his comic timing all over again after <i>Garam Masala</i>. In that film too, he had Akshay Kumar for company.</p>
      <p>As for <i>Pagalpanti</i>, he has Arshad Warsi -- another supremely gifted comic actor for company. A common factor in <i>Golmaal</i> and <i>Dhamaal</i> series, Warsi is a huge asset to the film and if promos are any indication, there is good camaraderie on display between the two actors.</p>
      <p>As is the case with any good comedy, it is all about the timing, especially when the two actors are bouncing off on each other. In case of <i>Pagalpanti</i>, as the name suggests, there is a lot of madness on display and Abraham is expected to make the most of it.</p>
      <p>By the look of things, <i>Pagalpanti</i> could turn out to be another family entertainer success this year. As was seen recently, <i>Housefull 4</i> turned into a Rs 200 crore club success on the basis of audience word of mouth. Now Abraham and team would be hoping for the audience to give them a thumbs-up as well once <i>Pagalpanti</i> hits the screens on November 22.</p>
