      <p>I first encountered the task of writing a self-review as a young manager working in retail. It sucked, to say the least. I had to make sure my staff wrote these relatively detailed summaries of what they did on a monthly basis. It was an utter waste of time. I knew it. And worse, the employees writing them knew it.Flash forward to me serving in the military. A place that was highly driven by process and one of those processes included the dreaded performance review. My sergeant told me to come prepared with my self-review. He clarified in his very direct fashion, “I have fifty plus people to manage and I don’t have time to babysit you. Make sure you don’t waste my time.” Needless to say, I was none too thrilled with this guy, who to my impression, had watched, “Full Metal Jacket,” one too many times.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, when the review time rolled around, I showed up with a decent list of accomplishments. He proceeded to crumple up my self-review and toss it in the trash. He informed me that this wasn’t about proving how good I am. And what he said next changed performance reviews from a tedious waste of time to one of the most valuable tools I’ve had as a manager and a businessperson. He said, “These meetings and reviews are about us aligning on what really matters, learning from our decisions, tracking themes and figuring out the future together.” Well, hell. Someone should have told me that earlier.</p>
      <p>I’m here to tell you just that. Stop using self-reviews as a defense case for you and your status. Start using it to do the following:</p>
      <p>1.    <b>Drive Alignment. </b>This is really should be the sole purpose of reviews. It’s not about whether your manager approves of you as an employee. It’s about whether or not the two of you are on the same page. If they think the work you’re doing is more valuable than what you think it is, there is an issue. It’s as big of an issue as when they value your work less than you do. Bottom line, you are not aligned on what you deliver. This will definitely lead to challenges down the road.</p>
      <p>2.    <b>Ensure Year-Round Alignment.</b> Don’t wait till the end of year to make sure alignment is taken care of and discussed with your manager. I recently spoke with Michelle Armer, Chief People Officer of <a href="https://www.careerbuilder.com/?cbRecursionCnt=1">CareerBuilder</a>. She shared that more than 40% of companies only require a manager-employee review conversation at the end of the year. She advised, “Just because your company may only require an annual review, don’t let that prevent you from taking the initiative to engage your manager quarterly.” I couldn’t agree more. This will help you both look at the bigger picture, check how you both align and determine what changes need to be addressed ahead of time vs. waiting until it’s too late.</p>
      <p>Michelle went on to share, “Because so many employees wait until the end of year review to check on alignment, they can be surprised by the information they get in a review. They feel a lot of pressure to resolve that way.” She shared the tip that, “It’s okay to take some time and absorb the information and revisit it later. Get back to the ongoing conversation perspective. Not everything is expected to be wrapped up with a bow in just one hour. Don’t be afraid to ask for clarity and a follow up meeting.”</p>
      <p>3.    <b>Conduct a Performance Assessment.</b> Avoid the language that points to whether <i>you </i>are a good employee or not. This isn’t about you. This is about the work you deliver and the impact that work has on the business goals. That means statements such as, “I’m a high performer,” or “I’m not motivated enough,” really have no space in the assessment. Instead, refocus those statements to the work. “My approach to solving the XYZ challenge helped us deliver on our goals and keep the client onboard,” or, “The level of output from me, along with the multiple missed deadlines on this project are a direct result from the lack of focus I put on the work.”</p>
      <p>4.   <b>Demonstrate Self-Reflection. </b>The self-review should be a learning tool. It should be a space where you honestly reflect on your decisions. Look at what worked and why. Identify what didn’t work and why. From that, determine what you want to take into the next year and where you need to develop skill sets or familiarity. This isn’t about blame or defense. It’s about evolving your capabilities and how you work. </p>
      <p>5.  <b>Focus on Impact.</b> Most employees list all the things they did that year but miss the point. They don’t highlight the impact on the business. Finishing a project is not the result that matters. It’s what that project being finished enabled others to do or what it created for the business. This can be an impact on the bottom line, efficiencies, morale or customer engagement. But it has to reflect what happened after they took action.</p>
      <p>I’ve found the self-review to be a critical business tool that I’ve used religiously as a company employee, consultant and people manager. My advice is to drop this as a way to make HR or your manager happy with you. Instead, take charge and ownership of the work you do. Drive success through ongoing dialogue, reflection and informed decision making.</p>
