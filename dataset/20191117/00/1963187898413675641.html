      <p>CAIRO - 17 November 2019: Egypt has received positive international response, following submitting its Universal Periodic Review report on human rights, local media reported, except by Ankara, which has been known for hostile remarks against the Egyptian state. <br/><br/>This echos earlier reports saying that diplomatic responses to Egypt’s interactive dialogue on its human rights situation have reportedly thus far been positive at the UPR. <br/><br/>Egypt’s presentation was attended by many diplomatic and non-governmental delegations, as well as media outlets. <br/><br/>Only Turkey sent recommendation regarding the death of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, which is inconsistent with the statement issued by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, as only one state issued a recommendation on the issue, which indicates that its report was unprofessional and not based on facts. <br/><br/>Refuting doubts about the death of Morsi, Egyptian Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Omar Marwan has told AFP in an interview that Morsi's death took place naturally, during a trial. <br/><br/>“Morsi died in the courtroom in front of everybody,” Marawan told AFP, rejecting a statement issued last week by an independent panel of UN experts. <br/><br/>However, according to Marawan, the general prosecution is still investigating his death and will announce the results as soon as they are reached. <br/><br/>Morsi, who belonged to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, was overthrown after a year in power following a popular uprising. <br/><br/>A number of 14 countries demanded that Egypt abolish the death penalty, during the final communiqué to discuss the Universal Periodic Review report submitted by Egypt to the UN Human Rights Council on human rights situation in the African country, local media reported. <br/><br/>They also called for amending legislations in line with international human rights standards concerning the death penalty. <br/><br/>Some of the countries demanding abolishing the death penalty, called for a moratorium on the death penalty, with a view to cancelling it, in accordance with national legislation. <br/><br/>They also emphasized non-sentencing those who committed a crime deserving the death penalty when they were minors. <br/><br/>The member states also recommended stopping restricting the work of civil society organizations by amending legislation, especially the law on demonstrations, and called for strengthening mechanisms for dialogue and cooperation with NGOs. <br/><br/>They expressed concern over travel bans and asset freezes on civil society organizations, and demanded ending the foreign funding lawsuit no. 173. <br/><br/>Some countries also urged ensuring the right to sexuality and ending discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. <br/>  <br/>Egypt also received a demand by 10 countries to extend an open invitation to the special rapporteurs, especially those concerned with freedom of opinion and expression.</p>
