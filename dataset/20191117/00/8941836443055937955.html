      <p>SYDNEY (AP) - Black Eyed Peas musician will.i.am has accused a flight attendant from Australia’s national carrier <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/qantas/">Qantas</a> of being racist and rude to him on a flight.</p>
      <p>The musician says he was met by police at Sydney Airport on Saturday after an incident with an “overly aggressive flight attendant” who he says was upset with him because he couldn’t hear her through his noise-cancelling headphones.</p>
      <p>He tweeted a photo of a police officer and said: “This is how your greeted when you land from Brisbane to Sydney flying @<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/qantas/">qantas</a> with a #RacistFlightattendant.” He then named the flight attendant.</p>
