      <p>Motorists traversing the Trans-Canada or Highway 3 tonight should prepare for massive amounts of snow, Environment Canada says.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?bc20#223818271871526518201911150502ww1878cwvr">snowfall warning issued Saturday afternoon</a> calls for 20 to 30 centimetres of snow for Eagle Pass to Rogers Pass on Highway 1 and from Paulson Summit to Kootenay Pass on Highway 3. Snow will begin to fall Saturday night and continue into Sunday.</p>
      <p>Up to 30 centimetres is expected by later Sunday before the snow gives way to rain showers.</p>
      <p>"Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow," the statement reads. "Weather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions."</p>
      <p>Should visibility become an issue, drivers should turn on their lights and maintain a safe following distance.</p>
