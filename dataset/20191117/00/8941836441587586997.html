      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Los Angeles residents living near an oil drilling facility are calling for a review and urging new requirements for operating the site.</p>
      <p>The Los Angeles Times reports a legal settlement nearly two decades ago between the city and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/breitburn-energy/">Breitburn Energy</a> was meant to protect the neighborhood on Pico Boulevard from noise and fumes.</p>
      <p>The city’s deal with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/breitburn-energy/">Breitburn</a> included requirements meant to keep problems from recurring once the facility was renovated, but that has not happened.</p>
      <p>City officials say the operator did not take steps to initiate regular, five-year reviews and the city did not perform them.</p>
      <p>Neighbors have raised concerns in recent months about foul smells coming from the facility.</p>

      <p>The group Neighbors for a Safe Environment has asked for site upgrades including equipment to continuously track emissions.</p>
