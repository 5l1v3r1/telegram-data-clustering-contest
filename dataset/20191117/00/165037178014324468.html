        <b>Removed from management for almost 12 months, Jose Mourinho is reportedly targeting a return to the Premier League with Tottenham.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Could Jose Mourinho find a new home at a third Premier League club</b>?</p>
      <p>According to one report, the ex-Chelsea and Manchester United manager is keeping a close eye on Tottenham and the uncertainty that lingers over Mauricio Pochettino's future.</p>
      <p>The potential of a job opening in north London might even lead to him turning down a big-name former employer.</p>
      <p><b>Jose Mourinho </b>has told friends he is "<b>confident</b>" of being offered a return to <b>Real Madrid </b>but may hold out for the <b>Tottenham</b> job, according to The Sun.</p>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane is in his second stint in charge of Madrid, while Mauricio Pochettino has spent more than five years at the Spurs helm.</p>
      <p><b>The report suggests it is the latter position that Mourinho covets more</b>, meaning he "would not necessarily accept" another spell in the Spanish capital.</p>

        <b>ROUND-UP</b>
      </p>
      <p>- <b>Manchester United</b> could launch a January move for <b>Gareth Bale</b>, reports The Sun. According to the newspaper, Real Madrid know of United's interest in Wales winger Bale and would be happy to let him leave the Santiago Bernabeu, providing they can do a deal that involves <b>Paul Pogba</b> moving in the other direction.</p>
      <p>- Spanish outlet ElDesmarque reports news that could complicate any Bale-Pogba exchange, stating that although <b>Madrid </b>are indeed keen on France playmaker <b>Pogba</b>, so too are the player's former club <b>Juventus</b>, with Cristiano Ronaldo said to be supportive.</p>
      <p>- <b>Paris Saint-Germain</b> are rumoured to be United's strongest rivals for <b>Jadon Sancho</b> and the Ligue 1 side could make a surprise play for another England international. The Mirror claims PSG are interested in poaching Liverpool midfielder <b>Adam Lallana</b> on a free transfer. His contract is due to expire in 2020.</p>
      <p>- Premier League champions<b> Manchester City</b> will look to sign <b>Kingsley Coman</b> from Bayern Munich if <b>Leroy Sane</b> agrees on a move to the Bundesliga giants, according to Sky Sports. Coman, 23, joined Bayern from Juve in 2015, initially on loan.</p>
      <p>- <b>Mainz</b> are seeking a new head coach and the Bundesliga club are reported to be targeting former Cologne boss <b>Achim Beierlorzer</b>. Kicker reports Mainz want a new face in charge by early next week, and Beierlorzer is said to be in the frame. The club sit in the relegation zone after eight defeats in 11 games this term. Beierlorzer would be making a rapid return to bench duty if he lands the job, having left Cologne on November 9.</p>
