      <h3>Memphis Depay was “too young” during his time at Manchester United but he could now be ready for a return to the Premier League, according to Netherlands head coach Ronald Koeman.</h3>
      <p>The Netherlands international spent two years with Manchester United between 2015 and 2017 but only notched up 33 appearances for the Red Devils as he struggled to find consistent form.</p>
      <p>He moved to French side Lyon on the January transfer window in 2017 and he has scored an impressive 41 goals in 99 games for the Ligue 1 outfit.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11862245/koeman-depay-was-too-young-at-united">Sky Sports</a>, Depay is now being linked with a potential return to Old Trafford or a move to Premier League rivals Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p>And Netherlands boss Koeman feels that his stint at Manchester United probably came too soon for the attacker.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11862245/koeman-depay-was-too-young-at-united">Sky Sports</a>, Koeman said: “I think he’s a top player and maybe during his time at Manchester United he was a little bit too young.</p>
      <p>“He’s now more experienced and what he’s showed and what he has done for the national team is great and I’m really glad that we have that kind of player in our national team.”</p>
      <p>Manchester United are currently in seventh place in the Premier League table as they bid to try and break back into the top four this season.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils – who finished sixth and without a trophy last term – will return to Premier League action after the international break on Sunday when they travel to Sheffield United.</p>
