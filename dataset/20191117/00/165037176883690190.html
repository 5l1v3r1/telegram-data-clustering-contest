        <b>England buried the memory of Raheem Sterling's bust-up with Joe Gomez by beating Montenegro 7-0 and Kosovo 4-0.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Gareth Southgate</b> claimed<b> England</b> have <b>emerged stronger after working through the bust-up between</b> <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/r-sterling-106034/">Raheem Sterling</a> and <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/j-gomez-232599/">Joe Gomez</a> and ending their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign with emphatic victories.</p>
      <p>After being<b> left out of the squad </b>for England's 7-0 thrashing of Montenegro following his<b> behind-the-scenes clash with Gomez, </b>Sterling was restored to Southgate's side for their campaign-closing 4-0 victory over Kosovo and was<b> involved in goals scored</b> by Harry Kane and Marcus Rashford.</p>
      <p><b>Southgate praised the way his players pulled together</b> and indicated he is happy with the progress they are making with the European Championship seven months away.</p>
      <p>"You have to work through any difficulties you might have," Southgate told ITV. "The whole group have done that really well and <b>I think we've come out of this stronger than we started it, </b>quite frankly".</p>
      <p>"We're further ahead in being more settled in the group and the way we want to play and <b>players understanding our principles of play".</b></p>
      <p>"There is really good competition and <b>we wanted to learn a few things tonight</b>, that we certainly did."</p>

      <p>Harry Winks opened the scoring at Stadiumi Fadil Vokrri with his first international goal - a feat that was matched by second-half substitute Mason Mount, who scored in stoppage time.</p>
      <p><b>Winks admitted England's defensive lapses</b> allowed Kosovo to compete, while underlining his commitment to the team regardless of whether<b> Southgate plays him in a deep-lying role </b>or as an attacking midfielder.</p>
      <p><b>"I like to be able to play both positions,</b>" Winks said on ITV. "I consider myself someone who can be in that pivot [position] and be in that eight if needed as well".</p>
      <p>"There's<b> always moments we need to improve on</b>. It was the same in the Montenegro game, we gave away a few sloppy chances and we need to work on that because, come the Euros, <b>we'll come up against stronger opposition</b> than them and they might punish us."</p>
      <p>Kane, whose strike took his tally to <b>12 goals in qualifying,</b> echoed his Tottenham team-mate's comments, while reflecting upon England's strong finish to the game.</p>
      <p>"We went through a few spells where they had a bit of pressure," he told ITV. "But we soaked it up and towards the end, when the spaces started to open up,<b> it was clinical and 4-0 is a great result".</b></p>
      <p>"We know we can improve. Tonight was difficult: the pitch was poor and it was hard to play, and there's always going to be little mistakes.</p>
      <p>"When we play better teams <b>we've got to make sure we're on it."</b></p>
