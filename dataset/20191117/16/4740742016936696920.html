      <p>Bristol City striker Famara Diedhiou netted a hat-trick for Senegal this afternoon to help his nation to a 4-1 victory over Eswatini in the African Cup of Nations qualification match.</p>
      <p>It was an eventful game for Diedhiou who missed a penalty against the small nation of Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, but then netted his trio of goals in the space of just nine minutes to secure a comfortable victory.</p>
      <p>The striker was was also in action in midweek when Senegal faced Congo on Wednesday night. </p>
      <p>Diédhiou was named on the bench but was brought on in the 83rd-minute as his side went on to secure a 2-0 victory.</p>

      <p>The Robins forward has scored just four goals for Bristol City this season, netting three in the Championship and one in the EFL Cup.</p>
      <p>The striker scored on his last outing for Lee Johnson’s side to secure a 2-1 victory over Charlton Athletic but he also picked up a red card after kicking out at defender Jason Pearce, which has meant he has not featured since.</p>
      <p>That has left the Robins very short of striker options with summer loan signing Benik Afobe also out for the season with an anterior cruciate ligament injury and Matty Taylor on loan at League One side Oxford United.</p>
      <p>After earning an international recall Diedhiou has impressed for Senegal this season, scoring in the African nation’s 1-1 draw with Brazil back in October.</p>
      <p>Senegal are currently top of Pool C in the African Cup of Nations qualifiers, tied with Algeria on nine points, but their rivals have a game in hand tomorrow against Botswana.</p>
      <p>Diedhiou is now eligible for selection for Bristol City and will likely feature against Nottingham Forest next weekend.</p>
