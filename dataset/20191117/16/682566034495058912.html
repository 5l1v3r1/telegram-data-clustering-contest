      <p>Zagreb - World Cup runners-up <b>Croatia</b> rounded off a rebuilding mission by booking their place at <b>Euro 2020</b> with a 3-1 win over Slovakia but they are unlikely to sneak under the radar again at next year's finals.</p>
      <p>Croatia secured top spot in Group E, a section also including Hungary, Wales and Azerbaijan, with five wins and two draws from their eight qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Coach Zlatko Dalic, who masterminded the run to last year's World Cup final, has gradually reconstructed a squad that lost Mario Mandzukic, Danijel Subasic and Vedran Corluka to retirement in the wake of the 4-2 loss to France in Russia.</p>
      <p>The "Vatreni" - Croatian for "Fiery Ones" - needed only a point in Rijeka on Saturday to ensure a spot at the 24-team event, which kicks off in Rome on June 12.</p>
      <p>After a shocking start for home fans when Robert Bozenik scored in the 32th minute, Croatia's qualification was never in doubt once Nikola Vlasic drilled home the leveller in the second half.</p>
      <p>Bruno Petkovic headed the hosts in front and Ivan Perisic sealed the three points with a thumping finish with 16 minutes left.</p>
      <p>"I'm relieved ... proud and happy," Dalic said after the match.</p>
      <p>"These boys deserved the European Championship. This is the crowning moment for all that we have done in this year and a half since the World Cup."</p>
      <p>But the path through qualifying, preceded by a poor showing in the Nations League, where Croatia finished last in their group behind Spain and England, was far from plain sailing.</p>
      <p>Thumped 6-0 by Spain in their first competitive outing since the World Cup, Dalic spoke of the need for "fresh blood" to rejuvenate his side.</p>
      <p>Incorporating the likes of Petkovic, Josip Brekalo and Vlasic, Croatia began their qualifying bid with a difficult 2-1 victory against Azerbaijan at home in March.</p>
      <p>They slumped to a defeat by the same scoreline away to Hungary days later, but victory over Wales in June and a 4-0 win away to Slovakia rebuilt fragile confidence.</p>
      <p>A disappointing 1-1 draw in Azerbaijan was a setback but Croatia recovered to dismiss Hungary 3-0, before a point in Cardiff left them on the brink of qualification.</p>
      <p>For the former Yugoslav republic, independent since 1991, it is the sixth time it will play at the European Championship.</p>
      <p>"We are getting young players who today played like veterans. Vlasic and (Dino) Peric played superbly," Dalic said Saturday.</p>
      <p>Croatian papers Sunday echoed his view, praising the squad and Dalic who became just the second coach to take the country to two successive major tournaments.</p>
      <p>The legendary Miroslav Ciro Blazevic was the first, leading Croatia to the Euro '96 quarter-finals and a third-place finish at the 1998 World Cup in France.</p>
      <p>The nation of 4.2 million people reached the World Cup final last year for the first time, inspired by captain Luka Modric, but eventually fell to a heavily fancied France.</p>
      <p>"In a bit more than a year Croatia formed an excellent 'make up' and that is why we are looking forward to the European tournament," the Sportske Novosti daily commented Sunday.</p>
      <p>"Croatia will not be a 'dark horse' in summer 2020 but will be rather attacking from the front rows, which is both an advantage and a burden."</p>
