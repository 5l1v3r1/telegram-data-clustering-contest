      <p>A Denver talk-radio host was fired during his Saturday program after criticizing President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Craig Silverman hosted “The Craig Silverman Show,” which aired Saturday mornings on 710 KNUS, a conservative radio station. <a href="https://kdvr.com/2019/11/16/denver-talk-radio-host-craig-silverman-fired-mid-show-after-criticizing-trump/">Denver’s Fox 31</a> reported that Silverman was fired after airing a segment about Roy Cohn, a ruthless attorney who represented the Trump family in the 1970s but was disbarred for ethical violations.</p>
      <p>The outlet also noted that Silverman’s program was no longer listed on the station’s <a href="https://710knus.com/programguidedaily?dayOfWeek=Saturday&amp;amp;timeFilter=0">website</a>.</p>
      <p>In replying to a tweet of support, Silverman wrote online Saturday night that he rejected the “Trump party line.”</p>
      <p>“I cannot and will not toe strict Trump party line,” <a href="https://twitter.com/craigscolorado/status/1195783103643414528?s=20">Silverman wrote on Twitter</a>. “I call things as I see them. I see corruption and blatant dishonesty by President and his cronies. I also see bullying/smearing of American heroes w/courage to take oath and tell truth. Their bravery inspires me.”</p>
      <p>Joe Walsh, a longtime conservative figure who is mounting a 2020 primary challenge to Trump, wrote on Twitter that Silverman was “a great, honest voice on the radio” and that his firing was “pathetic.”</p>

      <p>The incident came one day after Silverman <a href="https://www.facebook.com/craigalansilverman">posted a Facebook status</a> praising <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-attacks-marie-yovanovitch-while-she-testifies-about-being-fired-2019-11">Marie Yovanovitch</a>, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, as “an American hero” for testifying in the impeachment hearings into Trump.</p>
      <p>Later in the post, he asked listeners to tune in to his show for “independent analysis of the most important events of our time” and “be prepared to be challenged.”</p>
      <p>Fox 31 reported that Silverman was scheduled to appear on CNN’s media-centric show “Reliable Sources” on Sunday morning.</p>
