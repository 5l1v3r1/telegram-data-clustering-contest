      <h1>Nebraska Linebacker Makes Bold Prediction For Next 2 Games</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:35:07+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Nebraska has no margin for error after yesterday’s 37-21 loss to Wisconsin. The Huskers have to win their last two games against Maryland and Iowa to reach bowl eligibility.</p>
      <p>Linebacker Mo Barry is confident that will happen. Despite the loss to the Badgers, Barry was encouraged by the way his teammates competed, considering it an improvement from previous games.</p>
      <p>After the game, Barry expressed those feelings and also predicted that Nebraska will win out to qualify for a bowl.</p>
      <blockquote>“We grew up in this game. It’s easy to say that we could’ve got destroyed by Wisconsin like everyone predicted. It’s easy to say that we could’ve just laid down and let No. 23 [Jonathan Taylor] just run down our throat and we didn’t,” Barry said at the end of his post-game press conference. “We competed. We could’ve won that game and we found a way to beat ourselves. These next two games, we’re going to compete just like that and we’re going to win them.”</blockquote>
      <p>You can watch Barry’s full post-game media session below.</p>
      <p>Maryland is 3-7 and has lost five games in a row, so the Huskers definitely have a chance to win next week, even though the game is on the road.</p>
      <p>Beating Iowa, however, will be tougher. Nebraska is at home for the regular season finale against the Hawkeyes, but will be the underdogs in the game.</p>
      <p>Also, the Huskers haven’t beaten Iowa since 2014 and are 1-5 against the Hawkeyes since joining the Big Ten.</p>
