      <h1>'A new Republican Star is born': Trump praises Elise Stefanik amid 'trashy' attacks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:33:48+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:33</time> by <a rel="author">Ellie Bufkin</a></address>
      <p>President Trump praised Republican New York Rep. Elise Stefanik after former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified before the House Intelligence Committee, of which Stefanik is a member.</p>
      <p>Stefanik made headlines Friday after several contentious exchanges with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff during the Yovanovitch testimony. Stefanik insisted to Schiff that she was being dismissed and denied time to question the witness, a choice Schiff defended as his constitutional right as chairman of the committee.</p>
      <p>"Will you be prohibiting witnesses from answering members' questions as you have in the closed-door depositions?" Stefanik questioned after being gavelled down during the testimony. Stefanik later expressed her concern on Twitter, noting the number of times she was passed over for questioning. "How many times can Adam Schiff say 'the Gentlewoman is NOT recognized'?" Stefanik questioned. "He clearly has NO interest in letting Republicans have any say in the impeachment hearings. Watch him interrupt us multiple times and refuse to yield for our parliamentary questions."</p>

      <p>After the hearing, many prominent Trump dissenters criticized Stefanik for her speaking time and insisted that she was in the wrong. Attorney George Conway <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/george-conway-under-fire-for-sharing-fake-photo-of-gop-congresswoman-and-calling-her-lying-trash">referred to Stefanik</a>, a 35-year-old three-term congresswoman, as "lying trash." Conway's sentiments were echoed by many liberal lawmakers and celebrities across social media, and #trashystefanik trended over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Trump came to her defense, saying, "A new Republican Star is born. Great going @EliseStefanik!"</p>
