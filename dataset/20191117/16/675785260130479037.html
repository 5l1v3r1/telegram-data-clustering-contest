      <h1>Where and when will England play their Euro 2020 matches? Fixture dates and stadiums</h1>
      <h2>The Three Lions have the bonus of a number of the tournaments' matches being held at Wembley, but they could face two different paths depending on their success</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/england-football-team">England's</a> path to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> has been confirmed, and with it promises another summer of excitement across the nation.</p>
      <p>Fans all over the country were gripped by the ventures of the Three Lions in Russia for the World Cup in 2018.</p>
      <p>And with Wembley one of the host stadiums for the European Championships, 2020 could be possibly one of the best tournaments in recent memory.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gareth-southgate">Gareth Southgate's</a> men have already secured their place, and only a miraculous 24-goal swing would see them miss out on top spot in qualifying Group A.</p>
      <p>But when will England's Euro 2020 matches be taking place? And where will they be held?</p>

      <p>Here are all the key dates for your diary...</p>
      <h3>Group stage</h3>
      <p>As England have sealed qualification, their group games will now all take place at Wembley, with England assigned to Group D.</p>
      <p>It's been over two decades since they last played a tournament fixture on home soil, with memories of Euro '96 almost faded.</p>
      <p>They'll kick-start they group campaign on June 14, before playing again on June 19 and June 23.</p>
      <p>June 14: Wembley</p>
      <p>June 19: Wembley</p>
      <p>June 23: Wembley</p>
      <h3>If England qualify as group winners</h3>
      <p>This is of course never a certainty with England, as even at the World Cup they went through as runners-up to Belgium.</p>
      <p>But should they progress from their group at the Euros as winners, they'll be handed a favourable run to the final.</p>
      <p>There's the potential for a last-16 clash over the Irish Sea in Ireland's capital of Dublin, while the quarter-final would take place in Rome.</p>
      <p>If they can repeat their World Cup form and make it to at least the last four, they'll return to Wembley for the semi's and - dare to believe - the final.</p>
      <p>Last-16: Aviva Stadium, Dublin</p>
      <p>Quarter-final: Stadio Olimpico, Rome</p>
      <p>Semi-final: Wembley</p>
      <p>Final: Wembley</p>
      <h3>If England finish second in the group</h3>
      <p>It's worth knowing these anyway, as... you know... England.</p>
      <p>So it would be the same set-up for the group stages, with all three games at Wembley, as well as returning for the semi's and final.</p>
      <p>But between would see England go on a slightly less than ideal journey to Copenhagen for the last-16, with a quarter-final scheduled for St. Petersburg in Russia.</p>
      <p>Last 16: Parken Stadium, Copenhagen</p>
      <p>Quarter-final: Krestovsky Stadium, St Petersburg</p>
      <p>Semi-final: Wembley</p>
      <p>Final: Wembley</p>
      <p>Either way, you can see the pints of beer flying now...</p>
