      <h1>Jordan Henderson's brilliant Roy Keane story as he reveals influence ex-Sunderland boss has on him</h1>
      <h2>Keane handed Henderson his first opportunity in the professional game while the pair were together at Sunderland</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sean McCormick</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson has revealed the positive influence Roy Keane has had on his career - reciting a typically abrasive Keane tale during their time together at Sunderland.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jordan-henderson">Henderson</a> is arguably Sunderland's greatest ever Academy product having gone on to captain his country, as well as leading Liverpool to Champions League glory earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old's professional football journey began in 2008 at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland,</a> though, when as an 18-year-old he was handed his opportunity by Black Cats manager, Keane.</p>
      <p>The former Manchester United captain was one of the most feared players in the game and he had made a successful start to life in management.</p>
      <p>Having guided Sunderland to promotion from the Championship during his first season in charge, the former Republic of Ireland international managed to avoid relegation from the Premier League the following year.</p>
      <p>Henderson had been impressing for Sunderland's youth team during that time and in the summer of 2008, he was handed the opportunity to impress for the first team.</p>
      <p>But that chance only arrived after a fierce encounter between <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane">Keane</a> and Sunderland's reserve team following a disappointing defeat at Gateshead.</p>
      <p>"It was a reserve game. We played Gateshead away and it was a pre-season thing," Henderson recalled while appearing on his former Liverpool team-mate <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hdWRpb2Jvb20uY29tL2NoYW5uZWxzLzUwMDUwMzYucnNz&amp;episode=dGFnOmF1ZGlvYm9vbS5jb20sMjAxOS0xMS0xMzovcG9zdHMvNzQyMzEyOQ&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;ved=2ahUKEwil5dn9_u7lAhWVlFwKHfaqAkQQieUEegQIARAE&amp;ep=6&amp;at=1573916271862">Jamie Carragher's new 'Greatest Game' podcast.</a></p>
      <p>"We were shocking, we got beat and Roy wasn't at the game. His coaching staff were there and he heard what had happened.</p>
      <p>"He got us back straight from the game to the Academy and we were all in the lounge area. We were all dotted about and he walked in and I was a young lad and I was sweating.</p>
      <p>"He started: 'This is your f*****g problem. Get together'.</p>
      <p>"So we all started shuffling together like a huddle and obviously he has some words to say and he is not happy. As we go off, some of the senior players, I remember David Meyler, one of my good mates, he had just signed for I can't remember how much it was.</p>
      <p>"He had a pop at him and he had a pop at a couple of others and then he pointed at me and went: 'Do you think you are good enough to play for the first team?'</p>
      <p>"Well after this rant I am thinking 'f*****g hell.' There is buckets I am sweating, all sorts coming off me.</p>
      <p>"I was a young lad and I looked up to Roy a lot as a player and as a manager and to be fair I went, 'yeah, I do'.</p>
      <p>"And I think he was bit like 'oh right, OK'. He was having that because he had heard that in the game I had still worked hard, I had still wanted it and he said 'good answer' and moved on.</p>

      <p>"I remember when he walked out everyone was like 'f*****g hell' and sweating, it was the Roy Keane effect.</p>
      <p>"After that game I got a phone call saying I was in the first-team squad for a pre-season game at the Stadium of Light and that was where it all started.</p>
      <p>"Obviously I was delighted, he was delighted with my reaction and it went from there."</p>
      <p>Keane left his role as Sunderland manager in 2009 but Henderson went on to establish himself as one of the Black Cats' key players under Steve Bruce, following a loan spell at Coventry.</p>
      <p>His form caught the eye of Liverpool and in 2011 he moved to Merseyside in a Â£16million deal. Henderson was brought to the club by Kenny Dalglish who was replaced by Brendan Rodgers after his first season at the club.</p>
      <p>After one season under Rodgers, it is well documented that Liverpool were happy to allow Henderson to join Fulham as part of a potential deal to bring former USA international Clint Dempsey to Anfield.</p>
      <p>Henderson chose to stay and was part of a Reds side that almost won the league in 2013/14. By the summer of 2015, Rodgers had appointed him as club captain.</p>
      <p>It was an incredible turnaround for Henderson, but one that Carragher revealed Keane had foreseen when the pair worked together for ITV's coverage of EURO 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.</p>
      <p>"Roy Keane is your manager but when you sign for Liverpool, you have impressed for Sunderland," begun Carragher.</p>
      <p>"But you sign for Liverpool and I actually did TV with Roy Keane in the summer of 2012 and you had already signed for Liverpool then.</p>
      <p>"I think it is fair to say that summer's signings all got put in the same hole together as in like 'Charlie Adam, Andy Carroll, Jordan Henderson, Stewart Downing, Doni was the goalkeeper'.</p>
      <p>"There was questions asked about Damien Comolli and I will never forget it. I had never met Roy Keane before and I was doing the TV with him and you are speaking about your club, and he said 'never, ever back against that lad, Jordan Henderson. He will be fine'.</p>
      <p>"It always stuck with me that. Obviously you played the same position and even I looked up to him. Manchester United captain, very successful and I thought 'that will do me'.</p>
      <p>"Was that the relationship you had with Keane, or does it surprise you that he would say that?"</p>
      <p>Henderson's response highlighted the influence Keane has had on his career - not only at Sunderland, but since joining Liverpool as well.</p>
      <p>"It will always surprise me because of how good he was as a player," he said.</p>
      <p>"He was one of the best midfielders ever to play in the Premier League so for someone like that to have confidence in me at a young age, all I wanted to do was go and impress him.</p>
      <p>"I think he could see how much I wanted to be a player, what it meant to me and what I was prepared to do to get there.</p>
      <p>"That is probably what gave him the confidence to put me in games. I made my debut at Chelsea when we were 3-0 down at half-time and he put me on, straight in the deep end, off you go.</p>
      <p>"Without those experiences, without Roy giving me the opportunity and doing that for me, I don't think I would be here today.</p>
      <p>"It gave me a lot of confidence because if Roy Keane thinks I have got something unique then that gives me a lot of confidence to go out and perform."</p>
