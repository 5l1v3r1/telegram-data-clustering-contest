        <h3>DRIVING THE DAY</h3>
        <p>Speaker <b>NANCY PELOSI </b>spoke this morning with <b>MARGARET BRENNAN </b>on <b>CBS NEWS’ “FACE THE NATION” </b>about everything from Trump’s tweets to when the inquiry will be finished to whether the government will shutdown. While all signs indicated that Democrats would move in mid-December to vote on impeachment, Pelosi was noncommittal and said “maybe they have more hearings” and that she has to work with all six chairmen to decide how Democrats will proceed.</p>
        <p>
          <b>THE HIGHLIGHTS:</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>-- ON WITNESS INTIMIDATION: BRENNAN: </b>“Do you think that was witness intimidation in your book?”<b> PELOSI: </b>“I haven't had a lot of time to pay attention to the president's tweets and the legal implications of them. I just think that was totally wrong and inappropriate and typical of the president.”</p>
        <p><b>-- ON WHEN IMPEACHMENT WILL BE WRAPPED UP: BRENNAN: </b>“Do you expect that to be wrapped up before the end of the year?” <b>PELOSI:</b> “I have no idea. Again, I …” <b>BRENNAN: </b>“No timetable for that?”<b> PELOSI:</b> “No, I mean, it is self-evident that we have open hearings for the next week. I don't know if there are any beyond that. Then we're out for Thanksgiving. Doesn't mean depositions couldn't be taken during that time. And then when we come back by then, maybe a decision or maybe they have more hearings. And then I have six committees who have been working on all of this, and those six chairmen have been very involved in what the, how we will proceed.”</p>
        <p><b>-- ON TRUMP INNOCENCE: BRENNAN: </b>“Well, you point out factually, right, that vote has not taken place to proceed necessarily with impeachment. But do you think you'll go through all of this and not vote to impeach the president?” <b>PELOSI: </b>“The fact [is] if the president has information that demonstrates his innocence in all of this, which we haven't seen. … If he has information that is exculpatory, that means ex, taking away, culpable, blame, then we look forward to seeing it.”</p>
        <p><b>-- ON A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN: BRENNAN:</b> “Are you confident you can avoid one?” <b>PELOSI: </b>“Well, let us hope left to their own devices, the appropriators can avoid that.” <b>BRENNAN:</b> “Does that mean Democrats will provide funding for the border wall?” <b>PELOSI:</b> “No, no. That's-we have well over a trillion dollars worth of decisions to make. I don't know why we would go to that. The president hasn't built any new wall in a whole term of office. I think that his comments about the wall are really an applause line at a rally, but they're not anything that he's serious about.”</p>
        <p><b>BRENNAN</b> spoke with <b>REP. JIM JORDAN</b> (R-Ohio) after the Pelosi interview: <b>BRENNAN:</b> “As you heard from the speaker in that interview, she argues that the aid to Ukraine was only released because of the whistleblower. What reason were you given that the aid to Ukraine … was eventually released?</p>
        <p><b>JORDAN:</b> “Because President Zelensky met five times with senior U.S. officials. One, of course, was the phone call with President Trump. And then four meetings, actually face to face meetings, with U.S. senators, ambassadors, with Vice President Pence. And in each of those meetings, never was it talked about linking the security assistance dollars to any type of investigations.</p>
        <p><b>“But what did happen in those meetings</b> is they all became convinced Zelensky’s the real deal. Remember, we're talking about Ukraine. One of the three most corrupt countries on the planet. And we're talking about the hard earned tax dollars of the American people. So, they became convinced that this media star, this new guy to politics, his party just won an overwhelming majority in their parliament, was the real deal. And he was legit and he was worth the risk … and they said we’ll release the aid.”</p>
        <p><b>ABOUT LAST NIGHT … ALEX ISENSTADT: “Louisiana delivers Trump a black eye”: </b>“President Donald Trump campaigned hard in three conservative Southern states this fall, aiming for a string of gubernatorial wins that would demonstrate his political strength heading into impeachment and his own reelection effort. The plan backfired in dramatic fashion.</p>
        <p><b>“The latest black eye came on Saturday, </b>when Trump's favored candidate in Louisiana, multimillionaire businessman Eddie Rispone, went down to defeat. The president went all-in, visiting the state three times, most recently on Thursday. Earlier this month, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin lost reelection after a similar presidential effort on his behalf. Of the candidates Trump backed, only Tate Reeves in Mississippi won.</p>
        <p><b>“The losses raise questions about Trump’s standing </b>as he heads into what will be a grueling 2020 campaign. By throwing himself into the three contests — each in states that Trump won by double-digits in 2016 — the president had hoped to gain a modicum of political momentum at a perilous moment of his presidency.</p>
        <p><b>“Those close to the president argue that he can’t be faulted </b>for the Kentucky and Louisiana outcomes. Bevin was one of the country’s least popular governors, while Rispone was a relatively unknown political newcomer who was facing a popular incumbent in Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. While the president can help, they contend, he can’t always be expected to pull flawed candidates over the finish line.” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/17/trump-suffers-louisiana-loss-071300"><u>POLITICO</u></a> … <b><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/16/louisiana-governor-race-edwards-rispone-071288"><i>More from Daniel Strauss</i></a></b></p>
        <p><b>-- CHRIS WALLACE </b>spoke with House Minority Whip <b>STEVE SCALISE </b>(R-La.) on <b>FOX NEWS’ “FOX NEWS SUNDAY”</b> about the Republican loss: <b>WALLACE: </b>“You had an election yesterday in Louisiana and the Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, was reelected. President Trump was in there campaigning hard, multiple times, and said look, if Eddie Rispone, the Republican doesn't win it's going to make me, Trump, look bad because I don't have any coattails. Does it make him look bad?</p>
        <p><b>SCALISE: </b>“What he said was he'd be made to look bad whether he came in the state or not. Eddie Rispone made up about a 22-point disadvantage over the last month because of President Trump's involvement. So, Eddie Rispone was at about 27 in the primary. He ended up at 49. So clearly President Trump's involvement made a big difference at helping close that massive gap and look, the governor's polling showed he was above 50 before President Trump first started getting involved. That forced a runoff.”</p>
        <p><b>Good Sunday morning. NEW … THE PRESIDENT’S WEEK AHEAD: TUESDAY: </b>The president will hold a Cabinet meeting and have lunch with VP Mike Pence. <b>WEDNESDAY: </b>Trump will visit the Apple manufacturing plant in Austin. <b>THURSDAY: </b>Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will present the National Medal of Arts and the National Humanities Medal. <b>FRIDAY: </b>The president will participate in the NCAA Collegiate National Champions Day.</p>
        <p><b>TRUMP BECOMES A BIDEN DEFENDER? -- @realPresidentTrump </b>at 9:58 a.m.: “Mr. Chairman, Joe Biden may be Sleepy and Very Slow, but he is not a “rabid dog.” He is actually somewhat better than that, but I am the only one who can get you where you have to be. You should act quickly, get the deal done. See you soon!”</p>
        <p><b>SUNDAY BEST … CHUCK TODD </b>spoke with <b>SEN. CHRIS MURPHY</b> on <b>NBC’S “MEET THE PRESS” </b>about impeachment: <b>MURPHY: </b>“And if there were no consequences, then the message would be clear, that this president, and any other president, can use the power of the oval office in order to try to advance themselves politically or financially, and so I think Representative Schiff is right. If you don’t use impeachment for this type of offense, then I am not sure what you use it for.”</p>
        <p><b>-- MURPHY </b>also spoke to <b>JAKE</b> <b>TAPPER </b>on <b>CNN’S “STATE OF THE UNION” </b>about Ambassador Gordon Sonland: “Mr. Sondland has to decide whether his primary loyalty is to America or whether his primary loyalty is to the president of the United States because it seems clear that he was in fact talking pretty regularly, potentially, with the president directly. And if that were the case then he needs to explain that. Ultimately this is about his legacy. And if it comes out that he misled the committee in his initial testimony or outright lied there are real consequences for him down the line.”</p>
        <p><b>-- TAPPER </b>also interviewed <b>REP. MIKE TURNER </b>(R-Ohio): <b>TAPPER: </b>“Does it concern you at all that a witness found what President Trump tweeted to be intimidating?” <b>TURNER:</b> “Well, I mean, Jake, I think, along with most people, I find the president's tweets generally unfortunate. … It's certainly not impeachable, and it's certainly not criminal, and it's certainly not witness intimidation. It certainly wasn't trying to prevent her or would it have prevented her from testifying. She was actually in the process of testifying.”</p>
        <p><b>-- ON FOX NEWS: “Steve Scalise: Trump's military pardons boost troop morale,” </b>by Evan Semones: “House Minority Whip Steve Scalise on Sunday voiced his support for President Donald Trump’s pardons of two Army officers who were accused of war crimes, arguing the move boosts morale in the military.” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/17/steve-scalise-trump-military-pardon-071306"><u>POLITICO</u></a></p>

          <b>THE LATEST ON IMPEACHMENT …</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>-- “Pence aide testified that Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine were 'inappropriate',” </b>by Andrew Desiderio and Melanie Zanona: “A top national security aide to Vice President Mike Pence told House impeachment investigators that President Donald Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political opponents were ‘unusual and inappropriate,’ and ‘shed some light on possible other motivations’ for the president’s order to freeze military aid to the U.S. ally.</p>
        <p><b>“Jennifer Williams, who serves as Pence’s special adviser </b>for Europe and Russia, told investigators in early November that she took notes while she listened in on Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from the White House Situation Room, adding that she viewed Trump’s requests for investigations as politically motivated.” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/16/pence-aide-testified-that-trumps-efforts-to-pressure-ukraine-were-inappropriate-071282"><u>POLITICO</u></a></p>
        <p><b>-- “Sondland said he was acting on Trump’s orders, aide told investigators,” </b>by Kyle Cheney and Blake Hounshell: “Tim Morrison, a top White House national security aide, told impeachment investigators that Gordon Sondland — a U.S. ambassador at the center of the Ukraine scandal imperiling Donald Trump’s presidency — claimed to be acting on Trump’s orders, and in fact was regularly in touch with him.</p>
        <p><b>“Though other impeachment witnesses</b> have suggested Sondland has overstating his relationship with the president, Morrison said he was repeatedly able to confirm that the envoy did speak directly with the Trump. ‘Every time you went to check to see whether he had, in fact, talked to the president, you found that he had talked to the president?’ one lawmaker wondered, according to a transcript of Morrison’s testimony released Saturday. ‘Yes,’ Morrison replied.</p>
        <p><b>“Sondland’s direct access to Trump is a crucial aspect</b> of the House’s impeachment inquiry. Officially the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, he played an unofficial role in channeling and conveying the president’s demands of Ukrainian leaders.” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/16/sondland-said-he-was-acting-on-trumps-orders-aide-told-investigators-071275"><u>POLITICO</u></a></p>

        <p><b>THE PRESIDENT’S DEFENDERS: “Giuliani: Democratic investigation ‘a travesty’,” </b>by David Cohen: “Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, tweeted early Sunday that the House investigation into President Donald Trump is ‘a travesty.’ After 3 witnesses no evidence has been presented of any offense. The first two permanent diplomats had no direct knowledge just overhearing things. The third one had no knowledge not even hearsay. This is a travesty,’ he tweeted.” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/17/rudy-giuliani-impeachment-evidence-071302"><u>POLITICO</u></a></p>
        <p><b>-- GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS </b>spoke with <b>REP. CHRIS STEWART </b>(R-Utah) on <b>ABC’S “THIS WEEK”: STEPHANOPOLOUS: </b>“The evidence is building about the campaign to trade military aid and a White House meeting to investigations directly to President Trump. It's tied directly now to President Trump, isn't it?”</p>
        <p><b>STEWART: </b>“I disagree with you, George. I don't think the evidence is building at all. And I'm being sincere in this, I think the evidence is crumbling. I think the Democrats know they're in trouble on this, which is why we keep moving the goalposts. We went from some supposed quid pro quo, and as you said tying these investigations to withholding military aid, but we know that didn't happen.</p>
        <p><b>“And now Mrs. Pelosi comes and says,</b> well, we're going to impeach and remove the president for bribery, but, you know, we didn't play this clip where I asked the ambassador if you have any evidence at all the president committed bribery or was involved with that. She said no. Do you have any evidence at all that the president did anything criminal or illegal? And the answer is no. And, again, I think the longer this hearing goes on I think the less the American are going to support impeachment, I think the evidence just doesn't support it.”</p>
        <p><b>-- NYT’S CATIE EDMONSON: </b>“Some of the nation’s leading conservative groups — the Club For Growth, FreedomWorks, Citizens United, and Tea Party Patriots — have locked arms to serve as an unofficial war room for the president during the impeachment inquiry, the third such proceeding in modern history, but the first of the social media age.</p>
        <p><b>“The coalition of more than 100 organizations,</b> including traditional conservative fund-raisers and public relations firms, is banking on a coordinated divide-and-conquer strategy that seeks to harness its grass-roots networks’ outrage — and raise money crucial to its own survival.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/16/us/politics/conservative-groups-impeachment-trump.html"><u>NYT</u></a></p>

The appointment was not on the president’s schedule, in contrast to a previous physical that Mr. Trump had in February, also at Walter Reed outside Washington.</p>
        <p><b>“In a statement, Stephanie Grisham, </b>the White House press secretary, said Mr. Trump, 73, was taking advantage of a free weekend to begin portions of his annual physical, and was anticipating a busy schedule in 2020. She did not specify what types of tests Mr. Trump had.</p>
        <p>‘The president remains healthy and energetic without complaints, as demonstrated by his repeated vigorous rally performances in front of thousands of Americans several times a week,’ Ms. Grisham said.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/us/politics/-trump-annual-physical.html"><u>NYT</u></a></p>

        <p><b>-- “CBS News Battleground Tracker: Buttigieg rises in Iowa and New Hampshire, Biden back atop delegate hunt,”</b> by Anthony Salvanto, Jennifer De Pinto, Kabir Khanna and Fred Backus: “The Democratic nomination race remains unsettled because many voters are conflicted between what they want and whether they think can win. Some candidates who generate excitement are also seen as risky. Progressive policies are popular but might be too liberal to win swing voters. And while voters say they are satisfied with their current selection of candidates, very few have actually settled on one.</p>

        <p><b>“Since September, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points </b>among Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers, with 25% now saying he is their first choice for president.

        <p><b>“Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, </b>led the September Iowa Poll, when 22% said she was their first choice. In this poll, her support slips to 16%.

          <p><b>BRYAN BENDER, WES MORGAN </b>and <b>DANIEL LIPPMAN: “Trump’s ‘West Point Mafia’ Faces a Loyalty Test”: </b>“On May 28, 1986, newly commissioned 2nd Lt. Michael Pompeo stood at attention in Michie Stadium at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, first in his class. The career he was about to launch would take him from commanding a tank platoon in Germany to a seat in Congress, and ultimately to the right hand of President Donald Trump as secretary of State.</p>
          <p><b>“Also on the field that day was classmate Mark Esper,</b> who this July landed right next to Pompeo in Trump’s Cabinet, confirmed as secretary of Defense. Their West Point classmates Ulrich Brechbuhl and Brian Bulatao also hold senior State Department posts as Pompeo’s top lieutenants, while at the other end of the National Mall, inside the Capitol, classmate Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee has emerged as one of Trump’s leading defenders on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.</p>
          <p><b>“Thanks in part to Trump’s fixation on appointing</b> current and former military officers to key posts, and in part to his tendency to take advice from a small circle of advisers, the West Point class of 1986 has grown into a profoundly influential cohort in American foreign and military policy. In the annals of the military service academies, its rise to the top puts it on a par with the class of 1915, which bred the commanders of World War II and a U.S. president.</p>
          <p><b>“The link that brought them into Trumpworld </b>is David Urban, the lobbyist, CNN commentator and Trump confidant—and another member of the West Point class of ‘86—whose support of his fellow cadets helped Pompeo and Esper land their Cabinet posts.” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2019/11/17/west-point-alumni-pompeo-esper-state-department-071212"><u>POLITICO</u></a></p>
