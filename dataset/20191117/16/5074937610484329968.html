      <h1>Religious leaders urged to be ambassadors/agents of Road Safety</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:41:03+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:41</time> by <a rel="author">Victoria Agyemang, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Cape Coast, Nov.17, GNA - The National Road Safety Authority (NRSA) has called on religious leaders to be agents of road safety in their respective places of worship to reduce accidents.</p>
      <p>Religious leaders including pastors, imams and traditional authorities have critical roles to play to ensure safety on the roads, it said.</p>
      <p>Mr Victor Kojo Bilson, the Acting Regional Head of NRSC, made the call when the Authority educated leaders and members of the Cape Coast branch of the International Central Gospel Church (ICGC) on Sunday.</p>
      <p>It forms part of activities to mark the World Remembrance Day for Road Traffic Victims on the theme: "Life is not a car Part" to intensify the sensitisation drive on Road Safety.</p>
      <p>Mr Bilson, who took the congregation through some road and traffic signs, symbols and regulations, stated that all road users must adhere to the rules.</p>
      <p>He said religious leaders must use their influence to preach safety and educate their members on the importance of complying with road safety regulations.</p>
      <p>He said human errors such as carelessness, overloading, disregard for safety regulations, excessive speeding and drink driving were major causes of road crashes in the Region leading to loss of lives.</p>
      <p>The situation should be tackled collectively to prevent the possibility of losing more breadwinners and energetic human resources, he said, and advised the congregation to employ defensive driving techniques.</p>
      <p>He urged motor riders to use their crash helmets always to avoid fatalities whenever there was an accident.</p>
      <p>Reverend Reuben Kwabla Obeng, the Head Pastor, commended the Authority for extending the educational campaign to the church and encouraged the congregation to apply the knowledge acquired to help reduce road crashes.</p>
