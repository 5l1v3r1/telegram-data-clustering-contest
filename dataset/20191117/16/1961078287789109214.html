      <h1>Syracuse University Suspends Fraternity Activities After Racist Incident</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:58:44+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:58</time> by <a rel="author">Luis Ferré-Sadurní</a></address>
      <p>Syracuse University suspended all social activities at fraternities for the rest of the year on Sunday, following a string of racist and anti-Semitic incidents that have riled students on campus, prompting protests, boycotts and sit-ins.</p>
      <p>Several times this month, campus buildings have been vandalized with racial slurs targeting black and Asian people, leading Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/news/2019/11/gov-cuomo-calls-for-investigation-after-racial-slurs-found-on-syracuse-university-dorm-bathrooms.html">to direct state agencies</a> to investigate the hate speech.</p>
      <p>Sunday’s announcement came after a group of students, including members of a fraternity, accosted an African-American student on Saturday night, using a racial slur. The university has identified the students involved in the altercation, which was caught on video, and suspended the fraternity. The school said it would continue to investigate the incident and would discipline the students to the “full extent of the law.”</p>
      <p>“While only one fraternity may have been involved in this particular incident, given recent history, all fraternities must come together with the University community to reflect upon how to prevent recurrence of such seriously troubling behavior,” Kent Syverud, the university’s chancellor, <a href="https://chancellor.syr.edu/archives/public-remarks/">said in a statement</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Mr. Syverud also said that a university donor had offered a reward for any evidence that led to the apprehension of those involved.</p>
      <p>Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/nyregion/syracuse-fraternity-suspended.html?module=inline">15 students from the fraternity Theta Tau were suspended</a> after a fraternity video surfaced that Mr. Syverud described at the time as “racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, sexist and hostile to people with disabilities.”</p>
