      <h1>Manchester United official on transfer trip in Spain – South American possibly on agenda</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:33:32+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/sean-lunt/" target="_blank">Sean Lunt</a></address>
      <p>With Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at the helm, Manchester United’s transfer strategy has become one even more focused on youth.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer wants the club to secure the next young talent the world over, something that we saw with the signings of Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka in the summer.</p>
      <p>Such a strategy requires them to scout talent the world over, and it seems this week they’re taking a look at South American talent.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.record.pt/">Record</a> report that Manchester United are one of several clubs who are in Spain, specifically Gran Canaria, to watch the Tenerife Tournament.</p>
      <p>The event has been set up to help teams, in this case, Brazil, Chile, Argentina and USA, to prepare for the 2020 CONMEBOL Pre-Olympic Tournament.</p>
      <p>Several big teams have all turned up to rule their eye over the young players on show and Manchester United are one of them.</p>

      <p>The newspaper makes no mention of whether United are there to scout any player in particular, although there’s likely to be plenty on offer with Brazil and Argentine both there.</p>
      <p>They suggest that’s probably why everyone is there. Accreditation for the tournament was free, so it seems the big clubs couldn’t resist the offer.</p>
