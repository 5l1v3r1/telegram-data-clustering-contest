      <p>Evidence of British war crimes against children and civilians was covered up by military commanders, according to an investigation.</p>
      <p>Leaked files kept secret by the government contain evidence of the killings and torture of innocent detainees by UK troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, according to BBC Panorama and The Sunday Times.</p>
      <p>The year-long investigation claims 11 British military detectives uncovered claims of senior officers falsifying documents serious enough that they should be prosecuted.</p>
      <p>Evidence of murders by an SAS soldier and deaths in custody, beatings, torture and sexual abuse of detainees by members of Scotland’s Black Watch regiment was allegedly discovered.</p>
      <p>One of the SAS’s highest ranked commanders is said to have been referred to prosecutors for attempting to pervert the course of justice, the investigation claims.</p>

      <p>The claims surfaced during two war crimes inquiries, Operation Northmoor for Afghanistan and the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT).</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>One of the cases reviewed for the investigation was the shooting of an Iraqi policeman in an alleyway by a British soldier on patrol in Basra in 2003.</p>
      <p>The soldier’s commanding officer concluded the shooting was a lawful case of self-defence because the policeman had fired first.</p>
      <p>Maj Christopher Suss-Francksen’s report said another British infantryman who witnessed the shooting first-hand confirmed the Iraqi had fired first.</p>
      <p>But IHAT detectives spent two years investigating the case and interviewing 80 British soldiers, and claim they were told by the same infantryman he had not been in the alleyway and only heard one shot.</p>
      <p>In his statement to the inquiry he said: ‘This report is inaccurate and gives the impression that I was an eyewitness. This is not true.’</p>
      <p>Other witnesses also said they heard only one shot and detectives concluded the soldier who fired the shot and his commanding officer should be prosecuted.</p>

      <p>Another case involves three Afghan children and one man <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/war-crimes-scandal-as-they-drank-tea-the-afghan-boys-were-shot-in-the-head-and-blood-filled-their-cups-2lh58bxw8">allegedly shot at close range</a> while drinking tea in their home in 2012 by an SAS soldier.</p>
      <p>Then-defence secretary Michael Fallon closed the probes in 2017 before they reached trial after Phil Shiner, a solicitor who had taken over a thousand cases to IHAT, was struck off from practising law amid claims he paid people in Iraq to find clients.</p>
      <p>But some former investigators for the inquiries accused the government of using Mr Shiner’s behaviour as an excuse to close them down.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>An IHAT detective told Panorama: ‘The Ministry of Defence had no intention of prosecuting any soldier of whatever rank he was unless it was absolutely necessary, and they couldn’t wriggle their way out of it.’</p>
      <p>Another branded the handling of the probes as ‘disgusting’. They said: ‘I feel for the families because they’re not getting justice. How can you hold your head up as a British person?’</p>

      <p>Lord Macdonald, a former director of public prosecutions, told The Sunday Times: ‘It’s absolutely reprehensible for politicians to take it upon themselves to interfere in investigations into crimes this serious, and to close those investigations down before they’re complete.’</p>
      <p>The revelations could pave the way for an investigation of British forces by the International Criminal Court, which upholds the Geneva conventions on war crimes and torture.</p>
      <p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC that ‘all of the allegations, that had evidence, have been looked at’ and ‘the right balance’ had been struck over decisions on whether to investigate claims.</p>
      <p>A Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesperson said: ‘Allegations that the MoD interfered with investigations or prosecution decisions relating to the conduct of UK forces in Iraq and Afghanistan are untrue.’</p>
      <p>‘Throughout the process the decisions of prosecutors and the investigators have been independent of the MoD and involved external oversight and legal advice.’</p>

      <p>Cases were referred to the independent Service Prosecuting Authority (SPA) as a result of inquiries in Iraq and Afghanistan, the MoD added.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>They said: ‘It is untrue to claim cases investigated under Operation Northmoor in Afghanistan were not acted upon. After careful investigation, overseen by a former chief constable, no Northmoor cases were referred to prosecutors.’</p>
      <p>It also said Service Police undertook wide-ranging investigations into UK forces’ conduct and the SPA decided not to prosecute any of the cases referred to it.</p>
      <p>The claims have been passed to the Service Police and the Service Prosecuting Authority ‘who remain open to considering allegations’, the MoD said.</p>
