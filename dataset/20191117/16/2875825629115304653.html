      <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo's claim over what he would have achieved if he was Brazilian</h1>
      <h2>The 34-year-old has won two major trophies for Portugal and been runner-up in another tournament, while he remains their all-time top scorer needing just one goal to reach 100</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo's</a> ego often knows no bounds.</p>
      <p>And the Portuguese striker has made another outrageous claim to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> teammate <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/danilo">Danilo</a> , that "Brazil would've won another five World Cups" by now, had he been eligible to play for them.</p>
      <p>The comment was clearly made tongue-in-cheek, given Ronaldo would have had to have been involved in every World Cup tournament since the 1998 finals in order to achieve the feat.</p>
      <p>But few could argue he wouldn't have collected more winners medals with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/brazil-football-team">Brazil</a> , who have reached the quarter-finals three times since their last win in 2002, as well as a fourth-place finish on home soil in 2014.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo has had some success on the international stage, after captaining <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/portugal-football-team">Portugal</a> to victory in the 2016 European Championships, having reached the same final in 2004, as well as winning the UEFA Nations League in the summer.</p>

      <p>He also stands on the brink of breaking the 100-goal barrier for his country, and Danilo admitted he was happy that, at least in club football, they were on the same side.</p>
      <p>“I knew him from our time at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and it was nice to be back with him at Juve,” Danilo told <a href="https://www.football-italia.net/146532/danilo-if-ronaldo-was-brazilian">Football Italia</a> .</p>
      <p>“Along with his great quality, Ronaldo has this attention for detail that really explains the results he has achieved. He even told me that, if he had played for Brazil, we would’ve won another five World Cups already.”</p>
      <p>Ronaldo was on target again for Portugal in their 2-0 win over Luxembourg to take his international tally to 99.</p>
      <p>But his goal came in controversial fashion, as he poked the ball over the line in the 86th minute when it was already on its way in from Diogo Jota's strike.</p>
      <p>Portugal qualified for next summer's finals where they will defend their trophy after coming second in qualifying Group B to Ukraine.</p>
