        <b>Ariana Grande honoured her dog the best way she knew how, by getting brand new tattoos.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 7 Rings singer took to her Instagram story to show off the art pieces that cover her entire hand and we are in love with it.</p>
      <p>The first piece is the name of one of the 26-year-old’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dogs/">dogs</a>, Toulouse, written in cursive beneath her knuckles.</p>
      <p>Her second new tat has leaves and the planet Saturn covering the rest of her hand.</p>
      <p>‘Newest addition to my glove,’ Ariana captioned the story, captioning her go-to artist Mira Mariah.</p>
      <p>If this is just the beginning of her ‘glove’ process, we can’t wait to see what other tiny doodles she adds to her collection.</p>
      <p>She has already accumulated over 30 pieces (that we know of) of tattoos, and one of them is the famed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/31/ariana-grande-tried-fix-bbq-grill-hand-tattoo-failed-miserably-8422196/">‘small BBQ grill finger’</a> that we can’t seem to forget about.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/ariana-grande-warns-fans-may-cancel-tour-shows-much-pain-amid-health-battles-11169125/">Ariana revealed she may be forced to cancel more shows</a> in the last leg of her Sweetener tour as she struggles over her health.</p>
      <p>The star took to Instagram to warn fans that her head was really ‘splitting’ during her last concert, in Charlottesville, and is hoping to get better for the next show.</p>
      <p>However, in a lengthy statement shared with her 167 million followers, she warned that her upcoming performances may be called off on doctor’s orders.</p>
      <p>‘Hi my loves,’ the Thank U, Next singer began. ‘So I’m still very sick. I’ve been sick since the last London show. I don’t know how it’s possible but my throat and head are still in so much pain.</p>

      <p>‘I sound okay I’m just in a lot of pain and it’s difficult to breathe during the show. I am seeing my doctor and trying my v vest to get better for tomorrow’s show.</p>
      <p>‘The last thing I would ever want to do is cancel a show at this point with so few left.</p>
      <p>‘I’m truly cherishing every moment of this… I just really don’t know what’s happening with my body right now and need to figure it out.’</p>

      <p>‘Please take this as a gentle heads up…,’ she continued. ‘I don’t want anyone to feel blindsided tomorrow if God forbid I can’t make the show happen.</p>
      <p>‘I’m on all the meds. Getting IV drips, doing everything I possibly can to pull through. Mum and friends are taking good care of me. Just a scary feeling.’</p>
