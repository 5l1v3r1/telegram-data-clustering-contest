      <h2>Slow lorises, Indian star tortoise, soft shell turtle rescued</h2>

      <p>Hyderabad police, along with Forest department officials, rescued four slow lorises, an Indian star tortoise and a soft shell turtle, after arresting a 55-year-old man from Barkas for illegal trade of the animals classified endangered under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.</p>
      <p>Acting on a tip-off, a team of Commissioner’s Task Force (south zone) led by inspector S. Raghavendra conducted a raid on the residence of Saleh Bin Mahammed Badam at Barkas in Chandrayangutta here, rescued the animals and apprehended him. Saleh’s younger brother Ali Bin Mahammed Badam is at large.</p>
      <p>The duo own a pharmacy store and got into the illegal trade of animals to make a fast buck, said Mr. Raghavendra, adding that the animals command good demand in the State capital. “Ali was procuring animals from one of his friends at a low price and making a lucrative deal by selling them to customers in Hyderabad,” said Additional DCP (Task Force) Chakravarthy Gummi.</p>
      <p>Saleh, along with the rescued animals, was handed over to Forest department officials for further probe.</p>
      <p>Slow loris is a group of several species of a nocturnal animal, which are generally found in North East States, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Philippines. It is on the red list of International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Several traditional medicines are prepared from its organs and other parts.</p>
      <p>Indian star tortoises are found in dry areas and scrub forests in India. Many believe that star tortoise at home brings fortune and the accused were taking advantage of that popular belief, Mr Chakravarthy said. Soft shell turtles, on the other hand, are mostly found in rivers and have the ability to stay underwater for prolonged periods.</p>
