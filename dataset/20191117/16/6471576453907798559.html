      <p>Painted in <i>‚Äúthe highest quality, most vibrant paint Acura offers on a production car,‚Äù</i> the limited-edition model <i>‚Äúcombines the line-topping premium features of the Advance Package with the sporty character of the A-Spec line.‚Äù </i>Because of this exclusiveness, the starting price is expected to be approximately $65,000 for the mid-sized crossover with the 3.5-liter V6.</p>
      <p>Cranking out 290 horsepower and 267 pound-feet of torque, the i-VTEC engine is coupled to a nine-speed automatic transmission and Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive. The SH-<a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/a.html#ge-all-wheel-drive"><u>AWD</u></a> has torque vectoring for greater stability in the corners, and every MDX PMC Edition<i> ‚Äúreceives the same quality control process as the NSX‚Äù </i>according to Honda‚Äôs luxed-up division.</p>
      <p>While that doesn‚Äôt say much, it‚Äôs also worth remembering that the Performance Manufacturing Center assembles the MDX PMC Edition by hand. During shipping, the Valencia Red Pearl paintwork and 20-inch alloy wheels finished in gloss black are protected by a special car cover. Single-vehicle carriers are utilized for freight, which goes to show how much attention to detail goes into every single one of those 330 units. Not bad, <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2020-acura-tlx-pmc-edition-ready-for-new-york-debut-133687.html">Acura</a>!</p>
      <p>Milano leather upholstery, Alcantara trim, black piping, red stitching, a sports steering wheel, metal paddle shifters, and a serialized plaque on the lowermost part of the center console are the interior highlights. As with every other MDX out there, the PMC Edition features a push-button transmission interface as opposed to a good ol‚Äô shifter with the typical P-R-N-D pattern.</p>
      <p>A dyno check, rough-road simulation, and water leak test are performed ahead of shipping, but on the other hand, would you pay $65,000 for an MDX that features the same kind of suck-squeeze-bang-blow as the base trim level at $44,400 excluding destination charge? What‚Äôs worse, the Sport Hybrid SH-AWD drivetrain option boasts 321 ponies as opposed to 290. üèÅ</p>

        <summary>PRESS RELEASE</summary>
        <p>15 NOVEMBER 2019</p>
        <p>Leveraging the advanced technology and human craftsmanship of Acura‚Äôs bespoke supercar factory, the 2020 Acura MDX PMC Edition will make its debut on Nov. 20, at AutoMobility LA. Covered in lustrous, PMC-exclusive Valencia Red Pearl paint, the MDX PMC Edition is the latest limited edition vehicle from Acura‚Äôs prestigious Performance Manufacturing Center (PMC) in Marysville, Ohio. Hand-assembled by the same master technicians who build the NSX supercar1 the 2020 Acura MDX PMC Edition will launch early next year with just 300 vehicles built for the U.S. market and 30 for Canada2. U.S. pricing is expected to be in the mid-$60,000 range.</p>
        <p>The MDX PMC Edition is powered by Acura‚Äôs 3.5-liter direct-injected i-VTEC¬Æ V6 engine with 290 peak horsepower (SAE net) and 267 lb.-ft. peak torque (SAE net), mated to a quick-shifting and highly refined 9-speed automatic transmission and torque-vectoring Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive‚Ñ¢ (SH-AWD¬Æ).</p>
        <p>To create this line-topping PMC edition, Acura combines the premium features of the MDX Advance Package with the sporty character of the MDX A-Spec package ‚Äì a unique and exclusive build in the line-up. PMC Edition-exclusive exterior design elements include: Valencia Red Pearl paint, gloss black 20-inch alloy wheels, a body color grille surround with gloss-black grille mesh, black chrome exhaust finishers; and gloss-black treatment for the roof, roof antenna, exterior mirrors, window molding, rear license plate garnish and door handles.</p>
        <p>Inside, the MDX PMC Edition is further distinguished by black Milano leather seats with Alcantara‚Ñ¢ inserts, black piping and red stitching for the seats, doors linings and center armrest. Its thick A-Spec sport steering wheel is adorned in dimpled black leather with red stitching and metal-finished paddle shifters, complemented by a red illuminated meter and A-Spec floormats. An individually numbered serial plaque on the lower console designates the 2020 MDX PMC Edition as a limited edition vehicle handcrafted at Acura‚Äôs Performance Manufacturing Center.</p>
        <p>Following the hand-assembly process, each MDX PMC Edition receives the same quality control process as NSX, including a dyno check, paint inspection, rough-road simulation and water leak test. To protect the paint during shipping, the PMC Edition is wrapped in a specially designed car cover and transported to Acura dealers via enclosed, single-car carriers.</p>
