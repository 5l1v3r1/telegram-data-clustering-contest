      <p>The Flagler County Sheriff's Office received an anonymous call Friday at 7 p.m. about a duffel bag that washed up on the beach in Palm Coast, <a href="https://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/local/flagler-county-sheriffs-office-recovers-15-kilos-of-cocaine-that-washed-up-on-beach-police-say_/1009514422">Action News Jax</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The duffel bag was covered in barnacles and seaweed and contained 15 individually wrapped packages, the Sheriff's Office said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/flagler-county-sheriffs-office/fcso-recovers-15-kilos-of-cocaine-that-washed-up-on-the-beach/1406315149543346/">Facebook post</a>.

      <p>One of the kilo-sized bricks was opened and a block of white substance was exposed, according to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/flagler-county-sheriffs-office/fcso-recovers-15-kilos-of-cocaine-that-washed-up-on-the-beach/1406315149543346/">report</a>. The substance field-tested positive for cocaine, deputies said.</p>
      <p>"It is likely that these drugs have been in the ocean for a long time, and they just happened to wash up on our beach from the rough surf and wind we have had the last few days," Flagler County Sheriff Rick Staly said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/flagler-county-sheriffs-office/fcso-recovers-15-kilos-of-cocaine-that-washed-up-on-the-beach/1406315149543346/">statement</a>.  "I'm thankful that the person who located the bag did the right thing and called us. These are dangerous narcotics and could be deadly in the wrong hands."</p>
      <p>A search of the beach was conducted, and no additional bags were located, according to the Sheriff's Office. Surrounding law enforcement agencies were notified of the narcotics so that they could also check their beaches, the Sheriff's Office said on its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/flagler-county-sheriffs-office/fcso-recovers-15-kilos-of-cocaine-that-washed-up-on-the-beach/1406315149543346/">Facebook page</a>.</p>
