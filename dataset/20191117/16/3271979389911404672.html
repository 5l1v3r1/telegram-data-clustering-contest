      <p>Is <b>Sandra Bullock</b> really planning <b>Keanu Reeves</b>’ engagement party to <b>Alexandra Grant</b>? That’s what a tabloid is claiming, but considering the actor hasn’t gotten engaged, the simple answer is no. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can set the record straight.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted <b><i>OK!</i></b> for making up a story about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/keanu-reeves-alexandra-grant-wedding-malibu/">Reeves and Grant planning a secret wedding in Malibu</a> for next spring. As we noted, it’s unclear if the actor and his longtime friend/business partner are even a couple, but although they might be dating, they’re certainly not engaged to be married. We’ve reached out to Reeves’ rep for clarification about his relationship with Grant, but trusted sources assure us they’re not headed down the aisle, regardless of whether the romance rumors are true.</p>
      <p>The magazine, however, couldn’t help but publish a follow-up story dragging Reeves’ longtime pal and <i>Speed</i> co-star into the equation. “[Bullock’s] decided to throw them an engagement party!” a supposed insider tells the outlet, adding that the actress will hold the celebration at her home in Los Angeles. “Sandra is going to handle it all – the invites, the catering the music. She promised it’s going to be the perfect evening, and not too over the top.”</p>
      <p>The outlet goes on to say that Reeves initially told Bullock it wasn’t necessary, but she insisted as he’s “been Sandra’s rock over the years, through good times and bad, and now she wants to return the favor.” The alleged source concludes, “This party is the least she can do for a friend as sweet has he is.”</p>
      <p>Reeves might very well be a sweet friend, but nothing else about the tabloid’s article is accurate. Bullock isn’t throwing a party to celebrate and imaginary engagement. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can’t say for sure whether or not the actor is in a romance with Grant, but we have learned he didn’t propose to her and they’re not getting married in Malibu next spring.</p>
      <p>It should be noted, this isn’t the first time <i>OK!</i> has invented a bogus premise involving the <i>Speed</i> co-stars. This past January, <b>Gossip Cop</b> called out the magazine for falsely claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/sandra-bullock-keanu-reeves-boyfriend-bryan-randall/">Bullock was “torn between” Reeves and her boyfriend Bryan Randall</a>. This latest piece makes no mention of any sort of dramatic love triangle going down earlier this year.</p>
      <p>This is also the same tabloid that insisted two months ago <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/keanu-reeves-child-adopt/">Reeves was single and adopting a baby by himself. </a>Naturally, that fake storyline makes no appearance in this latest article either. The publication is simply coming up with its reports as it goes along.</p>
