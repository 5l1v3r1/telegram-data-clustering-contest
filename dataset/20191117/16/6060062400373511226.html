      <h1>More married baby boomers combine finances than any generation after them, and it speaks to one of the ways money and marriage are changing</h1>

        <li>Married millennials and Gen Xers are keeping their finances separate from their partner much more often than married baby boomers, and it shows that younger generations are thinking about <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/money-reasons-to-get-married-2019-7">marriage and finances</a> differently.</li>
        <li>About 37% of millennials and 36% of Gen Xers are keeping their finances separate, while just 27% of baby boomers say the same. </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-combine-finances-with-a-partner">Combining finances</a> is a choice that's different for every couple. Experts say <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/signs-youre-on-the-same-page-as-partner-about-money-2019-8">staying on the same page</a> as your partner about money is essential, no matter whether you share accounts.</li>

      <p>Marriage doesn't always mean a joint checking account these days. In fact, many Americans are choosing to keep finances separate after tying the knot. </p>
      <p>In an Insider and Morning Consult survey of about 2,000 Americans on their financial habits for the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/the-state-of-our-money">State of Our Money</a> series, one question asked married people whether they kept separate or combined accounts. It was not specified whether respondents were in same or different-sex marriages.</p>
      <p>The data found that money in marriage might be changing when when compared to older generations. Overall, 64% of all married people had combined their finances. About 37% of married millennials kept their finances separate from their partner's, as did about 36% of Gen Xers.</p>
      <p>However, only 27% of baby boomers did the same.</p>
      <p>The increase in the number of younger Americans who are keeping finances separate hints at just one of the ways marriage and money have changed since the boomers' generation.</p>
      <h3>Deciding whether to combine finances is a personal choice</h3>
      <p>For some couples, keeping finances separate just means that there's one less source of stress in the relationship. Brandon of the Mad Fientist, 37, and his wife Jill told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-keeping-finances-separate-crucial-happy-marriage-2017-1">Business Insider's Tanza Loudenback</a> that they kept their finances separate for exactly this reason. Jill said, "I think our marriage would've been doomed if we had everything in a joint account. I think that would've caused a lot of arguments."</p>
      <p>Millennials and Gen Xers are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/money-stress-millennial-gen-x-relationships-2019-10">already stressed about money</a> within their relationships — about 62% of millennials and 56% of Gen Xers report that money adds stress to their relationship. Sixty-four percent of boomers say that money isn't a source of stress in their marriage or relationship.</p>
      <p>However, joint accounts make it easy to keep on top of shared financial goals, share in responsibility, and maintain transparency.  </p>
      <p>Financial therapist Amanda Clayman told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reasons-couples-should-combine-finances-according-to-experts">Business Insider contributor Caroline Lupini </a>that while separate accounts limit vulnerability, it requires extra work. "With everything separate, there is no structural requirement that you communicate and coordinate," she said. "You're less flexible as a team to deal with changes."</p>
      <p>No matter which setup works for your household, you'll want to be on the same page about money. Financial planner Christine Centeno <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/make-a-spreadsheet-to-get-on-the-same-page-money-2019-8">previously told Business Insider</a> that her favorite sign of couples who are financially in sync is a simple spreadsheet. </p>
      <p>"They've both gone through this spreadsheet," she said. "They have all the numbers and they're like, 'here's what we want to do.'"</p>
