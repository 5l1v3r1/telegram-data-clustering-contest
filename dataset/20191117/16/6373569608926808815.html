      <h1>The date when you should put your Christmas tree up according to tradition</h1>
      <h2>Have you put yours up already?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:32:09+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:32</time> by <a rel="author">Nisha Mal, Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>With just over five weeks to go until <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a>, many have started getting into the festive spirit.</p>
      <p>It's almost impossible to avoid Christmas adverts and songs at the moment, with festive markets opening up across the country.</p>
      <p>Some have wasted little time in putting their decorations up already, whilst others leave it later.</p>
      <p>But when is the right time to get the tree out from the attic?</p>
      <p>Most people tend to pick December 1 as the date to get put it up, but this isn't the 'correct' date, according to tradition.</p>
      <p>Traditionally a tree would have been bought and decorated on the afternoon of Christmas Eve, <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/should-put-up-christmas-tree-3543294">StokeonTrent Live</a> reports.</p>

      <p>But in modern times most people like to make the most of their snazzy decorations and put them up much earlier than this.</p>
      <p>It is generally thought you should put the tree up 12 days before Christmas - although it is unclear where this stems from. One theory is it could be because of the festive song Twelve Days of Christmas by the English baritone singer Frederic Austin.</p>
      <p>It is considered bad luck to keep your tree and decorations up twelve days after Christmas.</p>
      <p>This is understood to be the last day of the Christmas festivities and in the past it was believed that spirits lived in the holly and ivy people used to decorate their homes with. And so once the celebrations were over these spirits needed to be released.</p>
      <h3>What type of real tree can I buy?</h3>
      <p>According to the British Christmas Tree Growers Association these are some of the best species to buy for your home:</p>

      <p>The Norway Spruce tree is the traditional tree found in our homes during the month of December. It has long brown cones attached to its branches and its needles stand on tiny pegs.</p>
      <p>A Nobel Fur tree is another popular choice and it was originally introduced to Britain in 1830. It comes from the forests of Washington and Oregon in America.</p>
      <p>Arguably the most popular tree bought at Christmas is the Nordman Fir. As well as being very popular in the UK it is also a firm favourite amongst people in Denmark too. It is originally from south Russia.</p>
      <p>The Scots Pine tree comes from the Caledonian Pine forests and is much shorter and stumpier than the other trees. It has pointed shaped cones and its needles are 4cm to 7cm long.</p>
