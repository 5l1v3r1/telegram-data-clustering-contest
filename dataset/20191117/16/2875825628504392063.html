      <p>Roman Kemp's girlfriend has shared the very romantic gift he left behind for her while he's thousands of miles away in the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> jungle.</p>
      <p>26-year-old Roman is one of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/breaking-im-celebrity-2019-line-20835125">12 stars</a> competing in the ITV entertainment show this year.</p>
      <p>Revealing a different side to the Capital presenter, his partner Anne-Sophie Flury explained how romantic Roman went to great lengths to ensure she won't be forgotten about while he's in Australia.</p>
      <p>"He's left me a two minute video for every day that he can't speak to me," Anne-Sophie revealed. "I'll get to watch one of them every morning.</p>

      <p>"He filmed them before he left and put them on a USB stick so I'll have to try and keep it to just one a day," she added.</p>
      <p>Anne-Sophie, who is from Switzerland, lived in Hong Kong for eight months of her two year relationship with Roman and joked it was 'only fair' that Roman has his time away too.</p>
      <p>But she admits this is the longest they've ever not been in contact for.</p>
      <p>"I'm so excited but I miss him so much! It's really difficult not being able to speak to him.</p>
      <p>"It'll be easier when the show starts so I can watch what he's up to."</p>

      <p>Anne-Sophie, of company Shu Gum, says she has watched the show in the past and has been 'training' Roman to help him with some of the BushTucker Trials.</p>
      <p>"We haven't actually eaten meat for two years but I've been introducing him to it again. Every time we've been out recently I've tried to get him trying something different. I think he'll be alright with it," predicts Anne-Sophie.</p>
      <p>But Roman, who is the son of Martin Kemp and Shirlie Holliman, does have an usual phobia in the form of frogs.</p>
      <p>"Frogs he hates. But spiders and creepy crawlies he'll be great with," said Anne-Sophie.</p>
      <p>Critters asides, how will Roman cope with his celebrity campmates?</p>

      <p>"I love that they've put in a mix of people," said Anne Sophie. "I know that Roman gets on really well with Kate Garraway so he'll gravitate towards her. They've both been excited to be in there and to know someone.</p>
      <p>"But I think Roman get on well with everyone. He's so charming and he knows how to speak people. I think he'll be the mediator if anything. He won't have any arguments."</p>
      <p>Anne-Sophie also predicts a friendship between Roman and Caitlyn Jenner, who is the highest paid star of the series this year.</p>
      <p>"I'm a huge fan of the Kardshians so it's nice to have a different version of the show featuring my boyfriend!"</p>
