      <p>Netherlands captain Virgil van Dijk will miss Tuesday’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Estonia for personal reasons, the Dutch federation announced on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“The manager Ronald Koeman will not be able to call up Virgil van Dijk on Tuesday against Estonia”, the federation said on its website.</p>
      <p>“The Dutch captain has had to withdraw from the match for personal reasons and left the training camp immediately.”</p>
      <p>The Dutch booked their passage to next year’s finals, their first major competition since the 2014 World Cup, with a goalless draw against Northern Ireland in Belfast on Saturday.</p>
      <p>At stake in Tuesday’s game will be the top spot in Group C which is currently held by Germany who is two points ahead of the Dutch.</p>
      <p>The defender is clear to play for Liverpool against Crystal Palace in the English Premier League at the weekend.</p>
