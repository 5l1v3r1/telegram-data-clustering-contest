        <b>British photographer Terry O'Neill, whose work captured iconic images of London's Swinging Sixties, has died.</b>
      </p>
      <p>O'Neill, 81, had prostate cancer and died at home on Saturday night after a long illness, his agency said.</p>
      <p>He photographed celebrities - including The Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Elton John and the Queen - and received a CBE last month for services to photography.</p>
      <p>BBC Arts Correspondent David Sillito said O'Neil's work helped to define the Swinging Sixties.</p>
      <p>Born in London, O'Neill left school with hopes of becoming a jazz drummer, but ended up working in a photographic unit at London's Heathrow Airport.</p>
      <p>It was there that he captured then Home Secretary Rab Butler, immaculately dressed and asleep on a bench.</p>
      <p>The image helped O'Neill land a job as a newspaper photographer on Fleet Street, where he was assigned to capture the portrait of a new band - The Beatles.</p>

      <p>After receiving his CBE at Buckingham Palace, Mr O'Neill said the award "surpasses anything I've had happen to me in my life".</p>
      <p>He photographed the Queen twice. In 2001 he <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0094978">revealed on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs</a> how he had got her to smile during the second photo shoot in 1992 - a year described by the Queen as an "annus horribilis" - by telling a horse-racing joke.</p>
      <p>"The second time was great," he said. "It was in a bad year, as she put it. And I just got her to laugh because I noticed the first time when she laughed, she made a great picture."</p>
      <p>Sir Elton John, whom O'Neill photographed on numerous occasions, was among those to pay tribute to the photographer <a href="https://twitter.com/eltonofficial/status/1196049487996891136">on Twitter</a>, saying: "He was brilliant, funny and I absolutely loved his company".</p>
      <p>Comedian and children's author David Walliams called O'Neill "a huge talent and an absolute gentleman" and said his death was the "end of an era".</p>

      <p>Iconic Images, the agency which represents O'Neill's work, said he was "a class act, quick-witted and filled with charm".</p>
      <p>A spokesman added: "Anyone who was lucky enough to know or work with him can attest to his generosity and modesty.</p>
      <p>"As one of the most iconic photographers of the last 60 years, his legendary pictures will forever remain imprinted in our memories as well as in our hearts."</p>
