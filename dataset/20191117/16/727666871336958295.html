      <p>The rapper is accused of a second murder, after a man was robbed and killed during a confrontation in San Antonio.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Things aren’t looking good for Tay-K 47.</p>
      <p>The Texas rapper was already sentenced to 55 years in prison for murdering 23-year-old Mark Saldivar.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/tay-k-47-named-a-suspect-in-second-murder-case-involving-san-antonio-shooting-WT_VhEQ8KUuIdvdTqX-TKA/">Now, he has officially been indicted on a capital murder charge which took place at a Chic-fil-A in San Antonio.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Tay-K 47 was charged with shooting and killing Mark Anthony Saldivar during the robbery, which took place in April 2017.</p>
      <p>Tay-K 47, real name Taymor McIntyre, was just 16-years-old during the time of that shooting.</p>
      <p>The incident happened when he was on house arrest in Tarrant County for his role in another murder, which took place during a home invasion.</p>
      <p>The rapper eventually cut off his ankle monitor and fled to San Antonio. While he was on the run, Tay-K allegedly murdered Saldivar and became the target of a national manhunt.</p>
      <p>During his escape, Tay-K unleashed a song titled “The Race” and posed in front of his Wanted poster.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Tay-K 47, the indictment means prosecutors can seek the death penalty against the rapper. </p>
