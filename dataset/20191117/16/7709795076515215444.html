      <h3>If at first you don't succeed, try another 19 times</h3>
      <p>Gerwyn Price finally ended his 19-game winless run against Michael van Gerwen with a thrilling 16-12 victory as he set up a Grand Slam of Darts final with Peter Wright in Wolverhampton on Sunday night.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/boos-ring-out-as-price-triumphs/155062">defending champion</a> produced a fantastic performance to end the world number one's hopes of reclaiming the title for the fourth time and he'll now be marginal favourite to lift the Eric Bristow Trophy for the second year in succession.</p>
      <p>Afterwards the Welshman said: "Michael is one of the best professionals in the world. I was nervous towards the end, the 130 was crucial. He's been lucky the last three times and I thought he was going to get lucky again but thankfully I got over the line and got the demon off my back."</p>

      <h3>Final destination for Snakebite</h3>
      <p>Peter Wright reached his 13th major final after a 16-11 victory over Glen Durrant at the Boylesports Grand Slam of Darts on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>In their first TV meeting since the <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/wright-to-face-anderson/125217">2017 quarter-finals</a>, when Snakebite went on to finish <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/van-gerwen-wins-grand-slam-title/125784">runner-up</a> to Michael van Gerwen, the Scotsman found an extra gear at 9-8 ahead to win seven of the next 10 legs as he moved one win away from his second major title of his career and certainly his biggest.</p>

      <p>Wright, <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/grand-slam-of-darts-betting-tips/173801">who was tipped up at 12/1 in our pre-tournament preview</a>, has lost 11 of his previous 12 major finals, with eight of those coming against MVG, while his only success came in the <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/peter-wright-wins-uk-open/41275">2017 UK Open</a> when he defeated Gerwyn Price.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old was van Gerwen's victim again as recently as October's <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/mvg-stuns-wright-in-final/172996">Champions League of Darts</a> final and he'll probably be a little relieved Price has done him a favour.</p>
      <p>Wright could also be feeling comparatively fresher than his opponent thanks to getting his job done earlier in the afternoon and he'll be grateful it wasn't as mentally draining as it could have.</p>
      <p>It wasn't his best performance of the tournament so far with an average of 97.34 and four 180s while he also missed 25 darts at a double, including five in the 17th leg that allowed Durrant to reduce his lead to 9-8.</p>
      <p>That said his burst to the finish line including two ton plus checkouts - a 101 to complete a fine 12-darter for a 13-8 advantage before a stunning 155 finish made it 14-9.</p>

      <p>Durrant averaged 94.28, hit eight 180s and two 100+ checkouts including a brilliant 143, was left to rue missing 30 attempts at doubles but he'll still head home proud of his efforts this week following a third televised PDC semi-final of <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/pdc-darts-2019-season/156982">2019</a> from five events.</p>
      <p>Since switching from the BDO at the start of the year, the <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/bdo-world-darts-draw-and-schedule/156855">three-time Lakeside champion</a>'s dream debut season on the circuit has also seen him reach the last four of the <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/duzza-defeats-mvg-anderson-out/169328">World Matchplay</a> and the <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/darts/news/chizzy-to-face-mvg-in-dublin-final/172670">World Grand Prix</a> while he's also won two floor titles. The wait for a maiden TV final - and trophy - might not be too much longer.</p>
