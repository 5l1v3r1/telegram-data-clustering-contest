      <p><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/a28233543/kate-middleton-and-other-stories-dress-shop/">Kate Middleton</a> and <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g15835059/meghan-markle-style-shopping-guide/">Meghan Markle</a> are both fashion icons, but each of the duchesses have their own unique sense of style. There is some overlap in their wardrobes, however—like their love of wearing espadrilles while traveling.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/news/g3203/kate-middleton-best-fashion-moments/">Duchess of Cambridge</a> wore the shoe style during her royal tour of India in 2016 and the <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g28541046/meghan-markle-favorite-brands/">Duchess of Sussex</a> wore them during both of her official royal tours—to Australia and New Zealand in 2018 and, even more recently, to South Africa over the summer.</p>
      <p>Kate and Meghan aren't the only royals who pack espadrilles in their travel wardrobes. <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g22560422/queen-letizia-of-spain-style-outfits/">Queen Letizia of Spain</a> was photographed in a pair of espadrille wedges this week during her royal tour of Cuba with her husband, King Felipe.</p>
