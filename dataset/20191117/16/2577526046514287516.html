      <h1>Jedi Fallen Order's Opening Is The Uncharted Star Wars Game We Never Got</h1>

      <p>One of the saddest bits of news this year was the cancellation of Visceral's <i>Star Wars</i> game, an adventure billed as an open-world <i>Uncharted</i> in the classic LucasArts universe. We'll never see what that could of been, but at least in the opening, <i>Jedi Fallen Order</i> does its best to bring those <i>Uncharted</i> vibes back.</p>
      <p>The game launched on PC, PS4 and Xbox One recently. I purchased a copy through Origin, having not received a code or signed any NDAs, and went through the initial level where Cal's asked to take on a slightly dangerous scrap mission.</p>
      <p>It's super reminiscent of <i>Uncharted 2</i>, although the main danger element comes about ten minutes in and not from the opening scene. You're not dealing with any Force powers at this stage, simply getting a hang of traversing the environment and enjoying the basic textures and world Respawn has created. There's a lot of Naughty Dog-esque moments: hanging by a hand, climbing, jumping, sliding, and beautiful, giant backdrops.</p>
      <p>Put simply: it's stunning. You can see the first chunk of gameplay for yourself below.</p>
