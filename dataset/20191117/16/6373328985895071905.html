      <p>After <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> and<i> Spider-Man: Far From Home</i> closed more than 10 years of big-scale storytelling, for the first time in a decade, we don’t know where the MCU is leading.</p>
      <p>However, with the launch of new streaming platform Disney+, the world belongs to the House of Mouse more than ever.</p>

      <p>Adding to the list of upcoming superhero releases, Disney has set dates for five untitled Marvel movies, as per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disney-sets-2021-release-ridley-scotts-last-duel-pushes-back-kings-man-7-months-1255349"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The unknown films are set for: October 7, 2022; February 17, 2023; May 5, 2023; July 28, 2023; and November 3, 2023. All things going to plan, that means we can expect four Marvel Studio films in 2022 and 2023.</p>
      <p>The studio previously set May 6, 2022, for <i>Black Panther 2</i>, along with reserving February 18, 2022, and July 29, 2022, for other untitled Marvel projects.</p>

      <p>What could these untitled films be? Well, James Gunn’s <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</i> and Peyton Reed’s <i>Ant-Man 3</i> are in the works currently. It’s also a relatively safe bet one of those dates is reserved for <i>Captain Marvel 2</i>, following the success of the first film.</p>

      <p>There’s also Blade, the cult-classic vampire killer, who was announced to be returning to the big screen earlier this year. Mahershala Ali will play the hero, but there’s been no confirmation of when.</p>

      <p>Not to mention the small matter of the Fantastic Four and X-Men – following Disney’s purchase of Fox, they’re currently in development in some capacity to join the MCU, along with <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/film-and-tv/writers-confirm-deadpool-3-will-be-r-rated/">Ryan Reynolds’ Deadpool</a>.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Marvel Entertainment Chief Creative Officer Kevin Feige unveiled Phase Four of the MCU. The upcoming films are: <i>Black Widow</i> (May 1, 2020); <i>The Eternals</i> (November 6, 2020); <i>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</i> (February 12, 2021); <i>Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness</i> (May 7, 2021); and <i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i> (November 5, 2021).</p>
