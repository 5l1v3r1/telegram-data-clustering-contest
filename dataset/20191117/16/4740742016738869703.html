      <p>With a city steeped in history it is perhaps not surprising that Bristol has a lot of historic pubs.</p>
      <p>Many which were serving drinks to punters hundreds of years ago still stand today - albeit with slightly different range of drinks than in the 13th century.</p>
      <p>But which pub is the oldest? And are there any close contenders? And what are the stories behind these magnificent buildings?</p>
      <h3>The Hatchet Inn</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>There's a layer of human skin on the Hatchet's front door - apparently</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Everyone who knows anything about Bristol knows the eerie story of this public house in Frogmore Street.</p>
      <p>Local legend has it it's haunted, and beneath the paint and tar of the front door there, apparently, a layer of human skin. Spooky.</p>
      <p>The Hatchet in its original form dates some 410 years, to 1606, when Bristol was a key player in the UK's seafaring trade.</p>
      <p>Its name reportedly originates from the axes used by woodsmen in Clifton Wood.</p>
      <p>During the 18th Century, the pub was known for its cock-fighting ring which later became a bare-knuckle boxing venue, producing local champions Benjamin Brain, Jem Belcher and Henry Pearce.</p>
      <p>Now Grade II listed and owned by Butcombe Brewery it has stayed true to tradition with its focus on real ales and draws in tourists intrigued by its dark history - and, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/bristols-oldest-pub-hatchet-gone-3390877">it's even gone vegan this year</a>.</p>
      <p>According to one TripAdvisor reviewer, "it is a reflection of what is expected of an English pub" and "reflects its historical presence in Bristol".</p>
      <h3>The Rummer Hotel</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/article789180.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/The-Rummer-Hotel.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>The Rummer Hotel's 800-year-old site makes it a contender for oldest pub</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A contentious addition as the inn has stood and worked as a public house, probably continuously, on The Rummer's site since the 1200s â€“ which makes it a clear favourite for the title. But history tells us it was rebuilt in 1742.</p>
      <p>Cuts from the Bristol Post tell us it's the oldest licenced premises, dating back to 1241, when it was known as the Green Lattis, but its rebuild leaves the matter to debate.</p>
      <p>The Rummer in All Saints Lane has hosted some important moments in Bristol's history; it was the destination of the first stagecoach from London in 1742, around the time of the rebuild.</p>
      <p>It now runs as a cocktail bar and micro-distillery.</p>
      <h3>The Llandoger Trow</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/it-sad-day-last-orders-2781128">Now sadly closed</a>, this pub was popular for revellers on King Street right back to 1664 the Trow is steeped in history.</p>
      <p>The pub is said to have inspired the description of the Admiral Benbow Inn in Treasure Island, written by Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>
      <p>Another author, Daniel Defore, supposedly met Alexander Selkirk there which became his inspiration for Robinson Crusoe.</p>
      <p>Like most old pubs, it is believed to be haunted with as many as 15 ghosts.</p>
      <p>The pub <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/it-sad-day-last-orders-2781128">closed in April this year and the pub remains up for sale</a>.</p>
      <h3>The Ostrich Inn</h3>

      <p>The Ostrich was supposedly built in 1745 and, being by the harbourside, was a favourite for merchants, dockside workers and sailors.</p>
      <h3>Any others to check out?</h3>
      <p>The Full Moon in Stokes Croft isn't itself as old as either of those, by a long shot, but is apparently the latest in a series of pubs on the site dating back to the 1200s.</p>
      <p>An old cutting from the Bristol Post also tells us The Shakespeare, in Victoria Street, is 'also ancient', but doesn't give an exact date to the building. The pub's website tell us it's set in a timber framed house which was built in 1636.</p>
