      <p>A thief who stole £13,600 from a pensioner and threatened to show a ‘video of her naked’ has been jailed.</p>
      <p>Benjamin Watts, 41, was jailed for preying on the widowed pensioner, after the kind-hearted 76-year-old took pity on him and lent him some money.</p>
      <p>Watts pleaded guilty to the theft at Warwick Crown Court on the basis that he had permission to use her card, and had repaid £4,400 of the money.</p>
      <p>But following a ‘trial of issue’, his account was rejected by Judge Andrew Lockhart QC who sentenced Watts, of Kettering, Northamptonshire, for two-and-a-half years.</p>
      <p>The unnamed victim told the court she had met Watts in around October 2015, when he had done some work for her at her home in Kettering and they had become ‘very close’.</p>
      <p>But after challenging him about more missing money, she says Watts claimed to have videos of her.</p>

      <p>Judge Lockhart explained: ‘The victim had lent £7,800 to him in order that he might buy a van.</p>
      <p>‘She then discovered several transactions without her knowledge. She says “he never gave me £4,400 back.”</p>
      <p>‘I can only make a finding against Mr Watts if I am sure she is right.</p>
      <p>‘There is no doubt he took (some) of the funds, the issue is whether it is as much as the Crown allege.</p>

      <p>‘I find I am absolutely sure the Crown are right, that her evidence is truthful and reliable, and that he never had her permission to use this card.</p>
      <p>‘I reject the basis of plea. I am sure that the amount he stole was £13,600, and that there were veiled threats.’</p>
      <p>The victim claimed that after lending Watts money to buy a new van, her bank told her she had exceeded her approved overdraft – which she could not understand.</p>
      <p>Her bank statements revealed 28 cash withdrawals – which she said had been made without her knowledge and mostly late at night or in the early hours of the morning – totalling £13,600.</p>
      <p>She said she had not given anyone permission to make those withdrawals and that he had only repaid £150, as far as she could remember.</p>
      <p>It was then that he made the threats about videos, she added.</p>

      <p>‘I took that to be some form of blackmail. He said that he would show the court a video of me naked.’</p>
      <p>Asked if she was aware of any such video being made, the pensioner replied firmly: ‘Absolutely not.’</p>
      <p>During evidence, Watts had claimed: ‘She told me to use that money whenever I wanted for equipment and so-on.</p>
      <p>‘She let me use her card. Every time I used the bank card I told her about it.’</p>
      <p>He said the jobs he was doing would be paid for in cash, and that he would then pay back the pensioner in cash.</p>
      <p>But the victim disputed that he ever had permission to withdraw money from her account when he wanted and that he had repaid £4,400.</p>
