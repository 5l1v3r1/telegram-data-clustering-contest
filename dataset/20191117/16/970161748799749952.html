      <p>Radio One’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> Roberts is heading into the I’m a Celebrity jungle tonight but this is far from her first rodeo in reality TV.</p>
      <p>The star actually got her breakthrough thanks to her appearance in the third season of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/big-brother/">Big Brother</a>, which by all accounts might be the most legendary season the show ever created, back in 2002.</p>
      <p>And she actually proved to be behind some of the most notable moments of the series history.</p>
      <p>Moving into the Elstree compound with a bunch of unknown names at the time, Adele and a whole heap of her castmates are now TV royalty.</p>
      <p>Among the bunch? Jade Goody, Alison Hammond and Kate Lawler.</p>
      <p>The Southport native proved to be a winner within the house to begin with, as one of the OG castmates that were fighting for the prize money.</p>

      <p>In particular, the boys of the house found her attractive, and she even engaged in a flirtation with Lee Davey for a while.</p>

      <p>However, that came to an abrupt end with major moment number one – coming out as bisexual on national telly.</p>
      <p>While that might not be a big deal now, it definitely was 16 years ago, as Adele had to let Lee down gently, revealing that she was bi and had a girlfriend on the outside of the house.</p>
      <p>Lee took the rejection on the chin, and the pair became tight friends regardless once she’d come out to him, remaining close throughout their time on the show.</p>
      <p>However her relationships weren’t always smooth sailing, which comes to major moment number two: her massive fallout with Jade.</p>

      <p>It’s something that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebritys-adele-roberts-feels-guilty-about-explosive-big-brother-row-with-jade-goody-11166450/">she has since admitted regret about</a>, considering Jade ended up in tears as Adele mocked her for not knowing what a verucca was causing Jade to utter the ‘Am I minging?!’ catchphrase for the first time.</p>
      <p>Adele admitted that she judged too quickly with some of her housemates, and hopes to be nicer this time round.</p>
      <p>During her time on the show, Adele managed to last three rounds of nominations without a single vote to get her out, but her luck ran out on Day 43, when she was booted from the show in seventh place.</p>

      <p>Her exit was one of the first notable ‘boo’ moments the show had seen, as her popularity dwindled on the outside and 64% of voters wanted her out.</p>
      <p>At least in the jungle there’s no live audience waiting for you…</p>
