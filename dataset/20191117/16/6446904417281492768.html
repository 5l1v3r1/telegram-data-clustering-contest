      <p>MEATH GAA STAR Graham Geraghty is appealing for the return of a “lifetime of memories” after six Leinster championship medals were stolen from his home on Friday night. </p>
      <p>Geraghty, who dominated Meath football throughout the 1990s and the 2000s and captained his county to All-Ireland success, is offering a reward for the return of the medals. </p>
      <p>It’s understood that the burglary occurred between 9.30pm and 12.30am on Friday evening at his home in Higginstown, Athboy. </p>
      <p>Gardaí confirmed that a burglary in the Higginstown area and that they are investigating. </p>
      <p>In a Facebook post, his wife Amanda said that it took “blood, sweat and tears” to win the medals. </p>
      <p>Calling them a “lifetime of memories”, she asked for the medals to be returned. </p>
      <p>“We will gladly give you what the cash for gold shops will give you for them and more,” she said. </p>
      <p>Geraghty was the captain when Meath won the All-Ireland in 1999 against Cork, while he also enjoyed All-Ireland championship success with his county at under-21 and minor level. </p>
      <p>The former player, who represented Ireland in the International Rules series, also unsuccessfully contested the <a href="https://www.rte.ie/sport/football/2006/1212/212285-geraghtyg/">2007 general election</a> for Fine Gael. </p>
      <p>Geraghty retired from <a href="https://archive.is/20130904084427/http://www.thescore.ie/end-of-the-road-admits-geraghty-as-meath-plan-without-former-talisman-524070-Jul2012/">inter-county football</a> in 2012. </p>
