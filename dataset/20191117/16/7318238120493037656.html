      <p>There were no red carpets, no tickets, nor a fancy jury at the Russian outdoor film festival — just an audience happy to choose a winner for a competition that started back in June.</p>
      <p>The competing short films were shown for free across the whole country in cities, towns and small remote villages. Millions watched and voted with the lights on their smartphones.</p>
      <p>The festival is non-profit and only exists thanks to donations and volunteers.</p>
      <p>There were 85 films on the main programme this year and 10 were shortlisted. It was clear that the audience preferred humour and a happy ending. One of the funnier films previewed at the festival was ‘Harmony’.</p>

      <p>It depicts one mother’s battle to learn to respect her son’s passion for air guitar. Another favourite was ‘Set-up’ which tells the story of a corrupt governor who traps the devil.</p>
      <p>The winning director of this year's edition is 28-year-old Nikita Vlasov. He started making films two years ago.</p>
      <p>His film, ‘Pod’, is about a standard Russian family situation with a bride, a groom and a mother in law, who incidentally works as a military engineer. She gives her son a mine as a present, but his bride accidentally sits on it and that's how the two women meet.</p>

      <p>Vlasov was awarded €21,000 and said he will use it to produce his next film.</p>
      <p>The festival is being hailed as a way for young Russian directors to showcase their talent and to conquer the hearts of millions across the country.</p>
