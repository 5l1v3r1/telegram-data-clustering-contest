      <h1>Wikipedia Co-Founder Launches WT:Social, A New Social Network</h1>

        <b>The co-founder of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, has launched WT:Social – a new social platform focused on changing the social media landscape.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Social media is in crisis. Over time, platforms have amplified the voices of bad actors and <a href="https://wersm.com/whatsapp-will-pay-researchers-to-study-its-fake-news-problem/">spread fake news</a> across the globe, affecting societies, the people within them, democratic processes, and a lot more. The algorithms behind them just seem to “care only about engagement’, and keeping people addicted to platforms without substance.”</p>
      <p>In a bid to make a change, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has <a href="https://wt.social/">launched a new social media network</a> called WT:Social last month, focusing on news and promising to ensure that user privacy is protected. More importantly, it promises a social media space that is “ad-free.”</p>
      <p>WT also promises to “never sell your data,” but ad-free comes at a price – at least for some users. WT aims to survive on the generosity of donors who will pay  €12 per month, or €90 per year to fund it.</p>
      <p>While there are over <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmy_wales/status/1195447430273212418">100k users already on the platform</a>, there are 100k others in a waiting list to join.</p>

      <p>If you would like to skip the queue, you can become a subscribing member. “The business model of social-media companies, of pure advertising, is problematic,” Wales explains in a recent Financial Times article. “It turns out the huge winner is low-quality content.”</p>
      <p>On WT, users will be able to make their own choices as to what content they are served. They can also directly edit misleading headlines and flag posts that are problematic.</p>
      <p>WT is structured about interest-based discussion groups – or SubWikis – which users can either join or create.</p>
