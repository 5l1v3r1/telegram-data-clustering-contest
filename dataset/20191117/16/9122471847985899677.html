      <h1>ESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit Releases His New Top 6 Poll</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:45:13+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>ESPN college football analyst Kirk Herbstreit has updated his personal rankings following Week 12 of the 2019 regular season.</p>
      <p>There hasn’t been too much of a shuffling in Herbstreit’s rankings, as most of the country’s top teams won on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Two undefeated teams – Baylor and Minnesota – both lost in Week 12, though, and the Golden Gophers have since fallen out of Herbstreit’s top six.</p>
      <p>Here’s his latest poll:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>LSU</li>
        <li>Ohio State</li>
        <li>Clemson</li>
        <li>Georgia</li>
        <li>Alabama</li>
        <li>Oregon</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Alabama is perhaps the most-intriguing team right now. The Crimson Tide <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/molly-mcgrath-message-for-qb-tua-tagovailoa">have lost quarterback Tua Tagovailoa for the season</a>. Will the College Football Playoff selection committee consider the Crimson Tide a contender without him?</p>
      <p>We’ll find out in the weeks to come.</p>
      <p>The new College Football Playoff rankings will be out on Tuesday night.</p>
