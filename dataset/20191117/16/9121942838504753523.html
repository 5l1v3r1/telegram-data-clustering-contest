      <p>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Mike Evans was held in check by New Orleans, again.</p>
      <p>The Tampa Bay receiver had just one catch for 6 yards in the first half and finished with four overall in the Buccaneers’ 34-17 loss to the Saints on Sunday.</p>
      <p>New Orleans beat Tampa Bay 31-24 at home on Oct. 6., holding Evans without a catch. The defender who primarily covered Evans, cornerback Marshon Lattimore, didn’t play Sunday due to a hamstring injury.</p>
      <p>“It’s the exact same coverages as the last time they played us” Evans said. “A lot of two-man and cover-2 almost every single snap. If I’m outside, it’s pretty much a double-team.”</p>
      <p>Evans said other teams employ a similar scheme at times but not as “big of a dose.”</p>
      <p>“If you look up the stats, they’re probably in two-high at least 90 percent,” Evans said. “They’re a good defense. They can switch it up on you. This time they just were very basic. They were just getting after us.”</p>

      <p>Evans produced 69 yards on his four grabs, including a long of 27 late in the fourth, to move within 7 yards of joining Randy Moss as the only players to reach 1,000 yards receiving in each of their first six NFL seasons.</p>
      <p>“He’s never one-on-one against these guys,” Bucs coach Bruce Arians said. “It’s a matter of finding ways to get him balls. We did a better job in the second half.”</p>
      <p>An eventful fourth quarter saw Evans being called for offensive pass interference near the line of scrimmage, negating a 6-yard reception on a fourth-and-1 near midfield with the Bucs trailing 27-17.</p>
      <p>“It was a simple release, what every receiver in the NFL does,” Evans said. “It cost us pretty big. That’s just how it goes. The ref is a human being. He made an error.”</p>
      <p>Arians challenged the call, which stood after a video review.</p>
      <p>“I have no comments on officiating,” Arians said. “They already wrote up the letter for my file.”</p>
      <p>Evans also left the game briefly in the fourth when he had the wind knocked out of him while being tackled by Saints safety Vonn Bell.</p>

      <p>The loss dropped Tampa Bay to 3-7.</p>
      <p>“Obviously, I don’t like losing,” Evans said. “Nobody likes losing. But I’ll never stop fighting, ever. This is my job. I love doing what I do, and my teammates do as well.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to fight to the end and live with the result.”</p>
