      </p>
      <p>The Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has disclosed that the Ondo and Ekiti State Governments have concluded plan to construct toll gate on the Akure-Ado Ekiti Expressway owned by the Federal Government.</p>
      <p>According to the governor, the toll gate would be constructed after the road, a dual carriageway was completed.</p>
      <p>The Akure-Ado Ekiti road has been in a poor condition with motorists and commuters calling on the government to repair or reconstruct the road.</p>
      <p>Akeredolu, who spoke on Sunday, at a special thanksgiving service held at the Christ Apostolic Church, Mount of Monument of God’s Grace, Otapete Owo, said the project would be financed with a loan from the African Development Bank.</p>
      <p>He, however, noted that the move was awaiting presidential approval and that of the Federal Executive Council.</p>
      <p>The governor said, “When completed, this road will be tolled so as to enable the state government to have a channel of repaying monies that will be spent on it.</p>
      <p>“We have written letters to the Federal Government and we are sure that the President will sign it and it will be taken to the FEC.</p>
      <p>“We are only waiting for the approval of the FEC. The bank, African Development Bank is ready to give us loan to dualise the road and it will be tolled.”</p>
