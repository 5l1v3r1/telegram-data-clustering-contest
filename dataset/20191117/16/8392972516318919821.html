      <h2>She wanted to be a part of it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:29:23+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:29</time> by <a rel="author">Entertainment Daily</a></address>
      <p>Michelle Visage is reportedly "gutted" over not being part of the 2020 <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly</a> live tour line up.</p>
      <p>The Ru Paul Drag Race star has been a hit with viewers and the Strictly judges alike.</p>
      <p>However, she apparently hasn't made the cut for the tour. Michelle's spokeswoman is reported to have said she had been looking forward to taking part.</p>
      <p>The spokeswoman also said Michelle had been asked her availability and was waiting for the thumbs up.</p>

      <p>"She’d have loved to have done it. She was available for every date of the tour and the organisers were very aware of this," they said.</p>
      <p>"But for whatever reason, they decided not to have Michelle on."</p>
      <p>However, a TV source is reported to have told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10361974/michelle-visage-axed-from-ballroom-tour/">The Sun</a> that scheduling conflicts were behind the decision not to book her.</p>
      <p>The unnamed insider said she already agreed to be part of a fan convention in London on the opening weekend of the Strictly tour.</p>

      <p>"She wouldn’t be available for four shows in Birmingham. So to say she had cleared her diary is not true," they are reported to have said.</p>
      <p>Reality star Michelle, who previously competed on Celebrity Big Brother, had previously made no secret that she would have loved to be on the Strictly tour.</p>
      <p>She shared her disappointment to not be on the line-up last week by replying to several equally disappointed fans on Twitter.</p>
      <p>After one fan tweeted she was 'gutted' Michelle wasn't included, <a href="https://twitter.com/michellevisage/status/1193802111944929280">she replied</a>: "Me TOOOOOO I so wanted to do it!"</p>
      <p>EntertainmentDaily has contacted Michelle Visage's representative for comment.</p>
