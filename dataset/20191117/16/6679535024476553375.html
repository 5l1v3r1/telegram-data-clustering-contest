      <h1>Negi smashes fastest half-century in SMAT</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:51:01+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/G-Viswanath-839/" target="_blank">G. Viswanath</a></address>
      <p>Meghalaya’s Abhay Dhirendrasingh Negi raced to the fastest 50 — off 14 balls — in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT) at the Wankhede Stadium here on Sunday. Negi’s team, which scored 207 for four, won the match by 25 runs. Mizoram made 182 for two in 20 overs. The previous record was held by Karnataka’s Robin Uthappa, who had scored a 15-ball 50 in 19 minutes with five 4s and as many 6s against Andhra in a South Zone Twenty20 qualifier at Murugappa, Chennai on October 21, 2011.</p>
      <p>Playing his 13th Twenty20 match for Meghalaya, the Uttaranchal-born right hander bludgeoned the Mizoram attack for an unbeaten 50 with six 6s and two 4s, two 2s and two singles. Negi and Ravi Teja added 58 for the unbroken fifth wicket.</p>
      <p>Coming at the fall of Sanjay Yadav at 149 for 4 at the conclusion of the 17th over, Negi began with cut four off seamer Lalhruai Ralte and followed it with a cover driven six. He then hammered a six over cover off seamer Lalnunkima Varte before picking another seamer G. Laibiakvela for a four through cover and four consecutive 6s (long on, slash, long off and long on) in the 20th over. Negi missed connecting the last ball.</p>
      <p>It was entertainment at its best with both teams making a combined 389 runs.</p>
