      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/tarsha-whitmore/">Tarsha Whitmore</a> is showing off both her fashion sense and her killer figure in a red hot new snapshot. As those who follow her on social media know, Tarsha has a huge fan base, boasting over 640,000 fans on Instagram alone. The model travels all over the world and posts photos from her trips, but in a sizzling new snapshot, the model found herself back home in Australia.</p>
      <p>In the caption of her double-photo update, Tarsha told fans that she was starting to shop early for Christmas gifts, but she actually ended up buying a few things for herself. The model could be seen striking a pose outside against a blue-colored building. Whitmore looked nothing short of stunning, wearing her long, brunette locks down and slightly waved for the occasion. The bombshell also rocked a gorgeous application of makeup that included eyeliner, mascara, blush, highlighter, and lipgloss.</p>
      <p>Tarsha’s figure was on full display in a pair of tiny Daisy Dukes that showed off her toned and tanned stems. The model paired the look with a low-cut white tank top that she wore tucked into her shorts. Her top offered generous views of cleavage, and Tarsha completed the look with a white clutch and a pair of matching white sneakers. In the second image in the series, the model wore the same outfit, but the picture was taken at a closer angle.</p>
