      <p>Two health officials in Lagos State on Sunday advised members of the public on steps to tackle the outbreak of waterborne gastroenteritis (stomach) disease in the state.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that there has been incidences of stomach disorder that has left many children hospitalised in Ajegunle area of the state.</p>
      <p>The officials, in separate interviews with NAN in Lagos, said the preventive measure was key.</p>
      <p>TaiwoAwonuga, the President of Lagos Chapter of Environmental Health Officers Association of Nigeria, advised residents to clean and disinfect vomit and faecal spillages promptly.</p>
      <p>“We have to increase the frequency of routine environmental inspection and in cleaning, including toilets, bathrooms and the surrounding.</p>
      <p>“Particular attention has to be given to cleaning objects that are frequently touched such as faucets, door handles and bed rails.</p>
      <p>“Environmental services and waste management department personnel should wear gown, gloves and a surgical or procedure mask when cleaning surface soiled with vomitus and faecal material.</p>
      <p>“The use of approved disinfectant, freshly prepared sodium hypochlorite solution to disinfect the surface contaminated with faeces or vomitus is highly recommended,’’ Awonuga said.</p>
      <p>According to him, the reliability of disinfectant, other than those containing chlorine to kill the norovirus, is uncertain.</p>
      <p>“So, chlorine containing hypochlorite is recommended for use whenever is possible.’’</p>
      <p>Aroe Adesola, the state Public Relations Officer of EHOAN, decried the outbreak as epidemic and advised people to maintain a clean culture and ensure their homes were cross-ventilated.</p>
      <p>“Clean carpets and soft furnishing with hot water and detergents or stream clean, dry vacuuming is not recommended.</p>
      <p>“Open defecation and channelisation of faecal matters into public drain need to be discouraged out rightly, while offenders should be prosecuted.</p>
      <p>“Hand washing should be encouraged after visiting toilets and before handling of food,’’ Adesola told NAN.</p>
      <p>According to him, water samples are being collected in the affected areas for analysis at the Drug Quality Control Laboratory, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital for effective control.</p>
      <p>He enjoined the public to notify the appropriate Environmental Services/Primary Health Care Department of any suspected case.</p>
      <p>Adesola said that advocacy and health education on the importance of personal and food hygiene would be intensified. </p>
