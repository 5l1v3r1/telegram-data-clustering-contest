      <h1>Trump defends, mocks Joe Biden after North Korea calls former VP a 'rabid dog'</h1>

      <p>President Donald Trump tweeted a backhanded compliment about former Vice President Joe Biden Sunday after North Korea called the Democratic presidential candidate a "rabid dog."</p>
      <p>"Mr. Chairman," <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1196080086686011398">Trump said on Twitter</a> in an apparent reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, "Joe Biden may be Sleepy and Very Slow, but he is not a 'rabid dog.'"</p>

      <p>South Korea's Yonhap News Agency speculated that by insulting Biden North Korea was trying to appeal to Trump.</p>
      <p>The president has continued to describe his personal relationship with Kim in positive terms despite a stalemate in nuclear talks.</p>
      <p>He repeated that sentiment Sunday, urging Kim to "act quickly, get the deal done."</p>
      <p>"See you soon!" he added.</p>
      <p>Biden, in contrast, has been a frequent target of Trump's insults.</p>
      <p>Trump's feud with Biden is at the center of the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/Trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry into the president</a>, which is focused in part on whether the Trump administration demanded Ukraine investigate the former vice president and his son in exchange for U.S. military aid.</p>
      <p>Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency had lashed out against Biden Friday, saying he "must be beaten to death with a stick."</p>
      <p>The commentary said the presidential hopeful "reeled off a string of rubbish against the dignity" of the North's leadership, an act it said deserves "merciless punishment."</p>
      <p>It wasn't immediately clear which of Biden's comments provoked North Korea's anger.</p>
      <p>The Democrat has accused Trump of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/trump-befriends-another-strongman-world-stage-n985306">cozying up to embattled foreign leaders</a>and has been highly critical of his diplomacy with Kim, calling the meetings "three made-for-TV summits."</p>
      <p>North Korea similarly criticized Biden in May, labeling him a "fool of low IQ" after Biden called Kim a tyrant during a speech.</p>
