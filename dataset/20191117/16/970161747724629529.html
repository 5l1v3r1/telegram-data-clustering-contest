      <p>A medical secretary who was fired from her job because she could not use a computer has been awarded £200,000 in damages after suing the NHS for age discrimination.</p>
      <p>Eileen Jolly, 89, said she felt ‘humiliated’ when she was escorted out of the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading in January 2017.</p>
      <p>Managers at the Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust claimed she was ‘stuck’ in old secretarial ways and dismissed her over an apparent ‘catastrophic failure in performance’.</p>
      <p>But an employment tribunal ruled that her case was ‘tainted by discrimination’ and she was offered a settlement worth £200,000 by the trust.</p>
      <p>The sum is one of the largest ever awarded.</p>

      <p>Mrs Jolly, who suffers from a heart condition and has arthritis said she had trouble sleeping and was prescribed anti-depressants after she was sacked.</p>

      <p>The tribunal was told that she hid the news from her late husband and the rest of her family, telling them she had retired because she felt a ‘deep sense of shame’.</p>
      <p>She was admitted to hospital with tachycardia after reading a report from her managers who made hurtful comments about her age and health, the tribunal heard.</p>
      <p>Judge Andrew Gumbiti-Zimuto said training given to Mrs Jolly was not adequate and that no further training was offered.</p>
      <p>His judgment read: ‘The role that the claimant understood she was performing, she was performing competently. There is a suspicion of the claimant being a scapegoat, the claimant was not offered training where it might be considered appropriate.’</p>
      <p>Mrs Jolly’s complaints of unfair dismissal, age discrimination, disability discrimination and breach of contract were upheld.</p>

      <p>The NHS accepted it unfairly dismissed her by not allowing her an appeal but insisted its decision to sack her was justified on the grounds of capability.</p>
      <p>Papers showing the breakdown of Mrs Jolly’s pay out show she was given a basic award of £12,956.34 and £71,472.64 for unfair dismissal.</p>
      <p>She was also awarded £20,000 for injury to feelings and £350 for loss of statutory right.</p>
      <p>The trust also paid £1,727.52 for failing to provide written particulars and £22,868.16 for non-compliance with the ACAS code</p>
      <p>In total, the document states the gross amount owed to Mrs Jolly is £200,000.</p>
