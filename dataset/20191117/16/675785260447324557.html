      <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo misses out on 100th strike for Portugal despite 'stealing' goal</h1>
      <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo must wait to reach a century of goals for Portugal despite finding the net against Luxembourg late on in their Euro 2020 qualifier.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:05:08+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:05</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo must wait to become the second player in history to reach 100 international goals - despite a cheeky attempt to reach the milestone.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> superstar Ronaldo, 34, went into Portugal's clash with Luxembourg on 98 goals.</p>
      <p>And he controversially snatched his 99th in the 86th minute by poking the ball into the net when it was already on its way across the line courtesy of substitute Diogo Jota.</p>
      <p>After a goal which fans said he "stole" from his team-mate, he was frantically aiming for a second late strike to bring up his century.</p>
      <p>But his wait must go on after a game which still saw Portugal secure their spot at next summer's tournament.</p>

      <p>The encounter was the European champions' final qualifier as they bid to retain their crown next summer.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo was aiming to follow in the footsteps of Iranian legend Ali Daei, who managed 109 international goals in just 149 games.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo made his Portugal debut against Kazakhstan in August 2003, just a week after signing for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>

      <p>He scored the first of his international goals at Euro 2004 against eventual winners Greece in the group stage of the tournament.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo, who was made permanent captain in 2008, has gone on to score in every tournament for Portugal since then and led his country to Euro 2016 glory.</p>

      <p>Last summer, he also played a key role in Portugal's UEFA Nations League success.</p>
      <p>He scored another hat-trick against Lithuania on Thursday night to put him within touching distance of the century.</p>

      <p>Ronaldo has been played sparingly by both club and country in recent times with Juventus boss Maurizio Sarri claiming he is struggling with an injury.</p>
      <p>But those claims appear wide of the mark, with Ronaldo continuing to shine for his country.</p>
      <p>There are suggestions he will retire from international football after the European Championships next summer, and could call it a day altogether.</p>

      <p>“Maybe I can finish my career next year... but I can also play up to 40 or 41," he said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know. What I always say is to enjoy the moment. The gift is excellent and I have to continue to enjoy it.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there are any footballers who have more records than me.”</p>
