      <h1>ESPN: 8 Teams Are On The College Football Playoff “Bubble”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:56:18+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>With Minnesota and Baylor both losing on Saturday, there are now only three undefeated teams remaining in FBS: LSU, Ohio State and Clemson. Those three teams are locks for the College Football Playoff as long as they win out.</p>
      <p>But beyond those three, just about everything is up in the air in competition for the fourth College Football Playoff spot.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, ESPN Senior Writer Heather Dinich <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/page/RoadtoChamp111719/college-football-playoff-rankings-race-no-4-spot-heats-up">ranked eight teams that are on the bubble</a> for the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>Here are the teams:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No. 4 Georgia</li>
        <li>No. 5 Alabama</li>
        <li>No. 6 Oregon</li>
        <li>No. 7 Utah</li>
        <li>No. 8 Minnesota</li>
        <li>No. 9 Penn State</li>
        <li>No. 10 Oklahoma</li>
        <li>No. 13 Baylor</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s worth noting that seven of those teams are contenders for their respective conference titles. Florida and Auburn, who are ranked higher than Baylor but not in contention for the SEC title, were left out.</p>
      <p>Alabama still makes the list because outside of their loss to LSU, they’ve dominated just about everyone.</p>
      <p>But it currently looks like Georgia controls its own destiny. Winning out and beating LSU in the SEC Championship Game will ensure a spot in the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>Then, of course, the conversation shifts to what happens to LSU. Would a one-loss SEC title runner-up in LSU be jumped by a one-loss Pac-12 or Big 12 title winner?</p>
      <p>It’s going to be an exciting race to the finish line to be sure.</p>
