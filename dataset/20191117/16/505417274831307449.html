        <b>It was another busy day in the GAA club calendar with the finalists for the 2019 Munster football and Leinster hurling championships now known.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After their memorable win over Cuala, Carlow’s St Mullins kept their dream campaign going with a dramatic injury-time winner over Rathdowney-Errill. They now progress to meet Ballyhale Shamrocks in the Leinster club hurling final.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Nemo Rangers and Clonmel Commercials will meet again in the Munster football final following respective wins over Austin Stacks and Miltown-Malbay.</p>
      <p>Following Naomh Conaill’s win in the Ulster semi-final last night, Kilcoo of Down booked their place in the decider following a two-point win over Derrygonnelly.</p>
      <p>Catch up on all the day’s action from the AIB Club Championships in our round-up below.</p>

      <h3>Munster club SFC semi-finals</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Miltown-Malbay</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Miltown-Malbay 0-7 Clonmel Commercials 0-9</i>
      </p>
      <p>A late flurry of points ensured it was Tipperary champions Clonmel Commercials who advance to the Munster club senior football final after a two-point victory over last year’s beaten finalists Miltown Malbay.</p>

      <p>Commercials left themselves with a lot of work to do at the break as they trailed by four points thanks to early points from Oisin Looney and Conor Cleary for Miltown.</p>
      <p>A late string of points from Conal, Jack and Seamus Kennedy saw Commercials push past the hosts and into the Munster final for the first time since 2015.</p>

        <b>Pairc Ui Rinn</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Nemo Rangers 2-17 Austin Stacks 0-5</i>
      </p>
      <p>2017 champions Nemo Rangers have eased into the Munster final following a comprehensive victory over Kerry’s Austin Stacks in Pairc Ui Rinn this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Remarkably, all of Nemo’s scores were from play and a goal from Kevin O’Donovan saw the Cork side build up a substantial lead of 10 points by the break.</p>

      <p>It was much the same story when the sides emerged with Alan O’Donovan’s goal midway through the second half setting up the 18-point victory.</p>

      <h3>Ulster club SFC semi-final</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Athletic Grounds</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Derrygonnelly 0-9 Kilcoo 1-8</i>
      </p>
      <p>Kilcoo will meet Naomh Conaill in the Ulster senior football final after the Down champions registered a two-point win over Derrygonnelly of Fermanagh.</p>

      <p>Aaron Branagan’s goal in the 37th minute put some distance between the sides after a tight opening half and Ryan McEvoy’s point immediately after looked to have put Kilcoo firmly in the driving seat.</p>
      <p>Both sides were reduced to 14 men when Lee Jones and Jerome Johnston picked up second yellows. A point from Derrygonnelly’s Garvan Jones left just the goal between the sides heading into injury time and the Fermanagh side kicked on to reduce the gap to just one point. However, it was Kilcoo who had the final say in the game and they march on to the provincial final.</p>

      <h3>Leinster club SHC semi-final</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Netwatch Cullen Park</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>St Mullins 2-17 Rathdowney-Errill 1-19</i>
      </p>
      <p>An injury-time point from James Doyle ensured St Mullins dream run in the club championship continues as they secured a narrow one-point victory over Laois champions Rathdowney-Errill.</p>

      <p>Carlow star Marty Kavanagh registered 1-9 for St Mullins who overcame the concession of a first-half goal to Laois captain Paddy Purcell. Paddy Boland and Kavanagh responded with goals for Mullins to leave the sides level at the break.</p>
      <p>There was nothing to separate the sides in the second half with Mark Kavanagh leading the way for Rathdowney. Though the Carlow champions went on a late scoring spree, Ross King levelled the game before Shane Madden gave Rathdowney the lead to ensure a grandstand finish. Two points from Doyle was enough to ensure Mullins progress to the Leinster club final.</p>
