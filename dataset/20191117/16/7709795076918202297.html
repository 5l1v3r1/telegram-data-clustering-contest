        <b>Hang In There lives up to his name with victory in the Grade Two Sky Bet Supreme Trial Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Enhancing the fine recent run of form for trainer Emma Lavelle and jockey Adam Wedge, the front-running Hang In There had his rivals in trouble two hurdles from the finish and stuck to his task well to score by three lengths.</p>
      <p>Successful at Exeter on his second start since being bought out of Mags Mullins' stable for Â£60,000 in the spring, Lavelle's charge ran out a decisive winner.</p>
      <p>The prolific Pacify put in a brave effort in second conceding 5lb to the winner, while the well-backed Ecco was slightly disappointing, finishing 14 lengths further back in third.</p>
      <p>Lavelle said: "He is an easy mover and I wasn't sure about the ground, but he has handled this the same as he has handled better ground. He is always on the gas at home and is busy enough.</p>
      <p>"He is all heart and he will keep fighting for you. Distance-wise I think we will stick to where we are, but I think he is a nice one. You have to say he acts on the track. To be in with a chance of these championship races over two miles you have got to be able to stay.</p>
      <p>"He only just got beat in a two-and-a-half-mile novice at Fairyhouse before we bought him. We know he will get a trip, but he has got the pace as well. He doesn't have to make it, but it is better to let him get on with it than fight it.</p>
      <p>"He is an exciting prospect and has done nothing wrong. I suppose (could look at the Tolworth). We started off on good ground at Exeter, so I was expecting he would want better ground and he could be one that is versatile.</p>
      <p>"I think for the minute we will see how he comes out of this and make a plan. Once you get to this stage the races pick themselves."</p>
      <p>Sponsors Sky Bet introduced the winner at 25/1 for the Supreme back here in March and PR manager Michael Shinners said: "I'm sure we'll see more impressive winners in the build-up to the Sky Bet Supreme at the Festival but take nothing away from Hang In There who jumps well, travels and has the right attitude. He beat the form horse in Pacify and we think he's worth his place in the market at 25s."</p>
