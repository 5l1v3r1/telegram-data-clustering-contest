      <h4>Kim Kardashian looked confident and stylish in a new Instagram pic she posted that shows her strutting her stuff during a fitting in a metallic silver mini dress on Nov. 16.</h4>
      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/kim-kardashian/"><b>Kim Kardashian</b></a>, 39, knows how to wear a <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/10/24/kim-kardashian-almost-has-wardrobe-malfunction-sexy-top-pic/">mini dress</a>! The <i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</i> star shared a very flattering photo with her Instagram followers on Nov. 16 and in it, she modeled a gorgeous metallic silver number that perfectly hugged her figure. The brunette beauty confidently posed in front of a rack of clothing while modeling the dress, which had a lower neckline, and paired it with see-through heels. She posed with her head tiled to one side and gave the camera a serious and confident look. “Fittings 👗✨,” she captioned the post.</p>
      <p>Kim’s photo impressed both family and fans and was met with a lot of compliments in the comments section. “Wow,” younger sister <b>Khloe Kardashian</b>, 35, wrote. “So pretty,” a fan comment read while others called her “beautiful” and left her heart-eyed emojis. “This dress is amazing,” another read.</p>
      <p>Although Kim didn’t specify what she was getting fitted for, the positive response she received clearly shows it doesn’t matter because her fans already have a high opinion of her! Perhaps she was preparing for a promotion or event of some kind, but we’ll just have to wait and see. The mother-of-four recently stunned in an ad for her new shapewear line SKIMS. The <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/16/kim-kardashian-sexy-body-suit-skims-pic/">Nov. 15 photo</a> showed her wearing a black bodysuit from the collection and leaning back in a yoga-like position while outside. “I know it feels like we’ve been out of stock for a long time but I am so excited to announce that we are finally restocking our original @skims Solutionwear™ on Wednesday, November 20th at 9am PST / 12pm EST,” she gushed to her fans in the caption.</p>

      <p>Not many people can even stun during just a fitting for a dress, but Kim is definitely one who can! We look forward to seeing what she was getting fitted for in the near future!</p>
