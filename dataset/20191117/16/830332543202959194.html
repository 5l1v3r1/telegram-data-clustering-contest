      <p>(WITI) - Seven Popeyes employees were fired after a brawl at a Milwaukee restaurant was caught on camera.</p>
      <p>Richard Fourte went inside the Popeyes Wednesday night to avoid the drive-thru lane. He noticed a lot of employees working there before things became heated. </p>
      <p>Fourte heard someone yell, "It's a fight!" before they ran back to the grills. Then, he said, "two guys start fighting again." He started recording with his cellphone as a violent fight broke out, with chairs flying and several employees throwing punches.</p>
      <p>"It was just out of control," Fourte said. "That was the first thing that went through my head, like this is out of control."</p>
      <p>He can be heard on the video telling them to break it up soon. After the situation cooled off, Fourte left the restaurant empty-handed.</p>
      <p>"Honestly, I wasn't even going to get the chicken sandwich, you know," Fourte said. </p>
      <p>Popeyes franchise owner John Broderson released the following statement to Fox6:</p>
      <p>"This was an unfortunate, isolated incident which we take very seriously. The dining room was closed immediately after the altercation at 9:30pm. As a result of this, 7 employees were terminated from the Company, including the manager on duty."</p>
      <p>Milwaukee police responded to the scene, but no arrests were made. It is still unclear what sparked the fight.</p>
