      <p>Celebrity foodie <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/ayesha-curry/">Ayesha Curry</a> recently shared an Instagram update with her 6.8 million followers in which she showcased the outfit she wore for an appearance on QVC.</p>
      <p>In the snap, Ayesha perched on a stone ledge with a large silver ‘Q’ on it, and the letters ‘QVC’ in the middle of the statue. Behind her was a large building covered in glass panels, with the front doors of the building visible. Ayesha rocked a vibrant yellow top that hugged her curves, and a pair of dark plaid pants. She kept her footwear casual, wearing white Converse sneakers. Ayesha covered up her outfit with a soft gray jacket that appeared to be crafted from a fuzzy material that was perfect for combating the winter chill.</p>
      <p>Ayesha’s hair was down and curly, and she rocked a pair of small hoop earrings. She went bold with her lip color, opting for a vibrant pink shade, and she had a huge smile on her face in the photo. She posed with one hand pointing at the statue, clearly excited to be on-air. She explained in the caption of the post that she was there to talk about the debut of her marble cookware collection.</p>
      <p>She also included a link to her products on the QVC website in her Instagram bio, in case her followers wanted to pick up a few of her other kitchen pieces.</p>
