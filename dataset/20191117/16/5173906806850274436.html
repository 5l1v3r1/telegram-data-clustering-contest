        <b>The Consumer Protection Association (DECO) detected delays and cancellation of West Line trains, and concluded that "a quality public service is not being provided" in the Sintra-Figueira da Foz rail service</b>
      </p>
      <p>"The West Line is subject to delays and train cancellations caused by the lack of rolling stock and lack of human resources," said DECO.</p>
      <p>Following several complaints from passengers, DECO visited stations and platforms on the West Line and concluded, "passengers areconstantly subject to the uncertainty of whether or not there is a train. They do not have any information, since the vast majority of stations are closed, have no staff and there is no electronic timetabling service".</p>
      <p>DECO advocates the complete modernisation of the entire line, the replacement of rolling stock and the rehabilitation and reopening of stations, increasing staff numbers, adapting spaces for people with reduced mobility and installing electronic information systems for timetables and changes to services.</p>
      <p>In July, the company Infraestruturas de Portugal (IP) launched a tender for €68.5 million for the modernization of the West Line between Sintra and Torres Vedras, with an execution period of two years, starting from its consignment, and the deadline for submission of proposals is still running, said today IP's official source.</p>
      <p>Awaiting for decades and several times postponed, the project to modernize the century-old line is budgeted at a total of €112.4 million and foresees a second contract between Torres Vedras and Caldas da Rainha, which IP expects to launch by the end of this year.</p>
      <p>The project covers 87 of the 200 kilometres of the West Line, including electrification and duplication of track, rectification of curves, creation of variants to the current route, suppression of level crossings and their replacement by passages above or below the railway line, and the installation of signalling at stations and pedestrian crossings.</p>
      <p>The total contract work is largely financed by community funds and crosses the municipalities of Sintra, Mafra, Sobral de Monte Agraço, Torres Vedras, Cadaval (Lisbon district), Bombarral, Óbidos and Caldas da Rainha (Leiria).</p>
