      <p>James Arthur has quit Twitter after being “hurt” by trolls online.</p>
      <p>The singer, 31, said some of the abuse directed at him had gone too far and told trolls that if that was their aim, they had won.</p>
      <p>Arthur – who has previously spoken about his experience of depression and anxiety – tweeted on Sunday: “Have to be honest some of the things I read on here go a bit too far and quite frankly f***** hurt, if that was your goal you win.</p>
      <p>“Maybe I should have thicker skin at this point I don’t know but either way this is my last tweet, I’m loggin off.</p>
      <p>“Peace out Twitter friends.”</p>

      <p>“Thanks for all the love and support shown by fans on this platform over the years it’s been emotional but I’ve gotta delete this app.</p>
      <p>“Much love and respect JA.”</p>
      <p>Arthur rose to fame in 2012 when he won the ninth series of The X Factor.</p>
