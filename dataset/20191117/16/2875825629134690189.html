      <h2>Simon Mignolet left Liverpool in the summer after spending six years at Anfield as he joined Belgium giants Club Brugge. The keeper cites Alisson's performances as a reason for his exit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:47:48+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:47</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Simon Mignolet has revealed that he left Liverpool because he didn't feel he could fight Alisson for the No.1 shirt.</p>
      <p>Belgian keeper Mignolet departed the Reds to join Club Brugge, where he has played 20 times already this season, in the summer for £6.4million having spent six years at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Mignolet joined from Sunderland in 2013 and was the Reds' first choice shot stopper for his first three seasons before Loris Karius and then Brazilian Alisson challenged and overtook him.</p>
      <p>Alisson, who arrived from Roma in 2018, has been one of the main reason's behind Liverpool's success - with Jurgen Klopp's side becoming a difficult side to score against.</p>

      <p>And Mignolet has admitted that he had to depart Merseyside due to Alisson's dominance, with Adrian also arriving this summer.</p>
      <p>“If I could really fight for my place, I might have stayed. But if I had ended up in goal if Alisson picked up injury, I would be allowed to push ten shots out of the box,” Mignolet told <a href="https://www.hbvl.be/">Het Belang van Limburg</a> (via <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/indeed-battling-with-liverpool-star-was-difficult-for-player-doesnt-regret-decision-to-leave-anfield/">Sport Witness).</a></p>
      <p>“Then Alisson could immediately claim his place again. And even if he pushed the ball into his own goal, he would still retain [his place in the starting XI]. What sense did it make for me?”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> are top of the Premier League, and boast an eight point lead over second placed <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> , and nine points to last year's champions <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>But despite the huge successes which appear to be on the horizon at Anfield, Mignolet doesn't regret leaving the club.</p>
      <p>"No, because I knew that the opportunity existed. I haven’t thought once: ‘S**t, now Liverpool is in the Premier League race and I’m gone.’</p>
      <p>"Of course, I could have stayed with Liverpool to earn my money, challenge for the league title and the Champions League,” Mignolet said.</p>
      <p>“However, as long as you are not on the starting XI yourself, a price feels different. So I would rather play in the starter at Club Brugge than grabbing the English title as a substitute at Liverpool.”</p>
