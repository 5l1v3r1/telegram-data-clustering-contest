      <p>Lowndes County Animal Services Officer Jeff Atkison said he was sent to an area near the Florida state line after a motorist reported the disabled bird, the <a href="https://www.valdostadailytimes.com/news/local_news/injured-bald-eagle-found-in-lowndes/article_4d9f1d41-ca76-5702-83e0-f54fdcbaf02b.html">Valdosta Daily Times</a> reported.</p>

      <p>Atkison said he was helped by licensed trapper Marshall Locher, of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Lochersreptiles/">Locher's Reptiles</a>, who kept the eagle contained until an officer from the <a href="https://gadnr.org/">Georgia Department of Natural Resources</a> arrived, the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>The wildlife official took the bird to Quaifwood Animal Hospital in Tifton to be examined by a veterinarian, Lowndes County officials told the <a href="https://www.valdostadailytimes.com/news/local_news/injured-bald-eagle-found-in-lowndes/article_4d9f1d41-ca76-5702-83e0-f54fdcbaf02b.html">Daily Times</a>.</p>
      <p>The eagle is in protective care at Auburn University’s Southeastern Raptor Center, the newspaper reported. Lowndes County officials named the bird Moody, in a nod to the personnel at Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta, the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>Bald eagles are no longer a federally endangered species but were added as endangered species to Georgia’s Protected Wildlife List in 1974.</p>
