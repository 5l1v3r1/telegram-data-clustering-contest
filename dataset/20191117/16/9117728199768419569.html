        <b>Six time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton says that he is not bothered if he never receives a knighthood for his career, saying that he doesn't think it is ever going to happen. Hamilton is by far the most successful British F1 driver, and won his sixth title last week.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 34-year old has an MBE but believes that he will never receive the ultimate honour of a knighthood. F1 drivers such as Jackie Stewart, Jack Brabham and Stirling Moss, but Hamilton is not confident of becoming the next addition to that list, despite his incredible achievements.</p>

      <p>He said ahead of the Brazilian Grand Prix:Â <i>"I don't think it is going to happen. But that doesn't bother me.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"It doesn't mean I am not British, and I will continue to try and raise the flag as well as I can.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Just the fact that people have mentioned it, is an honour, but I have not spent my life chasing it. It is just not something you grow up thinking of.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"But if it did happen I don't know how I would handle it. I have stood in front of Her Majesty the Queen before and it was incredible. She really is awesome."</i>
