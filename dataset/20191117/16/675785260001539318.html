      <h1>How to get fit at any age with Mr Motivator's 10-minute home workout routine</h1>
      <h2>TV star and fitness guru Mr Motivator, now 67, was horrified to hear that nearly eight out of 10 pensioners believe they’re too old to keep fit - here he explains why everyone can be active with this exclusive new workout, as told to Hannah Britt here...</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:46:25+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:46</time> by <a rel="author">Mr Motivator</a></address>
      <p>People of the UK, it’s time to get moving! When I heard  in a recent survey of 1,000 ­pensioners by Everyone Active that 78% said they felt too old to keep fit, I knew I had to step in.</p>
      <p>Being active can change your life for ever – and it’s never too late to start.</p>
      <p>Believe me when I say that exercise really is the best medicine.</p>
      <p>You’ll stand up straighter, your balance will improve and you’ll have more energy. Best of all – you’ll live longer.</p>
      <p>I am living testament to how beneficial exercise can be. At 67 I am fitter than ever. In fact, I work out more now than I did when I was 40 – and I built a career in fitness.</p>
      <p>Most days I train for an hour – aerobics, weight- training, sit-ups, standing, running – you name it, I do it. As does my wife Sandra who is 63.</p>
      <p>Once you make it a habit, working out becomes as natural as brushing your teeth. And if you don’t brush your teeth, you don’t feel right, do you?</p>
      <p>That’s how it should feel to skip your daily exercise. So if you think fitness is not for you, I’m here to change your mind.</p>
      <p>I believe your later years are the ideal time to get more active. You don’t have to go to work, you don’t have to look after your kids – you have far more time on your hands. So why not put it to good use and get moving?</p>
      <h3>Why exercise?</h3>
      <p>Exercise helps prolong independence and ensures that we can still do the things we took for granted when we were younger.</p>
      <p>There are endless social benefits too. You’ll forge new friendships <br/>while active – walking in a group, going to a dance class or taking ­swimming lessons are all great ways to meet people.</p>
      <p>It also provides a mental boost, reducing stress and anxiety while increasing self-esteem and confidence.</p>
      <h3>How to start</h3>
      <p>Getting started is the hardest thing, especially if it’s something you’ve never <br/>done before.</p>
      <p>So create an environment that is motivating. First, put music on that will make you want to move and dance.</p>
      <p>Buy a pair of trainers and keep them somewhere you can see them. When they’re on show, you’ll want to put them on.</p>
      <p>When you’re in your slippers, you want to put your feet up. With trainers on, you’re ready to go. So let’s do this!</p>
      <h3>THE 10-MIN AT-HOME WORKOUT</h3>
      <p>For a full-body boost that improves cardio fitness, strength and conditioning, try these simple exercises for one minute each every day.</p>
      <p>Have confidence in yourself. You can do it. But make sure to listen to your body. Anything that causes discomfort, just stop.</p>
