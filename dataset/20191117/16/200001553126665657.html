      <h1>Manchester City official travels to Spain – Possibility of interest in emerging Brazil talent</h1>

      <p>It’s not an average week if Manchester City aren’t linked to a young talent somewhere in the world and this week has been no different.</p>
      <p>The Premier League champions scout talent around the world daily, and this international break has them in Gran Canaria.</p>
      <p>The island is hosting the Tenerife Tournament, an event that’s been planned so that the South American teams can prepare for the 2020 CONMEBOL Pre-Olympic Tournament and City are there.</p>
      <p>Brazil, Argentina, Chile and USA are all competing, and <a href="https://www.record.pt/">Record</a> reports that several clubs all have scouts in attendance.</p>
      <p>Manchester City are among them, according to the newspaper.</p>
      <p>There’s no mention of who they may have been there to watch, although it’s likely they’ll keep a close eye on Brazil.</p>
      <p>That country is a hot-bed of talent, and Manchester City have had success with Gabriel Jesus and would love to replicate that in future.</p>

      <p>Record, though, believe it’s just a case of opportunism. They explain accreditation for the tournament was open and the chance to see Brazil vs Argentina was probably too big to turn down.</p>
      <p>If you happen to see Manchester City linked with a lesser known Under 23 player from either Brazil, Argentina, Chile or the USA, though, there’s every chance this is where they discovered them.</p>
