      <h1>Listen to Michael Jolley's X-rated rant with 58 swear words that 'cost him Grimsby job'</h1>
      <h2>The 42-year-old used the f-word 58 times in a four-minute private conversation with BBC Humberside reporters which reportedly cost him his job at Blundell Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:00:58+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>Michael Jolley was sacked from his role as manager of Grimsby Town after club chiefs were left shocked by his expletive rant at local radio journalists, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The Mariners parted company with Jolley on Friday after a run of seven games without a win left the club 18th in the League Two table.</p>
      <p>However <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7694937/amp/Jolley-lost-job-Grimsby-shocking-interview-local-radio-station.html?__twitter_impression=true">the Mail report</a> that the decision to axe their manager came after Jolley launched into a foul-mouthed tirade at BBC Humberside journalists Matt Dean and John Tondeur.</p>
      <p>Jolley used the f-word 58 times during the private conversation which occurred after Grimsby's 4-0 defeat at home to Leyton Orient last month.</p>
      <p>Footage of the exchange has been leaked on social media, in which Jolley said to Dean: "You are a f***ing disgrace.</p>

      <p>"Every time you interview me you're antagonistic, confrontational, who do you think you are, Jeremy Paxman? You are a f***ing disgrace of a journalist. The f***ing radio station gives us f***ing no positive coverage whatsoever."</p>
      <p>The loss to Orient was Grimsby's sixth on the bounce, which had begun with a 7-1 hammering to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> in the Carabao Cup.</p>
      <p>Jolley added: "F***ing you and f***ing Gwilym [Lloyd] criticise us for playing man-for-man (marking) at Chelsea.</p>
      <p>"I go on the Monday night show with Rob [Staton, Humberside sports editor] because he's a professional journalist and he's a f***ing straight shooter and you don't f***ing ask me a question or when I go off you say 'yeah, it was the wrong decision to play man-for-man'.</p>

      <p>"Why not ask the manager? Because you've got no f***ing b*****ks, you have to snipe behind peoples' f***ing backs."</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old took charge of the club in March 2018, before leading Grimsby to safety and a 17th-placed finish.</p>
      <p>Despite the damaging defeat to Orient, Jolley defended his performance.</p>
      <p>"We were f***ing 10th going into today, mate. Near the f***ing play-offs and have you seen our f***ing budget? Have you seen our budget. Do you know where we f***ing should be?"</p>
      <p>The outburst came as a surprise to members of the first team, while club officials including majority shareholder John Fenty were dismayed by his actions.</p>
      <p>A draw away at Cambridge United followed just a few days after, before Jolley was removed from his post.</p>
      <p>Grimsby said at the time of his sacking they "would like to place on record its thanks to Michael for his hard work and efforts since joining the club during a difficult period".</p>
