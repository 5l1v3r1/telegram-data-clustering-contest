      <p>Before we go any further, we should note that most  <b>international</b><b>  athletic  commissions don’t release fighter pay info, so none of the following salary data for the event is official.  </b>However, you can get a fairly accurate picture of a fighter’s pay based on official purse info released from past fights.  So, based on that info, here is the estimated pay breakdown for the 24 fighters that traded blows at the event.  But please remember – this is only an estimate, not official info.</p>
