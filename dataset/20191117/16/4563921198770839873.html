      <h1>Why German car giant Volkswagen should drop Turkey</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:00:09+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Iveta Cherneva</a></address>
      <p>War and aggression are not only questions of ethics and humanitarian disaster. They are bad news for business.</p>
      <p>The German car giant Volkwagen whose business model is built on consumer appeal had <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/15/business/volkswagen-plant-turkey/index.html">to stop and pause</a> when Turkey attacked the Kurds in Syria. A USD 1.4bln Volkswagen investment in a new plant in Turkey is being put on hold by the management, and rightly so.</p>
      <p>Unlike business areas more or less immune from consumer pressure – like some financial sectors, for example – car buying is a people thing. It is done by regular people who follow the news and don’t want to stimulate and associate themselves with crimes against humanity and war crimes through their purchases. Investing in a militarily aggressive country simply is bad for an international brand.</p>
      <p>As soon as the news hit that Turkey would be starting their military invasion against the Kurds, questions about <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2019/10/07/trump-s-support-for-erdogan-s-plans-in-syria-has-green-lit-a-turkish-genocide-of-the-kurds">plans for genocide</a> appeared in the public discourse space. Investing over a billion in such a political climate does not make sense.</p>
      <p>By investing into a new plant next to Turkish city Izmir, Volkswagen is not risking security so much. Izmir itself is far removed from Turkey’s southern border — although terrorist attacks in the current environment are generally not out of the question.</p>
      <p>The risk question rather lies elsewhere. Business likes stability and predictability. Aggressive economic sanctions which are likely to be imposed on Turkey by the EU and the US would affect many economic and business aspects which the company has to factor in. Two weeks ago the US House of Representatives already voted to impose sanctions on Turkey, which now leaves the Senate to vote on an identical resolution.</p>
      <p>Economic sanctions affect negatively the purchasing power of the population. And Volkswagen’s new business would rely greatly on the Turkish client in a market of over 80mln people.</p>
      <p>Sanctions also have a psychological “buckle-up” effect on customers in economies “under siege”, whereby clients are less likely to want to splurge on a new car in strenuous times.</p>
      <p>Volkswagen is a German but also a European company. Its decision will signal clearly if it lives by the EU values of support for human rights, or it decides to look the other way and put business first.</p>
      <p>But is not only about reputational damage, which Volkswagen seems to be concerned with. There are real business counter-arguments which coincide with anti-war concerns.</p>
      <p>Dogus Otomotiv, the Turkish distributor of VW vehicles, fell as much as 6.5% in Istanbul trading after the news for the Turkish offensive.</p>
      <p>Apart from their effects on the Turkish consumer, economic sanctions will also likely keep Turkey away from international capital markets.</p>
      <p>There is also the question of an EU company investing outside the EU, which has raised eyebrows. It is up to the European Commission now to decide whether the Volkswagen deal in Turkey can go forward after a complaint was filed. Turkey offered the German conglomerate a generous 400mln euro subsidy which is a problem when it comes to the EU rules and regulations on competition.</p>
      <p>The Chairman of the EPP Group in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber <a href="https://bnr.bg/en/post/101174092/manfred-weber-volkswagen-deal-with-turkey-is-to-the-detriment-of-bulgaria">filed a complaint</a> with the EU competition Commissioner about the deal, on the basis of non-compliance with EU competition rules. Turkey’s plans to subsidize Volkswagen clearly run counter EU rules and the EU Commission can stop the 1bln deal, if it so decides.</p>
      <p>In a context where Turkey takes care of 4mln refugees — subject to an agreement with the EU — and often threatens the EU that it would “open the gates”, it is not clear if the Commission would muster the guts to say no, however. In that sense, the German company’s own decision to pull from the deal would be welcome because the Commission itself wouldn’t have to pronounce on the issue and risk angering Turkey.</p>
      <p>While some commentators <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/vw-delays-decision-to-open-plant-in-turkey/a-50835543">do not believe</a> that Volkswagen would scrap altogether the investment and is only delaying the decision, it is worth remembering that the Syria conflict is a complex, multi-player conflict which has gone on for more than 8 years. Turkey’s entry in Syria is unlikely to end in a month. Erdogan has communicated his intention to stay in Syria until the Kurds back down.</p>
      <p>In October it was reported that the Turkish forces are already using chemical weapons on the Kurdish population which potentially makes Turkish President Erdogan a war criminal. For a corporate giant like Volkswagen, giving an economic boost for such a state would mean indirectly supporting war crimes.</p>
      <p>As Kurdish forces struck a deal for protection with the Syrian Assad forces, this seems to be anything but a slow-down. Turkey has just thrown a whole lot of wood into the fire.</p>
      <p>Volkswagen will find itself “monitoring” the situation for a long time. There is a case for making the sustainable business decision to drop the risky deal altogether, soon.</p>
