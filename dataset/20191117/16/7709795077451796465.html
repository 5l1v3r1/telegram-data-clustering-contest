        <b>The Henry De Bromhead-trained mare Put The Kettle On won the Arkle Trophy Trial Novices' Chase at Cheltenham under a fine, front-running ride from Aidan Coleman.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The outsider of the four runners (6/1) took them along in the testing conditions at Prestbury Park and she ground out success from the Nigel Twiston-Davies-trained 7/4 market leader Al Dancer by two and a half lengths.</p>
      <p>The strong-travelling Getaway Trump, representing champion trainer Paul Nicholls, made a late mistake which knocked the stuffing out of him and he once again failed to fully convince with his finishing effort up the hill.</p>
      <p>Harry Cobden's mount finished a couple of lengths ahead of Harry Whittington's Rouge Vif in last.</p>

      <p>Put The Kettle On is a <b><a href="https://m.skybet.com/horse-racing/cheltenham/event/23693295?aff=681&amp;dcmp=SL_ED_RACING_171119">20/1 chance with Sky Bet</a></b> for the Racing Post Arkle Trophy at the Cheltenham Festival in March.</p>
      <p>De Bromhead was at Punchestown, where he said: "I'm delighted and it was a great ride by Aidan. All her owners were going over. They've had a lot of fun with her and Mary Darmody, the matriarch of the syndicate, specifically went over. The lads go for the weekend every year.</p>
      <p>"She loves jumping. We said we'd drop her back over two miles and let her rock and roll, and she really enjoyed it."</p>
      <p>Coleman said: "She was super and jumped exceptionally - on that ground it's not all about the spectacular outside-the-wings (jumps), which she had if she wanted to, but she was very economical, which made a difference.</p>
      <p>"She seemed fine on the ground, she seemed to cope with it very well. There was no fluke about it, she had the allowances but she won well."</p>
      <p>Paul Nicholls said of Getaway Trump: "He ran well, but he just hated the ground. He missed the second-last and that cost him today. A good jump at the second-last would probably have put him upsides the other horse.</p>
      <p>"He will either go to Sandown for the Henry VIII, if the ground is OK, or wait for the Wayward Lad the day after Boxing Day."</p>
