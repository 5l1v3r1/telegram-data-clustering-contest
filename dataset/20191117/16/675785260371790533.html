      <h3>What you can  do</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Be given a free can of coke</b>
      </p>
      <p>Visitors will be able to visit a winter wonderland setting and enjoy a 150ml can of Coca-Cola zero sugar, Diet Coke or Coca-Cola.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You can buy personalised glass bottles</b>
      </p>
      <p>People who visit the truck can buy a pack of 250ml glass bottles of Coca-Cola personalised with your name on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Grab a photo with the truck</b>
      </p>
      <p>You can either get a photo at three locations alongside the truck, namely 'The Photo Podium, 'The Photo Frame' and 'The Selfie Bridge'.</p>
      <p>You can also take a photo in front of the truck.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ask someone to take a photo for you</b>
      </p>
      <p>Staff at the festive truck are on hand to take photos of yourself and friends and family.</p>

        <figcaption>Families have been flocking to the Coca-Cola Christmas truck 'winter wonderland'</figcaption>

      <h3>What you  can't  do</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Sit inside the cab</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately visitors are not permitted to sit inside the truck's cab and have their photo taken here.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Walk inside the truck</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you expect to see Father Christmas or some reindeers inside - tough luck.</p>
      <p>The back of the truck is full of cans of Coca-Cola and props and is only accessible to Coca-Cola staff.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Skip the line</b>
      </p>
      <p>Visitors who want to have a free drink and photo with the truck will have to queue up. The queues will get longer when children and parents come out of school and work respectively, so be aware.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stand in the way of cars</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is common sense but visitors should be mindful of cars in the car park.</p>
      <p>Barriers will be placed in order to zig zag the queues and avoid queues spilling out in the car park.</p>
