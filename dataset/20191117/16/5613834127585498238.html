      <h1>The Cast of ‘The Last of Us’ to Reunite for a Definitive Playthrough Series</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:09:01+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/harrison-abbott/" target="_blank">Harrison Abbott</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3590683/last-us-part-ii-delayed-may-29/">It was recently announced</a> that <b><i>The Last of Us Part II</i></b> has been delayed so that it can be polished to a satisfactory ‘’Naughty Dog quality’’.  With a new release date of May 2020, this means that we are going to have to be a little patient before we can experience the continuation of Joel and Ellie’s story. However, it turns out that we won’t need to wait <i>that</i> long before we can see the cast together on-screen again, as there will be a little something to tide us over in the interim. </p>
      <p>Indeed, the gang will soon be reforming for a ‘’definitive’’ playthrough of the original game, as promised by star Troy Baker <a href="https://twitter.com/TroyBakerVA/status/1195751866094641152">on Twitter</a>. The multi-part series will commence on Tuesday, when it will feature on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx42AsHSKnjEfPXk0YiGCyw"><b><i>Retro Replay</i></b> YouTube channel.</a> </p>
      <p>For those not familiar with <i>Retro Replay</i>, it’s a weekly show in which Baker and fellow voice-actor/ mo-cap performer Nolan North hang out and play through classic video games, such as <b><i>Twisted Metal, Pitfall, </i></b>and <b><i>Rampage</i></b>. Ever since they debuted back in May 2018, the pair have been embraced by fans for their chemistry, with a typical episode seeing them share anecdotes, doing impressions, providing entertaining commentary and making obscure pop-cultural references. Oh, and also dying. A lot. </p>
      <p>Lately, they’ve branched off into covering more contemporary titles and in particular, they have been working their way through the back catalog of Naughty Dog, a company with which they obviously both have a storied history. Having already done a full playthrough of <b><i>Uncharted: Darke’s Fortune</i></b>, as well as snippets of <b><i>Crash Bandicoot</i></b> and <b><i>Uncharted: Among Thieves</i></b><i>,</i> it was only a matter of time before they got around to <b><i>The Last of Us</i></b>. </p>
      <p>In the video announcement, Baker says: ‘” The controller is now in my hands. We are going to begin the journey and go through the definitive playthrough of <i>The Last of Us. </i>And I won’t be alone. Not only will [Nolan] be joining me […] but we will have special guests. And I can’t imagine doing it with anybody else but the cast of <i>The Last of Us</i>’’ </p>
      <p>Right now, it’s unclear exactly who that final part is referring to, but if it’s anything like the <i>Uncharted</i> series, then chances are guests will dip in-and-out between episodes. Hopefully, we’ll get to see Ellie herself, Ashley Johnson, join them on the couch at least once. Either way it should be fun and will certainly help make the wait for <i>Part II</i> slightly less agonising. </p>
