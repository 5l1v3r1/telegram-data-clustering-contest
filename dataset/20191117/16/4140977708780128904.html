          <p>Sitting atop of Group H ahead of today’s culminating encounter, for France the road to next year’s Euro 202 has been quite the smooth ride numbers tell. The side might be in first place but their wins have been far from convincing with the team needing to scrape through some tedious encounters to make it this far.</p>
          <p>And despite currently reigning supreme in their group with the seven wins from nine matches which see them the two points above second placed Turkey, the French will be far from happy with the brand of football they have doled out. It’s one completely unbecoming of a team who are the current world cup holders, a drab set of results which was emphasises in their most recent outing Moldova who they just about managed to scram by 2-1.</p>

                <p>However, all things said and done, what matters at the end of the day is the position which the side occupy, one they’ll be looking to make their own come today. With Turkey faltering in their recent set of fixtures, losing the one match to allow France to displace them and move into first place, the French know even a draw will suffice today to see them continue to occupy top place at the ed of the qualifiers.</p>
                <p>Elsewhere for Kosovo, things have been bleak, tepid and remorse filled with the side’s recklessness ending up being their demise. With just the four wins from nine matches, their drab showings mean ther qualification journey has come to an end but having drawn with Andorra 2-2 in their last outing, the side will be looking to dole out something similar and bring an end to a sorry journey with a resounding result.</p>

                            <h3>ALB Vs FRA Dream11 Goal-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>They let in two goals against fifth placed Andorra, shedding light on just how appalling and abject their defence has being. The peril is set to continue for them today as well when France come calling, a side against whom they are bound to be refrained from keeping a cleansheet.</p>
                            <p>Despite that, we are still brining in the side’s goal-keeper, Etrit Berisha for this one given the saves he’s likely to engross us in and keep the points flowing at a steady rate.</p>
                            <h3>ALB Vs FRA Dream11 Defenders</h3>
                            <p>France have shipped goals in ther foregone fixtures, going to sleep in defence to lose cohesion and shape but the side are way the likelier unit when it comes to the two units of completing in place a shut down. It sees us make this docket all about them with both the CBs, Raphael Varane and Presnel Kimpembe being our choice for the day alongside fullback Leo Dubois who is set to persistently canter his way into the opposition’s side of the park.</p>
                            <p>Albania will have the one player come in as well for us with us opting for Elseid Hysaj given his goal scoring persuasion.</p>
                            <h3>ALB Vs FRA Dream11 Midfielders</h3>
                            <p>The lightest docket of our Dream 11 side, we have kept things down to the bare minimum requisite of three players with us opting for Thomas Lemar as the lone selection from France. From the other side meanwhile we have Ledian Memushaj and Keidi Bare represent us, a seamless partnership of attack and defence with the both being tasked with holding fort for their side while at the same time transitioning the ball from defence to attack as well.</p>
                            <h3>ALB Vs FRA Dream11 Strikers</h3>
                            <p>One of the most integral components of this French side, Olivier Giroud has shown why he’s held in such reverence by his countrymen. The player scored a penalty in the previous match, adding to the pile of crucial goals for his country and given the immense stature accorded to him in the side, he’s set to play in this one as well. </p>
                            <p>Kylian Mbappe has been scoring goals at will as well recently to see him come in as the second player with Antoine Griezmann wrapping up our facet.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Giroud will captain our side out for this one while Mbappe is selected as the vice-captain.</p>
