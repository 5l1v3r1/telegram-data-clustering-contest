      <h1>Cardiff City and Swansea City to battle Middlesbrough, Bristol City and Derby County for in-form striker - reports</h1>
      <h2>The South Wales rivals are reportedly among six Championship clubs taking a look at the 24-year old</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:51:02+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:51</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Coleman</a></address>
      <p>Cardiff City and Swansea City are among a host of Championship clubs reportedly battling it out for Livingston forward Lyndon Dykes.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/exclusive-derby-one-of-six-championship-clubs-keen-on-livingston-star">Team Talk</a> , the Scottish club could well be open to selling the 6ft 2in forward, who despite signing last January only made his debut for the club this season.</p>
      <p>Dykes has been in impressive form in this campaign, netting five goals and notching up two assists in 14 games, and his form is believed to have caught the eye of admirers elsewhere.</p>
      <p>And, it's claimed Livingston could well decide to cash in when the transfer window re-opens in January.</p>
      <p>The two South Wales rivals are among six Championship clubs believed to be keen on making a move, with Middlesbrough, Bristol City, Derby and Blackburn also credited with an interest.</p>
      <p>It's not yet clear how much it would take to prise the Australian-born man away from the Scottish Premiership outfit.</p>
      <p>The news comes after Cardiff were linked with making a move for young Ayr United striker <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/who-luke-mccowan-everything-you-17221419">Luke McCowan</a> , although Bluebirds boss Neil Warnock played down any links with the 21-year old shortly before his departure from the club on Monday.</p>
