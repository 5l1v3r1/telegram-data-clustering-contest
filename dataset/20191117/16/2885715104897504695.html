      <p>Union Minister Giriraj Singh said that he would retire from politics when the legislation “to control population” will be enacted in the country.</p>
      <p>Singh, who is a minister of animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries in the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/narendra-modi">Narendra Modi</a>-led government, also said that two of his long-cherished dreams — scrapping Kashmir’s special provisions and Ram temple construction at Ayodhya — have been recently fulfilled.</p>
      <p>“It’s time I take retirement from politics as two of my wishes have been fulfilled. I will make an exit the day a bill is enacted to control population,” Singh was quoted as saying by news agency PTI on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Singh for long had been <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/no-voting-rights-for-couples-with-more-than-2-kids-giriraj-singh-on-world-population-day-5825611/">pitching for a strong legislation to control the population growth in the country</a>. The <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> MP, at a Delhi seminar in September, had also likened India’s growing population to “second-stage cancer”.</p>
      <p>“In India, population explosion is disturbing the balance of economy, social harmony and resources. One of the reasons (for failure to check it) is <i>dhaarmik vyavadhan</i> (religious obstacles),” Singh once wrote in a tweet.</p>
      <p>Claiming that there would soon be a need for birth control law to be formulated, the Cabinet minister had warned saying, “India appears to be heading like in 1947 towards another a ‘<i>saanskritik vibhajan</i>’ (partition in the name of culture). All political parties will have to come forward for a birth control law.”</p>
      <p>He had also earlier thanked the Assam government for barring couples with more than two children from applying for government jobs.</p>
      <p>Singh also got involved in a war of words with Badruddin Ajmal, a Lok Sabha member and president of the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), who said that the government’s policy will not stop Muslims from making babies. Singh responded saying: “Is Islam a factory to produce children?”</p>
