        <b>2021 Africa Cup of Nations Qualifier</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> South Africa 1-0 Sudan</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 17 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Orlando Stadium</p>
      <p>Bafana Bafana got their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign up and running with victory over Group C leaders Sudan at Orlando Stadium on Sunday afternoon.</p>

      </p>
      <p>South Africa head coach Molefi Ntseki rang the changes following the defeat to Ghana as Erick Mathoho, Lebogang Mothiba, Lebogang Phiri and Thulani Serero earned starts, while Sudan were unchanged from their win over Sao Tome and Principe.</p>
      <p>The South Africans dominated from the onset and could have found themselves three goals ahead in the opening 15 minutes after Mothiba squandered a couple golden chances in the box, while Thapelo Morena also failed to convert a golden chance early on.</p>
      <p>Sudan, who bagged four goals earlier this week, were surprisingly quite content with sitting and soaking up all the pressure although they were unable to provide any threat on the counter.</p>
      <p>Despite the lack of goals for the home side, the link up play between Percy Tau, Serero and Phiri were encouraging signs for Ntseki as the visitors had no answer for the European-based trio.</p>
      <p>It was a European-based player who got the opening goal as Phiri smashed the ball into the top corner on the stroke of halftime after reacting quickest to a loose ball in the box.</p>
      <p>The second half continued in similar fashion to the first, although the marauding runs of Morena down the right flank were a constant source of attack.</p>
      <p>Ntseki was forced into his first change after 68 minutes as Phiri was replaced by Lebohang Manyama after picking up a knock, while Mothiba made way for Kermit Erasmus two minutes later.</p>
      <p>The Cape Town City men nearly sealed the points for Bafana with 13 minutes remaining after skipping past one Sudanese defender before unleashing a low strike that was brilliantly kept out by Sudan goalkeeper Ali Aboeshren.</p>
      <p>The hosts did push for more goals in the latter stages of the half, but 1-0 was how the encounter finished as Bafana remain in third place in Group C.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's how they lined up:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>South Africa:</b> Williams, Morena, Hlanti, Mathoho, Hlatshwayo (C), Mokotjo, Furman, Phiri, Tau, Serero, Mothiba.</p>
      <p><b>Subs:</b> Keet (GK), Goss (GK), Lebusa, Mkhwanazi, Lorch , Manyama, Mvala, Modiba, Maela, Grobler, Mokeke, Erasmus.</p>
      <p><b>Sudan:</b> Aboeshren, Atahir Mohamed, Suliman, Ismaeil, Mahamoud Ahmed, Mahamoud, Shareif, Abdelrahman, Hamid.</p>
