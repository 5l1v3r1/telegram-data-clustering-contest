        <b>The percentage of workers receiving minimum wages declined by 1.1 percentage points to 21.3 percent in the first nine months of the year compared to the same period in 2018.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“The most recent data show that the proportion of workers with compensation equal to RMMG [Minimum Guaranteed Monthly Remuneration] decreased from 22.4 percent in the first nine months of 2018 to 21.3 percent in the same period of 2019 (1.1 pp) despite the increase in the value of RMMG to 600 Euros,” reads the document from the Ministry of Labour, Solidarity and Social Security.</p>
      <p>According to the same source, the weight of the minimum wage in the payroll decreased by 0.5 percentage points (pp) until September 2019 over the same period last year to 10.4 percent.</p>
      <p>The document presented to the partners and distributed to the press in the meantime is not yet part of the Government's proposal to increase the minimum wage next year, and the topic will be discussed this morning at the Social Concertation, with the executive setting a target of 750 Euros in 2023.</p>
      <p>The Ministry emphasizes in the document that the forecast inflation rate is 1.3 percent for 2019 and 1.4 percent for 2020 and that the economy should grow 1.9 percent in the two years, as well as productivity.</p>
      <p>The Government underlines that the discussion on the evolution of the minimum wage for 2020 takes place with the social partners “without prejudice to a broader dialogue on social policy on medium-term wage and income that should be initiated in the short term”.</p>
      <p>In the document, the Ministry stated that at the meeting it will hear from the social partners on “readiness to start discussion and work towards a global wage and income policy agreement”.</p>
      <p>The number of workers receiving the national minimum wage was 755,900 in April, according to previous government data.</p>
