      <p>ATHENS (Reuters) - Thousands of Greeks, including former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, marched through central Athens on Sunday evening to mark the anniversary of a violently quashed student uprising in 1973 that helped topple a military junta.</p>
      <p>The annual march often becomes a focal point for protests against government policies and in recent years against austerity, after a decade-long debt crisis.</p>
      <p>Police deployed more than 5,000 officers in central Athens. A helicopter hovered over the central Syntagma Square and neighboring districts through the day.</p>
      <p>At the front of the procession, due to end at the U.S. embassy, youths held a blood-stained flag that belonged to the students engaged in the 1973 revolt. Protesters resent Washington for its support of the 1967-1974 military dictatorship.</p>
      <p>Tsipras, a leftist who lost parliamentary elections to his conservative rival Kyriakos Mitsotakis in July, took part. Dressed in a leather jacket and jeans Tspiras hooked arms with other officials from the Syriza movement during the procession.</p>
      <p>Since Friday, many people have laid wreaths and carnations at the Athens Polytechnic, site of a bloody clampdown on Nov. 17 1973 when tanks smashed through the gates to crush a revolt that heralded the end of the junta.</p>
      <p>On Monday, police clashed with students protesting against the shutdown of a prominent Athens university, the University of Economics and Business. Authorities had raided the university to confiscate materials they said were typically used in violent demonstrations.</p>
      <p>It was the first time police and protesters had clashed inside university premises since the conservative governmentâ€™s abolition of academic sanctuary in August.</p>
      <p>The sanctuary law, a legacy of the 1973 crackdown on students, left a deep-rooted suspicion toward authority among Greeks.</p>
