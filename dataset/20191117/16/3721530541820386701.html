      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/franchise/power-rangers/702"><i>Power Rangers</i></a><i>: Legacy Wars </i>is a 2017 mobile game for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/apple">iOS</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/android">Android</a> devices, and even if you’re not interested in a fighting game on a phone, its recent crossover with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/franchise/street-fighter/3080">Street Fighter</a> is a little intriguing, because Chun-Li is in a Power Rangers getup.</p>
      <p>Chun-Li herself has been in the game since May 2018 (with colleagues Ryu, Guile, Akuma, Cammy, and M. Bison) but this is an alternate look cooked up by nWay Games. As Chun-Li Ranger, she can set her foe alight with blue Phoenix fire using the Volcano Kick, Phoenix Dance and her super, the Thousand Phoenix Kicks.</p>
      <p>Fans (in the YouTube comments, anyway) are hoping this spells an appearance for Chun-Li Ranger in <i>Power Rangers: Battle for the </i><i>Grid</i>, which <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/18/18188207/power-rangers-battle-for-the-grid-switch-ps4-xbox-one-pc">launched on consoles</a> this spring and will be a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/6/18655087/google-stadia-games-list-destiny-2-baldurs-gate-3">launch title for Google Stadia</a> when that arrives. Our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/6/18531160/power-rangers-battle-for-the-grid-balance-broken">detailed analysis of the game, back in May</a>, found it to be very unbalanced but still, strangely, fun as a “broken” game for all of the outrage it causes in players who get their asses kicked.</p>
