      <h1>MCU Phase 5 news: Marvel set release dates for eight more movies, and one might be ‘Avengers 5’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:59:02+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Smith</a></address>
      <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe is going to have an insanely busy Phase 4, which is the upcoming MCU stage that will contain a massive mix of limited TV series and regular superhero movies. That’s because Marvel and Disney will leverage the new Disney+ streaming service in addition to movie theaters to tell brand new MCU stories. Marvel chief Kevin Feige already said that <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/09/avengers-endgame-secrets-loki-escape-timeline-explained-in-phase-4/">you’ll need to be aware</a> of what happens in all the MCU series hitting Disney+ to understand the upcoming MCU movies better. At $6.99 a month though, Disney+ is a steal considering <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/16/disney-plus-shows-most-watched-this-week/">all the incredible content</a> it’ll have to offer.</p>
      <p>But we’ll still get awesome MCU films in the coming years. We’re looking at six motion pictures that will hit theaters in 2020 and 2021, <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/10/08/spider-man-3-release-date-fan-theory-explains-mcu-exit-storyline/">including <i>Spider-Man 3</i></a>, and then we’ll also get at least eight films between 2022 and 2023. That’s right, Marvel just set the release dates for five extra MCU Phase 5 titles, on top of the three that we already had. We don’t want to get our hopes up too high just yet, but one of those five new films might be <i>Avengers 5</i>, and another one could even be <i>Deadpool 3</i>.</p>
      <h3>The new dates</h3>
      <p>We initially thought that February 8th, May 6th, and July 29th were the dates of unannounced Phase 4 films that will premiere in 2022. But that doesn’t seem to be the case — since then, Marvel announced one title for those three dates, and that’s the <i>Black Panther 2</i> on <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/08/25/mcu-phase-5-movies-black-panther-2-release-date-unveiled-at-d23-expo/">May 6th, 2022</a>. Per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disney-sets-2021-release-ridley-scotts-last-duel-pushes-back-kings-man-7-months-1255349"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>, Marvel has now set five extra dates for Marvel movies, one in 2022 and four others in 2023. That’s right, we’ll have four MCU films per year starting 2021 thanks to the recent <i>Spider-Man 3</i> addition to Phase 4.</p>
      <p>Here are all the official MCU dates for 2022 and 2023:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>February 8th, 2022</li>
        <li>May 6th, 2022 — <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/08/25/mcu-phase-5-movies-black-panther-2-release-date-unveiled-at-d23-expo/"><i>Black Panther 2</i></a></li>
        <li>July 29th, 2022</li>
        <li>October 7th, 2022</li>
        <li>February 17th, 2023</li>
        <li>May 5th, 2023</li>
        <li>July 28th, 2023</li>
        <li>November 3rd, 2023</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The movies</h3>

      <p>As you can see in the list above, only one title has been confirmed for Phase 5, but Marvel said back at Comic-Con in July that it’s working on several sequels as well as brand new movies. <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/07/21/mcu-phase-4-movie-titles-and-release-dates-comic-con-2019/">Feige &amp; Co. announced</a> that <i>Captain Marvel 2</i>, <i>Guardians 3</i>, <i>Fantastic Four</i> and X-Men projects are all in the works for the near future. That’s on top of the <i>Blade</i> reboot:</p>
      <blockquote>We didn’t even mention that we’re making <i>Black Panther 2</i>. And we didn’t mention that <i>Guardians of the Galaxy 3</i> is coming. We didn’t even have time to talk about <i>Captain Marvel 2</i>, by the way. I didn’t even have time to talk about the <i>Fantastic Four</i>. And there’s no time left to talk about mutants.</blockquote>
      <p>It’s likely that Marvel will mix and match sequels to existing franchises with brand new adventures that will further expand the MCU. We’re waiting for Marvel to introduce the X-Men and unveil the next big villain of the MCU, which are all required elements for <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/14/avengers-endgame-sequel-secret-wars-story-in-development-at-marvel/">creating an <i>Avengers</i> sequel of <i>Endgame</i> proportions</a>.</p>
      <p>Will we have an <i>Avengers 5</i> film in Phase 5? That’s yet to be determined. If we do get one, it might be a story similar to the original <i>Avengers</i> that sets up the new team of heroes.</p>
      <p>Then there’s the Merc with a Mouth, of course.</p>

      <h3>Deadpool 3</h3>

      <p>Ryan Reynolds and friends <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/10/21/deadpool-3-release-date-is-an-announcement-coming-soon/">have been teasing <i>Deadpool 3</i> for a while now</a>, with the actor suggesting that the hero will arrive in the MCU during Phase 5. We already know that Disney wants to keep telling the same R-rated stories that started while Fox made <i>Deadpool</i> movies, but we’ll also finally get the awesome MCU integration we’ve always dreamed of for the superhero.</p>
      <p>We don’t have any confirmed release date for the film at this point, but one insider who has been accurate with his previous MCU leaks thinks he knows when <i>Deadpool 3</i> might launch. “Based on the rumors of a Deadpool 3 being in the works, and the success of the R-rated Joker in an October release date; October 7 2022 might be the release date for the new Deadpool movie,” writes Jeremy Conrad <a href="https://mcucosmic.com/2019/11/15/there-will-be-four-mcu-movies-in-2022-and-four-in-2023/">for <i>MCU Cosmic</i></a>.</p>
      <p><i>Joker</i> turned out to be a massive hit, topping the box office at launch and then hovering around that top spot for several more weeks. The film just passed the $1 billion mark at the worldwide box office, making it the most successful R-rated movie of all time.</p>
      <p>Marvel won’t announce the full Phase 5 roster until sometime in 2021, so we still have a long wait ahead of us.</p>
