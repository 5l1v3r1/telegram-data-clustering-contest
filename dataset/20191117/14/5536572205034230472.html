      <p>LFA 78 took place Friday night at Bell County Expo Center in Belton, Texas and it brought possibly one of the most devastating elbow knockouts ever seen.</p>
      <p>In the co-main event of the evening, Jose Johnson squared off against Rafael Costa.</p>
      <p>Johnson was simply trying to defend a single leg take-down when he got surprised with an elbow that turned his lights out.</p>
      <p>That elbow left his body twitching on the canvas.</p>
