      <p>COLOMBO: Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who spearheaded the brutal crushing of the Tamil Tigers 10 years ago, stormed to victory on Sunday (Nov 17) in Sri Lanka's presidential elections.</p>
      <p>Rajapaksa conducted a nationalist campaign with a promise of security and a vow to crush religious extremism in the Buddhist-majority country following the Apr 21 suicide bombings blamed on a homegrown jihadi group.</p>

      <p>His triumph will, however, alarm Sri Lanka's Tamil and Muslim minorities as well as activists, journalists and possibly some in the international community following the 2005-15 presidency of his older brother Mahinda Rajapaksa.</p>

      <p>Mahinda, with Gotabaya effectively running the security forces, ended a 37-year civil war with Tamil separatists. His decade in power was also marked by alleged rights abuses, murky extra-judicial killings and closer ties with China.</p>
      <p>Gotabaya, a retired lieutenant-colonel, 70, nicknamed the "Terminator" by his own family, romped to victory with 52.25 per cent of the vote, according to final official results announced by the election commission.</p>
      <p>"I didn't sleep all night," said student Devni, 22, one of around 30 people who gathered outside Rajapaksa's Colombo residence. "I am so excited, he is the president we need."</p>
      <p>Rajapaksa's main rival among a record 35 candidates, the moderate Sajith Premadasa of the ruling party, trailed on 41.99 per cent, and the 52-year-old conceded the race and congratulated Rajapaksa.</p>
      <p>Rajapaksa due to be sworn in on Monday. Turnout was 83.7 per cent.</p>
      <p>Premadasa had strong support in minority Tamil areas but a poor showing in Sri Lanka's Sinhalese heartland, a core support base where Rajapaksa won some two-thirds of the vote.</p>
      <p>
        <b>INTELLIGENCE FAILURE </b>
      </p>
      <p>Saturday's poll was the first popularity test of the United National Party (UNP) government of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.</p>
      <p>Wickremesinghe's administration failed to prevent the April attacks despite prior and detailed intelligence warnings from India, according to a parliamentary investigation.</p>
      <p>On Sunday three cabinet members resigned - including Finance Minister Mangalar Samaraweera.</p>
      <p>Premadasa also offered better security and a pledge to make a former war general, Sarath Fonseka, his national security chief, projecting himself as a victim seeking to crush terrorism.</p>
      <p>He is the son of assassinated ex-president Ranasinghe Premadasa who fell victim to a Tamil rebel suicide bomber in May 1993.</p>

      <p>But Gotabaya is adored by the Sinhalese majority and the powerful Buddhist clergy for how he and Mahinda ended the war in 2009, when 40,000 Tamil civilians allegedly perished at the hands of the army.</p>
      <p>Under his brother, Gotabaya was defence secretary and effectively ran the security forces, allegedly overseeing "death squads" that bumped off rivals, journalists and others. He denies the allegations.</p>
      <p>This makes the brothers detested and feared among many Tamils, who make up 15 per cent of the population. Some in the Muslim community, who make up 10 per cent, are also fearful of Gotabaya, having faced days of mob violence in the wake of the April attacks.</p>
      <p>Under Mahinda, Sri Lanka also borrowed heavily from China for infrastructure projects and even allowed two Chinese submarines to dock in Colombo in 2014, alarming Western countries as well as India.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on Sunday that India looked forward to "deepening the close and fraternal ties ... and for peace, prosperity as well as security in our region".</p>
      <p>The projects ballooned Sri Lanka's debts and many turned into white elephants - such as an airport in the south devoid of airlines - mired in corruption allegations.</p>
      <p>Unlike in 2015 when there were bomb attacks and shootings, this election was relatively peaceful by the standards of Sri Lanka's fiery politics.</p>
      <p>The only major incident was on Saturday when gunmen fired at two vehicles in a convoy of at least 100 buses taking Muslim voters to cast ballots. Two people were injured.</p>
      <p>According to the Election Commission the contest was, however, the worst ever for hate speech and misinformation.</p>
