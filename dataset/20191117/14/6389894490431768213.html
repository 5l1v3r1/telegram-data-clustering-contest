      </p>
      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the manifesto was agreed upon unanimously and he was “very, very proud” of the “transformative document” as he was leaving the meeting last night.</p>
      <p>The manifesto reportedly includes banning people from working more than 48 hours a week, A Right to Food Act to control prices, an extension of the sugar tax and a tax on oil companies, according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7693563/The-Marxist-Manifesto-Jeremy-Corbyn-gathers-closest-hard-Left-allies.html">Mail on Sunday</a>.</p>
      <p>Labour insiders have also confirmed the party’s plans to nationalise water and energy utilities, the railways, Royal Mail and BT.</p>
      <p>When party chairman Ian Lavery was asked by the the Mail on Sunday if the manifesto was more radical than from the 2017 election, he confirmed that it was.</p>
      <p>“We sorted out all the problems and it was fantastic,” he said.</p>
      <p>“This is the best manifesto you are likely to see.”</p>
      <p>Conservative international trade secretary Liz Truss branded it as a “Marxist manifesto” that would “plunge this country into extortionate debt and deliver division and delay”.</p>
      <p>Senior Labour policy advisor Andrew Fisher wrote the manifesto, just months after saying he “no longer had faith” the party could succeed.</p>
      <p>Fisher was dismayed at the “lack of professionalism, competence and human decency” from those in Corbyn’s team.</p>
      <p>Other manifesto policies already announced include free dental checks for everybody in the UK, a second Brexit referendum and a £40bn increase in health spending over five years.</p>
      <p>One point of contention among Labour figures is the party’s position on ending freedom of movement in its negotiated Brexit deal.</p>

      <p>Unite the Union boss Len McCluskey recently said Labour needed to end freedom of movement within the EU.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, other major party figures, such as Momentum’s Jon Lansman, have said the opposite.</p>
