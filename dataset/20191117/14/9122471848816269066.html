      <h1>ESPN’s Paul Finebaum Releases His New Top 6</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:57:02+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>ESPN college football analyst Paul Finebaum has updated his top six poll following Week 12 of the 2019 college football regular season.</p>
      <p>Week 12 saw a couple of undefeated teams go down, with Minnesota losing at Iowa and Baylor blowing a huge lead to Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>Georgia also notched a big-time win, staying in the College Football Playoff race with a win against Auburn.</p>
      <p>Finebaum has since updated his top six:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>LSU</li>
        <li>Ohio State</li>
        <li>Clemson</li>
        <li>Georgia</li>
        <li>Oregon</li>
        <li>Alabama</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The first three spots aren’t really debatable at this point. LSU, Ohio State and Clemson are clearly the country’s top three teams.</p>
      <p>After that, it gets interesting. Georgia is probably deserving of the No. 4 spot right now based on the Bulldogs’ wins (Notre Dame, Florida, Auburn). However, Kirby Smart’s team will probably have to win the SEC Championship Game to hold onto a top four spot.</p>
      <p>The new College Football Playoff rankings will be released on Tuesday night.</p>
