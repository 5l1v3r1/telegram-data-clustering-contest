      <p>The regeneration work at the town's Moot Hall, where the museum is housed, has taken a number of months to complete with the building having to close while work was carried out.</p>
      <p>A formal opening event was held on Saturday with Aldeburgh mayor Sara Fox cutting the ribbon at the venue with the help of mini mayor Evelyn.</p>
      <p>Also on hand to visit the newly re-opened museum was Sue Beardsmore, the chairman of the National Lottery Committee for the Midlands and East.</p>
      <p>The National Lottery Heritage Fund gave a £747,500 grant towards the museum's refurbishment.</p>

      <p>Speaking at the event chairman of the museum's Tony Bone thanked the fund for their help with the renovation.</p>
      <p>Plans to refurbish the Hall have been in the works for around four years with the aim of the project always having been to tell the story of Aldeburgh in a new and exciting way while preserving the history of the building.</p>
      <p>The timber-framed, Grade 1 listed building, dates back to Tudor times and is one of the best preserved buildings of its age still remaining.</p>
      <p>The hall is also home to Aldeburgh's town council.</p>
