        <b>Real Madrid will use attacking midfielder Isco as bait in a fresh attempt to sign Paul Pogba from Manchester United, according to a report in Spain.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pogba, currently returning from an injury, continues to be linked with a move away from Old Trafford, having failed to live up to his €105m price tag in the three years since his return to the club.</p>
      <p>The 2018 World Cup winner was linked with Real Madrid over the summer, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/zinedine-zidane-opens-up-on-chance-arrangement-with-paul-pogba"><b>with compatriot Zinedine Zidane keen on linking up with him</b></a>, although nothing came to fruition.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://eldesmarque.com/madrid/real-madrid/noticias/176093-operacion-pogba-80-millones-y-tu-el-plan-bomba-de-zidane-en-el-real-madrid-ed"><i>El Desmarque</i></a> claim that the La Liga giants are still thinking of a future move for Pogba, and have formulated a plan to lower his price tag.</p>
      <p>The report suggests that, even though Pogba’s price has dropped from €180m to €150m, Madrid are not happy with the amount being demanded, and will look to sweeten a deal by offering a player in return.</p>
      <p>Isco is the player they are willing to sacrifice, with his €60m valuation meaning they would not have to exceed a nine-figure sum for Pogba.</p>
      <p>The Spanish playmaker is growing unsettled in the capital, making only two starts in the league this season. With Zidane seeing no place in his plans for the 27-year-old, Los Blancos want to cash in on him before his value drops any further.</p>

      <p>Pogba has not ruled out a return to Juventus instead, though, and Cristiano Ronaldo is said to have given his approval to the potential move. <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/juventus-look-to-tempt-man-utd-with-four-player-exchange-bid-for-pogba"><b>The Serie A giants are themselves plotting a cash-plus-players bid that could see as many as four players head to Old Trafford</b></a>.</p>
