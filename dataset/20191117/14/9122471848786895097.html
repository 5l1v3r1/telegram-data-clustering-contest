      <h1>Michigan Star Reveals What He Told Michigan State’s Players After Win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:19:27+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Michigan got another needed victory on Saturday, as the Wolverines took care of business at home against Michigan State. Jim Harbaugh’s team entered the rivalry game as a sizable favorite, though you never know what could happen when these two teams meet on the field.</p>
      <p>Harbaugh’s team ended up dominating Mark Dantonio’s squad, winning 44-10.</p>
      <p>The Wolverines were an extremely happy group following the game. One Wolverines player had some harsh words for the Spartans, too.</p>
      <p>Michigan star defensive back Josh Metellus said he told Michigan State’s players to get off the field and go home following the game. Metellus said that the Wolverines are a better and classier program.</p>

      <p>That’s one way to handle a rivalry game win.</p>
      <p>Michigan improved to 8-2 with the victory on Saturday. The Wolverines should get to 9-2 with a win against Indiana next weekend. Then, Ohio State comes to town.</p>
