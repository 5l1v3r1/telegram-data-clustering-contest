      <h1>Shane Duffy to captain Ireland in Denmark showdown</h1>
      <h2>This will be the sixth meeting between the teams in two years but the 5-1 World Cup play-off loss is fresh</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:40:18+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:40</time> by <a rel="author">Paul O'Hehir</a></address>
      <p>Shane Duffy will captain Ireland in tomorrow’s big showdown with Denmark as manager Mick McCarthy declared: It’s time we slapped them.</p>
      <p>This will be the sixth meeting between the teams in two years and the memories of that 5-1 World Cup playoff defeat are hard to shift.</p>
      <p>But the other four encounters all finished in draws and McCarthy says there is no better time to put them to the sword.</p>
      <p>A win will guarantee automatic qualification to the Euros next summer but anything less and it is a playoff in March.</p>
      <p>McCarthy said: “There's a big performance in us. I might as well go home if I don't believe (that Ireland can win) and I'm not going home anytime soon.”</p>
      <p>The Danes fancy themselves as a better team and McCarthy does not feel Ireland get the respect from them that they deserve.</p>
      <p>He said today: “Self praise is no praise. People's opinions don't concern me because it's on the day.</p>
      <p>“I've seen teams who've had everything in their favour and they get slapped, that's what I hope happens tomorrow</p>
      <p>“The only surprise to everybody will be if we win, so yes, I do believe we can surprise them.</p>
      <p>“But it wouldn't be a surprise to me, not at all. I always believe we can win the game and the players leave everything on the pitch for me, they give everything they've got.</p>

      <p>“You never want anyone coming off the pitch regretting not running as far or as hard but I would never accuse players of doing that,”</p>
      <p>While fans and players may have fatigue playing Denmark ahead of the sixth meeting in two years, McCarthy said: “This is only my second, don't forget.</p>
      <p>"Age Hareide said he'd had enough of playing against Ireland. That's not the case for me, this is my second game and I thoroughly enjoyed the first game in Copenhagen.</p>
      <p>“Denmark shaded it for most of the game but towards the end we could have won it. I'm looking forward to it and I'm not cheesed off by playing Denmark, not at all.</p>
      <p>Shane Duffy will captain the team in Seamus Coleman’s absence through suspension having been sent off on a second yellow card in Switzerland last month.</p>
      <p>But Coleman has arrived in to camp to support the team from behind the scenes and even took a part in training today.</p>
      <p>But McCarthy insists it was the logical choice to turn to the big Brighton defender as stand-in skipper who has become a key man for Ireland.</p>

      <p>“He’s a top, top defender and he's got that ability to get a goal. He's good in both boxes.</p>
      <p>“It would be nice if we got goals from elsewhere as well but if its' a free kick or a corner (that’s fine).</p>
      <p>“He's one of them in the squad that everybody looks up to. He gets respect out of people and his team-mates.</p>
      <p>“Without going around screaming and shouting, if we're having a tough time, he rallies the troops and gets them defending.</p>
      <p>“He blocks things and get his head on stuff, he's one of those lads you can rely on.2</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, McCarthy said he invited Richard Keogh to join the squad in a supporting role as he wanted to show him “a bit of love”.</p>
      <p>The defender, 33, was sacked by Derby County two weeks ago for his part in a drink-fuelled car smash that left him with a gruesome knee injury.</p>
      <p>Out for a year, Keogh, a back-seat passenger when the incident happened on a Derby team bonding night  in September, is fighting the club’s decision to boot him out.</p>
      <p>McCarthy said today: “I invited him in to show a bit of love from the rest of the lads. It's not a motivational tool.</p>
      <p>“In the games he's played, he's been brilliant. he's such a great guy and a good character to be around and he's enjoyed the fact that he's been around the lads.”</p>
