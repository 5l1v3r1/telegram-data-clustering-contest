      <p>"Woke up at 3am with a severe and a sharp pain in my abdomen. Knew something wasn't right. Turned out it was appendicitis and had surgery to remove my appendix straight away. This is me immediately after, still a little(a lot) medicated, giving @hayley.erbert a (sexy) little dance. Me: Is this doing it for you babe? Hayley: So hot. Thank you for lying to me babe ;)" the 34-year-old <i>Dancing with the Stars</i> alum <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B48VOjQg-le/?igshid=oe2m9s2hwq6p">captioned</a> a brief video on Instagram.</p>
