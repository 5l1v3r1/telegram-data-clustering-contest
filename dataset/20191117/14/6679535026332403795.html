      <h2>They say November 15 should be earmarked for it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:18:26+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Special-Correspondent-MYSURU-119974/" target="_blank">Special Correspondent MYSURU</a></address>
      <p>Tribal communities of Hunsur have urged the government to celebrate Birsa Munda Jayanti on the lines of similar events held to commemorate various personalities.</p>
      <p>A resolution was passed by various tribal NGOs at Hunsur after observing the 144th birth anniversary of Birsa Munda, who was a tribal leader and who died fighting against the British in present Jharkhand, which urged the government to recognise his contribution to the freedom struggle.</p>
      <p>The NGOs representing the tribal communities said that November 15 should be earmarked for the celebrations to create greater awareness about Birsa Munda among the public.</p>
      <p>It was also resolved to demand a Birsa Munda Bhavan in H.D. Kote, Hunsur, Periyapatana, and Sarguru where the tribal population was significant.</p>
      <p>The attention of the government was drawn to a few other long-pending demands of the tribal people of Hunsur, Veeranahosahalli and, surrounding areas who expressed dismay that they have been ignored.</p>
      <p>S. Sreekanth of Development Through Education said tribals are perturbed by the delay in vetting the pending applications of forest dwellers who were denied the benefits of the Forest Rights Act.</p>
      <p>Hence they urged the government to expedite the process of receiving applications and vetting the same to grant forest rights for the community members.</p>
      <p>The Panchayat Development Officers came under flak for their alleged casual manner in which the proceedings are conducted. They were urged to submit the applications to the higher authorities to pave way for granting of forest rights.</p>
      <p>To empower the community socio-economically, the tribals sought internal reservation for jobs in government services, and for admission in educational institutions based on their population.</p>
      <p>This would be reiterated and placed before the Justice Nagamohan Das committee which is scheduled to meet on November 25, added Mr. Sreekanth.</p>
