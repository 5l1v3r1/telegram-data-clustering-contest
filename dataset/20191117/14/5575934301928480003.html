      <ul>
        <li>Wendy’s is rolling out a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/wendys-new-breakfast-menu-is-rolling-out-nationwide-review-2019-9">new breakfast menu</a> in January.</li>
        <li>Wendy’s has never had luck with its breakfast menus, and that’s somewhat <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/wendys-learns-from-breakfast-mistakes-boost-sales-2019-10">due to McDonald’s efforts</a> to counter Wendy’s efforts.</li>
        <li>McDonald’s breakfast is a fan favourite, but with the chain <a href="http://www.franchisetimes.com/news/July-2019/McDonalds-Sees-Strong-Results-amid-Market-Share-Street-Fight/">relying heavily</a> on breakfast to win more visitors, it has a lot to lose if Wendy’s snags a significant market share of the breakfast business.</li>
        <li>I compared every single distinct item on both menus in order to see how the two chains’ breakfast offerings stack up. I found that this time around, Wendy’s breakfast menu has some clear-cut advantages over McDonald’s.</li>

      <p>Like the forces of good and evil, fire and ice, and people who put the toilet paper roll backward and people who put it on the right way, McDonald’s and Wendy’s are forever at odds with each other.</p>
      <p>McDonald’s has long been the emperor of breakfast, but Wendy’s is looking to conquer some of the Golden Arches’ buttery territory. The pig-tailed would-be usurper is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/wendys-breakfast-menu-launching-nationally-coffee-frosty-2019-9">rolling out</a> a breakfast menu nationwide in January 2020.</p>
      <p>The last time Wendy’s tried to sell breakfast, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/wendys-learns-from-breakfast-mistakes-boost-sales-2019-10">McDonald’s did it’s best</a> to make sure it was never a real threat. But things have changed: Wendy’s new breakfast menu is simpler and cheaper to make, and it will <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/wendys-learns-from-breakfast-mistakes-boost-sales-2019-10">come in full force</a> when it rides over the hill in January.</p>
      <p>As these two fast-food titans sharpen their swords for January’s reckoning, we decided to pit their breakfast babies against each other in a cheesy, eggy, bacon-y battle.</p>
      <p>So here you are: McDonald’s and Wendy’s entire breakfast menus, compared. I left out items I felt were redundant, like plain biscuits or sandwiches with just egg. I also left out items that weren’t exclusive to breakfast, such as McDonald’s yogurt parfait.</p>

      <h3>McDonald’s has McMuffins, McGriddles, biscuits, and bagel sandwiches. It also sells hotcakes, a homestyle breakfast, a breakfast burrito, and McCafe beverages.</h3>

      <h3>MCDONALD’S — ICED COFFEE, $US2.69 — McDonald’s iced coffee comes with milk and sugar. It’s pleasant and drinkable, but the coffee flavour is underwhelming.</h3>

      <h3>MCDONALD’S — STRAWBERRY BANANA SMOOTHIE, $US3.69 — Unfortunately, the strawberry banana smoothie is just as sweet but no more fruity. All the flavour in this “smoothie” tasted very artificial.</h3>

      <h3>MCDONALD’S — MCCHICKEN BISCUIT, $US3.19 — If you’ve ever wondered, “what would a McChicken patty taste like in a biscuit,” this sandwich was made for you. It’s literally a McChicken patty in a biscuit.</h3>
