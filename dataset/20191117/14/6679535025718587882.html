      <p>Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president and Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy has termed highly objectionable the affidavit filed by Principal Secretary (Transport) Sunil Sharma in the High Court on the ongoing strike by the TSRTC staff wherein he alleged that the RTC unions have colluded with opposition parties to topple the State government.</p>
      <p>At a press conference at Gandhi Bhavan on Sunday, Mr. Reddy said the allegations in the affidavit were serious in nature. “If his allegations are true, then all Opposition leaders should be arrested and jailed. If he is wrong, then he must be immediately dismissed from service for furnishing false information to the court,” he demanded.</p>
      <p>The PCC chief charged that the TRS Government has resorted to falsehood by submitting wrong and misleading information before the HC on RTC issue multiple times. He pointed out that the court has remarked that it had never seen such officials lying so much before the court. He said the recent allegations by a senior IAS officer have put the credibility of the High Court at stake and the Chief Justice must order a probe to know the truth.</p>
      <p>He urged the Chief Justice to take cognizance of the matter and order a CBI or independent probe into the allegations levelled by IAS officer to unravel the truth. He said that the High Court must also inquire at whose instance the IAS officer has levelled such serious allegations. He said that the Congress party would raise the issue in Parliament and also take up the issue with the Department of Personnel and Training.</p>
      <p>Accusing Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of taking unilateral decisions, the TPCC chief demanded that State government convene an all-party meeting to discuss the issue.</p>
      <p>He announced that the Congress would support the ‘Sadak Bandh’ agitation on November 19 and the party would extend all cooperation till the RTC workers get justice.</p>
