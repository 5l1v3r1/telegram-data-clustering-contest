      <p>JOHNSON CITY (WBNG) – The Crossfit Sona gym in Johnson City had extra motivation to workout on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The gym honored 15-year-old Maddie Shaw with a Hero Workout of the Day, or WOD. Shaw passed away on Sunday, November 10, 2019 after a six-year fight with Ewing’s Sarcoma cancer.</p>
      <p>To co-owner Traci Meier, this way just one way she and the crossfit community could commemorate Shaw’s impact on their lives.</p>
      <p>“It’s the crossfit community’s way of honoring those who have fought the good fight,” Meier said. “There are hundreds of hero WODs out there. and Maddie is now one of them. It was an honor to do this for her.”</p>
      <p>The 30-minute workout consisted of various activities, all relating to powerful numbers in Shaw’s life.</p>

      <p>The number ‘9’ signifying the age Shaw was when she was diagnosed.</p>
      <p>The number ‘6’ was for the years Shaw fought cancer.</p>
      <p>The number ’15’ for the age when Shaw tragically passed away.</p>
      <p>“I think when you make a workout after Maddie there has to be some type of significance for it, and that’s what we decided on,” Meier said.</p>
      <p>Meier estimates around 45 people showed to participate. To Kat Hores, a member of ‘Team Maddie’ for the last 6 years, Shaw’s presence was felt in the gym.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think it’s ‘If Maddie was here today.’ I do believe that Maddie was here today,” Hores said. “She smiles upon all of us, she helps us through everything, little moments, and I think you can honestly feel her around you and your surroundings.”</p>
      <p>So as the workout clock hit zero, the joy of finishing the workout quickly turned to moments of reflection and remembrance.</p>
      <p>“Keep fighting, keep pushing forward and doing what you have to do because we’re still going every single day,” Hores said.</p>
      <p>Meier echoing a similar sentiment.</p>
      <p>“Don’t give up, and if you need to look to someone for strength and courage, look at Maddie’s story,” Meier said.</p>
      <p>Participants could also donate money while in attendance. The donations go to Alex’s Lemonade Stand, a pediatric cancer charity.</p>
      <p>Below is a list of members of the 2014 ‘Mission for Maddie’ fundraiser were attendance, including Hores and Meier:</p>
      <p>Grace Tabeek<br/>Kelly Hoyt<br/>Cindy Papaleo<br/>Lisa Mallery<br/>Renee Gincerowski<br/>Kathy washa<br/>Elaine Errifo-Gilyard<br/>Michele Thompson<br/>Kat Hores<br/>Traci Meier</p>
