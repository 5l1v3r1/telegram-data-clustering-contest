        <b>Success Nwogu, Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Peoples Democratic Party on Sunday demanded the immediate cancellation of alleged allocated votes perceived to be in favour of the All Progressives Congress in the Kogi State elections.</p>
      <p>The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement, urged the Independent National Electoral Commission to particularly cancel what he called ‘allocated votes’ for Okene Local Government Area.</p>
      <p>He said, “The party demands the immediate cancellation of such allocated results, particularly in Okene LGA.</p>
      <p>“The people of Kogi State have glaring evidence of alterations of figures to reduce the votes of the PDP and allocate imported figures to the APC.</p>
      <p>“The party, therefore, cautions INEC not to ever declare such mutilated results as they will not be accepted by the people.</p>
      <p>“Our party hopes that this apparent moves to allocate fictitious results to the APC has no bearing with the allegations in the public space that Governor Yahaya Bello and the APC had compromised highly placed INEC officials with huge sums of money to alter the result in favour of the APC.”</p>
      <p>The PDP spokesman cautioned the INEC to note that any attempt to declare the figures allegedly being bandied will be a validation of the bribery allegation.</p>
      <p>According to him, the only way out is for INEC to cancel and drop the fictitious figures being bandied and declare only the results from votes cast and declared at the respective polling units.</p>
