      <h1>'Cows can't stop bushfires': Minister at odds with Nats</h1>

      <p>NSW Environment Minister Matt Kean will not allow cattle to graze in national parks, putting him at odds with the Nationals who want farmers to have access to the fire-prone land.</p>
      <p>The Coalition is again split over bushfire policy, with Agriculture Minister Adam Marshall renewing calls for grazing to be permitted in national parks to help manage fuel loads.</p>
      <p>But Mr Marshall has stopped short of supporting a push from the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party to allow farmers to conduct hazard reduction burning in national parks.</p>

      <p>The Shooters will this week introduce a bill to allow farmers to conduct "small controlled burns" in national parks to safeguard their property.</p>
      <p>Shooters MLC Robert Borsak said national parks had been mismanaged and were a fire risk to farmers who have properties neighbouring public land.</p>
      <p>Mr Kean dismissed the Shooters' proposal, saying: "It if wasn't so dangerous it would be laughable." But he also ruled out Mr Marshall's call to allow stock grazing on public land.</p>
      <p>"The idea that a few cows can stop bushfires is as ridiculous as it sounds," Mr Kean said.</p>
      <p>He said the Shooters' proposal was not just ridiculous but also a risk to lives.</p>
      <p>"Let's think about this for a second - a farmer is just going to go into a national park with some matches and start burning areas they think look a bit risky," Mr Kean said.</p>
      <p>"And what, just take a bucket of water with them in case it flares up?"</p>
      <p>The Shooters' bill follows the <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53b0t.html">NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) conceding last week that farmers in bushfire-ravaged parts of the state may have been doing their own back-burning</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr Marshall said he wanted national parks to be "the best neighbour a farmer can have".</p>
      <p>"Farmers are required to manage pests, weeds, biosecurity and fuel loads on their own properties. National parks and all public landowners should and must be held to the same standard," he said.</p>
      <p>“I won’t support national parks abrogating its responsibilities in any of these areas to neighbouring farmers. That’s cost-shifting and it’s not right.”</p>
      <p>Mr Marshall said the government needed to look at "a variety of ways to reduce fuel loads in national parks and all public land".</p>
      <p>"That should include permitting stock grazing in areas where appropriate," Mr Marshall said.</p>
      <p>Deputy Premier and Nationals leader John Barilaro <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53ada.html">weighed into the debate over fire management last week</a>, calling for more hazard reduction in national parks.</p>
      <p>Mr Barilaro said not enough hazard-reduction burning had been done in national parks to manage the fuel load.</p>
      <p>Mr Borsak said he would introduce his bill this week because it was "outrageous" that the government was not prepared to give farmers "even a small lifeline".</p>
      <p>"The comments from some of the ministers that this would be about giving farmers a box of matches is just outrageous and completely misses the point," he said.</p>
      <p>He said he still intended to give notice of his bill in the upper house on Tuesday. This is the final sitting week of the year before the summer break.</p>
      <p>But Mr Borsak's bill is unlikely to be supported by the government, which says hazard reduction is a complex task that requires significant planning.</p>
