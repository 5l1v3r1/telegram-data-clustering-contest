      <p>A British man had to spend months in hospital and lost the use of his legs after a parasitic worm crawled up his penis.</p>
      <p>James Michael, 32, was travelling around south-eastern Africa with friends when they spent a while on the shores of Lake Malawi.</p>
      <p>The group of four swam and canoed for three hours a day in the freshwater lake, and it’s here that James was exposed to the worm.</p>
      <p>Without him realising, it burrowed its way inside him and laid eggs, which infected him with bilharzia.</p>
      <p>He slowly became so ill that his immune system went into overdrive, and attacked his spine, preventing him from using his legs.</p>
      <p>After a stint in a wheelchair he had to use crutches for four months, as well as suffering digestion and toilet problems.</p>

      <p>Luckily, he has now made a full recovery – but is warning others not to swim where there is a risk of waterborne disease.</p>

      <p>James, from Kensington in London, said: ‘When I look back at photos from my time in Africa, it’s weird to think that’s where the parasite crawled up my penis.</p>
      <p>‘That wasn’t exactly how I imagined the trip of a lifetime with my friends going – the whole experience was surreal and strange.’</p>
      <p>He and his friends went on the trip in August 2017, travelling from Zambia to Zimbabwe, before visiting Malawi for five days.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until October 2018, over a year later, that he began to lose feeling in his legs.</p>
      <p>He didn’t connect it at first to swimming in the lake, at first assuming it was fatigue from cycling.</p>
      <p>However, the symptoms didn’t improve and started to get worse.</p>
      <p>Within a few weeks it was taking him five minutes to climb up 15 steps to his flat.</p>

      <p>He went to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in November 2018 when he woke up sweating uncontrollably, and started to worry he had MS or motor neurone disease.</p>
      <p>Doctors gave him antibiotics and sent him home, but a week later with things still getting worse, he went back again.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I explained to them that something serious was going on.</p>
      <p>‘I went to the neurology department, and they did blood tests to see what was up.</p>
      <p>‘They determined quite quickly that my immune system was attacking my spine, leading to the loss of control of my legs.</p>
      <p>‘I was put on a six-month course of steroids to counter this, but they didn’t actually know what had caused this.’</p>

      <p>Doctors from the Hospital For Tropical Diseases eventually diagnosed him correctly just before Christmas and he was given suitable medication.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘That killed the infection but I was left basically debilitated.’</p>

      <p>He had to spend three months in hospital using a wheelchair, then four months on crutches, until April.</p>
      <p>He also had to deal with extreme acne caused by steroids, diarrhoea, and using a catheter because he couldn’t use the loo.</p>
      <p>James said: ‘The pain has been like nothing I’ve ever know. At times, it has been an excruciating physical pain that’s been debilitating.</p>
      <p>“Early in my recovery – sometime in January – I had a really terrible acne outbreak that went all down my back and down my arms.</p>
      <p>‘I couldn’t sleep for a month because lying on my back hurt. I couldn’t really be under running water either, so I had to shower my front instead.</p>
      <p>‘In January, I couldn’t use the toilet normally, so had to use a catheter. That was quite embarrassing for me because it’s not something you associate with young guys.</p>
      <p>James also lost his appetite and struggled to maintain a sex life with his girlfriend.</p>
      <p>‘My girlfriend couldn’t hug me because just to touch me hurt and we’ve not been intimate with each other because it’s just too painful for me,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘I’ll certainly think twice before taking a dip in Lake Malawi.’</p>
