      <p>Medicinal cannabis producer LeafCann has been approved for cannabis research and medical cannabis for three years, meaning it can get to work building a $50 million start-up cultivation and processing centre.</p>
      <p>As well as doubling the size of the existing research facility in Adelaide, it’ll be the first factory in the world to produce oil from plant genes to distribute to patients.</p>

      <p>Construction work on the factory is expected to begin next year, creating between 200 and 800 jobs.</p>
      <p>However, according to LeafCann co-founder and CEO Elisabetta Faenza, the location of the factory will remain confidential for ‘security’ and ‘commercial reasons’.</p>

      </p>
      <blockquote>It is the largest manufacturing crop of any Australian licence for medicinal cannabis – so it’s a substantial manufacturing facility that has the capacity to produce many tonnes of extracted oil.<br/><br/>At full capacity the medicinal cannabis produced by LeafCann in South Australia will help treat 160,000 patients a year. We will be the first in the world to do this throughout the entire supply chain and SA is the headquarters of it all.</blockquote>
      <p>In Australia alone, the medicinal marijuana industry is expected to be worth $1 billion by 2025.</p>

      <p>Just recently, two cannabis-based medicines used to treat epilepsy and multiple sclerosis (MS) <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/news/two-cannabis-based-medicines-have-been-approved-for-use-by-the-nhs/">were approved for use by the NHS.</a></p>
      <p>However, facing the rigmarole of actually securing medicinal marijuana, <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/news/medicinal-cannabis-will-be-given-to-20000-british-patients-in-first-major-trial-of-drugs-impact/">the first major trial of the drug in the UK has launched</a>, with 20,000 patients to test its impact on a range of conditions.</p>
      <p>If you’re a keen smoker in the US (in a state where the drug is legalised, of course), there’s an opportunity for you to earn $36,000 a year smoking weed every day – <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/health/marijuana-company-will-pay-you-28000-a-year-to-smoke-weed-every-day/">just click here</a>.</p>
