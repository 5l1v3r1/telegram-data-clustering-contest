        <b>Little Mix made the most of their final night in Manchester by hitting the clubs after their latest tour show, but band member Jesy Nelson had more of a cosy idea in mind for her Saturday night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Woman Like Me singers were spotted heading to Club Liv in Manchester’s city centre yesterday evening after headlining the third and final night at Manchester Arena on their LM5 Tour.</p>
      <p>And the girl group made sure to slay, with Perrie Edwards showing off those abs in an orange crop top while serving plenty of thigh action thanks to a risky high side split.</p>
      <p>Any false move and she could have suffered a serious wardrobe malfunction. The 26-year-old singer sported a whole new look with a cropped blonde bob hairstyle, ditching the long do she’s sported for years.</p>
      <p>Jade Thirlwall sent a bold message with her outfit, donning a t-shirt dress with lyrics from Little Mix’s song Wasabi, which said: ‘Love me, hate me, praise me, either way, you talk about me,’ alongside a pair of silver sparkly thigh-high boots.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Leigh-Anne Pinnock kept it simple yet chic in matching denim with an orange bralette under her jean jacket.</p>
      <p>Noticeably missing in action was Jesy, 28, who shared Instagram stories of her playing around with her pet dog in bed.</p>

      <p>To be fair, after energetically dancing around on stage for the best part of two hours, a night in bed sounds rather appealing.</p>
      <p>Little Mix’s tour will now move onto Leeds for two nights before rounding off with a further two nights at London’s O2 Arena later this week. The band were originally expected to bring the LM5 Tour to Australia in December but they cancelled the leg to ‘focus on recording new music’.</p>
      <p>There will be little time to rest though as Little Mix are also <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/17/little-mix-confirm-new-talent-show-the-search-and-wannabe-popstars-are-able-to-apply-now-10937980/">working on their brand new TV series, Little Mix: The Search</a>, which will see them on the hunt for a new band to support them on their next tour.</p>

      <p>However, it’s put them in the line of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/simon-cowell-compares-little-mix-rivalry-blue-versus-oasis-x-factor-clash-continues-11090451/">rivalry with their former boss Simon Cowell</a>, who has just <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/simon-cowell-axes-x-factor-stars-series-rival-little-mix-talent-show-battle-11037149/">announced the new X Factor: The Band</a> which will similarly look for the next big pop group.</p>
      <p>Addressing the competition, Simon told Bang Showbiz: ‘This is always supposed to be fun. So sometimes when you read the headlines, “CRISIS, I’m competing with Little Mix”, it’s brilliant.</p>

      <p>‘It’s like when Oasis and Blur were putting records out. You want that, you need that kind of fun rivalry, we’re competitive, we all want to win, it’s fun and that’s the way I take it.’</p>
