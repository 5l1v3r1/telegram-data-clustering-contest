      <h1>City calls for new life for under-used art space</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Linda Morris</a></address>
      <p>A cavernous cultural space beneath Barangaroo has been lying empty for half the year, sparking renewed calls for it to be converted to Sydney's first centre celebrating Indigenous culture.</p>
      <p>The Cutaway, a super-sized concrete bunker opened with the promise of providing a much-needed space to host art exhibitions, opera and food events, has been booked for around 170 days this year, documents obtained by the <i>Herald</i> show.</p>
      <p>Revenue from commercial bookings rose from $271,986 in 2017 to $368,740 in 2018 but is expected to fall to a forecast $89,231 this year.</p>
      <p>The site's under-utilisation has prompted the City of Sydney council to call on the NSW government to set up an Indigenous-led advisory board to consider its use as a national centre to celebrate and share Indigenous cultures, with sufficient funding to ensure its sustainability.</p>

      <p>"The city understands that Barangaroo has been suggested as a possible site for a national centre celebrating and sharing the cultures of the First Peoples of Australia," a spokesperson for the council said. "The city is supportive of the creation of a national centre."</p>
      <p>Larger than a football field, the Cutaway was created by converting the headland from a flat wharf to parkland and is regarded as the missing link in a waterfront arts precinct that extends from Walsh Bay to the Sydney Opera House.</p>
      <p>Poor acoustics have restricted the use of the space for music and concerts with markets, the occasional dinner, one-off photographic shoots for alcohol and car advertisements, and filming among the popular uses, the documents obtained under Freedom of Information laws indicate.</p>
      <p>The Cutaway is subject to noise restrictions and maintenance shutdowns with access cut for all of August and the site indirectly impacted by construction of the Sydney Metro Project.</p>
      <p>In January, the Cutaway was used mainly by Sydney Festival for storage, and it has been booked in the lead-up to New Year's Eve celebrations, it's longest booking run coming from the theatrical skateboard performance troupe, <a href="https://www.bighart.org/projects/skate/">BigHART which took over the site for three months in March.</a></p>

      <p>Commercial bookings particularly dropped off in July, coinciding with the abolition of the Barangaroo Delivery Authority and the transfer of its functions to Infrastructure NSW.</p>
      <p>Originally <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-giul4d.html">it had been hoped the space would host a permanent centre for Indigenous arts and culture</a> and has not been dismissed with cultural planners torn between providing a cultural arts centre close to Indigenous communities in western Sydney, possibly in association with the relocated Powerhouse Museum, and one in the CBD to capture tourists.</p>
      <p>Alison Page and Nik Lachajczak's 10-minute audiovisual installation <i>Wellama, </i>which shows scenes of Eora fisherwomen and camps reference paintings commissioned in the early colony<i>, </i>has been installed at Cutaway.</p>
      <p>The Cutaway had hosted a number of exciting arts and cultural events this year, including Sydney Festival events, corporate functions and a three-month performance series and the government continued to consider how best to use the space once the transformation of the Barangaroo precinct is complete, a spokesperson for Infrastructure NSW said.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year the Cutaway had been considered a potential site for a 1500-seat lyric theatre but it was ruled out as its ceiling was too low to accommodate a theatrical rigging system that enable stage crew to shift curtains, lights, scenery and stage effects.</p>
      <p>Wesley Enoch, chairman of the NSW government's eight-member Aboriginal arts and culture funding board, could not be contacted for comment.</p>
