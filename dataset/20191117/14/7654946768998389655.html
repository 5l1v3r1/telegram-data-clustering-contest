      <p><b>Houston Texans (+4) over BALTIMORE RAVENS:</b> Deshaun Watson vs. Lamar Jackson? Sign us up. Baltimore is a handful, for certain, though the Ravens can get casual regarding their defense when the offense is humming behind Action Jackson. Texans are taking their best shot this season, and expect Houston’s secondary to be healthier than it’s been. Texans hang tough, for one unit.</p>
      <p><b>LOS ANGELES RAMS-Chicago Bears Under 40¹/₂:</b> Last year’s late-season Sunday night clash between these two saw the West Coasters shrivel when enduring sub-freezing temps at Soldier Field, misfiring repeatedly on offense. It’ll be some 40 degrees warmer, but that still leaves Rams QB Jared Goff exposed to that Bears defense. With both sides on the fringes of the playoff hunt, expect conservatism will rule. Bears QB Mitchell Trubisky has turned it over just three times this year. The Rams likely will be without WR Brandin Cooks, and their offensive line is a mess. Points will be at a premium. Under, for one unit.</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 1-1. Vikings (W). Panthers (L).<br/><b>Season:</b> 13-6-1.</p>
