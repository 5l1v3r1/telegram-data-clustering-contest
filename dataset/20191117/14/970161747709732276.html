      <h1>Woman has baby at 90mph on M6 after loose dog and floods derail birth plan</h1>

      <p>When a woman goes into labour, she normally hopes for a calm atmosphere and an abundance of trained medical staff around her.</p>
      <p>But you don’t always get what you wish for.</p>
      <p>Hannah Rowlinson, 32, got floods, a dog on the loose and a 90mph drive down the M6 when she gave birth.</p>
      <p>She and husband Joel had planned to welcome daughter Viola Florence into the world in a birthing pool at home.</p>
      <p>Hannah was six days late and went into labour at around 4pm on October 24 but her contractions were slow, continuing over the next 48 hours.</p>
      <p>The couple – who already had a son, two-year-old Sebastian – were told to expect a midwife from Leighton Hospital on October 26.</p>
      <p>However, they received a phone call saying the hospital was too busy and telling the expectant mum to come in.</p>

      <p>But the hospital called again soon after to say there were no beds available and that Hannah and Joel would have to go to Royal Stoke, which is a 45 minute drive from their house in Holmes Chapel.</p>

      <p>Joel’s phone battery died after getting into the car and Hannah was forced to type the hospital address into her phone while she had contractions.</p>
      <p>When they finally hit the road, the couple hit heavy flooding and traffic, with reports of a dog loose on the M6 as well.</p>
      <p>After Hannah told her husband that she would be giving birth to the baby ‘imminently’, they diverted onto a bumpy back lane to escape motorway queues.</p>
      <p>However, the back roads were equally as busy, so Hannah’s mum, who was in the back of the car, was forced to ring 999.</p>
      <p>After the family pulled into a residential estate in Sandbach, the phone operator began to guide them through the process of preparing a birth.</p>
      <p>Hannah’s mum ran down the road ‘frantically’ waving her arms and stopped a passing motorcycle unit police car.</p>

      <p>Two PCs ‘secured the scene’ and began to knock on doors, asking if nearby residents had any spare towels they could use.</p>
      <p>At one point, a woman came out of her house and mopped Hannah’s head through the car window with a flannel.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, paramedics Dave Knibbs and Garry Thompson made it in the nick of time.</p>
      <p>After just seven minutes of being in the ambulance, the baby’s head was crowning.</p>
      <p>Hannah told <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/i-baby-m6-90mph-how-3533730?_ga=2.181819491.591494678.1573891963-1770294237.1573891963">Stoke-on-Trent Live</a>: ‘We were going at 90mph down the motorway and I asked the paramedics to pull over because the baby was coming.</p>

      <p>‘The roads were bedlam because of the floods – I didn’t even know where I was.</p>
      <p>‘There was a coned off area and he pulled in. I did one more push and she was out.</p>

      <p>She added: ‘Yes, it was not the birth I was expecting but everyone was so incredible.</p>
      <p>‘There are things in your life that will stick with you forever and this is definitely one of them. I don’t have words to describe how grateful I am.</p>
      <p>‘I will never forget those two paramedics. Some times things don’t go to plan, but who needs a plan when you have Garry and Dave?’</p>
