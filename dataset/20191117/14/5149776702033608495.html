      <h1>The ‘heartbreaking’ Stuart Pearce story Gareth Southgate will use to inspire England</h1>
      <h2>England are a nation rejuvenated since Gareth Southgate took over three years ago</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:51:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:51</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Southgate will use painful memories of England’s cruel exit from Euro 96 to inspire the current generation of Three Lions stars.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/england-boss-gareth-southgate-keeping-3296461">England boss Southgate</a> has masterminded comfortable qualification for next summer’s European Championships and hopes the threat of failure will spur his young troops on.</p>
      <p>Come the summer, it will be 24 years since <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/england-any-desire-successful-world-1704438">Southgate</a>’s penalty miss against Germany at Wembley in the semi-final, an outcome which moved the then 25-year-old to tears.</p>
      <p>Southgate recalls the moment that <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> legend and former manager <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/history/agonising-moment-nottingham-forest-legend-1757236">Stuart Pearce</a> announced that game would be his last for the Three Lions.</p>

      <p>“When we lost in ’96, the most heartbreaking thing for me was when Stuart Pearce retired on the bus home,” said Southgate.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/stuart-pearce">Stuart</a> then came back – twice! But he actually did retire on the bus on the way home and that was the moment when it really sunk in.</p>
      <p>“I thought: ‘Oh my god, that was his last chance.’ It was my first tournament – and when it’s your first tournament you think there will be loads more.”</p>
      <p>That team under Terry Venables, with the likes of Southgate, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-legend-stuart-pearce-3489873">Pearce</a>, Alan Shearer and Paul Gascoigne looked like it might be the first to win a major tournament since 1966 before disaster struck against the Germans, though the England boss believes this squad may not peak for a while yet.</p>
      <p>“The group we have now is slightly different, because I think most of the players are going to peak in two or four years’ time,” he said.</p>

      <p>“But we have to find a way to get the maximum out of them, as we did two summers ago. Let’s see how far we can get.”</p>
      <p>“We have got some excellent players, but I would imagine Sven Goran-Eriksson thought the same of Beckham, Paul Scholes, Michael Carrick, Steve Gerrard and Frank ­Lampard.</p>
      <p>“If you’re the England manager, you’re normally in a reasonably privileged position.</p>
      <p>“But we have given young players their opportunity ahead of their time – and that has given us a greater depth.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got competition now because guys believe they’ve got a chance. It will be a ­brilliant experience to have the group matches at home, but then we’re going to have to go on the road and win too.</p>
      <p>“We could end up playing Spain in Rome – and there’s all sorts of other possible ties.”</p>
