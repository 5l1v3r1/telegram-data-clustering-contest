      <h1>Kremlin Adviser Says Summit On Ukraine Conflict May Happen In 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:00:26+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">RFE/RL</a></address>
      <p>A senior Kremlin adviser said that a major summit aimed at resolving the more-than-five-year-old conflict in Ukraine could be held before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The November 17 comments by Yury Ushakov on state-run channel television echoed similar remarks from a Kremlin spokesman, a signal that the Kremlin was supportive of new efforts to find an end to the war that has killed more than 13,000 people since 2014</p>
      <p>France last week announced that a meeting of leaders of France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine had been scheduled for December 9, but there has been no confirmation from Moscow.</p>
      <p>Speaking on November 17 on Rossia-1 TV, Ushakov said that a meeting would be held this year.</p>
      <p>"I think there will be a chance to organize [the summit] this year," Ushakov said. "I can't say the exact date, because it is still under discussion, but, obviously, this year."</p>
      <p>Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that any potential summit would not be directly tied to the <b><a href="https://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=3210730">adoption of a special status</a></b> for eastern Ukraine. That has been a sticking point in past negotiations.</p>
      <p>Kyiv and Moscow have made substantive steps to ease tensions, more than five years after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula and fomented a separatist war in eastern Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the two sides exchanged prisoners for the first time. And this month, Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed fighters began withdrawing from a village in eastern Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Also on November 17, Russia began towing three captured Ukrainian Navy ships away from a Crimea port, in what appeared to be a move toward returning the ships to Kyiv.</p>
