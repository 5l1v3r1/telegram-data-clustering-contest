      <h1>WATCH: From Mosul to Baghdad, a song of solidarity and resistance</h1>

      <p><b>MOSUL,IRAQ: </b>While Baghdad anti-regime protesters have clashed with riot police, their supporters in Mosul are using art to fight for change, with a new take on the resistance anthem “<i>Bella Ciao</i>“.</p>
      <p>In a viral music video clip, the World War II-era Italian anti-fascist song has been tweaked to <i>Blaya Chara </i>— meaning “no way out” in Iraqi dialect.</p>
      <p>It captures the fatalistic sentiment many young Iraqis hold towards their violence-torn homeland.</p>

      <p>“I don’t have heating, not a cent to spend. Why would I even study if there’s no way out?” sings one gaunt performer, huddled under a blanket in a gutted building.</p>

      <p>Others in the video, which has scored hundreds of thousands of hits despite frequent internet blackouts, hold up signs that read “Justice for our martyrs” and “I want my rights.”</p>
      <p>Like activists elsewhere, they borrow from popular culture, donning the red jumpsuits and Dali masks of the Spanish Netflix hit series <i>La Casa de Papel (Money Heist)</i>, which has revived the Italian classic.</p>

      <p>Much of Iraq, especially Baghdad and the Shiite-majority south, has been gripped by a wave of street protests since October 1, decrying a lack of jobs, poor public services and endemic corruption.</p>
      <p>But in Mosul, a mostly-Sunni city recaptured from the Islamic State (IS) militant group two years ago, social and political pressures have kept demonstrators from coming out in large numbers.</p>
      <p>“The song is an artistic message of solidarity from Mosul to the protesters to say: our hearts are with you,” said 25-year-old Abdulrahman al-Rubaye, the clip’s director.</p>
      <p>The video opens with a despondent mechanic played by Mohammed Bakri, 26, who heads the team of 14 performers that produced the song.</p>

      <p>“We bought costumes, painted our own masks and filmed in the streets or in our own homes,” said the father-of-two who founded the performance troupe in 2016.</p>
      <p>He has dreamed of taking to the streets to demonstrate like his compatriots in Baghdad and the south, but said that “our situation in Mosul is exceptional and we can’t protest”.</p>
      <p>Sunni communities in the country’s north and west have indeed stayed clear of the protest movement, despite the desperate state of public services there after years of war and neglect.</p>
      <p>IS swept through their hometowns in 2014 and the three-year battle to oust the militants left neighbourhoods and public infrastructure in ruins.</p>

      <p>But residents say any street protests would be met with accusations that they are sympathetic to IS, which could lead to a counter-terrorism charge punishable by death.</p>
      <p>Or, they fear, they could be painted as fans of Saddam Hussein, the brutal ex-dictator deposed in the US-led invasion of 2003 which paved the way for the current political system.</p>
      <p>Authorities in Baghdad have already cast the protests as a nefarious conspiracy seeking to bring ‘chaos’ to Iraq.</p>
      <p>Without the street as an option, Bakri turned to the screen.<br/>“With art, we can support the movement our own way. I think that this way, we can speak in the name of all Iraqis,” he said.</p>

      <p>The team was able to produce the video in a mere 12 hours and upload it just before authorities cut off the internet.</p>
      <p>For Jihan Mazouri, a 23-year-old student and actress, her role in the film was “the least she could do” to back peaceful protesters further south.</p>

      <p>Her character, dressed in a black robe and veil covering half her face, desperately pulls handfuls of tissues as she sings about “a future with no way out”.<br/>“People have died or gotten hurt in these peaceful protests, so whatever we do is incomparable to their huge national sacrifices,” she said.</p>
      <p>After the success of the first video, Mazouri and the rest of the team decided to see the beating heart of Baghdad’s protests with their own eyes.</p>

      <p>They travelled to the protest epicentre, the capital’s Tahrir (Liberation) Square, where they performed a classic Arabic ballad by Lebanese diva Fayrouz.</p>
      <p>But, in another creative twist, their version is an ode to the now-famous tuk-tuks, three-wheeled rickshaws that have ferried wounded protesters to field clinics or delivered food and water to those occupying Tahrir.</p>
      <p>Well over 300 people have lost their lives to bullets and often lethal tear gas canisters, and activists say they are being threatened, kidnapped and assaulted.</p>
      <p>In Mosul, Rubaye, the director, said Iraqis are becoming more brave.<br/>“People have confidence in themselves and we are not silent about what happens to us,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We are not afraid anymore.”</p>
