      <h2>BJP urges Centre to ensure only TSRTC operates such outlets</h2>

      <p>The Bharatiya Janata Party on Sunday urged Union Minister for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Steel Dharmendra Pradhan to cancel the dealerships of the retail fuel outlets of ‘private persons’ inside TSRTC properties and order a probe into it.</p>
      <p>Party president K. Laxman in a communication to the Union Minister, a copy of which was released to the media here on Sunday, stated that the TSRTC has prime lands and properties in various districts. The RTC wanted to mobilize resources by giving their lands to oil companies on lease and run the retail outlets.</p>
      <p>Oil firms like HPCL and IOCL had entered into a memorandum of understanding with TSRTC with the former identifying about 90 sites and later in 32 sites to operate the retail outlets. As per the MOU, the oil companies would pay monthly lease amount and allot dealerships to TSRTC, but due to the “involvement of higher-ups in TRS government”, the spirit of the deal has been violated with dealerships being given to TRS leaders, he alleged.</p>
      <p>“Due to this 60% of the dealer commission will go to the private persons and only 40% of the commission goes into the TSRTC account. It is established that this violation is a clear cut scam by the TSRTC,” charged Mr. Laxman in his communication.</p>
      <p>Mr. Laxman pointed out that about 49,000 TSRTC employees have been on strike since October 5 without any salaries. “On the one hand, the government says TSRTC is running under losses and on the other hand the government has been giving away prime properties and dealerships to private persons, which cause loss to the Corporation. The Oil Ministry should also ensure such retail outlets are run only by the TSRTC,” he added.</p>
