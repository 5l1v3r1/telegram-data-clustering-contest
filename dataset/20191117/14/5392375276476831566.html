      <p>Honor V30 Will Also be Available in a PRO Version<br/>5 (100%) 2 votes</p>
      <p>Honor’s strategy and brand development manager, Zhang Xiaoyun, just revealed a very interesting detail over on Chinese social Weibo. Zhang did indeed confirm there’ll be a Honor V30 Pro as well. Thus the basic Honor V30 won’t be the only device we’ll see hitting the market next week.</p>

      <p>The “revelation” wasn’t actually planned, or so we’d like to believe. The Honor V30 Pro name does indeed appear in the “device it was sent from area”; which basically means Zhang Xiaoyun sent the Weibo message from the upcoming device.</p>
      <p>This isn’t even the first time the Honor V30 series surfaces online in such way. Some time back, Honor’s Vice President had the same “problem” which at the time confirmed the existence of a V30 series.</p>

      <p>Either way, since the company has already announced an official launch event in Beijing on November 26th, this isn’t a real scoop. We just learned that Honor’s first 5G flagship phone will be coming with a Pro variant as well. Alternatively, the Pro model could be the only one featuring the next generation network standard.</p>
      <p>As far as specs are concerned, the Honor V30 is expected to pack flagship-grade hardware. This means we’ll probably find the Huawie Kirin 990 CPU along with its support for NSA and SA dual-mode 5G.</p>

      <p>The V30 series by Honor could also feature the much talked about “<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/?s=matrix">Matrix Camera</a>” technology. According to previous rumors this tech should create a new mobile photography experience such as long-distance and close-range dual recording, with the help of multiple lenses and AI ​​artificial intelligence algorithms.</p>
      <p>Design wise, the V30 will most likely adopt a pill-shaped punch-hole screen with two cameras, very slim bezels and a high screen to body ratio.</p>
