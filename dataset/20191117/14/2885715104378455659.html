      <p>Former Bangladesh captain Aminul Islam said India will be huge favourites in the upcoming Day/Night Test, which will be played in Kolkata from November 22, because of the potency of the Indian pace attack.</p>
      <p>The Kolkata Test, the second match of the series, will be the first Test to be played with the pink ball on Indian soil.</p>

      <p>Islam told PTI on Sunday, “The way we saw the variation of pace bowling by (Mohammed) Shami, Ishant (Sharma) and (Umesh) Yadav, they will get a lot of advantage with this pink ball. Wherever you play, you get that extra breeze in the evening. India will take a lot of advantage of that.”</p>
      <p>Islam, the first Bangladeshi Test centurion, said the current Indian pace attack is like the lethal West Indian pace attack of the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
      <p>“Earlier, we had seen spinners like Anil Kumble leading Indian bowling but now it’s about the pacers. This is the big transformation in Indian cricket. They have their best bowling attack ever, it’s like the way the West Indians dominated the pace attack (in the world) at one point of time,” he said.</p>
      <p>West Indies dominated world cricket in the 1970s and 1980s on the back of the ‘Horsemen of the Apocalypse’ – Andy Roberts, Joel Garner, Collin Croft, Michael Holding and Malcolm Marshall – burning up pitches around the world with their pace.</p>
      <p>India’s pace attack is gradually taking on a similar reputation.</p>

      <p>There was no Jasprit Bumrah but <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mohammed-shami/">Mohammed Shami</a>, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ishant-sharma/">Ishant Sharma</a> and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/umesh-yadav/">Umesh Yadav</a> were ruthless and unplayable as Bangladeshi batsmen danced to their tunes and were skittled out for just 150 in the opening Test. India registered an inning victory in the match and will be looking to continue their dominance in Kolkata.</p>
