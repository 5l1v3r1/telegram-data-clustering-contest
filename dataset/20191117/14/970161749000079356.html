        <b>England have already booked their spot at Euro 2020, but will complete their qualification process away to Kosovo on Sunday evening.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Three Lions are coming off a resounding 7-0 walloping of Montenegro on Thursday at Wembley and will be full of confidence as they head to Pristina.</p>
      <p>Kosovo have had an impressive campaign, but cannot make it into the tournament, with Czech Republic already guaranteeing second place in Group A.</p>
      <p>However, they will be looking to finish off their campaign in style and produce another exciting performance after their thrilling 5-3 defeat to England in Southampton earlier in the process.</p>
      <p>Gareth Southgate will be making a number of changes to his team with qualification already secured, but will be looking to score a hatful of goals again after his side have netted 33 times in just seven matches so far.</p>
