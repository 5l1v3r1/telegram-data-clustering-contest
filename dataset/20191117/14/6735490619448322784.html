      <p>While “Joker” has been laughing all the way to the bank thanks to a worldwide box-office tally in excess of $1 billion, the Joaquin Phoenix-starring feature received a special VIP screening on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>In fact, a tweet from CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz reveals that a White House official told him that President Donald Trump hosted a special screening of the film.</p>

      <p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/trump-hosts-white-house-screening-of-joker-162846043.html"><i>Yahoo</i> News</a> reports a senior White House official confirmed Trump screened the movie for several guests, including “family, friends and some staff.”</p>
      <p>According to the official, Trump liked the film — even though “Joker” features two-time Oscar winner and vociferous Trump critic Robert De Niro.</p>

      <p>Then again, perhaps he fast-forwarded through De Niro’s scenes; a 1997 profile of Trump in the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/05/19/trump-solo"><i>New Yorker</i></a> revealed his propensity to fast-forward through all that boring exposition and plot-related stuff in order to get to the action scenes, with a goal of trying “to get this two-hour movie down to forty-five minutes.”</p>
      <p>The profile also singled out one of Trump’s all-time cinematic favourites: Jean Claude Van Damme’s “Bloodsport”, which he described as “an incredible, fantastic movie.”</p>
