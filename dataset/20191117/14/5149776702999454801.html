      <h1>Landlords warn tenants that rents will soar as city council doubles their fees</h1>
      <h2>Fewer homes to rent in the city as landlords move to Broxtowe and Rushcliffe</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:15:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Jarram</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham tenants have been warned their rents will rise as the costs of a controversial council-run licensing scheme soar.</p>
      <p>Landlords believe the hike is "another nail in the coffin", with property owners selling up and moving to Broxtowe and Rushcliffe to escape the city 'tax.'</p>
      <p>Nottingham City Council launched selective licensing in August 2018 to crack down on bad landlords who leave properties in poor or unsafe conditions.</p>
      <p>Around 32,000 properties in the city need a licence to ensure their properties are meeting the criteria, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/council-fines-landlords-84000-selective-3322085">with fines of up to £30,000 for those who fail to join the scheme.</a></p>
      <p>The council has received just over half.</p>
      <p>To obtain a licence, accredited landlords must pay £480 per property while non-accredited pay £780.</p>
      <p>This is now set to rise to £670 (accredited) and £890 (non-accredited) in March 2020.</p>
      <p>Major concerns have been raised that good landlords are being penalised, and already meet the criteria set out by the council.</p>
      <p>Giles Inman, business development manager at East Midlands Property Owners Group based in Lenton, which represents around 600 landlords, said the hike will have a devastating effect.</p>
      <p>He said: "It is clearly going to bring higher rents and we are going to see smaller landlords selling up. It is also going to fuel the homelessness problem in the city.</p>
      <p>"What they should be doing is having an action plan to fine the applicants they are chasing. It is just another nail in the coffin for Nottingham landlords.</p>
      <p>"This is a PR disaster. It is just telling businesses they are being taxed and taxed. We are businesses, not husbands and wives running a cottage industry.</p>

      <p>"I can't think of another scheme that has put their fees up so soon after it has started.</p>
      <p>"It is not good enough. We want to offer affordable rents but we are being squeezed out."</p>
      <p>He said the scheme had done very little in terms of inspecting landlords and the hike would affect "new landlords and existing landlords that are expanding their portfolio."</p>
      <p>He added: "All the existing ones that have paid will have to pay again in August 2023 when it comes up for renewal.</p>
      <p>"Are they going to keep sticking it up? We have no consistency or a plan of action.</p>
      <p>"This scheme is not doing what it is says it is doing. It was a scheme to raise standards and reduce anti-social behaviour.</p>
      <p>"If they are not inspecting how can you protect and safeguard tenants."</p>
      <p>The city council has not said how many inspections it has carried out, but landlords believe it is around 176 with a workforce of around 75 staff to run the scheme.</p>
      <p>The council said the value of the scheme has risen by £173,000 to an estimated £24.2m.</p>
      <p>The local authority also state there "continues to be a number of risks and uncertainities regarding the scheme."</p>

      <p>Last month,<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/selective-licensing-blamed-nottingham-reaching-3435063"> Zoopla revealed Nottingham had the highest percentage rise in rent</a> compared to anywhere else in the country.</p>
      <p>Rental growth in Nottingham has risen from 4.3 percent to 5.4 percent over the space of a year with the average rent being £661.</p>
      <p>The percentage rise is higher than Leeds, Bristol, Leicester, Derby, York, Brighton, Liverpool and Sheffield, but this does not mean tenants pay more in Nottingham compared to other cities.</p>
      <p>When the licensing scheme was launched, landlords said they would have to pass the licensing burden onto tenants.</p>
      <p>They said rent would rise by around £25 a month for tenants, but with the new licensing fee increase this is now set to be even higher.</p>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/politics">Nottingham City Council</a> spokeswoman said: "We are increasing fees for individual house licences.</p>
      <p>"The scheme is self-funding and the council has reviewed the licensing process and found it wasn’t recovering all of the costs, so fees have to increase to reflect that – but it remains the case that we are not allowed to make a profit from licence fees.</p>
      <p>"Over 18,000 landlords have already applied at the lower rate and we will work to engage with landlords who are not registered for the scheme - we would urge any of them to apply before the price rise at the end of March.</p>
      <p>"We are also changing the way licences are applied to blocks of flats in the city, so that instead of applying for each individual apartment, there is the option for an applicant to apply to licence the whole block - subject to certain criteria being met within the new policy."</p>
