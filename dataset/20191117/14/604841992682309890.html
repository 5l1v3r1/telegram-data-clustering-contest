      <p>Meath's last All-Ireland SFC-winning captain Graham Geraghty had medals stolen in a burglary at his Athboy home on Friday night.</p>
      <p>An appeal has been launched on his wife Amanda's Facebook page for assistance in tracking down the medals and getting them returned. She says the couple is offering a large reward for anyone who can give information about the theft of Graham's six Leinster medals won over 11 years - three seniors, two under-21s, and a minor.</p>
      <p>"They broke into our home on Friday night while our three children were here and stole my husband's six Leinster medals.</p>
      <p>"Please return them as they are not worth much in monetary value but it took blood sweat and tears to win these over a period of 11 years.</p>
      <p>"A lifetime of memories taken."</p>
      <p>Graham Geraghty captained Meath to the county's last All-Ireland success in 1999 at Croke Park against Cork. </p>
      <p>That was another first that Meath achieved in the GAA history books when Graham Geraghty became the first captain to receive the Sam Maguire Cup in the centre of the pitch at Croke Park after a new format for the handing over of the trophy was introduced by the GAA.</p>
