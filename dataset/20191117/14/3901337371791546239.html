      <p>As reported in this week’s issue of Soccer Laduma, there are question marks about the Bafana Bafana internationals future in Tshwane after five seasons with the club, and any potential suitors would be able to approach him come January 1.</p>
      <p>Furman signed a new deal with SuperSport last season that will see him through until the end of the 2019/20 campaign – however, there have now been suggestions that this one could be his last in the country.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old has played over 150 games for the club - lifting four titles in the process – since joining them back in 2015, winning both the Nedbank Cup and MTN8 trophy on two occasions each, and would leave a big hole in the club’s midfield if he was to move on.</p>
      <p>Since his arrival at the club, Furman has missed 23 Absa Premiership games under the likes of Gordon Igesund, Stuart Baxter, Kaitano Tembo and Eric Tinkler, and it says something about his importance that just four of those 23 games have resulted in victory.</p>
      <p>While SuperSport do have a wealth of talent coming through their system in midfield such as Teboho Mokoena, Sipho Mbule and Aubrey Modiba, it remains to be seen whether any of them will be able to take on the holding midfielder role that Furman has made his own as skipper of the club.</p>

      <p>SuperSport are expected to get a bit of business done in the January transfer window in the middle of what has already been a successful season following their MTN8 victory earlier in the year. </p>
