      <h1>Chilean singer Mon Laferte goes topless at Latin Grammys in support of protests</h1>

      <p>TORONTO -- Chilean singer Mon Laferte exposed her breasts on the red carpet at the <a href="https://www.latingrammy.com/en">Latin Grammys</a> Thursday, revealing a political message written across her chest in support of anti-government protests in her country.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old artist walked the red carpet in a black belted coat, removing it to reveal a hand-written message that read, “En Chile torturan violan y matan,” which translates to “In Chile, they torture, rape and kill.”</p>
      <p>At least 20 people have died during violent anti-government clashes in Chile over the last month.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/chile-president-promotes-minimum-wage-hike-to-quell-unrest-1.4673885">unrest began in October</a> over a hike to subway fares, but has grown into a massive movement demanding a broad span of political and economic changes.</p>
      <p>The violent clashes have led to thousands of arrests and police brutality, including an incident where hundreds were blinded after police fired pellet guns during demonstrations.</p>
      <p>Chile’s right-centre government has responded with a series of proposed changes, including a minimum-wage increase, but many Chileans call these moves a Band-Aid solution to decades-old social inequality that has been unresolved since Chile returned to democracy in 1990 after a 17-year dictatorship.</p>
      <p>Laferte, who won the Grammy for best alternative album, was praised on social media for supporting her home country. In an Instagram post, the singer posted a picture from her red carpet stunt writing, “My free body for a free homeland.”</p>

      <p>On Saturday, the Chilean artist released a new song titled <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B45kHUVlsje/">“Plata Ta Ta.”</a> According to an Instagram post, translated from Spanish, the singer said she recorded the song after feeling “uncomfortable, sad and angry about everything that happens in Chile.”</p>
      <p>“So I send you the message again. We are not afraid,” reads the post.</p>
      <p>Protesters won a victory Friday after the national congress agreed to hold a referendum next year to draft a new constitution. However, politicians say they have to figure out how to move the process along quickly in the midst of escalating violence.</p>
