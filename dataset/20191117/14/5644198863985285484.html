      <p>Saudi Aramco does not plan to market its domestic initial public offering (IPO) in the United States, two sources familiar with the matter said.</p>
      <p>DUBAI: Saudi Aramco does not plan to market its domestic initial public offering (IPO) in the United States, two sources familiar with the matter said.</p>
      <p>Aramco had said in its IPO prospectus earlier this month that the offering of shares would rely on the 144A rule of the U.S. Securities Act, which allows a non-U.S. issuer to tap the U.S. market.</p>

      <p>The sources said Aramco will no longer rely on that rule, meaning it will not market the shares in the United States.</p>
      <p>Aramco did not immediately respond to a comment request.</p>
