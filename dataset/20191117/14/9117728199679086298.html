        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sergio-perez">Sergio Perez</a> believes the<a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/racing-point"> Racing Point</a> team can recover from their woes in qualifying on Saturday by chasing hard for points in the<a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/brazilian-grand-prix"> Brazilian Grand Prix</a>.

      <p>Racing Point have plenty to fight for in the remaining two Grands Prix. They sit just one point ahead of <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-toro-rosso">Toro Rosso</a> who recorded mixed results in qualifying. </p>
      <p><i>“It was very tight today and ultimately we didn’t have the pace we needed to make the top ten. The margins were very close – as they always are here – but I think we will have a better race car tomorrow and hotter conditions should play to our advantage. Although it’s disappointing to qualify in P15, I believe we can recover tomorrow and that we can aim for points,"</i> Perez said. </p>

      <p>On the other side of the garage, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lance-stroll">Lance Stroll</a> couldn't out-qualify Perez. The Canadian believes Racing Point's car isn't suited to the track but insists the Pink Panthers will benefit from the higher temperatures. </p>
      <p><i>“It’s been a challenging weekend so far and I don’t think our car characteristics are best suited to this track. Obviously, we didn’t get much running in yesterday [due to the wet weather] and today we are just at the wrong end of a very tight midfield. I think we should be stronger tomorrow and we expect the track temperatures to be much higher. Tyre management is going to be important tomorrow and that could give us an opportunity. We just need to look through all the information tonight, work hard on the strategy and see what we can do tomorrow,"</i> Stroll said. </p>
