      <p>The office of Sheikh Ahmed Dalmook Al Maktoum, a member of Dubai's royal family, is also keen on undertaking different power and dredging projects in Bangladesh.</p>

      <p>Hasina will also inaugurate thr NID registration programme for non-resident Bangladeshis living in the UAE at the embassy in Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p>The registration facility is expected to benefit Bangladesh expatriates for whom it is difficult to come to Bangladesh to their NID registration because of time and expenses, the foreign minister said.</p>
