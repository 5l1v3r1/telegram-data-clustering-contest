      <h1>Declan Gallagher admits he was close to tears knowing his family were there for Scotland debut</h1>
      <h2>The Motherwell centre-back put in an impressive performance in the 2-1 win over Cyprus.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:03:01+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Declan Gallagher says he was close to tears knowing his family were there to witness his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> debut.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> centre-back was included in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> 's starting XI in the 2-1 win over Cyprus and put in a good performance for the national side.</p>
      <p>Gallagher's wife Nikki and four-year-old daughter Shay were in attendance, along with both sets of their parents, and the 28-year-old was a proud man.</p>
      <p>He said: "I was absolutely delighted to get my first cap and also get a win away from home. It's amazing and I am delighted for all the boys as well.</p>
      <p>"I knew my family were up the back of the stand and a lot of people watching back home and to stand and to sing your national anthem and play for your country is a dream. It was absolutely amazing.</p>

      <p>"My missus and my wee one were desperate to come over. I think they just wanted a holiday!</p>
      <p>"But they are my biggest fans. My mum and dad were over in Russia and my wife and my wee girl are at every game.</p>
      <p>"And obviously to have my missus' mum and dad there as well was amazing.</p>
      <p>"I said to my missus after the game, I felt like crying knowing that her and my daughter were there to see me get my first cap."</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Gallagher was dominant in the air throughout the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> clash and he was hopes he will keep his place for Tuesday's game against Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>He added: "I'm paid to defend, so it was good to win a few headers and ease myself into the game.</p>
      <p>"I am here to stake my claim and hopefully I have done more than enough to keep my place for Tuesday, but we have a big squad and the gaffer may feel he needs to freshen it up.</p>
      <p>"If that's the case I'll support the boys because we have a good squad of boys and we have to work as a team."</p>
