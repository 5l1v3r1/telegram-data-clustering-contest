      <h3>What to do if your iPhone or iPad won’t charge?</h3>
      <h3>What causes your iPhone / iPad not to charge?</h3>
      <p>Before we move to the solutions, let’s mention a few things that can cause this issue. As we said at the beginning, charging port that is full of dust and dirt, damaged cables and the software can cause this problem. But there are also other things, such as faulty wall outlet or one of the USB ports on your computer is not working. Sometimes, the problem can occur after the device got in touch with water. Some iPhone  and iPad owners notice the error message after trying to charge their device using the charging set which is not Apple-certified. In some cases, iPhone won’t charge after iOS update. We are going to talk about all these things and we are going to list the solutions that worked for many owners.</p>

      <h4>Force restart</h4>
      <p>We have mentioned that a software glitch can cause this problem. Also, if there was a software crash, the software becomes unresponsive which is why your iPhone or iPad won’t charge. You know that any device can behave strangely at times, in which case the restart is the first thing many of us will try. On the other hand, we can be so frustrated when the problem occurs that we often forget the simple things that can do miracles. That is why force restart is something you should start with. It is an easy thing to do and yet very effective.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Press and hold the Sleep/wake button and the Home button at the same time</li>
        <li>Keep holding the buttons at least 10 seconds</li>
        <li>Release the buttons when the Apple logo appears</li>
        <li>Try to charge your iPhone again.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Clean the charging port</h4>
      <p>If you just purchased an iPhoneor iPad, you will hardly face this issue. However, if you are using one of the variants for some period of time, months or years, the charging port can be full of dust and dirt. Many users who reported charging problems for iPhone 5s and those who complained about iPhone 4 problem with charging, solve it by cleaning the charging port. The reason for that is simple. If there are any obstructions, the cable won’t be properly placed into the charging port, thus, the device won’t charge.</p>
      <p>When cleaning the charging port, use a tool such as a toothpick or a small needle. Remove all the obstructions, and once you do that, try charging again.</p>

      <h4>Change the charging method</h4>
      <p>If you have been trying to charge your iPhone using a wall adapter, try another option. Plug the cable into the USB port on your computer. Maybe that will make a difference. If the first method you tried was the computer, switch to the wall adapter.</p>

      <h4>Try another wall outlet and USB port</h4>
      <p>If the previous methods didn’t fix the problem and your iPhone isn’t charging, try another wall outlet. Also, if you have been trying to charge your device by plugging the cable into the USB port on your computer, maybe the port isn’t working right. Try another USB port. You can restart your computer because this will restart the ports as well. One thing to remember – don’t plug the cable into the USB port on your computer keyboard.</p>

      <h4>Turn off the iPhone or iPad and charge it</h4>
      <p>For some reason, this solution worked for quite a few people who faced the issue. Turn your device completely off and then connect it to a power source. Give it a try. To turn off your iPhone:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Press and hold the Sleep/wake button</li>
        <li>“Slide to power off” will appear on the screen</li>
        <li>Drag the slider to shut down your device.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>USB cable</h4>
      <p>Make sure the USB cable isn’t damaged. If you notice the cable is broken or damaged in any way, try another USB cable if you have any. That will fix the problem for you. If you have to buy a new USB cable, don’t worry, these are pretty affordable. When purchasing a cable or charging sets for your iPhone, choose the ones that are certified. Technobezz USB cable</p>

      <p>If you accidentally dropped your device into the water, and even though you can turn it on and it is working, charging issues still can occur. Quite a few owners of iPhone 6 owners reported iPhone 6 won’t charge after getting wet, and this is often the case with other variants.</p>
