      <h1>ESPN Releases Its New Top 25 After Week 12</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:07:36+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Week 12 of the 2019 college football season is in the books. It was an eventful one, with a couple of undefeated teams losing their first games of the season.</p>
      <p>Minnesota lost on the road to Iowa and Baylor lost at home to Oklahoma. The College Football Playoff picture is starting to get a little clearer, though that No. 4 spot is still mostly up for grabs, with LSU, Ohio State and Clemson likely getting the first three spots.</p>
      <p>The new top 25 polls will be out later today.</p>
      <p>Until then, ESPN’s Football Power Index <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/statistics/teamratings">has updated its top 25</a>.</p>
