      <h1>Jalen Hurts Has A Message For Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:33:22+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Jalen Hurts and Tua Tagovailoa haven’t been teammates for almost a year, but the two star quarterbacks continue to share a close bond. Oklahoma’s star QB had a heartfelt message for his former Alabama teammate on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa suffered a season-ending hip injury in Alabama’s blowout win over Mississippi State. He had to be airlifted to the hospital and, while he’s expected to make a full recovery, <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/tua-tagovailoa-issues-statement-about-his-season-ending-injury">he won’t be playing for Alabama again this season. </a></p>
      <p>Hurts, who lost his starting quarterback job to Tagovailoa, reacted to the devastating injury following his team’s comeback win over Baylor.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma’s quarterback said he’s thinking of Tagovailoa and will be praying for his family.</p>
      <p>“It hurt me to hear it. (He’s) a great friend of mine,” <a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeSchroeder/status/1195934082787631104">Hurts said</a>. “I pray for him and his family. I hope everything works out for the best for him.”</p>

      <p>Obviously, the injury to Tagovailoa is devastating. It hurts both Alabama and the sport of college football as a whole. We probably won’t be seeing him play for the Crimson Tide again, as he’s likely to declare for the NFL Draft.</p>
      <p>Here’s to Tua making a full recovery and dominating on an NFL field in 2020.</p>
