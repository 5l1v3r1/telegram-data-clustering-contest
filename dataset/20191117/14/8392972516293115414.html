      <h2>Beauty trend comes with potential health risks</h2>

      <p>Eyelash extensions users are at risk of lash lice infestations, according to a leading optometrist.</p>
      <p>Fans have been warned the popular beauty trend - which involves glueing synthetic or fur eyelashes on top of the natural ones - may have various health risks.</p>
      <p>Dr Sairah Malik told <a href="https://abc7.com/health/doctors-warn-about-dangers-and-spread-of-eyelash-lice/5699244/">ABC7 news</a> that not cleaning eyelash extensions on a regular basis can risk infection... and even lice.</p>
      <p>She said: "Generally the idea when you have eyelash extensions is that people are afraid to kind of touch them or wash them because they're afraid the eyelash will fall out."</p>

      <p>She explained that the lice is called Demodex, which - much like head lice - can jump from human to human.</p>
      <p>Dr Malik continued: "It's an organism that lives on the hair follicles. It can jump on to anyone, it is just like having head lice."</p>
      <aside>They burrow to the base of the lash follicles, and they feed off this material.</aside>
      <p>Demodex symptoms include burning skin sensations and flaky, often red, skin.</p>
      <p>However, she says there is a solution, and recommends a tea tree oil cleanser.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Dr Malik explained: "We recommend tea tree base cleanser. Any cleanser that has a diluted form of tea tree, and it is a good idea to use on a daily basis."</p>
      <p>Eyelash extensions are typically applied individually and can cost upwards of £60 per set.</p>
      <p>They can last up to six weeks, and there is no need for mascara when wearing them.</p>
      <p>Last year a woman told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v1RvtiNJRs">Channel 9</a> in the US how she had suffered burning and inflamed skin around her eyes after having eyelash extensions applied.</p>
      <p>When she visited Dr. Parbhu she was told she was suffering from Demodex.</p>
      <p>Dr Parbhu said: "They burrow to the base of the lash follicles, and they feed off this material. Infection can set in if they overpopulate."</p>
      <p>And apparently non-extension users are still at risk of the lice. Not removing mascara regularly can also encourage lash lice to spread.</p>
