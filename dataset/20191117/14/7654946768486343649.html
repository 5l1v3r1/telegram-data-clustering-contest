      <p><b>Arizona Cardinals (+10¹/₂) over SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS:</b> The 49ers fell as the NFL’s last undefeated team in the 27-24, Monday night thriller to the Seahawks. The public will be all over San Francisco to bounce back, but it’s just as likely to have a letdown (especially on a short week after a grueling overtime loss). So getting double digits with an Arizona team that continues to be competitive looks great to me. The Cardinals’ 7-3 ATS record includes a cover as 10¹/₂-point underdogs in a 28-25 loss against this same San Fran team just over two weeks ago. Kenyan Drake rushed for 110 yards against this vaunted 49ers defense, and Kyler Murray threw two touchdown passes, so I don’t see why they can’t stay within 10 points again.</p>
      <p><b>Cincinnati Bengals (+10¹/₂) at OAKLAND RAIDERS:</b> Cincinnati’s first-time starting quarterback Ryan Finley certainly looked overmatched in the 49-13 loss to the Ravens last Sunday, and the pick-six he threw when they were trailing 20-3 was something he hopefully learns from. But he shouldn’t have the same problems against the Oakland secondary. The Raiders have overachieved at 5-4 SU and 6-3 ATS, but they still shouldn’t be favored by double digits over any NFL team, even the winless Bengals (who have covered at Seattle, Buffalo and the first meeting in Baltimore). Besides, the Raiders haven’t won by more than eight points all season.</p>
      <p><b>Last week:</b> 0-2. Bengals (L). Panthers (L).<br/><b>Season:</b> 8-12.</p>
