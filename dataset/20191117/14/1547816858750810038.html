      <p>It was a night to remember for the young singer, as she recreated the magic of some of her hits including ‘Psycho Saiyaan’, ‘Dilbar’, ‘Leja Re’ and ‘Vaaste’, with the crowd going wild.</p>
      <p>With several chart busters and a huge following of diehard fans, the young and talented artist shared the stage with international sensations Katy Perry and Dua Lipa. Dhvani got to meet the stars and they all had a gala time together. “Before I could say anything she told me that my outfit was amazing &amp; she thought I was really pretty! To which I said her outfit and she herself is awesome! Meeting her was surely the highlight of the evening but performing was the cherry on the cake. I am so grateful for the opportunity and still pinching myself as it’s been a surreal week so far!” said Dhvani on meeting Katy.</p>
