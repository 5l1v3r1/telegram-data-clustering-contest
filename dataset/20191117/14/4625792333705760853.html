      <p>Prince Andrew's publicist quit his job recently after the two faced irreconcilable differences over his recent BBC interview about dead billionaire sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Jason Stein, 28, was hired as <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7693639/The-women-bombshell-Prince-Andrew-interview-happen-Newsnight-producers-convinced-him.html">communications secretary</a> to fight back against the negative publicity Andrew was receiving over his relationship with Epstein, but he quit two weeks prior to the interview with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50446065">Emily Maitlis</a>, which aired on Saturday night. The interview featured Andrew addressing the allegations that he raped Virginia Roberts Giuffre three times. Giuffre, then 17, came forward and accused Epstein of forcing her to have sex with Andrew.</p>
      <p>He has denied and continued to deny those accusations, insisting that on one of the dates of the alleged assaults, he was at a chain pizza restaurant with his daughters. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/prince-andrew-says-he-would-testify-under-oath-in-epstein-case-if-his-lawyers-approve">Andrew</a> also said her account that they met at a nightclub and that he was sweating profusely could not be true because he had a post-combat condition that prevented him from sweating.</p>
      <p>Andrew also flatly denied ever having sex with Giuffre.</p>
      <p>“Without putting too fine a point on it, if you’re a man, it is a positive act to have sex with somebody," he said. "You have to take some sort of positive action. And so therefore if you try to forget, it’s very difficult to try and forget a positive action, and I do not remember anything. I can’t.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-commits-suicide">Epstein was found dead in his cell from an apparent suicide</a> on Aug. 10.</p>
