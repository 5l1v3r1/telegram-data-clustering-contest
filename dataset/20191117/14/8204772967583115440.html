      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jack+Ringrose">Jack Ringrose</a> matched his older brother Garry’s hat-trick heroics with Leinster as he helped UCD to an exciting 30-20 bonus-point win over Terenure College at the Belfield Bowl on Saturday.</p>
      <p>There was plenty of brotherly love where right winger Ringrose chipped in with a trio of well-taken scores, while the Penny siblings, Alex and Scott, played together in the students’ backrow, and Terenure had Stephen and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mark+O%E2%80%99Neill">Mark O’Neill</a> in their backline.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s result means UCD swap places with Terenure in Energia All-Ireland League Division 1A, with Kevin Croke’s in-form youngsters now second overall – four points behind leaders Cork Constitution.</p>
      <p>Lansdowne’s poor form continued and they now lie bottom after Young Munster claimed their first victory of the season – a 7-0 success at headquarters inspired by winger Luke Fitzgerald’s 58th-minute try in the corner.</p>
      <p>Ulster flyer <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Robert+Baloucoune">Robert Baloucoune</a> scored a hat-trick of tries and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Aaron+Cairns">Aaron Cairns</a> kicked a last-gasp match-winning penalty in Ballynahinch’s epic 35-34 bonus-point triumph at Dublin University. Garryowen made it three league wins in-a-row with a second-half penalty try for a collapsed maul steering them past Clontarf on a 13-10 scoreline.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, unbeaten pair Highfield and Old Wesley are out in front in Division 1B. Tim Ryan’s Cork side received a walkover win – and a full five points – after a mumps outbreak in the Navan squad prevented them from playing.</p>
      <p>Hooker <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Ben+Burns">Ben Burns</a> joined the hat-trick club as Wesley’s four-try second-half salvo saw them record an impressive 40-13 win at City of Armagh. Winger Fionn Higgins’s injury-time try earned Naas a maiden league success under new head coach Dan van Zyl as they pipped Shannon 16-14.</p>
      <p>Captain <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Steve+Crosbie">Steve Crosbie</a> scored a try and kicked three conversions as Old Belvedere won 26-21 against Malone to move back up to third, while St Mary’s College also gained ground thanks to a 16-10 victory over Banbridge which saw winger <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Hugo+Conway">Hugo Conway</a> run in a terrific 95-metre try.</p>
