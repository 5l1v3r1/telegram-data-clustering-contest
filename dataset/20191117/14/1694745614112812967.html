      <p>Camila Cabello has dropped <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/camila-cabello-cry-for-me-song-46720086">her fifth single in just a few months</a>, and like <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Camila-Cabello-Shameless-Music-Video-46579714">the love-inspired tracks</a> that came before it, "Living Proof" will leave you swooning. A heady jam that equates finding love to religious salvation, Cabello croons about her intimate relationship with her guardian lover, and honestly, she's really making it hard <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/shawn-mendes-and-camila-cabello-kissing-pictures-46613232">to look at Shawn Mendes the same way</a> ever again.</p>
      <p>"Like a choir singing Hallelujah, when my body's crashin' right into you, When we align," she sings. "Do you feel me? / Can you feel me? / 'Cause I can't breathe."</p>
      <p>Cabello dropped "Living Proof" a few days after announcing her upcoming second album, <b>Romance</b>, which is out on Dec. 6 and already has <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/camila-cabello-album-romance-tour-911633/">a 26-date North American tour</a> set to kick off on July 29. Listen to the latest single above and get ready for the full <b>Romance</b> experience when the album drops on Dec. 6!</p>
