      <p>The Indian smartphone market is very attractive to all manufacturers. If previously, mainly, the low-end to mid-range handsets were launched in this region, now everything has changed. Almost all companies are bringing mid-to-high-end smartphones to India. And though this is a fact, not all of the companies want to fight in higher categories. Say, today, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/11/infinix-s5-lite-india-launch-soon-to-come-with-punch-hole-camera-and-111-price-tag/">following the schedule</a>, the Infinix S5 Lite was officially announced for this market. It costs 7999 Indian rupees ($112). Not that much, agree? It will go on sale on November 22.</p>

      <p>When mentioning a low-price, many think there won’t be any worthy feature to talk about. But the Infinix S5 Lite can boast of a few features. Say, it sports a 6.6-inch punch-hole screen. And though its resolution is not that high, only 1600×720 pixels, not all smartphone makers can afford themselves to come in with such a screen. At the same time, the screen ratio is 90.5% and the aspect ratio is 20:9.</p>
      <p>In terms of photography, the Infinix S5 Lite is packed with a triple-camera on the back. It consists of a 16MP lens, a 2MP lens, and a dedicated low-light sensor. There is a quad-flash as well. Thus, in other words, this phone should be good for taking pictures in low light conditions. By the way, the front-facing camera has a 16MP resolution.</p>
      <p>As for the rest of the features, the phone has dimensions of 164 x 76 x 7.9 mm and weighs 178 g. Under the hood, we can find a MediaTek Helio P22 chipset. It is paired with a 4GB of memory and 64GB of internal storage space. But the latter supports up to 128GB microSD card expansion. The battery capacity is 4000mAh.</p>
