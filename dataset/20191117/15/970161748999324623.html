      <p>Kaia Gerber just surprised her rumoured boyfriend <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/pete-davidson/">Pete Davidson</a> with a personally-delivered birthday cake and if that doesn’t mean they’re official, we don’t know what does.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old model was seen leaving The Magnolia Bakery in NYC over the weekend carrying a huge white paper bag during the day.</p>
      <p>The daughter of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/cindy-crawford/">Cindy Crawford</a> and Rande Gerber kept her beanie-clad head down as she crossed the street in a simple jeans, hoodie and coat daytime look.</p>
      <p>She was then papped entering the NBC studios (where Pete films Saturday Night Live) later that evening in a tiger print top, blue jeans, black boots and long black coat.</p>
      <p>And sure enough, that white paper bag was right by her side.</p>

      <p>It certainly all adds up, considering it was Pete’s 26th birthday yesterday.</p>

      <p>This latest display of affection comes about after Kaia was seen <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/cindy-crawfords-daughter-kaia-gerber-sports-p-letter-necklace-amid-pete-davidson-dating-rumours-11066449/">wearing a necklace with the letter ‘P’ on it</a> earlier this month.</p>
      <p>She attended the Women’s Guild Cedars-Sinai Annual Luncheon at the Beverly Wiltshire Hotel while wearing the necklace in question, just weeks after the pair were <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/24/pete-davidson-sparks-romance-rumours-kaia-gerber-cosy-lunch-date-split-margaret-qualley-10974786/">pictured having a cosy brunch date together</a>.</p>
      <p>Looks like a little romance is certainly blossoming.</p>

      <p>Kaia has fast become one of the hottest models in the industry, and has modelled for the likes of Versace, Chanel, Calvin Klein and Prada, and is also the face of Marc Jabocs’ Daisy perfume.</p>
      <p>Prior to Pete, she had been linked to EastEnders star Patsy Palmer’s son Fenton Markell, and fellow model Wellington Grant.</p>
      <p>Pete famously <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/21/pete-davidson-confirms-ariana-grande-engagement-snl-star-admits-won-life-7648601/">got engaged to Ariana Grande in June 2018</a>, before ending their engagement in October that same year.</p>
      <p>More recently, he was dating <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/03/pete-davidson-appears-confirm-romance-margaret-qualley-lovebirds-hold-hands-venice-10675045/">Once Upon A Time In Hollywood star Margaret Qualley</a> following a two-month romance.</p>
      <p>He was also previously linked to Kate Beckinsale, and although the two had a 20-year age gap, they appeared pretty smitten for the most part, after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/04/pete-davidson-goes-tongues-kate-beckinsale-confirming-romance-rumours-8800314/">touching tongues at a hockey match</a>.</p>
