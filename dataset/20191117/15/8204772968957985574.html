      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Tommy+Fleetwood">Tommy Fleetwood</a> believes it would be “beautiful” to win the Race to Dubai for a second time after putting himself in contention with a surprise victory in the Nedbank Golf Challenge in Sun City.</p>
      <p>The Englishman’s first win since January 2018 came after he beat <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Marcus+Kinhult">Marcus Kinhult</a> at the first extra hole in a play-off at the Gary Player Country Club, earning him a cheque of €2.25 million , the largest on the European Tour.</p>
      <p>Fleetwood is now second in the Race to Dubai standings, behind Austria’s <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Bernd+Wiesberger">Bernd Wiesberger</a>, going into the final event that starts on Thursday, the DP World Tour Championships at the Jumeirah Golf Estates in Dubai.</p>
      <p>After winning the Race to Dubai in 2017, asked about the prospect of triumphing again, Fleetwood said: “It would be beautiful, wouldn’t it. It would be amazing.</p>
      <p>“It’s such a great, great thing and a feeling to be playing with a chance to win the Race to Dubai in the last event.</p>
      <p>“Everybody starts the Tour at the start of the season to get there, so to be one of the guys that can actually finish at the top is very special.”</p>
      <p>Fleetwood went into the final round in Sun City seemingly out of contention as he trailed overnight leader Zander Lombard by six shots on five under.</p>
      <p>But while Fleetwood’s closing 65 included a remarkable three eagles and four birdies, as well as three bogeys, South African Lombard fired a miserable 77 that included a double bogey and four other bogeys, dropping him to six under.</p>
      <p>Wiesberger, who could have won the Race to Dubai a week early with a victory, eventually tied for third on eight under alongside Belgium’s <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Thomas+Detry">Thomas Detry</a> and Australian <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jason+Scrivener">Jason Scrivener</a>.</p>
      <p>A 68 from Kinhult saw him finish level on 12 under with Fleetwood and force the playoff, which Fleetwood won with a par at the 18th, while the Swede bogeyed.</p>
      <p>“Winning honestly wasn’t on the agenda at the start of the day, probably not,” added Fleetwood.</p>
      <p>“It was just about putting a good round together and moving on to next week. But it [winning] feels good. Emotional. It has been a long time coming, and I’m not one to complain, but I really did want to win something.</p>
      <p>“I made a great up and down on one and without that the day could have been completely different. I was also really proud of how I played 17 and 18.</p>
      <p>“I was getting more and more nervous [as the round went on]. Being a golfer these days you have the chance at a young age to set your family up for life – it’s just really cool when you win a tournament.”</p>
      <p>Pádraig Harrington carded a one-under 71 in the final round to finish in 20th position and pick up a cheque for €57,000.</p>
