      <h1>When is the Euro 2020 draw? Date, location and how England's group is decided</h1>
      <h2>England have qualified for the European Championships and already know that regardless of the draw, they will be playing in Group D</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:45:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:45</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Southgate's England side now turn their attention to the Euro 2020 draw.</p>
      <p>England are desperate to rectify the wrongs of 2016, where they were dumped out in the last-16 by Iceland.</p>
      <p>But this time, fans are much more optimistic of success having seen England reach the semi-finals of the World Cup two years ago.</p>
      <p>England have breezed through their qualifying group, with the only hiccup coming in the defeat to the Czech Republic. Otherwise, the Three Lions have been at their prolific best.</p>
      <p>Here’s everything you need to know ahead of the Euro 2020 group stage draw...</p>

      <h3>When is the Euro 2020 draw?</h3>
      <p>The draw will take place on Saturday 30 November.</p>
      <p>It is set to start in Bucharest at 5pm GMT.</p>
      <h3>Which teams are involved?</h3>
      <p>The draw includes the teams that finished in the top two places from the ten qualifying groups plus the eventual four play-off winners.</p>
      <h3>How does the draw work?</h3>
      <p>Each team will be put into a designed pot. There are four pots altogether with six teams in each pot. The pots are ranked 1-4 with the highest seeded teams in pot 1, the next highest in pot 2 and so on...</p>
      <p>However, as there are 12 host nations, each nation that qualifies (or could qualify via the play-offs) is placed in one of the following groups so that they are guaranteed to be at home in at least two group games:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Group A: Italy, Azerbaijan</li>
        <li>Group B: Russia, Denmark</li>
        <li>Group C: Netherlands, Romania</li>
        <li>Group D: England, Scotland</li>
        <li>Group E: Spain, Republic of Ireland</li>
        <li>Group F: Germany, Hungary</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If both teams from each of these groups qualify, another draw will be held to determine which team plays at home.</p>
