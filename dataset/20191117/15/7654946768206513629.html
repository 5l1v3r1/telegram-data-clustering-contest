      <p>A Pennsylvania man confessed to kidnapping then killing his girlfriend in Las Vegas as he carried on a “double life,” according to a report.</p>
      <p>John Chapman, 39, called his wife from the police station Friday about his 33-year-old paramour Jamie Rae Feden, who has been missing since around Sept. 25, <a href="https://www.wpxi.com/news/top-stories/who-is-john-chapman-man-who-told-police-he-left-local-woman-to-die-in-vegas-desert/1009193744">news station WPXI reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“He said he had murdered a woman,” his wife Maureen told the news station. “I was in disbelief.”</p>
      <p>In the phone call, Chapman told his wife that he killed Feden because he “had to,” according to Maureen.</p>
      <p>She said her husband lived a “double life,” taking trips he claimed were for work or to visit relatives.</p>
      <p>“It’s really sick,” Maureen told the station. “I just want the truth as to what happened. I feel I’m owed that.”</p>
      <p>Police said Chapman drove Feden from Pennsylvania’s Bethel Park suburb to Las Vegas, where he zip-tied his girlfriend’s hands and feet to signpost then suffocated her using duct tape, the outlet reported.</p>
      <p>He was charged Friday with kidnapping, obstructing administration of law, and criminal use of a communication facility in her disappearance.</p>
      <p>Chapman hasn’t been charged with murder despite his confession, but authorities said they’re working to identify a body that matches Feden’s description, <a href="https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2019/11/15/john-chapman-kidnapping-charges-bethel-park-woman-disappearance-jamie-feden/">news station KDKA reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“Finding a body, you’re going to have to do your due diligence and make sure it’s the exact person,” Bethel Park Police Chief Timothy O’Connor told the station. “So until we receive actual confirmation that they have found her, you know there’s always a possibility that she’s still alive somewhere out there and we’d like to bring her home.”</p>
