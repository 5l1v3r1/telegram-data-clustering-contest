      <h1>Juventus defender Merih Demiral a transfer target for Arsenal and Man Utd</h1>
      <h2>The two Premier League giants are keen on strengthening their defences in January and see the 21-year-old as a potentially shrewd acquisition</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:30:32+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Juventus centre-back Merih Demiral is interesting both Arsenal and Manchester United, with both clubs keeping tabs on the player ahead of a possible bid in January.</p>
      <p>The Turkish international only joined <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> this summer but has so far made only one appearance in all competitions, with manager Maurizio Sarri clearly not convinced by his abilities.</p>
      <p>Juve paid around £15m to prise Demiral from fellow Serie A side Sassuolo in July, and according to <a href="https://www.football-italia.net/146505/arsenal-man-utd-milan-watch-demiral">Tuttosport</a> they would consider an offer of €40m (£34.25m) for the player.</p>
      <p>Juventus, who currently lead Serie A by one point ahead of Inter Milan, have tended to start with Leonardo Bonucci and Matthijs de Ligt at the back, with Daniele Rugani usually favoured over Demiral as the first back-up choice.</p>

      <p>They also have Georgio Chiellini yet to come back into the fold, with the Italian legend expected to be out until March after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in September, which could see Demiral fall even further down the defensive pecking order.</p>
      <p>Both <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> and United have struggled to keep goals out so far this season, with David Luiz doing little to help shore up a leaky Gunners back-line, while although Harry Maguire has largely impressed for United, they have only kept two clean sheets in the Premier League all season.</p>
      <p>It has been reported that both clubs sent scouts to watch Demiral in action for Turkey during their Euro 2020 qualifiers this week, and he would have impressed as he played the full 90 minutes in his side's 0-0 draw with Iceland, a result which saw Turkey confirm their qualification for next summer's tournament.</p>

      <p>It remains to be seen whether any other teams show an interest in Demiral, with AC Milan reportedly interested over the summer before Juventus signed him.</p>
