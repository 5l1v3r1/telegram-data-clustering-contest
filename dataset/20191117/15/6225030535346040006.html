      <p>Repole Stable's 2-year-old colt Dream Bigger made it two straight stakes victories on Sunday with a sharp win in the $100,000 <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/stakes/Notebook">Notebook Stakes </a><b/>for New York-breds at Aqueduct on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Sent off as the odds-on favorite, Dream Bigger pressed fractions of 22:95 and :46.63 set by Moonachie. Dream Bigger and Jose Ortiz ranged up to the leader on the turn, shook clear of that rival at the top of the stretch and then held off the late charge of Scilly Cay to win by 1 1/4-lengths. Bank on Shea checked in third.</p>
      <p>Trained by Rudy Rodriguez, Dream Bigger completed six furlongs in 1:12.24 and paid $3.70.</p>

      <p>Rodriguez was surprised Dream Bigger didn't make the early lead, but added he expects him to improve off what was his first race in six-plus weeks.</p>
      <p>"The horse on the lead [Moonachie], I didn't expect to see in front," Rodriguez said. "I just told Jose [Ortiz], 'You're on top of the horse, just play it by ear.' I don't think we had him as ready. I think that this race will move him forward. He was carrying a little more weight than I wanted. But he got it done today and we'll take things from here."</p>
      <p>By Mission Impazible, Dream Bigger finished second in his first two starts versus New York-bred maidens, including behind Tiz the Law on debut, before adding blinkers and romping to 10-length victory in the New York Breeders' Futurity at Finger Lakes on Sept. 30 in his most recent start.</p>
      <p>Ortiz noted the blinkers have played a big role in Dream Bigger's improvement and it was on display Sunday.</p>
      <p>"When he made the lead, he kind of played around a bit," Ortiz said. "That's why we put blinkers on him to focus him up a bit more."</p>
      <p>Rodriguez said Dream Bigger remains on target the $500,000 New York Stallion Series Great White Way on Dec.14.</p>
      <p>"Mike [Repole] wanted to go straight to that race but he was doing so well, I told him we should give him a race in between," Rodriguez said. "We didn't necessarily need to win but maybe get him a little tight and I think this race is going to do that for him."</p>
      <p>Repole purchased Dream Bigger for $205,000 at this year's OBS April sale.</p>
