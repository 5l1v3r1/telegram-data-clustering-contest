        <b>Teams from three government institutions have been assigned to probe the findings of reports by Logar’s civil society over alleged sexual abuse of 550 children and youth from six schools in the eastern province.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The teams are from the Ministry of Education, the Afghan parliament and local officials.</p>
      <p>According to local officials, there are 92 schools active in Logar province.</p>
      <p>The allegations, which were publicized by an article in the UK’s Guardian, sparked a mixed reaction among lawmakers from the two houses of the Afghan parliament – the Wolesi Jirga and the Meshrano Jirga.</p>
      <p>Some members of the Meshrano Jirga, the upper house of the parliament, on Sunday called for a thorough probe into the matter, saying perpetrators should be punished if the allegations are confirmed.</p>
      <p>“There should be silence about this matter until the court’s verdict,” said Anarkli Hunaryar, a senator.</p>
      <p>“We can be a better society by unveiling the realities and fighting against negative practices,” said Abdul Rauf Enami, an MP.</p>
      <p>But other legislators indirectly opposed the findings of the research.</p>
      <p>“These allegations are affecting the education sector. I call on media outlets to pay attention to this matter,” said Asif Sediqqi, the deputy speaker of the senate.</p>
      <p>“Making the education infamous means making the whole country infamous,” Senator Akbar Stanikzai said.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Education rejected the findings, saying the teams have been assigned to probe the allegations.</p>
      <p>“We will audit and assess (the findings) and will reveal the reality to the people of Afghanistan,” a spokesperson of the ministry, Nooria Nazhat, said. “We expect the (Logar) Civil Society official to be responsible for what they have said.”</p>
