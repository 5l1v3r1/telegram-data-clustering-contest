      <h1>Deontay Wilder makes Anthony Joshua vs Andy Ruiz Jr rematch prediction</h1>
      <h2>Deontay Wilder has given his verdict on Anthony Joshua's huge rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabia next month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:13:04+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:13</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Deontay Wilder has predicted Anthony Joshua will suffer a second straight defeat at the hands of Andy Ruiz Jr.</p>
      <p>Ruiz Jr stunned the British heavyweight to steal his heavyweight title belts with a shocking knockout win at Madison Square Garden in June.</p>
      <p>The Mexican was unfancied after a late call-up to replace Jarrell Miller in the bout - but WBC king Wilder insists he was not surprised by the outcome.</p>
      <p>And he says he again likes the look of Ruiz in the rematch as he ramped up the pressure on Joshua by reminding him their December 7 rematch in Saudi Arabia is even bigger than their first fight.</p>

      <p>Asked by reporters who he was backing in the rematch, Wilder told reporters (via <a href="https://www.boxingscene.com/wilder-i-liked-ruiz-first-fight-with-joshua-like-him-rematch--144335">BoxingScene</a>): "Andy Ruiz.</p>
      <p>“I liked him in the first fight with Joshua and I like him in the second fight as well.</p>
      <p>“In my opinion, it’s an even more bigger fight between the two, you know. Especially how he won the first time."</p>

      <p>A win for Ruiz could also work in Wilder's favour, providing a much simpler negotiation for a unification bout given they work under the same promoter.</p>
      <p>Wilder, who failed to negotiate a fight with Joshua, said: “With Joshua we tried many, many, many times to get that fight to unfold, to make that dream fight happen for the fans.</p>
      <p>“To unify the division and have one champion. As you can see, that was a long process, a process where, you know, we had different mile markers being stretched.</p>

      <p>"Once we completed (one mark), we had to do something else, do this, do that, you know what I mean. It was a lot.</p>
      <p>“It’s a gladiator’s sport, it’s a man’s sport. I’m a man and I don’t have time for games. Being that Ruiz is under the same stable as I… it’s a much easier fight to make, and in my opinion a much more exciting fight.”</p>
