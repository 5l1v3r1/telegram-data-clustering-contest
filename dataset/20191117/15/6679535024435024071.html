      <p>Harmeet Desai, seeded fourth, defeated seventh seed A. Amalraj 11-9, 9-11, 11-9, 11-9, 10-12, 11-9 in the final of the ITTF Challenge Indonesia Open table tennis championship here on Sunday.</p>
      <p>This is Harmeet’s second international title of the year after the Commonwealth championship in July at Cuttack.</p>
      <p>Harmeet said it felt great to win his first title on foreign soil.</p>
      <p>“It was a very different feeling. It wasn’t a easy tournament for me as I had tough matches from the first round and I beat quite a few good Asian players,” said the 26-year-old.</p>
