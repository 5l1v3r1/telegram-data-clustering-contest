      <p><b>Tyson Foods, Inc.</b> (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSN">TSN</a>) reported fiscal fourth quarter results Tuesday morning which signals an end to prior misfortunes and should ease investor concerns moving forward.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>The Past Is In The Past</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Tyson was forced to recall nearly 12 million pounds of chicken strips in 2019 and unfortunately followed up with a recall of nearly 40,000 pounds of frozen chicken patties. Bad luck rarely strikes in two and the company was dealt another blow when an August fire wiped out part of a beef plant.</p>
      <p>Management was left with no other option but to warn investors it sees short-term challenges in the fiscal fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Fast forward to Tuesday’s fiscal fourth quarter report and there are more reasons to celebrate than be disappointed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>Juicy Beef Division</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Tyson’s beef unit recorded its best GAAP operating margin of 7.0% due to a combination of average sales price increases and strong demand for beef products. In fact, the segment’s operating income improved from $347 million last year to $376 million. Factor in $31 million of net incremental costs from the production facility fire and the company’s most important unit (in terms of sales, and operating income) is performing just fine.</p>

          <b>No Salmonella From Chicken</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Sales in the chicken business expanded 13.1% year-over-year in the fiscal fourth quarter but saw a drop in operating income. Management cited increased operating costs, a challenging pricing environment, and net feed ingredient costs along with mark-to-market derivative losses. Looking forward management guided a rebound in operating margin from 2.6% in the recently reported quarter to 6% to 8% in 2020, without including any impact from ASF.</p>
      <p>Chicken stands to also benefit from an overlooked catalyst: the restaurant chicken sandwich wars. Tyson Foods is a supplier to both Popeyes and Chick-fil-A.</p>
      <blockquote>“Whether Chick-fil-A or Popeyes wins the chicken wars, Tyson will always come out ahead.” - <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/26/when-it-comes-to-chick-fil-a-versus-popeyes-tyson-foods-wins-cramer.html">CNBC's Jim Cramer</a> on "Mad Money" (08/26)</blockquote>

          <b>Prepared Foods Prepped For A Rebound</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Tyson’s Prepared Foods business disappointed investors across a few metrics. For example, volume was down 2.6% year-over-year while operating margins dropped by more than half to 4.8%. But these facts don’t tell the full story.</p>
      <p>The Prepared Foods business saw a volume decrease due to business divestitures which in part helped lift average sales price. Operating income for the full-year was nearly flat despite a $60 million increase in raw material costs and a $41 million hit from a planned divestiture.</p>
      <p>Similarly, management expects the Prepared Foods segment to see an improvement in operating margins to the range of 10% to 12% as additional raw material costs can be passed on to consumers through priece increases.</p>

          <b>Pork Ready To Fatten Up</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Finally, the Pork business was impacted by a combination of increased livestock supplies and export constraints. As such, livestock costs rose faster than sales price -- a trend which shouldn’t happen this time of the year. Tyson Foods CEO Noel White commented on the post earnings conference call, according to the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4305776-tyson-foods-tsn-ceo-noel-white-q4-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single">Seeking Alpha transcript</a> of the call:</p>
      <blockquote>Now, since the product is being produced for export today, we are seeing product prices move higher, as publicly reported, and it’s extremely unusual. It’s counter-seasonal for us as an industry to be processing 2.7 million-plus hogs per week and seeing product move higher, so we are seeing the impact, particularly over the course of the last several weeks.</blockquote>

          <b>Beyond Tyson</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Tyson management said it nearly doubled its retail distribution of its Raised &amp; Rooted nuggets to more than 7,000 stores. The company also has an interesting twist on protein alternative products: a blended burger made with Angus beef and plant protein.</p>
      <p>Without naming any rival products by name (although a clear shot at Beyond Meat), management also said it will only serve products in the alternative category that taste good and represents a healthier alternative.</p>
      <p>Tyson Foods could take meaningful share away from Beyond Meat as consumers slowly realize its plant-based burger replacement is far from a healthy alternative. Don’t take my word for it -- listen to what Whole Foods <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/21/whole-foods-ceo-john-mackey-plant-based-meat-not-good-for-your-health.html">CEO John Mackey told CNBC</a> in an interview:</p>
      <p>“As for health, I will not endorse that, and that is about as big of criticism that I will do in public.”</p>

          <b>The Bottom Line: EPS Growth Almost Assured</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Management guided 2020 earnings growth to come in “at or above” its long-term outlook at a high-single-digit rate. Looking at the final earnings report for fiscal 2019 makes it clear the company has the right pieces in place to satisfy investor appetite.</p>
