        <b>Judd Trump holds a 5-3 lead over Ronnie O'Sullivan after the first session of the Northern Ireland Open final.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Trump was denied a 147 break by a heavy kick in the penultimate frame of the session, and he may well be kicking himself at not having extended his advantage to 6-2 come the end of the final one.</p>

      <p>After O'Sullivan had gone in-off when in the balls, Trump was left with an opening which, had he taken it, would have presented his opponent with a mountain to climb this evening in a race to nine frames.</p>
      <p>But he missed by a wide margin with a rare, stray bullet from range, and that allowed O'Sullivan to keep within touching distance and set up a mouthwatering denouement at 7pm.</p>
      <p>Trump won the first two frames of the final with runs of 68 and 56, before O'Sullivan knocked in a 126 break to halve the deficit.</p>

      <p>The response from Trump was immediate as he made a century break of his own, a 123 which put him back in a two-frame lead in his bid to repeat last year's victory over O'Sullivan in Belfast.</p>
      <p>After the following two frames were shared, Trump's lead became three with an 88 break which might have been a maximum had he not suffered an almighty knick on the 12th red, which rattled across both jaws before being spat back onto the table.</p>
      <p>It was unfortunate, but Trump had nobody but himself to blame for losing the final frame of the session, one O'Sullivan had dominated until an unfortunate in-off the blue put the cue ball in Trump's hand.</p>
      <p>With reds spread across the table, the world champion needed one mid-range red to set-up a golden opportunity, only to produce arguably his worst shot of the weekend so far to had the frame to his opponent.</p>
