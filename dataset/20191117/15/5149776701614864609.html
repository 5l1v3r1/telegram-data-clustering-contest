      <h2>But the figures show something very different</h2>

      <p>Nearly 60 percent of knife-related crime in Nottinghamshire is carried out by white people, new figures reveal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Police and Crime Commissioner</a> Paddy Tipping is hoping to break down barriers in the black community over worries 'young black men' are being stigmatised as knife-carriers despite only making up 13 percent.</p>
      <p>Mr Tipping spoke out at the God's Vineyard Church in Lenton where he met key figures in the black community and called on churches to play their part in the fight.</p>
      <p>He said: "Help us take things forward."</p>
      <p>He also unveiled new funding worth up to £350,000 for local groups to apply for, with initiatives to combat youth violence.</p>
      <p>He said: "There has been mistrust between the black community and the police but we are changing things.</p>
      <p>"People should not stereotype and it is important that young black men are not stigmatised.</p>
      <p>"There is a strong desire in the black community for their young people to achieve."</p>

      <p>He said he was "really anxious" about the way perceptions had been formed, but the figures show young black men make up a small percentage.</p>
      <p>Figures released by Nottinghamshire Police up to September 30 this year paint a picture of the ethnicity of knife crime offenders.</p>
      <p>Out of 334 knife crime offences in Nottinghamshire where charges or community resolutions were made:</p>
      <p>- 197 were white (59 percent)</p>
      <p>- 59 were from black and minority ethnic backgrounds (17.7 percent), 44 of which were black (13 percent).</p>
      <p>- 78 had an unknown ethnicity or their ethnicity was not recorded (23.3 percent).</p>

      <p>Pastor Clive Foster, senior minister from the Pilgrim Church in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">The Meadows</a>, said there is a perception that knife crime is carried out by young black men.</p>
      <p>He said: "We are perceived as perpetrators but we are victims, but that does not get mentioned.</p>
      <p>"What we want to do is help support men and women that are potentially involved and we want to direct them away from it."</p>
      <p>Mr Tipping added: "It takes the whole community to raise a child and it is imperative we intervene early to reduce the risks and prevent further tragedies on our streets.</p>
      <p>"We need passion, unity and sustained effort to nurture the next generation of young people and ensure we put a stop to violence in all its forms. On the street, online and in the home."</p>
