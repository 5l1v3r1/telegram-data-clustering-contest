      <p>Everyone has something that they fear. Whether it is supernatural or something trivial like the fear of mice, any form of phobia will cause the one who suffers from it to experience anxiety, increased heart rate and sometimes even forcing them to do unbelievable things in order to save themselves.</p>

      <p>A good example of phobia was shared on Twitter recently by a user named <a href="https://twitter.com/darwishhh__/status/1195534205909753856?s=19">Darwish</a>. He tweeted a 15-second clip showing a hand, presumably his, holding a dead mouse and teasing his friends in the dorm with it. Two of his friends immediately climbed up a partition that separates their sleeping area with ease while screaming in fear of the mouse.</p>

      <p>Clearly, his friends are suffering from Musophobia, the fear of mice. Or maybe, theyâ€™re just <i>geliÂ </i>at the sight of the mouse.Â Pranks like this are common among those who stay in boarding schools. What better way to have fun than to play with your friendsâ€™ fears, right? These kinds of things will surely be memorable once they graduate and become adults.</p>

      <p>However, when pulling pranks, one needs to consider the dangers involved. First of all, in the video, we can see that the ceiling fan is dangerously close to where they were climbing. Secondly, a mouse is known to carry a lot of diseases and to handle it without wearing a glove can lead to some dangerous consequences.</p>

      <p>Not to be a party pooper, but if you plan to pull a prank on your friends, you need to consider how they will react towards it and the aftermath of the prank. Because a good prank is a well-planned and safe prank. So have fun but remember, please be safe as well.</p>
