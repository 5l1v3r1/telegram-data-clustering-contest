      <h3>Dear Coleen</h3>
      <p>Last year my husband left me for one of my best friends. It’s been a truly awful couple of years for me.</p>
      <p>They were having an affair for a while before I found out. A couple of friends eventually told me they knew it was going on and I confronted him, and he admitted it.</p>
      <p>I was heartbroken and humiliated – a double betrayal. This woman had been a close friend for years – we helped each other out, our kids are friends and our families have been on many holidays together. It’s just awful.</p>
      <p>My husband is now living with her and he sees our kids every other weekend.</p>
      <p>I’m finding it so hard to get over and it doesn’t help that we live in a pretty small community, so everyone knows our business and I’m sick of getting pitying looks from people.</p>
      <p>She was already divorced after her husband had an affair and now she’s done the very same thing to me.</p>
      <p>I was the one who provided a shoulder to cry on when she found out her husband was cheating – she hated the other woman!</p>
      <p>How could she have done the same to me? I’ve only spoken to her once about this – I called her and screamed down the phone – but since then I’ve avoided her.</p>
      <p>Have you any advice?</p>
      <h3>Coleen says</h3>
      <p>I can feel how hurt and angry you are. Yes, it’s a double betrayal, but what’s interesting is that you seem angrier towards your friend and don’t say very much about your husband.</p>
      <p>I get that, especially as you nursed her through her own break-up – you trusted her and she accepted your support and now you have nowhere to put that anger.</p>
      <p>Well, I’d put the anger into counselling where you can vent until the cows come home to someone who’s not involved and won’t judge you or pity you.</p>
      <p>I think your pride has been badly battered. One of the things I hated most after my first marriage ended was people pitying me.</p>
      <p>But, you know, I was able to see it wasn’t really pity, it was just people having empathy and, after what you’ve been through, you deserve having people reach out to you.</p>
      <p>You will get over this and be happy again, even though it doesn’t feel like it now. Surround yourself with good people and let them help you.</p>
      <p>The same thing happened to a good friend of mine whose best friend of 30 years had an affair with her husband. With time and support she has moved on and made a good life for herself.</p>
      <p>She was the one who encouraged me to have counselling when my first husband had an affair, and I resisted it for ages. But when I finally took that step I found it helped more than anything else.</p>
      <p>Some days I’d sit in the room and cry for the whole session, other times I’d get angry and scream, but when I felt really lost and had nothing to cling to, it really helped give me a sense of perspective and logic, which is what got me through. Good luck.</p>
