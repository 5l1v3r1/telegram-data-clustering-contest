      <h1>The Batman Movie Needs to Introduce Dick Grayson &amp; the Bat-Family</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:11:36+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:11</time> by <a rel="author">Anthony Gramuglia</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-batman/"><i>The Batman</i></a> is shaping up quickly to be the biggest film of 2021. Of course, this film also marks the 16th theatrical appearance of the Caped Crusader, counting the film serials, <i>Mask of the Phantasm</i>, and, most recently, <i>Joker</i>. To stand out from the crowd, this Batman film needs to do something different. And by all accounts, director Matt Reeves is doing just that. The film will <a href="https://screenrant.com/batman-movie-cast-every-actor/amp/">feature a gallery of rogues</a> the likes of which have never been assembled in a Batman film.</p>
      <p>But while this mystery filled with iconic villains is bringing the heat against Batman, maybe Bruce Wayne needs a little support this time in the form of his Bat-Family. While it's hard to say a film needs to do anything to be good, it would be a special treat if <i>The Batman</i> re-introduced the core Bat-Family -- but, most importantly, Dick Grayson. Batman cinema has gone for too long without Robin. <i>The Batman</i> should fix that.</p>

      <h3>When We Last Saw Dick and The Bat-Family</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>The films in recent memory have made allusions to Robin over the years. <i>Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice</i> presented Bruce mourning a fallen Robin, presumably murdered by Jared Leto's Joker. In <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i>, we saw Bruce pass the mantle of Batman to a young cop whose real name was "Robin." However, in live-action, we really haven't seen Dick Grayson himself appear since the disastrous <i>Batman &amp; Robin</i>, the film that ended the continuity started by Tim Burton's 1989 blockbuster, <i>Batman</i>.</p>

      <p>That is not to say Dick Grayson hasn't appeared in anything. Obviously, he's appeared in animated theatrical films, such as <i>Teen Titans Go to the Movies</i> and <i>The LEGO Batman Movie</i>. And he is the main character in <i>Titans</i>. But in regards to a mainstream, live-action film, Dick Grayson has been notably absent, despite being such a crucial aspect to the Batman mythos. It has come to the point where, while Robin is iconic, the public has mostly forgotten <i>why</i> Batman needs him.</p>
      <p>Still, this is even worse when you consider Dick Grayson is the only member of the Bat-Family to make a comic-accurate appearance in a mainstream film. The Batgirl we meet in <i>Batman &amp; Robin</i> isn't Barbara Gordon, but rather Alfred's niece. She bears little resemblance to the Barbara we know, beyond the name. Barbara technically appeared in <i>The Dark Knight</i> as a hostage, but her brother (who in the comics becomes a psychopathic killer) plays a more relevant role in the film than the future Batgirl and Oracle. Cassandra Cain, who will be introduced in <i>Birds of Prey</i>, remains the only Batgirl accurately brought to the screen. And forget about Tim Drake, Jason Todd, or Stephanie Brown.</p>
      <h3>Why Does Batman Need Robin?</h3>

      <p>No film has really offered an answer to the question "Why does Batman need Robin?" better than <i>LEGO Batman</i> -- and, oddly enough, <i>Batman v. Superman</i>. Both films present Batman as a loner without real companionship outside of Alfred. However, the positive influence on Batman's life has a powerful impact on the man. With Robin in <i>LEGO Batman</i>, Batman becomes a kinder, more caring person, turning away from the arrogant path he was set down on. Without Batman in <i>Batman v. Superman</i>, Batman becomes cold and cruel, as ruthless and psychopathic as his worst adversaries. Batman needs Dick Grayson and his Bat-Family, or else he will start to descend down a path of madness.</p>

      <p>This is best illustrated in the comics with Tim Drake, who figures out Batman's identity to become his Robin. This sense that Batman needs companions to remain stable and healthy emotionally is rarely explored on screen. Again, the end of <i>Batman v. Superman</i> and <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i> attempt to illustrate this, but both of these films seem more interested in showing how Batman can solve any problem on his own with enough ingenuity. We don't really see a Batman who needs help with a situation to survive.</p>
      <p>This is where Dick Grayson potentially comes in. He can serve as the balance Batman needs to keep his mental health in check. He can be that tether that keeps him from going off the deep end into madness.</p>
      <h3>But Why is Dick Himself Important?</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Still, any number of characters can serve the function of Batman's tether. Catwoman or Alfred, both confirmed to be in the film, can be that personality that helps keep Batman from losing focus on his quest for justice. So what about Dick Grayson is so important?</p>

      <p>Simply put, Dick Grayson himself is an incredible character whose arc really has never been explored on-screen before. Dick Grayson starts off as a boy in need of Batman's help. However, soon it becomes apparent that Batman needs his help just as much as Dick needs it. But as time goes on, he grows into his own hero, moving away from Robin to Nightwing, the leader of the Teen Titans and defender of Bludhaven.</p>
      <p>Nightwing is a fascinating character who deserves his own story. But you can't get to Nightwing without illustrating his past with Batman. This saga can start in <i>The Batman</i>, which can serve as an introduction to Grayson at his lowest. We can see him grow into the hero he will one day become, as well as, potentially, start his very involved and complicated relationship with Barbara Gordon.</p>
      <h3>And Then There's Barbara</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Oracle-Barbera-Gordon.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p><i>Birds of Prey</i> will feature Harley Quinn as the central focus, which is odd considering the team was most famously organized by Oracle. For years, a Batgirl film has been in some stage of production, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/dc-birds-of-prey-batgirl-separate/">with <i>Birds of Prey</i> screenwriter Christina Hobson still working on the script for the solo film</a>.</p>
      <p>This stands to reason that Batgirl, before getting her solo film, might need an introduction to establish her. This might require <i>The Batman</i> to lay the groundwork for the Bat-Family. This would alleviate the pressure the <i>Batgirl</i> film would receive, as it would be a lot to introduce the concept of a Bat-Family and Batgirl all in the same film. Better to lay the foundation out in Matt Reeves's film so that Batgirl's eventual solo film might better concentrate its time focusing on Barbara's development.</p>
      <p>There are a lot of great stories to tell with Batgirl, but the foundation needs to be established first. That foundation is Dick Grayson's story just as much as it is a young, broken Bruce Wayne's.</p>
