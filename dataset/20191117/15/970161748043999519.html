      <p>A terrified mum has revealed how her little boy became ‘lifeless’ minutes after chewing nicotine gum.</p>
      <p>Sophie Balint, 23, is speaking out about the dangerous effects of ‘poisonous’ nicotine products on children after her son Tommy, two, found the gum in a drawer at home.</p>
      <p>Doctors told Sophie that if Tommy had chewed the whole pack, it could have shut his organs down.</p>
      <p>The mother, from Port Talbot in Wales, says the toddler and his older brother Ozzy, four, discovered the nicotine gum while she was helping her mum to redecorate on November 8.</p>
      <p>Within minutes, Sophie saw what had happened and told Tommy to spit it out.</p>
      <p>However, five minutes later the young boy started sweating and vomiting before lying ‘lifeless’ on the floor.</p>
      <p>Sophie said: ‘We were redecorating my mother’s house and the boys went in the bedroom and must have just thought it was chewing gum.</p>

      <p>‘It was in their mouths for a couple of minutes and the next thing Tommy starting crying and saying he had a bad belly.</p>

      <p>‘Within five minutes he started being sick and within about 15 or 20 minutes he was lifeless lying on the floor.</p>
      <p>‘He couldn’t lift his arms and his eyes were rolling. Luckily the next door neighbour was a first aider so he came to help.</p>
      <p>‘He was on the phone to the ambulance and we had to lie him on the sofa flat and keep him awake.’</p>
      <p>Large amounts of nicotine can prove ‘life threatening’ to children, according to the NHS.</p>
      <p>Symptoms of nicotine toxicity overdose or poisoning include vomiting, sweating, drowsiness, shaking, confusion and seizures.</p>
      <p>Sophie, who works in the electroplating industry, says her son was lying on the sofa for two-and-a-half-hours.</p>

      <p>She said: ‘The first aiders were there within 15 minutes but he had to stay there until the ambulance came.</p>
      <p>‘He was like that for around two and a half hours and by the time the ambulance came he had come around.</p>
      <p>‘The doctors said 80% of it had gone by that time. It was only 4mg nicotine so that was quite low.</p>
      <p>‘They said if he had chewed the whole pack, it could have shut his organs down.’</p>
      <p>The mum and son were taken to Morriston Hospital where Tommy was kept for a couple of hours for observation.</p>
      <p>By the time doctors tested the young boy to check his heart and blood, Tommy was ‘back to normal’.</p>

      <p>However, Sophie now wants to warn others of the effects of nicotine on children, saying even the doctor who attended to Tommy was ‘shocked’ by how toxic it was.</p>

      <p>She said: ‘In the house you wouldn’t keep paracetamol in a drawer but there might be chewing gum. People don’t know about this.</p>
      <p>‘It was so scary. He’s normally such a busy boy, he doesn’t stop talking, so to see him lifeless [was terrifying].</p>
      <p>‘All he remembers is being sick and going into the ambulance.</p>
      <p>‘He’s quite big for his age, if he was little and skinny for his age I don’t want to think about what could have happened.</p>
      <p>‘I was hysterical. Ozzy showed us what he had taken, and he was so good trying to keep the baby awake.’</p>
