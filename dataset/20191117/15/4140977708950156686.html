          <p>Ever since winning the first ODI, things have only gone wayward for West Indies after a win which was assumed to be the first stone laid towards reviving their sojourn in the international cricketing fraternity. The side have failed to sin a single match against India in the ensuing five encounters contested between the two in white ball cricket, one which has seen them be pummelled in both the ODI and T20 series.</p>
          <p>Losing all three of the T20 encounters fought between the two units till now, West Indies are now chasing an unassailable deficit when they clash heads against the Indian in the fourth of the five match T20 series come today’s tie. The side have not just gone onto lose those matches but being comprehensively defeated in them with the outfit left clutching at straws courtesy of their unsavoury and derogatory performances.</p>

                <p>Making just 59 runs when the two sides had met most recently, the writing was on the board before West Indies even got to their run chase. They did manage to take India’s travails to 17 overs but the visitors were going to be miffed at peeling down 60 runs, a target they got to with 7 wickets to spare.</p>
                <p>And it’s the same kind of display the Indians will be looking to emulate come today’s encounter between the two sides as they look to make it four wins in succession and further add to the home side’s harsh misery. This match looks to be a foregone conclusion before the first delivery is even sent down, a match where West Indies are set to be nothing more than pushovers. </p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>The track over here the last time around made one thing blatantly clear. This is a track where the spinners will flourish and thrive with a mere 119 runs being scored in 37 overs in the last affair and today’s surface will be no different.</p>
                      <p>With the track set to fully crumble and open up n the second part, the team winning the toss is going to have no qualms in coming out and batting first.</p>

                            <h3>WI-W vs IN-W Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Shemaine Campbelle from West Indies has been our choice in the wicket-keeping docket all around the series and we are not going to be changing that today either. She hasn’t scored runs in her last two outings but the player has always shown patience and application to bide her time out in the middle to make her our pick for this encounter as well.</p>
                            <h3>WI-W vs IN-W Dream11 Batswomen</h3>
                            <p>After winning India their first two matches, the side’s two openers had an off day the last time around but that’s hardly going to act as a determent in restraining us from picking up both of them. Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana have been the top two run getters in this series and they are bound to return to their marauding ways come today to see us keep them in our setup. </p>
                            <p>At a time when they both concurrently failed to deliver the runs, number three bat Jemimah Rodrigues scored 40 runs in the last match to see us pick her up from the side while from West Indies we are getting in Chedean Nation.</p>
                            <h3>WI-W vs IN-W Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Had it not been for Hayley Matthews’ two wickets, the hosts would have been defeated by 10 wickets to see us make the home side’s captain an instant selection for the day. From India meanwhile we have their captain Harmanpreet Kaur come in for us along with Deepti Sharma, the side’s leading wicket taker after returning for 2-12 from the last encounter.</p>
                            <h3>WI-W vs IN-W Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Sending down her four overs and giving away a mere six runs while snaring the two wickets sees Radha Yadav come in instantly from India for us. We are picking up Pooja Vastrakar as well from the side for this one while from West Indies, Afy Fletches will be bringing an end to our side after her 1-17 the last time around alluded to how tough her legspin is to get under.</p>
                            <h3>WI-W vs IN-W Dream11 Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Deepti will yet again retain her place in our side as the captain while Radha is being made our vice-captain for the day.</p>
