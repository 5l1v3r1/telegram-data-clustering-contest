      <h1>NFL Reportedly Planning More Punishment For Browns-Steelers Fight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:15:31+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The NFL reportedly isn’t done issuing punishment to players involved in the Thursday night brawl during the Cleveland Browns-Pittsburgh Steelers game.</p>
      <p>The league decided on suspensions for multiple players, <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/cleveland-browns/how-much-money-myles-garrett-will-lose-during-indefinite-suspension">including an indefinite one for Myles Garrett</a>, on Friday following the game. The NFL reportedly is not done, though.</p>
      <p>Several players appeared to leave the bench areas during the melee. Those players are going to be fined, per ESPN’s Adam Schefter.</p>
      <p>Roughly 10 players could get fined, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28096828/source-nfl-plans-fine-10-players-leaving-bench-area-steelers-browns-brawl">per ESPN</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>League officials still are poring over the video to determine how many players will get fined — the NFL first wanted to discipline the main perpetrators — but it is expected to be a lengthy list, with the fines being doled out next weekend, according to a source.<br/><br/>The NFL’s 2019 fine schedule calls for players who unnecessarily enter the fight area with no active involvement to be fined $3,507 for a first offense and $10,527 for a second offense.</blockquote>
      <p>Rudolph is also expected to be fined:</p>
      <blockquote>Rudolph, who was not suspended for his role in the fight, is expected to be fined. The fine schedule calls for a player to be fined $35,096 for a first-time fighting offense.</blockquote>
      <p>The Myles Garrett incident was one of the ugliest scenes the NFL has had in recent years. It’s not surprising that the league would want to be thorough with its punishments.</p>
      <p>The Browns and Steelers are set to play again on Dec. 1.</p>
