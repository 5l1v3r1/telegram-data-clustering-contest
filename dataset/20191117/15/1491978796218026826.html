      <p>Makeup remover wipes are not only bad for the environment – they can also damage your skin. While they seem like a quick fix, their material can be abrasive and their harsh ingredients often strip the skin of its natural oils, leading to sensitivity and breakouts.</p>
      <p>To remove your makeup properly, you should start with the delicate skin around the eyes. Instead of wipes, saturate three cotton discs with a cleanser specifically designed for the eye area, cutting one pad in half to place under each eye. Don’t try to rub off your mascara straight away. Instead, hold the cotton pads on each eye for 60 seconds to allow the makeup to break down before gently wiping it off.</p>
      <p>When it comes to your skin, the most important thing is to double cleanse. First to remove makeup and impurities from the day, then to clean the pores and to remove excess oils and dead skin cells. Choose a cleanser that suits your skin type for the best results.</p>
      <p>If you opt for a foaming cleanser, rub a pea-sized amount between wet hands and apply to the face using upward circular motions. Wash it off using your hands and tepid water – facial cloths can be abrasive. When using a cream cleanser, rub a 10p-sized amount on to dry or slightly moistened skin. Remove gently with damp cotton pads or splash off with water.</p>
      <p>It’s important to cleanse your entire face, including the creases of the nose, your hairline and neck. Lastly, always ensure you pat the skin dry rather than rub.</p>
