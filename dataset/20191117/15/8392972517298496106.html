      <p>Rochelle Humes won't forget her appearance on today's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/sunday-brunch/">Sunday Brunch</a> in a hurry, after she suffered an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction.</p>
      <p>The former Saturdays singer, 30, was forced to change her outfit during the ad break as a result of busting her zip earlier in the programme.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the incident later in the show, Rochelle told viewers that she'd "breathed out too much".</p>

      <p>At the beginning of the programme, Rochelle was seen wearing an oversized dark denim jacket with a white T-shirt underneath.</p>
      <p>But in the second half, as she prepared a poached egg dish with presenter Simon Rimmer, she was kitted out in a completely different outfit.</p>

      <p>Showing her hands to the camera, she revealed that her palms were covered by the material of her new, stretchy black top.</p>
      <p>The TV fave smiled: "Well, this isn't very good for cooking, is it? I'm all trapped!"</p>
      <p>As fellow guests Susie Wokoma, Chris Kamara and Jason Donovan could be heard laughing in the background, Simon joked: "Poor wardrobe choice."</p>

      <p>And that's when Rochelle confessed what had happened. She explained: "Well, you might've noticed I got changed.</p>
      <p>"I had denim on and I just breathed out a bit much. I popped my zip, so I quickly got changed in the ad break."</p>
      <p>While she was on the show, Rochelle also seemed to scotch rumours that her husband Marvin's pop band JLS are making a comeback.</p>
      <p>And her comments didn't go down well with some of the viewers at home.</p>

      <p>One fan tweeted: "Rochelle just said on Sunday Brunch that the JLS reunion is something that the papers have picked up on, and they don't have intentions of doing a concert. Cheers, son's crying."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "I can't believe I got so excited for JLS coming back, for Rochelle to go on Sunday Brunch and actually crush my dreams. I'm literally crying."</p>
