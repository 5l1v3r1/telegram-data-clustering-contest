      <p>Murphy said, “The president was trying to use the power of his office to influence the upcoming election. He was attempting to get a foreign power to destroy a candidate for office who was running against him in 2020. So this is directly relevant tore the sanctity of American elections. If you don’t stop a president from trying to rig an upcoming election, I don’t know how you live in a democracy. That’s why you had to use this means right now.”</p>
