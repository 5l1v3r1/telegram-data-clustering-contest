      <p>DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco does not plan to market its domestic initial public offering (IPO) in the United States, two sources familiar with the matter said.</p>

        <figcaption><b>Aramco IPO range values oil giant at up to $1.7tn<br/></b>Saudi Aramco is worth up to $1.7 trillion at the IPO price range set by the oil giant on Sunday, below the $2 trillion targeted by Saudi's crown prince but still vying for the title of the world's biggest IPO.</figcaption>

      <p>Aramco had said in its IPO prospectus earlier this month that the offering of shares would rely on the 144A rule of the U.S. Securities Act, which allows a non-U.S. issuer to tap the U.S. market.</p>
      <p>The sources said Aramco will no longer rely on that rule, meaning it will not market the shares in the United States.</p>
      <p>Aramco did not immediately respond to a comment request.</p>
