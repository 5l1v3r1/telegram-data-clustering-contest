      <h1>Rob Gronkowski To Make A Big Announcement On Tuesday: “It’s Gonna Be Wild” (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>The New England Patriots and Rob Gronkowski may have a gentleman’s agreement that nobody knows about, but we all might find out at the same time in just a few short days.</p>
      <p>Rob Gronkowski has made it clear that he has no intentions of returning to the NFL this season after retiring from the game last March, but at the same time, he continues to throw hints that he just might go back on his word.</p>
      <p>Gronkowski said on his Instagram story on Saturday that he has a big announcement to make Tuesday morning at 9:00am EST.</p>
      <blockquote>“I have a big announcement to make. I can’t wait to drop it on all of you. It’s gonna be fun, it’s gonna be wild, it’s gonna be a good time,” Gronkowski said. “Come check out my Instagram page this Tuesday at 9:00am to hear the news. Lets go.”</blockquote>

      <p>The last day for Gronkowski and the Patriots to agree to grant him an official return to the roster would be Saturday, Nov. 30th.</p>
      <p>This announcement could very well be WWE related or even CBD related. One of Gronk’s business endeavors resulted in him teaming up with CBD Medics and creating a line of CBD products to help athletes with recovery.</p>
      <p>We already know how passionate he is for wrestling, but who knows if he truly wants his body to go through even more stress after leaving football.</p>
      <p>The Pats could certainly use him at the TE position, as their current crop have combined for just 18 catches, 242 yards and a TD after 10 weeks.</p>
