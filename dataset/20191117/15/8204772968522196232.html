        <b>Nemo Rangers 2-17 Austin Stacks 0-5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nemo Rangers reached their 19th Munster club football final following a comfortable win over Austin Stacks in front of a crowd of 1,267 at Páirc Uí Rinn on Sunday, with all of their 2-17 tally coming from play.</p>
      <p>The Cork champions played like a team in championship-mode, unlike Stacks, who bowed out in round two in Kerry and looked rusty in most aspects.</p>
      <p>Yet, they started as if they meant business. Shane O’Callaghan forced a fine, diving save from goalkeeper Micheál Aodh Martin for a 45 after just 20 seconds.</p>
      <p>The Kerry side went short and created another opportunity for O’Callaghan, who again tried for goal only to be denied by full back Aidan O’Reilly.</p>
      <p>After that, however, it was all Nemo, who raced 1-9 to 0-2 clear by the interval as the visitors took 16 minutes to register their first score.</p>
      <p>Nemo bossed midfield with Alan O’Donovan and James McDermott dominating in the air, allowing the entire half-back line of Kevin O’Donovan, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Stephen+Cronin">Stephen Cronin</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jack+Horgan">Jack Horgan</a> to claim points.</p>
      <p>Despite accumulating half-a-dozen wides, Nemo still have enough opportunities as Mark Cronin, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Paul+Kerrigan">Paul Kerrigan</a>, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Luke+Connolly">Luke Connolly</a> and captain <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Barry+O%E2%80%99Driscoll">Barry O’Driscoll</a> found the range.</p>
      <p>Stacks, who lost full back Barry Shanahan through injury in the 23rd minute, then conceded a goal three minutes into stoppage time.</p>
      <p>Kerrigan supplied the scoring pass for Kevin O’Donovan to finish coolly with a low shot past goalkeeper Darragh O’Brien.</p>
      <p>The second half resembled a procession with Nemo going through the motions.</p>
      <p>Their second goal came in the 45th minute, when Alan O’Donovan drilled a strong shot low to the corner of the net for 2-13 to 0-3.</p>
