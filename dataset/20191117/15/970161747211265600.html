        <b>Peter Wright has guaranteed a better performance in the Grand Slam of Darts final after a battling victory over Glen Durrant in the semi-finals on Sunday afternoon.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Snakebite secured a 16-11 win over Duzza on Sunday afternoon, but wasn’t at his best as he missed 25 darts at double and averaged 97.34.</p>
      <p>However, it was enough to see off the BDO world champion and book his spot in the final in Wolverhampton for the first time since 2017.</p>
      <p>Wright lost that final to Michael van Gerwen, as he has done in six other major finals, and the Scot may well be taking on the Dutchman again on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>MVG takes on defending champion Gerwyn Price in the second semi-final and has never lost to the Welshman in the PDC.</p>
      <p>Whoever he plays, though, Wright insists he will be playing a lot better than he did against Durrant.</p>

      <p>‘How am I going to lose against Gerwyn Price? Come on I can beat Gerwyn Price, that’s easy. Not really,’ joked Wright on his potential final opponent.</p>
      <p>‘Both guys are fantastic players, you’ve got the reigning champ, and Michael van Gerwen, the number one in the world, who wants his title back. Best of luck to whoever wins, but I won’t be playing like that in the final.’</p>
      <p>Snakebite has not only had problems against Van Gerwen in major finals, but has struggled to get over the line against anyone, losing nine of the 10 he has reached.</p>
      <p>He would love to get some revenge over the world champion and believes he is playing the darts to do so.</p>
      <p>‘I built his house, all the prize money he’s got off me,’ Wright said of MVG.</p>
      <p>‘I’m quite happy with the way the darts are going, obviously not in the semi-final, but obviously I was saving them.’</p>
      <p>Wright’s only major title came at the 2017 UK Open when Van Gerwen wasn’t playing and it was Price who Snakebite beat 11-6 in the final.</p>
