      <h1>Harry Styles' Best Moments On SNL</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:22:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:22</time> by <a rel="author">Erika Harwood</a></address>
      <p>Harry Styles was back at 30 Rock on Saturday night to host <i>Saturday Night Live</i> for the first time, and it did not disappoint. Styles, who was also the musical guest, performed two of his new songs, “Lights Up” and “Watermelon Sugar,” the latter of which he released only hours earlier online.</p>
      <p>During his monologue, Styles threw a little shade at his old bandmate, Zayn Malik, while referring to Niall Horan, Liam Payne, and Louis Tomlinson as his “brothers.”</p>
      <p>“They’re my brothers. Niall, Louis, Liam and…mmm oh, Ringo,” he said, a jab at Zayn for leaving the group back in 2015. Styles recently spoke to Rolling Stone about continuing his friendships with his bandmates after the group disbanded.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, I think so,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/harry-styles-cover-interview-album-871568/">he said</a> about staying friends. “Definitely. Because above all else, we’re the people who went through that. We’re always going to have that, even if we’re not the closest. And the fact is, just because you’re in a band with someone doesn’t mean you have to be best friends. That’s not always how it works. Just because Fleetwood Mac fight, that doesn’t mean they’re not amazing. I think even in the disagreements, there’s always a mutual respect for each other — we did this really cool thing together, and we’ll always have that. It’s too important to me to ever be like, ‘Oh, that’s done.’ But if it happens, it will happen for the right reasons.”</p>
      <p>Twitter, of course, was all about Styles’ appearance on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Unrelated to <i>SNL</i>, but still extremely important, is the sweater vest Styles recently wore while out in New York, which was covered in little sheep. As the Internet was quick to point out, the sweater was reminiscent of one worn by Princess Diana wore back in the 80s during a polo match.</p>
