      <p>The Montreal-based trio, Planet Giza, formed back in 2013. They spent time developing a local following and honing their sound across a string of EPs before releasing <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/planet-gizas-debut-album-added-sugar-features-mick-jenkins-and-kaytranada-new-mixtape.118911.html">their debut album, <i>Added Sugar</i></a>, this year, which boasted a feature from <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/MickJenkins/profile">Mick Jenkins</a> and production from fellow Montrealer, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/kaytranada/profile">Kaytranada</a>. The group is evidently riding the rush of their first full-length release because they're back already with another song, "Insomnia".</p>
      <p>Planet Giza arose out of a merger between The North Virus and Rami B. The North Virus consisted of the producer duo, Dumix and Tony Stone, who decided to establish a permanent group with Rami B after a 45-minute session resulted in the SoundCloud success, "Old School Convertible". Beats have remained a prominent part of the unit's focus, ensuring a strong groove is always present. "Insomnia" shows Planet Giza crafting the kind of ethereal bop that they specialize in. They've carved out a lucrative lane for themselves that could lead far beyond the bounds of Canada.</p>
      <p>Give the track a listen below and let us know what you think.</p>

      <p>I got five rings, she bounce like springs<br/>Going up and down<br/>My hotline bling, is that my ting?<br/>I'm on the way now</p>
