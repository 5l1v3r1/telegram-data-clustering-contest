      <p>Gotabaya Rajapaksa, a former Defence Minister and also the brother of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, on Sunday, won Sri Lanka’s presidential election but lost in almost all of the minority Tamils and Muslim provinces of the island nation.</p>
      <p>Gotabaya Rajapaksa won in most of the Sinhala majority southern districts, according to the results announced by 12 noon.</p>
      <p>However, he lost the Tamil majority civil war-affected Northern Province and the Muslim dominated Eastern Province with a vote percentage of 65 to 70 per cent.</p>
      <p>Rajapaksa was defeated in all of the Northern Province’s five districts — Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mulaitivu, Vavuniya, Mannar — and three districts in the Eastern Province — Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Ampara — almost all affected by the three decade long war.</p>
      <p>The Eastern Province was also the hometown of key ringleaders of the April 21 Easter Sunday suicide bombings which claimed the lives of over 250 persons and injured more than 400 others.</p>
      <p>Gotabaya Rajapakasa received 51.41 per cent vote with 4,940,849 ballots, while his nearest rival, the New Democratic Front (NDF) and UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premsadasa received 42.72 per cent of 4,106,293 voted.</p>
