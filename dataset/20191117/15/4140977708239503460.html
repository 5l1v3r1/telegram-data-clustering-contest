          </p>
          <p>England entered the concluding round of the qualifiers riddled with unsavoury incidents but the 7-0 thumping they handed out to Montenegro helped paper over those cracks for the side. Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez’s brawl and England’s disgruntled showings across the bygone encounters have for the time being been eradicated, something England will be striving to completely put behind them with another meticulous performance today.</p>
          <p>Having assured themselves of a berth in next year’s Euro 2020, England will come hot out of the blocks today, treating their culminating encounter against Kosovo as one where the side will be looking to express themselves freely. The identity of their opponents will further buoy them as they look to pile on the goals in this one as well and wrap up what has been a largely successful campaign for them with aplomb.</p>

                <p>Elsewhere, Kosovo find themselves of the qualification process with the side falling to a 2-1 against Czech Republic, a result which ended up shaping the group. However, the side will not be looking to treat this as an inconsequential clash as they look to lay down a marker today for their future soirees and showcase their skill set and emphasise their ascendancy in the footballing fraternity with a determined and resilient showing today.  </p>

                            <h3>KOS Vs ENG Dream11 Goal-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Where Kosovo has let in the 12 goals, England have gone onto score 33, numbers which point towards only one narrative. This is a clash where the home side are set to concede goals with England persistently banging at their door, one they’ll be blasting open at any point.</p>
                            <p>It’s this magnitude of shots which the side are set to be peppered with which sees us move in for their shot stopper Arijanet Muric for today’s impending clash given the save points he looks likely to garner up.</p>
                            <h3>KOS Vs ENG Dream11 Defenders</h3>
                            <p>England have been guilty of conceding at times but the side managed to keep a cleansheet in their last outing and given the high possession they’ll be rejoicing in today, they might end up making it two shut downs on the bounce. It sees us opt for the two defenders from the unit with CB Harry Maguire coming in while fullback Ben Chilwell offers pristine value after registering the three assists in the previous outing.</p>
                            <p>The singular pick from the other side for us meanwhile with fullback Fidan Aliti picked up given his affinity to keep galloping down the pitch.</p>
                            <h3>KOS Vs ENG Dream11 Midfielders</h3>
                            <p>They came on only as substitutes in England’s last outing but with the side having been assured of qualification, the team are bound to shuffle up their playing 11 for this and give the newer players much needed time out in the middle. It should see them partnership of Mason Mount and James Maddison both featuring for England today, two players who are in exquisite touch at the club level and are bound to bring the same into this upcoming match as well.</p>
                            <p>From Kosovo elsewhere we are bringing in Bersant Celina and Valon Berisha, two players who’ll be handed over a massive accountability of trying to perturb England and catch them unaware at their most vulnerable moments.</p>
                            <h3>KOS Vs ENG Dream11 Strikers</h3>
                            <p>Harry Kane ended up scoring a hattrick for England within the first half itself in the foregone contest to see him cross the 100 goal mark for his country to make the player an instant pick for this one. He’s been in exemplary form for his country, finding it extremely easy to scour past paper thin defences and should add to his tally today as well.</p>
                            <p>Marcus Rashford scored the one last time to see him come in as well along with Raheem Sterling who is bound to be back for this one after being dropped for the previous encounter given his spat with Joe Gomez. </p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Kane retains his place in our unit as the captain with Sterling being made the vice-captain.</p>
