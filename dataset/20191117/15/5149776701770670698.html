      <p>Police raided two homes in Mansfield over concerns of illegal money lending and laundering in the town.</p>
      <p>The two warrants were carried out on Tuesday, November 12.</p>
      <p>Officers seized large quantities of cash, documentation and electronic devices during the searches.</p>
      <p>A 63-year-old woman was taken into custody as part of the operation and later released under investigation pending further enquiries.</p>
      <p>Another woman, aged 66, was voluntarily interviewed as part of enquiries and remains under investigation.</p>
      <p>It was a joint investigation between The England Illegal Money Lending Team (IMLT), Nottinghamshire County Council's Trading Standards and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottinghamshire Police</a>.</p>
      <p>Tony Quigley, head of the illegal money lending team, said: "We are in the early stages of our investigation and enquiries are ongoing.</p>
      <p>"Our advice to residents in need of financial support would be to turn to Nottingham Credit Union rather than a loan shark who could take advantage and charge extortionate interest rates."</p>
      <p>Sergeant Andrew Doran, of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottinghamshire Police</a>, said: "Nottinghamshire Police takes illegal money lending extremely seriously and we will always thoroughly investigate any reports made to us.</p>
      <p>"I would encourage anyone who thinks they have become involved with a loan shark to report their concerns to the police."</p>
