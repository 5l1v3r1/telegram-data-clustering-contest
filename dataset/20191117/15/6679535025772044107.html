      <h1>Euro 2020 | The Netherlands, Germany and Croatia qualify</h1>
      <h2>16 sides now ensured of a spot at the 24-team event</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:42:50+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:42</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>The Netherlands, Germany and World Cup finalists Croatia expanded a list of big hitters to qualify for Euro 2020 on Saturday as the trio booked their places at next summer’s finals.</p>
      <p>Austria also made it through to the multi-host tournament, which kicks off in Rome on June 12, with 16 sides now ensured of a spot at the 24-team event and only four places remaining from the main qualifying route.</p>
      <p>It joins other big names such like world champion France, Spain, Italy and England, with European champion Portugal one win away from qualification.</p>
      <p>Ronald Koeman’s resurgent Dutch needed a point to qualify for their first major tournament since coming third at the 2014 World Cup and got what they needed in a scrappy goalless draw with Northern Ireland in Belfast.</p>
      <p>The draw allowed fierce rival Germany to move top in the group as Toni Kroos hit a brace in a simple 4-0 win over Belarus in Monchengladbach which saw it qualify for the Euros for the 13th time in a row.</p>
      <p>A deft back-heeled goal from defender Matthias Ginter just before the break and impressive finishing by Leon Goretzka and Kroos gave the Germans a comfortable three-goal lead early in the second half.</p>
      <p>A win over Northern Ireland in Frankfurt on Tuesday will guarantee Joachim Low’s new-look side first place.</p>
      <p>Croatia survived a scare to secure its place in the Euros after coming from behind to beat Slovakia 3-1 in Rijeka.</p>
      <p>The World Cup runner-up needed just a point to ensure qualification from Group E.</p>
      <p>That win gives Wales a fighting chance of qualifying after its 2-0 victory over Azerbaijan earlier on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Ryan Giggs’ side stays third thanks to first-half headed goals from Kieffer Moore and Harry Wilson and Slovakia losing against the Croats.</p>
      <p>It is just one point behind second-placed Hungary, which travels to Cardiff on the final day for a winner-takes-all clash.</p>
      <p>Austria booked its place with a 2-1 win over North Macedonia that kept third-placed Slovenia at bay despite its 1-0 triumph over Latvia.</p>
      <p>It is second in Group G behind Poland, which had already qualified going into this round of games but maintained a three-point lead at the top of the group thanks to a 2-1 win at Israel.</p>
      <p><b>The results: Group C:</b> Northern Ireland 0 drew with the Netherlands 0; Germany 4 (Ginter 41, Goretzka 49, Kroos 55, 83) bt Belarus 0.</p>
      <p><b>Group E:</b> Azerbaijan 0 lost to Wales 2 (Moore 10, Wilson 34); Croatia 3 (Vlasic 56, Petkovic 60, Perisic 74) bt Slovakia 1 (Bozenik 32).</p>
