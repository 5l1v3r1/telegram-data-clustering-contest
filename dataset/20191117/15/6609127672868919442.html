      <p>Cops have now made an appeal for any witnesses who can help to come forward.</p>
      <p>They say a number of people would have in the area at the time.</p>
      <p>And they are particularly interested in speaking to a woman wearing a red dress or jumpsuit who may have seen the horror attack.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Phil Wu of the Divisional Alcohol and Violence Reduction Unit, Elgin, said: "From our enquiries so far, we believe that there may have been a group of men in their 20s involved in the assault.</p>
      <p>“A number of people would have been in the area at the time and we are particularly keen on speaking to a woman wearing a red dress or jumpsuit who may have witnessed this assault.</p>
      <p>“If you have any information relating to this incident please contact police on 101 quoting incident number 0504 of 17 November 2019.</p>
      <p>“Or alternatively, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 where information can be passed on anonymously.”</p>
      <p>We told earlier this week how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/4958594/shawlands-stabbing-teenager-glasgow-court/">a teenage thug stabbed another schoolboy</a> after a row about Snapchat messages.</p>
      <p>The 15-year-old boy knifed his 13-year-old victim during a school lunch break in Glasgow’s southside.</p>
      <p>The attacker fled the busy street leaving the injured boy stricken on the ground in March this year.</p>
