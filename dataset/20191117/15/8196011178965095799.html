      <p>Millions of euro of Irish art will change hands in coming weeks, with prices to suit everyone, writes <b>Des O’Sullivan</b>.</p>
      <p>If the number of sales now underway in this season can be taken as a guide then the market for Irish art is in a healthy state at all levels. Over the next few weeks million of euro worth of Irish art will change hands.</p>
      <p>It would be wrong to assume that this market exists only for the very rich. Big sales tend to grab the headlines. However, a small amount of discretionary income and a love or art, or even just a particular piece, can get anyone on board. There are prices to suit every pocket.</p>

Sotheby’s has worked hard to promote its annual Irish sale, which will be the subject of considerable interest in London.</p>
      <p>Charlie Minter, head of Irish art at Sotheby’s, describes this years sale as follows: “The vibrancy of Ireland’s cultural and artistic scene has always been a cause for celebration. This year’s Irish Art sale celebrates both past and present, from legendary figures such as Jack B Yeats, Paul Henry, William Orpen and Louis le Brocquy, to new blood from Ireland’s dynamic contemporary art scene.</p>
      <blockquote>The heart of Irish culture is encapsulated in a diverse selection of works with subjects ranging from literary icons to immediately recognisable landscape motifs, many of them making their auction debut</blockquote>
      <p>Among a strong selection of works by Irish artists at Bonhams sale of Modern British and Irish art in London on Wednesday are works by Paul Henry, William Scott, Rowan Gillespie, Basil Blackshaw, Dan O’Neill and William Crozier.</p>
