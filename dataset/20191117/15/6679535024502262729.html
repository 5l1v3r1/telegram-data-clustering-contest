      <h2>Lack of soil for earth work is one of the reasons</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:07:23+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/A-Shrikumar-532/" target="_blank">A. Shrikumar</a></address>
      <p>DINDIGUL</p>
      <p>The road project, under the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), from Dindigul to Kumily via Theni, has seen stumbling blocks all along ever since it was initiated. The work that started in 2011 has still not been completed even after nearly a decade.</p>
      <p>One of the major reasons cited for the delay is the lack of soil for earth work. The work was left incomplete by the former contractor after which a new contractor had signed agreement in July. The total value of the project is pegged at ₹ 280 crore and includes the balance work for two laning with paved shoulder of Dindigul to Theni section from km 2.7 to 73.4 of NH-45 and Theni to Kumily section of NH-220 from km 215.5 to 273.6.</p>
      <p>Though work to the tune of ₹ 25 crore had been completed in the past one month, there seems to be a delay in the progress due to lack of soil for earth work.</p>
      <p>“The entire work done in the past month is only concrete and structural work, while road laying has not started yet. Since the project completion period is only 18 months from the agreement, the soil issue has to be sorted at the earliest” said an engineer with the construction firm.</p>
      <p>The contractors are said to have applied to the Mines department for soil excavation in a patta land three months ago and the approval is still awaited. Sources said that the approval from State Level Environment Impacts Assessment Authority goes through a long official channel and red tapism has delayed the process and instead local level approvals will be helpful.</p>
      <p>“In other States, approvals for mining soil from dry waterbodies for NHAI work are given at district level. It’s a win-win situation for the villagers and the road work, as waterbodies will be deepened and the bunds strengthened by the road contracts while the soil can also be used for earth work in the construction of the road,” he said.</p>
      <p>The total length of the highway is 133 km of which 80 km is only overlaying of the existing road while the remaining forms the bypass proposed at six places, including Periyakulam, Theni, Chinnamanur, Uthamapalayam, Cumbum and Gudalur.</p>
      <p>So far, bypass has been laid only for Batlagundu and Devadhanapatti. Laying of the bypass is, however, the major chunk of work. The project also includes the ghat section from Lower Camp to Kumily, where culverts for water flow and parapets along the ghats will be newly constructed, said NHAI Project Director M. Muthu Udayar.</p>
      <p>The road is expected to reduce travel time from Dindigul to Kumily and will be of convenience to scores of people from Theni district as they use the Dindigul railway junction to board trains to various destinations.</p>
      <p>It is also expected to be of convenience to tourists from Kerala and Ayyappa devotees who take the route to Sabarimala.</p>
