      <p><b>Breda Graham</b> reveals how she feels less stressed and more refreshed after learning how to control her phone by no longer letting it control her.</p>
      <p>The phone vibrates. Yet another message in the WhatsApp group chat of 10 people that has turned into a two-way conversation between two of said 10 people who refuse to acknowledge how much easier, or less frustrating for the other eight, it would be to take the conversation to a private chat room.</p>
      <p>Its screen then lights up with an Instagram notification. You’ve been tagged in a photo. The three others pictured alongside you look fit for the cover of Vogue while low and behold there you are sporting a quadruple chin and inflamed red cheeks from the sweltering heat of the nightclub.</p>

      <p>You’ll hide that one from your profile though because social media is strictly a highlight reel depicting the best parts of a person’s busy and perfect life. At least that’s what we are led to believe.</p>
      <p>And yet we still become victim to the scrolling thumb because it is a distraction — a place where time and productivity become non-existent.</p>
      <p>As a digital journalist, I spend eight hours at a computer screen each day, five days a week. I take a 30-minute break each day — usually spent checking social media or reading articles on my phone. I go home from a late shift and look forward to unwinding by watching the latest episode of the Netflix series I’m engrossed in — on my laptop.</p>
      <p>In the midst of all of this screen time, I still manage to rack up an additional three hours on average per day on my phone, which breaks down into categories of productivity, social networking and other.</p>
      <p>Productivity meaning time spent on Gmail and Google. In hindsight, not very productive.</p>
      <p>When I began to suffer from bad migraines, I started to question my lifestyle choices.</p>
      <p>Turns out that the migraines were ocular, with some of the factors being stress, anxiety and bright lights. It made perfect sense.</p>
      <p>I realised that I was spending too much time on screens, to the point where my health was affected.</p>

      <p>Speaking to an expert in the field of both personal and business growth in the digital age, CEO Advisor Shane Cradock, helped me to refocus my goals and make sense of my decision-making.</p>
      <p>For Shane, it all started with a book — The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey.</p>
      <p>In his early 20s, Shane found himself in a bad place and had “a breakdown” before working his way through a difficult time.</p>
      <p>Determined to turn things around, he read his first book about personal effectiveness which he was consumed by and began to apply to his own life by teaching small groups and later going on to work with CEOs.</p>

      <p>Shane taught me how to put a stop to “relentless interruptions” by turning off notifications on my phone and prioritising my time using the Pareto principle, or 80/20 rule, which states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.</p>
      <p>He suggested identifying my top three rocks or goals for the day, breaking them into time blocks and writing them down.</p>
      <p>He also suggested taking two minutes out of the day to do four mind ‘stops’ which help clear the mind:</p>
      <p><b>S</b> — Settle your mind.</p>
      <p><b>T</b> — Think about what you’ve already done, what’s going on around you and what needs to get done next.</p>
      <p><b>O</b> — Organise yourself with whatever is relevant.</p>
      <p><b>P</b> — Proceed.</p>
      <p>I decided to take this approach to writing this feature in order to test his suggestions and see if they worked for me.</p>
      <p>By breaking it down into time blocks, I started the day knowing exactly what my goals were and found myself wanting to achieve those goals.</p>
      <p>I visualised my goals as done in my mind and pictured myself unwinding or having a celebratory pint with a friend which made it clear to me what needed to be done in order to revel in that achievement.</p>
      <p>"Coming out of a busy day with no self-achievement is bad for confidence and self-esteem. Instead, come out with your rocks or goals completed," said Shane.</p>
      <p>Discussing the effects that my screen time was having on my wellbeing with Shane made me realise just how easy it really is to become addicted to a phone and feeling that everything revolves around it — an object.</p>
      <p>“Technology is brilliant but if you’re in it all the time, it means you’re in your head all the time, and if you’re in your head all the time, your relationship quality is going to go down, you’re not going to be fully present with people who matter most.</p>
      <p>“Most people wake up in the morning, turn to their side and pick up their phone. They’re straight into the tech world.</p>
      <p>“Never look at emails first thing in the morning, never.</p>
      <blockquote>You’re straight away looking at other people’s agendas and other people’s problems</blockquote>
      <p>- he said.</p>
      <p>Shane said that screens shouldn’t be used as a means to wind down and that they shouldn’t be in the bedroom.</p>
      <p>“Blue light is like an electronic caffeine for your brain so if you’re watching that at night it’s going to affect your sleep,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said that screens should be put away for an hour and a half before bed. This is something I am guilty of — watching a show or scrolling social media until turning over to sleep — but I’ve improved since my chat with Shane and found the urge to check my phone lessened when I kept it away from easy reach.</p>
      <p>I have been waking up earlier without having to snooze four alarms, feeling much more refreshed and recharged.</p>
      <p>“Most people charge their phone more than they charge themselves. You have a recharge strategy for your phone but not for yourself so you’re allowing the phone to become more important than you,” he said.</p>

      <p>If you’ve read this far and realise you’ve succumbed to excessive amounts of screen time, here’s something to remember.</p>
      <p>I control the phone, the phone does not control me.</p>
