      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:50:59+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:50</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Collings</a></address>
      <p>Vicky Pattison has dished out advice for the upcoming <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celebrity</a> contestants.</p>
      <p>The former Geordie Shore star was crowned Queen of the Jungle in the 2015 series after winning over the nation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/vicky-pattison">Vicky,</a> 32, said she's even jealous of the celebs entering camp this year as it was "most amazing thing" she's ever done in her career.</p>
      <p>Writing a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/i-won-im-a-celebrity-but-im-still-jealous-of-this-years-contestants-11163880/">column for Metro</a> , she said: "It’s so hard for me not to feel a teeny bit of jealous of all the people heading into the jungle because, for me, I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here was the most amazing thing I’ve done in my career.</p>
      <p>"If they embrace it, the adventure that this year’s celebs are about to embark on is nothing short of life changing."</p>

      <p>Vicky also revealed that she worked hard to woo the producers as she desperately wanted to be on the show.</p>
      <p>"I have always wanted to go on the show and when they finally agreed to see me at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> I knew this was my moment – I had one chance to impress them and I was not going to waste it.</p>
      <p>"I answered all their questions honestly and openly, we joked around that I was open to the idea of a jungle romance, and that – just like all reasonable humans – I was scared of gin and puppies and definitely didn’t want any trials involving them. </p>
      <p>"At the end of the meeting the producers asked: ‘Is there anything you want to ask us?’  I looked them square in the eyes and said: ‘I don’t want to ask you anything, I just wanted to let you know I’ll be good at this.’"</p>

      <p>Vicky said she wanted to shed her Geordie Shore image and show people the real her.</p>
      <p>"I went into the jungle straight off the back of my time on Geordie Shore and people had only seen that version me.  They saw me as a heavy-drinking, argumentative and controversial young girl – someone who allowed herself to get swept up in that environment and had subsequently lost a sense of herself.</p>
      <p>"I became a caricature of myself and I was keen to put that image behind me and show the nation that there was more to me than slut dropping and Jägerbombs."</p>
      <p>She goes on to say: "But something brilliant happened: I just went in and I was myself – determined, compassionate, kind, resilient, strong, up for a laugh and a real team player – and within 24 hours I was the favourite to win."</p>

      <p>Vicky also says meeting Ant and Dec was a dream come true and they were "fun, friendly, supportive" and "bloody lovely".</p>
      <p>When giving her advice, Vicky said: "My advice to this year’s camp mates would be to relax and enjoy it. Feel the gravity of what you’re actually doing and be grateful for the experience – because all too quickly it will be over and you’ll be back at home watching it on the sofa, feeling more than a tinge of jealousy (like me!)</p>
      <p>"Right, here it goes: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Do not be a f***y in the trials. You can scream, you can shout, you can whinge all you want – but get it done. There are hungry people back at camp and nothing sours a mood more than returning empty-handed to a waiting crowd of ex-professional footballers and girl band members – they get HANGRY. </li>
        <li>"Help out in camp. You literally are left to your own devices within the camp. There aren’t any crew members who pop in with bacon and eggs and fresh knickers when the cameras aren’t rolling. It’s a real life jungle and there’s a lot to be done – so pitch in. Collect water, empty the dunny, volunteer to do the washing – just be present and a team player. No one likes a work-shy princess in camp. </li>
        <li>"And finally, try not to sleep through the day. Days can be long in camp and at times – if you aren’t doing a trial or a dingo dollar – a little bit boring. But honestly, no one likes watching people sleep – it’s weird. Remember you’re there to entertain. So do it!"</li>
      </ul>
