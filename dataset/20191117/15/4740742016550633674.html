      <h1>Removal firm hits customer with '£2,500 bill for four mile house move'</h1>
      <h2>Bristol 1st Removals Ltd says they were within their rights to charge the storage fee after keys to the new home came late</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:17:23+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:17</time> by <a rel="author">Geoffrey Bennett</a></address>
      <p>A customer of a Bedmister-based removals firm says he ended up paying £2,500 - to move just four miles.</p>
      <p>Kevin White told <i>Bristol Live</i> he was quoted £660, from Bristol 1st Removals Ltd, to move house from Ilchester Crescent in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bedminster">Bedminster</a> Down to Chessington Avenue in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/whitchurch">Whitchurch</a>.</p>
      <p>But on the day of the move he got his new house keys late.</p>
      <p>He said that as a result the firm told him they would have to store his things overnight, at an extra cost of £1,920, before completing the move the next day.</p>
      <p>But Richard Morgan, of Bristol 1st Removals Ltd, told <i>Bristol Live</i> under terms and conditions the company legitimately charged the extra money and acted within their rights.</p>
      <p>And he said Mr White was "bang out of order" in threatening company staff, which contributed to him not meeting with the dissatisfied customer.</p>
      <p>Mr White, 51, a driver, booked the company to move he and his wife Allison on Friday, October 18.</p>
      <p>He said: "At 11 o'clock our solicitor phoned and said the guy buying our house had a delay with the money.</p>
      <p>"We phoned the removal men and they phoned up their boss."</p>
      <p>Mr White said Mr Morgan rang from the company and told him that, under the terms and conditions, there was a cut-off time of 3pm for moving and if the keys weren't available possessions would have to be stored overnight.</p>
      <h3>'Obviously we were angry'</h3>
      <p>Mr White said: "I was told to pay £1,920 on top of the £660 and if I didn't pay it I wouldn't get my stuff back.</p>
      <p>"I paid the £1,920, which came to a total of £2,500 to move four miles."</p>
      <p>Mr White said he had the keys to his new home by 4pm, but by then it was too late.</p>
      <p>He and his wife stayed the night at their son's home in Bedminster Down before the move was completed the next day.</p>
      <p>He said: "Obviously we were angry.</p>

      <p>"We chatted to them a week after and there was a heated discussion and I threatened to call police."</p>
      <p>Mr Morgan told <i>Bristol Live</i>: "He got his keys late, we have terms and conditions and we reserved the right to charge more money."</p>
      <p>He saide he had not met with the customer since as he (Mr Morgan) had been ill, and had not appreciated him threatening his staff.</p>
      <p>But he said he would speak to Mr White if he wanted to see him.</p>
      <p>He added the company is a member of The National Guild of Removers and Storers Ltd and Mr White would be able to take any complaint to the Removals Ombudsman.</p>
      <p>In September, <i>Bristol Live</i> reported how Bristol 1st Removals customer Gina Davis said the company damaged her cherished possessions in a house move.</p>
      <p>The firm said it would offer Ms Davis £500 in compensation in an act of goodwill for damage to a chest and mirror, as well as repairing a jewellery box.</p>
