      <h2>The Monarch - who is understood to have given Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, the go-ahead for the BBC Newsnight interview at Buckingham Palace - looked downcast after attending a church service in Windsor</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:58:03+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:58</time> by <a rel="author">Amber Hicks, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>The Queen failed to raise a smile this morning as she made her first public appearance since son Prince Andrew's astonishing BBC interview.</p>
      <p>The 93-year-old monarch was photographed in the back of a chauffeur driven car as she made her way back to Windsor after attending a Sunday church service.</p>
      <p>The usually smiley great-grandmother appeared stern and tense while dressed in an eye-catching turquoise hat and colour-coordinated jacket.</p>
      <p>In one photo she can be seen turning away from the camera with her face not visible.</p>
      <p>Last night, millions tuned in to watch her son Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, be grilled by Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis over allegations he slept with an underage girl.</p>

      <p>The esteemed journalist also quizzed the 59-year-old about his friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, 66, who was found hanged in a jail cell in the summer while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>The duke's TV appearance has been branded a "car-crash", "disastrous" and "like watching a man in quicksand".</p>
      <p>It is understood the Queen gave the go-ahead for the filming at the Palace, but did not see any clips prior to it being broadcast.</p>
      <p>Former Buckingham Palace press officer Dickie Arbiter described the interview as "excruciating" and said the duke has "done himself no favours".</p>

      <p>He said: "If Prince Andrew thinks he's drawn a line in the sand over the Epstein saga he's in cuckoo land. Whomever advised he did this interview ought to collect his/her P45."</p>
      <p>Mr Arbiter added to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50450207">BBC</a>: "They will be wondering: was this the right decision? Was the right decision made? Who made the decision to put him on? Did he make it himself or did he seek advice within the palace?</p>
      <p>"My guess is that he bulldozed his way in and decided he was going to do it himself without any advice.</p>
      <p>"Any sensible-thinking person in the PR business would have thrown their hands up in horror at the very suggestion that he puts himself up in front of a television camera to explain away his actions and his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein."</p>

      <p>As we <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrews-media-advisor-quit-20899110">reported earlier</a>, one of  Andrew's media advisors reportedly quit several weeks ago after 'warning him' not to go ahead with the Newsnight filming.</p>
      <p>Spin doctor Jason Stein is said to have been hired in September to revive Andrew's reputation following public backlash to his links with paedophile Epstein.</p>
      <p>However, Mr Stein reportedly left his role at the palace after four weeks 'by mutual consent' having advised the duke the interview could backfire, according to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/prince-andrews-pr-man-quit-after-advising-against-interview-gvc59hmql">The Sunday Times.</a></p>
      <p>The 28-year-old, who was previously an advisor to MP Amber Rudd, also reportedly clashed with Andrew's private secretary, Amanda Thirsk, who it is claimed was 'pushing hard' for the duke to do the TV appearance.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Mr Stein instead suggested enhancing the duke's public image by doing two newspaper interviews to mark his 60th birthday in February.</p>
      <p>But Andrew went ahead with the interview 'out of a sense of frustration'.</p>
      <p>Even some of those broadly in favour of the royal family, such as Royal Central website editor Charlie Proctor, were not impressed.</p>
      <p>"I expected a train wreck. That was a plane crashing into an oil tanker, causing a tsunami, triggering a nuclear explosion level bad," Mr Proctor tweeted.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>When asked if the Epstein allegations had been "damaging" to his mother, the Queen, and the rest of the Royal Family, Andrew said: "I don't believe it's been damaging to the Queen at all, it has to me and it's been a constant drip if you see what I mean in the background that people want to know."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, PR and crisis consultant Mark Borkowski said it was a lesson on "how not to do" public relations.</p>
      <p>"I have never seen anything so disastrous. For any students of PR, that is how not to do it," he said.</p>
      <p>"It was like watching a man in quicksand and unfortunately, I don't think anyone would have thrown him a line to get him out."</p>
      <p>Mr Borkowski said he would not have advised Andrew to do the interview, adding that his comments on the show will "haunt him" in the future.</p>

      <p>"I feel sorry for a lot of charities that got on well him," Mr Borkowski said. "He [Andrew] has done remarkable work for charity, but whether or not he can be an ambassador again after that...</p>
      <p>"This really does park the bus across his ability to do the work many people have benefited from."</p>
      <p>Epstein previously admitted prostituting minors in 2008 and spent 18 months in prison after agreeing a plea bargain.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Andrew was dragged into the scandal when one of Epstein's victims said she had been forced to have sex with him when she was just 17.</p>
      <p>Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegations by accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre.</p>
      <p>The now 36-year-old mum of three, alleged Andrew had sex with her three times, the first occasion she claims happened in 2001 in London.</p>
      <p>During the 50-minute BBC interview Andrew insisted: “We never had any sort of sexual contact whatever” and he has "no recollection" of ever meeting her.</p>
