      <p>Table tennis is pitched as a great way for older people to stay ­active – and when I first heard this I thought it was a strange choice. Why is it so beneficial?</p>
      <p>The reason scientists gave was that table tennis required constant ­strategising, so it was good for the brain as well as the body.</p>
      <p>New research bears this out, replacing table tennis with badminton, a sport equally challenging for the brain and the body.</p>
      <p>A group of 20 participants were asked to take a cognitive test before and after doing various forms of ­exercise.</p>
      <p>Researchers found cognitive performance was boosted after ­participants played badminton – but not running on a treadmill – because a player has to make decisions and use co-ordination which has positive effects on the brain and can help prevent disease such as dementia.</p>
      <p>The study investigated whether a single session of exercise could ­stimulate the part of the brain called the executive centre, which controls your attention span, organising and planning, initiates tasks, regulates emotions and exercises self-control.</p>

      <p>The team, led by Shinji Takahashi at Tohoku Gakuin University in Japan, made participants complete a test of matching words to colours before and after each exercise session.</p>
      <p>The average scores increased from 53.6 to 57.1 after playing badminton. But after running the scores only rose from 55.0 to 57.2.</p>
      <p>The authors said: “In badminton, players are required to not only grasp the speed and orbit of the shuttle and spatial position of the opponent, but also to choose appropriate shots and perform them.</p>
      <p>“Such cognitive demands could ­activate the regions of the brain concerned with executive functions.</p>
      <p>"We conclude that the large effect of the badminton intervention on ­executive function was due to the cognitive demands required to play the game.” This means the brain has a large part to play in keeping pace with an opponent.</p>
      <p>The researchers were investigating a part of our executive function called inhibitory function, which we acquire in early childhood and which controls our impulses, helps us to delay pleasure and to plan for the future.</p>
      <p>"Poor inhibitory function, or self-control, may stop a child from concentrating and focusing in class, causing them to interrupt and be disruptive out of boredom.</p>
      <p>The researchers said their main finding was that badminton increased performance of inhibitory function of the brain’s executive centre “over and above” the effect that could be achieved by running.</p>
