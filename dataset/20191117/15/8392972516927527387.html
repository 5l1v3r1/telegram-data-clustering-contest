      <h1>Piers Morgan rips into Prince Andrew for "desperate, toe curling" interview about friendship with paedophile</h1>
      <h2>"Why on earth did he do this? Insane," Piers wondered</h2>

      <p>TV host <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/">Piers Morgan</a> has slammed <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-andrew-let-side-down-over-friendship-with-paedophile/">Prince Andrew</a>'s performance in Saturday night's interview about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein as "desperate".</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a> host admitted to being flabbergasted by the Newsnight conversation between the Duke of York and journalist Emily Maitlis -  but pulled no punches when assessing the royal.</p>
      <p>"This is one of the most astonishing interviews I’ve ever watched," he tweeted to his 6.9 million followers yesterday evening.</p>
      <p>And while former newspaper editor Piers had plenty of praise for the steely grilling exhibited by the Newsnight presenter, it appears he was less than impressed by the Prince.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Piers continued: "Brilliant forensic dissection by @maitlis - desperate, toe-curling [bleep] from Prince Andrew."</p>
      <p>He also questioned why the eighth in line to the throne would agree to be quizzed over his association with the late billionaire sex offender who took his own life in August.</p>
      <p>"Why on earth did he do this? Insane," Piers added.</p>
      <p>Later adding he felt the programme contained "excruciating" elements, Piers also seemed riled when Prince Andrew made reference to Epstein becoming almost "a mental health issue" for him.</p>

      <p>"OF COURSE!" Piers blasted.</p>
      <p>"Took him 50 minutes but he got to the modern day catch-all defence in the end."</p>
      <p>During the interview, Prince Andrew, 59, claimed <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-andrew-let-side-down-over-friendship-with-paedophile/">he did not recall meeting Virginia Giuffre</a>. She has accused him of having sex with her when she was 17.</p>
      <p>The Prince also said he could not have been with her at a London nightclub on March 10, 2001, as he had been at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking, Surrey that evening.</p>

      <p>Quizzed about claims they had danced at the club - and that she recalled how sweaty he was - Andrew replied: "I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don't sweat or I didn't sweat at the time."</p>
      <p>He went on to add this unusual condition was linked to him being shot at during the Falklands War.</p>
      <p>The royal said: "I didn't sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at.</p>

      <p>"It was almost impossible for me to sweat."</p>
      <p>Sources have suggested the grilling came after months of negotiations, with the Queen giving her blessing for <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/the-queens-favourite-son-revealed-and-its-not-who-you-think/">her 'favourite son'</a> to do it.</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace previously called the allegations "false and without any foundation" and said "any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors" by the duke was "categorically untrue".</p>
