      <p><b>Matchup: <a href="https://www.nhl.com/sabres/stats/">Buffalo Sabres</a></b> (10-6-3) vs. <a href="https://www.nhl.com/blackhawks/stats"><b>Chicago Blackhawks </b></a>(8-7-4)<br/><b>Where</b>: United Center<br/><b>When:</b> 7 p.m.<br/><b>TV:</b> MSG<br/><b>Radio:</b> WGR 550</p>
      <p><b>Thompson’s time:</b> The Sabres recalled winger Tage Thompson from Rochester on Sunday morning, indicating they will likely be without Kyle Okposo against the Blackhawks.</p>
      <p>Okposo suffered an undisclosed injury during the second period of the Sabres’ 4-2 win over the Ottawa Senators on Saturday night. Coach Ralph Krueger called Okposo’s status a “day-to-day situation” and told the media the team planned to evaluate the winger Sunday.</p>
      <p>Thompson, who was acquired from St. Louis in the Ryan O’Reilly trade, had an outstanding preseason before being sent to the Amerks near the end of training camp. The 22-year-old had six goals among 12 points in 16 games with Rochester, showing improved play without the puck and an ability to use his size to make an impact around the net.</p>
      <p>Thompson is the third Amerks player to join the Sabres this week, following Rasmus Asplund and Curtis Lazar. Buffalo has been without Johan Larsson (upper body), Marcus Johansson (upper body) and Vladimir Sobotka (lower body).</p>

      <p><b>Hutton in goal:</b> Carter Hutton is set to start in goal for the Sabres in the second game of a back-to-back. Hutton has struggled since his back-to-back shutouts last month, posting a 0-3 record with a 3.80 goals-against average and a .880 save percentage over his last five starts.</p>
      <p>Hutton has stopped 139 of 158 shots against, though it’s important to note the Sabres’ defensive-zone coverage has been porous at times.</p>
      <p>The rest of the Sabres’ lineup will not be revealed until Krueger speaks to the media at 4:30 p.m., Eastern. Here is how they lined up Saturday against Ottawa, though Okposo is unlikely to play against the Blackhawks:</p>

      <p><b>Windy City:</b> The Sabres have are 1-10-4 in their last 15 games against the Blackhawks dating back to January 2010. Buffalo’s only win during that span occurred on March 17, 2018. Prior to those 15 games, the Sabres went 8-3-1 (tie) dating back to the start of the 1999-2000 season.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the Sabres are 0-6-3 at United Center since a 2-1 win on Jan. 10, 2007, meaning they have not beaten the Blackhawks in Chicago since Patrick Kane was drafted first overall. Buffalo is 0-0-3 in its last three visits.</p>
      <p><b>Dahlin sits:</b> Rasmus Dahlin was benched for the third period Saturday night against the Ottawa Senators, the second time this season Krueger chose to sit the 19-year-old defenseman late in a close game. Dahlin has played in each of a possible 101 regular-season games since being drafted first overall by the Sabres in 2018.</p>
      <p>John Gilmour and Colin Miller have been healthy scratches as of late.</p>
      <p>Familiar face: This will be the Sabres' first game against Alex Nylander, whom they traded to Chicago in July for defenseman Henri Jokiharju. Nylander, 21, has four goals among nine points in 18 games for the Blackhawks this season. He was drafted eighth overall by the Sabres in 2016.</p>
      <p>Nylander scored two goals in the third period of the Blackhawks' 7-2 win over Nashville on Saturday night.</p>
