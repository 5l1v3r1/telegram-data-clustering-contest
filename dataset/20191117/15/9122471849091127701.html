      <h1>ESPN’s College Football Playoff Picks After Week 12</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:55:29+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>ESPN’s college football analysts have updated their picks for the College Football Playoff following Week 12 of the regular season.</p>
      <p>Week 12 saw a couple of undefeated teams suffer their first losses, with both Minnesota and Baylor going down to Iowa and Oklahoma, respectively.</p>
      <p>The College Football Playoff picture is thus getting clearer. Baylor is likely eliminated from contention, despite just having one loss, and Minnesota will need to win out to have a chance.</p>
      <p>Georgia, meanwhile, has seen its stock go up following a win against Auburn.</p>
      <p>Here are <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/page/Playoffpredictions191116/college-football-playoff-picks-week-12">the latest picks from ESPN</a>:</p>
      <blockquote><b>Andrea Adelson: </b>1. LSU; 2. Clemson; 3. Ohio State; 4. Georgia<br/><b>Edward Aschoff: </b>1. LSU; 2. Ohio State; 3. Clemson; 4. Georgia<br/><b>Kyle Bonagura: </b>1. LSU; 2. Ohio State; 3. Clemson; 4. Utah<br/><b>Bill Connelly: </b>1. Ohio State; 2. LSU; 3. Clemson; 4. Georgia<br/><b>Heather Dinich: </b>1. LSU; 2. Ohio State; 3. Clemson; 4.

Ohio State; 3. Clemson; 4. Georgia<br/><b>Alex Scarborough</b>: 1. LSU; 2. Ohio State; 3. Clemson; 4. Georgia<br/><b>Mark Schlabach:</b> 1. Clemson; 2. LSU; 3. Ohio State; 4. Oregon<br/><b>Tom VanHaaren: </b>1. LSU; 2. Ohio State; 3. Clemson; 4. Oregon</blockquote>
      <p>As you can see, there’s a clear top three in LSU, Ohio State and Clemson. It’s the No. 4 spot where the analysts are differing.</p>
      <p>Georgia, Oregon and Utah are all getting picks right now.</p>
      <p>The new College Football Playoff rankings will be out on Tuesday night. Georgia is likely to hold onto the No. 4 spot for now.</p>
