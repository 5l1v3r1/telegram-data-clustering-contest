      <h1>Man United fans fume at Gareth Southgate as Chelsea's Callum Hudson-Odoi starts against Kosovo</h1>
      <h2>The Chelsea winger makes his second start for England</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:49:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:49</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Callum Hudson-Odoi has been named in England's starting line-up for their Euro 2020 qualifier against Kosovo.</p>
      <p>The Chelsea winger was an unused substitute during Thursday's 7-0 thrashing of Montenegro, a result which sealed England's place at the European Championship next summer.</p>
      <p>But Southgate has handed a start to the teenager as well as recalling Raheem Sterling after dropping the Manchester City winger for his role in the training ground bust-up with Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>Nick Pope also starts over Jordan Pickford, with Southgate wanting to hand the Burnley goalkeeper some crucial international experience.</p>
      <p>Southgate says he is delighted to be blessed with a group of young, hungry players - many of whom ply their trade for Chelsea.</p>
      <p>“But I would imagine that Sven thought the same of Beckham, Scholes, Carrick, Gerrard, Lampard,” Southgate says. “If you’re the England manager, you’re normally in a reasonably privileged position. We have given young players their opportunity ahead of their time, which has given us a greater depth.</p>
      <p>“There’s nothing better than seeing the smile on Tammy Abraham’s face when he gets his first goal for England [on Thursday]. That almost makes everything worthwhile.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea fans took to social media before the game, with many delighted that Hudson-Odoi will get his chance against Kosovo, but also slightly disappointed that Abraham is again on the bench.</p>
      <p>Some Manchester United supporters questioned why Marcus Rashford was dropped after his goal against Montenegro.</p>
      <p><b>England XI v Kosovo:</b> Pope, Alexander-Arnold, Chilwell, Rice, Maguire, Mings, Sterling, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Kane, Winks, Hudson-Odoi.</p>
      <p><b>Substitutes:</b> Pickford, Henderson, Trippier, Rose, Stones, Tomori, Maddison, Mount, Sancho, Rashford, Wilson, Abraham.</p>
