      <h1>Star Wars: Ousted Rise of Skywalker Director Gets Writing Credit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:11:40+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:11</time> by <a rel="author">Samuel Gelman</a></address>
      <p>The Writers Guild of America (WGA) has finally decided on the writing credits for <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix/"><i>The Rise of Skywalker</i></a>, with one name on the list coming as a bit of a surprise.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://collider.com/who-wrote-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker/"><i>Collider</i></a>, the film will have a "Story by Derek Connolly &amp; Colin Trevorrow and Chris Terrio &amp; J. J. Abrams” credit. Trevorrow was originally set to co-write and direct <i>The Rise of Skywalker </i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-episode-ix-colin-trevorrow-exit/">before being ousted</a> in favor of J.J. Abrams. This seemingly indicates that some of the storylines that Trevorrow had in mind made it into the finished product.</p>
