      <p><b>Hyderabad</b>: "Brain is not a part of you. It plays games with you. Sometimes it can be your worst enemy. You have to constantly come back to your brain. I always monitor what I give to my brain," said popular actress Rekha. <br/><br/>She was here to receive the prestigious ANR (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) national award for 2019 at a glittering function at Annapurna Studios. Megastar Chiranjeevi presented the award. <br/><br/>The award for 2018 was announced for Late Sridevi, which was received by her husband Boney Kapoor. <br/><br/><br/>Recalling her association with ANR, Rekha said he preached her on how to be careful about giving food to the brain. "ANR told me that we give food to our bodies as it serves physical stamina. You should walk, dance, swim and do many things. But, you should give food to your brain as it serves your soul. This preaching of the legendary actor remained in my mind eternally. My father also told me that doctor saves lives and actor saves souls. Hence I always monitor the food I give to my body and brain," she said preaching the younger generation to be watchful of what they feed their brains. <br/><br/>Rekha, who began her career in Tollywood as a child artist as a one year old (Rangula Ratnam), expressed her desire to act in Telugu film again. "When I was passing through the lull period in Mumbai in the early '80s, I was called to Hyderabad. I shot back and stayed here for ten years. I will come again to fulfill my mother's last wish to act in Telugu, my mother tongue," she announced amid applause from the audience. <br/><br/><br/>Chiranjeevi, Akkineni Nagarjuna, T Subbirami Reddy and Amala Akkineni were other celebrities who spoke at the event.</p>
