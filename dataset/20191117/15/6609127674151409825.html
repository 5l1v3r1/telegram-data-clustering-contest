      <p>Police say they are treating the attack as attempted murder.</p>
      <p>The PSNI received a call about intruders at 9.15pm and found the injured the woman and child, who were then brought to hospital.</p>
      <p>The young girl sustained serious injuries and is in a critical but stable condition in hospital.</p>
      <p>A 41-year-old woman was also treated for stab wounds but is no longer in hospital.</p>
      <p>There was also a baby in the house, but it was left unscathed in the brutal attack.</p>
      <p>The PSNI have urged anyone with information to come forward.</p>
      <p>Detective Sergeant Keith Monaghan said: “Police received a report at around 9.15pm that a number of males, armed with machetes, had forced entry to a house and attacked two female occupants.</p>
      <p>"A 13 year old girl sustained serious stab wounds as a result and was taken to hospital where she remains in a critical but stable condition.</p>
      <p>"A 41 year old woman was also treated for stab wounds to her leg but has since been discharged from hospital. A baby was also present at the scene but was thankfully unharmed.</p>
      <p>“This must have been a terrifying ordeal for those involved and we are determined to find the men responsible.</p>
      <p>"We have several lines of enquiry which we are progressing at this time but I would ask anyone with information or who noticed any suspicious activity in the area to contact detectives in Enniskillen and pass that information on.</p>
      <p>"The number to call is 101 and the reference number is 1650 16/11/19".</p>
