      <p>Apple TV Plus launched earlier this month and one of its shows has surged past the others in audience demand. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-tv-plus-dickinson-is-most-popular-launch-show-2019-11">“Dickinson” broke through this week’s list</a>, as did Netflix’s “Atypical,” which recently debuted its third season.</p>
      <p>Every week, Parrot Analytics provides Business Insider with a list of the nine most in-demand TV shows on streaming services. The data is based on “<a href="https://support.parrotanalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/222663987-TV-demand-measurement-What-are-Demand-Expressions-">demand expressions</a>,” Parrot Analytics’ globally standardized TV demand measurement unit. Audience demand reflects the desire, engagement, and viewership weighted by importance, so a stream or download is a higher expression of demand than a “like” or comment on social media, for instance.</p>
