      <h1>Nottingham's social services dealing with record amount of children in gangs</h1>
      <h2>More than 200 children have been identified</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:31:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:31</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Jarram</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham's social services has 'flagged up' more than 200 cases where they are concerned about children joining or being part of a gang.</p>
      <p>The latest government figures have revealed that social services assessed 4,073 children in Nottingham in 2018/19.</p>
      <p>Of those, 223 were deemed to be either already in a gang, at risk of joining one, or at risk of violence from a gang.</p>
      <p>The number was up from 144 cases the year before, and nearly four times as many as the 59 cases seen in 2014/15, when the figures were published for the first time.</p>
      <p>Children and young people are 'flagged' if they are at risk of becoming or are already involved in criminal or anti-social gang activity.</p>
      <p>Children involved with gangs can be pressured into stealing or carrying drugs or weapons and are at an increased risk of abuse, exploitation, and being put in dangerous situations.</p>

      <p>Former world welterweight boxing champion Jawaid Khaliq runs a gym at the Sycamore Centre in St Ann's and is trying to deter kids, aged eight to 14, away from gang life with boxing sessions.</p>
      <p>He said: "I think things have got a lot worse, but a lot more youths are able to talk about it. In the past kids were scared.</p>
      <p>"Back in the day there were youth centres but they have been lost and they do not have places to go. Boxing is a brilliant tool to help kids learn discipline and respect."</p>
      <p>Former gang member turned mentor and boxing coach Marcellus Baz added: "There are high-level gangs out there but the issue we are seeing and facing is a lot of these young kids who want to be bad boys and want to live that life but don't realise the consequences and when they do it is too late.</p>
      <p>"One stupid decision can take away your world."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottinghamshire Police</a> said studies show that perpetrators who spiral into serious violent crime later in life were often first caught with a knife as young as 11.</p>
      <p>Police warned if a child has four adverse childhood experiences they are seven times more likely to be a violent offender, 11 times more likely to suffer from drug and alcohol problems, and 11 times more likely to be incarcerated.</p>
      <p>Councillor Cheryl Barnard, portfolio holder for children and young people at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/politics">Nottingham City Council</a>, said: "We are taking more effective action than ever to identify and support children and young people away from gang activity, taking a trauma-informed approach which seeks to recognise and respond to how childhood trauma links to victimisation and later life offending.</p>
      <p>"Overall, that is helping towards a significant fall in new entrants into the youth justice system in recent years.</p>
      <p>"However, the rise in numbers of children known to social services involved in this activity can be attributed to improved efforts to address the issues and because both child victims and perpetrators of gang-related activity are now logged so that they can be connected to appropriate services to reduce the risk of gang affiliation and further offending behaviour.</p>
      <p>"The rise is undoubtedly also reflecting a growing awareness and reporting of child criminal exploitation and adults grooming children to join gangs to distribute drugs as part of the national county lines problem.</p>
      <p>"We work with partners including the police, health providers and schools to identify children and young people at risk, safeguard victims and overcome any obstacles against prosecuting perpetrators.</p>
      <p>"Our Exploitation and Violence Reduction Hub set up last year offers support and guidance to families and children referred to them.</p>
      <p>"Its preventative work involves a range of schools programmes including gangs and weapons awareness, conflict resolution, healthy relationships and joint enterprise, as well as supporting targeted youth outreach groups and managing a number of young people at risk of involvement with child criminal exploitation and youth violence."</p>
