      <h2>A crazy night out in a new location</h2>

      <p>If we told you we went to an event that elicited some of the loudest screams we’ve ever heard, you might think it was a concert for an A-list popstar. In reality, the masses were giving themselves a hoarse voice over a box of Coco Pops, a cardboard cut-out of Philip Schofield, and a Henry Hoover, all of which were prizes at <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do/416060-bongos-bingo-is-making-a-grand-return-to-dubai">Bongo’s Bingo</a>.<br/><br/>The beloved night out, and a previous <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/music-nightlife-awards-2019/400129-simply-the-best-nights-out-in-town"><i>Time Out Dubai</i> Music &amp; Nightlife Award-winner</a>, is back in Dubai once again in a brand new home at <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/hotels/atlantis-the-palm">Atlantis The Palm</a>. Don’t be fooled by the glamorous décor inside the Asateer tent, this event is just as lively as ever. The rule about no dancing on the tables or benches was broken within seconds of the bingo games starting, and you’d better get a workout in before going because you’ll be getting up on your feet every other minute.<br/><br/>If you’ve never been before, the concept is simple. The creators of this global phenomenon took regular bingo (think grannies with pen dabbers, shushing you if you dare speak above a whisper) and added outrageous prizes plus music and dance moves to go with basically every number. It’s undoubtedly a recipe for success. Everything about the night seems completely random, in the best possible way (we're talking a Shania Twain megamix blasting from the speakers in the middle of the evening for no apparent reason).<br/><br/>The complete craziness of what’s happening on stage disguises the fact that this is a well-tuned event, honed over the years since it started in Liverpool back in 2015. The MC’s helpers have perfectly choreographed moves and happily dive into the crowd to keep spirits high. It keeps the crowds coming back time and again. Which is why if you want to go to the December Christmas edition (on December 12, again at Atlantis), then it's advisable to get booking.<br/><br/>It’s hard to put your finger on exactly what makes Bongo’s Bingo so brilliant, but you should definitely go and try to find out for yourselves. We’ll be coming back again, and again, and again.<br/><i>Dec 12, 8pm. Atlantis The Palm, Palm Jumeirah, <a href="http://dubai.platinumlist.net/">dubai.platinumlist.net</a>.</i></p>
