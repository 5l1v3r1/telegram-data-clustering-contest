      <h1>Cool Fan-Made STAR WARS Trailer Covers the Entire Skywalker Saga</h1>

      <p>With the Skywalker saga coming to an end with<b><i> Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i></b>, a <i>Star Wars</i> fan by the name of Alec Siegel has cut together an extremely cool trailer that covers all nine films that make up the Skywalker saga. It’s actually a really good fan trailer that might just tug at your heartstrings. It’s actually going to be really sad when the Skywalker saga comes to a close. I just hope that <b>J.J. Abrams</b> hits a grand slam with it because if he screws this up… well, he should stay off social media forever.</p>
