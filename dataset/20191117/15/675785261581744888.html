      <p>A little girl's Christmas wishlist for Santa has left her dad speechless - but for all the wrong reasons.</p>
      <p>The 10-year-old from the States has requested 26 items she would like to find under the tree next month.</p>
      <p>But instead of the usual Barbie or LEGO, the youngster from LA clearly already has a taste for the finer things in life.</p>
      <p>Among the gifts on her list are Gucci sliders, a Chanel purse, an iPhone 11, as well as a 'real bunny' and clothes for the bunny.</p>
      <p>She is also hoping for $4,000, a MacBook Air, a GoPro, perfume, makeup, clothes and 'asenchal [essential] oil'.</p>

      <p>Amusingly, the youngster has asked Santa to bring her an alarm clock, new sheets and cover, laundry detergent and pink duct tape too.</p>
      <p>Her dad shared the list on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , where it has gone viral, and joked she "must be out of her mind."</p>
      <p>One person quipped: "Sneaking in that 4K at the bottom is a rockstar move."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Get her that alarm clock sis ! Lol tell her it’ll wake her up from that dream where she think shes getting everything on there."</p>

      <p>A third mused: "You raised a boujee princess and now you wanna complain. Get mama her Gucci slides and stop playing."</p>
      <p>A fourth said: "She ten! She doesn’t need perfume! She needs to go out to play."</p>
      <p>Another added: "Looks like she's planning on moving out."</p>
