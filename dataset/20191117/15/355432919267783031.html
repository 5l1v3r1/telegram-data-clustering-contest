      <h1>GOP rep on impeachment: 'I think the evidence is crumbling'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:06:16+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:06</time> by <a rel="author">Justine Coleman</a></address>
      <p>Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/chris-stewart">Chris Stewart</a> (R-Utah), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Sunday that he thinks the evidence for impeaching <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> “is crumbling” after the first week of public hearings. </p>
      <p>"This Week" host <a href="https://thehill.com/people/george-stephanopoulos">George Stephanopoulos</a> said to Stewart on ABC that the evidence of a White House effort to influence Ukraine to investigate former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> by withholding military aid is "building," referencing private testimony from State Department aide David Holmes and former National Security Council official Tim Morrison.</p>
      <p>“It’s tied directly now to President Trump, isn’t it?” Stephanopoulos asked.</p>
      <p>“I disagree with you, George,” Stewart replied. “I don’t think the evidence is building at all, and I’m being sincere in this. I think the evidence is crumbling.”</p>

      <p>The Utah representative also condemned Democrats for “goal post moving” by changing the focus of their impeachment inquiry from a quid pro quo to bribery.</p>
      <p>Stewart noted that former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine <a href="https://thehill.com/people/marie-yovanovitch">Marie Yovanovitch</a> did not offer any evidence on Friday when he asked her during a public hearing if Trump committed bribery or criminal acts.</p>
      <p>“I think the longer these [hearings go] on, I think the less the American people are going to support impeachment because I think that the evidence just doesn’t support it,” Stewart said. </p>
      <p>Holmes <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/470747-state-department-official-confirms-he-overheard-conversation-between">reportedly testified</a> that he overheard a conversation between Trump and Ambassador to the European Union <a href="https://thehill.com/people/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a> about the Ukrainian pressure campaign. </p>
      <p>Morrison, meanwhile, told lawmakers that Sondland pushed Ukraine, on behalf of Trump, to launch two investigations that could help the president politically, according to a transcript <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/470793-read-top-nsc-aide-tim-morrisons-closed-door-impeachment-inquiry-testimony">release Saturday</a> by House Democrats.</p>
