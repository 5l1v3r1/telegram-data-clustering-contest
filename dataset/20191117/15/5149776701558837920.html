      <h1>More than 30 retail and business units are up for rent in Nottingham city centre - here's where</h1>
      <h2>The most expensive is on the market for more than £11,000 per month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:22:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:22</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Bunn</a></address>
      <p>Prominent retail and business units in some of Nottingham's busiest streets are among a host of buildings currently looking for occupants.</p>
      <p>More than 30 properties in the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-city-centre">city centre</a> alone are up for let, with prices ranging from more than £11,000 per month to just £100.</p>
      <p>According to Rightmove there are currently three units up for grabs in Exchange Arcade, off Long Row, while shops in Bridlesmith Gate, Fletcher Gate and Lister Gate are all looking for occupants.</p>
      <p>Historic Bridlesmith Gate was among those to have been hit by a spate of closures, including American Apparel, Pretty Green, Hobbs and the Tokenhouse recently.</p>
      <p>The redevelopment of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/broadmarsh-centre">intu Broadmarsh</a>, which is in the middle of an £89 million transformation, was labelled as one of the factors behind the street's demise.</p>

      <p>The street had suffered a drop in footfall because "what was once a natural route through to the top end of intu Broadmarsh is no longer active," <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/shops-blame-bridlesmith-gate-decline-3473412">Nottingham BID chairman Jeff Allen said in October</a> .</p>
      <p>The situation does appear to be improving slightly now as, for example, the prominent former H Samuel store in Lister Gate was taken on by Birds bakery in September.</p>
      <p>The empty unit opposite the intu Victoria Centre, on the corner of Clumber Street, which was due to be a Metro Bank, is also not listed.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the units currently available:</p>
      <h3>Broad Street, Nottingham</h3>

      <p>Fancy setting up your own bar in Hockley? Well this unit is up for grabs in Broad Street.</p>
      <p>Coming in at £4,583 per month, the site, formerly the Hockley Rebel, has a license to stay open until 3am and benefits from footfall from the likes of nearby Vodka Revolution, the Broadway Cinema and Brewdog.</p>
      <p>It has a dancefloor, ground floor bar or restaurant and a cellar.</p>
      <p>It has been put on the market by Box Property, which said in a statement: "Hockley is experiencing a surge in popularity thanks to its consistent day and night economy providing a vibrant atmosphere created by an eclectic mixture of on trend national and independent operators.</p>
      <p>"The premises benefit from a prime and central location."</p>
      <h3>Beastmarket Hill, Nottingham</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The former Dolcino cafe had a prime spot overlooking Old Market Square.</p>
      <p>Based in Beastmarket Hill, the company sold paninis, waffles hot drinks and, of course, gelato. But it closed for good in February this year.</p>
      <p>It is now on the market with Box Property for £4,583 per month.</p>
      <p>The unit has planning permission for a restaurant or cafe and is based over two floors.</p>
      <p>In a bid to entice potential occupiers to take up the site, Box Property said in a statement: "The Market Square is at the heart of Nottingham city centre and numerous events are held throughout the year including the Christmas Market, the “summer beach attraction”, Nottingham’s Food and Drink Festival and a monthly farmers market to name but a few."</p>
      <h3>19-21 Lister Gate, Nottingham</h3>

        <figcaption>19-21 Lister Gate is on the market at a rental value of more than £11,000 per month</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>You will need to have a bit of cash - and some vision - if you want to take on the priciest retail unit in Nottingham at the moment.</p>
      <p>Lister Gate is one of Nottingham's prominent city streets which has endured a tougher time of late with decreasing footfall due partly, perhaps, to the increase in work at intu Broadmarsh.</p>
      <p>But at a rental price of £11,417, it is clearly hoped retailers will see the potential of the area once work on the Broadmarsh - and the wider southern Gateway development - is complete.</p>
      <p>Eventually there will be new leisure facilities and shops at the Broadmarsh, while buildings such as HMRC's Unity Square near the train station will bring thousands of new workers to the area.</p>
      <p>It has permission for shops and financial and professional services and is surrounded by large national retailers such as River Island and Marks and Spencer.</p>
      <h3>Exchange Arcade, Nottingham</h3>

        <figcaption>Exchange Arcade has three units available</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>There are not one, not two, but three units ready for new occupiers at Exchange Arcade, in the heart of the city centre.</p>
      <p>The units are listed on Rightmove for between £6,250 per month and £5833 per calendar month.</p>
      <p>Retailers including Dr Martens and Harvey Jones are among the companies that are based here, while Flying Horse Walk is also just a short distance away.</p>
