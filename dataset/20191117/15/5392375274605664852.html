      <p>Unknown budget LG phone with a water-drop notch clears FCC<br/>3 (60%) 2 votes</p>
      <p>LG’s smartphone business has been on a downward spiral for quite some time, all thanks to the ever-increasing pressure Samsung the likes of Samsung, and a number of Chinese phone makers. The <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/08/05/lg-x2-k30-2019-is-official-with-5-45-inch-fullvision-display/">brand recently</a> announced that it is looking the way of the ODM (Original Design Manufacturer) business model to keep its smartphones afloat in the mobile market. This is especially true for low-end, and budget smartphones, but not the high-end LG series.</p>
      <p>Now, it appears the brand is on the verge of releasing a new budget smartphone, as it has now got one of its devices approved by the US Federal Communications Commission, or <a href="https://fccid.io/ZNFX210LMW">FCC</a>. The device bears the LM-X210LMW model number, and from the look of it appears to be on the budget level. Sadly, the FCC document does not reveal the specs sheet and even the official name of the device in question, but there are a couple of official images that reveal its entire design.</p>

      <p>The images shared on the FCC reveals that the said LG will come with a full-screen design featuring a centrally placed water-drop notch for a single rear camera. On the rear, the device is seen with a single rear camera on the left, with no evidence of a fingerprint scanner. Given that the device isn’t reminiscence of a premium or mid-range device, we would assume it will come with no fingerprint sensor for biometric authentication. It is also unlikely to get an in-display option.</p>

      <h3>LG  LM-X210LMW rear Panel</h3>
      <p>Notably, the rear panel of the unknown LG phone is removable, which perhaps, suggests it has a removable battery. On the lower edge,  there is a USB Type-C and two grilles, apparently for a speaker and a microphone, and on top, there is only a 3.5 mm headphone jack. The device has yet to appear on Geekbench, and other certification databases, so we might be hearing more about it in the coming days.</p>
