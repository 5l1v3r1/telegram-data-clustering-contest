      <p>The European model, for example, benefits from a restyled front fascia with an additional lower grille section next to the fog lamps. The main grille has been simplified for a cleaner look, and full-LED headlights are now available as an optional extra. The DRLs and grille inserts have been redesigned as well, and Obsidian Blue has been added to the color palette.</p>
      <p>16-inch alloy wheels open the list for the entry-level Civic in the Old Continent, and higher specifications level up to 17-inch rollers. 20s are exclusive to the high-performance <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/honda-increases-price-of-2019-civic-type-r-by-610-135886.html">Type R</a>, and Honda didn‚Äôt forget about the interior either. The textured motif over the glovebox and electrically adjustable eight-way driver‚Äôs seat are two of the highlights, joined by a few improvements to the infotainment system such as buttons and dials for the most essential functions.</p>
      <p>Versions below the Type R are available with three engine choices, starting with a 1.0-liter turbo three-cylinder rated at 126 PS (124 horsepower) and 200 Nm (148 pound-feet) of torque. The VTEC Turbo with 1.5 liters of displacement is good for 182 PS (180 horsepower) and 240 Nm (177 pound-feet) while the 1.6-liter turbo diesel i-DTEC engine cranks out 120 PS (118 horsepower) and 300 Nm (221 pound-feet). Customers can choose between three transmissions, namely a six-speed manual, nine-speed auto, and a <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/c.html#ge-continuously-variable-transmission"><u>CVT</u></a>.</p>
      <p>Honda Sensing comes standard for the 2020 model year, explaining the ¬£400 difference in starting price over the outgoing Civic in the United Kingdom. The safety suite includes Traffic Sign Recognition, Lane Departure Warning, Lane Keeping Assist System, <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/a.html#ge-adaptive-cruise-control"><u>Adaptive Cruise Control</u></a>, and Collision Mitigation Braking System.</p>
      <p>Manufactured in the UK for Europe, the newcomer will be available to order at ¬£18,845 from December 2019 and UK deliveries are scheduled to commence in January 2020. üèÅ</p>
