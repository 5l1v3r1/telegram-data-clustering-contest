      <p><a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/11/watch-harry-styles-drops-single-watermelon-sugar-video.html">Harry Styles</a> isn’t in a boy band anymore. He’s in a <i>man </i>band. The <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/05/liam-payne-strip-that-down-one-direction-diss.html">ex–One Direction</a> hunk was happy to remind the world of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/05/its-time-to-take-harry-styles-seriously.html">his musical past</a> with Liam, Niall, Louis, and, uh, Ringo, during his punchy <i>SNL </i>monologue, but he has more important things to talk about. What happened to the show’s steady drug supply? Did Simon Cowell really grow him and his friends in a test tube? Is he <i>really </i>playing that piano? “Everyone thinks the cast does a lot of cocaine, they don’t,” he tells us. “That’s why the show’s not good anymore.” Except tonight, that is, and we have his snazzy pants to thank.</p>
