      <p>Friday Olokor, Abuja</p>
      <p>The Independent National Electoral Commission on Sunday said that all the 30 ad hoc staff engaged for the Kogi State governorship election in Olamaboro Local Government Area have been found.</p>
      <p>The commission said they are safe, sound and back in their respective homes.</p>
      <p>The Chief Press Secretary to INEC chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi, made this known while reacting to a news report that 30 of its officers were missing.</p>
      <p>He said, “We can now confirm that all the 30 ad hoc staff engaged for the 2019 Kogi governorship election and posted to Polling Units 002, 006 and 013 at Olamaboro III; and Polling Units 006, 012, 015, 016, 022 at Imani 1 all in Olamaboro LGA have been accounted for.</p>
      <p>“They are safe, sound and back in their respective homes. The chairman of the commission has personally spoken with some of them and they confirmed that they are hale and hearty.</p>
      <p>“These election-day duty staff could not be accounted for initially following the violent attacks by some armed thugs at their respective duty posts after the close of polls.</p>
      <p>“The commission has established that none of them was either injured or killed. They were able to successfully conclude the result collation process before the commotion started.</p>
      <p>“The collated election results at LG level are now being announced at the State Collation Centre at the commission’s State Office in Lokoja.”</p>
