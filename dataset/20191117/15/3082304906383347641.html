        <b>Reports suggest that Jose Mourinho is “keeping a close eye” on the situation at Tottenham Hotspur – as he is interested in taking up a managerial role there, despite interest from Real Madrid.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10360791/jose-mourinho-tottenham-pochettino-real-madrid/"><i>The Sun</i></a> that claims that the former Manchester United and Chelsea manager is keeping tabs on Tottenham, amid rumours that manager Mauricio Pochettino will be sacked soon, following a string of dismal results.</p>
      <p>The report further adds that Mourinho had also been linked with a return to Real Madrid, because of Zinedine Zidane’s struggles in his ongoing second spell at the club.</p>
      <p>And meanwhile, Glen Johnson – who has played under Mourinho – recently shared his insight into how the Portuguese manager will approach his search for a new job, while speaking to <i>Express.</i></p>
      <p>“Jose is sitting in the shadows at the moment. He’s being patient and things change so quickly in football where a job that seems secure now, might not be in two months’ time,” he said, before adding:</p>
      <p>“Arsenal and Tottenham are the two places where the doors could be open sooner but I don’t think I could see him at Arsenal. He’ll wait for it to unfold over Christmas and perhaps he’ll cherry-pick after that.”</p>
      <p>“But I don’t think he’s the type to rush and get a job just for the sake of getting one,” Johnson concluded.</p>
      <p>As of now, it remains to be seen whether Tottenham will finally let to go of Pochettino and favour Mourinho’s return to the Premier League.</p>
