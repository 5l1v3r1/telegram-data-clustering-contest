        <b>Liberal pundits and activists criticized former President Barack Obama on Saturday morning after he suggested the Democratic Party should avoid leaning “too far left” ahead of the 2020 election.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Democrats laid into the former president after he <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/470777-too-far-left-hashtag-trends-on-twitter">urged</a> them to consider a moderate approach during a fundraising meeting Friday. Climate activists and pundits turned on Obama, suggesting on Twitter that he was enabling that white supremacists gain a foothold in American politics.</p>
      <p>“Saying ‘Americans are moderate than these wild leftists’ is basically conceding that the far right propaganda machine has prevailed,” Peter Daou, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, <a href="https://twitter.com/peterdaou/status/1195698535271927808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1195698535271927808&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fmedia%2F470777-too-far-left-hashtag-trends-on-twitter">wrote</a> in a tweet Saturday. He took credit for starting the hashtag.  </p>
      <p>“I launched the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TooFarLeft?src=hashtag_click">#TooFarLeft</a> tag because I’ve had it with Republicans, media elites, and corporate Dems enabling fascists while denigrating those who seek economic and social justice as ‘too far left,” <a href="https://twitter.com/peterdaou/status/1195762028763332608">he added</a> in a follow-up tweet.</p>

      <p>Other Democrats used the hashtag to express their own positions.</p>
      <p>Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, for instance, told her Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1195817892421554177">followers</a> Saturday that “if being #TooFarLeft means” believing “healthcare is a human right”and “all student debt should be canceled,” then “count me in.” Climate change activists also weighed in.</p>

      <p>“I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/toofarleft?src=hashtag_click">#toofarleft</a> because I trust scientists when they say we need ‘transformative change’ in ‘all aspects of society,’” Eric Holthaus, a meteorologist and activist, <a href="https://twitter.com/EricHolthaus/status/1195758729863532550">said Saturday</a> on Twitter. He linked to a 2018 Grist <a href="https://grist.org/article/scientists-calmly-explain-that-civilization-is-at-stake-if-we-dont-act-now/">article</a> titled “U.N. climate report shows civilization is at stake if we don’t act now.”</p>
      <p>This is not the first time Obama received push-back for warning against going too far left on some issues. Journalist Ernest Owens took exception when the former president criticized “woke” social justice warriors Nov. 1 <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/11/01/writers-bash-obama-woke/">during</a> a speech at the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago.</p>
      <p>“But the former president’s disdain for the kind of criticism that has become popular to dismiss as ‘cancel culture’ … is misguided,” Owens said in The New York Times on Nov. 1. Other writers expressed similar positions.</p>
      <p>“The former president took black and progressive movements to task, without understanding his own failure to deliver change,” Malaika Jabali, an activist and writer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/01/does-obamas-critique-of-radical-politics-help-bring-about-the-change-he-wanted">noted in a Nov. 1</a> Guardian editorial.</p>
