      <p>THOOTHUKUDI</p>
      <p>The widespread rain for almost last 48 hours here halted the normal life resulting in many low-lying areas getting inundated on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Residents of St. Maryâ€™s Colony, Lourdu Ammalpuram, Kalaingnar Nagar and Vetrivelpuram among other pockets were the worst hit in the rainfall.</p>
      <p>Though the initial showers on Friday were welcome, the continuous rainfall not only hit the normal life, but also forced people to remain indoors.</p>
      <p>The early morning rain on Sunday made people tough to reach out to markets and church for the service.</p>
      <p>As there was no sign of any rescue operation from the civic authorities, the agitated residents, numbering about 100, including women and children, assembled on Thalamuthu Nagar Road and resorted to a road blockade stir.</p>
      <p>On information, Thalamuthu Nagar police station Inspector Thangakrishnan and team rushed to the spot accompanied by Corporation engineers. On holding talks and giving an assurance to pump out the rainwater, the residents dispersed.</p>
      <p>As the news spread, DMK MLA Geetha Jeevan visited the residential colony. On seeking assistance from the Collector, a team of officers, including Additional Collector Vishnu Chandran and other officials came to the spot and oversaw the operation.</p>
      <p>The civic authorities arranged huge motors to pump out the rainwater and with the help of poclain, the water was channelled out from the road thus bringing relief to the residents.</p>
      <p>TANGEDCO officials too received calls from the public on power lines being snapped in some of the streets at Kalaignar Nagar since Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The residents urged the Corporation to immediately fill the potholes at least with debris so that the damage caused to the two-wheeler riders were not severe.</p>
