      <p>MADRID, Nov 17 — World champion Marc Marquez won the Valencia GP today with a superb performance for his 12<sup>th</sup> victory of the season to ensure that the Repsol Honda team won the teams’ world title.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old, who began the day behind Petronas Yamaha’s pole-sitter Fabio Quartararo, overtook the French rookie with a superb move in the eighth lap and never looked back to finish the race in 41 minutes, 21.469 seconds.</p>
      <p>Quartararo finished second, 1.026 seconds behind Spaniard Marquez, while Australia’s Jack Miller was third for the non-works Pramac Ducati team.</p>
      <p>Marquez, who won his sixth world title last month, recovered from an early fall to top the warm-up session earlier in the day but looked unstoppable in the race despite a slow start.</p>
      <p>Victory meant that the Repsol Honda team captured the teams championship ahead of Ducati, in addition to the constructors’ title for a memorable triple crown.</p>
      <p>Triple MotoGP world champion Jorge Lorenzo, who announced on Thursday that he would retire after the season-ending race, kept his cool in windy conditions that made racing tricky with a number of riders crashing out.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old Mallorcan, representing the Repsol Honda team, finished his illustrious career and an injury-blighted season in 13<sup>th</sup> place. — Reuters</p>
