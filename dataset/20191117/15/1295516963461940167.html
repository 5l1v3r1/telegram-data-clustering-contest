      <p>Lou Ferrigno, the star of the 1970's-1980's <i>The Incredible Hulk </i>series, shared why he was let down by the character's portrayal in <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/avengers-4/">Avengers: Endgame</a>.</i></p>
      <p>At Canada's Hamilton Comic Con, Ferrigno explained his disappointment, stating, "What’s happening is that the first two Hulk movies, the CGI was improving, but the last one, <i>Endgame</i>, I was disappointed," he said. Ferrigno added, "Because the Hulk needs to be hideous, he needs to be a creature."</p>

      <p>The actor went on to place most of the blame on Disney and actor Mark Ruffalo. "You see in <i>Endgame</i>, Mark Ruffalo — I think it has a lot to do with him and Disney — I didn’t like the way it portrayed [Hulk]," Ferrigno continued. "It took away that beauty, that quality of the Hulk. That’s why a lot of people liked the series."</p>
