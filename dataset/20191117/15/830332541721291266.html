      <p>(CNN) - The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-inquiry-11-16-19/index.html">impeachment hearings</a> received a melodramatic twist on the "Saturday Night Live" cold open.</p>
      <p>Now known as "Days of Our Impeachment," the hearings got the daytime soap opera treatment that included a continuously fainting woman played by Heidi Gardner and a cameo by Jon Hamm, who played <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/politics/bill-taylor-ukraine-impeachment-donald-trump/index.html">Bill Taylor</a>, the<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/politics/bill-taylor-ukraine-impeachment-donald-trump/index.html"> witness and top diplomat in Ukraine</a>.</p>
      <p>"Unlike other people in the Trump administration, I show up," Hamm's Taylor said during SNL's hearing.</p>
      <p>No soap opera would be complete without a dramatic kiss, and SNL made it between US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Melissa Villasenor) and Hamm's Taylor.</p>
      <p>"Alexandria, I didn't expect to see you here," Hamm's Taylor said with music playing in the background and wind blowing the fictional Ocasio-Cortez's hair.</p>
      <p>"I didn't expect for you to be such a lowkey daddy," Villasenor's Ocasio-Cortez said before locking lips with Hamm. "Now, here's a Red New Deal, it's my lips."</p>
      <p>The skit ended with a wild cameo from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/15/us/nfl-browns-steelers-helmet-brawl-myles-garrett-suspended/index.html">Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett</a> (Kenan Thompson) swinging a football helmet at Rudy Giuliani (Kate McKinnon).</p>
      <p>"I'm tired of being falsely accused," Thompson's Garrett said, adding he was just trying to put a helmet back on the other player he's accused in real life of trying to hit.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, McKinnon's Giuliani appeared, startling the fictional Garrett.</p>
      <p>"Oh my god! It's a vampire," Thompson's Garrett said before striking the fictional Giuliani with the helmet.</p>
      <p>"I think he actually might have fixed me," McKinnon's Giuliani said.</p>
      <p>Harry Styles, formerly of the English boy band One Direction, was <a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1195937258119057408?s=20">the host and musical guest.</a></p>
