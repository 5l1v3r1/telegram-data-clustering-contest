      <h1>Air racing tournament unveils an all-electric sports aircraft</h1>
      <h2>The Airbus-backed White Lightning is built for very low-altitude competition.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:35:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/28/airbus-e-fan-x-hybrid-electric-aircraft/">electric aircraft</a> seen to date have focused more on raw utility than thrill-seeking, but that's about to change very shortly. Air Race E, an air racing tournament backed by Airbus, has formally <a href="https://www.airbus.com/search.image.html?tags=events%3Aairshows%2Fdubai-airshow%2Fdas19&amp;tagLogicChoice=OR#searchresult-image-all-1">unveiled</a> what it bills as the first electric race aircraft. The Condor Aviation-made White Lightning looks like a typical competitive single-seater, but packs an electric motor that can propel it to 300MPH while handling tight turns on a 3.1-mile circuit at just 33 feet off the ground.</p>
      <p>The lithium battery is short-lived, to put it mildly -- the White Lightning can last for just five minutes of all-out racing, and 10 minutes of reserve flight at lower power. You won't see any endurance races with this one. Air Race E chief Jeff Walkman instead describes the airplane and the tournament as a "test bed" that will foster electric flight as a whole.</p>
      <p>The racing tourney doesn't kick off until 2020, and some details have yet to be nailed down. Air Race E is only poised to name the eight teams for the first race later this week. It could represent a milestone for high-speed electric flight, though, and the technological discoveries made here could translate to everyday air travel in the years ahead.</p>
