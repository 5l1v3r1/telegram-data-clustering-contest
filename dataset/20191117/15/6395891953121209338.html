      <p>HADLEY, Mass. (AP) - Supporters of what is believed to be the largest colony of barn swallows in Massachusetts are protesting the proposed demolition of the colony's decades-old nesting habitat.</p>
      <p>Activists say they are gathering Saturday at the Bri-Mar stable at the Fort River Division of the Silvio O. Conte National Wildlife Refuge in Hadley.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed demolishing the building. Officials with the service said Saturday they are working to find a "course of action that is sustainable and compatible" with the purposes of the refuge and mission of the service.</p>
      <p>The group Save Our Swallows, an organization that activists say includes scientists and community members, has opposed the move, saying the barn is home to a thriving colony of the swallows, including 37 pairs in 2018.</p>
      <p>Managers of the refuge have said the barn is at risk of collapse.</p>
      <p>Barn swallows are in steep decline in the Northeastern U.S. and in Canada.</p>
