      <h1>Sunderland's stagnating campaign has not been fixed by a managerial change</h1>
      <h2>A change of manager has not transformed Sunderland's fortunes, with the real problems lying in the boardroom and the dressing room</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Hunter</a></address>
      <p>In cricket, there is an oft-quoted maxim which states you don't know what a good score looks like until both teams have batted.</p>
      <p>A footballing equivalent might go something along the lines of you don't know whether a manager has underperformed with a group of players until someone else has had a crack.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> owner <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/stewart-donald">Stewart Donald</a> clearly felt <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> had underperformed with this squad when he sacked him last month, and a good many fans agreed with him.</p>
      <p>But if the Black Cats had gone backwards under Ross at the beginning of this season compared to last - and results and performances suggested that was indeed the case - they have regressed further and faster since his successor <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Phil Parkinson</a> was appointed.</p>
      <p>So far, there has been no sign that the decline has been arrested, never mind reversed.</p>
      <p>To be fair, it is still early days for Parkinson, who is an experienced manager with a proven track record of winning promotion at this level.</p>
      <p>He has been in charge just a little over four weeks and has been plunged into a hectic schedule which has seen the club play eight games in all competitions when he has barely had time to get his feet under the table.</p>
      <p>But two wins out of eight games is not a 'new manager bounce'.</p>
      <p>Parkinson's league record at Sunderland reads played four: won two, lost two.</p>
      <p>They have been knocked out of the Carabao Cup on penalties at Oxford United, two embarrassing and unacceptable performances against Leicester U21s and League Two strugglers Scunthorpe United saw them exit the EFL Trophy at the group stage, and a wholly unconvincing draw at home to Gillingham in the FA Cup means they have a replay to contend with next week.</p>

      <p>So results over the last month suggest that Ross was not the handbrake that was holding back this team.</p>
      <p>After all, when the change was made Sunderland were lying sixth in the table, with 19 points on the board after 11 games, four points shy of the automatic promotion places and with a game in hand over second-placed Wycombe Wanderers, had lost just two games in all competitions, and had knocked Premier League sides Burnley and Sheffield United out of the Carabao Cup.</p>
      <p>After Saturday's results, they were ninth, eight points off the automatic promotion pace - albeit still with a game in hand - having lost two of their four league games under Parkinson, are out of the Carabao Cup and EFL Trophy and are clinging on in the FA Cup.</p>
      <p>Perhaps Ross was not the problem after all. Maybe this team is just not good enough.</p>
      <p>Turgid performances have delivered bang average results, and the Black Cats look anything but automatic promotion contenders.</p>
      <p>As for being a team capable of racking up 100 points - the wildly unrealistic target set in May by Donald and executive director <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/charlie-methven">Charlie Methven</a> - don't make me laugh.</p>
      <p>The problems on the pitch are a reflection of those in the boardroom, where two takeover deals have fallen through, outside investment from the American FPP group has turned out to be a £9m loan secured against the club, the stadium and the training ground, and fans are now openly questioning the direction in which Sunderland is headed under Donald and Methven.</p>
      <p>Mark Campbell's abortive takeover paralysed the club's recruitment plans for much of the summer, and when the deal fell through it left Sunderland scrambling to make up for lost time so it is hardly surprising that the squad is weaker this season than last.</p>
      <p>Quality players with Premier League experience such as Lee Cattermole, Bryan Oviedo, and George Honeyman, were among those who moved on, to be replaced by four free transfers, two loan signings, and with <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/george-dobson">George Dobson</a> the only addition who attracted even a modest fee.</p>
      <p>Then the FPP group held takeover talks before ultimately against it and instead deciding to loan Donald, Methven and fellow shareholder Juan Sartori money which has been earmarked for a range of uses, including repairs to the Stadium of Light roof, repair of a lift at the training ground, new speakers at the stadium, an expanded scouting and recruitment staff, and bringing the club's academy up to scratch so that it retains its prestigious Category One status.</p>
      <p>Such investment is desperately needed, but it was not the kind of thing Sunderland fans had in mind when they heard that a group of American billionaires with links to Michael Dell, of Dell Computers, were buying into the club.</p>
      <p>Investment notwithstanding, these are worrying times for Sunderland.</p>
      <p>Last season there was a feeling that everyone was pulling in the same direction, new owners, fans, management, and players.</p>
      <p>It was not all sweetness and light, certainly not behind the scenes, but to the outside world there was a clear sense of purpose.</p>
      <p>That has now unravelled.</p>
      <p>There is uncertainty over the long-term ownership of the club, results have headed south, the current owners have come under pressure, they have hit the panic button marked 'in case of emergency, sack manager', and the club is in danger of becoming bogged down in mediocrity.</p>
      <p>There is still time for Sunderland to improve, not least by bringing in players in January to address the chronic lack of goals from frontmen <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/will-grigg">Will Grigg</a> , <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/charlie-wyke">Charlie Wyke</a> , and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/marc-mcnulty">Marc McNulty</a> , who have managed only four league goals between them.</p>
      <p>But there are another six league games before the transfer window opens, and Sunderland cannot afford to wait that long.</p>
      <p>The improvement must start long before the transfer window opens, it must start in the next league game against Coventry City next Saturday.</p>
      <p>It must be a dramatic shift and it must be sustained over the final two-thirds of the season.</p>
      <p>Because unless things change, based upon what we have seen so far, Sunderland will be steeling themselves for a third successive season in League One next year.</p>
