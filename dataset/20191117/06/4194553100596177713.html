      <h1>Genk star Sander Berge admits he’d like to play at Anfield “as often as possible”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:37:18+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool played host to Genk in the group stages of the 2019/20 Champions League season, and the Belgian champions felt the cold steel of the Red sword.</p>
      <p>To be fair, they made a really good account of themselves and earned a 2-1 loss, even though Liverpool hounded them for the best part of the 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>But Anfield left an impression on one of their star players, and it seems he now may be hinting at a future transfer to the club.</p>
      <p>Sander Berge, a towering 21-year-old midfielder, has admitted that he’d want to play at the Reds’ stadium “<b>as often as possible</b>“, after his experience.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Norwegian broadcaster TV2 <a href="http://www.insidefutbol.com/2019/11/16/i-could-play-at-anfield-more-often-admits-liverpool-linked-midfielder/443263/">(via Inside Futbol)</a>, he said: “<b>Playing at Anfield is a dream for everyone in the world, and not least for Norwegians.</b></p>
      <p>“<b>Liverpool are the best team [at the moment] and have the most fans. So I could certainly like to play at Anfield as often as possible.</b>”</p>
      <p>Berge has been an important part of Genk’s team so far this season, and his current contract has two years left on it, but there’s been next to no word on Liverpool being interested in the young midfielder.</p>
      <p>With Marko Grujic due to return to Anfield in the summer, I’d be very surprised if we make a move for Berge – and, to be fair, the lad is likely just paying the club a compliment.</p>
