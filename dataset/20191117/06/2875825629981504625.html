      <h1>Denmark don't regard Ireland with enough respect, says Mick McCarthy</h1>
      <h2>Tomorrow’s monster Euro 2020 decider in Dublin will be the sixth meeting in two years since the harrowing World Cup play-off</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul O'Hehir</a></address>
      <p>Ireland boss Mick McCarthy has come out firing by claiming Denmark “do not regard us with enough respect”.<br/><br/>Tomorrow’s monster Euro 2020 decider in Dublin will be the sixth meeting in two years since the harrowing World Cup play-off.<br/><br/>After the drawn first leg, Danish midfielder Thomas Delaney said playing Martin O’Neill’s team was like “trying to open a tin of beans with your bare hands’.”<br/><br/>A year later, Delaney then labelled Ireland ‘primitive’ and ‘the most annoying team’ in international football.<br/><br/>Last month, Denmark and Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel panned Ireland’s qualification chances as they are “so bad.”<br/><br/>And Denmark manager Age Hareide last week said he was “pissed off” playing the Boys in Green so often.</p>

      <p>But ahead of Monday’s showdown, McCarthy said: “Well I hope he's more pissed off on Tuesday morning after playing us. <br/><br/>“They certainly won't want to lose to us, that's for sure. They don't regard us with enough respect I don't think. <br/><br/>“See when you make all those comments? You have to win then. You have got to win if you dis the opposition and I make a point of never doing it. <br/><br/>“They've said it! And they will not want to lose against us. That would piss them off. I think you should respect your opponent and do your best to beat them.” <br/><br/>While McCarthy was only in charge of Ireland for this year’s drawn game in Copenhagen, he insists the dismissive comments are motivation. <br/><br/>“I just makes me more determined to do it,” he said. “They said it publicly, bloody hell! And you lot all reminded me. <br/><br/>“Age Hareide , I have the utmost respect for and I think he for me. But, well, just the comments. They all made them.”</p>
