      <h2>Reds legend Mark Lawrenson says Liverpool FC have more belief this season</h2>

      <h3>Mark Lawrenson believes Liverpool FC aren’t a better team this season but admitted Jurgen Klopp’s squad have more belief this term.</h3>
      <p>The Reds are sitting at the top of the Premier League table and eight points clear of Leicester City and Chelsea FC.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC were 3-1 winners against defending champions Manchester City at Anfield last weekend.</p>
      <p>The Merseyside outfit failed to beat Manchester City last term as Klopp’s side finished in second place and a point adrift of the title holders.</p>
      <p>The 18-time English champions have already beaten Arsenal, Chelsea FC, Leicester, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur this term.</p>
      <p>Only Manchester United have managed to prevent Liverpool FC from claiming three points in Premier League this season.</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool FC defender Lawrenson explained what’s different about the Merseyside outfit this term.</p>
      <p>“They’re not a better team than last year but they’ve now got belief,” Lawrenson told the <i>Off The Ball</i> show on Irish radio station <i>Newstalk</i>.</p>
      <p>“When you win a trophy, whatever trophy it is, if it’s winning the Champions League or the League Cup, it gives players belief. They want more of it.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC will be hoping to win their first Premier League title under Klopp this season following his appointment as Brendan Rodgers’ replacement in October 2015.</p>
      <p>The Reds finished in second place in the Premier League table last term despite collecting a club-record tally of 97 points.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC won the Champions League title last season thanks to a 2-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur in Madrid back in June.</p>
      <p>Their triumph ended Klopp’s silverware drought since his appointment.</p>
