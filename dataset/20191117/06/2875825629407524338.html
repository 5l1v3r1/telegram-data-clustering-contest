      <h2>If he plays, the 28-year-old won’t afford himself a moment to smell the roses in front of a sell-out Aviva</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Conor Hourihane hopes a non-stop search for improvement has put him back in the frame for tomorrow’s winner-takes-all clash with Denmark.</p>
      <p>If he plays, the 28-year-old won’t afford himself a moment to smell the roses in front of a sell-out Aviva after the sheer graft of making it to within one win from Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>“I’m all about the hard work in this qualification campaign and the hard work down through the years,” said Hourihane.</p>
      <p>“And it definitely won’t be a piece of p*** on Monday, if you want to quote that.</p>
      <p>“Denmark are a very, very good side, we’ll probably go in as underdogs and hopefully that might suit us.”</p>
      <p>Hourihane puts his progress from Barnsley in League Two to the Premier League with Aston Villa down to an indefatigable appetite for work.</p>
      <p>He describes himself as his own toughest critic - and the Corkman instantly knew why he was dropped for Ireland’s last qualifier, the 2-0 loss in Switzerland. “I was poor against Georgia, I thought,” Hourihane said, reflecting on the scoreless draw in Tbilisi.</p>

      <p>“And I think a few of the lads would agree we probably weren’t at our best.</p>
      <p>“It was just one of those days but we came away with a vital point and it’s a cup final now against Denmark.”</p>
      <p>Most of those who will be involved didn’t feature in the 3-1 win against New Zealand on Thursday.</p>
      <p>But Hourihane was delighted that Mick McCarthy gave him half an hour in the engine room, looking on his run out as another chance to press his credentials.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to get on,” he stressed. “I love playing for my country. Another cap, fantastic.</p>
      <p>“Mick has always been good to me from that point of view. Whenever I play, I try to put in a performance to repay that faith.</p>
      <p>“It was an opportunity for lads to stake a claim on Thursday night. The gaffer will decide if someone has done enough but every game is an opportunity to shine.</p>
      <p>“It’s good to get another victory for the feelgood factor going into Monday. We had a job to do because if we didn’t win, lads wouldn’t be happy.</p>
      <p>“We had to be professional, it was job done well and the lads scored well-taken goals.”</p>

      <p>A non-playing sub in Geneva, Hourihane got down to work at the final whistle, making sure he made the most of on-field work-out.</p>
      <p>It’s all part of his ‘every day counts’ outlook as he prepared himself for his return to Villa, and immediate start to his bid to get back in the Ireland line-up.</p>
      <p>“All those bits of hard work takes you where you are,” he said. “It’s all been instilled in me.</p>
      <p>“Nothing has come easy to me or my family - it’s been a long journey.</p>
      <p>“I’ve always had to scrap for everything I’ve got, and it’s where I am now. I’m always up for the challenge of battling for places with other players and when you get chances like Thursday you’ve got to take them, because chances slip by.</p>
      <p>“When those opportunity has come along, I’ve taken the majority of them. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t be here.</p>
      <p>“Hard work is what I pride myself on. </p>
