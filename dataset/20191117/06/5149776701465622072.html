      <h1>Comment: Nottingham needs real firepower if it is to take control of its destiny</h1>
      <h2>Lord Bob Kerslake is chairing the UK2070 commission into regional inequalities</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lord Bob Kerslake</a></address>
      <p>Fifty years ago, Nottingham was at the height of its industrial pomp. Queen of the Midlands, home of Raleigh, Players, Boots and numerous textiles businesses.</p>
      <p>It was only a few years since Albert Finney had starred in the film version of ‘Saturday Night and Sunday Morning’ and there was probably a real sense that the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-city-centre">city</a> was very much in charge of its own destiny.</p>
      <p>Can we say the same today? I’m not sure we can. Nearly all of the certainties that provided the foundations for life in those days have gone. Industrial jobs for life are a thing of the past and what that has left behind is a challenging legacy around education and skills.</p>
      <p>For many cities in the Midlands and the North that and other factors have led to a pervasive feeling that we are not doing as well as we might as either places or people – and that we are no longer in control of our destiny.</p>
      <p>How has that happened? I began with a perspective of 50 years because it’s important to understand that these challenges have not grown up overnight. They are partly the result of some long-term changes in the way in which we govern our country, changes that have gone largely unnoticed but which have had a profound impact on regional Britain in particular.</p>
      <p>The UK is an unusually centralised country, with a much higher proportion of spending decisions taken by central government than is the case in similar nations. Those decisions are not always the wisest because they lack local understanding, and the mechanisms government sets up to deliver regional investment have been chopped, changed and often under-resourced. The Treasury, which holds the purse strings, also has a set of rules which tend to favour investment in places which are already doing well.</p>
      <p>So where we need real firepower to seed growth we have been making do with pea-shooters. Where we need sustained intervention to tackle ingrained problems we have been using sticking plaster. Where Wales and Scotland have had the same investment agencies for decades, England has worked its way through urban development corporations, regional development agencies, local enterprise partnerships and now combined authorities.</p>
      <p>Remarkably, the UK has neither a national spatial strategy – a framework which would ensure coherence and consistency in regional investment – nor a long-term vision for the future.</p>
      <p>The results of these long-term failings are disturbing. In London we have a globally successful city that we should all be proud of. But in other UK regions the levels of inequality and deprivation are among the worst in Europe.</p>

      <p>To give you an example, a child receiving free school meals in the London borough of Hackney is still three times more likely to go to university than a similar child in Hartlepool. The further north you travel, the poorer the infrastructure becomes. Even healthy life expectancy – a basic measure of prosperity – is 19 years lower in our poorest regions.</p>
      <p>Worryingly, the research carried out by the UK2070 Commission suggests that we may be approaching a tipping point: that unless decisive long-term action is taken to tackle regional inequality and rebalance our economy, the Midlands and the North may be locked into decline whilst a costly, overcrowded London begins to overheat.</p>
      <p>What should that action be? It has to go beyond changing policies or tinkering with budgets. We need to look at the whole system.</p>
      <p>The UK2070 Commission has proposed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A £250bn UK Renewal Fund which would support the rebalancing of the economy over a 25-year period.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A plan for England which would set out funding priorities and make sure investments are coordinated.</li>
        <li>Changing Treasury investment rules so that they properly reflect regional potential.</li>
        <li>Protecting people from the impacts of climate change and technology whilst also harnessing their potential.</li>
        <li>Making sure marginalised communities are given the service standards they need and are properly connected to the world around them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To make that work, we also need to return decision-making to regions and localities through a significant acceleration of devolution. Local ownership of solutions will lead to better-designed policies which achieve meaningful results.</p>
      <p>The question is not how we pay for all this but whether we’re willing to accept the continuing cost of not doing so - a cost which will be measured not only in the persistent economic under-performance of the UK but in damaged lives and deprived communities.</p>
      <p>We cannot turn back the clock. But we can certainly regain our pride and our sense of purpose. Cities like Nottingham and the regions they are part of need to be given the freedom and the firepower to do so. Reducing the distance between government the people it is here to serve will help us achieve that.</p>
