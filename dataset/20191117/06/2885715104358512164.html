      <p>After recent research showed that women in Brazil earn 20% less than men for the same work, São Paulo’s Paulista Women’s Championship displayed a different score on the screens during the second leg title clash between Corinthians and Sao Paulo.</p>
      <p>When Corinthians took the lead five minutes into the first half, the official scoreboard flashed Corinthians 0.8 – 0 São Paulo instead of 1-0, displaying 20% of the first goal by Victoria Albuquerque.</p>
      <p>The same was done for the other goals, screen showing 1.6-0 when Juliet scored the second and 2.4 when Millene completed the third. The initiative was part of an action of the Paulista Football Federation (FPF) with the UN Women and the advertising agency BETC.</p>

      <p>“We believe that the decision of the Female Paulista, which ends with a record historical visibility, is an opportunity to question the fact that women still have lower pay compared to men in the labor market. It is essential, especially nowadays, to bring important discussions for the growth of our society, “said Aline Pellegrino, Women’s Football Director of the Paulista Football Federation.</p>
      <p>Corinthians beat local rival Sao Paulos 3-0 in front of a packed crowd in the Arena Corinthians. Corinthians had also won the first leg 1-0. The final was attended by 28,862 fans, record attendance at women’s soccer game in Brazil. Match tickets had been given out for free during the week.</p>
