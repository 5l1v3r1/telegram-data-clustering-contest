      <h2>New life is being breathed into the historic landfill at Glen Esk thanks to funding from the Scottish Government Vacant Derelict Land Fund.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Findlay, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicola-findlay/</a></address>
      <p>A new £1m greenspace in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a> is nearing completion.</p>
      <p>Funded via the Scottish Government Vacant Derelict Land Fund, the 7.6 hectare site is based at a historic landfill at Glen Esk and now incorporates native planting and habitat creation, footpaths, boundary treatments, artwork, an outdoor classroom, a junior mountain bike track and a car park.</p>

      <p>Chair of South Lanarkshire Council’s Community and Enterprise Resources Committee, Councillor John Anderson, said: “This development will have a positive impact on the local area and will create a space for the whole community to enjoy.</p>
      <p>“It creates a positive link between residential estates with the increase of core paths and greenspace networks in this location.</p>
      <p>“I am sure it will encourage more people to walk and cycle to here to enjoy the impressive outdoor space that has been created.</p>
      <p>“It is an amazing transformation and I was delighted to see how much the children enjoyed being in the park – no doubt they will return many times with their friends and family.”</p>

      <p>St Leonard’s head teacher, Lorraine Mullen, said: “The children who visited the park had a fantastic time and really enjoyed taking part in the bulb planting.</p>
      <p>“It helps give them a real sense of ownership of the park, they will be able to come back here and point out the area that they helped develop.”</p>

      <p>“Well done to all the children who were great ambassadors for their school.”</p>
