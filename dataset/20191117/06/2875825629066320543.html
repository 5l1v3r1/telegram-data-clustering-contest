      <h1>James McCarthy's Ireland future uncertain after rejecting call-up</h1>
      <h2>The Crystal Palace midfielder made himself unavailable for the New Zealand and Denmark games for ‘personal reasons’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul O'Hehir</a></address>
      <p>James McCarthy is facing an uncertain international future with the Republic of Ireland.</p>
      <p>The Crystal Palace midfielder made himself unavailable for the New Zealand and Denmark games for ‘personal reasons’.</p>
      <p>He was named in the provisional squad and boss Mick McCarthy indicated he would have featured in the Kiwi friendly.</p>
      <p>McCarthy, 28, has stressed that he wants to be playing regularly for his new club before he focuses on international football.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear what the personal reasons are, although the Ireland manager claims he has not fallen out with the player who last donned an Ireland shirt just over three years ago.</p>
      <p>Ireland boss McCarthy said: “There is no problem with me, it’s his decision.</p>
      <p>“You have access to him so ask him yourself. I’m not going to discuss what I discussed with him.</p>
      <p>“The discussion I had with him was over the New Zealand game. And for personal reasons he’s not here so, please, speak to him and ask him.</p>
      <p>“I’m cool with what he’s decided. I haven’t fallen out with anybody. Categorically not and I told him I wanted him to come in.</p>
      <p>“He’d have been involved against New Zealand but he couldn’t come for his own reasons.”</p>
      <p>Asked if McCarthy could feature next year at the Euros or in a playoff if its needed, McCarthy said: “I’m not ruling anybody out, we don’t have such a big squad to do that.”</p>
