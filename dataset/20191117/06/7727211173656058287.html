      <h2>Liverpool and Everton must use this opportunity to put Merseyside back on the map in the women's game</h2>

      <p>Of all the matches taking place during the FA's Women's Football Weekend, Liverpool vs Everton at Anfield is arguably the most significant.</p>
      <p>Spurs are hosting Arsenal at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium, the in-form Manchester United take on league leaders Chelsea and there'll be a repeat of last year's FA Cup final as Man City play West Ham.</p>
      <p>These games may be more exciting on paper. But for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a>, two teams who have struggled both on the pitch and off it, having a women's derby at Anfield is huge.</p>
      <p>As the sport slowly turned professional, Merseyside saw its best talents leave the area for clubs offering more money and bigger opporunities.</p>
      <p>The knock-on effect was inevitable and neither club has mounted a serious challenge at the top of the table since Liverpool's back-to-back title wins in 2013 and 2014.</p>
      <p>In fact, Liverpool avoided relegation by just five points a year later.</p>
      <p>Everton had already suffered that fate. Relegated in 2014, it took them three years to get back to the top flight.</p>
      <p>Now it's the Reds bottom of the table with just one point and one goal in five league games while the Blues are only four points off leaders Chelsea.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly Liverpool see today's game as a chance to kick-start their season. What better way to get your first three league points than against your bitter rivals?</p>
      <p>But perhaps more important is the opportunity both clubs have to grow their fan base.</p>
      <p>Considering their league position, a crowd of 924 for Liverpool's game against Bristol City earlier this season was fairly impressive. But Chelsea have regularly been selling out their ground at Kingsmeadow and over 4,000 people watched Manchester United beat Manchester City in the Continental Cup.</p>
      <p>Everton, who play their games at Southport's Haig Avenue, struggle to attract more than 500. The Blues are hoping a move to Walton Hall Park in the New Year will bring in bigger crowds.</p>

      <p>But Merseyside needs to fall in love with women's football again. Both clubs have experienced what it's like to be at the top but to challenge now, they need backing and support - both financial and physical.</p>
      <p>There are posters all around London advertising Spurs' match against Arsenal - I've not seen one poster promoting the derby in the centre of Liverpool. Without wanting to sound critical, it would have been an easy thing to do and could have raised the profile of the game even more.</p>
      <p>But if the Reds can get 20,000 people through the gates this afternoon it will be a huge step in the right direction.</p>
      <p>An entertaining and competitive game will hopefully encourage some of these supporters to come back.</p>
      <p>Everton look like they have a match-winner in Chloe Kelly who is currently the division's top scorer. It could be a tough afternoon for Liverpool if the Blues winger is on form.</p>
      <p>The Reds will look to Melissa Lawley to be the creator but Rinsola Babajide could cause Everton problems with her pace. It's often the final ball or shot that lets the winger down and a clinical touch in the final third is what has been missing for Vicky Jepson's side.</p>
      <p>Courtney Sweetman-Kirk netted seven times last season but is still waiting for her first goal in this campaign. A former Everton player, there would be no better time for the striker to get up and running.</p>
      <p>Today's result could be significant for how the rest of the season pans out. But arguably the most important part of today is the opportunity both clubs have to put Merseyside back on the map in the women's game.</p>
