      <p>Popular security analyst and Chief Executive of Irbard Security Consult, Alhaji Irbard Ibrahim has declared that the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) cannot win the 2020 elections by accusing President Akufo-Addo and his appointees of sleeping at important public events.</p>
      <p>Making his opinion known on social media sighted by <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a>, the vocal commentator on various issues argued that even though he likes the NDC, he is clear in his mind that spreading pictures and videos of the President and his appointees sleeping at various events, will not make the NDC win the upcoming 2020 presidential and parliamentary elections.</p>
      <p>Rather, he thinks that spreading such pictures and videos could rather be counterproductive since sleeping or dozing off at events could mean that the President and his appointees are working hard.</p>
      <p>“I like the main opposition party and I think H.E John Mahama is a nice gentleman. But the incessant chorus of sleep is not an election winner. Which human being on earth doesn’t sleep? Does dozing off a bit rather not signify hardwork instead of the meaning people always read into sleep?” He wrote on Facebook.</p>
      <p>Recently there was a trending video of President Akufo-Addo allegedly sleeping at a summit in Russia. The NDC was critical of the President over the incident.</p>
      <p>At yesterday’s budget reading in Parliament last Wednesday November 13, 2019, there have been pictures of some appointees, notably the Minister of Agriculture, sleeping as the Finance Minister read the budget.</p>
