      <h1>Trump-backed candidate loses Louisiana governor’s race</h1>

      <p>Louisiana’s Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards declared victory  against Republican rival Eddie Rispone late Saturday — a narrow win that came despite <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/trump-says-impeachment-probe-has-been-very-hard-on-family/">President Trumps’s aggressive support</a> for the GOP challenger.</p>
      <p>Trump had routed Hillary Clinton in Louisiana by 20 points in 2016.</p>
      <p>“How sweet it is!” Edwards told a crowd of supporters, adding that he had spoken with Rispone by phone.</p>
      <p>“And as for the president,” Edwards quipped. “God bless his heart.”</p>
      <p>The Associated Press named Edwards the victor with 96 percent of precincts reporting and an advantage of just over 19,300 votes.</p>
      <p>Trump had lobbied hard for the Republican businessman, making three separate trips to Louisiana to rally Republican voters.</p>
      <p>But those efforts fell short, making Edwards Louisiana’s sole Democratic statewide elected official.</p>
      <p>The result serves as a stinging setback for Trump and the GOP, especially after Kentuckians <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/05/kentucky-governors-race-dem-andy-beshear-declares-victory-gov-matt-bevin-wont-concede/">voted in a Democratic governor</a> just 11 days ago, again despite the president’s campaigning.</p>
      <p>While his repeated appearances boosted Republican turnout, observers said his injection into Louisiana’s campaign galvanized anti-Trump voters who helped push Edwards to victory.</p>
      <p>An attorney and U.S. Army veteran, Edwards became the first Louisiana Democrat to secure consecutive terms since Edwin Edwards in 1976.</p>
      <p>Trump had derided him as a liberal liability in league with Nancy Pelosi.</p>
