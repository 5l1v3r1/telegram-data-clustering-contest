      <h1>Nottingham's political leaders need 'more powers' if city is to thrive</h1>
      <h2>Lord Bob Kerslake is chairing a commission into regional inequalities in the UK</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Bunn</a></address>
      <p>More power should be devolved to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-city-council">Nottingham City Council</a> if the city is to harness its full potential.</p>
      <p>That is the view of the former head of the civil service, Lord Bob Kerslake, who is chairing the UK2070 Commission into inequalities that exist in the UK.</p>
      <p>The apolitical Commission argues that while London is one of Europe's richest and most successful cities, some regions in the country are now among the continent's poorest.</p>
      <p>It argues that without significant investment and devolving more decisions about regional economies to the regions, those inequalities could continue to widen in the future.</p>
      <p>Lord Kerslake told Nottinghamshire Live that measures put in place by governments over the last 50 years have been short-term and insufficient to bridge the gap, labelling them "pea-shooter policies".</p>
      <p>He said: "To me, power in Britain is held at the centre and it needs to devolve so councils like Nottingham can make more decisions locally and also work with other councils to improve the local economy and the wider area.</p>

      <p>"Behind that we need to look at re-establishing a regional structure, in my view. I think there is a good argument to build on what is going on in northern models and in the south as well.</p>
      <p>"I know and love the regional cities in this country. We have not made the most of them and if we can really harness them we will have a better and fairer economy in the UK."</p>
      <p>Lord Kerslake's comments came prior to a visit to Nottingham on Friday, November 15, where he outlined the Commission's research to leaders at the Nottingham City Business Club.</p>
      <p>The crossbench member of the House of Lords stressed investment was still needed in the south, but "new investment" must also go to areas further north.</p>
      <p>Support was offered in the last 18 months by Theresa May's Conservative government for an East Midlands Development Corporation, which can effectively cut through the planning system.</p>
      <p>Funding was provided to investigate how this organisation would operate, with the HS2 hub at Toton, the SEGRO Logistics Park, near East Midlands Airport and East Midlands Airport itself being highlighted as some major growth opportunities for the wider East Midlands.</p>
      <p>Lord Kerslake is supportive of measures to increase growth in regions, but in relation to this example, he added: "Fundamentally, I would like to see the devolution of power going to democratically-elected councils, like Nottingham, and then the wider area in the first instance."</p>
      <p>The Commission has made several recommendations to rebalance the UK's economy.</p>
      <p>This includes protecting disadvantaged communities most at risk from climate change and use market opportunities which have been created by a move to a zero carbon economy.</p>

      <p>It also calls for better connectivity by renewing and extending out-dated transport infrastructure and reconnect marginalised communities, an issue which has been raised among areas in north Nottinghamshire, some of which do not have direct access to Nottingham itself.</p>
      <p>In addition, it has suggested a regional investment bank network and a change to treasury investment rules so regional variations can be accommodated.</p>
      <p>Lord Kerslake said: "Cities like Nottingham and regions like the East Midlands have real potential to help drive the future growth of the UK economy, and we need a coordinated and consistent strategy that enables them to invest for the long-term and gather sustained momentum."</p>
      <p>He has admitted redressing the imbalance among the UK's regional cities will mean "radical policy changes", but stated the potential benefits could be huge.</p>
      <p>"There is a lot going on in Nottingham and it has a lot going for it as a city," Lord Kerslake added. "There is a massive potential to be harnessed."</p>
      <p>Responding to the comments, Councillor David Mellen, leader of Nottingham City Council, said: "Now more than ever there is a need for the gap between the north and south to be closed - and giving greater powers and funding to councils who know their communities and local needs best could reap significant rewards.</p>
      <p>“Our Metro Strategy with Derby and the wider Midlands Engine partnership (the region's answer to the Northern Powerhouse) are helping us to work together on regional issues such as large infrastructure projects, to achieve collectively what is best for the people who live and work here.</p>
      <p>"But Government needs to listen more, share funding more fairly across the country and then let us get on with delivering schemes that will not only benefit this region but the whole national economy.”</p>
