        <b>The upcoming episode of Bigg Boss 13 is going to be an entertaining one as the male contestant go through waxing as a part of a task. In the promo, Sidharth Shukla can be seen telling Salman Khan that he has a question for Rashami and he asks if she loves Sidharth Shukla</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you follow the controversial reality show Bigg Boss 13, you must be aware of the constant fights between Sidharth Shukla and Rashami Desai. The two are often seen in heated arguments and at loggerheads with each other almost every other day, and it has become a hot topic of conversation in the BB house. Now, Weekend ka Vaar is here, and Salman Khan is all set to make the upcoming episode much more interesting. The recent promo shows Sidharth Shukla asking if Rashami loves him, and we’re not sure if we heard him correctly.</p>
      <p>The recent promo of tonight’s Weekend Ka Vaar episode with Salman Khan shows the male contestants of the show Paras Chhabra, Hindustani Bhau and others getting their legs waxed by the female contestants after every question. The video shows the guys screaming and yelling in pain, while others enjoy it. At the end of the promo, we can see Sidharth Shukla telling Salman Khan that he has a question. He later points and says, “Kya aap Sidharth Shukla se pyaar karti hain?” immediately followed by Paras Chhabra being blown by the question and Rashami’s wide-eyed expression. While the promo doesn’t clearly show who Sidharth has asked this question to, we can only assume it’s Rashami Desai, given her shocked expression. <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-arti-singh-s-brother-krushna-abhishek-calls-sidharth-shukla-muhfat-like-kashmera-shah/5dd0ceee87fb571eff7e3f6b">ALSO READ: Bigg Boss 13: Arti Singh’s Brother Krushna Abhishek Calls Sidharth Shukla ‘Muhfat’ Like Kashmera Shah</a></p>
