      <p>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka’s ruling party presidential candidate has conceded defeat to rival Gotabaya Rajapaksa in the Indian Ocean island nation’s election.</p>
      <p>Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa says in a statement he will “honour the decision of the people” in polls Saturday favouring Rajapaksa, the civil war-era defence secretary who served under his brother, ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa.</p>
      <p>Rajapaksa spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella described the win as a “people’s victory.”</p>
      <p>Rajapaksa reached the threshold for victory of 50% plus one vote by Sunday morning, with most of Premadasa’s electoral strongholds counted.</p>
      <p>Sri Lanka’s Election Commission says that while gunmen had fired at a convoy of buses carrying Muslim voters in the country’s north hours before polling stations opened, the vote was largely peaceful.</p>
