        <i>UPDATE: The Cascade bushfire has been downgraded to a bushfire advice for parts of Cascade in the Shire of Esperance.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The Department of Fire and Emergency Services issued a bushfire advice for people in an area bounded by West Point Road, Clare Road and River Road in Cascade in the Shire of Esperance.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The alert level for this fire has been downgraded as conditions have eased and the fire is under control.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>There is no threat to lives or homes.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Although there is no immediate danger you need to be aware and keep up to date in case the situation changes.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Firefighters are actively fighting the fire and strengthening containment lines with 40 Pastoralists and 30 Bush Fire Service firefighters in attendance.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The bushfire is moving slowly in a north easterly direction and is controlled but not contained.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>People in the area are advised to stay alert, monitor their surroundings and watch for signs of a bushfire, especially smoke and flames.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Department of Fire and Emergency Services issued a Bushfire Watch and Act for parts of Cascade in the Shire of Esperance after a bushfire was reported at 12.18pm on Sunday, November 17.</p>
      <p>A bushfire Watch and Act has been issued for people in an area bounded by West Point Road, Clare Road and River Road in Cascade in Shire of Esperance.</p>
      <p>Firefighters are on the scene, actively fighting the fire that has burned through 600 hectares.</p>
      <p>Seventy Bush Fire Service and Pastoralists firefighters are attending and aerial support has been sent to assist ground crews.</p>
      <p>DFES have advised there is a possible threat to lives and homes as a fire is approaching in the area and conditions are changing.</p>
      <p>The bushfire is moving fast in a north easterly direction and is out of control and unpredictable.</p>
      <p>The fire started near the intersection of River Road and Cascade Road in Cascade.</p>
      <p>People in the area are advised to leave or prepare to actively defend.</p>
      <p>Those who plan to stay and actively defend, are advised to not rely on mains water pressure as it may be affected. Those who have access to a water tank and plan to defend their home, are advised to start patrolling with their hose and put out spot fires.</p>
      <p>Residents who are not prepared or plan to leave are advised to leave now if the way is clear.</p>
      <p>Those who are well prepared and plan to actively defend their home are advised to make final preparations now.</p>
      <p>If residents are not home they are advised to not return, as conditions in the area could be very dangerous.</p>
      <p>People are advised to close all doors and windows and turn off evaporative air conditioners, but keep water running through the system if possible.</p>
      <p>Roads have not been closed.</p>
      <p>Motorists are asked to avoid the area, reduce speed and drive carefully due to smoke.</p>
      <p>Road information may also be available from Main Roads WA by calling 138 138 or visiting <a href="https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/">www.mainroads.wa.gov.au</a> or Shire of Esperance.</p>
      <p>DFES advises to never fly a drone, model aircraft or multirotor near bushfires. Doing so poses a major safety risk to firefighting personnel in the air and on the ground, and forces aircraft to be grounded or redirected, hindering firefighting efforts.</p>
      <p>The Shire of Esperance is managing the fire.</p>
