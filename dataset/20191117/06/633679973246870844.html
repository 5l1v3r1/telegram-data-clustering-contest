      <p>The carcasses of a rhino, her calf, and a zebra were found in the City of Tshwaneâ€™s Rietvlei Nature Reserve on Saturday, after the animals were electrocuted during the collapse of an Eskom electricity pylon in the park.</p>
      <p>Mayoral committee member for environment and agriculture management, Dana Wannenburg says the tragedy struck on Friday evening, and the animals were found during a routine patrol on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He said it was unknown what caused the collapse of the wooden pylons, but Eskom technicians were on-site to repair it and secure the overhead cables.</p>
      <p>Wannenburg said Tshwane's nature conversation officials would work closely with Eskom officials to establish the cause of the collapse, check the soundness of all other structures along this overhead line, and to determine which measures could be implemented to safeguard the reserve's wildlife from further harm.</p>
