        <b>Alex Neil says the strong squad spirit and discipline within the Preston North End dressing room is driven by the players.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The tight-knit nature of the PNE squad is often cited as being a big factor in results on the pitch.</p>

      <p>North End manager Neil believes the players deserve a lot of the credit for that.</p>
      <p>“There are rules here and we have a code of conduct, a lot of that is driven by the players,” said Neil.</p>
      <p>“They are self-sufficient on that front you could say.</p>
      <p>“There is stuff which needs to be brought to the manager’s door but most of it is led by them and they do that really well.</p>
      <p>“The balance is right, it is all done properly.</p>
      <p>“The simple fact is that whatever I take off the players in fines, when it comes to Christmas I give it back to them and say ‘Go off and have a good time’!</p>
      <p>“Most of the time the lads will fine each other for things, they’ve got the rules about being on time and what to wear for matches.”</p>
      <p>While Neil lets his players self-police, he has a strong bond with the squad.</p>
      <p>That bond and level of respect is something he thinks goes a long way.</p>
      <p>Neil said: “There has got to be respect between the squad and manager.</p>
      <p>“It can be a tough time for players who haven’t played as much as they would have liked.</p>
      <p>“I think it is important how you get dealt with as a player and the conversations you have with the manager.</p>
      <p>“Our squad is made up of players who at any given time I can put in or take out of the team without altering the way we play.</p>
      <p>“Anyone is capable of going into the team and making an impact. It is important that all the players understand that.</p>
      <p>“You have to treat players with respect, you are speaking to them as men, not as kids.”</p>
      <p>The international break has afforded Neil the chance to refresh the squad.</p>
      <p>They had a couple of days off after he Huddersfield win before returning to training.</p>
      <p>There was a long weekend off for them but it is business as usual from Monday in the build-up to the visit to Derby.</p>
      <p>Sean Maguire and Alan Browne will rejoin the squad on Thursday after being on international duty with the Republic of Ireland.</p>
      <p>Both started last Thursday 3-1 friendly win over New Zealand with Maguire scoring.</p>
      <p>On Monday night, the Republic of Ireland meet Denmark in Dublin in a must-win Euro 2020 qualifier.</p>
