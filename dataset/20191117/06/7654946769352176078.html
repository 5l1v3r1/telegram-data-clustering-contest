      <h1>Prince Andrew mocked online for calling Jeffrey Epstein’s pedophile attacks ‘unbecoming’</h1>

      <p>In arguably his most striking gaffe in Saturday’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/prince-andrew-claims-he-doesnt-recall-meeting-alleged-teen-sex-slave/">bizarre BBC interview</a>, Prince Andrew claimed that his onetime pal, pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, “quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming.”</p>
      <p>The word choice prompted his interviewer to snap back, “Unbecoming? He was a sex offender!”</p>
      <p>The foot-in-royal-mouth moment came toward the end of his hour-long sitdown with BBC journalist Emily Maitlis.</p>
      <p>She was asking Andrew whether he had any regrets over his friendship with Epstein.</p>
      <p>One of Epstein’s young “sex slaves,” Virginia Giuffre, has accused Epstein of three times trafficking her to the royal when she was just 17 and 18 years old; a photo of Andrew with his arm around the teen has also dunned him in recent years.</p>
      <p>“Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming — yes,” Andrew answered Maitlis.</p>
      <p>The reporter looked almost aghast as protested “He was a sex offender!”</p>
      <p>Andrew struggled to recover, stammering, “Yeah, I’m sorry.”</p>
      <p>He quickly added, “I’m being polite, in the sense that he <i>was</i> a sex offender.”</p>
      <p>Twitter quickly hated on the gaffe, with critics weighing in on #unbecoming.</p>
      <p>“#unbecoming has to be the new # for absolutely horrific behaviour. I punched a kitten #unbecoming of #PrinceAndrew,” <a href="https://twitter.com/nameoftheweeman/status/1195827989713436672?s=20">tweeted “L copeland.”</a></p>
      <p>The hashtag #NoSweat, also circulated — a reference to Andrew’s claim earlier in the BBC interview that Giuffre couldn’t possibly have complained that he was a “sweaty” dancer back in 2001.<br/>“Because I have a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-says-he-couldnt-sweat-in-attempt-to-debunk-epstein-accusers-claim/?_ga=2.199189231.1342695103.1573792382-1888725328.1549379088">peculiar medical condition</a>,” Andrew “explained.”</p>
      <p>“Which is that I don’t sweat, or I didn’t sweat at the time . . . because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at. And I simply — it was, it was almost impossible for me to sweat.”</p>
      <p>Other mocking hashtags were #ForAMan and #pizzaexpress.</p>
      <p>In another weird denial of ever having even met Giuffre, Andrew had claimed that he would have remembered having sex with her because he’s male.</p>
      <p>“Without putting too fine a point on it,” he argued, “If you’re a man, it is a positive act to have sex with somebody. “You have to take some sort of positive action and so therefore if you forget it’s very difficult to try and forget a positive action and I do not remember anything.”</p>
      <p>The #pizzaexpress hashtag came in response to his claim that on the first night Giuffre claims she was trafficked to him, in 2001, he was actually at home with the kids — a night he remembers because he took Princess Beatrice to “the Pizza Express in Woking.”</p>
      <p>“I remember it weirdly, distinctly,” he insisted.</p>
