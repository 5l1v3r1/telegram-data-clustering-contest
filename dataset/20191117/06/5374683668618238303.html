      <h2>Senior Turkish defense official downplays US threat of sanctions over his country's purchase of anti-missile system from Russia.</h2>

      <p>Turkey will use the S-400 missile defense system it has bought from Russia despite the US threat of sanctions, a senior defense official said Saturday, according to <i>AFP</i>.</p>
      <p>Ankara and Washington have been at loggerheads over Turkey’s purchase of the S-400 system, which the United States says is not compatible with NATO defenses and poses a threat to Lockheed Martin’s F-35 “stealth” fighter jet.</p>
      <p>The first parts of the S-400 air defense system <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/265904">were delivered to Turkey</a> in July. Russia then delivered <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/267961">a second battery</a> of S-400s in August.</p>
      <p>US has threatened Turkey with sanctions, but said it would be spared from these measures under a 2017 law if the S-400 system is not turned on.</p>
      <p>"It is not a correct approach to say 'we will not use for someone else's sake' a system we had purchased out of our need and we paid that amount of money," Ismail Demir, the head of the Defense Industry Directorate, a government body, told private <i>CNN Turk</i> broadcaster on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"We will do our duty and (the system) will become usable. How it will be used is a decision to be made later," he added.</p>
      <p>"We should respect the agreement we signed and that's what suits us as a country."</p>
      <p>The issue was raised in talks in Washington this week between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and US President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Trump said that Turkey's controversial acquisition created "serious challenges" for Washington as he added officials would "immediately" get to work on resolving the issue.</p>
      <p>Washington reacted to Turkey's purchase of the S-400 <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/266129">by removing the country</a> off its F-35 fighter jet program.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/261455">Turkish officials insist</a> that the deal to purchase the S-400 does not affect the security of the US and have repeatedly stressed that they will go ahead with the deal despite Washington’s objections.</p>
