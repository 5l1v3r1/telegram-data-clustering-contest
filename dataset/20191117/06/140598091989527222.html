      <p>This stunning cheesecake looks considerably more taxing than it actually is, and the result is as just good to eat.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time:</b><b> </b><b>25</b> minutes, plus chilling | <b>Cooking time: </b>1 hour, 10 minutes </p>
      <h3>MAKES </h3>
      <p>One 24cm cheesecake</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <p>
        <b>For the base</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>75g butter, plus extra for greasing</li>
        <li>175g digestive biscuits</li>
        <li>1½ tsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 generous pinch of salt</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>For the filling</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>250g mixed fresh or frozen berries, thawed</li>
        <li>500g cream cheese</li>
        <li>200g low-fat quark or Greek-style yogurt</li>
        <li>185g caster sugar</li>
        <li>1½ tbsp vanilla sugar</li>
        <li>30g cornflour</li>
        <li>1½ tsp grated lemon zest and 1 tbsp juice</li>
        <li>175ml single cream</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>For the sauce</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tsp cornflour</li>
        <li>About 1 tbsp honey</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/160C fan/Gas 4. Carefully line a 24cm springform tin with baking paper and butter the side.</li>
        <li>For the base, melt the butter in a small saucepan. Put the biscuits in a resealable plastic bag and finely crush with a rolling pin. Thoroughly combine the biscuit crumbs with the melted butter, brown sugar and salt. Press the biscuit mixture into the tin evenly and firmly and bake for 8-10 minutes. Set aside to cool. Reduce the oven to 160C/140C fan/Gas 3.</li>
        <li>Blend the berries and strain them through a fine sieve. Remove about 2 tablespoons for marbling and refrigerate the rest for the sauce.</li>
        <li>Mix the cream cheese and quark together until smooth. Whisk in the sugar, vanilla sugar and cornflour. Stir in the lemon zest and juice, then quickly whisk in the cream, eggs and egg yolk, mixing until everything is well combined. Do not overmix to prevent bubbles from forming when baking. Spread the filling evenly over the base. Dot the top with the 2 tablespoons blended berries. Pull a fork through the berries to create a marbled effect.</li>
        <li>Bake the cheesecake for about 45 minutes. Do not open the oven door during cooking, or the surface will crack. When the cheesecake is cooked, switch off the oven and leave the cake to cool. Leave the oven door closed for the first 30 minutes, then open the door slightly and leave to cool for another 1½ hours. Remove the cheesecake from the oven, set aside to cool completely, then refrigerate for at least 6 hours.</li>
        <li>Before serving, carefully slide a sharp knife around the cake edge. Remove the cheesecake from the tin and transfer to a serving plate. Bring the remaining strained berries to the boil in a small saucepan. Dissolve the cornflour in a little cold water. Whisk into the fruit and simmer for 1–2 minutes, stirring, to thicken. Sweeten with honey. Serve the berry coulis with the cheesecake.</li>
