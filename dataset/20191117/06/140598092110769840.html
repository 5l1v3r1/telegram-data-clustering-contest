      <h1>Kathryn Flett reviews Henry &amp; Joe's, Berkshire: 'An unpretentious life-enhancing, cockle-warming gaff' </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/kathryn-flett/" target="_blank">Kathryn Flett</a></address>
      <p>After a three-hour drive to Newbury, Berkshire, on a November Saturday afternoon, I exited the car in an al fresco NCP corral at the mercy of frankly apocalyptic rain, coupled with a wind so biting its own teeth were chattering. I was soaked through to my smalls in seconds.</p>
      <p>This was a recipe for the drowning-of-pre-drowned sorrows, PDQ. Lacking a sprauncy-looking boutique hotel with deep-pile focaccia, millefeuille bed linen and cocktails in glasses the size of Premier League trophies, under extreme weather-siege we prepared to compromise on Henry &amp; Joe’s – which, I prayed, had robust central heating and a decent cellar. Have sorrows, will drown.</p>
      <p>H&amp;J’s is two years old this very month, and quite the toast of Newbury, at least if <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/comment/is-tripadvisors-influence-waning/">TripAdvisor</a> is your guide. Henry is in the kitchen and Joe is front of house, and praise be I’d had the foresight to book online – because it is a tiny joint.</p>
      <p>Ducking through the door a young man who I assumed was Joe greeted me with “Kathryn! Wow! Gosh, you are wet! Let’s get you out of that coat and seated next to a lovely, warm radiator smartish” – or similarly kindly and mollycoddling words to that effect. Enveloped in Joe’s hospitality duvet, I naturally spent at least three quarters of the next two hours falsely assuming that he knew “who I was” – or at least “why I was here”.</p>
      <p>But no, he didn’t. Eventually, as the small room filled to the brim and our host moved from table to table dispensing good cheer – often squatting on his haunches, nose level with the cutlery, asking earnestly what “you guys” need – I realised Joe was to H&amp;J’s front-of-housery what Mr Tumble is to CBeebies: one without the other is inconceivable, not least because a restaurant called “Henry &amp;” is a bit silly.</p>
      <p>As ever, it’s all about context. Inside a West End venue of chilly faux-swankery, I would not only be horrified if the maître d’ hunkered down next to me to discuss the state of his sourdough, I would probably leave.</p>

      <p>Here in the Thames Valley, on an End-of-Days Saturday, however, it very nearly made me cry with joy. I felt seen, I felt heard, I was this far from going the full Sally-Field-at-the-Academy-Awards. Nonetheless, masking my feelings with haute-critical froideur, I said “thanks” with a tight little smile as we took our table adjacent – blessings! – to a radiator. There was clearly at least one reason why this modest space, with pale grey walls, wood tables and open kitchen – is awash with five-star reviews on TripAdvisor, namely Joe. Henry now had everything to play for.</p>
      <p>At Saturday lunch the menu is set: two courses for £25, three for £30, bread and butter £1.50 per person and sides £4 a pop. It’s a bold choice ordering a chilled first course when you are wet: however I went for swede remoulade, confit egg yolk, soy gel and the local Spenwood cheese; my partner for smoked haddock kedgeree tart with kaffir lime leaf.</p>
      <p>I became immediately fond of the piquant remoulade topped by gelatinous yolk. This centre staging of a vegetable about which nobody ever says “words cannot express how much I love swede” is why I’d ordered it.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, my partner’s tart ranneth over, struggling to contain the smoked haddock. It didn’t matter though because the taste was there; a cosy dish. Our bread was ace, too.</p>
      <p>Relaxing, I requested a large glass of a sunny Chilean chardonnay because I wasn’t driving home, and ordered all the sides – triple-cooked chips with Marmite hollandaise, purple broccoli with peanut and malt crumb and “parsley braised sand carrot” (which sounds like a song from Trumpton) to go with my pork cutlet, braised cheek, salt-baked pineapple, crushed pumpkin and anchovy, and his cod, celeriac, caramelised kohlrabi, black pudding and walnut ketchup.</p>
      <p>I’ve barely eaten pork (and have given up bacon) for months because it feels like one of the most ethically out-of-step-with-our-times meats around – however, this was a lovely smidgen, and the accompanying collapsible flavourful braised cheek was gorgeous, succulent meat and a robust nom-nom reduction.</p>
      <p>All the veg were on form and the flavour pile-up was entirely satisfying. The man opposite was pleased by his double whammy of white fish dishes, topped and tailed with another tart for dessert – this time a crème brûlée with a banana and passionfruit sorbet.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I returned to the creamy Spenwood ewes’ milk cheese with crackers and chutney.</p>
      <p>As we mopped up our crumbs, dry by now and teetering on the brink of “happy”, at the table next to ours a party of four regulars was attempting to book another lunch on a weekday in December. “Sorry,” said Joe, “we’ve no tables for four free in December.”</p>
      <p>Poor Newbury. Turns out the reason Henry and Joe’s is a proper small-scale success story is down to both Joe and Henry, whose unpretentious life-enhancing local properly cockle-warmed a couple of wet and miserable strangers.</p>
      <p>Don’t go out of your way, reader; however, if you’re ever in Newbury do pop in and give them both a hug.</p>
