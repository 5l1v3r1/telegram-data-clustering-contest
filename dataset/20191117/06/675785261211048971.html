      <h1>Jordan Pickford highlights importance of England starting with a win at Euro 2020</h1>
      <h2>The Everton goalkeeper is ­already braced for the hype that will come with being one of next year’s co-host nations</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:03:36+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:03</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Mullock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/simon-mullock/</a></address>
      <p>Jordan Pickford was “still in nappies” when England last staged the Euros.</p>
      <p>But the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> goalkeeper is ­already braced for the hype that will come with being one of next year’s co-host nations – and ­the country staging the tournament final, at Wembley.</p>
      <p>Pickford has established himself as Gareth Southgate’s undisputed No.1 in the 18 months since he went to the World Cup in Russia.</p>
      <p>That’s where he helped the Three Lions reach their first major ­semi-final since the original ­‘Football’s Coming Home’ summer of Euro 96.</p>
      <p>And while time is on the side of Southgate’s young squad, the 25-year-old Pickford has already experienced enough in his career to know that England must do ­everything they can to seize the day next summer.</p>
      <p>Pickford said: “It will be as close to a home tournament as you are going to get without being the sole hosts.</p>

      <p>“So yeah, that will add a bit more to the pressure – but I also think it will add to the enjoyment as well.</p>
      <p>“Being based at St George’s Park, in a home environment, we know what it will be like and it will give us all a great buzz.</p>
      <p>“I was still in nappies in 1996, but I know it will be a great experience because we know how good the fans are. We want to repay them for that support.</p>
      <p>“We know the fans will be right behind us – and they should know that as footballers we all want to be winners for them.</p>
      <p>“We know how hard winning a tournament is. But the first thing we need to do is win the opening game and the fans will all start to believe.</p>

      <p>“During the World Cup, it was quality when we saw how excited the fans were back home.</p>
      <p>“We have made great progress as a team in the last couple of years and losing the semi-final in Russia can hopefully spur us on.”</p>
      <p>It isn’t just the World Cup defeat at the hands of Croatia in 2018 that has made Pickford realise that time is of the essence in football.</p>
      <p>Two weeks ago, he saw Everton team-mate Andre Gomes suffer a horrific injury, as a ­challenge by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> ’s Son Heung-min left the Portuguese midfielder with a fracture and ­dislocation of his ankle.</p>

      <p>It was another example of how the game can be cruel is so many ways.</p>
      <p>Pickford said: “I didn’t really see the extent of the injury because I was at the opposite end of the pitch and I knew that if I went over to have a look I would risk going into shock.</p>
      <p>“I spent most of the time just trying to get the lads to get their focus back on the game because we were losing 1-0. I also tried to help Sonny as well because I don’t think he meant to do it.</p>
      <p>“It’s another example that you never know what football is going to bring. You have to take all your opportunities because you can’t ever take anything for granted.”</p>

      <p>Pickford added: “That’s why I look back on the World Cup with mixed feelings.</p>
      <p>“It was fantastic to be involved. But in the end, not getting to the final was a huge disappointment.</p>
      <p>“I suppose that’s why we are all so hungry to achieve more.</p>
      <p>“We want to improve as ­individuals and as a group – and we want to put smiles on people’s faces.”</p>
