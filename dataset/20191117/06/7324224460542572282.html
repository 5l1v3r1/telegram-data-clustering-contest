      <h2>Liam Keen rates Walsall's players after an impressive victory over Cambridge United.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/liam-keen/" target="_blank">Liam Keen</a></address>
      <p>
        <b>LIAM ROBERTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Liam Roberts had little to do for most of the game, but when called upon he did pull off impressive saves. His distribution was also positive, resulting in an overall solid performance. He did drop the ball from a cross in the second half, but the defenders cleared it.<b> 6</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>SHAY FACEY</b>
      </p>
      <p>Now getting his run in the team, Facey is impressing at both ends of the pitch. He has energy, work-rate and a desire that lasts the full 90 minutes. Defensively he was solid but in attack is where he excelled, creating the first goal with excellent skill. <b>7</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>JAMES CLARKE</b>
      </p>
      <p>The captain's return from injury was a welcome one, with the centre-back putting in a composed performance. He brings a calmness and leadership to the side and didn't put a foot wrong against a very tall, strong and physical Cambridge side. <b>7</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>MAT SADLER</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of Sadler's best games this season, where he stood up and was counted when it mattered. His impressive performance on Tuesday night was carried into this game and he was vocal from the start, instructing younger players around him. He took his goal well too. <b>8</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>CALLUM COCKERILL-MOLLETT</b>
      </p>
      <p>The young defender thoroughly deserved to keep his place in the side after an outstanding showing on Tuesday night. Whether in left-back or in a back three, Cockerill-Mollett seems composed wherever you put him. Another mature display here. <b>7</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>RORY HOLDEN</b>
      </p>
      <p>Holden has come under a lot of criticism throughout Walsall's bad run, but his excellent showing in the EFL Trophy was made even sweeter by an equally impressive display in the league. His confidence is visibly growing and when he's playing well, he creates chances. <b>7</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>LIAM KINSELLA</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite only being 23-years-old, Kinsella finds himself as one of the more senior players in a young midfield. Despite that, he's showing the maturity and experience that the team needs. Against Cambridge he was a terrier in midfield and often won the ball back. <b>8</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>ALFIE BATES</b>
      </p>
      <p>The teenager is proving himself to be a real player. It's hard to believe this is his first season in men's football, but he has some serious talent. He simply pivots in midfield, effortlessly distributing the ball. But when needed, he's not afraid to get stuck into physical challenges. <b>7</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>WES MCDONALD</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Tuesday McDonald was electric for 90 minutes. In this game, he was only that in the second half but it was a stupendous display for 45 minutes. His speed, trickery and skill on the ball is essential to this team. His performance deserved a goal. <b>8</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>CAOLAN LAVERY</b>
      </p>
      <p>Walsall desperately missed Lavery during his time on the treatment table, but they're now benefitting from his return. He's the gel that holds together this attack, making forward runs, linking up his team-mates and proving an excellent goal threat. <b>8</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>JOSH GORDON</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite scoring a hat-trick on Tuesday, this was perhaps Gordon's best all-round performance of the season. He's only 5ft 8ins tall but somehow won every header against giant defenders. His strength and hold-up play is deceiving and he ran himself into the ground. There was some luck about his goal, but players create their own luck. 9</p>
      <p><b>Subs:</b> Gaffney (for Lavery 82) 4, Adebayo (for Gordon 87) 5.</p>
      <p><b>Subs not used:</b> Rose, Norman, Jules, Liddle, Hardy.</p>
