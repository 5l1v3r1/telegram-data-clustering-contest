      <p>The video had left fans wondering Katy’s attitude over not showing the passport despite asking repetitively from the singer and pointed out that whether she would do something similar in her country. One of the social media user noted that in her country she would have reprimanded for ignoring the police request to show documents.</p>
      <p>Another user wrote that it was too pathetic to see passing the security personnel. Also questioned the police’ lenient behaviour for not being strict with her passport.</p>
      <p>International Katy Perry’s Mumbai event at the DY Patil Stadium was turned out to be a huge success. Several fans attended the event in large numbers to watch the performance of Katy Perry and Dua Lipa.
