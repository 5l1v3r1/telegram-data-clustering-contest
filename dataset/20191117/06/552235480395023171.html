      <h2>Scotland got lucky in Nicosia but there are reasons to be cheerful about the options Steve Clarke has at his disposal.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Waddell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>How is it possible to be this rich and this poor at the same time?</p>
      <p>To look at the mesmerising beauty of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-christie">Ryan Christie</a>’s goal then realise when you see the subs’ boards go up the true meaning of skin deep?</p>
      <p>To appreciate the verve and energy and passion of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">John McGinn</a>, listen to him say he’d need to be on crutches to keep him away from a dark blue jersey, yet realise your centre-halves would still struggle to keep weans out of a close?</p>
      <p>To want Steve Clarke to tell charlatans like Matt Ritchie to ram it instead of going cap in hand, yet be so desperate for even one more striker to give you some of what Steven Naismith does that you’d crawl to Sheffield to ask Steven Fletcher to give you one last hurrah?</p>
      <p>It must be what it feels like to be in a loveless marriage.</p>
      <p>To know you’ve committed to it in sickness and in health, better or worse, richer or poorer, and realise all you’re ever destined to get is the thin end of every wedge.</p>

      <p>Welcome to another day in the rest of your angst-ridden wedded life as a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotlands-football-team">Scotland</a> fan.</p>
      <p>Sure, it was a win, the same as the game against them at Hampden back in June was. Barely.</p>
      <p>And maybe it’s the be all and end all right now. Maybe it’s the only way to get any kind of momentum.</p>
      <p>But anyone who turned off their TV, walked out of the pub or trudged the streets of Nicosia, Larnaca or Ayia Napa last night with even a hint of optimism propelling them towards the play-offs in March… Congratulations on your 2019 Glass-Half-Full Award.</p>
      <p>You want to look on the bright side. Of course you do. You want to say that when Andy Robertson and Kieran Tierney and John Souttar and Ryan Fraser and Scott McTominay come back, it’ll all be so much better.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And by definition, it should be. Which of our issues will it solve, though? Because for a while yesterday, it was actually decent. Naismith is a polished operator who knows how to bring his team-mates into the game.</p>
      <p>And when the three you’ve got playing off him are the calibre of James Forrest, Christie and McGinn, you’ve got to believe that’s a good enough set-up.</p>
      <p>Okay, Forrest playing outside in from the left wasn’t at his most effective but the other two were terrific.</p>
      <p>Christie’s goal was reminiscent of the one that kicked it all off for him against Hearts in the League Cup semi a year ago – brilliant technique, opening his body up and caressing it into the top corner with his left foot like an artist flicking his brush with one final flourish on a perfect canvas.</p>

      <p>Since that day, he’s scored 24 in 59 games for club and country, and has made himself absolutely indispensable for both.</p>
      <p>Same as McGinn, who got the assist for that one, then added his own. Five in his last five caps. It’s impossible to imagine a national team without his dynamism now.</p>
      <p>With Callum McGregor, Ryan Jack, McTominay and Fraser in there – if the latter two are ever allowed to leave the EPL’s cryogenic chamber – we’re well fixed.</p>
      <p>Other decent signs? For all Greg Taylor’s lack of football at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a>, Clarke was right – he’ll never let you down, although to be fair he was lucky to see out the game.</p>
      <p>The tackle Southend’s Jason Demetriou put in on him was an absolute shocker – studs down the knee, a straight red every day of the week. For all those positives, though, the cold truth of yesterday’s game was that we could easily have been scudded.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The goal Cyprus “scored” in six minutes was over the line all day long.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the fact Scott McKenna was made to look like an absolute mug on the seat of his pants, how is that allowed to happen in international football these days, that an organisation with the wealth of UEFA can’t have the bare minimum of goal-line technology for their flagship international competition?</p>
      <p>Great that they didn’t, by the way, but even so, Cyprus could have had at least another couple anyway.</p>
      <p>The diving header flying an inch past the post. The penalty Declan Gallacher nearly gave away in the last three minutes, wrapping both his arms around their striker in the box. The late shot flashing over.</p>
      <p>At no point did we look like we were capable of ushering the game to its conclusion and keeping our pulse rate below 140.</p>

      <p>Same at the other end. Again, without the threat of Leigh Griffiths or the nous of Fletcher, as soon as Naismith runs his race and we fling on Oli McBurnie and Oliver Burke, it shows.</p>
      <p>Without reinforcements, yesterday showed that the squad is shallower than Donald Trump’s gene pool.</p>
      <p>Clarke’s not daft, though.</p>
      <p>Maybe if we’d romped it and do likewise on Tuesday night to avenge Kazakhstan’s dismantling of us over there, the manager might have listened to everyone telling him it was time to take a hard line with the likes of Bournemouth and Arsenal, batter them with FIFA’s five-day rule, stop them taking the p***.</p>
      <p>Send out a message.</p>
      <p>After that, though? He’s not going to cut off his nose to spite his face.</p>
