      <h1>Thomas Cook collapse still causing chaos for Scots who booked holidays</h1>
      <h2>Families are facing a fight to recoup the cash they paid to travel firm before it went bust.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">The Judge, http://www.facebook.com/TheScottishDailyRecord/</a></address>
      <p>The collapse of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/former-thomas-cook-travel-agents-20868310">Thomas Cook</a> is still causing chaos for customers two months on.</p>
      <p>The Civil Aviation Authority is handling about 360,000 refunds under the ATOL compensation scheme and aims to pay claims within 60 days.</p>
      <p>But thousands of holiday-makers have no ATOL protection and many of my readers are finding they have a fight on their hands to get their money back in any case.</p>
      <p>Today I feature three customers still reeling from the demise of the UK’s oldest travel agent.</p>
      <p>Calum and Karen Johnstone are out of pocket by £1774 for a cancelled family break to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-familys-dream-holiday-turned-20076843">Malaga.</a></p>
      <p>The couple, both 48 and of ­Stenhousemuir, paid Barrhead Travel by credit card in August.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>They were due to travel to the all-inclusive Marconfort Griego hotel, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-familys-dream-holiday-turned-20076843">in Torremolinos</a>, on October 12 with sons Josh, 16, and Ryan, 13.</p>
      <p>But Thomas Cook went into administration on September 23, owing £200million.</p>
      <p>Calum, a foreman, said: “As we’d booked with ­Barrhead Travel, I thought the holiday was safe. How wrong I was.”</p>
      <p>He checked the paperwork, noticed it was a Thomas Cook holiday and social care worker Karen went to a branch and waited three hours to be seen.</p>
      <p>Calum said: “They told her the holiday was lost and if we wanted to rebook, we’d have to pay again.</p>
      <p>“We couldn’t afford that and it was heartbreaking to have to tell the kids.”</p>
      <p>The Johnstones were told to expect an email within two days with details of how to claim their money back. Calum said: “A week later, we went to the shop again.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>“They dropped the bombshell – we were on our own and would have to claim via the CAA.”</p>
      <p>Calum contacted their credit card company, Halifax, but it too referred him to the CAA.</p>
      <p>John and Mary Watson, of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/cowdenbeath-fc">Cowdenbeath</a>, are £1120 down for flights to Barbados.</p>
      <p>They had a flight-only booking, so no ATOL protection – but they’d used a Nationwide credit card and thought they were safe.</p>
      <p>John booked alternative flights costing £1300 for the three-week holiday to Rockley Beach on the island’s south coast.</p>
      <p>They were relieved when, on October 2, Nationwide said their money had been recovered. But on October 21, it changed its tune.</p>
      <p>John said: “Nationwide said it had reviewed our case and there was no basis for them to settle under the ­Consumer Credit Act as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/former-thomas-cook-travel-agents-20868310">Thomas Cook</a> contracts include a term excluding them from any ­consequential losses.”</p>
      <p>He and Mary, 72, contacted Citizens’ Advice and the ombudsman and called me.'</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>John, 73, said: “I thought paying by credit card gave me insurance protection for this very scenario.”</p>
      <p>Jim and Margaret Cochran lost £303 for deposits and car parking. They had two live bookings for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/thomas-cook-airdrie-coatbridge-jobs-20544502">Thomas Cook</a> holidays to ­Tenerife – for January and May – when it collapsed.</p>
      <p>They were paying for the first break monthly and were delighted when ATOL announced that direct debit customers would be automatically refunded.</p>
      <p>But the couple, of Hamilton, are still out of pocket for deposits of £200 for the holidays and £103.59 for parking with Holiday Extras, both paid by debit card.</p>
      <p>Jim, 67, said: “I’ve tried to get the money back but have been told it is non-refundable. Could you please help?”</p>
      <p>The good news is Nationwide paid up for John and offered a goodwill gesture, Halifax and Barrhead Travel are on the case for Calum and Holiday Extras has refunded Jim.</p>
      <p>Barrhead Travel said: ­“Information was changing day to day which is why differing advice was given. We are ­working hard to help customers.”</p>
      <p>Halifax said: “Mr ­Johnstone booked his holiday through a third party, part of which <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/thomas-cook-airdrie-coatbridge-jobs-20544502">included flights with Thomas Cook.</a></p>
      <p>“We advised him to seek a refund through the third party but are available if he’d would like to claim under s75.”</p>
      <p>The CAA asked people who hadn’t yet claimed to do so direct via its website.</p>
      <p>It added: “The validation ­process is well under way.”</p>
      <p>But consumer law specialist Frank Johnstone, of Brodies LLP, said credit card customers should contact their banks.</p>
      <p>He added: “There is nothing to prevent consumers claiming via ATOL and their credit card granter at the same time to see which one comes good, but they must not recover their loss twice.”</p>
