      <h2>Sasha-Leigh Salkeld issued a plea to motorists ahead of the Christmas party season</h2>

      <p>A girl of 10 whose dad was killed by a drink-driver when she was just a baby has hit out at “selfish” motorists who get behind the wheel while under the influence.</p>
      <p>Sasha-Leigh Salkeld issued a plea to motorists ahead of the Christmas party season as she made the heartbreaking admission: “It’s not the same without daddy.”</p>
      <p>Speaking in the company of her mother Kate Flynn, brave Sasha – who was five months old when her 26-year-old dad Lee was killed – urged people to think twice.</p>
      <p>She told the Irish Sunday Mirror: “I’ve had a happy life, but without him there’s a piece of me that is sad because I miss him so much.</p>

      <p>“We could have created so many good and happy memories together. I look at photos of him but it’s not the same.</p>
      <p>“Pals in school talk about what they did with their dad and what memories they made. I can’t make any memories.</p>
      <p>“I can’t tell them what I did for Father’s Day. I just tell them I set off a lantern as usual, as I do every other Father’s Day.”</p>
      <p>Lee was killed along with his friend Brendan Donnelly, 24, after a head-on collision with a drunk driver as they were on their way to the airport in Cork in October 2006.</p>
      <p>Sasha’s mum Kate was seriously injured in the crash.</p>
      <p>In 2010, Anthony Long, the driver of the other car, was jailed for five years and given a 15-year road ban.</p>

      <p>The court heard the 28-year-old was driving on the wrong side of the road “like a bat out of hell” after downing 11 beers at home followed by seven pints, two vodkas, three shots and a line of cocaine in a pub.</p>
      <p>Sasha, from Waterford, said she had decided to speak out because she does not want any other child to lose a parent the way she did.</p>
      <p>She added: “I just want it to stop because it is a disgraceful, horrible thing. It can affect so many people’s lives...and it is something that can be avoided.</p>
      <p>“Just leave your keys at home and get a taxi, that is what they can do. People who go drink-driving, they know they will hurt somebody.</p>
      <p>“I would love so much to have brothers and sisters. It breaks my heart that I can’t have one.”</p>
      <p>Lee and Kate were heading on holidays with Brendan and his girlfriend Laura Connelly on the night of the tragic crash. Kate added: “We were engaged, planning to be married. We planned to have kids. That was taken away.</p>
      <p>“There’ll never be anyone as good as her dad. No one will ever replace him.</p>

      <p>“All he ever wanted was a family, his little girl was his world. It was amazing how he took to her. People say you don’t know what you’ve got until it’s gone, but we knew what we had. We were happy with the simple things, we had our family and our home.”</p>
      <p>Kate and Sasha mark the anniversary of Lee’s death on October 26 each year and today they will attend a service in Waterford to mark World Day Of Remembrance For Road Traffic Victims. Families who have lost loved ones light candles and remember those killed on the nation’s roads.</p>
      <p>When Sasha first started to ask about what happened to her dad, she asked if Long had said sorry for what he had done.</p>
      <p>Kate told her he had and she immediately said they needed to tell gardai – so he could be let out of prison.</p>
      <p>Sasha said: “I think his children deserve him but he doesn’t deserve his children. He’s a dad, but he took away being a dad from my dad, and that’s not fair.”</p>
      <p>Reliving the horror of the crash, Kate told how she was left fighting for her life with critical injuries sustained in the accident.</p>
      <p>She added: “I broke my neck, the left side of my body was destroyed.</p>

      <p>“I fractured my skull and have epilepsy because of it. But I would take all the pain in the world if it meant Lee was here beside me. He basically died in my arms. Lee, basically he saved my life, he took the brunt of the hit for me.</p>
      <p>“He [Long] didn’t call an ambulance. He ran down a back road so there was less chance of him being seen.</p>
      <p>“It was left for us to climb from the car and call for help.</p>
      <p>“I thank God Sasha wasn’t in the car – it was our first time to leave her since she had been born. He wasn’t even thinking about his own children, why would he think about my daughter? I don’t know if he ever thinks of her or if she enters his mind.</p>
      <p>“There is the reality, there’s a 10-year-old who didn’t see her father on her Communion day, who won’t see him on her Confirmation.</p>

      <p>“He won’t get to walk her down the aisle and see his first grandchild.”</p>
      <p>Kate said having her daughter is a comfort but admits they struggle to get over the loss of Lee. She added: “She’s old enough now to understand and she wants to do something about it. Talking about it is her idea.”</p>
      <p>And Sasha said anyone who drives under the influence is “really selfish”, adding: “If this stops one person and one death then it’s worth it. My dad will know about it, and it will make him proud.”</p>
