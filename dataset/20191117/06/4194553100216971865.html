      <h1>“Strong enough” – John Barnes doesn’t expect much from Liverpool this January</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:20:44+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool legend John Barnes doesn’t expect his former club to be busy this January transfer window, as the Reds don’t look particularly short in any area.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp has guided his side to eight points clear at the top of the Premier League table – nine points ahead of the reigning champions.</p>
      <p>And it’s the form of this team that has Barnes thinking it’ll be a quiet winter transfer window for Liverpool, even with rumours of Ryan Fraser, Timo Werner and Jadon Sancho rife.</p>
      <p>The latter of the trio would be most likely to wait for a the summer to make a move, to be fair, and even then is unlikely to opt for Anfield where he’d warm the bench.</p>
      <p>But Barnes wouldn’t care anyway, because he believes the Reds already have everything they need. “<b>I think we’ve got a squad that’s strong enough,</b>” <a href="https://www.thesportreview.com/2019/11/liverpool-fc-news-john-barnes-january-transfers/">he told The Sport Review</a>.</p>
      <p>“<b>Unless there’s a player who’s going to come into the first team, to replace someone in the first team and make us stronger, why buy a player just to be in the squad when we’ve got lots of squad players?</b></p>
      <p>“<b>So I don’t necessarily think that we’re going to be that active in the January transfer window. Particularly as Liverpool are not a team like Man City who will look to cover every position with an international player.</b>”</p>
      <p>I’m not sure what City are doing can be looked at as a negative, when they’ve had so much success, but I’m reading that as a compliment for Klopp – in effect saying that the German would rather coach his players than bring in a £50million player in every squad position.</p>
