      <p>The Youth Congress workers had a scuffle with the police on Saturday during a counter rally they had organised against <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> demonstration outside their party headquarters in Kolkata on Rafale issue. As many as 26 Congress supporters were arrested in this connection, police said.</p>
      <p>The Youth Congress workers protested against the BJP’s demand of an apology from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi after the Supreme Court had dismissed Rafale review petitions. They also protested the withdrawal of SPG cover to Congress leaders <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sonia-gandhi">Sonia Gandhi</a>, Rahul Gandhi and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/priyanka-gandhi/">Priyanka Gandhi</a>.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) supporters took out the rally from Moulali to Bidhan Bhawan in Central Kolkata and raised slogans against the Congress. They even burnt effigies of Rahul as a mark of protest.<br/>Later in the afternoon, the Congress supporters too burnt Prime Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/narendra-modi">Narendra Modi</a>’s effigy.</p>
      <p>According to police sources, they only intervened when the Congress supporters tried to move close to the BJP office. The Congress supporters also blocked road at Central Avenue and some protesters even threw eggs and ink on police officers. Later, police arrested 26 Congress workers from the spot.</p>
      <p>Following the incident, state Congress president Somen Mitra said, “Such politics of targeting party headquarters never happened in Bengal. They barged into the Bidhan Bhawan and tried to ransack it. Such culture never existed.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the BJP claimed that their protest against Congress was a scheduled programme. BJP state secretary Sayantan Basu said, “Our protest was announced before. But Congress workers came near our party headquarters and I have heard that they also threw something towards the party office. This is unwarranted.”</p>
