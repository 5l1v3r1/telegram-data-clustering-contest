      <p>Mexico City - <b>Harris English</b> closed with back-to-back birdies, the last of them a 25-foot chip-in to seize a one-stroke lead after Saturday's second round of the PGA Mayakoba Classic.</p>
      <p>English fired a bogey-free seven-under par 64 at Playa del Carmen, Mexico, to stand on 13-under 129 after 36 holes with Vaughn Taylor second on 130 and Brendon Todd another stroke adrift.</p>
      <p>"Might have missed two greens today," English said. "Just hit it well. Iron game was on. Wedge game was on and I got hot with the putter a little bit. It was awesome.</p>
      <p>"I feel like if I keep playing like this, I'm in a good spot."</p>
      <p>All play Thursday was washed out by rain so those making the cut will try to complete 36 holes on Sunday but are faced with a likely Monday finish.</p>
      <p>English seeks his third tour title and the first since he won the 2013 Mayakoba Classic by four strokes over compatriot Brian Stuard.</p>
      <p>The American has produced three top-six finishes in four starts during the beginning of the 2019-20 USPGA campaign, sharing third at the Greenbrier and sixth at the Sanderson Farms Championship in September and fourth at last month's Houston Open.</p>
      <p>English made three birdies in a row between the second and fourth holes, added another at the sixth and began the back nine with another at the par-3 10th.</p>
      <p>That set the stage for his closing birdies at 17 and 18, the latter from just off the green.</p>
      <p>"I was just trying to shove it up there close and it went in," English said. "When you get one to go in like that, it's icing on the cake."</p>
      <p>New Zealand's Danny Lee, who opened with a 62 for the 18-hole lead, was sharing fourth on 132 with Adam Long and Robby Shelton.</p>
