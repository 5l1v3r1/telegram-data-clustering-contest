      <p>Belgium secured top spot in Euro 2020 qualifying Group I and stretched their perfect record to nine wins after a sparkling 4-1 win in Russia on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Two goals from Eden Hazard and one by his brother Thorgan inspired them to victory against home side Russia.</p>
      <p>With one round of games remaining, Belgium have a maximum 27 points and second-placed Russia 21, both sides having booked their places at next year’s 24-nation tournament.</p>
      <p>Although there was only pride to play for, the game got off to a pacy start and Thorgan Hazard fired the visitors ahead with a superb 19th-minute goal.</p>
      <p>Eden Hazard made it 2-0 in the 33rd with another fine effort, volleying a low drive past Russia’s Brazilian-born goalkeeper Guilherme after striker Romelu Lukaku headed a lofted pass into his captain’s stride.</p>
      <p>The livewire forward doubled his tally shortly before halftime from a brilliant move, with midfielder Kevin De Bruyne squaring the ball unselfishly for Hazard to stroke into an empty net from 12 metres.</p>
      <p>Only poor finishing by Lukaku and two good saves by Guilherme denied the Belgians a bigger lead in the opening hour as Russia failed to create anything in front of a partisan home crowd.</p>
      <p>Ruthless Belgium struck again in the 72nd minute as Lukaku made amends for his early miss, rifling a scorcher inside the near post from 16 metres with Guilherme clutching nothing but thin air.<br/>Georgi Dzhikiya finally gave the subdued home fans something to cheer about when he swept home a close-range rebound in the 79th.</p>
      <p>It was however scant consolation for a crushing defeat by last year’s World Cup semi-finalists.</p>
