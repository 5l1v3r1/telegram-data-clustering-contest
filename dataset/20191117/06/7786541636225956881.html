      <p>"Salmonella can affect animals eating the products and there is risk to humans from handling contaminated pet products, especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after having contact with the products or any surfaces exposed to these products," the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/go-raw-llc-recalls-one-lot-quest-beef-because-possible-salmonella-health-risk">US Food and Drug Administration</a> <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/cat-food-recalled-due-possible-salmonella-contamination/wJ9mhHwskBUhtaY4DNPzaJ/">said</a>.</p>
      <p>No illnesses <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/cat-food-recalled-due-possible-salmonella-contamination/wJ9mhHwskBUhtaY4DNPzaJ/">have been reported</a>, and the cat food can be identified with the following UPC 6-91730-17101-8, Lot N128. </p>
      <p>The recall was released when the Minnesota Department of Agriculture tested the product and a sample came back positive for salmonella. The pet-food company did conduct their own test that came back negative. </p>
