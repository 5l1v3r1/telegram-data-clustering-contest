      <h1>Mick McCarthy hunting for Denmark scalp tomorrow - rather than another shirt</h1>
      <h2>Ireland are a win away from securing automatic qualification to next summer’s showpiece</h2>

      <p>Mick McCarthy was clearing out his garage last week when he found an old Danish jersey stuffed away in a cardboard box. <br/><br/>“I’ve got all the shirts and I’ve a few good ones in there,” said the manager who made his competitive international debut as a player against the Danes. <br/><br/>That was a 3-0 World Cup qualifying defeat in Copenhagen against a star-studded side boating Preben Elkjaer, Michael Laudrup, Soren Lerby and Mortel Olsen. <br/><br/>“When you’re out of work, you jet-wash the jet-washer. I’ve done that so many times. <br/>But I was clearing the garage and I started looking. <br/><br/>“Hagi’s was still moving about in the box! <br/><br/>But tomorrow night at Aviva Stadium, McCarthy is hunting a Danish scalp rather than another shirt. <br/><br/>“I’ve not lost the passion to win. Not at all,” he said. <br/><br/>“Certain things I’ve mellowed at and have a different perspective towards, but not football, not competing.” <br/><br/>Ireland are a win away from securing automatic qualification to next summer’s showpiece.</p>

      <p>Easier said than done when you haven’t looked in any way convincing in your last two competitive games. <br/><br/>But McCarthy claims the second-half performance against Switzerland in Geneva does offer signs of encouragement. <br/><br/>Thursday’s win over New Zealand has no bearing on tomorrow night as it was a second string team. <br/><br/>Denmark need only a point to advance and while they could adopt a more patient approach because of it, McCarthy insists it won’t change his mindset. <br/><br/>“We’ve got to beat them,” he said. “Will they come here and try and shut up shop? I can’t see that. <br/><br/>“If it’s 0-0 with 15 minutes to go, that’s not a bad scenario. Would I rather be two goals up, yes. Is that likely? Maybe not. <br/><br/>“We’ve only scored six goals so far but if we’re on top with 15 minutes to go, I’d fancy us to win <br/><br/>“We haven't scored that many but a clean sheet is going to be really bloody helpful for us to win a game. <br/><br/>“And we're not going to try and sit back. We haven't done that in any game. <br/><br/>“There’s a difference between defending, sitting back and letting them have the ball - a big difference.” <br/><br/>Acknowledging that Ireland will need to find an extra 5% from somewhere, he added: <br/>“A bit of magic, a slip by somebody else or a free kick, a corner, who knows? <br/><br/>“We have to make sure we play as well as we possibly can. Because if we don’t we’ll get beat and we won’t win it.”</p>
