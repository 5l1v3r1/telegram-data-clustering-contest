      <h3>Olushola Victor</h3>
      <p>Apart from the merriment that comes with a birthday celebration, it is a time to reflect on life and things one could have done better. A Lagos-based industrialist, Anthony Ajulo, who marked his 40th birthday last weekend, has some strong desires.</p>
      <p>He stated: “Going forward, my dream is to further contribute my quota to making Nigeria a great nation. I believe my generation has the responsibility to rewrite the history of Africa and if we miss it, then probably Africa has missed it. I’m going to invest in that direction in the next 40 years. I will build industries, influence policies and empower people in any way I can to see how we can move our nation forward.”</p>
      <p>The Co-founder and Managing Partner at Colton Group also thanked God for the grace to attain 40 and for the successes he had achieved in the manufacturing sector.</p>
      <p>He added, “To have witnessed 40 years on earth and be young at heart is the grace of God. I’m happy and grateful to God.”</p>
      <p>At the event, which also featured inspirational tributes and worship session, the celebrant showed off some dancing skills. His childhood friend and business partner, Collins Balogun, was also present to celebrate him.</p>
