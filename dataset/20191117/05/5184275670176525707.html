      <p>Sharad Kelkar rose to fame with his role in <i>Goliyon Ki Rasleela: Ram-Leela</i> and the actor himself could not agree more to the fact. Sharad calls the Sanjay Leela Bhansali directorial a gamechanger for him.</p>
      <p>“‘<i>Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela</i>‘ was a gamechanger for me. I think people accepted me from ‘…Ram Leela’. From a TV actor to doing a film, the phase was difficult but I got amazing response through that,” Sharad told IANS.</p>

      <p>Sharad says since the release of the Bhansali film in 2013, the industry has been very kind to him.</p>
      <p>“I kept on doing films after films that’s what I have good relationship with most of the actors and producers and directors with whom I worked and I want to work. The journey has been great I am looking forward to 2020 now there are few more releases happening. The next year is pretty exciting for me,” he added.</p>
      <p>Now Sharad will next be seen in Ajay Devgn’s <i>Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior</i>, where he will be seen playing Chatrapathi Shivaji Maharaj.</p>
