      <h2>Leading UK financial services providers face scrutiny over links to Neil Woodford’s failed empire</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T05:00:03+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Owen Walker</a></address>
      <p>Hedge funds are circling Hargreaves Lansdown and St James’s Place, as two of Britain’s best-known financial services providers are scrutinised for their close association with scandal-hit fund manager Neil Woodford.</p>
      <p>Hargreaves and SJP, which combined act as investment intermediaries for nearly 2m UK savers, are among the most shorted companies in the FTSE 100, meaning that hedge funds and other investors have taken positions to benefit from falls in their share prices.</p>
      <p>Short sellers increased their bets against the pair in the immediate aftermath of the suspension of Mr Woodford’s Equity Income fund in June, and have since raised their negative positions.</p>
      <p>Mr Woodford announced that he was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c9bd2a60-ef13-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901">closing his investment business</a> last month, but attention is turning to the companies that convinced clients to entrust their savings with the once-feted fund manager.</p>
      <p>“Hargreaves has always attracted a degree of short investors, but has generally been strong enough to see them off,” said Paul McGinnis, an analyst at Shore Capital. “The true test of how this plays out in terms of whether their brand is damaged is a long-term issue.”</p>
      <p>Hargreaves, the UK’s biggest fund supermarket, faces a potential class action <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b68f0cfe-f0e6-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901">lawsuit</a> from its clients, many of whom are irate that the company continued to promote Mr Woodford’s fund until it was frozen.</p>
      <p>The intermediary had close to 300,000 of its 1.1m clients invested in Mr Woodford’s funds, while SJP had a £3.5bn segregated investment mandate with Mr Woodford, which it withdrew immediately after Equity Income’s suspension.</p>
      <p>Hedge funds have shorted 7.4 per cent of SJP’s stock, making it the sixth most bet against company in the FTSE 100, according to IHS Markit, the data company. Short positions in Hargreaves are equivalent to 6.2 per cent of its stock, putting it eighth in the FTSE 100 short ranking.</p>
      <p>In the week following Equity Income’s suspension, hedge funds Marshall Wace, Lansdowne Partners and AQR Capital Management increased their short positions in Hargreaves. The trio are still the biggest short sellers in Hargreaves, with AQR holding a 1.2 per cent position and Lansdowne and Marshall Wace each holding 1 per cent, according to disclosures to the Financial Conduct Authority.</p>
      <p>SJP also experienced a rise in short sellers in June. Investors with the biggest negative positions in the company are AQR with 1.4 per cent, BlackRock with 0.5 per cent and Citadel, also with 0.5 per cent.</p>
      <p>Hargreaves’ short sellers have benefited from a 23 per cent fall in its share price since the start of June, while SJP’s share price is little changed over that period.</p>
      <p>Both companies have initially emerged from the Woodford scandal with their businesses <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/92cf6a08-f02c-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901">relatively unscathed</a>. In Hargreaves’ mid-year results in August, chief executive Chris Hill said business flows and service levels had “held up well” since the Equity Income suspension. “The [Woodford issue] is not impacting our ability to run our business day to day,” he said.</p>
      <p>SJP last month reported £2.1bn of net inflows in its third quarter. Barrie Cornes, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the company was relatively immune to episodes like the Woodford affair that could be damaging for rivals.</p>
      <p>“Every now and then things do come out of the woodwork for St Jimmy’s, but the company has worked hard to make sure that clients’ relationships with their advisers are the most important thing,” he said.</p>
      <p>Hargreaves, SJP, Lansdowne and Marshall Wace declined to comment. AQR, BlackRock and Citadel did not respond by time of publication.</p>
