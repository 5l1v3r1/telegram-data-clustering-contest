      <p>However, anyone interested in buying the tower will need to be quick if they want to snap up this unique property offering as the online auction closes at 12noon on Friday, December 13.</p>
      <p>The landmark building is believed to have been built in the 1940s to serve the village. It continued in service until 2008.</p>
      <p>Around five miles from Exeter, the concrete tower stands at around 16.12m high. With pedestrian access at its base, the structure has a ladder ascending through the main former water tank section and up to the roof. The tank section extends to about 225 cubic metres, with an internal diameter of around 9.44m.</p>

      <p>Graeme Biffen, of Greenslade Taylor Hunt, said: “The sale of the now disused Broadclyst Water Tower affords an excellent and rare opportunity to acquire this striking and iconic structure.</p>
