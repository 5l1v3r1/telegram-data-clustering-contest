      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/porsha-williams">Porsha Williams</a> didn’t let foot surgery stop her from attending Bravo Con on Saturday. <i>The Real Housewives Of Atlanta</i> star looked as glamorous as ever in a belted cleavage-baring black mini dress as she was wheeled out onto the stage to huge cheers from the audience. Porsha rocked a curly half ponytail and paired her dress with one pointy-toed black stiletto heel and wore a surgical boot on the other foot.</p>
      <p>With a black fur chubby coat draped over her shoulders, Porsha smiled and waved from her wheelchair as she took her spot onstage for a panel discussion.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old mother-of-one shared the clip of her grand entrance on<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B48zFPZnzcf/"> Instagram</a> and it has received 160,000 likes and 175 comments so far.</p>
      <p>“Pushing thru boo #bravocon,” she wrote in the caption. “I love my supporters so much I would have never missed this! #RollOnEm.” Porsha then told fans that they could check out her stories to see the live recording of her panel at Brav Con with fellow cast members from <i>RHOA</i>.</p>
      <p>Porsha’s fans showered her with praise in the comments section of the post.</p>
      <p>One fan marveled at the fact that Porsha’s injured foot didn’t dull her star power.</p>
      <p>“Man how you look this good in a wheelchair⁉ #MelaninQueen” they wrote.</p>
      <p>“Injured and still came dressed to slay. Other franchises please take notes,” another added.</p>

      <p>Other admirers seemed particularly thrilled by the queenly way that she graced the stage</p>
      <p>“You better give us an old nasty roll-on Sis!!” another fan cheered.</p>
      <p>“You make EVERYTHING look fab,” a fourth Instagram user gushed.</p>

      <p>As the live recording in her Instagram stories reveals, the RHOA panel was called the Peach Tea Sip And Sea. Kenya Moore, Eva Marcille, and <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5741033/cynthia-bailey-sports-bra/">Cynthia Bailey</a> were on stage alongside Porsha.</p>
      <p>Porsha announced that she’d had surgery on her foot in an<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4odcS5nqvg/"> Instagram</a> post she created a week ago. In the caption, she explained that she is in the non-weightbearing stage of the recovery process and that it would last for a while.</p>

      <p>Porsha has made it look fun though. The announcement was paired with a video of her doing a dance in her wheelchair. She has also been pictured in a wheelchair with a fur accessory near the handles. In one of those photos, she’s tucked the surgical boot behind her and is showing off a knee-high snakeskin boot from her new Just Fab collection.
