      <p>Everton's latest strategy could be one of interest to a number of young players.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, it was revealed <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">the Blues</a> had used a major scouting connection to promote their youngsters to potential loan clubs from around the world.</p>
      <p>Gretar Steinsson attended the Wyscout Forum in Amsterdam to show off the club's talent not just to sides in England, but a number of teams overseas as well.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/football/competitions/premier-league/11861960/steinsson-everton-promoting-youngsters">Sky Sports</a>, Steinsson said: "For us it is very important for us to promote our younger players.  We have a very strong Academy with strong players coming through and we have a history of developing players and for a certain age group to reach the first-team is a big task.</p>
      <p>"And we are trying to breach that gap by bringing them out, bringing them out on loan and we need to promote them so we use this event to promote them, not just to clubs around the UK, but around the world.</p>
      <p>"We have players playing in Europe and doing really well, both Jonjoe Kenny and Fraser Hornby have really successful loans so far so we are trying to educate and promote young players who have a really bright future in the game."</p>
      <p>So, could an increased interest from overseas affect some of the club's current youngsters?</p>
      <p>We've taken a look at three players who could be attracting the eyes of foreign clubs following this latest strategy from Everton.</p>
      <h3>Antony Evans</h3>
      <p>Antony Evans has benefited from loan moves in the past, and there might have been a bit of surprise when he didn't secure another in the summer after a string of impressive performances for Blackpool.</p>
      <p>In fact, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-youngster-proves-hes-ready-16248906">David Unsworth told the ECHO</a> at the end of last term: "I hope he’s in somebody's first-team. Hopefully ours, if not someone else’s on loan.</p>
      <p>"He’s done his time now in the under-23s and he’s done me proud. I love him. He’s technically outstanding and I hope he has a really great career."</p>
      <p>Sides both in England and abroad have already been linked with a potential swoop for the promising forward and an increased focus on promoting players abroad could have increased his suitors.</p>
      <h3>Dennis Adeniran</h3>
      <p>The midfielder has proven himself to be one of Everton's most impressive midfielders so far this season, and is clearly benefiting from working with the first team on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>Dennis Adeniran was involved in Fulham's first team breifly before making the move to Goodison Park in 2017, but hasn't made the jump to the Blues senior side yet.</p>
      <p>However, he does seem ready for a step up if the club decide to make that decision - although his importance as a body in training might admittedly make that a bit tricky.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/david-unsworth-admits-everton-midfielder-17268665">Unsworth told the ECHO</a>: "I'm not too sure, he trains with the first-team every day which is great for him and he's getting his games with us.</p>
      <p>"That [a loan] might be a possibility but it wouldn't surprise me if he stayed until the end of the season with the first-team. Who knows!"</p>
      <h3>Beni Baningime</h3>
      <p>Another who might have expected to secure a loan during the summer, Beni Baningime has impressed hugely so far this term for the U23s.</p>
      <p>In fact, a few months ago, the midfielder was heavily tipped to potentially make a move abroad, with some claiming Brondy were interested in a potential swoop.</p>
      <p>No loan move materialised, but it wouldn't be beyond the realms of possibility to believe clubs would be coming back for the 21-year-old when the next transfer window comes around.</p>
      <p>Baningime is still an exciting and impressive talent, and could use the next window to potentially get a vital couple of months of first team football under his belt.</p>
