      <h1>Autism friendly places for all the family in Liverpool, Wirral, Sefton, St Helens and Cheshire</h1>
      <h2>Find things to do with the kids in an autism-friendly environment</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T05:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/gemma-jaleel/" target="_blank">Gemma Jaleel</a></address>
      <p>It can be a nightmare planning a <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-family">family</a> day out, making sure all the kids are dressed appropriately and have been to the toilet before getting everyone safely in the car.</p>
      <p>It can be even more difficult if your child has special needs, learning difficulties or autism - but this doesn't mean you should feel isolated or uncomfortable about venturing out.</p>
      <p>There are plenty of places all over <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool">Liverpool</a> and Merseyside which are autism-friendly and offer special stripped-back events and activities to help and support children with autism.</p>
      <p>Whether it’s adjusting lighting and volume, creating a more welcoming environment or opening the venue a little earlier for a more relaxing atmosphere, you'll be able to find somewhere to cater for you.</p>
      <p>Many venues have also signed up to an autism charter - an initiative run by the Wirral-based charity <a href="http://autismtogether.co.uk/">Autism Together</a> - which provides training for staff.</p>
      <p>These companies may also run autism-friendly sessions, activities or evenings. So with a little help, we've rounded up a list of places in Liverpool, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wirral">Wirral</a>, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/sefton">Sefton</a>, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/st-helens">St Helens</a> and <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/knowsley">Knowsley</a>.</p>
      <h3>National Museums Liverpool</h3>

      <p>National Museums Liverpool run a series of relaxed sessions, which are usually once a month, with family-friendly events, activities and workshops.</p>
      <p>Most of these are free and the kids can get involved in fun hands-on crafts in less crowded spaces.</p>
      <p>Quieter times for a visit include 2.30pm to 5pm on weekdays during school term times because the venues become quieter after school groups have left and 10am to 12pm on Sunday mornings.</p>
