      <p>CHICAGO — Losing Caris LeVert for five weeks has moved key backups such as Garrett Temple into the Nets’ starting lineup. But Kyrie Irving’s shoulder woes have them counting on heretofore forgotten men.</p>
      <p>Saturday, those forgotten men came through to help power the Nets to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/spencer-dinwiddie-leads-depleted-nets-to-crucial-win/">a 117-111 win over the Bulls</a>.</p>
      <p>“Huge. It was a must-win. We knew we had to come in and get a win and guys had to step up with Ky being out,” Theo Pinson said. “We know in this league you’ve got to win the ones you’re supposed to win and we think we’re supposed to win this.”</p>
      <p>Pinson had scored just four points in 10 minutes all season, but he finished with 10 against the Bulls in 17:47, essentially playing the backup point guard and handling the ball when Spencer Dinwiddie sat with foul trouble.</p>

      <p>“Do you play guys with four fouls, or do you trust your bench? I’ve got to keep reminding myself, let’s trust these guys, trust your development program, trust your young guys. I’m not sure I’ve done a great job of that so far,” coach Kenny Atkinson said. “I have to trust them because they’ve done the work, they know the program, they know what we’re doing. Trust them.”</p>
      <p>Temple started and had 12 points, while Dzanan Musa added five points, seven boards and five assists in a fourth straight solid game after logging just 39 minutes his entire rookie season.</p>
      <p>“That’s what we’re about,” Atkinson said. “We’ve got to trust these guys. They put in the work, they’ve been in our program a while so they understand what we’re doing. We can’t burn out our other guys, our top eight. We can’t play them 45 minutes. So, those guys’ contributions were huge.</p>
      <p>“Theo got in a rhythm in the second half and in that stretch in the first, he made some good shots. Nic Claxton was good. That was the ultimate team victory when your best player is out, let’s be honest, and everybody steps it up a level. It’s a real boost to our morale.”</p>
      <p>They’ll be needed with Atkinson acknowledging the Nets fully expect LeVert to miss five weeks. That’s the timeline an expert had given the Post on his thumb surgery.</p>
      <p>“[Dinwiddie] is one of our best players. We need him, especially with Caris out. And now, you’ve got Kyrie out,” Atkinson said. “Without Caris in general going forward these next five weeks, we really need him to step up.”</p>
      <p>Dinwiddie is averaging 22.8 points in his past five games.</p>
