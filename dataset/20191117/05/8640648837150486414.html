      <p><b>Donny and Marie Osmond’s</b> finale Saturday at the Flamingo closed an 11-year residency on the Strip. But there was a nod to the future as Marie’s co-hosts from the CBS show “The Talk” were in the theater for the send-off.</p>
      <p><b>Sheryl Underwood, Eve</b> and show moderator <b>Carrie Ann Inaba</b> attended the packed performance. Only <b>Sharon Osbourne</b> was absent. The room was at capacity, a little less than 800 in the house.</p>

      <p>“The Talk” production team was recording highlights of the final weekend for an appearance by D&amp;M on Monday’s episode. The footage included a trip to the Linq Promenade’s High Roller, which Marie teased to on her Facebook page. That led to about a hundred fans lining up to witness the uncommon event.</p>
      <p>Onetime teen idol <b>Debbie Gibson</b>, a Las Vegas resident and longtime friend of the duo, was among the preshow visitors. Gibson has known the duo since her teen years, as a supporter of the Children’s Miracle Network and a guest on the duo’s talk show in the 1990s.</p>
      <p>Raiders owner <b>Mark Davis</b> sent a dozen roses, handing the delivery assignment to <b>Robert Dolan</b> of Cashman Photo, who has worked more than 100 D&amp;M shows.</p>
      <p>Just before the finale’s opening curtain, the audience chanted, “We want the Osmonds! We want the Osmonds!” as if attending a music festival.</p>
      <p>The duo kicked off the show with “It Takes Two” to a roaring standing ovation. “Are you ready for the last show!?” Donny shouted, to more cheering.</p>

      <p>The night turned emotional, as expected, when Marie sat with the band for an acoustic run of “Baby, You’re Crazy.” A fan shouted, “We love you!” and Marie halted, her voice quivering.</p>
      <p>“I look at all of you and think, isn’t it glorious what has happened here in 11 years,” she said to the audience. Marie turned 60 this year.</p>
      <p>Offstage during a break in the show, as Donny sang from “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,” Marie said in a text message, “I’ve experienced some of my highest highs and some of my lowest lows while performing these 11 years at the Flamingo. I can honestly say I got through all of them because of the incredible community here in Vegas and because of all of our wonderful fans. I will miss you all tremendously! I’m a little bit country and a whole lot of Vegas.”</p>

      <p>Donny, 61, has been busy on his latest album, saying, “I’m not giving myself a deadline. When it’s ready, it’s ready.” Osmond plans to tour behind that new, yet-untitled release, in 2020. Expect him to make a stop in Las Vegas, his first solo headlining appearance in the city.</p>
      <p>Donny diverted from the script by bringing up his 5-year-old grandson, Benson, singing the “Happy Birthday” message he recorded for American Greetings.</p>

      <p>“Do you want to be a singer?” Donny asked. The little boy sang out, “Yes!”</p>
      <p>The original Osmonds are done performing concerts together, but there are more in line, for a long time.</p>
