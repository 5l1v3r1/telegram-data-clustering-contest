      <p><b>QUETTA: </b>The Balochistan Assembly has unanimously adopted a resolution calling for restoration of the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC).</p>
      <p>Tabling the resolution during the provincial assembly’s session on Friday, Balochistan National Party’s (BNP) Naseer Shahwani and Pashtoonkhwa Mili Awami Party’s (PkMAP) Nasrullah Khan Zeeray described the federal government’s Pakistan Medical Commission Ordinance 2019 as based on mala fide intentions.</p>
      <p>They said Balochistan has not got proper representation in the proposed commission.</p>
      <p>They said the commission does not protect interest of the people of Balochistan thus the house urges the provincial government to ask the central government for annulment of the ordinance.</p>
      <p>Sharing details of the resolution, Shahwani said the government has replaced the PMDC with a commission which does not give any representation to doctors.</p>
      <p>“The irony is that the government has sacked 50 staff members of the council. Therefore, the resolution seek immediate restoration of the PMDC,” Shahwani added.</p>
      <p>Supporting the resolution, provincial minister Sardar Abdul Rehman Kethran said all provinces had representation in the PMDC which ensured check and balance. “Balochistan chief minister has raised the issue at every forum and the government seeks to restore the PMDC in Balochistan,” he added.</p>
      <p>After a detailed debate on the resolution, the house unanimously adopted it.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Deputy Speaker Sardar Babar Musalkhail ruled to conclude the resolutions regarding resumption of Bostan-Zhob Railway Section, establishment of passport office in Washuk and gas supply from Ziarat to Qilla Saifullah.</p>
      <p>Taking with reference to recruitments in government departments, Finance Minister Zahoor Buledi vowed to ensure merit in hiring. He said the incumbent provincial government has pledged to fill 26,000 vacant posts in Balochistan,</p>
      <p>Buledi said the government has constituted committees headed by deputy commissioners in order to remove bottlenecks in government recruitments.</p>
      <p>“The opposition parties expressed reservations over recruitment in education department and the CM directed the Chief Minister Inspection Team (CMIT) to ensure merit in recruitment in secondary education departments. We will to take action against officials violating merit,” he said.</p>
      <p>Taking the floor, Balochistan Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee Chairman Akhtar Hussain Langau said the forest and wildlife department could not give proper replies to question regarding locations of the sites where five-year tree plantation campaign was run.</p>
      <p>The chair directed the provincial standing committee to probe into the matter immediately. Langau also urged the deputy speaker to take action against secretaries not showing seriousness toward public issues and not submitting answer in the PAC.</p>
