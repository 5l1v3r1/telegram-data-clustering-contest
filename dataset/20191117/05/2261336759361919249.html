        <i>Knight avoids a couple of winging punches and he counters with his own. Lobov switches stances and fires a straight left to the body. He lands a trio of punches on an advancing Knight. Knight slips a few punches again and scores against a off-balance Lobov. Lobov swinging big, but not connecting. Not a lot of volume from Knight in this round. A close one.</i>

          <b>Round 5: </b>
        </i>
        <i>They hug before the round starts. Knight coming out with fast hands, Lobov shelling up, both remain in the center of the ring. Knight lands a punch and Lobov drops to his knees, it looks like there’s something wrong with his eye. He can’t get up and the referee has to wave it off. That’s a TKO win for Knight.</i>
