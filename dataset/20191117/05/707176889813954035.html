      <h2>Hundreds of protesters holed up on campus as police block exits</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T05:33:13+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 05:33</time> by <a rel="author">Ravi Mattu, Sue-Lin Wong, Nicolle Liu</a></address>
      <p>Police fired tear gas and water cannon as they attempted to storm a university in the early hours of Monday morning after 24 hours of violence that saw a group of protesters barricade themselves on campus and authorities block roads and exits.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of demonstrators were holed up at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where fires raged inside and outside campus and barricades had been erected to stop the police advance.</p>
      <p>The university is just metres from a People's Liberation Army garrison, where soldiers with fixed bayonets watched the drama unfold.</p>
      <p>JG Tang, president of the university, said in a statement that he had negotiated a temporary ceasefire with the police to allow protesters to leave the campus if they refrained from using force.</p>
      <p>“In addition, we have received permission from the police for you to leave the campus peacefully and I will personally accompany you to the police station to ensure that your case will be fairly processed,” he added in a video posted on Facebook on Monday.</p>
      <p>However, when hundreds of students tried to flee the campus police fired tear gas at them.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong’s benchmark stock index was 1.1 per cent higher in late morning trading, despite the latest bout of political upheaval in the city. Brokers said the Hang Seng index was buoyed by hopes of progress in trade negotiations between the US and China.</p>
      <p>The stand-off followed a day of intense clashes that saw protesters hurl petrol bombs and bricks at police, who fired tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets. The demonstrators also set alight a police vehicle and a bridge linking the university to a nearby metro station.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, a police officer was hospitalised after being hit in the leg by an arrow. Police threatened to fire live ammunition if the “rioters” did not stop using lethal force.</p>
      <p>Several protesters were arrested on charges of rioting — which could carry a jail sentence of up to 10 years — as they left the campus on Sunday night. Police warned that they would use live ammunition against protesters who continued to attack them.</p>
      <p>“Everyone is exhausted and [when] someone wants to leave, they can’t. There are even kids that are 11, 12 years old,” said a social worker trapped in the campus late last night in a post on the Facebook page of Hong Kong Social Worker General Union. “We want to protect everyone that is still inside at the moment. We want to survive.”</p>
      <p>The latest confrontations came after one of the most violent weeks in the territory’s months-long political crisis, during which at least one person was shot by police, another was set on fire and a 70-year-old man died after he was hit in the head with a flying brick. Police warned the city was on <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f9dc4286-04f2-11ea-9afa-d9e2401fa7ca">“the brink of total collapse”</a>.</p>

      <p>Much of the conflict was focused on universities, which have typically been seen as sanctuaries in Hong Kong but turned into battlegrounds. The campus violence triggered an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c54b2c36-05aa-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd">exodus of mainland Chinese</a> students, and universities suspended classes for the rest of the semester.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators also closed several big roads across the territory and a metro rail line. The disruption forced authorities to close schools for several days last week. Schools will remain shut on Monday.</p>
      <p>The protests have battered Hong Kong’s economy, with government figures in recent months showing that retail sales and tourism arrivals have plunged. Local officials expect the city will fall into its first annual recession since 2009 with some analysts predicting that pressure on the economy will continue throughout 2020.</p>

      <p>The uptick in violence came a day after Chinese soldiers stationed in the city cleared bricks and debris from the streets, in what many saw as a highly symbolic and politically charged move. The PLA garrison uses the historic Gun Club Hill barracks, where the Gurkhas were stationed during British rule.</p>
      <p>The prospect that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/44e03c76-06b3-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd">Beijing would use PLA troops</a> to crush the protests has loomed over the demonstrations, culminating in August when Chinese state media shared images of a troop build-up in Shenzhen, the mainland Chinese city that borders Hong Kong. </p>
      <p>Videos of the street-cleaning effort were shared widely in Chinese state media and on Weibo, the Chinese social media platform.</p>

      <p>“We initiated this. Stopping violence and ending chaos is our responsibility,” a PLA soldier told reporters, using a phrase used by Chinese president Xi Jinping. A Hong Kong government spokesperson said the PLA’s clean-up efforts were “purely self-initiated voluntary community activity” and the government had not requested assistance.</p>
      <p>Chinese troops have been stationed in Hong Kong since the UK handed over the territory to China in 1997. Under Article 14 of Hong Kong’s mini constitution, known as the Basic Law, the PLA is not allowed to interfere in local affairs unless the Hong Kong government requests its help to provide disaster relief or maintain public order. The PLA helped with clean-up efforts in Hong Kong after Typhoon Mangkhut last year, the first time Chinese soldiers undertook such a role.</p>

      <p>A group of pro-democracy lawmakers condemned the PLA’s actions, saying they violated the Basic Law. “The government is attempting to make Hong Kong citizens increasingly used to and accepting of the PLA conducting public activities in Hong Kong, as if we were frogs in boiling water,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>One frontline police officer said some of his colleagues were “very happy” about the PLA’s assistance. The 30,000-strong force has become the focus of protester fury, with many criticising its handling of the conflict. More than 50 per cent of respondents to a survey by the Chinese University of Hong Kong in October said they had no trust in the police. </p>
      <p>Some people in Hong Kong took to social media to express their discontent at the presence of Chinese troops on the streets. “Today they voluntarily clean up. Next time they will voluntarily open fire,” read an anonymous post.</p>
