      <h1>Billie Eilisih’s New Song Everything I Wanted Is About Surrounding Yourself With Those You Trust And Who Trust You</h1>

      <p>Billie Eilish released her new song “everything i wanted” (the song is styled in lowercase letters) and fans are clamoring to discern the lyrics’ meanings. Some are worried that Billie is complaining about being famous but that isn’t exactly what she has stated the song’s intent is. The song speaks about a terrible dream that Billie had. In the dream, she jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge and committed suicide. After she had died, the people who had been surrounding her, such as fans, friends, and business associates, revealed that they never really liked her as much as they had let on. In the dream, and upon awakening, it was Billie’s brother Finneas who had come to her rescue.</p>
      <p>The dream seemed to be a warning to Billie that along with fame can come people who don’t have your best interest at heart and that it’s important to surround yourself with those who trust you and whom you trust.</p>
      <p>Many celebrities find that it is best to keep their friends who knew them before they were famous in their personal lives so that they always have a good friend they can count on. It appears that Billie’s brother Finneas is her greatest supporter and the person she trusts more than anyone else.</p>
      <p>The song’s chorus is as follows.</p>
      <blockquote>“I had a dream<br/>I got everything I wanted<br/>But when I wake up, I see<br/>You with me<br/>And you say, “As long as I’m here, no one can hurt you<br/>Don’t wanna lie here, but you can learn to<br/>If I could change the way that you see yourself<br/>You wouldn’t wonder why here, they don’t deserve you.”</blockquote>

      <p>What do you think about the lyrics in the song? Do you think it’s appropriate for Billie Eilish to sing about her personal struggles, even if they center around her being famous?</p>
