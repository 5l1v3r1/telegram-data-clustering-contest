      <h3>New horizons</h3>

      <h3>Clear waters</h3>
      <p>For a day trip with a difference, consider Cork Harbour.

Pure Cork offers a whole range of harbour exploration and discovery activities from visiting Spike Island, which was once the largest prison in the world, or whale watching in rebel waters. <b><a href="http://purecork.ie/">purecork.ie</a></b></p>
      <h3>London calling</h3>
      <p>The Lanesborough in London will transform its wine cellar into a luxurious festive Champagne Vault.
