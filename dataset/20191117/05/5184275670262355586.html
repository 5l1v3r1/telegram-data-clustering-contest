      <p>Anil Kapoor is amongst the evergreen stars of Bollywood, synonymous with the powerhouse energy. With his on-screen performances and charming persona, the actor has managed to bag a special place in the hearts of Indian audience. Apart from Bollywood, Anil also acted down South and here’s where he came across his first fan moment.</p>
      <p>In Bollywood, Anil Kapoor marked his journey with Hamare Tumhare in 1979 and also debuted in South during 1980, with a Telugu film Vamsa Vruksham. After completing these two films, Anil reveals of visiting Shirdi’s Sai Baba temple for seeking blessings for his career. He says, “I just prayed to him, asking him to bless me and shower more films onto me. I just wanted to work in films. I think this was 30 years ago.”</p>

      <p>He further adds about the incident, which made him realise that his work is reaching out to the people. He told The Asian Age, “As soon as I came out of the temple, a bus came near me where I was standing. This bus was jam-packed with people, who all ran to me for autographs when they saw me. I couldn’t help but wonder what I did for them to come to me, and they told me they are from Andhra Pradesh and they saw my Telegu film. It was my first fan moment, so I was very happy and excited. I was assured that Sai Baba had heard my prayers and he had sent all of them to me. Since then, there has been no looking back for me.”</p>
