      <p><b>Housefull 4 Box Office:</b><i> Housefull 4</i> did quite well in the third week as well despite <i>Bala</i> leading the show in a big way and accumulating huge moolah. Still, there was good audience for the Akshay Kumar led reincarnation comedy which hung on well out there right through the weekdays too.</p>
      <p>This was pretty much evidenced on Wednesday and Thursday as well when collections stayed over the <b>1 crore</b> mark.</p>

      <p>Later on the fourth Friday and Saturday there were some footfalls too, as a result of which the film currently stands at <b>206 crores*.</b> In fact, the Sajid Nadiadwala production will collect a bit more from here and should close in the vicinity of <b>210 crores.</b></p>
      <p>There are only a handful of comedies which have managed to make a mark as franchises and other than Housefull and Golmaal, the one which has gone big is <i>Dhamaal,</i> the third instalment of which crossed the <b>150 crores</b> mark earlier this year. The manner in which each of these three franchises has worked so far, there is going to be huge entertainment for the audiences in years to come.</p>
      <p>*Estimates. Final numbers awaited</p>
      <p>Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources</p>
