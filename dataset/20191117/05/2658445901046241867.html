      <h3>Olushola Victor</h3>
      <p>There is something to learn from Emeka Obasi, publisher of Business Hallmark and former Commissioner of Information in Imo State. He has refused to let ill-health get the better of him.</p>
      <p>In his book, ‘Saved for His Praise,’ unveiled last year, the media personality spoke about his battle with a debilitating medical infirmity that defied regular medical treatment.</p>
      <p>For divine healing, he had to visit men of God like Pastor Wole Oladiyun of the Christ Livingspring Apostolic Ministry (CLAM), Pastor Daniel Olukoya of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) and Pastor Enoch Adeboye of The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG). While his health has improved tremendously, he still uses a machine to support respiration.</p>
      <p>Last Sunday, he held a special award dinner, Business Hallmark People of the Year, at Civic Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. This has become a yearly ritual for the media company and Obasi has ensured that it didn’t die regardless of his personal battle.</p>
      <p>Although he wasn’t active at the event, his wife, Elizabeth, took charge of things. It was learnt that she has also been vital to the running of Business Hallmark.</p>
