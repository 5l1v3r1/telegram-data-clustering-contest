      <p>Isabella Hogan doesn't use Snapchat, Facebook or Twitter and has recently cut back on how much she uses Instagram, for safety reasons.</p>
      <p>"You can mistakenly post things on Instagram that you don't think are there, people you don't know could find out where you live, get your information, take your money," the year 8 student from Concord High School said.</p>

      <p>Isabella said she learned about the dangers of accidentally sharing personal data by becoming a "white hat hacker" as part of the Australian Computing Academy's school cyber security challenges.</p>
      <p>"In the program, you have to become a good hacker so you can learn how people can get your information," the 13-year-old said.</p>
      <p>"You have to look through fake social media accounts and look at the stuff that's been posted to see if you can find information about the person.</p>
      <p>"I was surprised about the sort of thing you can find from nothing."</p>
      <p>Isabella said one of the fake accounts had posted a photo with their desk in the background, where a Post-It note containing their password was visible.</p>
      <p>"Someone else posted a photo of their birthday party, which could tell you when their birthday is and lead you to their password," she said.</p>
      <p>"After doing the challenge I've changed a bunch of my passwords, which were really bad, and changed what I share.</p>
      <p>"I don't share things like my full name, the school I go to, or any information that could lead them to my password or where I am ... I wasn't aware of that danger before."</p>

      <p>The digital footprint project is one of four modules being rolled out to students online. The others are projects on data encryption, network security and web application security.</p>
      <p>Jeanine Kobylinski, the digital learning innovator at Abbotsleigh High School, said her school is also using the projects to show students what a career in cyber security can look like.</p>
      <p>"We could just code computer games in class but we're trying to look at career opportunities, we're looking at ethically hacking," Ms Kobylinski said.</p>
      <p>She said she is working with banks and other businesses to learn more about how they approach cyber security.</p>
      <p>"We're really trying to get girls interested in the broad term that is STEM and a lot are going into engineering, which is great, but cyber security is an avenue that also has so much money being invested into it," Ms Kobylinski said.</p>
      <p>The challenge is also helping students better navigate their own online presence, she said.</p>
      <p>"We use that term of young adults being digital natives but they often aren't entirely sure how their data and online profile is saved and what they should share," Ms Kobylinski said.</p>
      <p>"They're very interested, it's teaching them to think about, 'I shouldn't have put that photo up or I should change my privacy settings'. The module lets you look at what someone else has posted so you can think about whether you are doing similar things."</p>
