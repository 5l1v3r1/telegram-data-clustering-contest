      <h1>Andy Cohen Teases That RHOBH Will Be ‘Very Dramatic’ Following Lisa Vanderpump’s Exit – ‘Alliances Have Shifted!’</h1>

      <p>It sounds like the fans of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills can look forward to a season unlike any other! According to Bravo’s boss, Andy Cohen, season 10 is bound to be ‘very dramatic!’ It comes after Lisa Vanderpump’s exit from the reality TV show so it’ll be interesting to see how her departure will be affecting the storyline!</p>
      <p>Fans have definitely been unsure as to what to think ever since her departure but it sounds like they can rest assured – the season will be very entertaining even without the OG.</p>
      <p>While at the very first edition of BravoCon, Andy gave an interview to HollywoodLife, telling the news outlet that: ‘We’re in the middle of shooting and it’s very dramatic and it’s unusual that we got the women together while they’re shooting. Certain alliances have shifted. There’s been a lot of new friendships and friendships that have dissolved, and I think people are going to be really surprised to see where it’s gone.’</p>
      <p>Before her decision to leave RHOBH, Lisa went through a lot!</p>
      <p>Not only did she lose her mother and brother in the span of a year or so but she also had a lot of drama with pretty much all of her co-stars over the whole Puppy Gate scandal.</p>
      <p>Everyone was against her as she was dealing with the devastating losses so Lisa decided it was time to get away from that negative space and left the show!</p>
      <p>Andy assured the site that he has no hard feelings when it comes to Lisa’s exit from Real Housewives.</p>
      <p>‘Listen, it’s a voluntary process. If you don’t want to be on, you don’t have to be on. We’re good. I saw her last week. She’s still very much a part of Bravo with Vanderpump Rules and the door’s always open for when she wants to come back.’</p>
