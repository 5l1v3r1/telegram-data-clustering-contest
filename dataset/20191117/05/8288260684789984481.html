      <p>‘Health issues’ at a Sutton Coldfield secondary school have prompted an application for a new classroom block extension.</p>
      <p>Bishop Walsh Catholic School has submitted plans for an extension to the existing school to create a new two-storey building with five classrooms and two additional flexible study rooms after concerns for both students and teachers in ‘deteriorating’ temporary classrooms.</p>
      <p>A statement accompanying a planning application submitted to Birmingham City Council said: “The existing mobile units have been deteriorating over time due to their age and construction and are causing health issues for the staff and pupils as well as not providing a pleasant teaching environment.</p>

      <p>“So a permanent replacement to accommodate the teaching spaces is required.”</p>
      <p>The school said it noticed a dip in attendance in the 2018/19 academic year from 96.3 per cent to 95.8 per cent – and explained that a drop of just 0.5 per cent amounted to a ‘significant amount of lessons missed’.</p>
      <p>The school attributed the drop to the conditions at the Cardinal Newman Centre at the school – which routinely had to be cleared of mould on the outside of the building</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The ‘temporary’ block was installed in 2008 but more than 10 years on had not been replaced.</p>
      <p>Former Bishop Walsh headteacher who now heads the St John Paul II Multi Academy Trust as the senior executive leader, which the school is a part of, John Farrell, said: “We had never been able to secure enough funding to replace the block.</p>
      <p>“We did an analysis of the attendance figures and lots of reasons were low level – colds and coughs.</p>
      <p>“We speculated the reason for the attendance drop was people working in the ‘temporary’ Cardinal Newman Centre. It has been temporary since 2008!</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“It’s fit for purpose. My office is in it - but we want to build a new block as a sixth form building.”</p>
      <p>The plan is to replace two prefabricated mobile classrooms to the north of the school site which are now in ‘very poor condition due to being well past their expected lifespan.” The new block will be an extension to the school.</p>
      <p>The new block will also improve the school’s carbon footprint replacing poorly insulated prefab classrooms with ‘well-insulated permanent building constructed in modern building techniques’.</p>
      <p>Classrooms will be separated by a corridor on the ground floor and the first floor block will cantilever over the entrance to create a ‘visually appealing canopy’. The block will also include an office and toilets.</p>
      <p>Teresa Cotter, executive principal at Bishop Walsh Catholic School said: “In 2008, we purchased some mobile classrooms to accommodate the expansion of our popular and successful school. Over time, their condition has worsened so we have applied for funding for a new block.</p>
      <p>“Although there are no specific issues at present and the buildings are safe to use, they are far from ideal. The worst affected areas have been taken out of use and we have installed temporary heating throughout all areas.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“There is a constant programme of repair and maintenance to address the defects in the buildings. The proposed new block, if the planning and funding application are successful, would completely replace the existing mobile classrooms and so we hope for approval to give us the best possible learning environment for our students and staff.”</p>
      <p>Anyone wanting to comment on the application should visit Birmingham City Council’s online planning portal and search for planning application number: 2019/08455/PA. The public consultation period ends on November 25.</p>
