      <p>NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices consolidated in a narrow range past week amid lack of directional cues. While the US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Power painted a rosy view of the US economy in a speech, President <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Donald-Trump">Donald Trump</a> refused to offer fresh details on the on-going trade negotiations with China in an otherwise much awaited speech, thus disappointing investors globally.</p>
      <p>At home, three big telecom operators together reported losses in excess of Rs 1,00,000 crore for the September quarter. <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/bharti-airtel-ltd/stocks/companyid-2718.cms">Bharti Airtel</a>, only Nifty/Sensex component, gained 5 per cent for the week, as mammoth losses failed to hurt sentiment much.</p>
      <p>Overall, for the week, Sensex gained 33.08 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 40,356.69. Nifty ended the truncated week at 11895.45, down 12.7 points or 0.11 per cent.</p>
