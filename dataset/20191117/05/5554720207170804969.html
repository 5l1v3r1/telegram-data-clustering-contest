      <p>Student Mohd Faiz Uddin had approached Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi for immediate help since his application for an education loan was pending for more than six months. The delay, according to the student, had posed questions on his future since his admission in Delhi’s Jamia Hamdard was likely to be cancelled if he did not clear his fees by 13 November.</p>
