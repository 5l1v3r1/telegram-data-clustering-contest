      <h1>The parts of Birmingham seeing a boom in house building</h1>
      <h2>New government figures have revealed that Birmingham gained an extra 4,187 residential properties over the course of 2018/19</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T05:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, Annie Gouk, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>Birmingham is seeing a boom in house building, with more new homes cropping up in the city in the last year than ever before.</p>
      <p>New government figures have revealed that Birmingham gained an extra 4,187 residential properties over the course of 2018/19.</p>
      <p>It brings the total number of houses and flats in the city to more than 441,500.</p>
      <p>As well as new builds, the new homes include other properties that have been converted into dwellings during the year, such as offices or retail spaces.</p>
      <p>The number of additional houses and flats is up by 33% from the year before, when there were 3,160 new homes created in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>It’s also the biggest number of new homes brought to the city in a single year since the figures first began in 2001/02.</p>

      <p>It means that home creation in Birmingham is keeping apace with the burgeoning population - something that will need to continue if the city is to stave off a housing crisis.</p>
      <p>There are currently estimated to be around 427,000 families living in Birmingham - a figure that is predicted to rise to 472,000 families by 2041.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>This increase will be driven both by “natural” factors - more births than deaths - and immigration from other parts of the UK and abroad.</p>
      <p>If the number of new homes being created in the city continues at the rate it has in the last year, there will be more than 533,600 houses and flats on offer - far more than the number needed.</p>

      <p>However, building new homes is not enough to prevent homelessness - the real issue is housing affordability.</p>
      <p>Growing house prices mean that fewer people are able to buy their own home, and many families find themselves stuck in the private rented sector.</p>
      <p>The rise in the number of people renting also increases the cost, meaning low-income families can run out of options when it comes to finding a safe, secure and affordable home.</p>
      <p>These particular figures don’t give details on whether the new homes will be sold, rented, or how affordable they are likely to be.</p>
      <p>However, in general house prices in Birmingham have been increasing.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The average home in Birmingham sold for £190,208 in September this year - up from £186,862 in the same month of 2018, and more than three times as much as the average price of £56,753 seen in 1999.</p>
      <p>If that long term trend continues, the city could see average house prices reach £447,281 in 20 years time.</p>
