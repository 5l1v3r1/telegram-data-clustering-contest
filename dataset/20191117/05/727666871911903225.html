      <h1>Is Jay-Z Mad At Colin Kaepernick Over NFL Try-Out?</h1>

      <p>Jay-Z may have helped Kap out and...well, Kap was running a different play.</p>
      <p>
        <b>(AllHipHop Rumors) </b>
        <i>"Now the team got beef between the Post and the Point This puts the ring in jeopardy – indefinitely" - Jay-Z</i>
      </p>
      <p>Now there were rumors that Jay-Z helped get Colin Kaepernick a tryout look with the NFL. Some believed it and others thought it was just some PR stunt by the league. Either way, I thought it was a good step towards some resolution. All of the teams in the league were to be represented on Saturday, November 16, 2019 - in the year of our Lord. Suddenly, without warning, at the last minute...Kap called an audible. He changed the location of the workout about an hour before it all went down. Not only did he change the location, but it was also moved about 60 miles away. The Kaepernick team also pushed back the time for an hour to give the NFL scouts time to get out to the new location. </p>
      <p>About 6-7 teams ended up making it to the new workout, which lasted for about 40 minutes. Initially, there were 25 squads confirmed for the original location. I have to say....this was bizarre. I will say no more about it personally. Kap told reporters, "I've been ready for three years. I've been denied for three years. We are waiting for the 32 owners, 32 teams and Roger Goodell [the NFL Commissioner] to stop running. Stop running from the truth, stop running from the people."I will stick to the rumors.</p>
      <p>The rumor is that Jay-Z is upset about the way things turned out. I could be some sort of new nut, but the only way I can see this emotion coming over Jigga is if he actually did "stick his neck out" for Kappy. If he did and then Kap...made it hard for the NFL reps to get there, well then...that was not in the plan. Right now, Jay and his crew are all in Florida somewhere having a great time in the name of giving back for The Shawn Carter Foundation Gala at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. He may or may not care about Kap at the moment, but I am thinking this matters. </p>
      <p>Stephen A. Smith offered his couple of cents and he really...lets loose.</p>
      <p> Kap and the League had a disagreement over some of the particulars about the workout. Seems like Kap wanted it open for all to see and the league wanted some restrictions. Below is some of what transpired over social media.</p>
      <p>The League really puts the blame squarely on Kap. There is more below.</p>
      <p>Here are Kaepernick's exact words. through his reps: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>"From the outset, Mr. Kaepernick requested a legitimate process and from the outset the NFL league office has not provided one. Most recently, the NFL has demanded that as a precondition to the workout, Mr. Kaepernick sign an unusual liability waiver that addresses employment-related issues and rejected the standard liability waiver from physical injury proposed by Mr. Kaepernick's representatives.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <i>"Additionally, Mr. Kaepernick requested all media be allowed into the workout to observe and film it and for an independent film crew to be there to ensure transparency. The NFL denied this request. Based on the prior conduct by the league office, Mr. Kaepernick simply asks for a transparent and open process which is why a new location has been selected for today. Mr. Kaepernick looks forward to seeing the representatives from the clubs today."</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The only silver lining is technology. I believe all of the teams will be sent copies of the workout. I don't see this working out...ever. </p>
