      <h1>Arsenal 'considering £43m Pau Torres transfer' in bid to sort defensive issues</h1>
      <h2>The centre-back has impressed for Villarreal this season and scored on his international debut for Spain on Friday</h2>

      <p>Arsenal are interested in signing Spanish defender Pau Torres in a bid to fix the club's defensive issues, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are on the lookout for defensive reinforcements in January after already conceding 17 goals in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>And according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10360897/arsenal-january-transfer-pau-torres/">The Sun</a> , Unai Emery is considering a move for Villarreal centre-back Torres after an impressive start to the season.</p>
      <p>Acquiring the highly-rated defender will be no easy task after he signed a new contract with the club last month which reportedly contains a £43million release clause.</p>
      <p>However, the publication claims that the North London club are currently looking at a deal based on staggered payments - similar to the one which brought Nicolas Pepe to the Emirates Stadium for £72m during the summer.</p>

      <p>After impressing on loan at second-tier side Malaga last season, the 22-year-old has become a regular for Villarreal this season and has played every minute of their current La Liga campaign.</p>
      <p>His recent performances also earned him a place in current Spain squad and he made his international debut against Malta on Friday.</p>
      <p>Torres, who is also believed to be attracting interest from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , replaced Sergio Ramos during the second half and marked his first cap with a goal during the 7-0 win.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> manager Emery is under growing pressure after a disappointing string of results and will be looking to turn things around when his side hosts <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> next weekend.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are sixth in the Premier League but have experienced the same problems in the back-line that saw the club concede 51 goals last season.</p>
      <p>Despite the summer additions of David Luiz and Kieran Tierney, Unai Emery's side currently have a goal-difference of -1 and have failed to keep clean sheets in each of their last seven matches in all competitions.</p>
