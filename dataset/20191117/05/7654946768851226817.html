      <h1>Top NSC official testified Trump and Sondland spoke some 5 times about Ukraine</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T05:51:07+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 05:51</time> by <a rel="author">Laura Italiano</a></address>
      <p>Transcripts released Saturday from closed-door testimony in the House impeachment inquiry tie President Trump more closely to the central charge from Democrats: that he held up military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigations he hoped would discredit <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/24/watch-live-robert-mueller-testifies-before-congress/">the Mueller investigation</a> and Vice President Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>The revelations come from hundreds of pages of deposition transcripts from Tim Morrison, a former top official at the National Security Council and a longtime Republican defense hawk.</p>
      <p>Morrison testified that Gordon Sondland, US ambassador to the European Union, and Trump had <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/white-house-releases-transcript-of-trumps-first-call-with-ukraines-volodymyr-zelensky/">spoken some five times</a> between July 15 and Sept. 11, the weeks that $391 million in US assistance was withheld from Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Sondland “related to me . . . he was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/gordon-sondland-told-trump-ukrainian-president-loves-your-ass/">discussing these matters</a> with the president,” Morrison said.</p>
