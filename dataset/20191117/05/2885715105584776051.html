      <p>The United States and South Korea on Sunday said they were postponing a joint military air exercise that North Korea has criticised as provocative.</p>
      <p>US Defense Secretary Mark Esper and his South Korean counterpart made the announcement in Bangkok, where they were attending an Asia defence ministers conference.</p>
      <p>As recently as Friday, when Esper was in Seoul to consult with South Korean officials, there was no word on postponing the military air exercise, which had been called Vigilant Ace.</p>
      <p>Seoul and Washington had scaled back the exercise recently and changed the name, but North Korea strongly objected, calling it evidence of a lack of interest in improving relations.</p>
      <p>The North has demanded accommodations before it will agree to resume nuclear negotiations.</p>
      <p>South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo said the exercise had been put off pending further consultations between Seoul and Washington. No new date has been set.</p>
      <p>Esper told reporters he did not consider the postponement a concession to North Korea.</p>
      <p>“I see this as a good-faith effort by the United States and the Republic of Korea to enable peace … to facilitate a political agreement, a deal if you will, that leads to the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula,” Esper said.</p>
