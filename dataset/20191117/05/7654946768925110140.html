      <p>MONTREAL — Kyle Palmieri scored a power-play goal 1:30 into overtime to complete the Devils’ comeback from two goals down in a 4-3 win over the Canadiens on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Nikita Gusev, Nico Hischier and Wayne Simmonds also scored for the Devils, who trailed 3-1 late in the second. Mackenzie Blackwood, playing his second game in two nights, stopped 31 shots.</p>
      <p>Palmeiri got the winner on a one-timer from Taylor Hall with Montreal’s Phillip Danault in the penalty box for hooking Hall, giving the Devils their sixth straight win against the Canadiens.<br/>Brendan Gallagher, Cale Fleury and Nick Suzuki scored for the Canadiens, who ended a three-game win streak. Keith Kinkaid made 39 saves against his former team.</p>
      <p>Both teams were playing the second of back-to-back games. New Jersey beat Pittsburgh 2-1 on Friday while Montreal won 5-2 at Washington.</p>
      <p>The Devils started their comeback when Hischier beat Kinkaid short-handed on a 2-on-1 rush with 2 seconds left in the second period. Kinkaid stopped Hischier on a breakaway less than 30 seconds earlier.</p>
      <p>The Canadiens took five penalties in the third period and the lack of discipline finally cost them when Simmonds tied it at 3-3 with 4:48 left. Max Domi was in the box for interference and unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>
      <p>Danault appeared to give Montreal a 4-3 lead with 47 seconds left but it was waved off when the referees deemed the forward kicked the puck into the net.</p>
      <p>Gallagher got the Canadiens on the scoreboard first as he found space in the slot and got his stick on Jeff Petry’s shot for his ninth of with 1:19 left in the first.</p>
      <p>Late-period goals have plagued Montreal all season and Saturday was no exception.</p>
      <p>Kinkaid made 19 straight stops to start the game but the 20th shot went in. Gusev was left alone in the crease and scored with 19 seconds on the clock to tie it 1-1.</p>
      <p>Montreal took a 2-1 lead when Fleury scored his first NHL goal at 7:43 of the second. The rookie defenseman skated in from the blue line, avoided Pavel Zacha’s slide and beat Blackwood on the backhand.</p>
      <p>Suzuki put the Canadiens up 3-1 with a 5-on-3 power-play goal, a tap-in from the side of the net with 1:18 remaining in the second on Domi’s rebound. New Jersey has the league’s worst penalty kill on the road this season.</p>
