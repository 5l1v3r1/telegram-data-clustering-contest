        <b>Aries</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>March 21- April 19</i>
      </p>
      <p>There’s a lot going on in your sector of intimacy and joint resources prompting even the most commitment-phobic Ram to settle down with your special someone or in some way cement your status. This is also an ideal time to get your finances in good working order by facing the reality of your circumstances.</p>

        <b>Taurus</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>April 20-May 20</i>
      </p>
      <p>Strength and unity build a firm foundation for making joint decisions and paving a bright future. Singles may find yourselves attracted to someone dynamic and highly intelligent, perhaps a great conversationalist that draws you out of yourself. Librans and Scorpios are contenders. In terms of getting along with others you’ll be more eloquent and well-received.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gemini</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>May 21-June 21</i>
      </p>
      <p>You love doing many things at once and although you may complain when rushed off your feet you wouldn’t have it any other way. However, today calls for a change of tack. Start the week by slowing down and taking stock of your life, particularly your daily routine. Reassess and formulate a realistic regime that works for you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cancer</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>June 22-July 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>Something or, more importantly, someone that you were red-hot about may turn tepid. The Sun’s presence may boost your likes and dislikes, but retrograde Mercury is making you rethink your desires. Armed with this knowledge don’t declare your undying love, buy something costly or make an investment because the chances are you’ll change your mind.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Leo</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>July 23-August 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>Transformation and reclaiming your power is in store as the stars encourage you to dig beneath the surface and confront inconvenient truths. This will initially be uncomfortable but once you face the music freedom and personal growth will follow. If there are any negative habits or influences you need to sever, now is the time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Virgo</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>August 23-September 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>If there’s one thing you excel at, it’s taking care of the finer details. You’ll enjoy organising, analysing and regrouping in order to make your everyday life operate at an optimal level. With your wit and self-expression also at its peak this is a good time to clear the air with someone or reach a new audience.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Libra</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>September 23-October 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>Ruled by luxury-loving Venus you can’t help but have fine taste. However, a rude shock will force you to stop living the sort of a champagne lifestyle you’re used to, especially if you can’t afford it. Develop a plan to clear any existing debt and consolidate your assets. Professional advice will further motivate and educate you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Scorpio</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>October 23 – November 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>Capture the cosmos’ cleansing energy by rebooting your mindset. Take a dip in the ocean or Epsom salt bath while focusing on positive affirmations and goals - you’ll emerge like a butterfly from its chrysalis! Although you’ll feel shiny and new this period is also good for reinventing something old that still works instead of jettisoning it altogether.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sagittarius</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>November 23-December 20</i>
      </p>
      <p>You’re usually an open book and candid as the day is long. However now you’ll be a lot more secretive than usual. Experience, superstition or something else altogether will prompt you to keep projects under wraps and your cards very close to your chest. Not even those closest to you will be able to pry information.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Capricorn</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>December 21-January 19</i>
      </p>
      <p>The stars illuminate your sector of group efforts making you cheerful, yet assertive, communicative but also a better listener. You’re also sure to come up with some brilliant ideas that will be embraced by all and sundry. If you’re not used to assuming a leadership role step out of your comfort zone and take the helm.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aquarius</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>January 20-February 18</i>
      </p>
      <p>Your reputation is at stake. Rebellious Aquarians don’t much care for toeing the company line however as the stars highlight your sector of status this could be a life changing period for you. I’m not suggesting you put on a clown suit and jump through hoops but playing the game can and will work to your advantage.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pisces</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>February 19-March 20</i>
      </p>
      <p>Something you thought to be gospel may be on shaky ground as you’re compelled to rethink your beliefs. New information about a person or situation may surface giving you reason to question what you have long held to be true. Thankfully, your greatest qualities are flexibility and open-mindedness so adjusting to new convictions won’t be a struggle.</p>
