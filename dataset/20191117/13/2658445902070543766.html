      <h4>Our Reporter</h4>
      <p>Scotland beat Cyprus 2-1 to go third in Euro 2020 qualifying Group I. Ryan Christie opened the scoring for Scotland in the first half with a strike into the top corner. Georgios Efrem then equalised for Cyprus with a stunning volley only a minute into the second period.</p>
      <p>The home side were level for just six minutes though as John McGinn flicked Scotland in front for the second time in the match. Cyprus couldn’t find a second equaliser and the match finished 2-1.</p>
      <p>Scotland came into their penultimate Group I game knowing they could no longer qualify for Euro 2020 through their group, but would have been looking to claim third spot nonetheless.</p>

      <p>But it was Cyprus who had the first real chance of the game with just five minutes on the clock.</p>
      <p>Some neat exchanges on the edge of the Cyprus led to Georgios Efrem striking the crossbar with a right-footed effort. The ball appeared the cross the line but the referee failed to signal for a goal.</p>
      <p>Replays showed the entire ball was clearly over all of the line and had goal-line technology been in place for the game, Cyprus would have been 1-0 up.</p>
      <p>Just six minutes later and the away side were ahead. Christie found the top corner with a stunning, curling effort that gave Cyprus goalkeeper Urko Pardo with no chance.</p>
      <p>The game was by no means over. Pieros Sotiriou looked dangerous in attack and his low effort had to be beaten away by Scotland goalkeeper David Marshall.</p>
