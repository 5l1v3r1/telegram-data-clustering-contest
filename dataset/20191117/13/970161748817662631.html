      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/real-madrid/">Real Madrid</a> star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/eden-hazard/">Eden Hazard</a> has praised <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/frank-lampard/">Frank Lampard</a>’s start in charge of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> and believes his old teammate can become one of the best managers in the world.</p>
      <p>The Belgian winger moved from Stamford Bridge to the Bernabeu a month before Lampard took over at the west London club, with the side thriving under his leadership.</p>
      <p>Lampard has promoted a host of Chelsea’s youngsters – notably Fikayo Tomori, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham – and the side currently sit in third place in the Premier League table.</p>

      <p>Despite his move to Spain, Hazard says he has kept a close eye on his old club and was in no doubt about Lampard’s managerial credentials.</p>
      <p>Asked if he was surprised by Lampard’s impact, Hazard told reports while on international duty with Belgium: ‘No, not at all.</p>

      <p>‘I know Frank as a player, not as a manger, but he’s a great guy. He’s showed already after four months that he can be one of the best managers in the world.</p>
      <p>‘The good thing is that they are playing with young players, young English players. For England it’s good, for Chelsea’s it’s good. They are lucky to have young players with quality.’</p>
      <p>Chelsea’s transfer ban has been credited with giving Lampard license to integrate young players, though Hazard believes they could be doing even better if they had been able to bring in a few new recruits.</p>

      <p>Asked if the ban was a blessing in disguise, Hazard continued: ‘I don’t know. Maybe with two or three more players they would first!</p>
      <p>‘When I saw them play it’s nice, they all play together. I still have good friends there. I follow them all the time. They are winning at the moment so I’m just happy for them.’</p>
