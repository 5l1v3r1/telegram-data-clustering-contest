      <p>Mokotjo became a regular for Bafana Bafana under Stuart Baxter during the Englishman’s time with the South African national team and that had looked to continue under Ntseki after he started in the Nelson Mandela Challenge win over Mali.<br/><br/>However the Brentford star wasn’t even in the matchday squad for the African Cup of Nations qualifier against the Black Stars – that Bafana lost 2-0 – and it has now been revealed that Ntseki was instructed by his medical team not to use him in Cape Coast.<br/><br/>Team doctor, Thulani Ngwenya, told the media today that Mokotjo’s heavy game schedule and arrival time in Ghana led to their decision to recommend that he be left out, although he is expected to be in contention to face Sudan this afternoon at Orlando Stadium./<br/><br/>Ngwenya explained, “After an assessment that we did, our medical team along with our physical trainer, we realised that Kamo has played six matches in three weeks, and he has played 90 minutes in all of those matches.<br/><br/>“He travelled and arrived in camp the day before the actual match. When we assessed him and his actual condition, he was really fatigued. He couldn’t really give us 90 minutes, so we took the medical team took the decision to rest him for the game against Ghana so that he’s fresher for the game against Sudan. It was purely a medical decision.”<br/><br/>Bafana face Sudan at 15h00 today, with Ntseki expected to make some changes to the XI that was beaten in their first game earlier in the week.</p>
