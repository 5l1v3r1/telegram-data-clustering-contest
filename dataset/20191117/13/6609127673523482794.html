      <p>But the inspirational ex-<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> defender has now left the squad which will face the Estonian's in their final qualifying match on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>No further details have been released by the Dutch FA except to say he is unavailable for the game in Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk is expected to report back for Liverpool once the international break is over ahead of their clash with Crystal Palace next weekend.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old is the latest player to be sent back to Anfield from national team duty .</p>
      <p>Captain Jordan Henderson missed England's win over Montenegro through suspension and a minor illness has seen him forced out of today's clash with Kosovo.</p>
      <p>He was joined on the way back from the Three Lions camp by team-mate Joe Gomez, who suffered an injury at St George's Park, although it is not thought to be serious.</p>
      <p>And last week full-back Andy Robertson pulled out of the Scotland squad ahead of yesterday's 2-1 win over Cyprus.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk has been an ever-present for Liverpool this season as he continues to become a greater influence on the side.</p>
      <p>His performances over the past two years have seen him to develop into a player who is widely regarded as the best defender in the world.</p>
      <p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp will be anxious to get as many players back without issue as possible from the international break ahead of a period of heavy congestion in the fixture list.</p>
