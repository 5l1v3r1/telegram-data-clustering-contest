      <p>From the moment of conception through to birth, pregnancy can be wonderful and terrifying at the same time.</p>
      <p>For the partner who watches their loved one’s body <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/parents/pregnancy-body/">grow and change</a> while trying to do and say all the right things, it can be a hard balance to strike.</p>
      <p><i>Mamamia</i> talks to four partners about how they handled pregnancy and birth from their important support-act perspective.</p>
      <h3>David, father to Charlie (6) and Emika (2).</h3>
      <p>David had just graduated from university when wife Jess surprised him with the ‘gift’ of a positive pregnancy stick.</p>
      <p>“I was ecstatic! We had been trying to conceive so we were thrilled to discover we were going to be parents for the first time.</p>
      <p>“I watched in awe as Jess’ body changed and I loved feeling the baby moving around in her tummy. I felt envious that she got to have that experience.”</p>
      <p>The pregnancy was not the easiest for Jess who suffered from morning sickness and towards the end, the pregnancy rash PUPPPs (Pruritic Urticarial Papules and Plaques of Pregnancy).</p>
      <p>“By that stage, I felt quite anxious and as it was our first time, I wasn’t sure what to expect with the birth.”</p>
      <p>Charlie was born in 2012 and David’s feelings for his son were never in doubt.</p>
      <p>“As soon as I saw him I fell in love! I have never loved a bloke more and thinking about it now still makes me very emotional.”</p>
      <p>His reaction at the gender reveal party for their second pregnancy took him by surprise.</p>
      <p>“When we cut the cake to reveal pink for a girl, I was absolutely stoked. I had this sense of completeness for our family.”</p>
      <p>After going through the private hospital system with Charlie, Jess and David decided on a home birth for baby Emika.</p>
      <p>“Jess was a warrior and while my anxiety levels were higher with her giving birth at home in a pool, it was a really beautiful and positive experience.”</p>

      <h3>Ben, father to (as yet unnamed) newborn girl.</h3>
      <p>When Ben first found out wife Helen was pregnant, he was terrified.</p>
      <p>“I had almost given up on the thought of having kids as I am over 40. I worried whether I would be a good father and felt generally scared about all the change that I knew was coming!”</p>
      <p>Helen’s pregnancy was tough and it often left Ben feeling helpless.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/what-is-hyperemesis-gravidarum/">She would vomit</a> most days and her appetite disappeared so we were under a lot of stress.</p>
      <p>“I also just felt really guilty and if I could have taken some of those symptoms away, I would have. I tried to help out practically and be supportive – cleaning up when she was sick.”</p>
      <p>The couple attended a child birthing course over a weekend and while Helen did a breastfeeding class, Ben took a short course on fatherhood.</p>
      <p>“It was mostly common-sense stuff, but it was good to be reminded how to be there for the new baby, while maintaining an honest and supportive relationship with your wife.”</p>
      <p>The birth was lengthy and ended with an assisted delivery.</p>
      <p>“I hated seeing Helen in pain, knowing there was nothing I could medically do to help.</p>
      <p>“After hours of labour, Helen was exhausted and while the doctors and nurses kept reassuring me that baby was okay, I kept thinking, ‘that’s great, but what about Helen?’”</p>
      <p>“As soon as I saw my baby girl though, my eyes welled up. She is beautiful and I am so excited for our future as a family.”</p>

      <h3>Miriam, mother to Oliver (2).</h3>
      <p>Miriam experienced every emotion possible when she discovered her partner Kristy was pregnant in 2016.</p>
      <p>“I was happy and excited about the future but also terrified as reality set in that we would have a real-life baby to be responsible for!”</p>
      <p>During the pregnancy, Miriam felt plenty of anxiety but also a little strange as the non-pregnant partner in a same-sex relationship.</p>
      <p>“It was weird at times not having the role that a woman typically would, so I busied myself reading and making heaps of notes about birthing and breastfeeding to help Kristy when the time came. I really didn’t want to let her down, but I think I actually drove her a little crazy!”</p>
      <p>“I was obsessed with making the nursery look good as I knew we would have no time after he was born.</p>
      <p>“We also attended a very helpful ‘Calm Birth’ course. It was practical and science-based and it taught me a lot about what to expect. I felt much more capable.”</p>
      <p>As the labour got underway, Miriam was in her element.</p>
      <p>“I was calm and it felt good to be able to help Kristy with breathing and staying comfortable.</p>
      <p>“When Oliver eventually arrived I just froze in shock! I enjoyed cutting the umbilical cord, it made me feel part of it all.</p>
      <p>“One thing I didn’t expect was how it made me question whether or not I would ever want to be in Kristy’s position and give birth!”</p>

      <h3>Paul, father to Oli (2).</h3>
      <p>After wife Melinda became pregnant a lot faster than expected, Paul’s first emotion was one of shock.</p>
      <p>“I had always wanted a family but assumed it would take a while, so we were surprised when Mel quickly fell pregnant.</p>
      <p>“I was really happy and relaxed along the way; her pregnancy was uneventful.</p>
      <p>“We both went along to a midwife-led birthing and parenting course, which was useful and I really loved that whole period.</p>
      <p>“I remember Mel saying she just felt ‘really loved’ while she was pregnant, because she did!"</p>
      <p>By the time the birth began, Paul’s relaxed demeanour was put the test.</p>
      <p>“I work as a nurse on a surgical ward so I'm not afraid of the sight of blood, but I could see Mel’s discomfort and it made me realise how vulnerable women giving birth are.</p>
      <p>“I tried to rest during early labour when the midwife sent me home, but I couldn’t sleep. I was so relieved and emotional when Oli was born that I fell asleep giving him a cuddle.”</p>
