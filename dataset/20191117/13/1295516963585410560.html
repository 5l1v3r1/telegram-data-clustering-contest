      <h1>Who Are the Nine Titans? Attack On Titan’s Strongest Powers, Explained</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:11:26+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">Anthony Gramuglia</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/attack-on-titan/">Attack on Titan</a>'s Nine Titans are the most powerful entities in the entire world of this post-apocalyptic fantasy anime. Descending from <a href="https://www.cbr.com/attack-on-titan-controversial-origin-titans/">the original Titan, Ymir Fritz</a>, the Nine Titans are roles that are passed down from generation to generation, each with their own unique abilities. Naturally, with a set of powers like these, these Titans have legendary status.</p>
      <p>When Ymir Fritz died, her abilities passed through into the Fritz family line, which later extended to the Reiss family and others of noble birth. While Titans can be found across the world, the powers of the Nine outrank the rest. Some, once the host has been devoured and their Titan power assimilated, can even carry multiple powers at once, and one individual in <i>Attack On Titan</i> is currently amassing a greater deal of proportion than most. However, all those who inherit one of the Nine Titans' powers also inherit the Curse of Ymir: a shortened life-sentence. After all, the brightest flames always burn fastest.</p>

      <p>Regardless, the Nine Titans remain the strongest around, though their numbers have recently been whittled down to a few select individuals.</p>

      <h3>THE FOUNDING TITAN</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1-1-1.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=482&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>When Ymir became the first Founding Titan, she harnessed the ability to control other Titans. From Ymir's bloodline, all other Titans emerged; creating an entire race of people with the latent ability to become the monsters. The original plan set forth by Eren's father, Grisha Jaeger, was to become the Founding Titan in order to dominate the will of all other Titans for his own purposes. However, when <a href="https://www.cbr.com/attack-on-titan-that-day-eren-family-secrets/">Eren ultimately devoured his old man</a>, he gained the powers of the Founding Titan...</p>
      <p>... Or, so it seemed. The powers of the Founding Titan are passed down via royal blood, so anyone who inherits the powers without royal blood can't actually access the abilities. However, after encountering his half-brother, Zeke, Eren developed the ability to, on occasion, control other Titans, including the Titans inside the walls around Eldia. In addition, due to these powers, he can recover from lethal attacks, such as having his head blown off.</p>
      <h3>THE ATTACK TITAN</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/eren-attack-on-titan.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=541&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The Attack Titan is one of the most vicious and violent Titans around. On top of the strength and might of an already powerful Titan, this entity can receive and interpret memories of its past incarnations, as well as <a href="https://www.cbr.com/attack-on-titan-new-titan-power/">memories of future events</a>. These memories direct the actions of the Attack Titan, pushing it to fight for freedom and justice.</p>
      <p>The prior owner of the Attack Titan's abilities was Eren Kruger, who, knowing the future incarnation of the Attack Titan, deliberately passed down his abilities to Grisha Jaeger, Eren's father, informing him of the future individuals who would become the Attack Titan, well aware that this might one day bring revolution to the world.</p>
      <p>The more Eren uses the powers of the Attack Titan, the more control he has over his abilities, being able to pierce through all obstacles with his colossal strength and power.</p>
      <h3>THE COLOSSAL TITAN</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/attack-on-titan-live-cartoon.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>One of the first Titans we see in the series, this skinless giant has the power to evaporate parts of its body to release great quantities of steam, which can burn and melt objects around it with its heat. It stands far, <i>far</i> taller than all of its compatriots, being one of the biggest titans around at 60 meters in height!</p>

      <p>Bertolt Hoover was the previous owner of this immense power, giving him enough strength to kick down Wall Maria with one strike. However, eventually, Bertolt met his end, and his powers were <a href="https://www.cbr.com/attack-on-titan-delivers-the-shows-biggest-gut-punch-moment-yet/">passed to Armin Arlert</a>, whose Colossal Titan form (also known as the Colossus Titan) while massive, is also far more gaunt and less physically hot than his predecessor.</p>
      <h3>THE FEMALE TITAN</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Annie-Leonhart-Female-Titan-header.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The only distinctly female Titan among the Nine, the female Titan remains one of the most powerful around. By screaming, it can draw in Pure Titans to her beck and call -- though it can't control them in the way that the Founding Titan can. It can also harden parts of its body to use as a weapon.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.cbr.com/female-titan-annie-leonhart/">current Female Titan is Annie Leonhart</a>, a refined combatant who uses her skills with martial arts and crystalline body to make it into the ultimate weapon. She is the first of the other Nine Titans Eren faces off against, and the two barely survive their encounter. However, due to the Curse of Ymir, Annie has very little time left on this Earth left to live at all.</p>
      <h3>THE ARMORED TITAN</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Armored-Titan.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Taking the Female Titan's ability to form crystalline armor, the Armored Titan takes this to a whole new level. It's able to develop a suit of armor all over its body, turning itself into a Titan left completely impenetrable, except for vital points of articulation necessary for movement.</p>
      <p>The current wielder of the Armored Titan ability is Reiner Braun, who first helped bring down the walls surrounding Eldia with a running start, charging at it like a football lineman.</p>
      <h3>THE BEAST TITAN</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/The-Beast-Titan.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>This monstrous Titan possesses the ability of animal-like strength and appearance. It's most notable for its abilities to throw any item within reach as far as it wishes -- and with disturbing accuracy. At 17 meters in height, many regard the Beast Titan to rank among the strongest Titans around.</p>

        <a href="https://screenrant.com/attack-titan-colossal-titan-height/"/>

      <p>This hairy monster is able to overpower the Armored Titan with ease, thanks to its beastly power. Currently, the Beast Titan powers reside within Zeke Jaeger, the half-brother of Eren. This adversary has long-manipulated the circumstances of humanity and Titans on behalf of its masters.</p>
      <h3>THE JAW TITAN</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Entry-6-Eren-Forces-the-Jaw-Titan-to-Kill-the-War-Hammer-Titan.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The Jaw Titan serves as a dentist's worst nightmare. As one of the smallest and swiftest of the Nine Titans, its abilities allow it to crush and shred any and all things between its teeth and claws.</p>
      <p>Originally, this power belonged to Marcell Galliard, but following his demise, the powers have since been passed down to Ymir (not Fritz) and then to Falco Grice, who has yet to utilize these powers in the pages of <i>Attack on Titan</i>.</p>
      <h3>THE CART TITAN</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cart-Titan.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Another remarkably small Titan, this four-legged "giant" stands at only four meters. It's known for its bizarrely canine appearance and ability to remain transformed for long stretches of time -- with two months at a time being its record before its is forced to return to normal.</p>
      <p>While masculine in appearance, the current Cart Titan is Pieck, a sweet woman who, due to her long stretches in Titan form, has found that walking on all fours is actually more comfortable for her than not.</p>
      <h3>THE WAR HAMMER TITAN</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Entry-7-The-War-Hammer-Titan-Operating-Her-Body-From-a-Distance.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The last of the Nine Titans is the War Hammer Titan -- a titan able to create weapons from its calcified flesh. This includes swords, clubs, and, yes, war hammers. Rather than its host transforming into the Titan, the War Hammer Titan can be created and controlled from a distance by a "flesh cord," creating a Titan body while the real intelligence sits comfortably away.</p>
      <p>Originally controlled by the younger sister of Willy, Eren found her and devoured her, obtaining the powers of the War Hammer Titan. This marks the first time any individual has ever controlled more than two of the Nine Titan powers, making Eren even more unique. If he consolidates more powers, he might prove too powerful for his own good.</p>
