      <h1>Russia refuse to wear new kit for Euro 2020 qualifier after Adidas design inverts country’s flag</h1>
      <h2>The design of the new shirt inverts the nation’s horizontal tricolour of white, dark blue and red, instead closer resembling the flag of Serbia</h2>

      <p>Russia’s national team refused to wear their new <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Adidas">Adidas</a> kit in a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Euro_2020">Euro 2020</a> qualification match against Belgium on Saturday, because of the design of the shirt erroneously inverting the nation’s flag.</p>
      <p>The new kit was revealed two weeks ago by Adidas and is already on general sale. The shirt is predominantly red, with a white collar and blue and white accents on the sleeves.</p>
      <p>However, the design of the sleeves inverts the nation’s horizontal tricolour of white, dark blue and red, instead closer resembling the flag of Serbia.</p>
      <p>The design has been poorly received in Russia, with the national team publishing a statement last week insisting they would not wear the strip for their international against Belgium.</p>
      <p>“In the upcoming games, the Russian national team will continue using the kit in which it began the qualifying round,” the Russian Football Union told AFP.</p>

      <p>And the team made good on their promise, instead wearing their 2018 World Cup kit in the match against Belgium in Saint Petersburg, which they lost 4-1.</p>
      <p>Russia head coach Stanislav Cherchesov had initially attempted to defend the new kit, although the strip will now likely be redesigned ahead of next summer’s European Championship.</p>
      <p>At the launch of the kit, he said: “When fans support the team by clapping with their arms in the air, you’ll be able to see the Russian flag on the sleeves.”</p>
      <p>Despite their heavy defeat by Belgium, Russia have already secured their place at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>They play their final match of the qualification campaign, against European minnows San Marino, in Serravalle on Tuesday.</p>
