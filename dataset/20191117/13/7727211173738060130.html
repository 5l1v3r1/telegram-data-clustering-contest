      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/rolex-watches-yeezy-trainers-lock-14568969">Wilsons Auctions</a> is responsible for selling off the ill-gotten gains seized by police forces around the country including Merseyside, with this month's auction taking place in Newport on November 20.</p>

      <p>This includes a two-storey holiday home in Croatia with a guide price of £90,000, a Mercedes Benz A250 and a pair of Gucci shoes.</p>
