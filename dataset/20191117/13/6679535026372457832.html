      <p>The body of an eight-year-old boy was recovered on Sunday from his home at Dharmaram under Dichpally police station limits.</p>
      <p>The younger son of daily wage earners Jannepally Ashok and Sunitha, Jannepally Rajesh was found with a deep mark on his throat suggesting he may have died due to hanging. Police registered a case based on the complaints and suspicion of villagers that Sunitha herself hanged her son to death due to family disputes.</p>
      <p>CI of Police Venkateswarlu said Sunitha and Ashok’s versions of the death did not match while the villagers’ account was also starkly different from the couple’s.</p>
      <p>Assistant CP G. Srinivaskumar visited the spot and the body was shifted to the Government General Hospital for post-mortem exam.</p>
