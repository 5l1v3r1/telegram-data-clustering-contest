      <p>Italy coach Conor O’Shea has resigned with immediate effect six months before his contract was due to expire, the Italian Rugby Federation (FIR) has announced.</p>
      <p>The former Ireland fullback, who has been linked in the media with a post in the England set-up, took charge of Azzurri in March 2016 and was contracted to stay in the job until the end of May 2020.</p>
      <p>“I loved every minute I spent in Italy and I really believe in what we have done,” O’Shea said in an FIR news release.</p>
      <p>“We have started a process and generated a new, well-founded hope but I also believe that the end of the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> represents the best time for everyone to make changes.”</p>
      <p>Italy won nine and lost 31 of 40 Tests under O’Shea, losing all of their Six Nations fixtures and failing to get out of their opening-round pool at the World Cup.</p>
      <p>O’Shea had a wider remit than just running the Test side, however, and believes he has made good progress in setting up the structures to allow the Italian game to flourish.</p>
      <p>“The youngsters who are coming in are joining a system that can only improve in the years to come if the right decisions continue to be made,” O’Shea added.</p>
      <p>“The job of all of us is to leave the shirt in a better place than the one in which we found it (and) I sincerely hope I have left the Italian rugby in a better position.”</p>
      <p>The Daily Telegraph last month reported that O’Shea would be installed in a new post at England’s Rugby Football Union (RFU) before the start of the 2020 Six Nations, working closely with head coach <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Eddie+Jones">Eddie Jones</a>.</p>
      <p>“We are saddened by Conor’s decision not to complete the journey as contractually intended,” FIR president <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Alfredo+Gavazzi">Alfredo Gavazzi</a> said.</p>
      <p>“We thank him for the commitment and passion with which he has performed his role and we wish him the best for the future.”</p>
