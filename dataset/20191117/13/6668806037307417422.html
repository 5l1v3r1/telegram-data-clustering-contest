      <h1>Shilpa Shetty steps out for lunch with husband Raj Kundra and son Viaan Raj Kundra</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:10:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.filmfare.com/search/author_Kajol_Mathur" target="_blank">Kajol Mathur</a></address>
      <p>Fact that Shilpa Shetty is a superwoman is something nobody can deny. The good looking actress who mostly keeps busy with her work schedules makes sure to spend good time with her family and often head out. Continuing her ritual of Sunday lunch, we snapped the diva at a Mumbai restaurant where she was accompanied by husband Raj Kundra and son Viaan Raj Kundra. Though usually we also snap her mother Sunanda Shetty and sister Shilpa Shetty with them but this time it was just the trio.</p>
      <p>Turning heads effortlessly, Shilpa opted for a one-shoulder printed dress which she paired with a classic Fendi bag and nude heels. Meanwhile, Raj Kundra kept it casual in a blue t-shirt which he paired with denim and black shoes. Looking adorable was little Viaan Kundra who opted for a denim on denim look. We must say, quite a stylish family!</p>
      <p>Check out their pictures below.</p>
