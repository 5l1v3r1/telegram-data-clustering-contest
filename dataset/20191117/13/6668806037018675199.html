      <p>Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan yesterday hosted a grand bash for their daughter Aaradhya Bachchan who turned eight. Present for the celebrations were several Bollywood stars like Shah Rukh Khan, Gauri Khan along with their son AbRam Khan, Sonali Bendre with husband Goldie Behl and son Ranveer Behl, Karan Johar with kids Yash Johar and Roohi Johar,  Adar and Natasha Poonawalla, Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia D’Souza with their kids and photographer Daboo Ratnani with wife Manisha D Ratnani and his three children, Myrah, Kiara and Shivaan.</p>
      <p>Looking adorable, Aaradhya was seen donning a pink ball gown with an extended flower, making her look just like a princess. Even though the Bachchan family decided not to share any inside pictures on their social media handles, thanks to fan accounts we got a glimpse of all the fun that happened yesterday. In a series of pictures, the birthday girl can be seen cutting the cake with her parents and grandparents – Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan and later enjoying a ride on the Ferris wheel.</p>
      <p>Aaradhya along with mamma Aishwarya was also seen cutely posing with Daboo Ratnani’s kids. What we loved was how Abhishek and Aishwarya also joined Aaradhya for a ride on the Ferris wheel and having a blast doing so. Take a look at all the inside pictures here…</p>

      <p>One look at these pictures and it’s easy to say that the Bachchans were a perfect host last night. Meanwhile, on the work front, Abhishek last appeared in Anurag Kashyap’s Manmarziyaan alongside Taapsee Pannu and Vicky Kaushal. He will next be seen in Gulab Jamun opposite ladylove Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.</p>
