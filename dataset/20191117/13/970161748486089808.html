      <h1>Ridley Scott, worth $400m, still gets the bus as he teaches us to be thrifty</h1>

      <p>Ridley Scott, who is estimated to be worth $400million (£309million), was spotted catching the 46 in north London recently, in the latest celebrities: they’re just like us moment.</p>
      <p>Which makes us think that perhaps all those Ubers are standing in between us and a $400m fortune, right?</p>
      <p>The 81-year-old Hollywood star, who is behind classic films such as Gladiator, Blade Runner and Thelma And Louise was spotted on Friday getting thrifty with his transport and going the public route care of TFL.</p>
      <p>Wrapped up against the bitter London chill, the director was photographed heading towards a local bus stop, wearing a big, woolly coat and jeans as he toted a big bag.</p>
      <p>Soon the bus turned up, and Ridley had a chat with a fellow commuter as they hopped on board and swiped their passes.</p>

      <p>Do you reckon Ridley uses an Oyster card or goes for the Contactless? These are the questions we have now we know this transport information.</p>

      <p>Ridley – who splits his time between his homes in London, France, and Los Angeles – found his fame in Hollywood in the 70s after, in 1968, he founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA) alongside his brother Tony, a film and television advertising commercials production company.</p>

      <p>His film, Alien, directed in 1979, was a box office smash and firmly cemented him as directing gold in Tinseltown. Since then he’s been nominated for three Academy Awards over the years.</p>

      <p>At the box office Alien took in $99m (£75m), which, adjusted for inflation, would be around the $350m (£271m) mark in 2019.</p>
      <p>He’ll soon be heading back to Gladiator territory after a sequel to the 2000 film starring Russell Crowe was announced earlier this year.</p>
      <p>At the time, Gladiator took in $400m (£309m) at the box office and was nominated for 11 Oscars. No way there can be another Maximus (played by Russell) but we’re open to suggestions…</p>
      <p>Anyway, the royalties still coming in for that would surely afford Ridley his own driver to take him on his errands…or at least a few Uber Pools to the city. Still, we’re taking budgeting notes.</p>
