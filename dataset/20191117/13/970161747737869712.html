      <p>A Labour election candidate has been accused of running a secret Facebook group to help party members defend themselves against accusations of anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>Maria Carroll, standing in the marginal seat of Camarthen East in Wales, was found to be the co-founder and administrator of a page which advises Labour members accused of anti-Semitism on how to avoid expulsion from the party.</p>
      <p>She had personally advised members who had spouted views including Holocaust denial on social media, the Mail on Sunday reports.</p>
      <p>Ms Carroll denies the existence of any such posts.</p>
      <p>One member of the group, Peterborough Council Labour candidate Alan Bull, was said to have shared posts on Facebook claiming ‘the murder of six million Jews is a hoax’.</p>
      <p>Another of his posts claimed Tony Blair’s New Labour was a ‘Mossad front’ and that Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, murdered Princess Diana.</p>

      <p>Mr Bull, who was selected as a council candidate in 2017, initially said his posts were ‘doctored’ before admitting they were ‘a bad mistake’.</p>
      <p>Labour’s Compliance Unit investigated him after receiving two complaints, during which time he was allegedly advised on Ms Carroll’s Facebook group.</p>

      <p>The newspaper claims Ms Carroll urged Mr Bull to delete all his social media posts about his case, while her co-administrator on the group, Caroline Tipler, told him to submit a request to Labour under the Data Protection Act to give him access to any information the party held on him and to refuse to cooperate unless it did so.</p>
      <p>Labour Against Antisemitism and Gnasherjew, a group of investigators who quit Labour over anti-Semitism allegations, said the Facebook group’s 400 members included councillors, candidates and party officials.</p>
      <p>Gnasherjew claimed hundreds of screenshots of offending posts had been taken and some will be shared on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Another alleged member of the group, Mollie Collins, was exposed by Gnasherjew in August as having shared a series of posts spouting holocaust denials and violent conspiracy theories about the Rothschilds, the Jewish banking dynasty.</p>
      <p>Ms Collins has stood as a Labour county council candidate and until July was chair of Dorset Labour. Her posts dated back to 2015 and were set to public, meaning any Facebook user could see them.</p>

      <p>Ms Collins claimed on Saturday that her posts had been fabricated by ‘Corbynsceptics’ using ‘military grade artificial intelligence’ and she had recently resigned from the party, according to the Mail.</p>

      <p>Denny Taylor, spokesperson for Labour Against Antisemitism, said: ‘These revelations confirm that the Labour Party appears to have spent the last four years apparently encouraging a toxic culture of anti-Jewish discrimination to flourish.</p>
      <p>‘If true responsibility for this must be levelled directly at Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>‘That an alleged network of high ranking Labour officials appear to have been secretly colluding to protect antisemitic members from expulsion is no surprise.</p>
      <p>‘What is alarming is the apparent depth and scale of the network, and the seniority of some of the figures mentioned.’</p>
