      <h1>Make Reading Articles On The Web Less Distracting With This Chrome Extension</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/author/emily-price" target="_blank">Emily Price</a></address>
      <p>Sometimes reading articles on the web can be distracting. Taking notes about what you’re reading can also get pretty complicated, depending on how involved that article is. <a href="https://readermode.io/">Readermode</a> is a Chrome extension that can help. Once enabled, the extension allows you to customise how you see an article on the web and highlight and annotate directly on the article so you can go back to the important parts later on.</p>
      <p>The extension was designed with dyslexics in mind to make reading easier.</p>
      <p>On a basic level, an article theme feature allows you to choose the font, text size, text colour, and background colour you’d prefer to read an article in. You can also toggle off things like an article footer or photos.</p>
      <p>As you read, you can highlight portions of the text you’d like to remember as you go. Built-in Google Translation can help you with any spots that might be in a foreign language, and a Notes List will group together all the notes you take while you’re reading so you can easily find them later.</p>

      <p>The dyslexia tools are one of the places the extension really shines. With those, you can choose between a number of different fonts designed specifically for dyslexics. As you read articles, a dyslexia ruler can be used to help keep you on track, and a text-to-speech function can highlight individual words as it reads aloud so you can follow along as it goes.</p>
      <p>Most of the features are free to use for everyone. If you want things like Google Translate and built-in Google Search capabilities there’s a one-time $US15 ($22) fee for the Pro version.</p>
