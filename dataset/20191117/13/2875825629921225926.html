      <h1>Jose Mourinho 'makes admission to friends' over Tottenham job amid Mauricio Pochettino pressure</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho has been tipped to return to management in the Premier League with Tottenham said to be on his radar as a potential option</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:00:15+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has reportedly admitted to friends he would consider taking over as <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> boss - despite strong links to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10360791/jose-mourinho-tottenham-pochettino-real-madrid/">The Sun</a> claim Mourinho reckons a return to the Bernabeu would be his if he wants it as Zinedine Zidane struggles to turn around their fortunes.</p>
      <p>But despite his confidence in being offered the job, he is keeping a close eye on the situation at Tottenham with Mauricio Pochettino still under pressure.</p>
      <p>He could opt to turn down Los Blancos in order to keep alive the chance of taking over at Spurs to get another crack at the Premier League.</p>

      <p>Mourinho, who has been out of the dugout since his <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> sacking last December, is said to be holding out for a Premier League return.</p>
      <p>He is believed to be particularly interested in north London giants <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> and Tottenham given his location in the capital.</p>
      <p>Whilst links to replace Unai Emery have been strong, he also has an interest in the Spurs top job with Pochettino struggling to turn things around.</p>

      <p>Last year's losing Champions League finalists sit 14th in the Premier League table after a miserable start.</p>
      <p>And Mourinho realises their options could be limited if they move on from Pochettino putting him in the frame to be tasked with turning things around.</p>
      <p>Pochettino has also been strongly linked with Real Madrid in the past, and could be free to join the club Mourinho managed between 2010 and 2013.</p>
