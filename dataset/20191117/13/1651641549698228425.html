      <p>Facebook was testing a new Popular Photos feature that makes it a lot more like Instagram.</p>
      <p>In essence, Popular Photos was a feature that would let users scroll through photos posted by friends in a never-ending feed as if they were on photo platforms like Instagram, Flickr or VSCO. If you’ve used the firm’s Related Videos feature, it was more or less the same philosophy, just adapted for photos.</p>
      <p>Facebook owns Instagram already, but it’s not above cannibalising its own products. The firm has three messaging apps (Messenger, WhatsApp, Threads), thee Story platforms, and so on. It also makes sense when one considers targeted demographics. Users who use Instagram may not necessarily be on Facebook, and some users may use Facebook more often than Instagram and miss out on the photo experience. On a meta-level, it’s all Facebook one could argue. But when it comes to users there’s probably no overlap for those who are using those duplicated services.</p>
