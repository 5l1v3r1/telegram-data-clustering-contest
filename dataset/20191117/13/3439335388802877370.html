      <p>PROVO, Utah &gt;&gt; Zach Wilson passed for 187 yards, two touchdowns and an interception to help BYU beat Idaho State 42-10 today.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the victory, BYU announced on Twitter that it had officially accepted an invitation to play in the Hawaii Bowl on Dec. 24. The Cougars will face a team from either the American Athletic Conference or Mountain West at Aloha Stadium.</p>
      <p>“We are looking forward to playing in the SoFi Hawai‘i Bowl,” BYU head coach Kalani Sitake said in a statement. “I’m really proud of our players and pleased they have earned this opportunity to continue to improve as a program and have one more game together with our seniors. Hawai‘i is a wonderful place and dear to my heart. I’m excited to take our team to the islands to experience the warmth of the culture and the Aloha spirit.”</p>
      <p>Wilson returned from a six-week absence due to a fractured thumb and the sophomore quarterback surpassed 3,000 career yards passing against the Bengals. Wilson completed 19 of 31 passes.</p>
      <p>Sione Finau ran 16 times for 102 yards and a touchdown for the Cougars (6-4). Micah Simon led the receivers with seven catches for 76 yards and Talon Shumway caught two touchdown passes.</p>
      <p>Austin Lee returned an interception for a touchdown to open the scoring for BYU in the first quarter and 321-pound defensive lineman Khyiris Tonga ran in a 3-yard TD in the middle of the fourth.</p>
      <p>Malakai Rango carried 24 times for 142 yards and a touchdown for the Bengals (3-8).</p>
