      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has refused to say whether or not he wants Britain to leave the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/european-union/">European Union</a>, saying it’s up to the public to decide.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show his party will hold another referendum on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> if they win the General Election.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘We’re going to put that choice to the British people, and they will make their decision.</p>

      <p>‘We’ll negotiate within three months a credible, sensible option of Leave, and put that alongside Remain in a referendum.’</p>
      <p>He added that he wants a close relationship with the EU in the future when pressed on his personal view on whether or not the UK should leave.</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn said a Labour government will negotiate a sensible leave deal within three months of taking power and then voters will get the chance to decide again on Brexit.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘The answer is, as I’ve explained to you, that we will negotiate a credible option of leaving, put that alongside Remain, and the British people would make their mind up on that basis, and we will discuss this obviously when we’ve concluded those initial negotiations which will start immediately we take office.’</p>
      <p>He denied suggestions he was unable to say whether or not he would prefer for the UK to be in or out.</p>
      <p>He responded: ‘Jeremy Corbyn can say this – that we have to have a close trading relationship with Europe, we won’t crash out into the arms of Donald Trump, we won’t be doing sweetheart trade deals with the USA, and we won’t be wrecking our National Health Service in the process as the Prime Minister is planning to do.’</p>
      <p>He announced that the party’s manifesto will be published on Thursday after being pressed on the party’s position on the free movement of people.</p>

      <p>‘You’ll have to wait until Thursday to see the wording of it,’ Mr Corbyn said.</p>

      <p>Earlier on the programme, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Mr Marr he does not think it is remotely likely that the UK will leave the EU without a deal.</p>
      <p>Mr Raab insisted the UK is ‘not going to align ourselves to EU rules’, adding: ‘There’s going to be a negotiation, of course there are going to be compromises on all sides.’</p>
