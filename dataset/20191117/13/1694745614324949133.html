      <p>The Instant Pot and the slow cooker may look alike, but they function a lot differently. The name of each appliance says it all — slow-cooked food takes hours, while the Instant Pot knocks it out quickly. So when you're converting a slow-cooker recipe to an Instant Pot, there are a few things to consider. Keep these conversions in mind the next time you whip out your <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/What-Instant-Pot-43097511">Instant Pot</a> for a quick and easy dinner.</p>
      <h3>1. Lower the Meat-Cooking Time</h3>
      <p>One of the best things about the Instant Pot is its ability to cook meat insanely fast — even when frozen. If you're <a href="https://www.kitchenstewardship.com/make-slow-cooker-recipes-for-instant-pot/">converting meat from a slow cooker to an Instant Pot</a>, follow this rule: if the meat dish cooks in eight hours on low or four hours on high in the slow cooker, it will cook in 25-30 minutes in the Instant Pot. Make sure the Instant Pot setting reads "sealing" and not "venting" to ensure it's cooked properly. The "meat/stew" button is great for red meat recipes like <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Slow-Cooker-Bolognese-Sauce-Recipe-34029816">bolognese</a>, and the "poultry" button can be used for chicken dishes like <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Easy-Chicken-Soup-Instant-Pot-43097412">garlic chicken soup</a>. If you're <a href="http://www.superhealthykids.com/the-ultimate-guide-for-making-any-crockpot-recipe-in-an-instant-pot/">cooking meat from frozen in an Instant Pot</a>, just add five or 10 more minutes to the total cook time until it's done.</p>

      <h3>2. Add More Liquid</h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.superhealthykids.com/the-ultimate-guide-for-making-any-crockpot-recipe-in-an-instant-pot/">Instant Pots need more liquid</a> to function properly, so if your recipe doesn't already call for at least a cup of liquid (such as broth or water), add it.</p>
      <h3>3. Skip Certain Ingredients</h3>
      <p>A pressure cooker or Instant Pot won't handle certain ingredients the same way a slow cooker would. If you're making an <a href="http://gnowfglins.com/2017/01/04/how-to-convert-slow-cooker-recipes-to-pressure-cooker-aw056/">Instant Pot meal with milk or dairy</a>, don't add it in the beginning. It can be stirred in or simmered at the end, but it won't cook successfully under pressure. If you're using a thickener, such as a cornstarch slurry, whisk it in at the end as well.</p>
