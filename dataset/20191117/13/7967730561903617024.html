      <h1>Dozens of top roles spilled in shake-up of NSW transport bureaucracy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:02:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:02</time> by <a rel="author">Matt O'Sullivan</a></address>
      <p>NSW's main transport agency has begun a major reshuffle of its senior ranks by spilling dozens of positions as it enters the final stages of folding Roads and Maritime Services into its new divisions and dissolving the standalone roads agency.</p>
      <p>The impact of the reorganisation is rippling through agencies under the control of Transport for NSW, including Sydney Trains, whose chief executive Howard Collins will be seconded to a role overseeing "integrated transport services" for Greater Sydney.</p>
      <p>Internal documents obtained by the <i>Herald</i> show the "proposed top-level structure" for each of the seven divisions within the enlarged Transport for NSW has resulted in at least 25 top-level management roles being spilled.</p>

      <p>The roles of many executive-level managers have disappeared and their names are absent from the proposed structures for each of Transport for NSW's divisions. It means they will have to try their hand at applying for vacancies in the rejigged executive teams.</p>
      <p>The shake-up follows <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p519p1.html">the Berejiklian government's post-election decision to fold Roads and Maritime Services' functions and staff</a> into Transport for NSW, which is headed by Rodd Staples, the architect of Sydney's new metro rail lines.</p>
      <p>One of the divisions, Greater Sydney, is tasked with developing "integrated transport services" and to "be the face of transport" for NSW. Mr Collins will begin the role of Greater Sydney's chief operations officer on February 3.</p>

      <p>Mr Collins, a <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-h0g6th.html">former head of the London Underground</a>, has had one of the highest-profile roles in NSW's transport bureaucracy since he took charge of Sydney's rail network in 2013.</p>
      <p>Stewart Mills, a fellow veteran of London's Underground who heads Sydney Trains' engineering and maintenance, is considered a likely replacement for Mr Collins, although a decision is yet to be made.</p>
      <p>The proposed top-level structure for the Regional and Outer Metropolitan division, which has oversight of NSW TrainLink, shows it has five senior positions that will need to be filled.</p>

      <p>Labor roads spokesman John Graham said he wanted the government to ensure that folding the roads agency into Transport for NSW led to improved transport planning outcomes for the public. "We want to be reassured that there is no chaos inside the agencies or the loss of front-line staff," he said.</p>
      <p>Transport for NSW said the integration of the roads agency was "not about job cuts", and added that changes to the transport bureaucracy's operating model were designed to better integrate "service delivery across all modes [and] driving better customer outcomes".</p>
      <p>"The NSW government has given a solid commitment that there will be no job losses in regional NSW," it said.</p>
      <p>NSW Parliament's lower house last week passed amendments to a bill to dissolve RMS, which includes provisions that non-executive employees of the agency be spared forced redundancies. The bill will now go before Parliament's upper house.</p>
      <p>The State Transit Authority, which falls under Transport for NSW's umbrella, will cease to exist within about 18 months after the<a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p533mt.html"> government last month moved to privatise bus services</a> it operates in Sydney's north-west, lower north shore, northern beaches and eastern suburbs.</p>
