      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:49:20+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>Riteish Deshmukh and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sidharth-malhotra/">Sidharth Malhotra</a> starrer Marjaavaan has collected Rs 14.24 crore after two days of its box office run. The film had opened with Rs 7.03 crore. It earned Rs 7.21 crore on the second day. The Milap Zaveri directorial also stars Tara Sutaria and Rakul Preet Singh.</p>
      <p>Trade analyst Taran Adarsh tweeted the film box office’s figures. He wrote, “#Marjaavaan maintains strong occupancy in mass belt/single screens on Day 2… Metros/multiplexes – average on Day 1 – remain in the same range… Biz should grow on Day 3… Eyes ₹ 22 cr [+/-] weekend… Fri 7.03 cr, Sat 7.21 cr. Total: ₹ 14.24 cr. #India biz.”</p>
      <p>Trade analyst Girish Johar told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a> earlier, “Marjaavan is looking like a commercial masala entertainer. Milap Zaveri is coming with this film after Satyameva Jayate, which was again a mass entertainer. It is after a long time a film is coming which will cater to the B and C towns and the audience of hardcore action drama. Riteish Deshmukh is the key element of this film. He has played a dwarf villain, and he is looking fabulous. The songs have also been appreciated.”</p>

      <p>He added, “Sidharth and Riteish are coming together after Ek Villain. People have liked their combination and they have been appreciated in the past. Milap has also helmed box office hits in the past. Now, it all depends on how the audience find the content of the film.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> film critic Ektaa Malik gave the film only one star. Ektaa wrote in her <b><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/marjaavaan-movie-review-rating-6121582/">review</a></b>, “Sidharth Malhotra tries to play the angry lover who can take on an army alone, but sadly this trope has been perfected by so many actors that Malhotra’s performance seems like a sad parody. Tara Sutaria, as Malhotra’s lady love and as someone who has suffered from the situation in Kashmir, is too perfect with her flawless nude makeup and blow-dried hair to be believable. Also, what is the super-talented Suhasini Mule doing in the film?”</p>
      <p>“Marjaavaan could perhaps be used as a new drinking game, where you raise your glass whenever a melodramatic or a rhyming one-liner is delivered. You will get drunk in the first half-hour itself. Guaranteed,” she added.</p>
