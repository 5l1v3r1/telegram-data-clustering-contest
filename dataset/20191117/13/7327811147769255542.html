      <p>BRIDGETON, New Jersey (WABC) -- A vigil was held Saturday night to mark two months since a 5-year-old girl <a href="https://6abc.com/timeline-the-search-for-5-year-old-dulce-maria-alavez-/5574032/">went missing </a>in New Jersey.</p>
      <p>Family, friends, and community members gathered to keep the search for Dulce Maria Alavez alive.</p>
      <p>Dulce was last seen at the Bridgeton City Park on the afternoon of Sept. 16.</p>
      <p>Dulce and her 3-year-old brother were playing while their mother sat in her car with an 8-year-old relative, but her son soon ran to the car crying and pointed to the area where he last saw his sister.</p>
      <p>Police shared a sketch of a person who they want to talk to as a possible witness.</p>
      <p>There is a $52,000 <a href="https://6abc.com/reward-grows-to-$52k-in-search-for-dulce-maria-alavez/5605881/">reward being offered in the case.</a></p>
