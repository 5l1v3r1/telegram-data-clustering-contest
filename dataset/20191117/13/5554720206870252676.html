      <h1>Anti-Dalit comments made on Arnab Goswami’s show prove costly as demand grows for Ramdev’s arrest</h1>

      <p>Patanjali founder Ramdev on Sunday found himself in the line of fire as Dalit supporters took to social media to demand his arrest for allegedly making insulting remarks against Periyar and followers of noted Dalit icon Dr BR Ambedkar on Arnab Goswami’s show. In a public speech, Ramdev criticised Periyar for his <i>moolniwasi </i>ideology and called him and the supporters of Ambedkar ‘intellectual terrorists.’</p>

      <p>Dalit supporters, who trended hashtags such as #Ramdev_Insults_Periyar and #ArrestRamdev have shared videos of Ramdev’s criticism for Periyar and supporters of Ambedkar calling them ‘intellectual terrorists’. In one interview to Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami, Ramdev is heard saying, “In the name of Ambedkar, some people are propagating the <i>moolniwasi </i>(claiming Dalits are the native Indians and rest having come from outside) concept. Some people from BAMCEF (Dalit group founded by Kanshi Ram) are trying to create a rift. I have coined a term for them and that is ‘intellectual terrorism.”</p>
      <p>In a separate video, Ramdev is seen addressing his followers while criticising Periyar by disparagingly calling him an atheist and criticising his <i>moolniwasi </i>ideology.</p>
      <p>No sooner did the videos of Ramdev allegedly insulting noted Dalit icons emerged, social media users took to Twitter to express their outrage with many demanding the arrest of the Patanjali founder.</p>
      <p>Here’s how they reacted on social media:</p>

      <p>Periyar, often dubbed as South Indian Socrates, was an atheist and helmed social reforms by working against the caste discrimination. The noted Dravidian patriarch had famously said that those who invented the notion of god were fools.</p>
      <p>As for Ambedkar, he’s arguably one of the biggest Dalit icons and was the architect of the Indian constitution.</p>
