      <p>For crispy food without all the grease, air fryers work wonders. This handy appliance acts like an oven, only it circulate hot air more quickly, allowing it to fry, bake, cook, or roast food faster. No oil is used in the cooking process, creating a healthier alternative to deep frying. When shopping for the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-air-fryers/">best large-capacity air fryers</a>, counter space, family size, and functionality are key things to consider.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reviewed.com/cooking/best-right-now/the-best-air-fryers">Large-capacity air fryers</a> are those that feed four or more people in a single use. Keep in mind, these bigger, more family-sized appliances often take up more counter space, but are a convenient way to cook entire meals. For smaller kitchens, a 5-quart fryer with a compact design may be ideal because it can still handle enough food to feed multiple mouths.</p>
      <p>Some air fryers also have built-in extras, including <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-3-best-food-dehydrators-16964936">dehydrators</a>, rotisseries, and even <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-3-best-air-fryer-toaster-ovens-19211449">toaster ovens</a>. While these tend to be on the more pricey side, they allow for even more versatility. When looking for an air fryer, there's also accessories to consider. Among the most useful for cooking are detachable baskets, skewers, or rotisserie shafts, all giving you a more well-equipped kitchen.</p>
      <p>Air fryers come in a range of sizes, but for groups of four or more, you'll want to look for a <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/best-air-fryers/">large-capacity air fryer</a> that's at least 5.8 quarts. The models listed below start there and go all the way up to 10.6 quarts.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>Capacity:</b> 5.8 quarts</p>
      <p>This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GJBBGHG?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-19280668-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B07GJBBGHG">digital air fryer from COSORI</a> has maintained a 4.7-star rating across more than 3,200 Amazon reviewers because of its outstanding features. Its square design allows for more usable cooking space, and the non-stick, BPA-free basket detaches easily from the base, allowing you to move it to where you need to do prep work or load into the dishwasher when you're done. The 11 preset buttons (plus one for preheating) take the guesswork out of trying to figure out ideal time and temperature settings. The "shake reminder" function is handy because it lets you know when to shake the basket for even cooking.</p>
      <p>Users also report that the 100 recipes included with the fryer have also ensured cooking success: "I would be lost without the cookbook," writes one. There's a preheat function, and the temperature range starts at 170 degrees (lower than most fryers) allowing for food to be easily reheated or kept warm. With multiple colors to choose from, this air fryer is a great addition to any kitchen.</p>
      <p>With slightly smaller dimensions than the others listed here, this air fryer takes up less counter space, giving you extra room for prepping food.</p>
      <p><b>What fans say:</b> "I've had this about a week. I've made cake, sweet potato fries, wings and chicken thighs. I love how amazingly crisp and juicy everything is! The presets are extremely accurate and is a great size for 4 good-sized thighs or 12 wings."</p>
