        <b>Karim Benzema's international career with France appears to be over after he requested to be allowed to play for another country he is eligible for instead.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Benzema was suspended indefinitely from the France squad in December 2015 after being charged with conspiracy to blackmail team-mate Mathieu Valbuena over a sextape, but French federation president Noel Le Graet said in October 2016 that coach Didier Deschamps was free to call him up again.</p>
      <p>La Graet has changed his stance, though, insisting on Saturday that Benzema - who remains without an international appearance since the Valbuena affair - is not part of France's plans and the "adventure is over with the French national team".</p>
      <p>Real Madrid striker Benzema, who has been in fine form this season, issued an immediate response on social media, taking aim at La Graet, while offering a way out.</p>

      <p>"Noel, I thought you weren't interfering with the coach's decisions!" Benzema wrote on Twitter. "I want you to know that I and I alone would end my international career.</p>
      <p>"If you think I'm finished, let me play for one of the countries that I'm eligible for and we'll see."</p>
      <p>Benzema was born to Algerian parents but, in 2006, turned down the chance to represent the African nation and, given he has played competitive matches for France, a change of allegiance will be difficult.</p>
