      <p>Last week was another brutal one of NFL game picks and predictions thanks toplenty more surprising results that went against what we thought we know about teams. The only thing we can do is work to make our fearless forecast more formidable for Week 11.</p>
      <p>This week's schedule brings us 14 more games with fourteams enjoyinglate bye weeks. The matchups are still rather compelling, leading with New England and Philadelphia back in action.</p>

      <p>Here's a complete look at our latest pigskin prognostications in managing the number for favorites and underdogs.</p>
      <h3>NFL Week 11 picks, predictions against the spread</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Game of the Week: New England Patriots (<a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/consensus/">-3 1/2</a>) at Philadelphia Eagles</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ETp.m. ET, CBS</p>
      <p>The Patriots usually playwell after a bye under Bill Belichick. The Eagles, however, are coming off a bye themselves, and Doug Pederson did do some great big-game coaching against Belichickin the Super Bowl a couple years ago. Tom Brady has the bigger advantageagainst a bad Eagles secondary while Carson Wentz draws a tough, deep Patriots secondary. Philadelphia will run well enough to stay in the game, but Brady will outduelWentz with agame-winning drive.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Patriots win 27-24 but fail to cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Game of the Midweek: Pittsburgh Steelers at Cleveland Browns (<a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=top%20bar&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-2 1/2</a>)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thursday, 8:20 p.m. ET, Fox, NFL Network, Amazon Prime Video</p>
      <p>The Steelers are coming off massive wins against the Colts and Rams to get into AFC wild-card position behind the Ravens in the North. But the Browns are the ones who have beaten the Ravens, and despite the recent results, Cleveland is equipped betterthan Pittsburgh, especially offensively. The Dawg Pound will be pumped for prime time, and the Browns will continue to save face with a more settled Baker Mayfield outplaying Mason Rudolph.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Browns win 24-20 and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Upset of the Week: Chicago Bears (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">+7</a>) over Los Angeles Rams</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 8:20p.m. ET, NBC</p>
      <p>Mitchell Trubisky used the Lions to break out of a massive slump while Jared Goff went deeper into his struggles against the Steelers. The Bears can run the ball on the Rams to make Trubisky comfortablewhile the Rams facemore tough sledding for Todd Gurley and more pressure on Goff. Chicago should have agood fan presence, as well,Sunday night in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Bears win 23-20.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Lock of the Week: Minnesota Vikings (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-11 1/2</a>) over Denver Broncos</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, CBS</p>
      <p>We picked on the Vikings as mild underdogs at Dallas in Week 10, and they decided to throw that in our face by holding off the Cowboys to get a big win. So now we're making up for that disrespect by expecting them to dominate at home against the Broncos. Bad opponent at home in anearly afternoon game? That's easy pickings for Kirk Cousins.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Vikings win 33-10 and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Dallas Cowboys (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-3 1/2</a>) at Detroit Lions</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, Fox</p>
      <p>The Lions can't stop Ezekiel Elliott or Dak Prescott in anyway, including covering Elliott or Prescott's wide receivers. The Lions also mightbe without Matthew Stafford for another week, and Detroit presents no threat in the running game.One-dimensional, downfield passing doesn't work againstDallas.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Cowboys win 31-14 and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>New Orleans Saints (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-5 1/2</a>) at Tampa Bay Buccaneers</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, Fox</p>
      <p>The Saints will go back to basicsagainst the Bucs after losing to the lowlyFalcons last week. The formula is leaning on their running gameto open things up for Drew Breesdownfield. From there, it's being prepared to swarm Jameis Winston and force key turnovers. Winston has had some success against New Orleans, but it will be Tampa Bay's overall defense that crumbles Sunday.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Saints win 31-21 and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Atlanta Falcons at Carolina Panthers (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-5 1/2</a>)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, Fox</p>
      <p>The Panthers should have no trouble running Christian McCaffrey to another big day, whichwill set up downfield shots to Curtis Samuel and D.J. Moore,receivers whose combined speed and quickness can give the Falcons' secondary trouble. Atlantawill try to play divisional spoiler on the roadin consecutive weeks, but Carolinatends to play better pass defense at home, and itsopponent can'texploit itsweakness in run defense.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Panthers win 30-20 and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Jacksonville Jaguars at Indianapolis Colts (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-3</a>)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, CBS</p>
      <p>Nick Foles returns to start for the Jaguars but steps into a matchup against a defense that performs its best at home. Should Jacoby Brissett miss another game, the Colts might be in trouble with Brian Hoyer against Jacksonville's pass rush and secondary. But let's assume he will playand Indianapolis can grind out a win, this time with better clutch play in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Colts win 23-19 and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>New York Jets at Washington Redskins (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">Pick 'em</a>)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, Fox</p>
      <p>The Jets got a confidence-building win for Sam Darnold and Adam Gase with their defense also making big plays against the Giants. The Redskins will make a ton of mistakes offensively this weekto help New York, while Washington can't stop either Le'Veon Bell or Darnold's veteran receivers.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Jets win 23-16 and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Buffalo Bills (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-5 1/2</a>) at Miami Dolphins</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, CBS</p>
      <p>Buffalo is good at taking care of weak opponents, but ex-Bill Ryan Fitzpatrick has led Miamito two straight wins after scaring his former team on the roadthree weeks ago. Josh Allen will makea few more plays than Fitzmagic this timeto save the day.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Bills win 20-17 but fail to cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Houston Texans at Baltimore Ravens (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-4</a>)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 1p.m. ET, CBS</p>
      <p>This should be fun with Deshaun Watson and Lamar Jackson running wild and throwing deep. But the difference comes down to the Ravens being able to run the ball better in this matchup and having the superior, deeper secondary to limit the deep-ball damage. Watson will make one or two more key turnovers than Jackson, who will keepbuilding his MVP case against another candidate.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Ravens win 31-24 and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Arizona Cardinals at San Francisco 49ers (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-14 1/2</a>)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET, Fox</p>
      <p>The Cardinals made the 49ers sweat in Arizona a couple weeks ago, but even on a short week, San Franciscowill be ready to take care of another division opponent at home in wire-to-wire fashion. The 49ers will fly out of the gate with Jimmy Garoppolo staying hot in this matchup.They'll also run more effectively andget after Kyler Murray more often in the rematch.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: 49ers win 30-13 and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Cincinnati Bengals at Oakland Raiders (<a href="http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-11 1/2</a>)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET, CBS</p>
      <p>The Raiders will just feedJosh Jacobs and watchhim destroy the Bengals' run defense, andDerek Carr also will make some comfortable deep plays off play-action. There's no reason to think this tanking Cincinnati team will be competitive in the Black Hole against a team coming off a long week. Zac Taylor will be schooled by Jon Gruden and his staff.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Raiders win 31-17 and cover the spread.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Kansas City Chiefs (<a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=top%20bar&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">-3 1/2</a>) vs. Los Angeles Chargers in Mexico City</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET, ESPN</p>
      <p>The Chiefs were supposed to play this game in Mexico Cityagainst the other Los Angeles team last season, a shootout they lost in LA, instead. Kansas City will get back on trackwith plenty of Patrick Mahomes,set up well by the running game, ripping apart the Chargers' defense. Philip Rivers will keep slumping against an underrated pass rush, and Melvin Gordon will notrun well enough to save the night.</p>
      <p><b>Pick</b>: Chiefs win 34-27 and cover the spread.</p>
