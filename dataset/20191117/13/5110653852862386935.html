      <h1>Fantasy Football Start 'Em Sit 'Em: Week 11 lineup advice, matchups, DFS picks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:24:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:24</time> by <a rel="author">Vinnie Iyer</a></address>
      <p>The fantasy football playoffs are almost here, and owners everywhere are starting to preface their start 'em, sit 'em questions with "Must-win game..." We'll assume they're all must-win at this point and just deliver the best, most comprehensive lineup advice and NFL DFS picks for Week 11.</p>
      <p>As a reminder, the Giants, Packers, Seahawks, and Titans are on bye this week, and the Chiefs and Chargers play on Monday night in Mexico City. There are a bunch of key injuries, with Brandin Cooks (concussion), Austin Hooper (knee), T.Y. Hilton (calf), Devonta Freeman (foot), A.J. Green (ankle), and George Kittle (knee) either already ruled out or unlikely to play. Mathew Stafford (back) and Adam Thielen (hamstring) are the most important injuries to watch. The good news is that Jacoby Brissett (knee) and Will Fuller (hamstring) are expected to return.</p>

      <h3>Fantasy Football Week 11 Start 'Em: Quarterbacks</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Regular starts</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lamar Jackson, Ravens (vs. HOU), Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs (vs. LAC in Mexico City), Deshaun Watson, Texans (at BAL), Drew Brees, Saints (at TB), Dak Prescott, Cowboys (at DET)</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stronger starts</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Tom Brady, Patriots (at PHI).</b> Expect the Patriots to throw often given the Eagles are strong against the run but weak in the secondary, and he’ll have better, healthier weapons coming off a bye.</p>
      <p><b>Jameis Winston, Buccaneers (vs. NO).</b> He delivered fine against them the first time, and there’s a chance Marshon Latitmore will be out to make the receiving matchups easier for him in what figures to be a high-volume game opposite Drew Brees.</p>
      <p><b>Josh Allen, Bills (at MIA).</b> He’ll do that limited passing and running for touchdowns thing to return good value after going 202 yards and two scores with32 rushing yards in the first meeting.</p>
      <p><b>Matt Ryan, Falcons (at CAR).</b> The Panthers’ secondary is good and their run defense is much worse, but Ryan can put up nice digits against them with his top two wideouts.</p>
      <p><b>Philip Rivers, Chargers (vs. KC in Mexico City).</b> Rivers has been really hard to trust of late with too few touchdowns and too many interceptions, but he should produce with volume opposite Patrick Mahomes in a favorable spot for all his targets.</p>
      <p><b>Jimmy Garoppolo, 49ers (vs. ARI).</b> He ripped them just two weeks ago and should have better help from his targets in the rematch at home.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DFS bargains</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Kyle Allen, Panthers (vs. ATL, $5,300 on DraftKings, $7,200 on FanDuel).</b> Allen plays better at home and is now locked into his three primary targets playing off his elite all-around running back. The Falcons played a lot better against the Saints and can keep up some pressure, but the production can come through in a high-scoring game with some big-play targets.</p>
      <p><b>Derek Carr, Raiders (vs. CIN, $6,100 on DraftKings, $7,400 on FanDuel).</b> The Raiders should be able to run all over the Bengals, but things will open for Carr all over the field in the passing game. He can exploit a bad and thinning secondary with some downfield shots.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Deep streamers</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sam Darnold, Jets (at WAS), Nick Foles, Jaguars (at IND)</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Fantasy Football Week 11 Sit 'Em: Quarterbacks</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Weaker starts</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Jared Goff, Rams (vs. CHI).</b> You can’t go here when he’s struggling to get the ball to even his main healthy wideouts behind an offensive line that’s crumbling with no running game.</p>
      <p><b>Carson Wentz, Eagles (vs. NE).</b> There’s good reason to believe he’ll do better than expected against their pass defense, but Philadelphia ismore of a running team now. Wentz is risky with limited upside, so go elsewhere if you can.</p>
      <p><b>Kirk Cousins, Vikings (vs. DEN).</b> This feels like a Minnesota domination game with plenty of the running and defense, and we know how low-volume games work out for Cousins.</p>
      <p><b>Kyler Murray, Cardinals (at SF).</b> He did very well in the first meeting, but it’s still a rookie on the road against a tired but very angry defense.</p>
      <p><b>Jacoby Brissett, Colts (vs. JAX).</b> He should return over Brian Hoyer, but it’s hard to trust him in this tough matchup with hurting players around him.</p>
      <p><b>Mitchell Trubisky, Bears (at LAR).</b> That was a nice rebound get-well game he put together against the Lions, but you can’t trust him on the road to get you viable fill-in digits.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Fantasy Football Week 11 Start 'Em: Running backs</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Regular starts</b>
      </p>
      <p>Christian McCaffrey, Panthers (vs. ATL), Ezekiel Elliott, Cowboys (at DET), Dalvin Cook, Vikings (vs. DEN), Leonard Fournette, Jaguars (at IND), Melvin Gordon, Chargers (vs. KC in Mexico City), Alvin Kamara, Saints (at TB), Nick Chubb, Browns (vs. PIT), Le'Veon Bell, Jets (at WAS), Marlon Mack, Colts (vs. JAX), Mark Ingram, Ravens (vs. HOU), Josh Jacobs, Raiders (vs. OAK), Todd Gurley, Rams (vs. CHI), James Conner, Steelers (at CLE)</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stronger starts</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Damien Williams, Chiefs (vs. LAC in Mexico City).</b> He’s the lead guy again with LeSean McCoy in Andy Reid’s doghouse, and he can look good in fine matchup.</p>
      <p><b>Austin Ekeler, Chargers (vs. KC in Mexico City).</b> Gordon is back to being featured, but the Chiefs are equally generous to backs in the passing gameand Ekeler keeps finding ways to get it done. This should be a big checkdown game for Rivers.</p>
      <p><b>Tevin Coleman and Raheem Mostert, 49ers (vs. ARI).</b>49ers backs have been underwhelming of late as teams have focused on taking away the run, but they are overdue for a big combined rushing day against a vulnerable defense at home. Mostert should fill in just fine for Matt Breida (ankle).</p>
      <p><b>Joe Mixon, Bengals (at OAK).</b> He somehow got good garbage touches and yards against the Ravens, and the Raiders will be fine giving up that once they lead big, too.</p>
      <p><b>David Montgomery, Bears (at LAR, if he plays).</b> You can run on the Rams, and despite the spread, Chicago is in line for a positive or close game script.</p>
      <p><b>Miles Sanders, Eagles (vs. NE).</b> Don’t be fooled. The Patriots are vulnerable against the run against better offenses. With Jordan Howard out,Sanders can get good power running work on top of trying to stretch the field as a receiver.</p>
      <p><b>James White, Patriots (at PHI).</b> It’s a White type of game with plenty of short passes against the Eagles' meh coverage linebackers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DFS bargains</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Brian Hill, Falcons (at CAR, $4,800 on DraftKings, $5,900 on FanDuel).</b> Devonta Freeman (foot) is hurting, and Hill steps into a great spot start against a struggling Panthers run defense. Take the bingo free space when making your cash or tournament lineups.</p>
      <p><b>Devin Singletary, Bills (at MIA, $6,000 on DraftKings, $6,500 on FanDuel).</b> Here we go again after the disappointment in the ugly defensive game against the Browns. He still should lead in backfield touches in a favorable game script, even if Frank Gore gets some ceremonial work in what might be his last game in Miami.</p>
      <h3>Fantasy Football Week 11 Sit 'Em: Running backs</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Weaker starts</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>David Johnson, Cardinals (at SF).</b> Kenyan Drake might be stealing his job because of health, and it’s unlikely Arizona has the same rushing success in this rematchanyway.</p>
      <p><b>Sony Michel, Patriots (at PHI).</b> He won’t get many touches, as New England knows run defense is Philadelphia’s strength.</p>
      <p><b>Phillip Lindsay and Royce Freeman, Broncos (at MIN).</b> You can’t like their chances against a team that just shut down Zeke on the road.</p>
      <p><b>Ronald Jones, Buccaneers (vs. NO).</b> You cannot run effectively on the Saints, and he won’t do enough in the passing game to compensate.</p>
      <p><b>Adrian Peterson and Derrius Guice, Jets (at WAS).</b> The Jets are surprisingly very good against the run despite their defensive line and linebacker injuries, as Saquon found out the hard way last week.</p>
      <p><b>Carlos Hyde, Texans (at BAL)</b>. This will be a tough spot overall for Houston’s running game.</p>
      <p><b>J.D. McKissic, Lions (vs. DAL).</b> The checkdown production will be hard to come by here against great linebackers.</p>
      <p><b>Kalen Ballage, Dolphins (vs. BUF).</b> He’s getting massive volume, but even in a decent matchup, you can’t like his chances to do something notable.</p>

      <h3>Fantasy Football Week 11 Start 'Em: Wide receivers</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Regular starts</b>
      </p>
      <p>Julio Jones, Falcons (at CAR), Michael Thomas, Saints (at TB), Mike Evans and Chris Godwin,Buccaneers (vs. NO), Tyreek Hill, Chiefs (vs.LAC in Mexico City), Kenny Golladay, Lions (vs. DAL), Amari Cooper, Cowboys (at DET), Odell Beckham Jr., Browns (vs. PT), Cooper Kupp, Rams (vs. CHI), Keenan Allen, Chargers (vs. KC in Mexico City), Stefon Diggs, Vikings (vs. DEN), Allen Robinson, Bears (at LAR) D.J. Moore, Panthers (vs. ATL), Julian Edelman, Patriots (at PHI), DJChark, Jaguars (at IND), Courtland Sutton, Broncos (at DEN).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stronger starts</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Michael Gallup, Cowboys (at DET).</b> He is getting it done opposite Cooper consistently, and the Lions present no real danger with favorable downfield coverage.</p>
      <p><b>John Brown, Bills (at MIA).</b> He was solid in the tough spot last week, and he can lean toward more special this week with no Xavien Howard.</p>
      <p><b>Deebo Samuel, 49ers (vs. ARI).</b> Let’s assume Emmanuel Sanders (ribs) doesn’t play and Samuel stays hot in a great matchup as a clear No. 1.</p>
      <p><b>Tyrell Williams, Raiders (vs. CIN).</b> He’s bound for a big day with a big play and a score playing off the run.</p>
      <p><b>Curtis Samuel, Panthers (vs. ATL).</b> The Falcons get destroyed by speedy deep threats.</p>
      <p><b>Marquise Brown, Ravens (vs. HOU).</b> The Texans get destroyed by speedy deep threats.</p>
      <p><b>Mike Williams, Chargers (vs. KC in Mexico City).</b> They don’t have someone with the size to contain him.</p>
      <p><b>Jamison Crowder, Jets (at WAS).</b> He and Demaryius Thomas have great viability in this matchup against shaky cornerbacks inside and out as Robby Anderson has faded out of fantasy relevance.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DFS Bargains</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Mohamed Sanu, Patriots (at PHI, $5,100 on DraftKings, $5,800 on FanDuel).</b> He’s got it going on with Brady, and he'll rip apart this secondary all over the field with Julian Edelman.</p>
      <p><b>Tyler Boyd, Bengals (at OAK, $5,200 on DraftKings, $5,900 on FanDuel).</b> He had something going with Ryan Finley, and there should be some welcome garbage time in a better matchup again.</p>
      <p><b>Terry McLaurin, Redskins (vs. NYJ, $5,600 on DraftKings, $5,500 on FanDuel).</b> He will get revved up with his fellow Buckeye Dwayne Haskins finally as the Jets have no one to cover rookie receivers of his talented ilk.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Deep sleepers</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ted Ginn Jr., Saints (at TB), Chris Conley, Jaguars (at IND), Hunter Renfrow, Raiders (vs. CIN)</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Fantasy Football Week 11 Sit 'Em: Wide receivers</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Weaker starts</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Christian Kirk, Cardinals (vs. SF).</b> He will cool off majorly against an actual good pass defense.</p>
      <p><b>Alshon Jeffery, Eagles (vs. NE).</b> He might be taken out of the game by fellow Gamecok Stephon Gilmore.</p>
      <p><b>Marvin Jones, Lions (vs. DAL).</b> Golladay is fine with Jeff Driskel, but Jones can hurt you in a tough spot here.</p>
      <p><b>Robert Woods, Rams (vs. CHI).</b> He will cool off outside against their secondary with Goff struggling.</p>
      <p><b>Calvin Ridley, Falcons (at CAR).</b> He is really TD dependent, and this feels like a massive Julio day.</p>
      <p><b>Sammy Watkins, Chiefs (vs. LAC in Mexico City).</b> He has done nothing for you to trust him of late.</p>
      <p><b>Zach Pascal, Colts (vs. JAX).</b> He probably gets big A.J. Bouye as their default top healthy wideout.</p>
      <p><b>DeVante Parker, Dolphins (vs. BUF).</b> Good night against Tre’Davious White.</p>
      <h3>Fantasy Football Week 11 Start 'Em: Tight ends</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Regular starts</b>
      </p>
      <p>Travis Kelce, Chiefs (vs. LAC in Mexico City), George Kittle, 49ers (if he returns vs. ARI), Hunter Henry, Chargers (vs. KC in Mexico City), Darren Waller, Raiders (vs. CIN), Zach Ertz, Eagles (vs. NE)</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stronger starts</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Mark Andrews, Ravens (vs. HOU).</b> You can make big plays downfield against the Texans, and it doesn’t matter that he’s a wide receiver playing tight end.</p>
      <p><b>Jared Cook, Saints (at TB).</b> The Bucs are starting to give up big numbers to the position, and he just had his best game with Drew Brees.</p>
      <p><b>Greg Olsen, Panthers (vs. ATL).</b> He’ll stay very productive at home against an opponent he’s burned plenty in the past.</p>
      <p><b>Gerald Everett, Rams (vs. CHI).</b> You can burn the Bears with good tight end usage, and the Rams need him to step up.</p>
      <p><b>Jack Doyle and Eric Ebron, Colts (at JAX).</b> Take a chance on either to get you decent start-able production, but they're both still very TD-dependent.</p>
      <p><b>O.J. Howard, Buccaneers (vs. NO).</b> He’s relevant again and talented enough to keep it up here.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DFS Bargain</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>T.J. Hockenson, Lions (vs. DAL, $3,600 on DraftKings, $5,300 on FanDuel).</b> The Cowboys are very giving to the position, and he can find the end zone this week.</p>
      <h3>Fantasy Football Week 11 Sit 'Em: Tight ends</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Weaker starts</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Kyle Rudolph, Vikings (vs. DEN).</b> Don’t go chasing numbers that won’t repeat here.</p>
      <p><b>Noah Fant, Broncos (at MIN)</b>. Don’t chase on the other side of the same game, either.</p>
      <p><b>Dallas Goedert, Eagles (vs. NE).</b> He should be more involved along with Zach Ertz, so that helps, but the matchup doesn’t.</p>
      <p><b>Darren Fells, Texans (at BAL).</b> That two-TD thing won’t happen against this deep secondary and improving linebackers.</p>
      <p><b>Mike Gesicki, Dolphins (vs. BUF).</b> The youngster has the worst possible matchup.</p>
      <h3>Fantasy Football Week 11 Start 'Em: Defenses</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Regular starts</b>
      </p>
