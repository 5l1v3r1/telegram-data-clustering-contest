      <p>Rodney’s attorney also <a href="https://www.sohh.com/kim-kardashian-announces-she-stood-by-rodney-reeds-side-when-texas-court-stopped-his-scheduled-execution/">confirmed the massive news</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>Reed’s lawyer, Bryce Benjet, did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment, but said in a <a href="https://time.com/5722795/rodney-reed-innocent-execution-protests/">statement to <i>TIME</i></a>, “We are extremely relieved and thankful that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has issued a stay of execution for our client Rodney Reed.” “This opportunity will allow for proper consideration of the powerful and mounting new evidence of Mr. Reed’s innocence,” his statement added. (PEOPLE)</blockquote>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sohh.com/kim-kardashian-announces-she-stood-by-rodney-reeds-side-when-texas-court-stopped-his-scheduled-execution/">stay of execution</a> came following weeks of people pulling for Rodney Reed to receive a new trial for a crime evidence appears to prove he didn’t commit.</p>
      <blockquote>A Texas prisoner who has long claimed his innocence in the murder of a woman 23 years ago was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/rodney-reed-death-row-texas.html?module=inline">days away from his execution</a> on Friday when an appeals court stepped in to suspend his death sentence indefinitely.  The dramatic decision by the Court of Criminal Appeals in Texas halted the execution of the prisoner, Rodney Reed, and ordered the court where he was originally tried to consider new evidence in the case, including testimony from eyewitnesses who have come forward in recent months pointing toward the victim’s fiancé as another suspect.
