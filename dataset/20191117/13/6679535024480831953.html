      <h1>State’s fiscal crisis likely to continue</h1>
      <h2>Centre refuses to budge on raising annual borrowing limit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:59:27+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/N-J-Nair-893/" target="_blank">N.J. Nair</a></address>
      <p>With the Centre refusing to budge on raising the annual borrowing limit and allegedly ignoring the demand for expeditiously releasing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation arrears, the government remains clueless on tiding over the financial crisis gripping the State.</p>
      <p>Other than the GST compensation arrears of ₹1,600 crore, the annual borrowing limit has been slashed by ₹6,500 crore, forcing the State government to impose curbs on treasury payments. The State government’s efforts to avert a total breakdown have failed and stringent curbs have been imposed on treasury outgo due to paucity of funds.</p>
      <p>Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac told <i>The Hindu</i> on Sunday that unless the Centre responded positively to the State’s twin demands, which he termed quite legitimate, wriggling out of the crisis would not be easy at all.</p>
      <p>The GST compensation is something that the Centre cannot halt at any cost. Still, it has not been released. Further compounding the financial woes of the State, the Centre had been repeatedly deferring the date for filing annual tax returns.</p>
      <p>Initially, the time limit for filing the returns was fixed in August, but subsequently extended to September and now to December. That means the State may again have to wait for a month to assess the returns filed and then initiate action against the recalcitrant traders.</p>
      <p>A mechanism comprising squads headed by tax sleuths to crackdown on tax evaders and also bring to book those who failed to file the returns in time could not swing into action so far. All these could turn active only after the traders filed their returns. The extension of deadline for filing returns was proving deleterious for the State, sources said.</p>
      <p>In the wake of the present crisis, the State government would again have to put the Centre under duress for raising the annual borrowing limit from the current 3% of the State Domestic Product to at least 3.5% and also for keeping externally aided projects outside the limit to mobilise resources.</p>
      <p>But in the current political context, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government was unlikely to take a sympathetic view of the demand and the crisis was unlikely to blow over soon, sources said.</p>
