        <b>A SCOTS military battalion and the SAS have been accused of “murdering children and torturing civilians”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It comes amid reports that evidence linking British soldiers to the alleged crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan was covered up by military bosses.</p>

      <p>Evidence uncovered said the Black Watch had overseen deaths in custody, beatings, torture and degrading sexual abuse, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/army-covered-up-torture-and-child-murder-bfdc5rsmw">according to The Sunday Times</a> after a year-long investigation.</p>
      <p>And they also said that military detectives uncovered evidence of murders by an SAS soldier.</p>
      <p>It is alleged three children and a young man were shot in the head while at their home in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>It was also alleged that there were widespread abuses of prisoners at Camp Stephen in Iraq in 2003, which led to two custody deaths.</p>
      <p>And there were accusations that the fatal shooting of an Iraqi cop in the same year was covered up by a commanding officer using the witness account of a soldier which he later said was fabricated without him knowing about it.</p>
      <p>Military cops found allegations that documents had been falsified – with the accusations serious enough to warrant senior officer prosecutions.</p>
      <p>One senior SAS commander was referred to prosecutors for an attempt to pervert the course of justice.</p>
      <p>The evidence emerged during war crime probes which were wound down in 2017 before reaching trial.</p>
      <p>But the Ministry of Defence has denied they interfered with prosecution decisions.</p>
      <p>They insisted that the military had been held to the “highest standards” while in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>An MOD spokesperson said: “Allegations that the MOD interfered with investigations or prosecution decisions relating to the conduct of UK forces in Iraq and Afghanistan are untrue.</p>
      <p>“Throughout the process the decisions of prosecutors and the investigators have been independent of the MOD and involved external oversight and legal advice.</p>
      <p>“Cases were referred to the Service Prosecuting Authority as a result of investigations in both Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>“Cases from Iraq were referred as a result of historic investigations. It is untrue to claim cases investigated under Operation Northmoor in Afghanistan were not acted upon.</p>
      <p>“After careful investigation, overseen by a former Chief Constable, no Northmoor cases were referred to prosecutors. The Service Police have carried out extensive investigations into allegations about the conduct of UK forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>“The independent Service Prosecuting Authority decided not to prosecute any of the cases referred to it. Our military served with great courage and professionalism in Iraq and Afghanistan and we hold them to the highest standards.</p>
      <p>“It is Government policy that military operations are conducted in accordance with the Law of Armed Conflict and where allegations are raised, they are investigated.</p>
      <p>“The Sunday Times’ claims have been passed to the Service Police and the Service Prosecuting Authority who remain open to considering allegations.”</p>
      <p>But investigators expressed frustration that evidence was shelved for “political reasons”.</p>
      <p>One said: “Key decisions were being taken out of our hands.</p>
      <p>“There was more and more pressure coming from the Ministry of Defence to get cases closed as quickly as possible.”</p>
      <p>Lord Macdonald, an ex-director of public prosecutions, said: “It’s absolutely reprehensible for politicians to take it upon themselves to interfere in investigations into crimes this serious, and to close those investigations down before they’re complete.”</p>
      <p>The shock revelations could see a war crimes investigation by the International Criminal Court.</p>
