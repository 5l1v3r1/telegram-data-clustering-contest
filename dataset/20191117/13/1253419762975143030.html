      <p>Modder ‘Halk Hogan PL’ has released a new video for The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project 11.0. This video showcases the new high quality textures that will be coming in it. Basically, the video compares the vanilla textures with the modded ones, thus giving you an idea of the upcoming visual improvements.</p>
      <p>The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project brings very high quality textures. These new textures come with great sharpness and performance, and without any unnecessary VRAM losses. The mod also packs very high quality accurate normal maps, high quality meshes with a lot of details and better objects LODs.</p>
      <p>This is the second video for version 11.0. In September 2019, the modder <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/videotrailer-news/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-11-0-comparison-video/">released</a> the first comparison video. Therefore, I suggest watching that too as it compares completely different textures.</p>
      <p>The Witcher 3 came out in 2015 and while this HD Texture Pack is significantly improving its textures, the game’s lighting system is definitely showing its age. Still, it’s pretty great witnessing how dedicated its modders actually are.</p>
      <p>There is currently no ETA on when The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project 11.0 will come out.</p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
