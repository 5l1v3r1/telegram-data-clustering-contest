        <b>Manchester United forward Anthony Martial has been accused of once missing a game against Norwich City because he just didn’t fancy playing.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://theathletic.com/1380946/2019/11/17/martial-daniel-taylor/?source=shared-article">The Athletic</a>, the France international has struggled to convince a number of his managers and others he’s worked with that he’s truly capable of forging a successful career for himself due to his mentality.</p>

      <p>Martial is undoubtedly a fine talent on his day, but The Athletic’s piece quotes an unnamed United team-mate of his as saying he essentially skived off a game against Norwich.</p>
      <p>It’s said in the piece that although the former Monaco man missed the game through injury, he was training as normal the following day, with his team-mate quoted as saying he just didn’t fancy playing that day.</p>
      <p>This will undoubtedly be concerning for Man Utd fans, many of whom have really warmed to Martial in his time at Old Trafford.</p>

      <p>The 23-year-old has become a real fan-favourite with MUFC supporters, despite his inconsistent performances.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if Martial can now step up his game and build on some promising recent form to convince everyone else he can be the real deal.</p>
      <p>It would be a sad waste of potential if he doesn’t.</p>
