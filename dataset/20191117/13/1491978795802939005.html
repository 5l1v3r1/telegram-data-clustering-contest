      <h1>Pumarosa: Devastation review – brooding turbo-anguish</h1>

        <i>(Fiction)</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pumarosamusic.com/">Pumarosa</a> have long called their sound “industrial spiritual”, but the London band’s second album takes it to a bracing new level, as they sack off the indie guitars of their 2017 debut <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/21/pumarosa-the-witch-review-magnetic-debut"><i>The Witch </i></a><i/>and embrace obsidian synths. Its title might suggest despair but this is an album about overcoming, and of frontwoman Isabel Muñoz-Newsome confronting desire and her sexuality <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/10/pumarosa-isabel-munoz-newsome-smear-test-embarrassed-cervical-cancer">following her recovery from cervical cancer</a>. It’s not bleak, it’s rather sensual, while musically there is a jagged line between the recent Sleater-Kinney album, its producer St Vincent and Vincent’s usual studio whiz, John Congleton, who is – stay with me – also on <i>Devastation</i> duties.</p>
      <p>And so, Fall Apart and Adam’s Song reach for drum’n’bass (echoes of Pendulum; Portishead), heady trance-pop and squelchy acid on Heaven (echoes of Smalltown Boy), while Lose Control, a galloping goth-pop song and easily their best, shows they’ve got the choruses if they want them (echoes of U2). For some, Pumarosa’s brand of brooding turbo-anguish went out with PVC trousers, but even though the tortured lyrics can feel a little cloying, <i>Devastation</i> is proof that it’s not just Trent Reznor who can play sexy machine-rave and sing about shagging.</p>
