      <p>Another sign, appearing to be part of the protest, was also visible outside of the facility. The sign reads"stand up for the flag" and is surrounded by several small American flags.</p>
      <p>When asked by <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUndefeated/status/1195731520243347457">ESPN's The Undefeated</a>about why he's there, another protestorsaid he wantsto make sure people respectthe flag.</p>
      <p>"I'm not here to disparage anybody, or anything or any organization," he said. "I'm here for one reason, and that's to lift up the big, beautiful flag of the country. I'm not negative at all. There has been some tearing down of the flag, and it's easy to tear things down. It's hard to build something up, so I'm here to lift up the flag today."</p>
