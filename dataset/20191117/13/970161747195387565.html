      <p>The chief executive of Greggs won’t be able to enjoy a Festive Bake this year, as he has now gone vegan.</p>
      <p>Roger Whiteside is three weeks into his new diet, but he didn’t make the change after trying one of the bakery chain’s famous vegan sausage rolls.</p>
      <p>Instead, a documentary on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> called The Gamechangers inspired him to ditch the meat, milk and eggs.</p>
      <p>Mr Whiteside said: ‘If you’d asked me three weeks ago which roll I preferred I would have said the original sausage roll, but I’m now attempting to live on a vegan diet.</p>
      <p>‘Obviously there are arguments based around animal welfare and the environment, but this was all about the health benefits, and I thought I should give it a go.</p>
      <p>‘Avoiding meat is easy. The problem is avoiding dairy, avoiding milk and cheese is almost impossible. It would be okay if I had time to cook, but I don’t, so I have to have things that are quick and easy.’</p>

      <p>Luckily, his new food choices correspond with a potential expansion of the bakery’s vegan range, so he won’t have to starve while visiting the shop floor.</p>

      <p>They have introduced a vegan sweet mine pie in 2016 and also have a Mexican Bean &amp; Sweet Potato Wrap available.</p>
      <p>Mr Whiteside said he’s currently making his way through Greggs’ vegan range, which the firm is looking to expand, potentially adding vegan versions of other best-sellers like its steak bake.</p>
      <p>He spoke about his new regime as he was awarded this year’s North East Business Executive of the Year in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>‘It’s been seven years since I took over as CEO and we’ve spent all that time transforming the business in all sorts of ways, obviously refocusing the business away from traditional bakery to the growing food-on-the-go market,’ he said.</p>

      <p>‘But really all that time has been spent on getting to the start line and what comes next for Greggs is to build on that platform to become truly multi-channel in a digital age.</p>
      <p>‘And there’s so much opportunity to do that, serving customers at all times of the day, everywhere, in every way they want when they’re looking for food and drink away from home.</p>
      <p>‘We’ve already started investing in these new channels – delivery of food, click and collect food, drive-thru lanes, food to order – all of those things are there to be developed by Greggs now.</p>
      <p>‘As well as being market-leaders in bakery, which you’d expect with our heritage, we’re becoming market leaders in areas you’d never have thought of. So we’re already well on the way.’</p>

      <p>‘There’s lots to look forward to.’</p>
