      <h1>Why Tales from the Dark Multiverse: Blackest Night Focuses on Sinestro</h1>

      <p>Geoff Johns and Ivan Reis' <i>Blackest Night </i>ended with Hal Jordan saving the universe after Sinestro gives up the White Lantern ring.<i> <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/tales-from-the-dark-multiverse/">Tales from the Dark Multiverse: Blackest Night</a> </i>reimagined that story with a horrific twist, having Sinestro keep the ring and dooming the universe in the process.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/blackest-night-tim-seeley-interview/">CBR</a>, writer Tim Seeley explained why he decided to focus on Sinestro and make him the central part of the story. While working on the story, the creative team was told to craft a story that ended in failure, despite the fact that it already contained quite a few dark elements. The writers quickly decided that the failure could not rest on Hal's shoulders.</p>

      <p>So the challenge was to try to figure out a character who would sort of epitomizes the failure, and I think we decided it couldn't be Hal, right? Because we've already seen that story," said Seeley. We've seen Hal with Parallax, and we've seen Hal lose morally. And this would just be a repeat, I thought.</p>
      <p>Once they concluded that Hal would not be at the center of the story, they moved on to Sinestro.</p>
      <p>"So I felt like Sinestro would be the guy to do it, because in the original <i>Blackest Night</i>, Sinestro kind of redeems himself, because he ultimately sort of realizes that he's not the guy to defend life, at least that's one way I think you could interpret it" he continued. "So, I felt like, instead it'd be the failure of Sinestro. He almost made himself someone who wasn't selfish all the time in that story, and this one had to say, 'Nope, this is where he was... the man that he always expected that he was. He was the one that failed the entirety of humanity, which is all life. It was him who failed.'"</p>
