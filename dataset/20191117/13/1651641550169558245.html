      <h1>More details about the camera of the upcoming Galaxy S11 leak online</h1>

      <p>The Galaxy S11 will be Samsung’s first flagship smartphone that will go on sale in early 2020 and even though we’re still a few months away from the release date, rumors have already started doing the rounds, suggesting that the Galaxy S11 smartphone will be equipped with a lot of <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-camera-app-to-get-directors-view-mode-night-hyperlapse-single-take-photo-and-more/">useful camera features</a>. Some are also saying that Samsung will rely heavily upon the upcoming Galaxy S11 to re-claim the camera supremacy that it has recently lost to Apple and Google.</p>
      <p>It turns out that all those rumors are true — Samsung is working towards introducing a lot of interesting changes to the camera of the S11 and thanks to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-camera-app-8k-video-209-aspect-ratio-108mp/"><i>XDA’s</i></a> APK teardown of the camera app, we now know exactly what Samsung is currently working on.</p>
      <p>It’s found that support for 8K video recording has been added in the One UI 2.0 beta 4 update. This isn’t surprising given the fact that the latest Exynos 990 SoC from Samsung has support for 8K@30fps video.</p>
      <p>In order for a camera to capture higher pixels, the camera must have a higher pixel count and keeping that in mind, Samsung is planning a huge 108MP camera sensor, most probably for its upcoming Galaxy S11 smartphone. This <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/first-details-of-the-camera-of-the-samsung-galaxy-s11-leaked-online/">buttresses our previous claim</a>, where we said that there is a high degree of probability that the Galaxy S11 will use a 108MP image sensor.</p>
      <p>In the APK teardown, there was a reference to a 20:9 aspect ratio and this too, goes in line with what we said about the aspect ratio of the upcoming Galaxy S11.</p>
      <p>While the APK teardown didn’t talk anything about the device on which these new features will be made available, similarities between what we’ve been hearing about the S11 for a few months and what we’ve heard just now are a strong indication that these features are going to come to the upcoming Galaxy S11 smartphone first.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy S11 is expected to be Samsung’s first flagship smartphone of the year 2020 and as usual, the expectation is also quite high.</p>
