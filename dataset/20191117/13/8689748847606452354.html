      <p>Sarkodie just knows how to subtly shade and he proved it once again at the 2019 MTN 4Sye Music Video Awards which happened last night at the Kempinski Hotel, Accra.</p>
      <p>When Sarkodie dropped the song titled ‘Advice’ which was a diss song to Shatta Wale for attacking him in the media for weeks, it came with a freestyle video in which the rapper wore a white classic shirt and with him sipping some champagne in a wine glass.</p>
      <p>After a year since the song was released, Shatta Wale is still not cool with his former friend and still describes him as a hypocrite and although industry persons have tried uniting them, it’s not worked.</p>
      <p>Sarkodie seems unperturbed and at the 2019 MTN 4Syte Music Video Awards, the ‘Saara’ hitmaker decided to help Shatta Wale reminisce that moment last year so decided to bring that wine glass on stage with some champagne in it.</p>
      <p>You can guess how Shatta Wale must have felt seeing Sarkodie holding that famous glass with champagne in it.</p>
      <p>Ah Sarkodie paaaa—Why do that to bra Nii?</p>
