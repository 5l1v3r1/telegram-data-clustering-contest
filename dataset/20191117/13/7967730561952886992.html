      <p>The federal government's Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Atlassian billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes have teamed up to back a new $30 million venture capital fund targeting the "agrifood" sector.</p>
      <p>The CEFC and Mr Cannon-Brookes' personal investment fund, Grok Ventures, have each committed $8 million to Tenacious Ventures, which describes itself as "Australia’s first dedicated agrifood tech venture capital firm".</p>

      <p>Tenacious Ventures is seeking to raise $30 million and is led by Matthew Pryor, who helped found agrifood tech startup Observant, which was sold to India's Jain Irrigation in 2017; and Sarah Nolet, CEO of agrifood tech advisory firm AgThentic.</p>
      <p>The fund plans to invest in early-stage startups focused on the agricultural supply chain and which are trying to lift farm efficiency and reduce waste.</p>
      <p>The global agricultural sector accounts for about 14 per cent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. Mr Cannon-Brookes said in a statement: "Innovation in agriculture is desperately needed across the world to make our planet more sustainable.</p>

      <p>"Kick-starting this industry in Australia will take guts and expertise, and the CEFC brings both."</p>
      <p>The CEFC was established under the Gillard government in 2012 to spur investment in clean energy while it introduced a carbon pricing scheme. The organisation has deployed more than $5 billion into clean energy initiatives, mostly through loans for green energy projects. It also has access to $200 million in growth capital for direct investments into clean energy start-ups.</p>
      <p><i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> and <i>The Age</i> <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52ijd.html">revealed earlier this year that private investors were circling</a> the CEFC amid hopes the government might look to privatise the organisation. The UK government sold its "green bank" to Australia's Macquarie Group for £2.3 billion in 2017.</p>
      <p>CEFC CEO Ian Learmonth said in a statement: “The agricultural sector poses a demanding climate change challenge: how to produce more food, more efficiently, for a growing population amid a more extreme climate, while also reducing greenhouse gas intensity and emissions."</p>

      <p>Mr Cannon-Brookes, an outspoken advocate for action on climate change, has repeatedly clashed with the Morrison government over energy policy. Grok is also a major investor in climate-themed startups including Brighte, a solar financing company, and HST Solar, a software platform for the design and engineering of solar projects.</p>
      <p>Mr Cannon-Brookes has also said he would back a $20 billion project to build the world's biggest solar farm in the Northern Territory.</p>
      <p>“There's no doubt that new ideas in agriculture will play a massive role in reducing carbon emissions, while also delivering return on investment. The economic upside for Australia’s<br/>economy is also huge," Mr Cannon-Brookes said in the statement.</p>
      <p>“Sarah and Matt have a solid track record of finding those new ideas, and then making them<br/>work. I can't wait to see the innovation in food tech and agriculture that they deliver.”</p>
