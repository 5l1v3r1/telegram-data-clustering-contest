      <p>OGB signee Fameye has responded to his colleague Awal Mohammed after he called him out on social media for failing to show up for a video shoot.</p>
      <p>According to Awal, he has recorded a song with Fameye and they both agreed on shooting a video for the song to push the song which is titled ‘Akuapem Poloo’.</p>
      <p>He said at the initial stage Fameye and his management demanded an amount of Ghc 2000 before he would feature in the video but he(Awal) spoke with him and the ‘Nothing I get’ hitmaker asked him to send him something.</p>
      <p>He through his manager sent Fameye an amount of Ghc 400 a day before the video shoot as transportation but Fameye called back and spoke rudely to him asking why he would send a big brand like him that amount.</p>
      <p>Awal added that he had to top up with 100Ghc but on the day of the video shoot Fameye and his team failed to show up and they never communicated anything to him that was why he waited for five days before calling on Zylofon’s Sammy Flex to help settle the issue.</p>
      <p>In a new development, Fameye who is currently out of Ghana he told radio presenter Sammy Flex that he is no more willing to be part of the song and would, therefore, pay back the Ghc 500 so Awal can take his voice off the song.</p>
      <p>But Awal after hearing what Fameye has to say also told him he was not to accept the money but would only do that is Fameye is willing to pay for the damages he has cost to him Awal and his management team.</p>
