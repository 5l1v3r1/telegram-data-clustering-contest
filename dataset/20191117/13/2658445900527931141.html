      <p>As against reports that the Lagos State government has approved N35,000 as minimum wage with implementation commencing from November, the government has said it is still negotiating with labour unions.</p>
      <p>The Permanent Secretary, Office of Establishments and Training, Mr. Biodun Bamgboye, who disclosed this yesterday,  said negotiations are still on-going.</p>
      <p>He said, “We are in the process of minimum wage negotiations with labour and we are looking at the best modalities to implement it.”</p>
      <p>The permanent secretary said any agreement reached with the labour unions will be made public through government-recognised communication channels.</p>
      <p>He assured public servants in the state that the outcome of the minimum wage negotiation will represent their best interest.</p>
      <p>Bamgboye reiterated that the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration is committed to enhancing the welfare of staff.</p>
      <p>“Being a people-oriented government, we are committed to ensuring better service delivery through a competent and motivated workforce,” Bamgboye said.</p>
