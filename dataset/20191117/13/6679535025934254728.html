      <p>A father-son duo, belonging to Karnamamidi rehabilitation colony in Mancherial district, on Sunday attempted to consume pesticide in front of Hajipur police station alleging harassment by police.</p>
      <p>The duo, Kotte Veeraiah and Santhosh, took the poison but spit it out soon enough.</p>
      <p>Two others who tried to prevent them from drinking the pesticide were also admitted to hospital along with the latter as the poison was spit on them. Veeraiah alleged that he was booked in a case for complaining against a panchayat secretary for not taking action in a case related to pollution of his field.</p>
      <p>Mancherial DCP Uday Kumar Reddy, however, said Veeraiah was involved in three cases earlier and police was in the process of opening a rowdy sheet against him. He staged the suicide bid only to escape being declared a history sheeter and that Hajipur police station had summoned him only for some details, added Mr. Reddy.</p>
