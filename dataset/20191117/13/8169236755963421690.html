      <h1>Chelsea starlet set to start for England vs Kosovo as Southgate makes changes</h1>

        <b>Following the thumping victory over Montenegro which sealed qualification for Euro 2020, Gareth Southgate has a bit of freedom to experiment against Kosovo later today to see what some of his fringe players have to offer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In theory it would be the last ‘competitive’ game for England before the tournament. Neither team has anything to play for but you can be pretty sure a victory would mean everything to Kosovo.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12016/11863281/callum-hudson-odoi-and-nick-pope-to-start-for-england-against-kosovo">Sky Sports</a> have reported that Southgate is expected to make some changes. They’ve stated that Nick Pope will make is first start in the game while Chelsea’s Callum Hudson-Odoi will make just his second start for England.</p>

      <p>They go on to suggest that there could be further changes, with John Stones expected to be rested, while James Maddison has a slight calf injury that he’s dealing with.</p>
      <p>It could be a huge opportunity for Hudson-Odoi to force his way into the manager’s plans for next summer’s tournament. It’s reasonable to expect he will play a lot for Chelsea if he stays fit for the rest of the season, so a good performance here could give him an outside shot of a starting spot next summer.</p>

      <p>Although Chelsea fans’ priority will be how the youngster plays for his club, there’s also sure to be a sense of pride in seeing one of their homegrown talents making an impact at international level too.</p>
      <p>A lot, however, may depend on Raheem Sterling’s situation. Southgate’s strongest front three right now looks like Sterling, Marcus Rashford and Harry Kane, so anyone else will likely need injuries or a loss of form from one of those to find a way into the team.</p>
      <p>As for Nick Pope, it’s unlikely that he would establish himself as the number one, but Jordan Pickford hasn’t looked particularly convincing in recent times, so it could be a big chance for him too.</p>
