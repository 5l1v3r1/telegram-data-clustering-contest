      <h1>China targets one of region’s most notorious drug cartels</h1>

      <p>Chinese drug officials are working with Mekong countries to strike at the heart of a massive meth syndicate, a senior Beijing drugs tsar said, as the region targets top-level drug traffickers instead of street dealers.</p>
      <p>The porous lawless border areas of Myanmar, Thailand and Laos have for decades been a hub for heroin production, but the so-called “Golden Triangle” drug trade is now pumping unprecedented quantities of synthetic drugs into the global markets – fuelling a $61 billion drug trade.</p>
      <p>In large part responsible for the dramatic shift to synthetic drugs is a mega-cartel known as “Sam Gor”, which the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) believes is Asia’s biggest crime syndicate, led by a Chinese-born Canadian citizen named Tse Chi Lop.</p>
      <p>China is now stepping up efforts with Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to take down Sam Gor in a “joint operation”, said an official from China’s National Narcotics Control Commission.</p>
      <p>“They are one of the major threats. The region as a whole, China included, will do our best to hit it where it hurts the most,” said deputy commissioner Andy Tsang on the sidelines of a Friday meeting to stamp out a regional plan.</p>
      <p>The production of methamphetamine – either in tablet “yaba” form or the highly potent crystallised “ice” version – ketamine and fentanyl take place primarily in Myanmar’s eastern Shan state, but much of the precursor chemicals needed to cook them flow across the border from China.</p>
      <p>Law enforcement has long focused on busting low-level dealers and users on the streets, a plan that has proved “static” when faced with the shifting trafficking routes used by Sam Gor, said Jeremy Douglas, UNODC’s regional representative for Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>Now drug police from the six countries will share intelligence to target traffickers working at border “choke points” where the flow of drugs and precursor chemicals are rampant, he said.</p>
      <p>“You can’t engineer the surge of methamphetamine without the surge of chemicals,” Douglas said, adding that besides China, the chemicals also come from Thailand, Vietnam and India.</p>
      <p>Sam Gor is also believed to launder its billions in drug money out through businesses springing up along the Mekong – including casinos, hotels and real estate.</p>
      <p>Thailand in 2018 netted more than 515 million yaba tablets, 17 times the amount for the entire Mekong region a decade ago – and seizures this year have already outpaced that amount, said the UNODC.</p>
      <p>Drug hauls feature in near daily headlines in the region, with police finding pills packed in Chinese tea sachets – though traffickers are finding more creative ways to ship out the illicit products.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, narcotics police raided a Bangkok warehouse and found 36kg of ice hidden in the metal frames of treadmills which were about to be shipped to Japan, while another 122kg were stored in cardboard boxes.</p>
