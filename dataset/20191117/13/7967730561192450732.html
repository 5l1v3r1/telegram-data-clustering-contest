      <p>A decision on the future of the Sydney Children’s Hospital Network has been delayed four months after an independent review called for urgent action amid protracted conflict over the state's paediatric heart surgeries.</p>
      <p>In July, Health Minister Brad Hazzard held a roundtable of doctors and other healthcare workers from across the state after reviewers said governance issues and tensions between the Randwick and Westmead hospitals needed to be settled <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p523rt.html">"as a matter of urgency".</a></p>
      <p>A resolution – including whether cardiac services will be concentrated at the one Westmead site – was expected to be finalised within weeks.</p>

      <p>But the NSW Health ministry is holding off on until it receives a statewide review of all paediatrics services conducted by academic Emeritus Professor Richard Henry.</p>
      <p>Opposition health spokesman Ryan Park said the government was avoiding the issue.</p>
      <p>"It’s simply disgraceful that nearly four months have passed and the government has done nothing to fix this situation," he said.</p>
      <p>“We have had an external report, a talkfest but still no decision and it's quite obvious that the government have thrown their hands up and said they can’t fix this crisis.”</p>
      <p>A NSW Health spokesman said Professor Henry’s review will make recommendations on the governance and planning of healthcare services for children for the next five years.</p>
      <p>“These recommendations will obviously relate to considerations of the governance of the Children’s Hospitals Network and the configuration of paediatric cardiac surgery at the Sydney Children’s Hospital, Randwick and Children’s Hospital at Westmead,” the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>Professor Henry’s report is due by the end of 2019 and an announcement on all the related issues will be made after that, the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>Westmead cardiologists believe patients will have better outcomes if cardiac services are focused at one hospital, while doctors from Randwick believe losing cardiac surgery would compromise other services.</p>

      <p>"Our message has always been very clear, we believe that cardiac surgery is a vital component of any children’s tertiary referral hospital," Chair of the Sydney Children’s Hospital Randwick medical staff council Dr Susan Russell said <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52bdi.html">after July's roundtable</a>.</p>
      <p>Most clinicians at that roundtable – including paediatric healthcare workers from rural and regional NSW – agreed the state would be best served with one major children’s hospital providing cardiac surgery services. But medical staff from the Randwick hospital disagreed.</p>
      <p>In May, 130 of Randwick's senior doctors voted in a secret ballot to leave the network. Dr Michael Brydon, the head of the network, <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p51wz5.html">quit in June</a>, and Gary Sholler – who was the network's director of paediatric cardiac services – <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p50wia.html">resigned in January</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr Park said he believed cardiac surgery needed to be an option at both children's hospitals.</p>
      <p>“That’s what parents have told me and that is what I feel needs to happen," he said.</p>
