      <h1>NFL Week 11 Weather Updates: Cold, rain, wind (and elevation) could impact fantasy start 'em, sit 'em calls</h1>

      <p>The temperatures are starting to drop a bit as we hit Week 11, but there aren't any sub-freezing games on the schedule. A handful of games in the mid-Atlantic are in the "worth watching, but not worth worrying about" zone, as they could see colder temperatures and rainy/windy conditions. Perhaps the game impacted by the "elements" will be the Chiefs-Chargers Monday night matchup in Mexico City, which could impact fantasy start 'em, sit 'em decisions for at least one position.</p>

      <h3>NFL Week 11 weather updates</h3>
      <p><b>Mid-Atlantic games (Jets @ Redskins, Texans @ Ravens, Patriots @ Eagles).</b> These threegames are all ending up with pretty much the same weather forecast. It will becold (around 40 degrees), but not cold enough to be an issue. It will bea little breezy (10-15-mph sustained winds), but not windy enough to impact passing. There's a chance for rain, but not a high enough chance or heavy enough rain to impact play. I'll keep a watch on all of these games and update as necessary, especially if it looks like rain may be a bigger issue than it appears now, but for the time being I wouldn't fade any players due to weather.</p>

      <p><b>Chiefs vs. Chargers (in Mexico City).</b>My favorite game of the week comes on Monday night in Mexico. The "weather" likely won't be overly impactful -- light winds, a chance for showers and storms -- but the elevation will be. This game is being played at an elevation of 7,200 feet, which is 2,000 feet higher than Denver. High elevation means a few things. First it means a bump to kickers. The NFL record-long FG is 64 yards (in Denver), there's also been four 63-yard field goals (two in Denver). That elevation matters for distance, and with the elevation of Mexico City, we might see teams line up for a FG in the 65-70-yard range. Obviously, the game situation would have to bring us there, but the point is that kickers will be given every opportunity to bang through some 50-plusyarders. The second important note is that high elevation can impact your ability to get your "wind" or breath. It's generally the defensive side of the ball that wears down first, and I expect the elevation to exacerbate that issue in this game. I love the offense in general here -- passing, running, and kicking. All the conditions are lined up to help.</p>
