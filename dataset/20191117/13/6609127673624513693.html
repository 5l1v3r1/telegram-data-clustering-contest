      <p>Back home, Dan appeared to be making the most of his free time as he let loose at the Float Like A Butterfly Ball in aid of the Caudwell Charity.</p>
      <p>Pictures show him chatting to the Real Housewives of Cheshire star who is married to Paddy McGuinness.</p>
      <p>The dad-of-three looked to be entertaining the blonde beauty, who laughed as they got to know each other at The Grosvenor House Hotel.</p>
      <p>This morning Dan wrote on Instagram: "Had a great night at the float like a butterfly ball last night @caudwellchildren incredible to see what this charity does for so many children."</p>

      <p>Dan's hopes that a six-week break from Jacqueline in the jungle will help them reconnect.</p>
      <p>The pair have been rocked by cheating accusations since marrying in June 2017, but are hoping that the space will bring them closer together.</p>
      <p>Friends think her stint on the ITV hit show could help them reconnect– just like when Dan went into Celebrity Big Brother.</p>
      <p>Today The Sun on Sunday revealed feisty Jacqueline messaged Love Island beauty Gabby Allen demanding to know: “Did you sleep with my husband?”</p>
      <p>Gabby reassured the mum of two nothing had happened between her and the former Towie star, but Dan and Jacqueline briefly split up because of the rumours.</p>

      <p>She took him back months later, but Dan has today rubbished claims the jungle-bound star is a “doormat” and insists they're now stronger than ever.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline, who played Lauren Branning in the BBC1 soap, is understood to have also messaged other supposed love rivals.</p>
      <p>Dan revealed: “Jacqueline has sent a few messages to women I’ve been accused of cheating with — I think any partner would do that — asking what had happened between us.</p>
      <p>“I’ve told her I haven’t cheated on her, that I’ve just been out with those girls, they’re mates and that’s it.</p>
      <p>“I’m a friendly person so I’ll go out and speak to people I get on with, male or female. That’s just what I’m like.</p>

      <p>“But I get pictured with a woman and suddenly we’re getting cosy.</p>
      <p>"With Gabby, I know the pictures didn’t look great because of the angle they were taken at, but there was nothing in it.</p>
      <p>“And if Jacqueline really believed I had cheated on her, she wouldn’t be with me now because she wouldn’t stand for any crap, honestly.</p>
      <p>"She’s no doormat. She’s a very strong woman.</p>

      <p>“If anyone starts on her in the jungle, good luck! Trust me, I wouldn’t want to be them. She is very forward and will absolutely stand up for herself.</p>
      <p>“I can’t wait for people to see the real her, because before now she’s always been either ‘Lauren from EastEnders’ or ‘the actress having marriage problems’.”</p>
      <p>Dan and Jacqueline, who have daughters Ella, four, and Mia, one, married in 2017 after three years together.</p>
      <p>He told The Sun Online at the ball last night he was "missing" his wife already.</p>
