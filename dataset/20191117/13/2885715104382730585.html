      <p>The <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jawaharlal-nehru-university-jnu/">Jawaharlal Nehru University</a> (JNU) will conduct the monsoon end semester examinations from December 12. The varsity has decided to conduct the examinations as scheduled from December 12 to 20, 2019, amid ongoing protest against the fee hike.</p>
      <p>“Due to the ongoing strike by a group of students, thousands of students who wish to participate in the JNU academic programmes and plan to complete their academic requirements for continuance in the University, are adversely affected,” the varsity notice mentioned.</p>
      <p>“Since the academic calender has been approved by the Academic Council and the Executive Council, there is going to be no relaxation in the above deadlines,” the notice read.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/education/jnu-hostel-fee-hike-partial-rollback-protest-6117913/">ongoing protest in JNU</a> has forced the administration to partially roll back the hike in hostel fees. As per the revised decision, the room rent for single occupancy will be Rs 200 while for double, it will be Rs 100. The caution deposit will be Rs 5,500. The service charges will continue to be fined at Rs 1,700. The varsity will also provide assistance for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) students.</p>
