      <h2>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab claimed reports from a National Security Committee meeting that the Home Secretary had objected to British children being brought home</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:28:23+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:28</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has denied claims Home Secretary Priti Patel blocked the rescue of British orphans and unaccompanied minors from Syria.</p>
      <p>It was reported that during a National Security Committee meeting last month, Ms Patel objected to British children being brought home over "security concerns".</p>
      <p>The plan, which was being considered for late October, was reportedly abandoned as a result of objections led by Ms Patel alongside Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Chancellor <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sajid-javid-mp">Sajid Javid</a> .</p>
      <p>Asked about the reports by the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Raab said: "That's not quite right, is it? You're relying on a leaked report from an NSC meeting."</p>

      <p>He added: "The Government speaks with one voice, and we've made it very clear that when you've got orphaned children or unaccompanied minors and there's no security threat, then of course we will seek to repatriate them to this country.</p>
      <p>"But there are huge challenges in operating on the ground in Syria and elsewhere."</p>
      <p>Asked if the government will try to bring unaccompanied minors back to the UK, he said: "Absolutely."</p>

      <p>Mr Raab was, according to the Guardian, among figures in the meeting advocating strongly for the repatriation of the children.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Security minister Brandon Lewis was asked about the reports on Sky News and said he would be "cautious" in answering.</p>
      <p>But he said: "But I do not recognise a situation where I am aware at any point the Home Secretary blocking any kind of rescue mission."</p>
