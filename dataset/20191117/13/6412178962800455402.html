        <b>Real Madrid are preparing another raid on Chelsea after signing Eden Hazard this summer, according to reports in Spain.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/hazard-reveals-emotion-of-signing-for-real-madrid-at-unveiling"><b>A long-running transfer saga finally came to an end when Madrid signed Hazard for a potential club record fee in June</b></a>, but he has only managed one goal from seven La Liga appearances so far.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://eldesmarque.com/madrid/real-madrid/noticias/176065-cuatro-fichajes-tapados-de-florentino-perez-lee-lo-nombres-revolucion-en-el-real-madrid"><i>El Desmarque</i></a>, Madrid are considering adding more firepower to their attack with a bid for another Chelsea winger, Callum Hudson-Odoi.</p>
      <p>The English teenager has been one of the players tasked with stepping into Hazard’s shoes this season, so far delivering four assists and one goal from 11 appearances in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane and owner Florentino Perez are reportedly keeping an eye on Hudson-Odoi’s progress this season, as part of a four-man shortlist to revolutionise their attack next year.</p>
      <p>RB Salzburg starlet Erling Braut Haaland is named as the main target, while they are also said to be tracking Villarreal winger Samu Chukwueze and <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/father-of-everton-star-claims-summer-move-was-a-mistake"><b>struggling Everton signing Moise Kean</b></a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/hudson-odoi-sees-salary-go-up-400-as-teenager-signs-new-chelsea-deal"><b>Hudson-Odoi only signed a contract extension at Stamford Bridge in September</b></a>, quadrupling his salary as a result, after the Blues managed to fend off long-term interest from Bayern Munich.</p>
