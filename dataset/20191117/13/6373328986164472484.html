        <b>UFC veteran Ross Pearson’s return to the cage did not go to plan after finding himself on the end of an insane rolling thunder head kick by Davy Gallon.</b>

      <p>The former TUF winner, ‘The Real Deal’, retired from MMA earlier this year following a brutal knockout loss to Desmond Green.</p>
      <p>Following a boxing win in May, the Brit returned to the cage last night, November 16, at MTK MMA: Probellum in London. Alas, victory wasn’t on the cards.</p>

      <p>Pearson and Gallon exchanged blows for the welterweight headliner event, but it was the Frenchman who came out on top.</p>
      <p>In the third round, Pearson is sent flying across the cage by a near-flawless rolling thunder kick – one of the most difficult moves to pull off in mixed martial arts.</p>

      <p>Naturally, many MMA fans’ jaws dropped online after seeing the sensational move in real time. One viewer called it: ‘One of the greatest knock outs of all time!’</p>

      <p>Another wrote: ‘KO of the year via rolling thunder. So good it makes the commentator swear.’</p>

      <p>One fan wrote: ‘But take a bow Davy Gallon. That’s the KO of the year for sure. Don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone pull off a rolling thunder kick before and KO someone with it.’</p>
      <p>Another viewer added: ‘Christ on a bike what a KO… this is literally in the final minute of the final round! Flying Rolling Thunder KO.’</p>
      <p>Following the fight, Gallon’s pro record stands at 18-7-2, while Pearson fell to 20-17 (1 NC) after suffering his third consecutive loss. He has yet to comment on whether he’ll retire again.</p>
