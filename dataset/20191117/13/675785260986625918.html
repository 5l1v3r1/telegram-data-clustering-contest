      <p>A woman has revealed how she struggles to control her anger and says her life is dictated by violent mood swings.</p>
      <p>Sophie Hackett, from Plymouth, recently turned 28 but didn't hit the town with her friends to celebrate her birthday.</p>
      <p>Instead she stayed in with her 'support network' - partner Matthew Chandler and her friend who lives just down the road, reports <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/plymouth-woman-who-cant-control-3539084">PlymouthLive</a> .</p>
      <p>Their evening was ‘chilled’ and ‘lovely’ but this isn’t always the case in their flat because on top of taking medication for epilepsy, Sophie struggles to control her anger.</p>
      <p>She is speaking about her experiences because she feels there isn’t enough support for people struggling with anger management issues.</p>
      <p>Sophie recounted one recent incident that illustrates her occasional lack of control.</p>

      <p>“I was using the internet through his (Matthew’s) phone and he went away because he was expecting a call," she said.</p>
      <p>“That part of the flat doesn’t like the internet at all.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t hear him leave. My internet went and I exploded to the point that I threw my phone at the door.</p>
      <p>“That was the most recent one and made me realise I need some help. But I didn’t know how to get the help.</p>
      <p>“I referred myself to Plymouth Options for help with my anger and mental health. They did a telephone assessment at 8am.</p>
      <p>“We got to the end and they told me there is absolutely no anger management support in Plymouth.”</p>
      <p>She explained: “I lost my uncle two years ago. It was a traumatic death. He lived in Birmingham, so I had to find out over the phone.</p>
      <p>“I started having flashbacks of the phone call and the situation leading up to the funeral. He was more like an older brother. Even if it was five seconds on his work break he’d ask if I’m alright.</p>
      <p>“He loved the sea. He bought a little boat that he named after my nan and he was doing it up. He was meant to move to this end of the country with his fiancée.</p>

      <p>“He died before they could get married and before they could move down. I think part of the anger is that he didn’t get to experience it down here.</p>
      <p>“I spoke with Mind and after telling them about my uncle they thought I had complex grief. Which is basically if you’ve been grieving for longer than three months or if it’s a particularly traumatic experience.”</p>
      <p>She then spoke about day-to-day life.</p>
      <p>"You’ve gone back to the office and you’ve lost your pen, and you’re like ‘for God’s sake’ but for me I can’t stop it," she said. "It affects every area of my life.</p>
      <p>“I don’t fully know I’m doing it until it’s over. Some people can feel themselves getting angry and can take five minutes or have a glass of water.</p>
      <p>“Once the bomb starts ticking, I can’t turn it off. It goes from nothing to 100, everyone move away.</p>
      <p>“I will avoid talking to someone because they’ve said something some people might take as a joke but I’ve taken it the wrong way.</p>
      <p>“Nine times out of ten I do not leave this flat without somebody with me. If he goes out I do not leave the flat. The furthest I’ll go on my own is up to my friend’s which is two minutes away.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“If the dog desperately needs to go out and he’s not home yet, I’ve been known to call him just someone is on the end of the phone.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to be angry. I don’t like the angry person I’ve become. It’s not how I was brought up. I just want to change it but how can I change it if there’s no support.</p>
      <p>“I can sit in front of my laptop and look up anger management coping tips. Who can’t do that? But how do I put them into place?</p>
      <p>“It’s frustrating because I never expected to be in the amount of trouble I was in. How many other people have been in the same situation as me because they got angry?”</p>
      <p>She couldn’t go too much into the ‘trouble’ she mentioned, but it was regarding a neighbour who would play music until the early hours in the morning.</p>
      <p>Sophie’s attempts to deal with this neighbour did not go well. She said: “I’d knock on her door, no answer. I put a polite note under the door saying ‘it’s a bit silly at this time of the morning. Can you at least turn it down a bit?’</p>
      <p>“That resulted in her marching up the stairs, standing in front of my door and screaming threats. She started again one night and I retaliated. I got sick to death of the bullying. It wasn’t just me. In my opinion she thought she ran the street.</p>
      <p>“It resulted in a lot of trouble.”</p>
      <p>She then repeated: “I just don’t like the person I am. I don’t know how to change without support to change.”</p>
      <p>We then spoke about how Sophie copes. She said: “The only way I can cope at the minute is to push it down. I don’t want to explode in public. Let’s use Tesco as an example. I’ll go there and maybe fall over because somebody bumped into me.</p>
      <p>“I’ll get angry because I’ll be embarrassed. I then have to push that deep down so I don’t explode in the shop, but then I’ll get back here and it’s ten times worse.</p>
      <p>“There are two responses. Either I’ll sit in the corner and cry or I’ll fully explode. Sometimes I’ll cause arguments for no reason to get the anger out. It’ll usually be him on the end of it unfortunately.</p>

      <p>“I can see it from the other side, I can see where it’s pushing people out. How much more can they put up with before they give up on me? I can't blame them, because it’s not nice.”</p>
      <p>Matthew Chandler, 28, has been in a relationship with Sophie for nearly nine years. They moved to Plymouth to look after Matthew’s mother who was suffering with lung disease. They decided to stay after she passed.</p>
      <p>Matthew said: “It’s frustrating that there’s no other support and it’s heart-breaking that she struggles so much.</p>
      <p>“All you want to do is support your loved ones and it’s upsetting when you can’t do that.”</p>
      <p>Sophie gave an example of Matthew’s support.</p>
      <p>“A phone isn’t the only thing I’ve broken in the past," she said. “As awful as it sounds, if there’s something in my hands it usually gets lobbed across the room. That’s my go-to.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had my laptop on my lap, or my phone in my hand, and I’ve had to say ‘take that off me.’</p>
      <p>“I shouldn’t have to do that. I’m 28 years old. I should be able to go ‘yeah, Ok, I’m p**sed off.’</p>
      <p>“My head’s telling me calm down but I physically can’t stop myself.”</p>
      <p>On what she would like to see available to people, Sophie said: “Some kind of anger management support or counselling. I’m going for courses at the minute about self-esteem but there’s nothing for anger.</p>
      <p>“It would be good to go to a session twice a week, and as you deal with it better you go once a week, then once a fortnight.</p>
      <p>“You don’t want to end up depending on the counsellor, but you’ve got someone sat there giving you an angry situation and a result.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to get to the point where it destroys my life and I don’t want it to do that. I can’t see myself coping with it in the long run. It scares me how angry I get. It’s not nice to say about yourself.</p>
      <p>“I felt stupid after speaking to Plymouth Options because I’d accepted myself to the point where I could admit what I was and there’s no help.”</p>
