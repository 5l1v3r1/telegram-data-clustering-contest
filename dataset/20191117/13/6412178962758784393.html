        <b>Arsenal will offer Granit Xhaka a return to Borussia Monchengladbach, should the German side promise them first refusal on Denis Zakaria in return, according to reports.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Xhaka is expected to leave Arsenal at the first opportunity in January after a public fallout <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/ruthless-emery-strips-granit-xhaka-of-arsenal-captaincy"><b>which saw him lose the captaincy after reacting to fan criticism</b></a>.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-offer-granit-xhaka-borussia-20896461"><i>Mirror</i></a>, one potential solution for him would be to return to former club Monchengladbach, from whom Arsenal signed him in 2016.</p>
      <p>It is claimed that Arsenal are interested in current Borussia midfielder Denis Zakaria, and they hope that sending Xhaka back to the Bundesliga club would pave the way for a future deal.</p>
      <p>In fact, the move hinges on Borussia’s willingness to give Arsenal the first option on Zakaria. <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/newcastle-ready-to-propose-package-to-rescue-furious-granit-xhaka"><b>Newcastle are said to be weighing up a move for Xhaka</b></a> if the German side do not agree, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/granit-xhakas-mind-made-up-as-january-favourites-emerge"><b>while AC Milan have been suggested as the favourites for his signature</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Zakaria himself has a whole host of potential suitors, with Manchester United and Liverpool also linked – <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/report-clarifies-klopps-stance-as-dynamic-duo-linked-with-liverpool-move"><b>although recent claims suggested Jurgen Klopp was in fact not interested in the 22-year-old</b></a>.</p>
