      <h1>NCT Buses director reveals the secret to keeping passengers happy - and why bus travel keeps growing in Nottingham</h1>
      <h2>'It’s about making bus travel as attractive as we can to help Nottingham keep moving'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:54:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:54</time> by <a rel="author">Laura Hammond</a></address>
      <p>With a history dating back to 1878, Nottingham City Transport (NCT) has grown to become a multi-million-pound company.</p>
      <p>It carries one million passengers every week and claims to have the most satisfied bus users in the country.</p>
      <p>And now <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nct-buses">NCT</a> is preparing to transform bus travel in the city by introducing contactless ticketing.</p>
      <p>The project has been several years in the making but David Astill, commercial and operations director at NCT, said it is about to come into fruition.</p>
      <p>He explained: "We are very keen at the end of this year – or early 2020 – to move to contactless ticketing. That will be tap and go ticketing where the bank card replaces the smart card.</p>
      <p>"We will also offer the cheapest fare available for the journeys that have been made.</p>
      <p>"Not only will it offer the convenience of the contactless ticketing, it will also offer the best price."</p>
      <p>The project – described as "very, very exciting" for both NCT staff and passengers alike – follows a busy period for the company.</p>
      <p>NCT invested "huge sums of money" in a further 67 Bio-Gases – "super environmentally friendly buses" which reduce CO2 emissions by 84 per cent - bringing the total to 120.</p>
      <p>Mr Astill said the move makes NCT the biggest operator of Bio-Gas buses in the world.</p>
      <p>The company, which reported a turnover of £52.96m for 2018/19, has also invested in upgrading the remaining 200 buses which are powered by diesel.</p>
      <p>Mr Astill said: "By the end of this year, the entire fleet of NCT buses will either be Bio-Gas or diesel, meeting the very strict Euro 6 emission standards.</p>
      <p>"It means we are as green as we possibly can [be] for now."</p>

      <p>The company has seen almost 10 years of continuous passenger growth, despite bus travel declining by 2.5 per cent nationally in the last year, according to Mr Astill.</p>
      <p>He credits a range of factors – including a well-trained workforce, Wi-Fi access on all buses and audio and visual ‘next stop’ announcements – for the continued use of buses to travel around <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-city-centre">Nottingham</a>.</p>
      <p>He said: "A third of our customers tell us that the journey that they make with NCT, they could make by car but they choose to make it by bus instead because we are more convenient than driving.</p>
      <p>"We are more cost effective than car parking charges, and certainly for journeys into Nottingham, it’s more convenient and a better experience to travel by bus."</p>
      <p>The company has spent more than £1m on real time technology, allowing it to provide live updates to customers.</p>
      <p>Mr Astill said: "It also means we can see where the buses are and we’re in constant communication with our drivers.</p>
      <p>"Our challenge is to do that on a daily basis to deliver as high a service as we can."</p>
      <p>NCT benefits from 26km of bus lane and has traffic light priority at key junctions, meaning bus speeds in Nottingham "are better than average".</p>
      <p>However, congestion of the roads poses a major challenge to NCT and hinders the company’s ability to reach its target of operating 95 per cent of journeys on time.</p>
      <p>Mr Astill said: "We are sharing the highway with other road users. We do benefit from 26km of bus lane. Even so, when something goes wrong on the highway it’s out of our control.</p>
      <p>"It’s about making bus travel as attractive as we can to help Nottingham keep moving.</p>
      <p>"We always want to be as reliable as we can. We can never get complacent about our standard of reliability. There’s always room for improvement."</p>
      <p>And it seems the company’s efforts are paying off as 94 per cent of those who completed a recent customer satisfaction survey reported being "satisfied or very satisfied" with the service provided by NCT.</p>
      <p>Looking to the future, Mr Astill is clear about what the company, which employs 1,100 people, should be doing.</p>
      <p>He said: "We see NCT remaining at the forefront of public transport provision and working tirelessly to make public transport an attractive alternative to travelling by car because that has to be the key target – to keep Nottingham moving is our key aspiration."</p>
      <p>
        <i>NCT was ranked 76th in this year's <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/live-updates-nottinghamshires-top-200-3475742">Top 200</a>, which ranks businesses by turnover.</i>
