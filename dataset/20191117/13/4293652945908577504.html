      <h1>Report: Astros executive sent email to suggest sign stealing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:04:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/author/sportsnet-staff/" target="_blank">Sportsnet Staff</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/teams/houston-astros/">Houston Astros</a> executive Kevin Goldstein sent an email suggesting the use of cameras to steal opponents’ signs, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Ken_Rosenthal/status/1195873535681544192?s=20">report</a> from <i>The Athletic</i>‘s Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich, which provides the first indication that the team’s front office was involved in an alleged sign-stealing scandal.</p>
      <p>The Astros have been under fire in recent days for allegations that they used outfield cameras in 2017 to steal signs of opposing pitchers, then communicated those signs by banging on trash cans from the dugout.</p>
      <p>Pitcher <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/players/mike-fiers/502128">Mike Fiers</a>, who played for the Astros in 2017, went <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAthleticMLB/status/1194351659284975616?s=20">on record</a> with <i>The Athletic</i> to confirm the sign stealing.</p>

      <p>Initial reports were unclear about how high up the chain this behaviour went, but the latest news about Goldstein suggests this activity was known on a broad scale.</p>
      <p>Here’s what Goldstein’s email said, as <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28098216/astros-exec-suggested-using-cameras-spy-17-sources-say">reported</a> by <i>ESPN</i>‘s Jeff Passan:</p>
      <p>“One thing in specific we are looking for is picking up signs coming out of the dugout. What we are looking for is how much we can see, how we would log things, if we need cameras/binoculars, etc. So go to game, see what you can (or can’t) do and report back your findings.”</p>
      <p>Major League Baseball has an ongoing investigation into this matter as it interviews players and others who may have been involved. There is no precedent for punishment in the case of stealing signs, though MLB has revoked draft picks and dealt fines to teams in the past as a way of levying sanctions.</p>
      <p>An added layer to this situation is that three members from that 2017 Astros team — which won the World Series — are now in managerial roles: manager A.J. Hinch (still with the Astros), bench coach Alex Cora (Boston Red Sox) and designated hitter Carlos Beltran (New York Mets).</p>
      <p>There is no timetable for when MLB will conclude its investigation and decide on consequences.</p>
