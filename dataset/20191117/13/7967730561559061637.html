      <h1>Storm in an N cup: larger breast sizes create retail growth</h1>

      <p>The smallest size bra Maxine Windram sells at Brava Lingerie is a D cup and sales have never been stronger.</p>
      <p>Windram started Brava with her mother back in the days when a DD cup was the largest size available in stores.</p>

      <p>"You were seen as big if you didn't fit into those sizes; it made women feel negative about their bodies," she says.</p>
      <p>Brava now sells up to a KK cup size while competitor Big Girls Don't Cry Anymore offers up to an N cup.</p>
      <h3>Fitting by eye</h3>
      <p>Brava first opened its doors in 2006 with one store in the Melbourne suburb of Prahran.</p>
      <blockquote>As a retailer, if we are not keeping up with changing body shapes, we will be left behind.<cite>Maxine Windram</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Windram says she was "quite naive" and didn't know anything about bra-fitting but quickly worked out using tape measures didn't work with a fuller bust because breasts are all about volume.</p>
      <p>"We realised we needed to take a more holistic approach and threw the tape measures away," she says.</p>
      <p>Brava's fitters now "fit by eye", which Windram says comes with experience and "feels gentler than wrapping a tape measure around".</p>
      <p>Online shoppers use Brava's virtual fitter to create a profile, including their likes, dislikes and "challenges" with bra-fitting in the past alongside a photo of themselves in a bra.</p>

      <p>The business has grown to six stores across Victoria and New South Wales with a turnover of around $7 million.</p>
      <p>Windram says Brava's sales continue to increase due to its adoption of technology and the growing breast size of Australian women.</p>
      <p>"If we are getting bigger as a society, our breasts are going to increase along with that," she says. "As a retailer, if we are not keeping up with changing body shapes, we will be left behind."</p>
      <p>Brava adopts a mantra of body positivity that stems from Windram's own experiences buying bras.</p>
      <p>"As a teenager, when bras wouldn't fit I felt I didn't fit," she says. "We want women to have a positive bra-fitting experience so we have always tried to use customer photography instead of supplier images and we are very mindful of our language when we speak to customers."</p>
      <h3>Obesity and the environment</h3>
      <p>A spokesperson for bra manufacturer Berlei says 20 years ago B cup was the most common size in Australia but now the most common size is a C cup, which has not changed over the last four years.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson says over the last four years, Berlei has also seen a "small increase" of 2 per cent in cups sizes over a D.</p>

      <p>Professor of Women's Health at Monash University Susan Davis says she is "fairly confident" breast sizes have increased in recent years.</p>
      <p>"The bras are only walking off the shelves because people are buying them," she says.</p>
      <p>Professor Davis says the increase in breast size is likely to be a result of increasing obesity and environmental issues.</p>
      <p>Her research team recently looked at about 7,000 young Australian women between the ages of 18 to 39 and found 22 per cent were overweight and 25 per cent obese.</p>
      <p>Professor Davis also points to exposure to chemicals and compounds called endocrine disruptors such as BPA found in many plastics, which can disrupt hormonal balance.</p>
      <p>"We don't understand what they are doing but it appears they affect reproduction and potentially have an effect on breast growth," she says.</p>
      <h3>Turning to technology</h3>
      <p>In her Brisbane store Big Girls Don't Cry Anymore, Karen Edbrooke has seen firsthand the increase in breast size.</p>
      <p>"The statistics show everyone is getting bigger," she says. "We have had to change our business model over the years to cater for society."</p>

      <p>Edbrooke started the retailer after she had a major car accident and put on 30 kilograms in eight months, which meant she couldn't buy bras in Australia.</p>
      <p>Big Girls Don't Cry Anymore now stocks up to cup size N, with 25 staff serving customers in-store and online.</p>
      <p>The retailer and wholesaler turned over $4 million last year and is on track for $8 million in sales this year.</p>
      <p>"September was our busiest month in 27 years," Edbrooke says, putting the store in sharp contrast to the general <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52nte.html">retail downturn</a>, which has seen Australians buying everyday goods at the slowest rate since the 1990-91 recession.</p>
      <p>Edbrooke says focusing on a niche and growing area, along with adopting technology including targeted advertising on social media and virtual fittings, has boosted the retailer.</p>

      <p>"You can Skype and FaceTime into our fitting rooms and get a fitting," she says. "We also ran Big Girls TV, a live fashion show [that] we streamed on Facebook and Instagram where people could ask questions and stop the models on the runway."</p>
      <p>Edbrooke says these innovations set her store apart from retailers that don't have a website and don't use social media.</p>
      <p>"Traditional retailers are not keeping up to date with technology," she says. "Customers check you out online first."</p>
