      <p>Each time Kareena Kapoor Khan and Aamir Khan have come together on the big screen, they have created magic.

      <p>Interestingly, it’s for the first time that Kareena Kapoor Khan auditioned for a role. Opening up about the same, Bebo said in an interview, “Because knowing the way that he is, I think he wanted to be like 100% sure. So very randomly, out of the blue, I got a call from Aamir. ‘I want you to hear this film, this and that and I am very excited about it.’ So it just happened very organically. I heard the script like just then the minute he called me and he was just like let’s read some scenes. I want you to read some scenes. So I was like yeah, I have never done something like this. I thought like what the hell. I want to see myself if I want to do this or not and you know there is nothing wrong in that,” <br/><br/>We are quite excited about the film, what about you?</p>
