        <b>Plenty of <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/brazilian-grand-prix">Brazilian Grands Prix</a> have had a splash of rain throughout the years, but it doesn't seem as if the 2019 edition will. The forecast suggests a dry race with sunny weather however the temperature is expected to change by around 5c during the race. </b>

      <p>Higher temperatures compared to the rest of the weekend are forecast. This might provide Haas with a headache after one of their best qualifying sessions of the 2019 season. They tend to struggle to get the tyres in the optimum window when the temperatures are high. </p>

      <p>Pirelli, the F1 tyre manufacturers, believe a one-stop soft to hard will be the quickest strategy for the Brazilian Grand Prix. This is as long as the drivers can make the softs last until around lap 28. The second fastest strategy is a one-stop from soft to mediums providing those on the softs can keep the soft tyres working in lap 35. </p>

      <p>The moment the Grand Prix of Brazil starts, the sun is shining and it is about 24 degrees. The chance of rain is zero and there is a strong wind. That all remains the same, apart from the temperature. It drops to twenty degrees between 3:00 PM and 6:00 PM (local time).</p>
