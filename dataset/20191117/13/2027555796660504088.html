      <h1>Congress announces six candidates for Karnataka bypolls</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:51:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The Congress on Saturday released a list of six candidates for the December 5 assembly bypolls in Karnataka.</p>
      <p>The party has fielded Gajanan Balachandra Mangasuli from Athani, Bharamgouda Alagouda Kage from Kagwad and Lakhan Jarkiholi from Gokak.</p>
      <p>It has also given nomination to Venkatrao Ghorpade from Vijayanagara, Rizwan Arshad from Shivajinagar and K B Chandrashekar from Krishnarajpet.</p>

      <p>A party statement said Congress president Sonia Gandhi has approved the names of the candidates.</p>
      <p>The Congress also named Praveen Peter as its candidate for the biennial election to the legislative council of Karnataka.</p>
      <p>Bypolls will be held in 15 constituencies as the sitting Congress-JDS MLAs were disqualified by then Assembly Speaker K R Ramesh Kumar ahead of a trust vote, which led to the fall of the HD Kumaraswamy government and the return of the B S Yediyurappa-led BJP to power in July.</p>
      <p>In total 17 MLAs were disqualified but bypolls will be held in 15 of those seats as by-elections to Maski and RR Nagar constituencies are withheld with separate cases regarding them pending before the high court.</p>
      <p>Sixteen of the 17 disqualified Congress-JD(S) legislators have joined the BJP and 13 of them have been given nomination by the saffron party from their respective seats.</p>
      <p>The BJP will need to win at least six of these 15 seats to remain in power. Of the 15 constituencies, 12 were represented by Congress and three by JD(S).</p>
      <p>The last date for filing of nominations for the bypolls is November 18.</p>
