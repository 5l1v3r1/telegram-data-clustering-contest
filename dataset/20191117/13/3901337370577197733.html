      </p>
      <p>The South Africans got their campaign off to a disappointing start on Thursday evening following a 2-0 loss to Ghana at the Cape Coast Stadium.</p>
      <p>Molefi Ntseki's troops will be desperate for three points against this afternoon's opponents, who thrashed Sao Tome and Principe 4-0 on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Despite Sudan's big win earlier this week, Bafana will still fancy themselves heading into the encounter after winning the last two matches between the two nations.</p>
      <p>Bafana were sweating on the fitness of Bongani Zungu, who limped off in the defeat to Ghana, but the Amiens midfielder does miss out this afternoon.</p>
      <p>The match will be televised on SABC One.</p>
