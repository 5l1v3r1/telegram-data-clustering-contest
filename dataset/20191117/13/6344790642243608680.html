      <p><b><i>Folklords</i></b> #1 is a highly anticipated comic that is set to release on November 13, and it’s already on its 3rd printing before it the release date. With a fast-tracked third printing, BOOM! Studios is releasing another variant cover with art by <b>Peter Bergting</b> that looks pretty awesome. <i>Folklords</i> is written by <b>Matt Kindt</b> with art from <b>Matt Smith</b>.</p>
      <blockquote>In a world of magic and monsters, Ansel is an outsider haunted by visions of well-pressed suits and modern technology. When it comes time for him to declare his Quest on his 18th birthday, Ansel decides to seek out a legend that is only spoken in hushed whispers—the Folklords—hoping they can explain his visions...but looking for the Folklords is expressly forbidden, and going on a rogue quest is punishable by death. What will Ansel risk to find answers to the questions and visions that have set him apart his entire life?</blockquote>
      <p>The third printing of <i>Folklords</i> #1 will be available on December 4.</p>
