      <h1>Joe Gelhardt signs a new contract amid Liverpool and Everton links</h1>
      <h2>Joe Gelhardt scored his first professional goal recently.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:45:18+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>Wigan Athletic striker Joe Gelhardt has signed a new contract, <a href="https://wiganathletic.com/news/2019/november/Joe-Gelhardt-signs-new-Wigan-Athletic-contract/">the club’s official website reports</a>.</p>
      <p>A host of clubs are chasing Gelhardt, including Everton and Liverpool (<a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-join-man-utd-liverpool-20897626">The Daily Star</a>). But the teenager has decided to commit his future to Wigan instead.</p>
      <p>Gelhardt was born in Liverpool and is now being chased by both Merseyside clubs. The 17-year-old is already in the Wigan first-team and he scored his first professional goal recently – against Hull City in September.</p>
      <p>The England U18 starlet is a highly-rated young striker who is a proven goalscorer at youth level. He recently impressed against Liverpool, which could accelerate a move.</p>

      <p>Darren Royle, executive chairman of Wigan, <a href="https://wiganathletic.com/news/2019/november/Joe-Gelhardt-signs-new-Wigan-Athletic-contract/">told the club’s official website</a>: “Joe is an exciting talent who has already shown this season what he can bring to this football club.</p>
      <p>“Joe, his family and his representatives believe that Wigan Athletic is the best place for Joe to continue his development and play football.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view</h3>
      <p>In the short-term, Gelhardt will benefit from being at Wigan. He is already in and around the first-team and senior minutes will benefit him for the long-term future.</p>
      <p>But Liverpool and Everton cannot afford to ignore this talent. He has already slipped through the net in Merseyside but that can be rectified with a transfer swoop.</p>
