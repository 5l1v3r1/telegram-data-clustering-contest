      <p>Recent flagship smartphones now go after Quad- or Penta-rear camera setup. In addition, the arrangement of these cameras are changing from the usual vertical/horizontal array to something more stylish. Recently, we saw the Vivo V17 which uses a diamond-shape quad-rear camera setup that catches the eye. Now, an official report from Vivo Thailand claims that the Vivo S1 Pro will land in Southeast Asia on November 20th. Interestingly, this smartphone has many <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/14/vivo-v17-real-image-with-a-diamond-quad-camera-appears-online/">similar features with the Vivo V17</a> including the diamond-shape quad-rear camera setup.</p>

      <p>According to report, the Vivo S1 Pro phone uses a dimension of 159.25 × 75.19 × 8.68mm, and the weight of the mobile phone is 186.7g. This is exactly the same as the Vivo V17. This smartphone also comes with a 6.38-inch AMOLED waterdrop screen with a resolution of 1080×2340. Also the same with the V17. This smartphone comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor with up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. The battery differs from that of Vivo V17. While the Vivo S1 Pro comes with a 4500 mAh battery, the V17 uses a smaller 4390 mAh battery.</p>

      <p>The diamond rear quad-camera setup uses a 48MP + 8MP + 2MP + 2MP configuration. On the front, we have a 32MP camera (same as Vivo V17). This smartphone also comes with a gravity sensor, a distance sensor, a light sensor, an on-screen fingerprint sensor, and a fast charge. We want to believe that the “Vivo V17” is for the global version while “Vivo S1 Pro” will be for the Asian region.</p>
