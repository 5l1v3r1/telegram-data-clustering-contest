      <h1>Sofa dumped on roof as fly-tipping 'epidemic' hits new heights</h1>
      <h2>'I can't understand why they don't care enough about our beautiful surroundings to use the local tip!'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:49:18+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/george-morgan/" target="_blank">George Morgan</a></address>
      <p>This attempt to take rubbish dumping to new heights is just one example of the worrying growth in fly-tipping in Wirral.</p>
      <p>Over the last six years, fly-tipping in the borough has risen by nearly 40%, taking the number of incidents above 3000 in the last year.</p>
      <p>Locals are deeply upset about the issue on the Peninsula.</p>
      <p>Posting on the Facebook group <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wirral">Wirral</a> Gossip Original, Lorraine Taylor said: “It’s such a shame that some people think that it’s ok to get rid of their rubbish this way.”</p>

      <p>Commenting on the above picture, Helen Lambert, who lives nearby, said: “I'm not sure how long it's been there. I was walking my hound, along with my son, enjoying the view, when I saw it. I was horrified!</p>
      <p>“So much of it - and such a mess. I felt sorry for the people living in the properties opposite it. Then I saw and spoke to a man I knew and he said it happens all the time.”</p>
      <p>Decrying the problem of fly-tipping more generally, Ms Lambert said: “Yes, it is definitely a problem.</p>
      <p>“I often see it driving around locally - on the stretch of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/eastham">Eastham</a> Rake, under the M53, heading towards Willaston and on the stretch from Allport Road, past Raby and on towards Neston that way.</p>
      <p>“I can't understand why they don't care enough about our beautiful surroundings to use the local tip!”</p>

      <p>Fly-tipping is an issue across the borough. These pictures of Storeton Woods, near Higher <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/bebington">Bebington</a> , are perhaps the most deplorable in this article.</p>
      <p>The mattresses could easily destroy smaller creatures and ruin the view of the pleasant woodland.</p>
      <p>CaIvin Otway, a local delivery driver, sees lots of fly-tipping in the south of the borough: “I don't personally know if it's getting worse, but I see more of it now as i'm a delivery driver for a chemist in Neston.</p>
      <p>“I cover many country lanes and there seems to be quite a lot at various times.”</p>

      <p>Allison Ogden-Newton, chief executive of Keep Britain Tidy, said dumpers often do not realise they are breaking the law.</p>
      <p>For her, education was the answer: “A national programme to educate the public about the dangers and costs of fly-tipping is needed now as we have the evidence of a serious and rapidly escalating problem in this country in how we dispose of our rubbish.</p>
      <p>“We suspect that, bad as these figures are, the reality may be even worse as many incidents of fly-tipping are being categorised as littering so not being counted.</p>
      <p>“We need a programme of education and engagement in every local authority in the country so that the public understands the law and the impact of their behaviour, both financially and environmentally.”</p>
      <p>Ms Ogden-Newton was keen to stress the financial impact of fly-tipping.</p>
      <p>It is costing tax-payers huge amounts of money every year.</p>
      <p>She said: “Our research shows that many people are unaware that they are doing something illegal when they put out black bags or small items, because councils are clearing them up extremely quickly and efficiently to keep our streets clean and not telling people that what they are doing is wrong.</p>
      <p>“The reality is that this is fuelling the fly-tipping epidemic and costing all of us, as tax-payers, many millions to clean up.</p>

      <p>“Britain is becoming a country divided, with more people than ever worrying about the environment and waste and yet equally a growing number of people habitually dumping their rubbish, wrecking that same environment others wish to protect.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wirral-council">Wirral Council</a> said: “The council responds to reports of fly-tipping within five working days to remove fly-tipped waste on the highway and remove dumped waste in alleyways during scheduled cleanses.</p>
      <p>“Proactively, our highways and removals teams engage with residents in a variety of ways. With the assistance of the constituency engagement officers, skip action days and educational leaflet drops are provided to try to deter fly-tipping across the borough.</p>
      <p>“Our teams also help residents to acquire second hand bins to manage their waste to prevent bagged waste being dumped and provide the free ERIC service collections in selective licencing areas.</p>
      <p>“If members of the public see fly-tipped waste they can report it here: www.wirral.gov.uk/flytipping.”</p>
