      <h3>A BILL proposing an armed marshals service to protect members of the judiciary has been filed in the House.</h3>
      <h4>Deputy Speaker and Surigao del Sur Rep. Johnny Pimentel has filed House Bill (HB) No. 5403, establishing the Office of the Philippine Marshals Service under the Supreme Court.</h4>
      <h4>“This is in response to Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta’s call for a marshals service for the judiciary,” Pimentel said.</h4>
      <p>“Right now, every active judge is a sitting duck with absolutely no protection whatsoever against potential attacks,” Pimentel pointed out.</p>
      <p>Pimentel filed his measure days after the November 5 assassination of Tagudin, Ilocos Sur Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 25 Judge Mario Anacleto Bañez.</p>
      <p>Bañez was the second RTC judge murdered this year, after the May 9 killing of Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte RTC Branch 11 Judge Reymar Lacaya, and the 31st member of the judiciary slain while in active service since 1999.</p>
      <p>Under Pimentel’s bill, the marshals service shall be headed by a director to be appointed by the Chief Justice.</p>
      <p>The organizational structure, composition and the size of the service shall be determined by the director and the Chief Justice.</p>
      <p>As proposed by Pimentel, every marshal shall be a bachelor’s degree holder, and shall be at least 21 years old but not older than 35.</p>
      <p>The marshals shall:</p>
      <p>·  Undergo training at the Philippine Public Safety College;</p>
      <p>·  Possess suitable firearms for the proper protection of court officers and properties;</p>
      <p>· Serve as “peace officers” and as such, have the power to conduct arrests, searches and seizures in accordance with existing laws and rules;</p>
      <p>· Investigate and counteract crimes against judicial officers; and take and require sworn truthful statements of any person or persons so summoned in relation to cases under investigation.</p>
      <p>At present, judges are able to obtain close protection officers from the Philippine National Police only upon request on a case-to-case basis.</p>
      <p>“This arrangement is inadequate, given that judges may not readily perceive threats from angry and atrocious litigants,” Pimentel said.</p>
      <p>Based on the judiciary’s staffing summary in the 2019 General Appropriations Act, the country has a total of 2,561 trial judges.</p>
      <p>They are broken down into 1,301 RTC judges; 169 Metro Trial Court judges; 257 City Trial Court judges; 468 Municipal Circuit Trial Court judges; and 366 Municipal Trial Court judges.</p>
      <p>Besides the 15 members of the Supreme Court (SC), there are also 70 justices of the Court of Appeals and nine justices of the Court of Tax Appeals.</p>
