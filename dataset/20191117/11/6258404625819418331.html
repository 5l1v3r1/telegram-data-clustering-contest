      <p>Flagship smartphones have nudged themselves into four-digit pricing territory, with some of the top models commanding a grand, <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/motorolas-reimagined-razr-is-folding-smartphone-triumph">or more</a>. Fortunately, you don't have to go nuts spending a premium on a high-end smartphone to get a capable handset. <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/google-pixel-3a-best-selling-unlocked-phone-amazon">Google's Pixel 3a</a> is a mid-range phone with plenty of spunk, and it's on sale right.<br/><br/>You can find <a href="https://amzn.to/33VHEGe"><b>Google's Pixel 3a for $299.00 on Amazon</b></a> with free shipping. That's 25 percent (save $100) below its list price. It's a fantastic deal, and might just be the bargain to beat in the smartphone category once the wave of <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/best-buy-and-amazon-black-friday-deals">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday deals arrive later this month (we'll be keeping an eye out for bargains, so be sure check back often).<br/><br/>The Pixel 3a is a relatively recent addition to Google's handset family—it launched six months ago as a more affordable alternative to its then-flagship Pixel 3 family (the Pixel 4 series now occupies that spot). We <a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/google-pixel-3a-xl-review">reviewed the Pixel 3a XL</a> model, though other than size (display and battery) and resolution, the core specs and features are the same. Here's a look at what comprises the Pixel 3a...</p>
