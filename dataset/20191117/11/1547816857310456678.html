      <p>In other news, Shweta Tiwari was recently quoted saying at an event that she doesn’t watch Bigg Boss 13 because of her son Reyansh. She said, "No I'm not. I don't have time to watch it. Secondly, when do I watch it. I have a kid at home, in front of him I can't turn it on. If someone talks loudly in front of him, he asks me 'Aapko daanta?' He gets scared. I don't want him to see all of that. Also whenever the TV is on and there's no Doraemon on it, he won't let anyone watch TV. So it's no point."</p>
