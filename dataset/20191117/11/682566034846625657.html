      <p>Cape Town - <b>Nathan Lyon</b> is looking forward to playing one at one of his happy-hunting grounds as <b>Australia</b> prepare for their first Test of the summer against <b>Pakistan</b> that starts in Brisbane on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Spinner Lyon, who has taken 363 Test scalps in 91 games, has a good record in the longest format in Queensland having taken 33 wickets in eight matches at the venue at an average of 27.69.</p>
      <p>The two-match series against Pakistan is a chance for the Aussies to build on the last tour to England where they drew the series 2-2 to retain the famous Ashes urn.</p>
      <p>Lyon told reporters at the Gabba: "We tend to play an extremely exciting brand of cricket here at the Gabba, so I'm very happy, it's one of my favourite places to play, it's great that we've got the first Test here, fingers crossed it's a decent crowd that rolls out for us.</p>
      <p>"The wicket, I reckon it's a good contest between bat and ball, personally I find I get a fair amount of bounce and a bit of spin over the last couple of years as well.</p>
      <p>"I love playing cricket here, for the last nine years I've been playing Test cricket here, everyone's been talking about playing four quicks every time, so it's all part of it and I'm not really concerned what Pakistan do to be honest.</p>
      <p>"It's about us as the Australian cricket team, making sure we're preparing the absolute house down and making sure we're doing everything in our control to make sure we're right to go."</p>
      <p>Australia's Test series against Pakistan will conclude with a day-night Test in Adelaide from 29 November.</p>
