      <p>Varun Dhawan is currently among one of the most sought-after actors of Bollywood. Right from his impressive script selections to the kind of delightful relationship he shares with the media and his fans; everything about Varun is worth admiring. Recently, the Kalank actor was spotted by our shutterbugs; however, they had to literally chase him down. A video of this conversation between the actor and paparazzi has surfaced online and it’s both adorable and hilarious.</p>
      <p>The clip begins with a photographer chasing Varun Dhawan and as he turns back, the paparazzi replies saying, “Bhai aankh mein aasu aagaya follow karte karte,” to which the actor asks him why. Later, he reveals that Varun Dhawan was walking very fast. Soon after, the cameraman compliments Varun, who thanks him and proceeds to sweetly apologise, stating that he couldn’t see him due to his black glares. LOL! For the day, Varun Dhawan was sporting a black shirt with a white inner and grey denim. He looked dapper as ever.</p>

      <p>Yesterday, the Sui Dhaaga actor had treated fans with a goofy video on the occasion of Children’s Day. Soon after Varun posted the video, he got trolled by his industry colleagues and co-stars like Arjun Kapoor, Anushka Sharma and Jacqueline Fernandez.</p>
