      <p>On December 8th, 2019, J. Greenstein &amp; Co.’s Auction House (<a href="http://www.jgreenstein.com/">www.jgreenstein.com</a>), the world renowned source for antique and rare Judaica, will host its bi-annual Judaica auction devoted solely to rare Jewish artifacts.

      <p>Marilyn Monroe converted to Judaism in 1956 at the same time as her marriage to American playwright Arthur Miller.

The first, dated August 4, 1934 to Kenneth Wasserman from Mrs. A. Braunstein, and then apparently re-gifted to Mrs. Marilyn Cooper-Smith from Kenneth Wasserman who inscribed “To Mrs. Marilyn Cooper-Smith - I wish you to keep this bible with (which?) you are married (?).”</p>
