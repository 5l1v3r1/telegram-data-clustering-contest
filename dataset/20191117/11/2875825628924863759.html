      <h1>Iranian Hulk signs up for bare-knuckle boxing after vowing to fight ISIS</h1>
      <h2>Sajad Gharibi is known as the "Iranian Hulk" - and the huge powerlifter has now signed up for his Bare-Knuckle Fighting Championship debut</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:32:46+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:32</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Internet sensation Sajad Gharibi, known as the "Iranian Hulk" due to his sheer size and huge chest, has signed up with the Bare-Knuckle Fighting Championship.</p>
      <p>The 6ft2 giant has an abnormally large frame, weighing 390 pounds (177kg), and has built up a sizeable following with his eye-catching physique.</p>
      <p>The massive powerlifter has over 450k <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> followers, where he regularly posts pictures showing off his bulging chest, lats and arms.</p>
      <p>He has now joined the Bare-Knuckle Fighting Championship roster and is set to enter the ring for a fight which will no doubt raise plenty of eyebrows.</p>
      <p>Whilst he is now vowing to fight in the ring, Gharib previously stated his desire to join the fight against Isis.</p>

      <p>In an impassioned video back in 2016, Gharib claimed he wanted to join the Iranian Armed Forces to fight the Islamic State in the Syrian Civil War.</p>
      <p>he said: "First of all, I want to say that I'm a defender of my country.</p>
      <p>"General Soleimani, all the martyrs and the selfless people who give their lives for our country are my heroes, and we have them to thank for the peace in our country.</p>

      <p>"I will always be a soldier for my country ...</p>
      <p>"The second thing is that, after Ramadan, I hope to start up my training again and reach my goal, in two or three years, to be in good enough shape to be of service to my country."</p>

      <p>It is not the first time the Iranian Hulk has looked set to test his strength in combat sports.</p>
      <p>He was due to fight British bodybuilder Martyn Ford in an event set up by Polish MMA organisation KSW, but that never materialised.</p>

      <p>He was also challenged by UFC featherweight star Brian Ortega, who claimed he would smash him despite weighing 240lbs less.</p>
      <p>A "Battle of the Hulks" with Brazilian Hulk Romario dos Santos Alves has also been touted but not yet come to fruition.</p>
      <p>It is unclear who he will face on his Bare-Knuckle Fighting Championship debut, in the same organisation which hit the headlines when former boxing world champion Paulie Malignaggi took on Artem Lobov.</p>
