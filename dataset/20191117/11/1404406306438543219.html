      <p>Recently, <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/258915/update-lil-reese-reportedly-in-critical-condition-after-being-shot-in-the">news surfaced that Lil Reese was shot in Chicago, and reportedly suffered a gunshot wound to the neck</a>. Authorities said a gunman allegedly shot the rapper with a small rifle. Since then, the rapper has hopped on IG Live to show that he is good. While on Twitter, a fan suggested to Reese that DJ Vlad was going to try and get the first interview of the rapper since being shot “by any means.”</p>
      <p>Reese saw the tweet and responded, saying, “Tell him I need a million for this story this s**t ain’t fake or free s**t bigger [than] 50 Rick Ross and whoever [else].”</p>
      <p>Vlad responded by saying, “Very happy that you survived that shooting. But nobody’s going to pay you even 1% of $1 million for that interview.” Take a look above.</p>
