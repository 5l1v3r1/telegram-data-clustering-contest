        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/simon-cowell/">Simon Cowell</a> has even more reason to rock the open shirt look these days after his recent weight loss, and he couldn’t look any happier.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The TV mogul was spotted leaving ITV’s studios on Saturday night after the latest <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a>: Celebrity live show, and he seemed to be in good spirits despite <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/left-x-factor-celebrity-fourth-live-show-11169786/">losing Glee star Kevin McHale in the sing-off with Vinnie Jones</a>.</p>
      <p>As he headed to his waiting car, Simon flashed the widest smile while rocking an even bigger gap in his white shirt, which was unbuttoned halfway down his chest flashing a lot of chest hair.</p>
      <p>Still rocking his navy blue suit worn earlier during the show, Simon gave photographers two thumbs up and even blew a kiss to his adoring fans.</p>
      <p>Wowza, maybe he should rock an open shirt more often.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Simon was forced to rubbish claims that his 20lbs <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/27/simon-cowell-slams-claims-gastric-band-credits-20lb-weight-loss-cutting-fatty-foods-10640915/">weight loss was the result of a gastric bypass.</a></p>

      <p>Speaking to Best magazine, Si-Co said: ‘People have said: “Oh, he’s had a gastric band fitted” – but I haven’t. If I had, I would admit to it. This diet is all about what you put into your body.</p>

      <p>‘I met this doctor in LA and he told me my diet was appalling and I had to cut out fatty foods and certain drinks. I could see the difference. Cutting out sugar made a massive difference. The first few weeks were difficult, but then I actually stopped craving sugar.’</p>
      <p>He revealed: ‘I had also found a brilliant gluten-free beer, which helps. The hardest part is when I see Eric eat pizza in front of me. That’s really tough.’</p>
      <p>Last night’s X Factor had been a tough one for Simon after Vinnie pleaded with him to save Kevin and send himself home in the sing-off.</p>
      <p>‘Simon…I feel that I’ve had a fantastic time, I’ve really enjoyed it – it’s been everything I’ve needed since my wife’s passing. This guy is a real singer, I think he can win it, for his career, I would like to step down and let him go through,’ Vinnie said.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>But Simon decided: ‘The last person in the world I would like to have a fall out with is Vinnie Jones, which means we’re going to have to fall out because I’m going to insist that you stay in the competition.</p>
      <p>‘This is not disrespect to Kevin, I am voting with my heart…I think you have a chance of winning this competition still.’</p>
