      <p>With the release of <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/call-of-duty">Call of Duty Modern Warfare</a> proving to be very popular with fans (both old and new) to the franchise, there is an inescapable truth about all <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/games">games</a> of this type. Namely, that sooner or later, a <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/battle-royale">battle royale</a> mode is bound to be added.</p>
      <p>It’s a trend that, love it or loathe it, few developers are currently brave enough to ignore for too long.</p>
      <p>So, why do we mention this? Well, following a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dx4me0/battle_royale_coming_to_modern_warfare_map/">Reddit</a> post a user has conducted a huge datamine of the game’s files and believes they have found at least some clues as to what we can expect!</p>

      <h3>Call of Duty Modern Warfare Battle Royale</h3>
      <p>Having found some of the map files, the ‘battle royale’ location is believed to have been identified as well as some of the key ‘points of interest’ on it. Digging a little deeper, however, the battle royale mode (based on the map and other information) is shaping up to be one of the most ambitious to date with a rumoured 200 players being able to participate in a single game.</p>
      <p>Some of the key mode features have been listed as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Player Count: 200</li>
        <li>Playlists: Solo (1), Duos (2), and Squads (4)</li>
        <li>End-Game Radar: On</li>
        <li>Infiltration Option: C130</li>
        <li>Pre-Game Lobby Free-for-All: On</li>
        <li>Post-Game Exfiltration: Off</li>
        <li>Max Health: 150</li>
        <li>Last Stand Health: 100 / Revive Health: 30 / Timer: 60s / Revive Time: 7s</li>
        <li>Friendly Fire Punish Limit: 2</li>
        <li>Gulag: On</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Will It Be Popular?</h3>
      <p>This new trend of game mode is certainly not loved by all. As I said earlier, however, this Call of Duty is (perhaps surprisingly) really striking a chord with the community. As such, as and when this arrives, we can see this game mode being hugely popular.</p>
      <p>Will it be as good as the standard multiplayer modes? Who can say… I must admit though, as someone who isn’t a particularly huge fan of battle royale games, I am intrigued enough to probably give it more than a few goes.</p>
