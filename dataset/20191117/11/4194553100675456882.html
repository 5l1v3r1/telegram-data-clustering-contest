      <h1>Why Flamengo are desperate to play Liverpool in the FIFA Club World Cup</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:10:45+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Brazilian outfit Flamengo are looking to face off against Liverpool in the FIFA Club World Cup this season, in what could be a repeat of the 1981 Intercontinental Cup final.</p>
      <p>The Reds were humbled 3-0 by the ‘<i>Rubro-Negro</i>‘, and O Globo journalist Bruno Marinho reckons the Brazilians would fancy another crack at Liverpool.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-ultimate-target-brazilian-side-17268388">Speaking to the Liverpool Echo</a>, Marinho says that the game in 1981 is regarded as the biggest moment in the history of Flamengo.</p>
      <p>“<b>It means a lot to them. In Rio we have four traditional teams, and only Flamengo have won the Club World Cup,</b>” <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-ultimate-target-brazilian-side-17268388">he said</a>.</p>
      <p>“<b>This means a lot to people in Brazil, who are passionate about football. They love to make fun of the neighbouring clubs, and Flamengo always have this over the other teams.</b></p>
      <p>“<b>It’s also special because it was the main conquest of the best Flamengo team of all time.</b></p>
      <p>“<b>They had an amazing team, the greatest player being Zico. They also had Junior at left-back and Leandro at right-back and were strong throughout the team.</b></p>
      <p>“<b>Destiny has now given them a chance to play Liverpool again in a new Club World Cup final. They are focused on River Plate now, but in the end they are looking for Liverpool – a lot!</b>”</p>
      <p>I actually love this kind of stuff – playing some of the world’s biggest teams on our own European conquests, and the rare chance to play clubs from other continents is brilliant.</p>
      <p>Back in the day, when Liverpool were dominating the world, the Reds helped Scousers introduce a lot of new fashion and music into the north of England because of their travels around the globe.</p>
      <p>European football naturally dominates our interests, but we’ve got a chapter with Flamengo in this, and it appears as if it may not be over yet!</p>
