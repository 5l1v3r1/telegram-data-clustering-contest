      <h3>THE Philippines’ Sisi Rondina and Bernadeth Pons proved too much to Hong Kong’s Yeung Wai Yan and Koo Yung Yung, 21-14, 21-10, to book a ticket to the women’s Finals of the 2019 Rebisco Beach Volleyball International Open yesterday at the Sands SM By The Bay.</h3>
      <p>Aside from her smart plays and attacks, Rondina had a couple of solid blocks in the opening set to frustrate Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>“Lagi kaming nag-uusap in the past five games,” said Rondina after her solid partnership with Pons remained perfect in the tournament presented by Larong Volleyball sa Pilipinas Inc., in cooperation with Beach Volleyball Republic.</p>
      <p>Rondina and Pons are the country’s best medal hopes in the 30th Southeast Asian Games later this month in Subic.</p>
      <p>The other Filipina pair in the SEA Games, Dij Rodriguez and Dzi Gervacio, downed New Zealand’s Renei Ursem and Olivia Macdonald, 21-14, 21-14, to set up a finals encounter with Rondina and Pons in the Finals.</p>
      <p>Rodriguez and Gervacio are also perfect in five matches.</p>
      <p>It will be also an All-Filipino championship in the men’s side, with KR Guzman and Jaron Requinton battling it out with Efraim Dimaculangan and Rancel Varga for the crown.</p>
      <p>Guzman and Requinton continued to roll following a 21-16, 21-19 conquest of top-ranked Edmar Bonono and Jude Garcia in the semifinals.       Dimaculangan and Varga topped DMM-Thailand 2’s Chaiphichit Khongin and Chairat Hanrasa, 21-17, 21-18, in the other pairing.</p>
      <p>The championship matches are being played as of press time.</p>
      <p>In the women’s quarterfinals, Rondina and Pons topped Kasim Bundit University-Thailand 1’s Pawarun Chanthawichai and Mukdao Suchamnong, 21-16, 21-12, while Rodriguez and Gervacio scored a 21-14, 21-11 win over KBU Thailand 2’s Paweena Wong-Aksorn and Duanpen Arsa.</p>
      <p>In the men’s quarters, Bonono and Garcia made short work of Hong Kong 1’s Kenneth Yun and Matthew Wang 21-10, 21-16, to become the first semifinalist.</p>
      <p>Guzman and Requinton bested the Philippines’ second team of Krung Arbasto and James Buytrago, 21-18, 14-21, 15-7, to set up an all-Filipino semis duel with Bonono and Garcia.</p>
      <p>Khongin and Hanrasa became the last men’s international pair standing after sweeping the Filipino pair of Pemie Bagalay and Pol Salvador, 21-14, 21-14.</p>
      <p>Dimaculangan and Varga then beat Kam Lung Chui of Hong Kong and Brian Nordberg of United, 21-15, 21-12, to complete the semis cast.</p>
