      <p>Nicole Scherzinger is secretly dating <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a>: Celebrity contestant Thom Evans after splitting from tennis star Grigor Dimitrov earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old Pussycat Dolls singer and the 34-year-old rugby star spent a romantic evening together according to reports, with insiders claiming that the pair flirted for weeks before the Try Star member plucked up the courage to ask her out.</p>
      <p>‘Thom is completely Nicole’s type,’ a source revealed. ‘And for his part, Thom was smitten early on — he’s always said Nicole is one of the most beautiful women in the world.</p>
      <p>‘He fancied her long before meeting her on the show. He was initially a bit nervous about starting something up and ruining his chances on the series, but they had great chemistry from the off.’</p>
      <p>The insider continued to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10361248/nicole-scherzinger-secretly-dating-thom-evans/">The Sun</a>: ‘And after weeks of texting, Thom finally plucked up the courage to ask her out, and took her for dinner.’</p>

      <p>At the beginning of the series,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/12/simon-cowell-makes-dig-lewis-hamilton-nicole-scherzinger-sweats-ben-foden-x-factor-celebrity-10905396/"> Nicole was seriously excited to see the three heartthrobs with their torses out</a> as they entered the stage with their shirts unbuttoned.</p>
      <p>‘Hello, who do we have here?’ the panelist purred.</p>
      <p>‘I’m really excited about this,’ Simon Cowell grinned, but that was nothing on his co-judge.</p>
      <p>‘Me too, I’m also excited about this shirt right now. How it just hangs, freely and openly… and your chesticles,’ she gasped.</p>
      <p>But after Nicole’s on-off romance with Lewis Hamilton and relationship with tennis hero Grigor, Simon jumped in: ’Not another sport’s star…’</p>
