      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> has sensationally claimed he suffered from a medical condition which stopped him sweating.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York revealed the condition – which is known as anhidrosis – in a Newsnight interview with presenter Emily Maitlis, who questioned him over claims he slept with a 17-year-old girl in 2001.</p>
      <p>Virginia Giuffre, formerly known as Virginia Roberts, claims she was sex trafficked by billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and forced to have sex with the prince three times between 2001 and 2002.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Ms Maitlis said Mrs Guiffre had been ‘very specific’ about meeting Andrew at the Tramp nightclub on March 10, 2001 – when she was 17 – claiming the duke was ‘profusely sweating’.</p>
      <p>But the duke said there was a ‘slight problem’ with that story as he was allegedly unable to perspire at the time.</p>
      <p>He claimed: ‘I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time.</p>

      <p>‘…I didn’t sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simply… it was almost impossible for me to sweat.’</p>
      <p>He said it was only because he had ‘done a number of things in the recent past’ that he was able to sweat again.</p>
      <p>Since last night’s interview – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-interview-described-nuclear-explosion-level-bad-11169720/">which has been described as ‘nuclear explosion level bad’</a> – a picture of Andrew ‘sweating’ as he runs down a street has gone viral.</p>
      <p>It shows Andrew after a night out at club Chinawhites in 2000, but it appears the viral photo may have been edited to make him look sweatier.</p>
      <p>Some medical experts have answered questions about adrenaline after Andrew’s claim that it triggered a condition that stopped him sweating.</p>

      <p>GP Jon Hall-Jones, who specialises in dermatology, said adrenaline is more likely to cause sweating, not stop it.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>He told Metro.co.uk: ‘Adrenaline is a hormone that stimulates the body as part of the fight or flight response.</p>
      <p>‘Sweating is part of this response that occurs because the sweat glands are responsive to adrenaline.’</p>
      <p>Professor John Hawk, a dermatologist at London’s King’s College and St Thomas’ Hospital, said trauma is ‘not a known cause’ of the condition after Andrew said it was brought on after being shot at during the Falklands War.</p>
      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1205489/prince-Andrew-health-sweat-Virginia-Roberts-jeffery-Epstein-BBC-newsnight">Express</a>: ‘Most cases are inherited, which does not seem to be the case here.</p>
      <p>‘Other causes include heat stroke – which seems unlikely in the Falklands, severe dehydration, and certain medications including morphine could also cause it, but these are not likely.</p>
      <p>‘Maybe there was a supplementary event that happened which he cannot remember. Trauma is not a known cause of this condition.’</p>
      <p>According to the Mayo Clinic in the US, anhidrosis occurs when your sweat glands don’t function properly.</p>
      <p>This is either as a result of a condition people are born with or one that affects their nerves or skin.</p>
      <h3>What causes anhidrosis?</h3>
      <p>Conditions you’re born with, such as certain congenital dysplasias that affect the development of sweat glands</p>
      <p>Inherited conditions that affect your metabolic system, such as Fabry’s disease</p>
      <p>Connective tissue diseases, such as Sjogren’s syndrome, which causes dry eyes and mouth</p>
      <p>Skin damage, such as from burns or radiation therapy, or diseases that clog your pores (poral occlusion), such as psoriasis</p>
      <p>Conditions that cause nerve damage (neuropathy), such as diabetes, alcoholism and Guillain-Barre syndrome</p>
      <p>Certain drugs, such as morphine and botulinum toxin type A, and those used to treat psychosis</p>
