      <p>Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala urged the Union Minister of Human Resource Development, Dr Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank to include climate change and sustainability as subjects in the education curriculum. Taking to Twitter, Chautala released a press note stating the major challenges being faced by the developed countries and how it impacts the health of every citizen.</p>
      <blockquote>"Keeping in view the fact that climate change is one of the major challenges being faced by developing countries including us, which has severe impact on the health of every citizen, therefore climate change and sustainability classes as a pan of curriculum in education policy should be introduced throughout the country," a press note by Chautala on Saturday read.</blockquote>

      <p>Further citing the example of Venice, he stated that Italy has become the first country to have 'Climate Change and sustainability Classes' compulsory in school to explore the possibility to combat the problem. He also raised concern over the issue of the increasing pollution in the national capital region (NCR) region "which had converted the whole region as gas chamber" (sic), in the letter written to the Union Minister.</p>
