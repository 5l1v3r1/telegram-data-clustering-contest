      <p>“I have told the players that the game against Ghana is behind us, there is nothing we can do about it. Yes, we are not happy with the loss but we can’t change the result, so we have to focus on what is ahead of us – and this time it is Sudan,” Ntseki told the media.</p>
      <p>“We are playing in front of our fans, we lost three points in Ghana, and now we must come out firing on all cylinders against Sudan. We need to be aggressive from the first whistle because in the qualifiers if you don’t win your home games you are as good as not making in the to the next stage. We have suffered a setback but now we need to get our campaign back on track.”</p>
      <p>“Football is a funny game – if you don’t pitch up on the day you will go home empty handed. We have to forget about the past results and work in the present.”</p>
      <p>“We have selected 25 players that we have confidence in, so there will be some changes to refresh the team a bit as we also take into consideration that there was some heavy travel in between – for us this is a must-win, no other results will matter,” he added.</p>
