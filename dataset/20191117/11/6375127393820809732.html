      <h1>Emergency fund for farmers eyed</h1>

      <h3>A HOUSE leader on Sunday said he would file this week a measure allowing the Duterte administration to use all rice import tariff collections in excess of the P10-billion Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (RCEF) for setting up a special emergency fund for farmers affected by softening farmgate prices  following its recent market deregulation.</h3>
      <p>Deputy Speaker and Camaranines Sur Rep. LRay Villafuerte said he will file this week a joint resolution to provide this congressional authorization for an immediate special fund to enable the Department of Agriculture (DA) to distribute direct cash transfers to small farmers to help them cope with low palay prices this main harvest season as a result of the lifting of quantitative restrictions (QRs) on imports under the rice trade liberalization law.</p>
      <p>“Farmgate prices of dry palay dropped by as much as P10 per kilo in several rice-producing areas following the implementation of Republic Act (RA) No. 11203 or the Rice Tariffication Law (RTL) in March this year, resulting in  “huge income losses for rice farmers and the industry, which is now estimated at around P50 billion at current prices,” said Villafuerte.</p>
      <p>To modernize the farm sector and make local palay growers globally competitive, RA No. 11203 provides for the creation of the RCEF, which shall have an annual appropriation of P10 billion over the next six years, to be sourced from the tariff revenues collected by the Bureau of Customs (BoC) from rice imports.</p>
      <p>Villafuerte noted that from the time the law took effect in March up to end-October this year, BOC collections from rice import tariffs have already reached P11.4 billion, or an excess of P1.4 billion in revenues supposedly earmarked for RCEF.</p>
      <p>The excess amount plus subsequent BoC collections till the yearend should be channeled, he said, to his proposed Rice Farmer Financial Assistance program to bankroll a cash transfer system for palay farmers—similar to the cash subsidies that low-income households and other vulnerable sectors are now getting separately from the social protection initiatives of different government agencies.</p>
