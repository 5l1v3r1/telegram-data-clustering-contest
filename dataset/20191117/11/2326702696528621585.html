      <p>I have to admit that I have more than a little soft spot for <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/thermaltake">Thermaltake</a> as a brand. Particularly their <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/chassis">chassis</a> designs of which I’m currently using two for my own personal system builds. So, when they announce that a new case is hitting the market, they definitely have my attention!</p>

      <h3>Thermaltake Commander G Series</h3>
      <p>As part of the new Commander range, Thermaltake has introduced 3 new chassis designs. So, what’s the difference between them? Well, with them all being mid-tower designs (as far as we can ascertain) the main key separating factor is the aesthetic design to the front.</p>
      <p>As you can see in the image above, while on a similar theme, there is a nice selection to choose from depending on what catches your eye best.</p>

      <h3>What Does Thermaltake have to Say?</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“The Commander G Series Tempered Glass ARGB Edition mid-tower chassis is a brand-new high airflow case designed with a special mesh front panel. This entry-level chassis comes with a preinstalled 200mm ARGB fan that can be controlled via motherboard synchronization software or the RGB switch on the I/O port. Located at the rear of the chassis there is another 120mm standard fan preinstalled for outstanding ventilation. Other outstanding features include a 4mm tempered glass panel, a riser GPU support bracket, and removable magnetic filters for overall exceptional pc performance which is the deal for both gamers and enthusiasts.”</i>

      <h3>What Do We Think?</h3>
      <p>At the risk of waxing lyrical, I really like the designs that Thermaltake has created here. Given that the Commander Series is particularly pushing vertical graphics card mounting and high-levels of dust prevention, they’re certainly going to appeal to both the average the enthusiast PC consumer.</p>
      <p>No prices have been confirmed yet, but we’ll let you know as soon as they start hitting retail shelves. Which should be any moment now!</p>
      <p>For more information on the chassis design releases, you can check out the official Thermaltake product announcement page <a href="https://www.thermaltake.com/news/view/index?id=746">via the link here!</a></p>
