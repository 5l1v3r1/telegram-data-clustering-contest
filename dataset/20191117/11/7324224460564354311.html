      <p>Social services wrongly believed IRA abduction victim Jean McConville had “abandoned” her children, her son said.</p>
      <p>Michael McConville wants a public inquiry after he was “let down” by child carers, the church, and police he accused of failing to properly investigate his mother’s disappearance.</p>
      <p>Her orphaned offspring were not offered counselling, despite having to watch their mother being forced from their west Belfast home in December 1972.</p>
      <p>The Provisionals wrongly believed the mother-of-10 was passing on information to the state.</p>
      <p>Mr McConville said the trauma from the kidnapping when he was 11 was neverending.</p>
      <aside>It is a smear on her name<cite>Michael McConville</cite></aside>
      <p>“It is something that will never leave us for the rest of our lives, we are stuck with it every day.</p>
      <p>“When we were being put into care one of the social workers turned round and said we were abandoned children.”</p>
      <p>He added: “It is a smear on her name.”</p>
      <p>She was taken across the border to the Republic, badly beaten and shot in the back of the head.</p>
      <p>Her remains were found by a walker in August 2003 on a beach in Co Louth and Mr McConville said forensic opportunities were lost by Irish police.</p>
      <p>The case was part of a special investigation established to find the remains of those taken by the IRA and known as the Disappeared.</p>
      <p>A condition of that team’s work was that it did not gather forensic information useful to a criminal investigation, to encourage witnesses to come forward.</p>
      <p>Ms McConville was found by a walker rather than during a search organised by the investigation; the scene could have been checked for opportunities for prosecution, but was not.</p>
      <p>Mr McConville said the information collected by police following the abduction stretched to only two pages.</p>

      <p>“They did not think the kidnapping of my mother was important.”</p>
      <p>Ivor Bell was recently found not guilty of involvement in the murder, after recordings of him during an oral history project were deemed inadmissible by the court.</p>
      <p>Mr McConville wants a public inquiry into his mother’s murder, focusing on alleged lack of support by social services and questions surrounding the Catholic church.</p>
      <p>He said he would like to see a judge from outside Northern Ireland leading such a probe.</p>
      <p>He added: “We have been let down by everyone.</p>
      <p>“We have been let down by the British Government, the Irish Government, let down by the gardai in recent years.”</p>
      <p>Former police ombudsman Dame Nuala O’Loan published a report in 2006 which confirmed that police did not investigate her disappearance for 20 years.</p>
      <p>Mr McConville said: “As a family we want the truth, we have been told lies from 1972 to the present day.”</p>
