      <p>Actress Helen George has spoken in defence of the Duchess of Sussex, who she said “women are tearing down” for being “different”.</p>
      <p>The Call The Midwife star contrasted “hostility” towards Meghan with praise for another “unconventional” woman, award-winning actress and playwright, Phoebe Waller-Bridge.</p>
      <p>George, 35, made the comparison in an interview with the Mail On Sunday’s Event magazine about her latest role as the female protagonist in My Cousin Rachel.</p>

      <p>The play – based on a Daphne du Maurier novel – follows Philip, a young man in Cornwall who suspects his cousin Ambrose’s wife, Rachel, of being responsible for his death.</p>
      <p>Miss George plays Rachel, a character she describes as “outrageously bohemian” within a traditional Cornish community in 19th century England.</p>
      <p>She said: “I think the way Rachel was viewed smacks of our current situation with Meghan Markle and the treatment she gets simply because she is a woman who is not doing things in the way this establishment – the Royal Family – do them.</p>
      <p>“She is different and that engenders hostility.”</p>

      <p>George added: “I have always been a feminist, but I’m now living through an era where women are tearing down Meghan Markle for not behaving like a traditional member of the Royal Family, while at the same time Phoebe Waller-Bridge is being heaped with awards and praise for Fleabag, a drama series about a woman most definitely not behaving in a conventional manner for a woman.</p>
      <p>“It’s completely crazy.”</p>
      <p>George has played glamorous midwife Trixie in BBC drama Call The Midwife since the show first aired in 2012.</p>
      <p>The actress, who took part in Strictly Come Dancing in 2015, gave birth to her daughter, Wren, in 2017.</p>
