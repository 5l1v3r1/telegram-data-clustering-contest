      <h1>Labour manifesto policies in full: All confirmed general election pledges so far</h1>
      <h2>Labour has agreed a manifesto for the 2019 general election which is, by all accounts, even more radical than in 2017. Exact details haven't yet been published, but here's what we know will, or probably will, be in it so far</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:07:22+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:07</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Labour has agreed its "transformative" manifesto to take into the 2019 <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> .</p>
      <p>And by all accounts, it's even more radical than in 2017.</p>
      <p>The document is expected to promise nationalised mail, rail, water, energy and broadband, free NHS prescriptions and six years' free adult education in England.</p>
      <p>It's expected to pledge a £10 minimum wage for all over-16s, an ambition to reach a 32-hour working week over a decade and the end of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/what-universal-credit-benefit-explained-13390461">Universal Credit</a> .</p>
      <p>But the full document will only be published at the launch on Thursday.</p>
      <p>So for now we have listed the confirmed policies announced so far during the campaign - plus ones that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> pushed out so recently, they're very likely to be in the document.</p>
      <p> </p>
