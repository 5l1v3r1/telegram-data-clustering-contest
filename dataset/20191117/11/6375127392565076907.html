      <h3>CAVITE Rep. Elpidio “Pidi” Barzaga, Jr. on Sunday commended his colleagues led by Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano, House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez and House Committee on Appropriations chairman Isidro Ungab of Davao City for ensuring that the House-approved version of the 2020 P4.1 trillion General Appropriations Bill (GAB) was pork-free.</h3>
      <p>“The national budget transmitted by the House of Representatives to the Senate was pork-free, bereft of any illegal parking of funds and insertions,” Barzaga, President of the National Unity Party (NUP), pointed out.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Sen. Panfilo “Ping” Lacson said the money measure has no “pork” and even urged the Senate to simply adopt the transmitted version of the House of Representatives.</p>
      <p>By December the House of Representatives and the Senate will meet in the bicameral conference committee to reconcile the disagreeing provisions of the national budget.</p>
      <p>Barzaga, the chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, reiterated that the lower chamber leadership is always committed to ensure the timely passage of the national budget that “is constitutional, legal, transparent and accountable.”</p>
      <p>“The House leadership is committed to pass the national budget without delays because these are extremely harmful and the entire economy suffers. The money measure is our vehicle for national development and advance the President’s vision to guarantee a better and comfortable life for Filipinos,” Barzaga stressed.</p>
