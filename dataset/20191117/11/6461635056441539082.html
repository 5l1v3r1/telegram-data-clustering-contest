      <h3>Pierre- Emerick Aubameyang has established himself as one of the most feared strikers in the whole of football and is wanted by Barcelona.</h3>
      <p>Naturally, his form has attracted many eyes including the Barcelona’s. <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/transfer-news/pierre-emerick-aubameyang-real-madrid-17266008"><b>As per Football London</b></a>, Aubameyang could have probable interest in featuring for Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>Whilst at Bortmund Aubameyang revealed that he made a promise to his grandfather about playing for the Blaugrana’s arch rivals Real Madrid in the future. Hence it is highly likely that Aubameyang does want to play for the Whites at some point in his career.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang has been in lethal form off late having found the net 9 times from 13 games in the Premier League. His speed and selflessness on the pitch has what impressed the Spanish giants who are looking to sign a successor to Luis Suarez.</p>
      <p>Barca are yet to make an official move for the striker but it is believed that they are keen on landing him in January. However, it is highly unlikely that the deal is going to materialise as the 30 year-old is more inclined towards Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang has certainly impressed some serious eyes in the recent past and it is expected to have rumors surrounding him. His addition to the squad would be great for Ernesto Valverde’s side as Suarez has been inconsistent in recent times.</p>
      <p>Having said that, the Catalans should look for better alternatives keeping in mind the major squad overhaul. It is highly unlikely that Aubameyang’s form will remain the same with age and Barcelona should look for some younger prospects.</p>
