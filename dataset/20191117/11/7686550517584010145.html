      <h1>Joe Marler calls for key law change to stop 'cowardly' act at scrummages</h1>
      <h2>He caused a social media stir following Harlequins' Heineken Champions Cup defeat at Clermont</h2>

      <p>Joe Marler is demanding World Rugby cracks down on a 'cowardly' act at scrummages following Harlequins' Heineken Champions Cup defeat at Clermont Auvergne on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The loosehead didn't play at the Stade Marcel Michelin after helping England reach the Rugby World Cup final earlier this month.</p>
      <p>But the 29-year-old certainly caused a social media stir after their 53-28 defeat, demanding better policing at the set-piece.</p>

      <p>The 68-times-capped prop pointed accusing fingers at rival front-rowers, who push after the scrum collapses and demanded rugby chiefs drive it out of the game.</p>
      <p>"Pushing after the scrum collapses to try and convince the ref youâ€™re dominating is cowardly and needs outlawing," he tweeted out.</p>

      <p>It's unclear whether Marler was having a direct blast at the powerful Clermont front-row, with Quins' clash across the Channel beset by a number of collapsed scrums in the first period leading to time-consuming resets.</p>
      <p>But his social media blast gained some traction with close on 2,000 reactions to his comment.</p>
      <p>With Marler and England team-mate Kyle Sinckler missing, Welsh international hooker Scott Baldwin was without two renowned props for the Euro opener with Clermont.</p>
      <p>And it told early on with the hosts winning two penalties in the opening two scrums of the match and won a free-kick with the third for a crooked feed.</p>
      <p>Head coach Paul Gustard was the first to admit that following the match, pinpointing the scrum as the "Achilles heel".</p>
      <p>"Our scrum was kind of our Achilles heel in the first half," he explained.</p>
      <p>"Second half we turned the scrum around and gained ascendancy, but unfortunately then our lineout suffered a little bit."</p>
