      <h1>Oculus and Unity offer new intermediate-level guide to making VR games</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:13:49+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://venturebeat.com/author/ian-hamilton-uploadvr/" target="_blank">Ian Hamilton, UploadVR</a></address>
      <p>Facebook’s <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/13/john-carmack-moves-to-consulting-cto-role-at-oculus/">Oculus</a> and <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/08/arm-partners-with-unity-to-make-3d-run-everywhere/">Unity Technologies</a> are offering a <a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/11/13/level-up-your-vr-skills-with-a-free-new-course-from-unity-and-oculus/">20-hour intermediate guide</a> to building a VR game.</p>
      <p>The new guide is designed to introduce people to VR development by teaching them how to use tools like Unity, <a href="https://uploadvr.com/vrtk-v4-beta-release/">VRTK</a> and the Oculus software development kit together to build a simple puzzle in a simulated escape room. The project features a series of experts from Unity and Oculus with an introduction by Chris Pruett, Director of Content Ecosystem at Oculus.</p>
      <p>“The audience for VR software today is looking for high quality software of complexity and scope that they would find on other platforms,” Pruett said. “One thing to keep in mind is that, sort of the age of tech demos, is over.”</p>
      <p>For those unfamiliar, Unity is the toolset used by the most game developers, and VR developers, to construct interactive 3D worlds.  The course is built around developing a title for the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/rift-s/?locale=en_US">Oculus Rift PC-powered platform</a> and if you’re new to VR, Unity also offers an <a href="https://learn.unity.com/course/unity-basics">introduction to Unity course</a> and an <a href="https://learn.unity.com/tutorials?k=%5B%22lang%3Aen%22%2C%22sl%3Abeginner%22%2C%22prm%3Anone_premium%22%2C%22tag%3A5900b95a090915001e654b47%22%5D&amp;ob=recency">intro to VR tutorial</a>.</p>
      <p>Also check out our guide to see if your <a href="https://uploadvr.com/pc-vr-ready-check/">PC is ready for a VR headset</a> attached to it. If you’re more interested in building something for the Oculus Quest standalone, keep in mind the <a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-link-beta/">Oculus Link Beta is launching soon</a> that’ll turn the <a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-quest-review/">impressive</a> wireless headset into a Rift. Note also that it is much <a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-quest-store-curation/">harder to win approval</a> for release on Facebook’s VR store for standalones as compared with the Rift.</p>
