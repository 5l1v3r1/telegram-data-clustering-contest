      <p>Emezi's debut is a gorgeous and triumphant novel about surviving, healing, finding the self, and transcendence. The prose itself feels like a character, it's so alive. And the ­format — this is a story told by the various Igbo spirits that inhabit our half-Nigerian ­protagonist — is everything I've ever wanted from a book.</p>

      <p>This is one of my favorite examples of a novel that critically remixes the canon. LaValle takes one of H.P. Lovecraft's most horrific and racist tales — 1924's "The Horror at Red Hook" — and injects it with a heart and new life by adding the perspective of a new character, a young black hustler named Tommy Tester. A tale about an occult presence in an immigrant New York City neighborhood becomes something rebellious and ­ferocious — a masterpiece.</p>

      <p>This is a haunting novel about a haunted man. Ka, a poet, lives in a small Turkish town near the Armenian border where a local college's mandate for women to remove their head scarves has led to an epidemic of suicides. <i>Snow</i> is a thriller that feels deeply intimate and melancholy even when it soars.</p>

      <p>Okri's sprawling, Booker Prize–­winning epic about a kid caught between life and death in Nigeria is unruly and brilliant in all the right ways, with prose that seems to run and shimmy off the page.</p>

      <p>This is a creepy, beautiful, complex story of longing and loss from one of Sudan's pre-­eminent writers, centered on one man's confession to another. Stirring prose and a quiet musicality bring the novel's eerie mystery to life.</p>

      <p>Somé was abducted as a child by Jesuits, and in this memoir he gives us the story of his return to his village in Burkina Faso as an adult, and the spiritual journey of his return to himself. This is a gorgeous, deeply necessary book.</p>
