      <p>DHAKA — At least seven people were killed and eight injured on Sunday after a gas pipeline exploded in the Bangladeshi port city of Chittagong, a police official said.</p>
      <p>The pipeline exploded in front of a five-story building, blowing some of the building’s walls off, Mohammad Mohsin said, citing witnesses.</p>
      <p>The injured were taken to hospital, he said, adding the death toll could rise as some were in critical condition.</p>
      <p>Among the injured, one suffered burns while others were wounded by the wall collapse, Mohsin said.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear what caused the explosion, fire service official Amir Hossain said, adding an investigation was under way.</p>
      <p>Last month seven children died after a gas cylinder used for inflating balloons exploded in the capital Dhaka.</p>
      <p>Faulty gas pipelines and substandard cylinders often cause accidents in the south Asian country, blamed on lax monitoring.</p>
