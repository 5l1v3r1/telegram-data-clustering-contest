      <h2>The Bristol City man was handed a chance to shine in the Euro 2020 qualifier</h2>

      <p>Bristol City midfielder Joe Morrell has earned rave reviews for his performance in his competitive debut for the Wales senior side.</p>
      <p>The midfielder played a key role in Wales’ crucial 2-0 victory over Azerbaijan on Saturday thanks to goals from Kieffer Moore and Harry Wilson.</p>
      <p>Morrell – who is on a season-long loan at League One side Lincoln City – was a surprise starter for Euro 2020 qualifier which the Welsh had to win as they chase automatic qualification to next summer’s tournament.</p>
      <p>Morrell replaced the suspended Joe Allen in midfield while Juventus’s Aaron Ramsey had to settle for a place on the bench, having recently recovered from injury.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old repaid manager Ryan Giggs’ faith with an impressive display in Wales’ victory.</p>

      <p>Morrell was given a rating of 8/10 and named Star Man by <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wales-azerbaijan-euro-2020-bale-17268634">Wales Online</a>’s Ian Mitchelmore, who wrote: “Fine effort from distance early on and looked slick in possession throughout. Performed very well in the absence of Joe Allen. Booked late on, but it was a top display from the central midfielder.”</p>
      <p>The Press Association’s Jack Davies also gave Morrell 8/10.</p>
      <p>He wrote: “Picked unexpectedly at the expense of Aaron Ramsey but won the corner that led to the opening goal and was also involved in the build-up to Wales' second. Hardly put a foot wrong.”</p>
      <p>Teammate and Wales talisman Gareth Bale was given 7/10 by both.</p>
      <p>With Slovakia losing 3-1 in Croatia, Wales know victory against Bristol City team mate Adam Nagy's Hungary in Cardiff on Tuesday will seal a top two place in Group E and automatic qualification to the European Championships, which will be held across 12 stadiums around the continent, including Wembley.</p>
