      <p>If you were one of those who booed Joe Gomez at Wembley on Thursday, you need to have a serious word with yourself.</p>
      <p>Some fans just can’t distinguish between right and wrong, and for Gomez to be turned on when we all know he was the victim rather than the aggressor in Monday’s clash with Raheem Sterling was disgraceful.</p>
      <p>It took me back to 2011, when Patrice Evra was booed by some ­supporters after being racially abused by Luis Suarez.</p>
      <p>It was utterly ridiculous and I hope at least some of those who jeered him have regretted doing so.</p>
      <p>Sterling bowled into the England camp at the start of the week thinking his status as the best player in the land gave him a free pass to behave as he did – and it doesn’t.</p>

      <p>So Gareth Southgate got the call to drop him spot on and, in making that decision, he showed another layer of strength in his managerial acumen.</p>
      <p>The message for the rest of the group was that no one – no matter how talented they are – is more ­important than the team.</p>
      <p>And hopefully that will resonate with players such as Callum Hudson-Odoi, who said Sterling was his “idol” in an interview in the days that followed.</p>
      <p>The warning from Southgate was simple – it said, “Even idols will be brought to heel”.</p>
      <p>I know from personal experience that Sterling won’t have enjoyed being in that dressing room on Thursday.</p>

      <p>I was in the Stadio Olimpico in Rome when we qualified for France ’98 and, trust me, when everyone is whooping and enjoying the moment, if you are involved in the match then you don’t feel the same way.</p>
      <p>Sterling is used to being one of the main men – if not the main man – with England and he will have missed that feeling.</p>
      <p>So, hopefully, it’s a lesson learned and we can all move on when he ­returns against Kosovo on Sunday.</p>
      <p>As for Montenegro, they were ­disappointing and the game left me feeling that we still desperately need a player who can run with the ball from the halfway line to the edge of the opponents’ box next summer.</p>

      <p>I know that sort of player doesn’t grow on trees, but it’s what we’re ­crying out for. James Maddison is a passer, Harry Winks a fire-starter with his little passes, Mason Mount arrives in the area, Sterling plays too high up for this to be his job and it just isn’t Jordan Henderson’s game.</p>
      <p>The one man who can do it is Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.</p>
      <p>Now, I’m not comparing him to Gazza, but what I am saying is that he gave us a taster last week of his ability to run with the ball and commit midfielders and defenders – and that’s not something any England player has done well for a long time.</p>
      <p>Maddison and Mount do it from time to time, but not in the same way as the Ox, who can run past players at pace, draw three or four to him to like moths to a flame, and then pop the ball off.</p>
      <p>He can do something special. Jack Grealish has it in the locker as well, albeit in slower motion, but Oxlade-Chamberlain is ahead of him in the pecking order as things stand.</p>
      <p>My one concern about the Liverpool player is that he’s very one-footed, but what he will do in tight games is get shots off from ­distance and that can cause ­problems and open ­up ­opposition defences.</p>
      <p>The fact is, if we go the distance next summer, the ­majority of our games will be in the British Isles. So we will want to play on the front foot and get at people.</p>
      <p>That’s why I’ll be closely watching the Ox over the next few months – ­because he can show just how good he is at that.</p>
      <p>I won’t say he’s a shoo-in to start for England, but he’s ­certainly a shoo-in for the squad, if fit.</p>
      <p>He can offer ­alternatives and, more ­importantly, he’s a player who can get people out of their seats.</p>
