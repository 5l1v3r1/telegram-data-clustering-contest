      <p>Number one spot in the ICC Test rankings for bowlers does not change what he tries to do on the field, said the Australian right-arm pacer Pat Cummins.</p>
      <p>The right-arm pacer retained his top spot in the rankings which were released on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“The last six or seven years, Dale Steyn’s been number one, and for me he’s been the guy I’ve put up on a pedestal and thought, ‘How good is he?’ To think I’m number one now is really weird. It doesn’t change what I’m trying to do out on the field or who I am, but it’s a nice little nod to have,” Cummins was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old bowler, who will be spearheading Australia’s pace-bowling attack in the upcoming Test series against Pakistan, also said that he satisfied with his accuracy in the bowling.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been really happy with my accuracy. I feel like the more I’ve bowled, the more accurate I’ve become,” he said.</p>
      <p>“When I almost don’t have to think, ‘Is this ball going to land where I want it to?’ it gives me time to consider other options – just knowing that your stock ball is in a good place,” added Cummins.</p>
