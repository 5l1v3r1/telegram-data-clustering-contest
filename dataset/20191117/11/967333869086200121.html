      <p>Saudi Arabia's state oil company Saudi Aramco announced on Sunday that it <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911021077205184-saudi-crown-prince-approves-ipo-aramco-sunday/">plans</a> to sell 1.5 percent of its company shares on the local Saudi stock exchange, the Tadawul, for the price of $8-$8.5 per share. The final share price will be announced on 5 December.</p>
      <blockquote>"The offer stands at 1.5% of all available shares of the company," the materials said. "This corresponds to 3 billion shares of the company. The basic range of the offering price will be 30-32 riyals per share (approximately 8.1-8.6 dollars per share)."</blockquote>
      <p>Thus, the basic cost of the entire placement package is about 24.3-25.9 billion dollars, and the market capitalisation of the entire company is 1.6-1.7 trillion dollars.</p>
      <p>According to the material, Saudi Arabia lowered the assessment of the total cost of Aramco. When it initially announced plans to conduct a company IPO, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, predicted that the cost of a 5% stake would be $ 100 billion. Accordingly, during the placement, the entire company could have been valued at about $ 2 trillion.</p>
