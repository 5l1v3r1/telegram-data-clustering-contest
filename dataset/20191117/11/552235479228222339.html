      <p>Hibs and St Johnstone are reportedly set to 'fight it out' for the signature of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/efe-ambrose">Efe Ambrose</a> .</p>
      <p>The former Easter Road and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> defender is a free agent since leaving Derby County at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>And the Daily Mail claim <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> ' side are hoping to bring the defender back to Leith, but face stiff competition from the Saints.</p>
      <p>Ambrose left <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> in January after two years at the club but didn't play for the Rams during his six-month spell.</p>

      <p>Both teams have been poor defensively this season and are in need of reinforcements at the back. St Johnstone have conceded a league high 28 goals from 12 games, while Hibs have let in 23.</p>
      <p>Ross was unveiled as the new Hibs boss on Friday and will take charge of his first game at home to Motherwell on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The former St Mirren gaffer could dip into the transfer market in January as he looks to take Hibs back up the table.</p>
