      <h2>Virat Kohli took some time out to greet and offer an autograph to a fan after wrapping up the first Test against Bangladesh with an innings win inside three days in Indore on Saturday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:27:09+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/sports-desk/" target="_blank">Sports Desk</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/virat-kohli/">Virat Kohli</a> became the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/virat-kohli-1st-india-captain-10-innings-wins-india-vs-bangladesh-stats-6122879/">first Indian captain with ten innings wins</a> in Test cricket after defeating Bangladesh by an innings and 130 runs at Holkar International Stadium on Saturday. Instead of revelling in his glory, the skipper took some time out after the match to interact with a fan in Indore.</p>
      <p>Along with his leadership skills on the field, the 32-year-old’s heartwarming gesture awed fans which showed how down-to-earth he is. In the video, Kohli stopped by a fan with a disability, named <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/pooja-sharma">Pooja Sharma</a>, greeted her and signed an autograph.</p>

      <p>His compassion and respect towards his fans is nothing new, with Kohli also taking some time out of his schedule to meet Odisha’s Pintu Behera last month during the first Test against South Africa in <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/visakhapatnam-lok-sabha-election-results/">Visakhapatnam</a>. Behera had 16 tattoos on his body dedicated to the talismanic Indian captain.</p>
      <p>Previously, during the World Cup, Kohli along with vice-captain, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rohit-sharma/">Rohit Sharma</a>, had greeted a vuvuzela-blowing 87-year-old Indian fan after their clash against Bangladesh in July. He had even tweeted about Charulata Patel from his Twitter account.</p>

      <p>After wrapping up the first Test against Bangladesh with much conviction inside three days, Kohli will look to extend India’s six-match winning run in the ICC World Test Championship. He would also hope to add runs to his tally in the ongoing series, after getting dismissed on a second-ball duck by Bangladesh’s Abu Jayed.</p>
      <p>India will now host Bangladesh for their first-ever day-night Test which is scheduled to be played at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata with a pink ball, starting November 22.</p>
