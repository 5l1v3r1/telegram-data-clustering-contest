      <p>The Filipina lawyer and beauty queen said her main goal was "to deliver an excellent speech upon reaching the Top 8."</p>
      <p>"That’s not to say that I didn’t aim to win, but I say that because I was never one to dwell on things outside my control," she continued.</p>
      <p>Patch said she knew when she delivered her speech she already done everything within her power, "and it would be up to fate or luck whether or not I would get the crown."</p>
      <p>The Philippine bet said as she stood with her fellow candidates she felt ready to accept whatever would be given to her.</p>
      <p>"Standing there with seven equally deserving ladies, I surrendered everything and I was ready to accept whatever placement would be given to me," she added.</p>
      <p>She thanked Miss International for giving her the opportunity to speak her definition of their slogan #CheerAllWomen.</p>
      <p>"I’m so grateful to have had the chance to speak about my truth, and the truth of all women who have had limitations placed on them based on their gender. It’s not everyday you are given a huge platform to speak about something you care deeply about! To @missinternationalofficial, thank you!?????"</p>
      <p>Patch expressed how honored she feels to represent the Philippines, thanking her supporters for believing in her.</p>
      <p>"?????To my country, and to everyone who believed in me, thank you from the bottom of my heart! Your support is a prize on its own! To be a Miss Philippines has been the greatest experience of my life, thank you for letting me represent you! Domo arigatou gozaimasu!"?????</p>
      <p>Patch's full speech:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>When I was younger, I found it strange that I was subjected to different standards as other boys my age. When I got older and even more so when I became a lawyer I began to question these standards and challenge them.<br/><br/>Why should women live in fear and harassment, violence and discrimination when basic human decency calls for respect, tolerance and compassion. To cheer all women means to support all women. Regardless of race, religion and background but not only this.<br/><br/>It also means to remove the barriers to prevent women from realizing their full potential. Miss International does this by fostering a culture of women empowerment and gender equality and through this platform we can ensure that no woman anytime anywhere is left behind.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Patch finished her Miss International 2019 stint as one of the Top 8 candidates, failing to take home the seventh crown of the country.</p>
