      <p>A man was abducted by an armed gang of four persons in broad daylight from a busy bus stand in Karnataka’s Raichur district on Saturday.  A day after the incident, four people were arrested from Bijapur and the man rescued. However, the motive behind the crime is yet to be ascertained.</p>
      <p>According to CCTV visuals collected from near Lingausugur bus stand, the man was dragged inside a car by two people who had approached him and were speaking to him.</p>

      <p>Raichur Superintendent of Police (SP) C B Vedamurthy told <i><a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a></i>, “From the CCTV visuals obtained from a textile shop, we were able to identify that the abductors were travelling in a Maharashtra-registered modified white car with a black roof. Two of the accused stayed inside the car while the remaining two approached the man standing on the pavement.”</p>
      <p>“As the man tried to resist the abductors and the public came to his rescue, the miscreants used a pistol and a steel rod to threaten the crowd,” Vedamurthy added.</p>
      <p>“We managed to identify the vehicle number as MH 14 BC 3566, which helped us trace its location. The victim is safe but was found to be assaulted, and is injured,” Vedamurthy said.</p>
      <p>The arrested have been identified as Chandsab, Ramesh, Miraj, Santosh and Sabir. “The accused have been arrested and a thorough interrogation is on to find out the motive behind the abduction,” a police officer said.</p>
      <p>The investigating team led by officers of the Lingasugur police station nabbed the accused after four teams were formed for search operations across neighbouring districts, the police added.</p>
      <p>Following the incident, an FIR was registered under Sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint), 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.</p>
