        <b>Chelsea midfielder Mateo Kovacic has revealed manager Frank Lampard has set him the target of scoring more goals by encouraging him to shoot more.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Croatia international is a solid performer for this Blues side but doesn’t exactly have much of a reputation for contributing huge amounts in the final third of the pitch.</p>

      <p>Chelsea fans probably won’t be too bothered as long as Kovacic continues to do his job in midfield, but goals from that area are always a nice bonus.</p>
      <p>Current CFC manager Lampard is of course well known for being one of the finest goal-scoring midfield players of recent times, so there should be an opportunity there for Kovacic to learn good habits from his coach.</p>
      <p>Speaking about this issue in an interview with Chelsea’s <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2019/11/16/kovacic-exclusive-part-one--on-finding-top-form--playing-with-jo">official site</a>, Kovacic admitted this something that Lampard has said he wants the 25-year-old to add to his game.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if it will work, but Blues fans can be pleased at Lampard’s desire for perfectionism from everyone in his squad.</p>
      <p>He said: “I never had the pressure to score goals, I was never obsessed because my game is not about goals, but obviously if I want to go to the next step I need to improve it.</p>
      <p>“The coach was the greatest goal-scoring midfielder that ever played. There were many, but he really scored a lot of goals. He tells me always that I need to shoot. Now I am trying more!</p>
      <p>“It’s just a thing of mentality, to try to score, to be aggressive and to have the hunger to score goals. I want to improve that, I’m trying to improve that and I am sure I will get there.”</p>
