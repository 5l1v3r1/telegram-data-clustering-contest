      <h1>Infinix to Launch Infinity O-Display Infinix S5 in Uganda</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:37:51+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:37</time> by <a rel="author">John Ivan Kisekka</a></address>
      <p>Infinix Mobility is set to launch the very first phone model with an Infinity O-Display in Uganda. Dubbed the Infinix S5, it is scheduled to launch on Wednesday 20th November 2019 with high hopes to tap into the young and hip crowd due to its fresh look and affordable price.</p>
      <p>Infinix continues to throw a number of firsts on its S series. Just a few months back, the <a href="https://www.dignited.com/30092/infinix-hot-s3-review/">Infinix S3</a> was the first Infinix device to use a Snapdragon processor. <a href="https://www.dignited.com/47019/infinix-s4-review-selfie-employed-smartphone/">The S4</a> followed as the company’s first device with a waterdrop notch.</p>
      <p>The Infinix “S” series has a well-documented history for front camera prowess. From the first “S” series in 2016, all the recent models have proved Infinix’s dedication to keeping up with the latest trends in the smartphone industry.</p>
      <h3>Infinix S5: Expected Features</h3>
      <p>As the <a href="https://www.dignited.com/54528/infinix-s5-s5-lite-specs-price-in-nigeria/">case was in Nigeria</a>, the Infinix s5 will come in two major versions, S5 (64GB ROM/4GB RAM) and S5 Lite (32GB ROM &amp;3GB RAM).</p>
      <p>The S5 depicts Infinix’s <a href="https://www.dignited.com/43019/punch-hole-dual-screens-and-pop-up-camera-the-state-of-anti-notch-technologies-in-2019/">anti-notch struggle</a>. It sports a 6.6-inch screen designed to leave more real estate for an immersive experience. It houses a front camera at the upper left corner to make it easier to take selfies.</p>

      <p>The Infinix S5 will have a Quad Camera setup at the back, taking mobile photography to a whole new level in just a click even in the dark.</p>
      <p>The device will be powered by a 4000mAh battery that can last 2 days for an average user. The battery will also support 2A fast charging technology for a quick refill.</p>
      <h3>Infinix S5 Price in Uganda</h3>
      <p>The Infinix S5 is anticipated to be between UGX 600,000/= to UGX 700,000/=. The Lite model will obviously be cheaper and we believe it will be the most common model because of its low price.</p>
      <p>We shall confirm price, available color options, and other key specifications when the device launches. Leave a comment below and let us know what you would love to see in the Infinix S5 when it launched in Uganda.</p>
