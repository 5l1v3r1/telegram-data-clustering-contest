      <p>Carol Vorderman took her so-called ‘bitable bum’ out in the sunshine over the weekend. Fact.</p>
      <p>Taking in the rays in Cardiff, it’s become abundantly clear that be it summer or winter, Vorders is not about to give up her famous skinny jeans without a fight.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old has seemingly declared them a wardrobe staple as she donned them on many on occasion, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/13/carol-vorderman-dons-favourite-skin-tight-jeans-with-welsh-flag-as-she-loves-life-at-rugby-world-cup-10910370/">to the rugby</a>, to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/15/carol-vorderman-feeling-leather-trousers-shows-off-new-hair-10574384/">the hair salon</a> – now she’s wearing them to the local BBC studios in Wales.</p>
      <p>Stepping out on Saturday in what can only be described as pretty frigid Welsh temperatures, Carol donned a wool sweater with her trousers, as she added a pair of black boots and toted a puffer jacket just in case things get a little chilly.</p>
      <p>With the sun shining on her face, though, it looked like a blissful November day in the city as she headed to the radio studios looking incredible.</p>

      <p>The Pride Of Britain host wore a pair of sunglasses as she headed out with what Amanda Holden brilliantly <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/05/amanda-holden-reckons-carol-vorderman-bum-can-really-bite-10866168/">described recently as a ‘bum you can bite’.</a></p>

      <p>Vorders has become somewhat of an icon for her curves as of late, opening up on the mayhem surrounding her behind.</p>
      <p>Keeping fit by trekking for 15 miles twice a week, she insisted she has never had bottom implants.</p>

      <p>She told Mailonline: ‘I’ve always had a huge a**e. I promise I haven’t had bottom implants. It’s the same old bottom.’</p>
      <p>‘In my family, loads of us have it: the Vorderman A**e. My daughter Katie has it. My nephew has it. We’re all sticky-out-bottom people.</p>

      <p>‘And I’ve been working out for decades, so the shape of mine is down to years of keeping fit.’</p>
      <p>Her title in the Rear Of The Year awards was recently stolen by Amanda, though, with the radio presenter dumbfounded she beat THE Vorderman, who took the crown in 2011 and again in 2014.</p>
      <p>‘Yes — gosh — I beat Carol Vorderman. She’s won it quite a lot. She’s got a bum you can really bite,’ Amanda said.</p>
      <p>‘And there is a physical award. My husband is thrilled!’</p>
