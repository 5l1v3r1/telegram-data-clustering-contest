            <u>The newly crowned Olowo of Owo, Oba Gbadegesin  Ajibade Ogunoye III was the cynosure of all eyes recently, as he led his chiefs and subjects in the annual Ogogo festival – his first as Oba. Taiwo Abiodun reports that the new Olowo stole the show with his age-long Seseki royal regalia, worn by his father half a century ago.</u>

      <p>Shouts of Oologho, Baabaa oo!!! rent the air as the new Olowo of Owo, Oba Gbadegesin Ajibade Ogunoye III emerged for the this year’s Igogo festival in his beaded Seseki royal regalia, said to have been worn by his late father, a former Olowo of Owo, during his reign over 50 years ago.</p>
      <p>Attached to the Seseki was the celebrated uda igha (Olowo sword), and four beautiful urere oken (peacock feathers) tucked on his head, and beautiful coral beads adorning his wrists and ankles, tall Oba Ogunoye clearly looked the part.</p>
      <p>In his hand was a golden native gong, held loosely by a mysterious asighere chain. Once in a while, he clanged the gong, led a song, while his chiefs and subjects responded in frenzied chorus.</p>
      <p>Commenting on his costume, Oba Ogunoye said, “The Seseki I’m wearing is my father’s costume. It has been there over 50 years, and (as you can see) has neither worn out nor tore. Moreover, it can only be lifted by two hefty men, for it is mystical. My uda igha is different from the Udamaloore, but this is also from my father’s archive, same with the asighere chain.”</p>
      <p>In line with Igogo tradition, the Oba and his chiefs plaited their hair and dressed like a woman, as they danced round the town.</p>
      <p>“This is indeed a massive crowd. It has never been like this before. It is the dawn of a new era in Owo Kingdom because the song on everybody’s lips is love and unity,” Honourable Muritala Ahmed, a prominent son of Owo attested to The Nation.</p>
      <p>Present despite her age was 98-year-old Chief Fehintola Famulagun, the Obajereuwa of Owo Kingdom, who literally ‘dragged’ herself to the palace, using an old wagon wheel cart called Okuukuu in Owo dialect.</p>
      <p>Her daughter, Mrs Lanrewaju Adegoke-Adele said, “My mother is 98 years old and it has been 18 years since she broke her leg and has not come out to celebrate but she decided to come out today not only to participate but to pray for the new king.”</p>
      <p>Ogwamodu of Owo, Chief Tola Ogwatoghose, described the festival as a huge success, praising the monarch for his love for the town.</p>
      <p>“They observed Oluwere which is meant for the women who would start their Igogo for five days after Olowo’s Igogo. I am happy to have witnessed it. It was done at Ugha Eduma. For the past 20 years, it was not done. That is where they start Igogo and Upeli,” the excited chief said.</p>
      <p>Significantly, the Ojomo Oluda of Ijebu-Owo, Oba Kofoworola Oladoyinbo was at the Olowo palace to celebrate with his brother, Olowo, as custom demands, for the first time in six years.</p>
      <p>Tunde Onibode, a native, who has covered the festival for years, observed: “The last time the Ojomo-Oluda danced to the palace of Olowo during Igogo festival was September 11 2013, which the former Olowo Oba Olateru Olagbegi reciprocated by going to his palace the following day.</p>
      <p>Matthew Obajuluwa, the Chief Hunter of Ijebu -Owo described this year’s festival as super. He said the hunters were in a joyous mood, as evident in their bringing bush meat gifts to the King.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Not a fetish festival</b>
      </p>
      <p>High Chief Ilori Tunde, who is the Elerewe of Owo, who actively participated in the festival alongside fellow chiefs like Ojumu, Akowa, Osuporu said “Igogo is our own festival and it is unique. I killed a cow to celebrate it. I am happy that we are alive to participate in the age-long festival. We exchanged gifts, danced round the town, visiting families and friends.”</p>
      <p>He argued that “there is nothing like human sacrifice in it, as Christians and Muslims participate in it.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Olowo Ojomo miracle</b>
      </p>
      <p>A significant outcome of the festival was the story of how the Oba’s prayer miraculously revived the fortune of the ancient Ojomo market.</p>
      <p>When the King and his entourage got to the once popular Ojomo market in the town, the market women pleaded with him to pray for the market to regain its lost glory. According to Jide Tububo, “The Monarch poured libation and prayed for the market to revive and bounce back while thunderous Ase (Amen) followed. Three days after, the market began to fill up again.”</p>
      <p>A source revealed that the market had been cursed by the late Oba Adekola Ogunoye II, who was insulted and denied observing his rites while performing Igogo festival several years back.</p>
      <p>“Now for the past one week the market is coming back,” Tububo said.</p>
