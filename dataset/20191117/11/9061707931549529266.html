      <h1>'Fire' - Former Derby County striker delivers verdict on Rams under Phillip Cocu</h1>
      <h2>'I can see positive signs and now it’s about getting the positive results on the road that we’ve seen at Pride Park'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:29:15+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:29</time> by <a rel="author">James Pallatt</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> are making progress under new manager <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/phillip-cocu">Phillip Cocu</a>, says former Rams striker Kevin Wilson.</p>
      <p>Derby are currently down in 16th place in the Championship, having won five, lost five and drawn six of Cocu's first 16 league matches in charge at Pride Park.</p>
      <p>They have produced some good performances on home soil, winning their last four Championship matches in front of their own fans, but Cocu's side have so far struggled away.</p>
      <p>They have only won once on the road - in their opening match of the season at Huddersfield - and have lost their last three away matches, the latest setback coming against arch-rivals Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>While having to try to solve his side's inconsistent form, Cocu has also been forced to contend with the club's off-field problems, involving players <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/richard-keogh">Richard Keogh</a>, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/tom-lawrence">Tom Lawrence</a> and Mason Bennett.</p>
      <p>“I do see progress and to be honest it has been a baptism of fire for the manager, on and off the field,” Wilson told RamsTV.</p>
      <p>“I believe he comes across well in the press and it’s clear to see that he is definitely a thinker.</p>
      <p>"He doesn’t put anything controversial out there and he knows what he does need to say and put out.</p>

      <p>“It hasn’t been easy for him, of course. He came in late in the summer and had to make some changes and go straight into pre-season.</p>
      <p>“As we’ve said before, he lost around 30 goals in the summer with Harry Wilson and Mason Mount going back to their parent clubs after impressive loan spells. It wasn’t going to be easy.”</p>
      <p>“I can see positive signs and now it’s about getting the positive results on the road that we’ve seen at Pride Park. We need to keep going, believe in what we’re doing and I am sure the team will climb the table," added Wilson.</p>
      <p>“We need to focus on the positives away from home and especially in the last few games, obviously now it’s about getting the ball in the back of the net which will make a huge difference. I think when it comes together there will be a lot of confidence spreading through the side.”</p>
