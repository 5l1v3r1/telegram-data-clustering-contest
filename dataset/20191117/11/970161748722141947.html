      <p>To celebrate the Boots meal deal’s 20th birthday, you can get one for £1.99 this week.</p>
      <p>Yes, Boots has been offering the main, snack and drink deal for over two decades.</p>
      <p>Normally, £3.39 outside London and £3.99 in the capital and at airports, the deal is a good saving.</p>
      <p>However, it does come with some small print – you have to spend £5 in store to get the offer.</p>
      <p>But it might be worth picking up some shampoo or toothpaste that you will use any way to get the offer.</p>
      <p>The deal will be £1.99 in England and Wales. Scottish and Northern Irish customers will have a separate deal, where you can scan you advantage card to get a £2.50 deal, with no spend required.</p>
      <p>The offer includes their Christmas sandwiches including a traditional turkey feast, a vegan option and pigs under blankets – cocktail sausages and bacon between two slices of bread.</p>

      <p>There’s also a handcrafted chocolate log available as a snack in the deal.</p>
      <p>The offer runs until 25 November and you can read the full terms and conditions in store.</p>
      <p>Fans of the deal were excited by the offer.</p>
      <p>Lucy said: ‘That’s fantastic, perfect for a treat lunch and spoiling my kids too.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, others were just shocked to discover the meal deal has been around for so long.</p>
      <p>One person said: ‘I remember the launch so well….. you did a radio campaign in Leicester that went badly. As an apology your company gave our company about 200 free sandwich vouchers. Those sandwiches were awesome and not just because they were free!’</p>
      <p>Danielle added: ‘Wow the meal deal has been going 20years? Now I feel old.’</p>
