      <h2>Culture Minister decries possibility of minority left-wing government formed with outside Arab support.</h2>

      <p>Culture and Sports Minister Miri Regev expressed dismay at the possibility of the formation of a minority left-wing government without outside support form the Arab parties.</p>
      <p>"I am very upset and troubled for the people of Israel by the fact that three chiefs of staff and two defense ministers are selling the state for terror supporters and terrorists such as Ahmad Tibi and Ayman Odeh," said Regev.</p>
      <p>"Once they decided to go to a minority government, they spit on the bereaved families, spit on the IDF soldiers, and IDF commanders. I remind them that Ahmad Tibi and Ayman Odeh once called former IDF Chiefs of Staff war criminals and today also call IDF soldiers war criminals," she added.</p>
      <p>Regev said later that she did not see a problem with the prime minister's briefing talks with Likud MKs during Shabbat.</p>
      <p>"Anyone who observes Shabbat does not take part in these talks," Minister Regev clarified following the allegations made last night that the prime minister conducted political activity on Shabbat.</p>
      <p>"We maintain tradition, believe in the Holy One, Blessed Be He, I at least believe.</p>
      <p>"We value our haredi partners so we go together in one block, the block of 55 [right-wing and haredi MKs]," the Minister of Culture added.</p>
