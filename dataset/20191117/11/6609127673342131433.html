        <b>THE heartbroken mum of a Celtic fan found dead in marshlands is set to appear on James English's podcast in her bid for answers about his death.</b>
      </p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4869942/rhys-bonner-glasgow-dead-woman/">Hoops-daft lad</a>, 19, disappeared as he headed to meet a pal near his home in Barlanark, Glasgow, on July 24.</p>
      <p>He was found a fortnight later a mile away in a bog at Seven Lochs Wetland Park.</p>
      <p>In her latest social media appeal for information, Stephanie urged drivers to check dashcam footage for any clues.</p>
      <p>She said: "Anyone that was at Easterhouse on July 24, could you please check your dashcam in your cars.</p>
      <p>"You never know, you could have come across something.</p>
      <p>"He was with an older woman, could have been more people with them."</p>

      <p>Rhys was last captured on CCTV at the shops on Conisborough Road, Easterhouse,  walking down Gardyne Street at 7.45pm.</p>
      <p>When he vanished, he was wearing a long sleeved Celtic top, grey North Face hat, black Adidas trainers and dark trousers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4447584/james-english-documentary-iraq-los-angeles/">Glasgow podcast star James</a> is now hoping to get his listeners on board with Stephanie's appeal.</p>
      <p>Confirming his upcoming guest, he said: "I reached out to Rhys's mum Stephanie and spoke with her on the phone.</p>

      <p>"She’s such a strong women and I told her I would have her on my show no problem.</p>
      <p>"I want to help her get more exposure and hopefully get some answers."</p>
      <p>We told earlier how Stephanie mounted her own probe after being told her son was last seen with a woman in her 40s.</p>
      <p>Police scoured CCTV and found footage of the pair.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-five Stephanie said: “I knew then something had happened to him. Rhys was half-naked when they found him.</p>
      <p>“Why was he lying like that? This woman has never approached me to tell me why he was with her, where he went or what could have happened.”</p>
