        <b>A BOTTLE of Sainsbury’s own-brand squash was spotted somewhere unusual by one shopper - on the shelves in Tesco.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The bottle and contents of the Sainsbury’s squash look almost identical to the Tesco own-brand version, with the only difference being the labels for two entirely different supermarkets.</p>

      <p>This gaffe was spotted by Demi Boonham from Lichfield, who posted a snap in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ReduceYourSupermarketSpend/">Reduce Your Supermarket Spend Facebook group</a> with the caption “spot the error”.<br/>In the photo, a single summer fruits squash with a Sainsbury’s label can be seen among several others with Tesco labels.</p>
      <p>Many users speculated that the mistake showed that both stores were stocking the exact same product, with the manufacturer simply changing the label.</p>
      <p>One commenter said: “Just goes to show that some brands are actually the same.”</p>
      <p>In fact, near identical bottles of this squash are available in Asda, Morrisons, Tesco, Sainsburys and Co Op.</p>

      <p>As well as looking similar, the products also have near-identical ingredient lists and nutritional information.</p>
      <p>It is not clear how the Sainsbury’s own brand product came to be on the shelves at Tesco.</p>
      <p>Some commenters also shared their experiences of finding own-brand products in the wrong supermarket.</p>
      <p>One user wrote: “I got broccoli with a Sainsbury’s label on in Tesco the other day and the cashier thought I'd planted it.”</p>
      <p>Another said: “I bought Sainsbury's milk in Aldi once before.”</p>
      <p>And, it seems supermarkets make the error with home deliveries also, one person said: “I got Morrison’s gluten free sausages in my Tesco delivery once.”</p>
      <p>We have contacted both Tesco and Sainsbury’s for comment and will update this story when we get a response.</p>
      <p>Own-brand may be cheaper, but a Sun Money investigation found that supermarket beans have 50 per cent less beans than named brands.</p>
      <p>But, this £12 bottle of Champagne from Lidl was named by experts as on par with fancy brands like Veuve Clicquot.</p>
      <p>If you find a Rudolph sweet in your Percy Pigs from M&amp;S you could win £50.</p>
