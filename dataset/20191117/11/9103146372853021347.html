        <b>Cameroon were awarded the rights to host the 2021 AFCON as a recompense for being stripped of the 2019 edition, which they were originally supposed to host. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Ivory Coast had actually won the bidding process for the 2021 tournament but once CAF president Ahmad Ahmad transferred the rights to Cameroon, the former were given the 2023 rights, with Guinea, originally set to host the 2023 event, moved to 2025. </p>
      <p>The 2021 edition will run from 11 – 19 July and be played at six different venues across five cities.</p>
      <p>Cameroon boasts five Afcon titles but this only the second time they are hosting the tournament, with the 1972 edition having also been played in the West African nation.</p>
      <p>Cranes hope to seal a third consecutive Nations Cup appearance in Cameroon. To achieve that, Uganda, who drew with Burkina Faso in their first Nations Cup qualifier in Ouagadougou, must beat Malawi on Sunday preserve their qualification prospects.</p>
