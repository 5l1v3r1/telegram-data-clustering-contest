      <p>The renewables investment arm of Octopus Group will list a new trust next month, which will buy and operate renewable energy infrastructure assets such as wind farms and solar panels.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Times reported that the Octopus Renewables Infrastructure Trust is seeking to raise about £250m in December’s float, and has forecast a three per cent return for the first year of trading, which will rise to seven to eight per cent thereafter.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The move comes as more and more firms invest in renewable energy sources over growing environmental concerns.</p>
      <p>According to the Association of Investment Companies, a record £1.1bn was raised for renewable energy and infrastructure trusts in the first six months of this year.</p>
      <p>Such investments are becoming increasingly appealing, with shares in renewables trusts tend to trade about 14 per cent higher than their net asset value. </p>
      <p>Matt Setchell, co-head of Octopus Renewables, said: “This will bring direct access to renewable assets for investors.”</p>
      <p>On Friday the company announced a deal with global energy supplier Res to purchase nine wind farms across the UK, Ireland, and France for more than €100 million (£86m).</p>
      <p>The facilities have a total capacity of 130 megawatts and will take Octopus’ total onshore wind portfolio to 470 megawatts over 21 sites.</p>
      <p>Alex Brierley, investment director at Octopus Renewables, said: “This is a further stride for Octopus into the European wind market, mirroring our strength in solar. </p>
      <p>“With these assets, we’ve significantly expanded our onshore wind footprint in France, which continues to be highly attractive as a destination for investment in renewable energy.”</p>
      <p>The investment group also owns a household supply subsidiary, Octopus Energy, which last week launched a joint venture with Midcounties Cooperative to support community generation projects across the country.</p>

      <p>Co-op Community Energy has already secured five new Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with hydro-electric sites operated by the National Trust across Wales. </p>
      <p>The new agreements take the number of sites supplying renewable energy to Co-op Energy customers to 79.</p>
