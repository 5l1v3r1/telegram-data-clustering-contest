      <h3>FOUR men who reportedly attempted to leave the country to illegally work in Libya were barred by immigration authorities at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 1.</h3>
      <p>Bureau of Immigration (BI) port operations division chief Grifton Medina said the four men were intercepted at the departure area of the NAIA 1 terminal last Friday after attempting to board their flight to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>
      <p>Medina said the return tickets presented by the four passengers are not valid, thus reinforcing suspicion that they are not tourists and whose real purpose in leaving is to work abroad.      </p>
      <p>In addition, Medina said the four admitted during questioning that they would go to Libya where high paying jobs await them because of their technical expertise.</p>
      <p>In her report, Travel Control and Enforcement Unit (TCEU) Chief Timotea Barizo said the four pretended to be tourists bound for the UAE, and planned to proceed to Amman, Jordan before proceeding to their final destination in Libya where they were hired to work as aircon technicians and pipe fitters.</p>
      <p>‘They said they were recruited to work in Libya despite the deployment ban at the initiative of their friends and relatives who are already working there,’ Barizo added.</p>
      <p>The BI is doubly strict in enforcing the ban on the deployment of overseas workers to Libya where a civil war has been raging among groups that want to wrest control of the government.</p>
