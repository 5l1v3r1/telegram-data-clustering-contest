      <h1>The Arsenal, Liverpool and Peterborough United strikers linked with Bristol City moves ahead of the January transfer window</h1>
      <h2>An Arsenal striker and Liverpool forward are among the names to have been mentioned</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Max Baker</a></address>
      <p>The January transfer window is fast approaching and it's fair to say Bristol City fans are desperate for attacking options at the club to be bolstered.</p>
      <p>Supporters thought their prayers were answered when the Robins signed Benik Afobe on loan from Stoke in the summer. However, disaster struck in September after an ACL injury ruled the DR Congo striker out at least March.</p>
      <p>Lee Johnson has already hinted at activity, as <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-verdict-brownhill-brilliant-3523121">following the 1-0 win at Cardiff</a> on Sunday, he said: "You’ve got the January window to negotiate, both in terms of not losing anyone but also adding, even if it’s just one, maybe two, to give you that bit of spark."</p>
      <p>We've put together a list of players City have previously been linked with by national media between the summer window closing and now, ahead of January 1, in just seven weeks time.</p>
      <h3>Eddie Nketiah</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Reported by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10122362/arsenal-nketiah-bristol-city-leeds/">The Sun on October 12</a> and <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1313667/2019/10/23/bristol-city-read-to-step-in-as-leeds-fans-and-arsenal-watch-bielsa-ration-nketiahs-chances/">The Athletic on October 22</a></i>
      </p>
      <p>The Arsenal youngster came extremely close to signing for the Robins until Leeds swooped in at the eleventh hour.</p>
      <p>Since then Nketiah has found his playing time limited with just 265 Championship minutes under his belt, and has just picked up an abdomen injury which could leave him out of action for at least two weeks.</p>
      <p>There was talk that he could be recalled by Arsenal and a move back to City could be back on the cards, however <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/players/eddie-nketiahs-loan-status-leeds-17218200">Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa says the choice will be down to Nketiah.</a></p>
      <p>After the recent injury, it's looking more and more unlikely that he could make a move to BS3 in the January window.</p>

      <h3>Ivan Toney</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Reported by <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/exclusive-middlesbrough-derby-chasing-20m-peterborough-pair">Teamtalk on September 23</a></i>
      </p>
      <p>Peterborough's frontline has lit up League One this season, and City have been linked with two the three men up top.</p>
      <p>Ivan Toney has bagged 12 goals and two assists this season, finding himself joint top of the scoring charts next to former City man Mohamed Eisa.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old was linked with a January move <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-derby-county-middlesbrough-3357574">in September</a>, with the likes of Derby County and Middlesbrough also interested after his flying start to the campaign.</p>
      <p>However, a £10m asking price was slapped on Toney, and with the striker showing no signs of slowing down, that could have increased in the past two months.</p>
      <p>It's clear that Toney has quality, but it would be a risk for City to spend the big bucks on a player who has not yet proven himself in the Championship.</p>
      <h3>Marcus Maddison</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Reported by <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/exclusive-middlesbrough-derby-chasing-20m-peterborough-pair">Teamtalk on September 23</a></i>
      </p>
      <p>The other Peterborough forward City have been linked with. Maddison has also reportedly been given a £10m price tag and the same concern has to be considered here - would City break their transfer record for for a player with no Championship experience?</p>

      </figure>
      <p>There's also the thought that Maddison is not an out-and-out striker, and plays more as an attacking midfielder or winger and the Robins are well stocked in that department.</p>
      <p>Maddison is an attractive prospect, with nine goals and six assists, but it seems unlikely that City will go in for him.</p>
      <h3>Uche Ikpeazu</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Reported by <a href="https://www.westlondonsport.com/qpr/football-wls-qpr-monitoring-hearts-striker-along-with-celtic-derby-county-and-bristol-city">West London Sport on October 10</a></i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.westlondonsport.com/qpr/football-wls-qpr-monitoring-hearts-striker-along-with-celtic-derby-county-and-bristol-city">The Hearts striker was linked with City in October </a>and, at 24, is at the sort of age City will look to invest in.</p>
      <p>The forward played in the 2019 Scottish Cup final loss to Celtic, but has scored just two goals in nine games since the start of the season.</p>
      <p>Ikpeazu signed a contract extension in March so it would be unlikely that Hearts would sell him cheap, but he could be worth the investment if his goal record starts to improve.</p>
      <p>At 6ft 3", Ikpeazu is a striker of similar build to Afobe and Diedhiou and this could attract Lee Johnson if he expects to lose Afobe come the end of the season.</p>
      <h3>Rhian Brewster</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Reported by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10254258/rhian-brewster-liverpool-crystal-palace-transfer-window-loan/">The Sun on October 31</a></i>
      </p>
      <p>The Liverpool forward is certainly an attractive prospect for a six-month loan until the end of the season.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The teenager has represented the England youth squads and was on the bench for the Champions League final against Spurs and the memorable second-leg win over Barcelona.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/no-loan-what-been-said-3490679">Reports surfaced in November</a> that Brewster was attracting interest for several clubs, including Crystal Palace, Swansea and the Robins.</p>
      <p>However, Brewster himself has repeatedly said that <a href="https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/rhian-brewster-liverpool-jurgen-klopp-sadio-mane-virgil-van-dijk-tammy-abraham">Klopp does not want him to go out on loan</a> but, as we know, at Ashton Gate he will have an environment to play and develop, albeit a step down from the Premier League.</p>
      <p>There is also the experience of Ryan Kent and his <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ryan-kent-liverpool-bristol-city-1487267">hugely unsuccessful loan</a> which may count against the Robins should Brewster became a possibility in the loan market.</p>
