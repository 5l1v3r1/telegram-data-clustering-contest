      <h2>Racist Katie Hopkins moaned that speaking her mind lost her her career after she lost a £500,000 legal case to the writer Jack Monroe</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:12:02+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:12</time> by <a rel="author">Emmeline Saunders</a></address>
      <p>Katie Hopkins was forced to sell off <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/inside-katie-hopkins-five-bedroom-11879232">her £1million Devon home</a> and now rents after a humiliating court case wiped out her finances.</p>
      <p>The far-right activist, whose extreme and distasteful views saw her sacked from two lucrative newspaper columns and her LBC radio show, had to flog her family home to pay off a £500,000 legal bill after the writer Jack Monroe sued her for libel and won.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Sunday Times, racist Hopkins whinged that speaking her mind lost her her career - having compared migrants crossing the Mediterranean in dinghies to "cockroaches" and claiming she'd use gunships to prevent people from landing on European shores.</p>

      <p>"I live in a rented, modern, four-bedroom detached house with my husband Mark and our three children, aged 15, 14 and 10," she said.</p>
      <p>"It's tucked out of the way for security reasons - our last home was rigged up to the local police station and had panic alarms fitted because of threats I received to my life.</p>
      <p>"I was forced to sell it for £950,000 in early 2018 to pay off a legal bill in excess of £500,000."</p>
      <p>While she didn't apologise for the circumstances leading up to the 2017 legal case - she'd falsely accused anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe of vandalising a war memorial - Hopkins did express regret that she hadn't acted sooner to settle the case out of court.</p>

      <p>Asked what her worst business decision had been, she said: "Arguably, not settling the legal case brought against me.</p>
      <p>"I could have settled by giving £5,000 to a migrant charity but chose not to, and the ensuing court action and legal bills <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/katie-hopkins-secretly-forced-file-13254535">forced me to apply for an individual voluntary arrangement</a> ."</p>
      <p>And she claimed she learned nothing from being on The Apprentice in 2007, adding: "I 100% did not. However, I did learn that at the start of a recruitment process it's best to keep your mouth shut, listen and learn where you fit in - and only then have your say."</p>
      <p>Hopkins found herself under fire in September when <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/katie-hopkins-fires-back-after-20053720">Little Mix's Jesy Nelson cited her fat-shaming tweet</a> as the point at which her depression spiralled out of control, leading to a suicide attempt.</p>

      <p>In the BBC documentary Odd One Out, Jesy recalled how she came off stage after an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> performance in 2013 to read a tweet from Hopkins that read: "Packet Mix have still got a chubber in their ranks. Less Little Mix. More Pick n Mix."</p>
      <p>Jesy revealed she'd not eaten for a week before her X Factor return in 2013 and was horrified when she saw what Hopkins said after the performance.</p>
      <p>The Little Mix star said: "All I remember feeling at that time is what’s the f**king point.</p>
      <p>"I've starved myself for a week and I'm still getting called fat. I could be the skinniest girl in the world and this is never going to go away.</p>

      <p>"That is the pinnacle point for me when I got severely depressed and it just spiralled out of control."</p>
      <p>Hopkins was also widely mocked more recently when she tried to slate the Duchess of Sussex, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> , on Australia's Channel 9 documentary 60 Minutes.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity</a> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> loser said of Meghan: "There she is in her one-shoulder dress, being glowing. Because all she does is glow.</p>
      <p>"Abdicate. Off you go.</p>
      <p>"She wears bad clothes, when did we ask for that?"</p>
      <p>But viewers fell about laughing at the short clip, with one tweeting back: "All this from a divorcee, who shags married men in fields, looks like she got dressed in the dark, is on the brink of bankruptcy and a nasty bitch on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to boot #MeghanMarkle #KatieHopkins."</p>
