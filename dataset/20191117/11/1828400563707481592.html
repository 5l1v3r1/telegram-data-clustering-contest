      <p>The news comes after the BBC One show's first series ended on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>With questions voiced by Rip Off Britain's Angela Rippon, the show saw team-mates work together in an attempt to win a cash prize.</p>
      <p>EastEnders star Dyer said: "I can't believe we're doing another series of The Wall.</p>
      <p>"I can't wait to get stuck back in and meet these new contestants and hopefully make them very rich. Drop Em!"</p>
      <p>Rippon said: "I am so looking forward to another series being 'the voice' of The Wall.</p>
      <p>"What a great opportunity for even more viewers to take on the challenge of The Wall and potentiality win life changing sums of money."</p>
      <p>The first episode of The Wall was watched by a consolidated audience of 4.1 million across 28 days, the broadcaster said.</p>
      <p>The game features a wall with slots that are either filled by a green ball, if a contestant answers correctly, or a red ball, if they do not.</p>
      <p>The green ball means they get money added, while red means they get money subtracted from whatever total they have.</p>
      <p>The format aired in 2016 on American's NBC television network, and counted among its executive producers basketball star LeBron James.</p>
      <p>Richard Hague, creative director at Remarkable Television, said: "A healthy dose of Danny, Angela and the infamous balls is the perfect tonic for where we are today in the world.</p>
      <p>"Danny has proven himself a truly unique host bringing a breath of fresh air to our Saturday night TV viewing.</p>
      <p>"Bring on series two and let's hope more contestants walk off cake-o bake-o."</p>
      <p>The Wall, from BBC One and Remarkable Television, part of Endemol Shine UK, will return to BBC One in 2020.</p>
