        <b><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sunday-people">According to a report from the Sunday People (17/11; page 50)</a>, Leeds United are planning to make a move for Birmingham City goalkeeper David Stockdale in January.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite the incredible end to last season, Leeds have not had a problem between the sticks this year. On the pitch, the Whites have seen the best of Kiko Casilla, and Marcelo Bielsa’s side boast the best defensive record in the Championship.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, it appears that Bielsa would like to sign a new stopper when the January window opens.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sunday-people">The Sunday People (17/11; page 50) reports</a> that Stockdale is on Bielsa’s radar. And it is also suggested that the 34-year-old would welcome the chance to move to Elland Road.</p>

      <p>Stockdale – who is a Leeds supporter (via <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11741/10744048/david-stockdale-wants-brighton-and-his-beloved-leeds-to-win-promotion">Sky Sports</a>) – has made just one appearance for Pep Clotet’s men this season.</p>
      <h3>TBR View – Stockdale could be a shrewd signing</h3>
      <p>Leeds have been able to rely on Casilla this season. But that does not mean that all of the club’s problems have been addressed.</p>
      <p>The Whites sold Bailey Peacock-Farrell to Burnley in the summer. That has left youngsters Illan Meslier and Kamil Miazek as Casilla’s understudies. So it is perhaps not a huge surprise that the promotion-chasers have their eye on signing a new goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>It will be interesting to see how the next few weeks shape Leeds’s January plans. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50394191">As reported by BBC Sport</a>, Casilla is facing a ban of at least six matches if he is found guilty of racially abusing Charlton Athletic’s Jonathan Leko during a game earlier this season. He has been charged, but strenuously denies the allegations.</p>
      <p>If found guilty, Casilla may miss a number of games around the turn of the year. That could leave Meslier or Miazek with a fantastic opportunity.</p>
      <p>Should either impress, Leeds may be tempted to shelve plans to target Stockdale. However, if they struggle or Casilla is found not guilty, then perhaps the club may feel that it is worth pursuing a move for the veteran in case the Spaniard is absent for any reason later on the campaign.</p>
