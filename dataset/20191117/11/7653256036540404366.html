      <p>MUMBAI: Former <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> chief minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Devendra-Fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a> was on Sunday heckled by some slogan-shouting workers of the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Sena">Shiv Sena</a> as he left Shivaji Park here after paying tribute to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Bal-Thackeray">Bal Thackeray</a> on his ninth death anniversary.</p>
      <p>Some workers of the Shiv Sena, which recently snapped ties with the BJP, standing close to the former CM's convoy shouted in Marathi Fadnavis' assembly poll campaign slogan: 'I will be back (as CM)' along with the Sena's traditional 'Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj ki jai' war cry.</p>
      <p>Fadnavis and his entourage, which included several senior BJP leaders, moved on without reacting to the jeers.</p>
      <p>There were no Sena leaders, except <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Uddhav-Thackeray">Uddhav Thackeray</a>'s PA Milind Narvekar, when Fadnavis arrived at Shivaji Park to pay tribute to the founder of the Maharashtrian party.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Fadnavis had tweeted a video containing some of the late Sena patriarch's rousing speeches, and had added his voice-over as a tribute.</p>
      <p>The Sena and the BJP contested the October Assembly polls together and won 161 seats between them, before the Uddhav Thackeray-led party's insistence on equal sharing of the chief ministerial tenure led to acrimony and stalemate in government formation.</p>
      <p>Following weeks of bitter political drama, the Sena is currently in the process of forming a non-BJP government with support from Congress and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Nationalist-Congress-Party">Nationalist Congress Party</a>.</p>
