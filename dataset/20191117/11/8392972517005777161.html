      <p>Victoria Barton just cannot catch a break in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a>.</p>
      <p>She was viciously raped by Lee Posner in her own house, she found out she was pregnant with his baby and her brother Robert killed her rapist and then ghosted her from prison.</p>

      </p>
      <p>That's not even counting the fact the one man she has met and liked since her ordeal turned out to be Lee's secret brother.</p>
      <p>She has also had to contend with Lee's mum Wendy knocking on her door every two minutes demanding access to the as yet unborn baby, while insisting her evil son was innocent.</p>
      <p>If all that wasn't enough for her to deal with, fans are convinced things will take an even worse turn for Vic when Wendy moves into the village with plans to steal the baby.</p>
      <p>She does spend most of her time there anyway so she may as well save on petrol by buying a house there!</p>
      <p>Fans are sure this is going to happen - and have even picked out the cottage that Wendy could live in.</p>
      <p>Nightmare mother Emma Barton's old house - Dale View!</p>
      <p>One wrote on Digital Spy Forums: "Apparently Wendy moves into Dale View."</p>

      <p>A second said: "Thereâ€™s no way it canâ€™t be a revenge plot."</p>
      <p>A third said: "I agree with another poster, I think the plan is to get close to her, and then kidnap the baby."</p>
      <p>However, other fans are furious that Wendy hasn't been arrested despite her endless stalking of Victoria.</p>
      <p>One said: "I think the writing has been ridiculous, as if you would ever let Lee and his mother Wendy harass you in your own home/village like that and not go to the police! They had plenty witnesses to the continual harassment, not realistic at all! #emmerdale #robron".</p>
      <p>Another said: "Not to mention the fact that Wendy and Luke both constantly interfered with witnesses and tried to destroy the case on numerous occasions during Roberts trial, but that had absolutely no legal repercussions whatsoever ðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª @emmerdale love selective justice!".</p>
