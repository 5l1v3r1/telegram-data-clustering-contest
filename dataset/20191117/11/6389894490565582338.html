      <h1>Jeremy Corbyn labels Labour nationalisation plans as 'very modest'</h1>

      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has claimed Labour’s spending and nationalisation plans are “very, very modest” in an attempt to reassure people the party is “not trying to grab hold of the economy”.</p>
      <p>Shadow chancellor John McDonnell announced on Thursday the party would part nationalise BT for £20bn and provide free full-fibre broadband across the country.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It was met with widespread shock among business groups and BT chief executive<b> </b>Philip Jansen said the cost of the plans would be £100bn.</p>
      <p>Labour has also pledged to nationalise water and energy utilities, train companies and the Royal Mail, which the CBI believes would have a joint cost of £196bn.</p>
      <p>Corbyn was asked on the BBC this morning if there was any part of the economy that would never be nationalised under a Labour government.</p>
      <p>He refused to answer the question, saying: “We’re not trying to grab hold of the economy…the public sector provisions we are making are very, very modest.</p>
      <p>“We want to bring out a just, reasonable society where the aspirations of the poorest are met alongside the aspirations of the rest.”</p>
      <p>Labour will release its manifest on Thursday, after its Clause V meeting with major party and union figures yesterday.</p>
      <p>One issue of contention within the party was whether a Labour manifesto should include freedom of movement in any Brexit deal it negotiates.</p>
      <p>Unite the Union boss Len McCluskey recently said Labour needed to end freedom of movement in the EU.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, other major party figures such as Momentum’s Jon Lansman has said the opposite.</p>
      <p>Corbyn refused to say explicitly this morning if the party would include freedom of movement in a potential Brexit deal.</p>
      <p>However, he did say there would be a “great deal” of immigration under Labour.</p>
      <p>“We cannot exist in isolation, therefore there has to be migration into Britain in order to maintain our economy and services,” he said.</p>
      <p>“That will be reflected in our policy that you will see on Thursday.”</p>
      <p>Foreign secretary Dominic Raab also refused to give concrete details of the Tories’ immigration policy to the BBC this morning.</p>
      <p>The party said it would implement a points-based system post-Brexit, which takes into account things like education, employment background and family status when approving immigration applications.</p>
      <p>However, Raab would not say what the immigration target would be.</p>

      <p>“We are not going to fix on an arbitrary target,” he said.</p>
      <p>“By exercising a points system you bring it down year-by-year.”</p>
