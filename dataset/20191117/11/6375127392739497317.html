      <h3>A three-day anti-criminality operation in the entire Central Luzon starting last Friday resulted in the arrest of nearly 600 law offenders including 21 of the region’s most wanted persons, Police Regional Office 3 director, Brigadier General Rhodel O. Sermonia said yesterday.</h3>
      <p>In a report to Philippine National Police Officer-in-Charge, Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa, the official said that the anti-crime sweeps also led in the confiscation of dozens of unlicensed firearms and other deadly weapons and illegal drugs and the surrender of 71 New People’s Army members.</p>
      <p>“This is in adherence to the marching order of Gen. Gamboa, the PNP-OIC to intensify, to reinvigorate and to focus on the anti-criminality drive and anti-insurgency efforts of the PNP,” Sermonia said.</p>
      <p>The official credited their accomplishments to the strong support of all Central Luzon local chief executives, the Armed Forces and the Regional Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (RTF-ELCAC 3) which is composed of officials from the Department of Education, Department of Social Welfare and Development, National Intelligence Coordinating Agency and the National Economic and Development Authority.</p>
      <p>He said that during the 3-day period, 71 former NPA fighters surrendered to local police and government authorities. So far, 105 former NPA members in Central Luzon have returned to the fold of the law and availed of the Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (E-CLIP) for rebel returnees.</p>
      <p>Sermonia said he has ordered all PRO3 provincial directors and chiefs-of-police to conduct intensified Simultaneous Anti-Criminality Law Enforcement Operations (SACLEO) as part of the crime mitigation efforts of the PNP to deprive criminals with the opportunity to commit crime relative to the security coverage that it has laid for the upcoming 30th SEA Games.</p>
      <p>The top Central Luzon police official bared that all security preparations for the 30th SEA Games are underway but still, he said they need the public’s full support and cooperation.</p>
      <p>He also issued a warning to all criminals that the full arm of the law will be used against them should they still prefer to disrupt peace and order in the following days.</p>
      <p>Sermonia said that while simulation exercises are being done in various areas of engagement for SEA Games, PNP units in Region 3 over the weekend have carried out actual and proactive crime prevention drive by accounting all wanted persons, clear the streets of drug personalities and take weapons and other instruments of violence from the hands of criminals before they can use them.<br/>spective areas.</p>
