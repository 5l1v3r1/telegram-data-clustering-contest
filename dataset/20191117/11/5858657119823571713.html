      <p>BEIRUT — Syrian opposition activists say airstrikes on a rebel-held village in the country’s northwest killed five people.</p>
      <p>The Syrian Civil Defence and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three women were among the victims.</p>
      <p>Sunday’s airstrike hit the village of Mallaja in Idlib province, the last major rebel stronghold in Syria.</p>
      <p>Last week, Syrian President Bashar Assad said his forces will soon retake Idlib.</p>
      <p>Assad said in an interview that they are now giving civilians some time to leave the area, which is dominated by al-Qaida-linked militants.</p>
      <p>Syrian troops launched a four-month offensive on the province earlier this year, forcing hundreds of thousands of civilians to flee their homes.</p>
      <p>A fragile cease-fire stopped the government offensive on Idlib at the end of August.</p>
