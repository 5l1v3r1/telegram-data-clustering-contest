      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:53:38+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:53</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has ruled out a second Scottish Independence referendum for at least the first two years of a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> government.</p>
      <p>He faced demands from the SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford to commit to another referendum within a year of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> .</p>
      <p>But the Labour leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr: "No, I can't give him that commitment.</p>
      <p>"Because what I want to do is win an election. What I want to do is start the process of reinvesting in this country, of bringing forward all the proposals that we've got for a national investment bank, regional investment banks in England, and investment in Scotland that will get £70 billion of investment.</p>
      <p>"I do not want us to spend the first year on an independence referendum."</p>
      <p>He added: "I say gently to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> , they will have the opportunity, with a Labour government in Westminster, of seeing a fair allocation of resources to Scotland.</p>
      <p>"They will see an investment in Scotland that will help deal with the massive health and social inequalities they've got?"</p>

      <p>Asked whether he would commit to a referendum in the first term of a Labour government, Mr Corbyn said: "I'm saying in the early years of this government we wouldn't want to do that.</p>
      <p>"There are Scottish elections in 2021 which obviously I hope Labour win in Holyrood, but up until then certainly not."</p>
      <p>And he ruled out a deal with the SNP if Labour are the largest party but fail to win a majority in the December 12 poll.</p>
      <p>He said: "We are not doing deals with anybody."</p>
      <p>"We are not forming coalition governments, we will put forward the programme on which we will have been elected," he said.</p>
      <p>"The SNP will have a choice, do they want to put <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> back in ... or are they going to say a Labour government will deliver for Scotland."</p>

      <p>Earlier, Mr Blackford claimed that a "move towards independence is unstoppable, it will not change whether there is a Corbyn or a Johnson government in London."</p>
      <p>He argued that to refuse Scotland the power to hold another independence referendum would be undemocratic if the SNP wins the most seats in the looming General Election.</p>
      <p>Mr Blackford told Mr Marr that the SNP were "wanting to lock the Tories out of office" to prevent the UK leaving the European Union, in addition to fighting for a second independence referendum.</p>
      <p>"Our priorities, principally, in this election is about making sure we can escape <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> - that's the first thing - but also securing Scotland's right to choose its own future", Mr Blackford said when asked about forming potential coalitions with other parties.</p>
      <p>On the issue of securing powers to hold another Scottish independence referendum, he said: "It doesn't matter if it's Jeremy Corbyn or if its anyone else, whoever is Prime Minister has got to respect democracy and the simple fact of the matter is the SNP won the election to the Scottish Parliament in 2016 on a manifesto commitment of a referendum if there was a change of circumstances."</p>
