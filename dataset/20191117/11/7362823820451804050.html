      <h1>Trump criticism got Colorado talk radio host fired while on air, he says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:48:15+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:48</time> by <a rel="author">Nicole Darrah</a></address>
      <p>A radio host claims he was fired Saturday from his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/colorado">Colorado talk show</a> — while he was on air — for criticizing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a>.</p>
      <p>Craig Silverman, host of a namesake show on Denver's conservative <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media">710 KNUS radio station</a>, says he was talking about Roy Cohn, a lawyer who previously represented Trump, when suddenly his broadcast was interrupted by network news.</p>

        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Soon after, Silverman <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/11/16/craig-silverman-radio-show-donald-trump/">told The Denver Post</a>, the station's program director walked through the door and told him, "You're done." The host <a href="https://twitter.com/craigscolorado/status/1195783103643414528">confirmed his firing</a> online, tweeting in response to a state representative who said his firing was a "sad day for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west">Colorado</a> and the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/first-amendment">First Amendment</a>."</p>

      <p>"I cannot and will not toe strict Trump party line. I call things as I see them," he said. "I see corruption and blatant dishonesty <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house">by President</a> [sic] and his cronies. I also see bullying/smearing of American heroes w/courage to take oath and tell truth. Their bravery inspires me."</p>

      </p>
      <p>The day before his termination, Silverman wrote a supportive <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/facebook">Facebook</a> post about Marie Yovanovitch, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics">former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine</a> who testified last week on the second day of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">Trump's public impeachment hearings</a>.</p>

      <p>“Yovanovitch is an American hero. I have seen countless witnesses testify and she was one of the all-time finest. Her poise, courage and credibility inspire me,” Silverman wrote, <a href="https://kdvr.com/2019/11/16/denver-talk-radio-host-craig-silverman-fired-mid-show-after-criticizing-trump/">according to KDVR</a>.</p>

      <p>Silverman added the response to his firing has been about "95% nice," and <a href="https://twitter.com/craigscolorado/status/1195873101105393664">posted a message</a> from a former Republican attorney general in Colorado who thanked him "for speaking truth to power" about "Trump's destructive behavior."</p>
      <p>A former chief deputy district attorney <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/cities">in Denver</a>, Silverman was on air Saturdays from 9 a.m. to noon since 2014. A search of his program on the <a href="https://710knus.com/content/all/craigsilverman">710 KNUS website</a> redirects to a 404 Error page.</p>
