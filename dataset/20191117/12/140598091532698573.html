      <h1>Elliott Whitehead concedes Great Britain players 'let themselves down' during dismal tour whitewash</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:58:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/ross-heppenstall/" target="_blank">Ross Heppenstall</a></address>
      <p>Elliott Whitehead accepted Great Britain’s tour had been a failure before stressing the need for a mid-season Test before England’s Ashes series against Australia next year.</p>
      <p>Revived after 12 years in hibernation, the Lions crashed to a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-league/2019/11/16/great-britain-suffer-tour-whitewash-aspapua-new-guinea-inflict/">28-10 defeat at the hands of Papua New Guinea</a> on Saturday, completing a dismal 4-0 series whitewash.</p>
      <p>It followed previous losses against a Tonga Invitational XIII and New Zealand, twice, and raised further questions over coach Wayne Bennett’s future with the Rugby Football League.</p>
      <p>Canberra Raiders second-rower Whitehead was honest enough to admit: “It has been a disappointing tour all round and we didn’t turn up like we should have done.</p>
      <p>“I think all the boys know we’ve let ourselves down. We’ll go away and hopefully we can come back next year as a group and fix stuff up.”</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if Bennett will remain in charge heading into next year’s home Ashes series with England, who host the 2021 World Cup 12 months later.</p>

      <p>But Whitehead is adamant that they need to be better prepared than Great Britain were and stressed the need for a mid-season Test after it did not happen this year.</p>
      <p>The former Bradford and Catalans forward reasoned: “I believe the NRL clubs and Super League clubs really need to invest and let players have time off.</p>
      <p>“I feel we really missed the mid-season Test this year as a group and hopefully we can get it back next year.</p>
      <p>“That will help us going into the Australia series at the end of the year.”</p>
      <p>Under-fire Bennett's contract with the RFL has now expired and chief executive Ralph Rimmer spoke last week about not making any decision on the Australian's future until the completion of a wide-ranging review.</p>
      <p>In a statement published in the wake of Saturday's upset, the governing body says nothing has changed.</p>
      <p>The statement said: “Like everyone involved on the tour, we are obviously bitterly disappointed by the results of the Test matches - for those loyal and passionate supporters who have followed the team in New Zealand and Papua New Guinea and for everyone backing the team from home.</p>
      <p>“As stated last week, an objective review of all aspects of the tour will take place when the tour party returns and that timetable has not altered.”</p>
