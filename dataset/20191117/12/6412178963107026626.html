        <b>Jose Mourinho passed up on the chance to sign Harry Maguire for just £60m at Manchester United last summer, a report claims.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/harry-maguire-reveals-why-he-could-not-turn-down-man-utd-after-sealing-80m-move"><b>Maguire became the most expensive defender in history when United paid Leicester £80m for him this summer</b></a>, beating off competition from their rivals Manchester City.</p>
      <p>United’s interest in the England man went back further, though – and it is now claimed that they could have signed him for £20m less had it not been for <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/managers/jose-mourinho"><b>Mourinho</b></a>.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/jose-mourinho-refused-pay-more-20895867"><i>Mirror</i></a>, Mourinho was interested in <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/tag/harry-maguire"><b>Maguire</b></a> during his last transfer window as United manager in summer 2018. However, when told of his £60m price tag, the Portuguese tactician turned his back on the deal, reportedly “embarrassed” at the prospect of paying more than £50m for him.</p>
      <p>“A move was made for Maguire in the summer of 2018 – with Jose Mourinho’s blessing,” the <i>Mirror</i>‘s Old Trafford insider revealed.</p>
      <p>“But Jose’s interest in signing the player came with a proviso. He said that while Maguire was an excellent player, he wasn’t worth more than £50million.</p>
      <p>“In fact, he said paying more than £50million would embarrass him.</p>
      <p>“The club was armed with that valuation when they spoke to Leicester – who immediately made it clear they would not sell Maguire for less than £60million.</p>
      <p>“The deal was dead before United had even made a formal bid – and when it was decided to move for Maguire again a year later, his price had gone up to £80million.”</p>
