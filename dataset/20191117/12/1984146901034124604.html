      <h1>More children than ever getting help for questions over gender identity or being transgender</h1>
      <h2>The Gender Identity Development Service, based in Leeds and London, is supporting more and more North East children</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Graham</a></address>
      <p>More and more children are getting help for issues with their gender identity.</p>
      <p>Figures from the Gender Identity Development Service, a specialist service based in London and Leeds which supports children who may be transgender, show at least 142 children have been referred for help from the North East.</p>
      <p>That was up from 135 the year before and 111 in 2016/17. Staff at the service say increasing awareness of the options for people who want to explore their gender identity may be driving the rise.</p>
      <p>Across the North East, 24 children receiving treatment had been referred from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/nhs-northumberland-ccgs-journey-back-16716868">Northumberland clinical commissioning group (CCG)</a> - the highest in our region.</p>
      <p>The true number is likely to be higher than 142 children, because Gateshead CCG, Newcastle North and East CCG and Newcastle West CCG didn't release their exact figures, as fewer than five children had been referred.</p>
      <p>The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust runs the Gender Identity Development service, which this year has treated at least 2,942 children aged 17 and under from across the UK.</p>
      <p>The vast majority, 2,523 children, were aged between 12 and 17, but some were significantly younger, with six children aged five accessing the service.</p>
      <p>The service helps children who have questions about their gender. Some may say they are, or feel that they are, a gender other than the one they were registered as at birth, while others feel that neither "boy" nor "girl" applies to them.</p>
      <p>The service says it aims to "help young people and their families cope with distress, and to reduce it".</p>
      <p>This can involve physical interventions, such as prescribing hormone blockers (which reversibly delay puberty) or hormones usually associated with the other sex (which cause some long-term changes such a voice breaking), but the staff say a "substantial proportion" of its patients do not have any physical interventions. Other support, including family therapy, and help for children who want to 'socially transition' (live as a different gender in day to day life) is also provided.</p>
      <p>As a child and adolescent service, it does not provide any surgery.</p>
      <p>But one charity which supports gender diverse and transgender children said youngsters were waiting too long for help and facing what it called a "tortuous delay".</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the charity Mermaids said: "It's vital that transgender and gender diverse children get the support they need immediately so they can avoid the distress caused by feeling lost, trapped and alone.</p>
      <p>“Research shows a high instance of self-harm and suicidal tendencies amongst kids and teens struggling with their gender identity and the figures are backed up by our own 25 years of experience.</p>
      <p>“The good news is that worried parents see a huge difference in their children when they're allowed to explore their gender and express who they are.</p>
      <p>“Moods improve, school grades get better, friends are made and a kid who'd seemed sad, angry and isolated comes back to life.</p>
      <p>“That's why the guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) advises affirmative care, which means allowing people to live as the gender they truly are, not the gender assigned to them at birth.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, the Tavistock Centre chooses to take a more questioning approach.</p>
      <p>“This, combined with a wait for consultations of up to two years and a further wait to access puberty blockers, is causing a tortuous delay for many young people and we would urge the government to give more funding to the service and for our NHS specialists to assume the WPATH approach.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson from the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust said: “We work closely with young people and their families – plus local healthcare teams when appropriate – to provide support and information as they explore their gender identity development.</p>
      <p>“We treat every young person who visits our service individually on a case-by case basis. Our clinicians have no preference or expectation for what pathway each young person may choose to follow in relation to their gender identification.</p>
      <p>“We appreciate that it can be difficult for young people and their family while waiting for a first appointment at GIDS and are working hard to reduce the waiting times.</p>
      <p>“Those on the waiting list can contact a GIDS clinician for any concerns or queries while waiting for a first appointment. GIDS is a highly specialist service and operates in a network model with local services.</p>
      <p>“There is an important role for local mental health services to support young people with co-occuring mental health or developmental difficulties.</p>
      <p>“Similarly, increased awareness of the range of options open to young people and local support to explore their gender preferences prior to attending highly specialist services is helpful as a substantial proportion of young people referred to the service do not ultimately follow a physical treatment pathway.”</p>
