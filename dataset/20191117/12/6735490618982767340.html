      <p>Chalk up a win for “Ford v Ferrari”, with the Christian Bale-starring racing drama rocketing to the finish line to capture the top spot at the weekend box office.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/2019W46/?ref_=bo_wey_table_1"><i>Box Office Mojo</i></a>, “Ford v Ferrari” landed in first place with a $31-million domestic opening, with the James Mangold-directed feature tallying a worldwide total of $52 million so far.</p>
      <p>“We knew it was a real crowd pleaser,” Cathleen Taff, Disney’s president of global distribution told <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/box-office/box-office-ford-v-ferrari-wins-charlies-angels-flops-1203407329/"><i>Variety</i></a><i>.</i> “With the caliber of talent from director James Mangold and Christian Bale and Matt Damon, it felt like a must-see movie. We’re thrilled to see it breaking out.”</p>

      <p>The news was not as good for the other high-profile release to hit theatres this weekend, with “Charlie’s Angels” landing in third place with a disappointing domestic opening of just $8.6 million, well below the $13 million-plus the studio had been anticipating.</p>
      <p>“Midway” captured the second-place spot with $8.7 million in ticket sales in its second weekend, for a two-week domestic total of $35.1 million.</p>

      <p>Rounding out the top five: the John Cena comedy “Playing with Fire” in fourth place, adding $8.5 million for a two-week domestic total of $25.5 million; and Emilia Clarke’s “Last Christmas”, which delivered $6.7 million domestically in its second weekend, for a total to date of $22.5 million.</p>
