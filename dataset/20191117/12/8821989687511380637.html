      <h1>When Eddie Murphy Got Into James Brown’s Hot Tub</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:00:07+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Lifton</a></address>
      <p>What happens when one of the funniest men in the world became the Hardest Working Man in Show Business? The April 24, 1982 episode of <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/saturday-night-live/"><i>Saturday Night Live</i></a> saw <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/eddie-murphy/">Eddie Murphy</a> do his impression of James Brown for the first time.</p>
      <p>The sketch was little more than Murphy, as Soul Brother No. 1, singing selections from <i>Annie</i> (the movie adaptation of the hit Broadway musical was about to be released). But it was the next time he impersonated Brown, on Nov. 5, 1983, that wound up becoming one of the most famous sketches of Eddie Murphy's time on the show, "James Brown's Celebrity Hot Tub Party."</p>
      <p>Wearing nothing but a wig, gold bikini briefs and a bathrobe that read "Hot Tub Man #1," Murphy sang and danced around a hot tub while the band played an approximation of Brown's funk-defining tracks of the late '60s and early '70s such as "Cold Sweat," "Hot Pants," "I Got the Feeling" "Super Bad" and "Mother Popcorn." At one point, they re-created Brown's cape stunt from <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tami-show/"><i>The T.A.M.I. Show</i></a> before Murphy shed the robe and got in the water.</p>

      <p>Murphy only played Brown one more time on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, on Feb. 25, 1984, where he was interviewed by the host, veteran newsman Edwin Newman, whose lengthy questions were met with rambling from Murphy. That turned out to be Murphy's last episode as a cast member.</p>
      <p>Fans also got a taste of his James Brown impression in the summer of 1983 in Murphy's stand-up concert film <i>Delirious</i>. "You don't have to be able to talk to sing and get famous," Murphy said. "James Brown's been singing for 20 years. I don't know what the fuck James is talking about. I don't understand shit James says. I met him once at <i>Saturday Night Live,</i> walked up to him and said, 'James, I love your stuff.' He said, '[incomprehensible mumbles].' And whatever James is saying is some real heavy shit to James. ... 'cause at the end of every sentence, he ended off with 'Huh!'"</p>
      <p>That was followed by about a minute-long impersonation of a typical Brown song, complete with shouts to Maceo Parker and a little bit of call-and-response with Brown's hype man Bobby Byrd in "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine" thrown in for good measure.</p>

      <p>In 2007, Murphy told <a href="https://www.accessonline.com/articles/what-james-brown-wanted-from-eddie-murphy-57849">Access</a> that Brown once approached him about starring in a biopic of the legend. Murphy said, "I said, ‘James, if I do you, people will be laughing.' [He said], 'They ain’t gonna laugh if you don’t try to be funny.'"</p>
      <p>But he also acknowledged that, at this point in his life, playing James Brown would have been too physically demanding. "I couldn’t do James Brown now until he got [to] 40, ‘cause I’m 45. I’ll be 46 in April and I’m not doin’ no splits and no shit like that and rippin’ my ass out tryin’ to make no movie. The split days are gone."</p>
      <p>Instead, he based his performance of James "Thunder" Early in <i>Dreamgirls</i> on Brown. The role earned Murphy the best reviews of his film career, as well as the Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, New York Film Critics Society and BET Awards, as well as an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.</p>

      <h4>Simon and Garfunkel: October 18, 1975</h4>
      <p>'SNL' has scored many landmark musical moments over the course of its existence, chief among them this amazing reunion. The episode marked the first TV appearance by Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel since their breakup in 1970. Together, the duo delivered intimate performances of seminal tracks “The Boxer” and "Scarborough Fair,” before diving into the new song “My Little Town.” Fans even got to see the legendary pair share in some lighthearted ribbing, as Simon started their first performance by looking at Garfunkel and quipping, “So, you’ve come crawling back.”</p>

      <h4>Paul McCartney: February 13, 1993</h4>
      <p>Paul McCartney has been a music guest on 'Saturday Night Live' four times and even delivered a surprise cameo during another episode. His appearances have been littered with Beatles and solo classics, making choosing a definitive performance difficult. The nod goes to this Season 18 episode for two clear reasons: 1) McCartney’s moving rendition of “Hey Jude” 2) Macca’s comedic timing and deadpan delivery during 'The Chris Farley Show' sketch.</p>

      <h4>Prince: February 21, 1981</h4>
      <p>In early 1981, Prince was still in the initial stages of his meteoric rise. The artist’s first three albums earned strong sales and delivered successful singles, but Prince was still yet to become a full-fledged superstar. His lone performance this night on the 'SNL' stage was “Partyup,” the energetic closing track from 1980’s ‘Dirty Mind.’ The purple one strutted to the mic and confidently declared “Down with war, party up!” before launching into the funk-filled track. The mesmerizing performance announced Prince’s arrival on the national stage. The ‘80s would prove to be an era owned by Prince. Over the decade, his songs spent more weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart than any other artist.</p>

      <h4>Queen: September 25, 1982</h4>
      <p>In what proved to be the final U.S. performance by Freddie Mercury, the legendary singer took the 'SNL' stage with a blown-out voice (the result of a heated argument with his boyfriend the night before). That didn’t stop the enigmatic frontman from delivering a memorable performance as the band tore through a rocking rendition of “Crazy Little Thing Called Love,” followed by the soaring “Under Pressure” (with drummer Roger Taylor taking the vocal parts originally sung by David Bowie). Though the band continued touring for four more years, it never returned to the States. Mercury died in 1991.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Elvis Costello: December 17, 1977</h4>
      <p>This performance has become a thing of legend, but remains a story worth retelling. After the Sex Pistols had to cancel their scheduled 'SNL' performance, newcomer Elvis Costello was invited to fill in. The rocker’s debut album ‘My Aim Is True’ had just come out in America and his record label insisted he play his recent single “Less Than Zero” on the show. Costello disagreed with the choice and didn’t enjoy being told what to do. In an act of rebellion, the singer switched songs 10 seconds into his performance (an idea he’d gleaned from Jimi Hendrix). Instead of sticking with “Less Than Zero,” Costello tore through the the blistering anti-establishment song “Radio Radio.” The act got him banned from 'SNL' for a dozen years.</p>

      <h4>Beastie Boys: September 27, 1999</h4>
      <p>In celebration of 'Saturday Night Live'’s 25th anniversary, Brooklyn rap-rockers Beastie Boys were invited to perform. Inspired by the legendary antics of Elvis Costello (see previous entry), the Beastie Boys stopped their performance of “Sabotage” just 10 seconds into it. At that point, Costello joined the band onstage for “Radio Radio,” recreating a legendary moment more than two decades after it first occurred.</p>

      <h4>The Rolling Stones: October 7, 1978</h4>
      <p>The Stones pulled double duty during their first 'SNL' appearance, acting as both the host and musical guest. The band appeared in two sketches that evening, but unsurprisingly, it was during the musical numbers that it truly shined. Over the course of an emphatic, 13-minute performance, the band rattled off three songs from their 1978 LP ‘Some Girls’: “Beast of Burden,” “Shattered” and “Respectable.” During the latter, Mick Jagger leaned over to Ronnie Wood and licked the guitarist’s face.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Aerosmith: February 17, 1990</h4>
      <p>Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar were the biggest rock super-fans to ever grace 'Saturday Night Live.' So when Aerosmith were booked as the musical guest in early 1990, the band naturally had to appear in a Wayne’s World sketch. In it, Garth’s roadie cousin, Barry - played by Tom Hanks - convinces the band to make a promotional appearance on the Aurora, Ill., cable-access show. Aerosmith even join Wayne and Garth for a sweet performance of the 'Wayne’s World' theme song. Sure, the band delivered excellent renditions of “Janie’s Got a Gun” and “Monkey on My Back” during the traditional musical set, but the night’s highlight was definitely their performance in Wayne’s basement.</p>

      <h4>Neil Young: September 30, 1989</h4>
      <p>Young had been indulging in an experimental period that lasted most of the ‘80s, resulting in the lowest album sales of his career. "Rockin' In the Free World" signaled the singer’s return to prominence, and his 'Saturday Night Live' appearance punctuated the comeback. Wearing faded jeans, an Elvis T-shirt and a leather jacket, Young electrified the studio audience and viewers at home with a virtuoso rock performance. The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer later revealed that he worked out with a trainer before going onstage that night, ensuring that his energy level was ratcheted up to a necessary extreme. The exercise worked, as he delivered what may arguably be the greatest rock performance in the history of 'SNL.'</p>

      <h4>AC/DC: March 18, 2000</h4>
      <p>AC/DC formed in 1973. 'Saturday Night Live' made its television debut two years later. With such similar timelines, it’s shocking to think it took more than 25 years for one of hard rock’s most legendary acts to grace the 'SNL' stage. Still, the performance was worth the wait, as the Australian rockers delivered an explosive performance of “You Shook Me All Night Long” along with the title track from their 2000 album 'Stiff Upper Lip.' Hopefully fans won't have to wait another 25 years for an encore.</p>

      <h4>David Bowie: December 15, 1979</h4>
      <p>A robotic pink poodle. Backing singers who looked like aliens. A strange blue-screened, marionette-type performance. These were all elements in David Bowie’s exceedingly strange 'SNL' appearance. Wearing a stylish, button-up dress, the iconic singer powered through renditions of “TVC15” and “Boys Keep Swinging.” The visuals were strange, the delivery was surreal, all of it was engrossing. It was, in a word, Bowie.</p>

      <h4>Joe Cocker and John Belushi: October 2, 1976</h4>
      <p>John Belushi’s impression of Joe Cocker was already a series highlight long before the singer appeared on 'SNL.' Cocker’s twisting facial features, quirky mannerisms and distinctive vocal delivery seemed custom-made for Belushi’s brand of physical comedy. The comedian had mixed his impersonation into his stand-up sets for years, well before he became one of 'SNL’'s breakout stars. Cocker, for his part, was a fan of the impression and seemed comfortable embracing the humor of it all. For his appearance on 'Saturday Night Live,' the singer began with a soulful version of his hit song “You Are So Beautiful.” Still, it’s his second song of the night that people always remember. Cocker was joined by Belushi (doing his Cocker imitation) on a duet performance of “Feelin’ Alright.” The outfits, the voices, the movements - everything between the two stars worked perfectly. It remains one of the most memorable moments from 'SNL'’s early years.</p>

      <h4>Nirvana: January 11, 1992</h4>
      <p>Nirvana’s pivotal album ‘Nevermind’ was released on Sept. 24, 1991. It debuted at No. 144 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. By January 1992 it was selling more than 300,000 copies a week, the biggest LP in the world. The same week they appeared on 'Saturday Night Live,' Nirvana replaced Michael Jackson at the top of the Billboard chart. The 'SNL' performance was more than just a celebration, it was a coronation of rock’s grunge kings. The group charged through a head-banging rendition of “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” before later indulging in the punk-leaning “Territorial Pissings.” At the close of the latter, the band trashed its instruments. It was raw, dynamic and everything their fans wanted to see.</p>

      <h4>Pearl Jam: April 16, 1994</h4>
      <p>Pearl Jam’s second appearance on 'SNL' came just days after the shocking death of fellow grunge icon Kurt Cobain. Though Pearl Jam and Nirvana had been involved in a rock rivalry, they were the unquestioned musical pillars of the grunge movement. By delivering powerful and emotional renditions of “Not for You,” “Rearviewmirror” and “Daughter” on the 'SNL' stage, Eddie Vedder and company made a clear statement: Though Cobain was gone, grunge had not died along with him. While standing onstage during the closing credits, Vedder opened his jacket to reveal a shirt with the letter K written over his heart. The moment was a somber tribute from one frontman to another.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Elton John (with Johnny Cash): April 17, 1982</h4>
      <p>This was one of those rare moments in pop-culture history that featured two musical icons sharing the spotlight at decidedly different points of their respective careers. Cash was the long-established star, already having a career that spanned more than three decades. The country legend appeared on 'SNL' just months after releasing his 68th album, 'The Adventures of Johnny Cash.' John certainly was no newcomer. By 1982 he had firmly staked his claim as one of the biggest stars on the planet behind hits like “Your Song,” "Rocket Man” and “Bennie and the Jets.” Still, their dual appearance on 'SNL' felt in many ways like a passing of the torch. In a nod to Cash, who was the show’s host that evening, John wore cowboy-inspired attire during each of his performances (of course he had a costume change!). For his part, Cash turned in a reciprocal homage to John’s signature clothing style, with the man in black donning a pink feather boa, sequined robe and gaudy glasses during one of the evening’s highlights.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Billy Joel: February 18, 1978</h4>
      <p>This 'SNL' episode lives on in history for a bevy of reasons. First and foremost was its host, Chevy Chase, returning to the show that launched his career (and from which he quickly departed to become an even bigger star). Though Chase still scored many laughs while onscreen, behind the scenes he was causing drama. Upon the comedian’s departure, Bill Murray had become 'SNL'’s newest star. The two didn’t like each other, with tempers flaring backstage in a battle of the alpha funnymen. Still, for our purposes, this episode is best remembered for the 'Saturday Night Live' debut of Billy Joel. The 29-year-old wore a scruffy beard and radiant smile as he sat behind the piano and delivered two of his best-known tracks: “Only The Good Die Young” and “Just The Way You Are.” The New York native would return to the 'SNL' stage three more times throughout his career, but this debut performance really showcased the spark that made Joel one of the most beloved songwriters of his generation.</p>

      <h4>Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: November 19, 1994</h4>
      <p>The legendary Tom Petty made a total of eight appearances on 'SNL' over the course of his career and choosing a favorite isn’t easy. Still, in terms of rock history its difficult to look past this 1994 performance. Petty had recently fired Heartbreakers drummer Stan Lynch and needed someone to fill in. He reached out to Dave Grohl, who was still reeling from the death of his friend and Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. Grohl accepted the offer to sit behind the kit with Petty on 'SNL' and together they tore through ferocious performances of “You Don’t Know How It Feels” and “Honey Bee.” Petty enjoyed the experience so much, he offered Grohl a permanent position in the Heartbreakers. The drummer respectfully declined the offer, choosing instead to focus on his own burgeoning project: Foo Fighters.</p>

      <h4>Grateful Dead: November 11, 1978</h4>
      <p>Iconic counterculture group the Grateful Dead were already more than a decade into their career when they appeared on 'Saturday Night Live' for the first time. The band started its performance with “Casey Jones,” a fan-favorite track from their 1970 album ‘Workingman’s Dead.’ From there, the group returned with a lively medley of “I Need A Miracle” and “Good Lovin',” two songs featured on their ‘Shakedown Street’ LP, which would be officially released just a few days after their 'SNL' appearance.</p>

      <p>Bovi Jovi rode their steel horse to Rockefeller Center for this memorable 'Saturday Night Live' appearance. Their 1992 album, ‘Keep the Faith,’ had been released two months prior. It’s standout power ballad “Bed of Roses” was the first song played during the 'SNL' set. Later, a soaring version of their hit song “Wanted Dead or Alive” brought the studio audience to its feet. John Bon Jovi even appeared alongside host Danny DeVito in one of the sketches that night, though the rock star's acting chops have definitely improved since then.</p>

      <h4>George Harrison: November 20, 1976</h4>
      <p>An ongoing 'SNL' gag in 1976 featured the show’s producer, Lorne Michaels, enticing the Beatles to reunite on his show for a cool $3,000. Though the bribe almost worked - John Lennon and Paul McCartney happened to be watching nearby and briefly considered heading to the 30 Rock studio - a Beatles reunion wasn’t to be. Still, that didn’t stop George Harrison from attempting to get his share of the cash during episode eight of Season Two. In the show’s cold open, Harrison is seen arguing with Michaels over money he insists he is owed. The quiet Beatle would be the musical guest that night, teaming with show host Paul Simon on gorgeous versions of “Here Comes the Sun” and “Homeward Bound.”</p>

      <h4>Fear: October 31, 1981</h4>
      <p>One of the most legendary punk rock performances of all time took place on Halloween 1981. Former 'SNL' cast member John Belushi was a huge fan of the Washington, D.C., group Fear and used his influence to get the band booked on the show. Belushi, in an effort to make the performance authentically punk, arranged for a group of hardcore fans to be in the studio audience. When the camera turned on for Fear’s television debut, the punks in the audience went ballistic. A mosh pit ensued, bodies were thrown around, a pumpkin was heaved into the chest of 'SNL' producer Dick Ebersol and the band embraced the chaos of it all. Fear frontman Lee Ving added fuel to the fire, thanking the people of New Jersey before launching into the anti-New York song “New York’s Alright if You Like Saxophones.” When one rowdy fan grabbed the mic and dropped an f-bomb, the network finally had enough. It cut away from the performance and into a prerecorded Eddie Murphy sketch. Fear were immediately added to the list of bands banned from 'SNL' for life.</p>

      <h4>The Band: October 30, 1976</h4>
      <p>Lorne Michaels was desperate to book the Band in the lead-up to their farewell concert, ‘The Last Waltz.’ The 'SNL' head honcho even offered the group a hosting gig, which it kindly turned down. Instead, the Band accepted an extended performance slot. Backed by a full horn section, the group delivered rousing renditions of "Life Is a Carnival," "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down" and "Stage Fright" before closing with their version of “Georgia on My Mind.”</p>

      <h4>Bob Dylan: October 20, 1979</h4>
      <p>Dylan’s lone performance on 'Saturday Night Live' came in 1979. The legendary singer-songwriter appeared in support of his latest album at the time, the gospel-inspired ‘Slow Train Coming.’ Buoyed by a group of soulful backing singers, Dylan chose “Gotta Serve Somebody,” the LP’s first single, to begin his 'SNL' set. The song would later earn the rocker his first Grammy Award. A stripped-down, acoustic rendition of “I Believe in You” would mark Dylan’s second song that night, before a funked-out version of “When You Gonna Wake Up” closed the evening’s performances.</p>

      <h4>Clash: October 9, 1982</h4>
      <p>The Clash’s 1982 album ‘Combat Rock’ was largely inspired by the aftermath of the Vietnam War. The band maintained this feeling by wearing combat fatigues and adding camouflage netting to the 'SNL' stage during their performance. The band chose the trippy “Straight to Hell” as their first song of the night, with Joe Strummer belting out lyrics while donning a Travis Bickel-style mohawk. Mick Jones took lead vocals on the second performance of the night, providing ample energy for “Should I Stay or Should I Go.”</p>

      <h4>Eric Clapton: March 24, 1990</h4>
      <p>Eric Clapton started his career in 1962. It wouldn’t be until 1990 that he made his 'SNL' debut, but the legendary guitarist and singer made sure the wait was worth it. From the soaring solos on “No Alibis” to the driving rhythms of “Pretending,” Clapton delivered a virtuoso performance. His third and final song of the evening, the beloved 1977 ballad “Wonderful Tonight,” closed the show on a poignant tone. This was one of rock’s great performers completely in his element, and, with more than three decades of experience under his belt, he was showing no signs of slowing.</p>

      <h4>Paul Simon: October 13, 2018</h4>
      <p>No musician has appeared on 'SNL' more than Paul Simon. His first appearance came on Oct.18, 1975 - the second episode in the show’s history. He would go on to host the show four times, be the musical guest nine times and provide cameos another five times. Do the math and that makes 18 appearances on the late-night show. On his final, record-setting performance, the 'Saturday Night Live' cast took the opportunity to celebrate the legend’s 77th birthday. The singer delivered a touching performance of “Bridge Over Troubled Water,” complete with string, brass and percussion arrangements. His appearance followed his final Farewell Tour performances, giving fans who were unable to see him in person a glimpse and the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer’s singular talents.</p>

      <p>Dave Grohl may be the only musician who could potentially threaten Paul Simon’s 'SNL' record. Between stints with Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Tom Petty and Them Crooked Vultures, Grohl has racked up 13 appearances on the late-night show. This 2011 Foo favorite provides all the elements that make Grohl a fantastic guest. Musical numbers “Rope” and “Walk” were tight, energetic and loud, while the frontman’s noted sense of humor shone through during the “Bongo’s Clown Room” sketch, as Grohl slicked his hair back into a ponytail while playing a strip-club announcer.</p>

      <h4>Sinead O’Connor: October 3, 1992</h4>
      <p>It was a performance, and a statement, that resonated far beyond the studio at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. During an a cappella rendition of Bob Marley’s “War,” Irish singer Sinead O’Connor tore a picture of Pope John Paul II in half. The act was a sign of protest against generations of abuse toward children within the Catholic church. In 1992, these terrible actions against children were far less known than they are today. As such, outcry against O’Connor’s stunt was deafening. Radio stations pulled her songs from rotation while religious groups destroyed her albums. The 'SNL' appearance became a defining political and pop-culture moment of the early '90s.</p>

The group’s members also appeared in one of the show’s sketches, catching the eye of producer Dick Ebersol. The TV veteran proceeded to offer Spinal Tap actors Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean roles in the 'SNL' cast. Guest and Shearer accepted, though they stuck around for only one season. McKean initially declined the offer, but ended up joining the show 10 years later.</p>

      <p>Metallica were originally slated to make their 'SNL' debut in 1987, but a wrist injury to frontman James Hetfield forced the band to cancel. Ten years later, the group finally made its first appearance on the show, performing fiery renditions of “Fuel” and “The Memory Remains.” Amazingly, it stands as the only 'SNL' appearance for the legendary rockers. We're still waiting for a return appearance.</p>

      <p>Though the band Van Halen never officially performed on 'SNL', fans got to see Eddie Van Halen make an unexpected stop on the late-night show in 1987. The host that evening was Valerie Bertinelli, Van Halen’s wife at the time. Eddie showed off his acting range in a classic sketch titled "Dinner With the Van Halens," in which the married couple enjoy a double date while a trio of roadies (played by Dennis Miller, Dana Carvey and Kevin Nealon) buzz around the table. But the true highlight was Van Halen jamming with G.E. Smith and the 'SNL' house band on an instrumental number titled "Stompin' 8H."</p>

      <p>Fleetwood Mac have scored a laundry list of achievements over their impressive career. Grammy Awards, massive commercial success and a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction are just a few of the band’s many impressive feats. Still, one accomplishment that alludes them is a performance on 'Saturday Night Live.' Though Fleetwood Mac have never appeared on the series, several of the band’s members have performed as solo artists. That was the case for Stevie Nicks, who took to the 'SNL' stage in support of her 1983 solo effort, ‘The Wild Heart.’ During pitch-perfect performances of “Stand Back” and “Nightbird,” the songstress displayed poise and vulnerability. Though it remains her only 'Saturday Night Live' appearance, the singer made sure to leave an indelible mark.</p>

Still, the most memorable moment came during the show’s closing credits. Those who stayed up late to watch the entire episode were treated to a rousing rendition of the band’s debut single, “I Will Follow,” that was so moving, it made 'SNL' cast member Amy Poehler weep like a starstruck teenager.</p>

      <p>Though Bruce Springsteen has been imitated on 'SNL' by the likes of Adam Sandler, Will Forte and Ben Stiller (among others), the Boss has performed on the show only a total of three times. This 2015 performance saw Springsteen and the E Street Band appearing in support of ‘The Ties That Bind: The River Collection,’ a box set of material celebrating the 35th anniversary of the singer’s celebrated 1980 album, ‘The River.’ Springsteen started the 'SNL' set by launching into “Meet Me in the City,” a previously unreleased track from ‘The River’ sessions. Later, he delivered “The Ties That Bind.” Still, the cherry on top of an amazing evening was the performance of “Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town.” The Boss was joined onstage by surprise guest Paul McCartney, along with show hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, for the uplifting holiday classic.</p>

      <p>What are the surefire ways to get banned from a major television show for life? Well, you could drop an f-bomb on live TV, show your bare ass to the audience or leave the production company with a bill for more than $1,000 in damages made to your hotel room. The Replacements did all three in 1986, in what was the Minneapolis band’s first appearance on television. The alt-rock pioneers went on the have a highly influential career, but their 'SNL' performance remains a thing of infamy.</p>

      <h4>Rage Against the Machine: April 13, 1996</h4>
      <p>In one of the strangest show host/musical guest pairings, 'SNL' thought it wise to have Republican billionaire presidential hopeful Steve Forbes on the same show as politically charged liberal rockers Rage Against the Machine. The band elected a relatively innocuous form of protest, hanging an upside down U.S. flag over their amp. The flag was spotted by a 'Saturday Night Live' stagehand, with angry staff members removing it moments before the band’s first performance of the night. There would be no second song. As soon as Rage Against the Machine were done with their powerful rendition of “Bulls on Parade,” they were notified by producers that they had been banned from the show. Still, their lone song remains one of the hardest hitting performances in 'SNL’'s history.</p>

      <h4>Devo: October 14, 1978</h4>
      <p>Devo’s debut album, 'Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!,' came out only a few months before their 'Saturday Night Live' debut. Their appearance was less about the band’s appeal (they were still building a fan base) and more about their manager, Elliott Roberts. 'SNL' producer Lorne Michaels had originally passed on Devo, but Roberts got him to reconsider by promising another client, Neil Young, for a future show. So the stage was set for Devo’s late-night debut and, true to their quirky persona, the band chose to cover the Rolling Stone’s “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” as its first number. The cover had become a hit in the U.K., though American audiences had yet to embrace it. Sure enough, the audience at 30 Rock seemingly didn’t know what to make of this new wave group, decked out in yellow biohazard suits. Though the performance was met with an awkward spattering of applause, it introduced Devo to millions of viewers.</p>

      <h4>Red Hot Chili Peppers: May 6, 2006</h4>
      <p>Red Hot Chili Peppers’ first 'SNL' appearance was in 1992. That tension-filled performance featured uncomfortable exchanges between singer Anthony Kiedis and guitarist John Frusciante, including Frusciante purposefully changing the rhythm and key of “Under the Bridge” without any warning. Rather than dwelling on this inauspicious 'SNL' debut, we’ll look to the the band’s 2006 appearance. Performing in support of their ‘Stadium Arcadium’ double album, the Chili Peppers tore through rousing renditions of “Dani California” and “Give it Away." There was no feuding or sabotage this time around. Instead, viewers were treated to a high-powered performance from music’s foremost funk-rockers.</p>

      <h4>Sting: January 19, 1991</h4>
      <p>Sting has been a four-time musical guest on 'Saturday Night Live,' but arguably his most memorable appearance on the show came in 1991. That night, the former Police frontman did double duty, acting as both the host and musical guest. Though the musician has sometimes been characterized as taking himself too seriously, Sting showed off a welcoming sense of humor throughout the evening. In one sketch, he was stuck in an elevator with super-fans Kevin Nealon and Dana Carvey, who think it’s a great idea to (poorly) sing some of Sting’s greatest hits. Later, Sting delivers a dead-on impression of fellow British rocker Billy Idol in a bit based on political roundtable program 'The McLaughlin Group.' Still, Sting's greatest contributions came during the musical numbers. An opening performance of his hit song “All This Time” got the evening started on a high note, while a cover of “Purple Haze” reminded all those watching that the singer still knew how to rock out.</p>

      <h4>Billy Idol : January 28, 1984</h4>
      <p>This was everything fans want in a Billy Idol performance. The spiky, bleached-blonde hair, tattered leather vest without a shirt underneath and trademark lip-snarl were all in full effect. And, of course, the energy was unrelenting. For his first number, Idol delivered a fist-pump-inducing rendition of his 1982 hit song “White Wedding.” He’d follow later with “Rebel Yell,” delivering an explosive version that had the singer screaming at some parts and writhing on the floor at others.</p>

      <p>The otherworldly synth sounds. Indulgent instrumental interludes. David Byrne’s unnerving blank stare. Talking Heads’ 'Saturday Night Live' debut was equal parts impressive and weird - but we’re pretty sure that’s how the band likes it! With their one-of-a-kind interpretation of Al Green's classic "Take Me to the River," followed later by the swirling sounds of “Artists Only,” Talking Heads announced their arrival as one of their generation’s most experimental acts.</p>

      <h4>The Kinks: February 26, 1977</h4>
      <p>By its second season, 'Saturday Night Live' had already seen its share of turnover. Standout cast member Chevy Chase departed just six episodes into Season Two. The Muppets, who briefly had a recurring segment on the show, were also gone. Such instability left many on the show nervous, but the musical guests continued to provide some stable ground to the fledgling program. Such was the case with the Kinks, the well-established rockers who’d already scored a bevy of hits before their appearance on 'SNL.' For its first song, the group delivered a tight medley of many of its best-known tunes, including “You Really Got Me,” “All Day and All of the Night,” “A Well Respected Man” and “Lola.” Later, a complete rendition of the band’s 1977 single “Sleepwalker” rounded out the performance.</p>

Them Crooked Vultures, the supergroup that brought these three legendary musicians together, was riding a wave of hype before their 2010 'Saturday Night Live' appearance. Their self-titled debut album had been released two months earlier, with lead single “New Fang” peaking at No. 10 on the alternative rock chart. Their performance on 'SNL' was tight, powerful and dynamic - everything you’d expect from three of rock’s biggest names.</p>

      <p>When Mick Jagger was invited to be the host and musical guest for 2012’s 'SNL' season finale, the Rolling Stones frontman decided to make it a night to remember. To do so, he invited a handful of rock’s biggest names to appear with him throughout the show. Arcade Fire and Nikolai Fraiture of the Strokes joined him for a performance of the early Stones single “The Last Time.” Later, the Foo Fighters guested on “19th Nervous Breakdown” and “It’s Only Rock ‘n Roll (But I Like It).” Guitarist Jeff Beck also made an appearance, sitting in on the blues song “Tea Party.” Throughout the parade of rock stars, Jagger played grand marshal, delivering his usual high standard of energy and swagger. Still, the night’s biggest moment was arguably the final tune, as a performance of “She’s a Rainbow” and “Ruby Tuesday” soundtracked a poignant goodbye to 'SNL' cast member Kristen Wiig.</p>

      <p>Somewhat surprisingly, Cheap Trick have made only one visit to 'Saturday Night Live.' Original bassist Tom Petersson had departed the group, replaced momentarily by Pete Comita. Their 'SNL' appearance came in support of ‘All Shook Up,’ the band’s experimental 1980 LP that left many critics and fans disappointed. Still, that didn’t stop the band from delivering an emphatic performance on the late-night stage, with rousing renditions of 'Baby Loves to Rock’ and 'Can't Stop It but I'm Gonna Try' satiating fans both in the studio and watching at home.</p>

      <p>The White Stripes breakthrough album, 2001’s ‘White Blood Cells,’ launched the garage-rock duo from indie obscurity to national stardom. Their appeal wasn’t lost on 'SNL' producers, who booked the group for the third episode of their 28th season. Donning their standard red, white and black color combo, Jack and Meg White tore through a ferocious performance of “Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground.” Later, the duo turned things down for a more subdued delivery on “We Are Going to Be Friends.” It was the lone performance by the White Stripes on 'SNL,' with Meg retiring from music in 2011 due to issues with anxiety. Jack, meanwhile, has continued his prolific career. He returned to the 'Saturday Night Live' stage in 2012 to perform tracks from his solo album, ‘Blunderbuss.’</p>

      <p>The Cure’s unique blend of New Wave sound and goth style scored the band international acclaim in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. Given their vaunted stature in pop culture, it's surprising that 'SNL' bookers waited until 1996 to get the group on the show. By then, the future Rock and Roll Hall of Famers were on their 10th studio album, ‘Wild Mood Swings.’ The band rocked through the LP’s “Mint Car,” before later revisiting their 1985 hit “In Between Days.” All the while, perfectly eye-shadowed frontman Robert Smith delivered his distinctive vocals, demonstrating the eccentric character that helped make the Cure worldwide stars.</p>

      <p>After the massive success of 1994’s Blue Album, followed by the critical acclaim of their second release, ‘Pinkerton,’ Weezer decided to go on a break. The erstwhile rockers disappeared for five years, before reemerging in 2001 with a brand new release. The highly anticipated Green Album hit stores on May 15, 2001. Four days later, the group made its 'Saturday Night Live' debut. Despite the hiatus, the band showed no rust during its 'SNL' performance. The Green Album's lead single, “Hash Pipe,” exploded off the 30 Rock stage, while another of the LP’s tracks, “Island in the Sun,” bounced along at a joyous pace. It was a welcome return for one of alt-rock’s favorite bands. Let’s just ignore the fact that 'SNL' and Matt Damon would lambaste the group in a sketch 17 years later.</p>

The group released only one record, 1984’s ‘The Honeydrippers: Volume One.’ In support of the LP, Plant appeared on 'SNL' for the only time in his career. Backed by an all-star Honeydrippers lineup, including guitarist Brian Setzer and pianist Paul Shaffer, the singer powered through covers of Roy Brown’s “Rockin’ at Midnight” and Elvis Presley’s “Santa Claus Is Back in Town.”</p>

During his appearance, the legendary performer gave fans a taste of both old and new work. His first song, “Leave Virginia Alone,” would be the lead single from his upcoming ‘A Spanner in the Works’ album, while the second performance of the night, “Maggie May,” brought viewers back to one of the singer’s earliest hits. Throughout his appearance, the then 50-year-old Stewart bounced around the stage like a performer half his age. His exuberance was palpable from the evening’s opening note.</p>

      <p>Mellencamp appeared on 'SNL' in support of his 1983 album, ‘Uh-Huh,’ the first release on which he used his real last name. Someone at NBC must not have gotten the memo, as the rocker was still billed as “John Cougar” for this performance. No matter. The feathered-haired Mellencamp still provided exuberant versions of “Pink Houses” and “Crumblin’ Down,” two of the LP’s standout tracks. Backing singers decked out like cheerleaders helped drive home Mellencamp’s all-American charm.</p>

      <h4>R.E.M.: April 13, 1991</h4>
      <p>Part of what made this 1991 performance by R.E.M. shine was its unpredictability. Yes, everyone expected to hear “Losing My Religion,” the hit single that was already topping charts the world over. But for their second song, the group opted to go with “Shiny Happy People,” an upbeat track that seemingly went against the band’s subdued reputation. Add in the wacky dance moves of frontman Michael Stipe (along with the B-52’s Kate Pierson on backing vocals) and you had a surprisingly giddy performance. It also helps that “Shiny Happy People,” though a departure for R.E.M., was a very catchy track. It was released as a single several months after the 'SNL' appearance, eventually peaking within the Top 10.</p>

      <h4>Green Day: December 3, 1994</h4>
      <p>Eleven months after the album ‘Dookie’ catapulted Green Day from Bay Area punks to worldwide superstars, Billy Joe Armstrong, Trey Cool and Mike Dirnt made their first visit to 'SNL.' The trio performed the songs “When I Come Around” and “Geek Stink Breath” during their appearance. While blazing through the latter, Armstrong said the word “shit,” apparently missed by the censor. The curse word made it to air, though it was later censored during reruns.</p>

      <h4>Lindsey Buckingham: February 6, 1982</h4>
      <p>Having already scored massive worldwide success as part of Fleetwood Mac, Lindsey Buckingham released his first solo record, ‘Law and Order,’ in October 1981. He stuck to the album’s material during this 1982 'SNL' appearance, delivering the LP’s lead single, and most successful song, “Trouble,” during his first performance of the night. Later, Buckingham rocked the 'SNL' stage with his upbeat, quirky album cut “Bwana.” His supporting band that evening included Fleetwood Mac bandmate Christine McVie, along with Billy Burnette, Steve Ross and George Hawkins - all of whom would go on to make up Mick Fleetwood’s Zoo.</p>

      <h4>Linkin Park: May 12, 2007</h4>
      <p>This was the first of Linkin Park’s two 'Saturday Night Live' appearances. While it’s somewhat surprising that bookers didn’t have the band on sooner, considering the massive mainstream success of its first two albums, Linkin Park wasted little time in blowing the roof off of the 30 Rock studio. An explosive performance of “What I’ve Done” was followed later in the show by a frenetic rendition of “Bleed It Out.” Throughout both songs the band delivered the energy, emotion and haunting lyrics that helped make it one of the 2000’s biggest acts.</p>

      <p>Add the Eagles to the short list of iconic acts that have somehow never graced the 'SNL' stage. Though he didn’t appear with his revered classic rock band, Don Henley did perform as the musical guest in this season 15 episode. The singer was there to promote his third solo effort, ‘The End of Innocence.’ His first song that night was “The Last Worthless Evening,” the soaring ballad rumored to be inspired by Michelle Pfeiffer. Henley followed with a crowd favorite, 1984’s hit single “The Boys of Summer.”</p>

      <h4>Queens of the Stone Age: May 14, 2005</h4>
      <p>After a seven-year run as a 'Saturday Night Live' cast member Will Ferrell left the show in 2002. He returned three years later to host for the first time. That night’s musical guest was Queens of the Stone Age, promoting their fourth studio LP, ‘Lullabies to Paralyze.’ The album’s lead single was a track called “Little Sister,” which just happened to have a notable cowbell rhythm. So the stage was set for Ferrell to revisit his memorable “More Cowbell” sketch, thumping the instrument onstage while Queens of the Stone Age performed. What’s better than seeing Queens of the Stone Age performing on 'SNL'? Seeing Queens of the Stone Age performing on 'SNL' with Will Ferrell on cowbell.</p>

      <h4>Korn: November 19, 2005</h4>
      <p>Sure, this performance felt seven years too late. An appearance in support of 1998’s mammoth hit album ‘Follow the Leader’ would have caught Korn at their highest of highs. Still, a decade of MTV relevance and more than 30 million albums sold worldwide earned the nu-metal rockers their lone moment on the 'SNL' stage. The group powered through “Twisted Transistor,” the lead singer from its 2005 LP ‘See You on the Other Side,’ before a high-octane performance of “Freak on a Leash” later in the show.</p>
