      <h1>Lebanon's Safadi withdraws from PM race</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:47:12+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:47</time> by <a rel="author">COMPILED FROM WIRE SERVICES</a></address>
      <p>Former Lebanese Finance Minister Mohammad Safadi withdrew Saturday his candidacy to be the country's next prime minister, saying he saw that it would have been difficult to form a "harmonious" cabinet supported by all parties.</p>
      <p>Safadi, in a statement, said he hoped outgoing Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri would be designated again for the post. Hariri quit on Oct. 29 in the face of unprecedented protests.</p>
      <p>As a former member of parliament from the majority Sunni northern city of Tripoli, Safadi rose as a candidate following Lebanese media's and political sources' announcements that three major parties had agreed to support him for the post.</p>
      <p>Last Thursday night saw thousands of protesters take the streets of capital Beirut, shortly after the media announced Safadi's nomination as Lebanon's next prime minister.</p>
      <p>Although there was no official confirmation of his nomination, demonstrators gathered in front of one of his properties in his hometown of Tripoli to protest.</p>
      <p>The government has stayed on in a caretaker capacity since Hariri stepped down.</p>
      <p>Safadi has had close relations with the Saudi royal family and he left Lebanon in 1975 for the kingdom to build a business empire in the construction sector.</p>
