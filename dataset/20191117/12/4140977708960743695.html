                            <p>Danilo and Ronaldo played at Real Madrid together before he moved to Manchester City. Danilo was picked up by Juventus this summer as part of a deal that saw Joao Cancelo move to the other direction. Despite his short stay at the Spanish capital, he has no regrets choosing Real Madrid over Barcelona.</p>
                            <p><i>“I must confess, at some point I had to stop and think about it,” </i>Danilo said of the transfer dilemma he faced in 2015.</p>
                            <p>
                              <i>“Barcelona has shown a lot of interest, so I called my dad and asked him, ‘Pop, if it was you, where would you go?’. And he answered, ‘If it was me, I’d go to Madrid. They look like a more serious club [to work for]’.</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <i>“And, taking his life perspective into consideration, I thought, ‘Well, this helps a lot’.</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <i>“Then we settled that I was going there. And it was very nice, it was a very pleasant experience.”</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>Coming back to Ronaldo, Portugal now have a strong young squad; One that will only get better with time. If only Ronaldo had these players during his prime. However, an ageing Ronaldo will want to make the best out of the few years he has left and the outstanding squad he has around him in the upcoming Euro 2020 and if his body permits; World Cup 2022.</p>
