      <p>MADURAI Dalit rights activists have condemned the recent alleged torture of a section of residents of the Scheduled Caste community from Ambedkar Colony of Oomachikulam.</p>
      <p>A 15-year-old-boy, was allegedly picked up by Oomachikulam police on November 4 on the pretext of interrogation after some people stole four iron rods used in the construction of the elevated highway at Oomachikulam. “The last time I saw my son was on November 5. After that his whereabouts are unknown,” said K. Sumathi, his mother.</p>
      <p>Advocate A. Rajini, while addressing a press conference here on Saturday, said that she would file a habeas corpus petition in the High Court seeking a direction to the police to produce the boy. The residents also alleged that a few others were picked up by the police for inquiry and tortured. They also said that they paid money and jewellery to the police to be released after interrogation.</p>
      <p>Ms. Rajini said that appropriate action should be taken against the police. R. Adhiyaman, founder-president, Adi Tamizhar Peravai, was also present.</p>
