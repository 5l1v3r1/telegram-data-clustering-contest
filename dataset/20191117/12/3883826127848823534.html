        <b>Hundreds of bikers have gathered to ride in memory of Harry Dunn, the teenager whose crash death led to a diplomatic row with the US.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Harry, 19, died after the collision in Northamptonshire in August that led to suspect Anne Sacoolas leaving the UK claiming diplomatic immunity.</p>
      <p>A file <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-50263769">has been passed to prosecutors</a>, but no charges have been brought.</p>
      <p>Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said support from the public was "the only thing keeping us going".</p>
      <p>Harry's father Tim said the support from those who took part in the motorbike and scooter ride, which started in Brackley, Northamptonshire, was "fantastic".</p>

      <p>Talking to Sky News, Mrs Charles said decisions in the case by the Crown Prosecution Service were "taking too long".</p>
      <p>"The case is a pretty clear cut, we are just waiting on their decision," she added.</p>
      <p>Harry was fatally injured on 27 August, when his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Mrs Sacoolas, 42, outside RAF Croughton, where her husband Jonathan was an intelligence officer.</p>

      <p>Mr Dunn, who explained the family was "struggling", said: "We are getting more frustrated by the delays and the authorities."</p>
      <p>Mrs Sacoolas left the UK claiming diplomatic immunity, but was interviewed by Northamptonshire Police <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-50249290">in the US last month</a>.</p>

      <p>Mrs Clinton also said a meeting at the White House between Harry's family <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-50064595">and President Trump</a>, where Mrs Sacoolas was in the next room, had been "clumsy and heavy-handed".</p>
      <p>Mr Dunn said his hoped Mrs Clinton's comments would "help push forward" the chance of Mrs Sacoolas return to the UK.</p>
