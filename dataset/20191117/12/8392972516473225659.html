      <p>One of the reviews read: "Great stuff, it's fab for helping clear out your kid's nose when they have a cold. It smells exactly like vapour rub. Yeah, not normally what you would want to bath in but it helps clear mucus and that is the purpose. For those who want ones to help their kids relax, try the purple one with lavender."</p>
      <p>Another who wasn't a fan complained that it smelled like "pine toilet cleaner", which they felt took away from the point of having a bubbly bath.</p>
      <p>But another customer wrote in their review on the <a href="https://groceries.asda.com/product/baby-bath/asda-little-angels-vapour-bath/910001970269">Asda</a> website: "Not sure why people are complaining that it doesn't smell so nice or doesn't relax you. It's not meant to. It's to unblock snotty noses. If you want a relaxing bath, get the lavender one."</p>
