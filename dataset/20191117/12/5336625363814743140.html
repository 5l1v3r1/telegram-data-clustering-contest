      <p>In the two weeks since <i>Saturday Night Live</i> last aired, there's been only one political circus on pretty much no one's mind, at least <a href="https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1194830580896145408">according to NBC News</a>. So the latest episode of the sketch comedy spiced things up by giving impeachment the soap opera treatment.</p>
      <p>Jon Hamm pops up to help, lending his roguish good looks and natural charm to the role of cooperating witness Bill Taylor. He's joined by former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch (Cecily Strong), star of the past week's proceedings. Also, an addled Rudy Giuliani (Kate McKinnon), disgraced Trump foe Michael Avenatti (Pete Davidson), and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/15/779680446/nfl-is-poised-to-discipline-myles-garrett-for-hitting-steelers-qb-with-his-own-h">suspended</a> NFL player Myles Garrett (Kenan Thompson) for some reason.</p>
      <p>Soap operas don't make sense, and neither does the current state of the U.S. government. A perfect match!</p>
