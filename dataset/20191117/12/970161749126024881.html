      <h1>Nike releases shoes for doctors and nurses for long hospital shifts</h1>

      <p>Our doctors and nurses work hard and they deserve a bit of comfort.</p>
      <p>So Nike has created a range of shoes that are practical and comfortable for long days treating patients.</p>
      <p>The Nike Air Zoom Pulse collection features a laceless, easy clean design with a rubber outsole and a flexible drop-in midsole to make them comfortable to wear for long periods.</p>
      <p>Nike describes the shoes as like a ‘soft, snug hug’ with a coated toe box to protect against any type of spill.</p>
      <p>The traction pattern on the sole means doctors and nurses will have plenty of grip, even if they run into a spill on the floor too.</p>
      <p>They tested the shoes at the OHSU Doernbecher Children’s Hospital in Portland, Oregon.</p>

      <p>They found that the nurses there walk approximately four to file miles and sit for less than an hour during a 12-hour shift so their shoes are important.</p>

      <p>The Nike Air Zoom Pulse is a shoe for everyday heroes: nurses, doctors, home health providers and others who work tirelessly to support patients.</p>
      <p>The six designs have been created by patients at the hospital and all profits from the sale of the shoes will go to OHSU Doernbecher Children’s Hospital.</p>
      <p>Designers include 13-year-old Bransen Fernando, who has kidney cancer, which required a kidney transplant and Desiree Castillo, 12, who has diabetes, celiac disease and depression.</p>
      <p>Zion Thompson, 14, who has Hodgkin lymphoma, Ethan Ellis, 16, who was born with a congenital heart defect resulting in a heart transplant and Kahleah Corona, 11, who has a traumatic brain injury, were also chosen to create a pair of shoes each.</p>
