      <h1>Troy Parrott tipped to lead Ireland against Denmark</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/john-fallon/" target="_blank">By John Fallon</a></address>
      <p>Christian Eriksen is tipping his Tottenham Hotspur teammate Troy Parrott to lead Ireland’s line in tomorrow’s concluding European qualifier.</p>
      <p>Denmark require just a draw to reach the 2020 finals at Ireland’s expense but their talisman Eriksen and manager Age Hareide are wary of Mick McCarthy’s teen wildcard.</p>
      <p>Parrott is considered a long-term replacement at White Hart Lane for unsettled Eriksen and the Dane feels the 17-year-old striker, 10 years his junior, is destined for big things.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow’s concluding Group D game at Lansdowne Road, where shot-shy Ireland require goals to qualify, could be the setting for the teen to play his first minutes of senior competitive.</p>
      <p>Eriksen, who destroyed Ireland’s World Cup ambitions with a hat-trick on his last visit to Dublin two years ago, is certain that Parrott is up to the task.</p>
      <p>“I hope Troy plays as it will be good fun to see him on the pitch,” the 27-year-old said of his clubmate who made his first-team debut in the Carabao Cup in September.</p>
      <blockquote>He has showed in training and games for Spurs that he’s capable of joining in at the highest level. For a player so young, he is a great striker who makes brilliant runs and scores with excellent finishes.</blockquote>
      <p>“Troy is not a shy guy. He stands his ground against defenders. I read that he did very well on his Ireland debut against New Zealand and I expect him to play lots more matches for Ireland and Tottenham.”</p>
      <p>Injury prevented Eriksen making his Dublin return for last year’s meeting of the nations in the UEFA Nations League but subject of Lansdowne Road brings a beaming smile across his face.</p>
      <p>Naturally, he’s not expecting the time of room afforded to him by Ireland in that World Cup play-off which ended 5-1 for the visitors, but the midfielder wants more magic moments.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully, I can make some new fun memories in Dublin,” said the 27-year-old, whose brace in Friday’s 6-0 win over Gibraltar brought his tally to 31 goals in 94 internationals.</p>
      <p>“This will be an intense game. Ireland will probably go with same players who’ve played in the whole campaign. We won’t get many chances, so it’s a case of taking them when they arrive.</p>
      <p>“Ireland are a better team under the new manager. Mick McCarthy has changed the system, which means they’re more aggressive and have more structure to the team.”</p>
