        <b>On Sunday, Barcelona Sporting Director Eric Abidal confirmed the club’s interest in Paris Saint Germain (PSG) superstar Neymar Jr., thereby making it clear that the Brazilian has always been a key target for them.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 27-year-old created quite a storm in the summer of 2017, when he chose to move to PSG from Barcelona. The Parisians had to shell out a world-record €220million to sign him – but things turned south earlier this year, when he expressed interest to return to the Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>And when asked about Neymar in a recent interview, Abidal said: “A top player, who has a Barca philosophy and who is performing at a high level, will always be an option.”</p>
      <p>“From there, at the sport level we can make decisions, but the whole financial issue, there are things that you can reach and others that you cannot.”</p>
      <p>“The future will say,” the ex-France international further added, before concluding:</p>
      <p>“If he continues at this level, because the season is very long, I will not say that it will be option number 1 but it can be a clear option.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <i><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1205517/Barcelona-transfer-news-Neymar-Eric-Abidal-PSG-Antoine-Griezmann-Frenkie-de-Jong-Pique">Express</a></i> reports that Barcelona players were so keen to see Neymar return to the Camp Nou, that they even offered to alter their own contracts – so that it will help the club accommodate his payments as well, in their overall wage budget.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether the Catalans will make a move for him during the upcoming January transfer window.</p>
