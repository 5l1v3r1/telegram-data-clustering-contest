      <p>The Holly Reich Dream Car award – dedicated to the memory of a former WWCOTY panellist – was won by the Porsche Taycan. This award is presented to the judges’ dream car, which they would love to own.</p>
      <p>The finalists for the Woman of Worth Award – introduced in 2018 – included racing driver and television presenter, the late Jessi Combs; Mary Barra (CEO and chairman of General Motors) and Linda Jackson (CEO of Citroën). Citroën’s Jackson was announced as the winner. Addressing the event from France, Jackson said, “Beyond my person I believe that it rewards the success of Citroën's renewal, which I have undertaken for the past five years with my teams, passionate women and men whom I would like to thank warmly. This prize is also theirs! This award also has a very special dimension for me in this year of Citroën's Centenary.”</p>

      <p>The Women’s World Car of the Year Awards came into being in 2009 and has grown every year since. Judges rate cars on the criteria women typically base their car-buying decisions on. Safety, value-for-money, aesthetic appearance, storage space, child-friendliness, ease of driving, colour, sex appeal, and environmental footprint are some of the parameters that the cars are judged on. </p>
      <p>Previous winners of the WWCOTY include the Volvo XC40 in 2018, Hyundai Ioniq in 2017, the Jaguar F-Pace in 2016, Volvo XC90 in 2015, the Mercedes-Benz S-class in 2014 and the Ford Fiesta EcoBoost in 2013.</p>
