      <h1>Weirdest things spotted in Prince Andrew's car-crash Jeffrey Epstein interview</h1>
      <h2>Prince Andrew was subjected to a grilling by Newsnight host Emily Maitlis about his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein in an extraordinary piece of television</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:56:51+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:56</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>The nation watched breathlessly last night as Prince Andrew was eviscerated by Emily Maitlis over his friendship with the dead paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>In an extraordinary piece of television, the Queen's third child stuttered, stumbled and licked his lips as the Newsnight host expertly and calmly grilled him about allegations he'd had sex with the then 17-year-old Virginia Roberts, who claims she was trafficked by Epstein to be a sex slave.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York, who denied dancing with Virginia at upmarket nightclub Tramp <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-didnt-sex-accuser-20897916">because he was at a Pizza Express in Woking</a> at the time, made several baffling claims that had viewers screaming at their TVs.</p>
      <p>Among them were his insistence that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-denies-having-sex-20897365">he couldn't sweat because of a medical condition</a> brought on by "an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War", meaning Virginia's testimony that he was "profusely sweating" while dancing at the club on March 10 2001 couldn't be true.</p>
      <p>Body language experts have been having a field day with the 45 minutes of footage, shot in the south drawing room at Buckingham Palace with full permission from the Queen.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-evasive-heavily-coached-20896677">Psychologist Darren Stanton suggested to the Mirror</a> that Duke's reaction during intense periods of questioning were not consistent with somebody telling the whole truth.</p>
      <p>But viewers picked up even smaller details from the ground-breaking interview and have been left wondering what more could come out of this story.</p>
      <h3>The way his tie was knotted</h3>

        <figcaption>Viewers noted Prince Andrew's tie was crooked, despite there being Buckingham Palace staff on-hand to make him look camera-ready<cite>(Image: Youtube)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The prince's dark blue patterned tie was squeezed into a tight Windsor knot high up against his Adam's apple, and was left curiously skewiff - as though he'd been awkwardly fiddling with it before sitting down with Emily.</p>
      <p>Many viewers couldn't take their eyes off it, with one tweeting: "Watching Prince Andrew interview and all I can think about is why is his tie so squint!!! Driving me insaine.....I know that’s not what I should be thinking About."</p>
      <p>And another wrote: "Did anyone else notice how badly tied his tie was? For someone who never goes out without one, that looked like he’d shoved it back on after P.E. on his way to maths."</p>
      <p>The tie cropped up again during one of Andrew's bizarre explanations as to why he couldn't possibly be the man in the infamous photograph with Virginia, in which he appears to be hugging her around the waist.</p>
      <p>"I don't believe it's a picture of me in London because when I would go out in London, I wear a suit and a tie," he told Emily.</p>
      <p>However, several pictures from Andrew's wild partying days have cropped up on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> - and show him very much not wearing suit jackets or ties.</p>
      <h3>Andrew never uncrossed his legs for the whole interview</h3>

        <figcaption>The duke appeared to keep his legs crossed for the entire duration<cite>(Image: Youtube)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The prince had his left knee crossed over his right leg for what seemed to be the entirety of the interview, and stayed in the same position for every single one of the wider shots.</p>
      <p>Andrew mostly moved his face and hands while answering Emily's questions, and jiggled his suspended left foot in particularly awkward exchanges.</p>
      <p>Maitlis grilled him on the literary agent John Brockman's statement, which claimed he'd seen Andrew receiving a foot massage from a young Russian woman while he was staying in Epstein's New York home during an ill-fated visit in 2010.</p>
      <p>Andrew denied the claim, to which Emily asked: "You’re absolutely sure or you can’t remember?"</p>
      <p>"Yeah, I’m absolutely sure," he said.</p>
      <p>"So John Brockman’s statement is false?" she asked.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't…I wouldn't…I don't know Mr Brockman so I don’t know what he’s talking about," he stumbled.</p>
      <h3>Laughing when Emily said Epstein is dead</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>One of the more unsettling moments of the interview came when the Newsnight host touched upon the death of paedophile Epstein, who was found unconscious in his prison cell in August.</p>
      <p>"Epstein is dead," Emily said.</p>
      <p>"Yes!" Andrew said as he let out a small laugh.</p>
      <p>"The women are now being heard," she continued.</p>
      <p>"Quite rightly."</p>
      <p>One viewer tweeted: "Of the many disturbing elements of the Prince Andrew interview, the half laugh at around 48:30 mins when It’s mentioned that Epstein is dead might b the most frightening. He actually sounds pleased."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "When Emily Maitliss says 'moving on...Epstein is dead.' And Prince Andrew lets out a little laugh when he says 'yes'."</p>
      <h3>Referring to his paedo pal as 'Mr Epstein'</h3>

        <figcaption>Andrew referred to his friend in a manner that could be implied was respectful at least twice<cite>(Image: Youtube)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Despite Emily repeatedly bringing up the surname of the convicted child abuser, Andrew continuously referred to his friend as Mr Epstein throughout the whole interview.</p>
      <p>There's a danger he could be accused of holding his disgraced pal in some regard still.</p>
      <p>Towards the end of their filming, Emily said: "You've talked about a thick skin, I wonder if you have any sense now of guilt, regret or shame about any of your behaviour and your friendship with Epstein?"</p>
      <p>Andrew shot back: "As far as Mr Epstein was concerned, it was the wrong decision to go and see him in 2010. As far as my association with him was concerned, it had some seriously beneficial outcomes in areas that have nothing and have nothing to do with what I would describe as what we’re talking about today."</p>
      <p>He went on: "On balance, could I have avoided ever meeting him? Probably not and that’s because of my friendship with Ghislaine [Maxwell], it was…it was…it was inevitable that we would have come across each other. Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes."</p>
      <p>"Unbecoming? He was a sex offender," noted Emily, her features drawing up in disgust.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, I’m sorry, I’m being polite, I mean in the sense that he was a sex offender," said the prince, throwing up his hands.</p>
      <h3>His eye flickering on the very last shot</h3>

        <figcaption>The prince's eyes flickered from side to side as he ended the interview<cite>(Image: Youtube)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Right at the end of the 45-minute interview, Andrew refused to admit guilt, regret or remorse for his alleged actions.</p>
      <p>And even though Emily gave him the space to sympathise with Epstein's many victims, the prince only spoke of himself - with his eyes flickering across the</p>
      <p>"This interview has been exceptionally rare, you might not speak on this subject again, is there anything you feel has been left unsaid that you would like to say now?" asked Emily.</p>
      <p>"No, I don't think so. I think you've probably dragged out most of what is required and I'm truly grateful for the opportunity that you've given me to be able to discuss this with you," he said.</p>
      <p>"Your Royal Highness, thank you."</p>
      <p>"Thank you very much indeed," added the royal.</p>
      <p>"I'm absolutely no expert but watch this and watch Prince Andrew’s body language. His eyes - he can hardly look at Emily Maitlis," one viewer tweeted.</p>
      <p>"In the final few frames, on the wide shot, watch Prince Andrew’s eyes flicker," said another.</p>
