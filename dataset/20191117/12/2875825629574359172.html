      <p>One man has drowned and another escaped with his life after their car slipped off a pier off the west coast of Ireland.</p>
      <p>The tragic accident occurred on Saturday night on the Island of Arranmore, when a car came off a pier and entered the harbour.</p>
      <p>It is thought that the men may have been trying to turn the car on the pier when it slipped into the sea.</p>
      <p>One man managed to get out of the vehicle but one was left trapped inside.</p>
      <p>It is understood the man who died was a 26-year-old local man and was the driver of the car.</p>
      <p>A full Garda investigation into the cause of the tragedy is underway.</p>
