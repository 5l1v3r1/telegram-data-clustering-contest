      <p>The first-ever strike in Spanish women's top-flight football went ahead on Saturday after failed negotiations for a first collective agreement.</p>
      <p>The players' union (AFE) and clubs' associations (ACFF) were locked in talks for 13 months without success.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Players demanded improved conditions and pay but clubs argued they could not meet the players' terms, claiming they could not afford it and that a consequence would be the disappearance of several teams.</p>
      <p>The indefinite strike, the first since the league's creation in 1988, was voted on by a <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/spain-espw/story/3976143/spanish-first-division-women-footballers-announce-strike-over-improved-rights">majority of players in October</a> and affects the domestic league but not the UEFA Women's Champions League or the national teams.</p>
      <p>The ninth round of the Primera Iberdrola, which is made of 16 clubs, was due to kick off on Saturday with Espanyol hosting Granadilla Tenerife at 1 p.m. local time. Six matches on Sunday were also postponed.</p>
      <p>Despite mediation from the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), Spain's Sports Council (CSD) and the country's ministry of work, all efforts to prevent the strike failed.</p>
      <p>"The footballers have conceded on several issues with the aim of avoiding the strike while the ACFF has shown a stagnancy, without offering alternatives or position solutions to unblock the conflict," read an <a href="https://www.afe-futbol.com/web/noticia-detalle/4117">AFE statement</a>.</p>
      <p>The players' union was <a href="https://www.afe-futbol.com/web/noticia-detalle/comunicado-de-la-asociacion-de-futbolistas-espanoles-12nov">willing to accept</a> on Tuesday a proposal made by the ministry of work for a collective agreement that was hours later turned down by the clubs.</p>
      <p>In that agreement, players were willing to compromise and accept a minimum annual wage of €16,000 and not the €20,000 they originally demanded.</p>
      <p>The biggest stumbling block was whether to consider players as full-time professionals and not employed on a part-time basis, as clubs want.</p>

      <p>Players also want to be covered in the event of an injury and pregnancy.</p>
      <p>An AFE statement said: "Right now they are the only workers in their companies that don't have a collective agreement that protects them like their colleagues, a situation that in the 21st century is incomprehensible."</p>
      <p>The appetite for the women's game has grown in recent years in Spain and sporting results have been good. <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/atletico-madrid/story/3802796/atletico-madrid-vs-barcelona-breaks-world-record-for-womens-club-match">A crowd of 60,739</a> turned up to watch Atletico Madrid host Barcelona in what was a world record for a club match in women's football in March.</p>
      <p>A Spanish club reached the Women's Champions League final for the first time in the 2018-19 campaign with Barcelona progressing to the title game against Olympique Lyon.</p>
      <p>Spain reached the knockout stages of the 2019 World Cup for the first time in their history before being eliminated by USA in the Round of 16.</p>
