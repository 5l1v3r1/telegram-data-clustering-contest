        <i>Director Benjamin Berman is hopelessly out of his depth following a death-defying, meth-addicted comedian</i>
      </p>
      <p>It’s hard to know what kind of story first-time documentary film-maker Benjamin Berman was expecting to tell when he set out to make a film about John Edward Szeles, better known as comedian and magician <a href="https://twitter.com/theamazingj?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">the Amazing Johnathan</a>. The hapless Berman found himself hopelessly out of his depth wrangling Szeles, a terminally ill meth addict with a taste for bandanas and gore, who, despite having been given a year to live in 2014, hauled himself out for a mini-tour of farewell performances in 2017. It would spoil the fun of this shambolic picture – and it’s an enjoyable, dizzying spiral of a story – to give away the film’s revelations. Suffice to say that Berman becomes almost as central a focus in the documentary as Szeles and neither covers himself in glory.</p>
