      <p>HONG KONG, Nov 17 — Home favourite Lee Cheuk-yiu battled to victory over Indonesia’s Anthony Ginting to secure a shock Hong Kong Open win as the city’s pro-democracy protests raged nearby today.</p>
      <p>Lee, 23, came from a game behind and then saw off championship point in a thrilling decider before winning 16-21, 21-10, 22-20 to lift his first major trophy.</p>
      <p>The final took place at the Hong Kong Coliseum, a short distance from the Polytechnic University where a police officer was wounded by a protester’s arrow in the latest fierce clashes.</p>
      <p>The city has been wracked by months of protests including this week’s chaos when major routes and rail services were blocked by masked protesters, bringing parts of the city to a standstill.</p>
      <p>Lee’s title run, which includes surprise wins over Denmark’s Viktor Axelsen and Kidambi Srikanth of India in the quarter- and semi-finals, comes after he appeared to show support for the protesters.</p>
      <p>After winning his opening match, the world number 27 held up an outstretched right hand and his left index finger, a gesture interpreted as supporting ‘Five demands, not one less’—a slogan chanted by the demonstrators.</p>
      <p>“Those who understand will understand, those who don’t, just forget it,” Lee said this week when asked to explain his celebration, according to the South China Morning Post.</p>
      <p>China’s Chen Yufei fought to a hard-won 21-18, 13-21, 21-13 win over Ratchanok Intanon, the former world champion from Thailand, to be crowned the women’s singles champion.</p>
      <p>South Korea’s Choi Sol-gyu and Seo Seung-jae beat Indonesians Mohammad Ahsan and Hendra Setiawan to win the mixed doubles, and China’s Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan saw off Chang Ye-na Kim Hye-rin in the women’s doubles final. — AFP</p>
