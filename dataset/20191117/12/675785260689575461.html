      <h2>Sander Berge is rumoured to be on Liverpool's transfer wish list after impressing against them for Genk in the Champions League. Napoli are also said to be interested</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:53:49+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:53</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Sander Berge has dropped a fresh Liverpool transfer hint by admitting that he wants to play at Anfield "as much as possible".</p>
      <p>Genk midfielder Berge has been linked with a move to the Reds following his eye-catching performances against Jurgen Klopp's men in the Champions League recently.</p>
      <p>The Norway international has scored two goals in 15 Jupiler Pro League in Belgium this season, along with being an ever-present in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>And the 21-year-old has been full of praise for Liverpool and said he wants to make more regular trips to Merseyside.</p>
      <p>"Playing at Anfield is a dream for everyone in the world, and not least for Norwegians," Berge said to TV2.</p>

      <p>"Liverpool are the best team [at the moment] and have the most fans.</p>
      <p>"So I could certainly like to play at Anfield as often as possible."</p>
      <p>Berge has also attracted interest from Napoli, with reports he could leave Genk for a fee of around £18million.</p>
      <p>And sporting director Dimitri De Conde has appeared to fuel speculation Berge could leave the club as he confirmed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> "follow him carefully" as they consider hijacking Napoli's move.</p>

      <p>De Conde told Radio Punto Nuovo: “If Napoli has already blocked Berge? I read it and it’s not like that. Napoli are interested in Sander and it’s is a possibility.</p>
      <p>“We also know Liverpool follow him carefully. Klopp spoke to the boy after the Anfield game, congratulating him on the performance.</p>
      <p>“In Italy there are clubs that follow Berge and Napoli could be one of these, but to date we have no concrete offers on the table. It could even change in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>“Berge to Napoli in January? We don’t know. We are currently fighting for our seasonal goals and we are in a complicated situation.</p>
      <p>“Our intention is to hold on to Sander until the end of the season, but we can’t make any predictions. If the big clubs come knocking at our door, we will have to start negotiations, just as the agent has to do.</p>
      <p>“These are situations we can’t predict, we’re focused on our season, hoping to keep Sander until May. Then if a top club like Napoli is serious, we will sit at the same table to negotiate, it is logical.</p>
      <p>“The current valuation of Berge? We do not talk about figures; we do not set a price at the moment. We will see when we find ourselves in a negotiation.”</p>
