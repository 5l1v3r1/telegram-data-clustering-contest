      <h1>Arsenal 'contact Reinier's father' in bid to seal transfer of next Gabriel Martinelli</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal are one of a number of clubs to register an interest in Brazil and Flamengo teenager Reinier, who has a release clause of £60m</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:20:14+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:20</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal have reportedly contacted teenager Reinier Jesus' father over a move to north London.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old only made his Flamengo debut in July but has already attracted interest from a host of top European clubs.</p>
      <p>Paris Saint-Germain, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> are all interested while <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> are believed to have held talks over a possible January deal.</p>
      <p>But Mundo Deportivo reports <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> have contacted his father, who made a trip to Europe to look at potential clubs for the teenager.</p>
      <p>Reinier's asking price has doubled in recent months, with Flamengo having been looking for just £17m in the summer.</p>

      <p>Arsenal hope their deal to sign Gabriel Martinelli could work in their favour in their attempt to sign Reinier.</p>
      <p>Martinelli moved to the Emirates from Brazilian side Ituano in the summer and has enjoyed a fine start to life in England.</p>
      <p>He has managed seven goals already in cup competitions and has impressed boss Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>Reinier only signed a new deal with Flamengo this month and it is believed they have inserted a release clause of £60m (€70m) in the contract.</p>

      <p>There has been speculation in recent weeks that Atletico Madrid have contacted the Brazilian side over a potential deal but have been put off by the asking price.</p>
      <p>Reinier is keen to move to Europe, and said: "It’s an honour that Atlético are interested in me because they are a huge club.</p>
      <p>“It’s another honour to know that one of the biggest clubs in the world is watching me.</p>
      <p>"But I’m a Flamengo player and my objective is to keep doing a good job here to win many titles in Brazil.”</p>
