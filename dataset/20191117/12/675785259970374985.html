      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>Did a dinner party really secure a US bailout of the UK economy in the 1960s?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-crown">The Crown</a> season 3 on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> sees a royal trip to the United States with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/princess-margaret">Princess Margaret</a> (<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/helena-bonham-carter">Helena Bonham Carter</a>) and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/antony-armstrong-jones">Antony Armstrong-Jones, Earl of Snowdon</a> (<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ben-daniels">Ben Daniels</a>) travelling around American states and securing a wave of positive press for the Royal Family.</p>
      <p>However, the trip becomes more serious when <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-queen">The Queen</a> (<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/olivia-colman">Olivia Colman</a>) asks Margaret to attend a dinner with the stubborn US President, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lyndon-b-johnson">Lyndon B Johnson</a> (<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/clancy-brown">Clancy Brown</a>).</p>
      <p>The hope is that Margaret can smooth over US-UK relations and perhaps save the UK economy by securing a huge bailout for UK.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, Margaret's White House visit sees Johnson utterly charmed, the bailout secured, and the UK economy saved.</p>
      <p>But was the trip such a success in real life?</p>

      <p>Despite the series suggesting that Princess Margaret's 1965 trip to the US was a resounding success, it was actually highly controversial and saw a lot of negative press for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/royal-family">Royal Family</a> in the UK.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4189787/Jet-set-friends-got-Princess-Margaret-barred-from-US.html">The Telegraph,</a> Princess Margaret managed to offend a number of US celebrities while in the country, having verbal clashes with stars such as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/judy-garland">Judy Garland</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/grace-kelly">Grace Kelly.</a></p>
      <p>The headlines in Britain about the trip were more concerned with the high costs of the trip at the tax payer's expense and the "jet-set" lifestyle that the Snowdons were enjoying.</p>
      <p>The US ambassador at the time, Sir Patrick Dean, wrote: "They worked and played hard.</p>
      <p>"It was a mistake that so much of their time was spent with and organised by Miss Sharman Douglas, though she did her best, after her own fashion, to make sure the visitors had a gay and amusing time.</p>
      <p>"However, the keynote was the 'jet set' and it was not always possible to persuade the public that HRH and Lord Snowdon were serious as well as gay people."</p>

      <p>The tension brought about by her hedonistic time in the US seems to have seen her barred from visiting for years afterwards.</p>
      <p>However, the reception in the US was much better.</p>
      <p>In his toast at his dinner with Princess Margaret, President Johnson said: "Your coming has been very good for us. You have reminded us that we are a young nation and a gay people who respond to the smile and the warmth of a young couple."</p>
      <p>He added: "You have claimed our heart, and we are very proud to give it to you."</p>
      <p>Johnson also explained: "Your travels throughout our land - in the company of a large number of the press - have helped our balance of payments problem."</p>

      <p>The President also commended Margaret's "dignity and grace" and said that she had "represented well" the British public.</p>
      <p>"Everywhere you have gone in the United States you have encountered an affectionate warmth of feeling and a very friendly interest on the part of the American people," proclaimed Johnson. "This has been both a tribute to Your Royal Highness and to Lord Snowdon and, through you, it has been an expression of all the American people for Great Britain."</p>
      <p>While there is not an overwhelming amount of evidence to suggest that Margaret fixed an economic crisis, Johnson even referring to the payments issue in his toast to her suggests her visit went a some way to solidifying the special relationship between the US and UK.</p>
      <p>The reports don't quite suggest as raucous an evening as depicted in the series, however!</p>
