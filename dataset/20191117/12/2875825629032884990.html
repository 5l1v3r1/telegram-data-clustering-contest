      <h1>First look at horrendously over-budget HD EastEnders set including the new Queen Vic</h1>
      <h2>The bill for the rebuild of the soap's HQ is costing a further £27m and four years longer than initially planned</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:38:54+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:38</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/eastenders">EastEnders</a> new HD set is finally taking shape along with a first look at the square's iconic Queen Vic.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/drone-shots-reveal-eastenders-87m-14109281">Drone snaps</a> taken of the E20 project in Elstree, Herts show the famous <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/bbc-took-weeks-choose-bricks-13930168">red bricks</a> are perfectly intact and will mean fans probably won't be able to spot a difference on screen.</p>
      <p>Along with the pub progress has also been made on a block of luxury flats to make Walford, a fictional East End town, a little more modern.</p>
      <p>Builders have also been busy creating a replica of the railway line which has hosted many a dramatic character exits over the decades.</p>
      <p>The new set, which is just a few metres away from the current one at Elstree, will feature a new front lot to resemble the original set and a back lot designed to reflect London streets.</p>

      <p>This to allow the soap to be filmed in high definition and will reportedly save the BBC £500,000 a year.</p>
      <p>However the new soap HQ which first began building in 2015, is considerably behind schedule.</p>
      <p>It is costing license fee payers <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/eastenders-chaos-bbc-chiefs-blow-14159898">an extra £27m</a> and four years longer than planned.</p>

      <p>It was revealed last year that it would now cost £86.7million - a 45 per cent increase from its original £59.7million budget.</p>
      <p>In the original plans, set out in 2013, bosses said the HD set would be finished in 2019.</p>
      <p>But this was later pushed back to 2020 and later delays mean some areas now won’t be finished until 2023.</p>
      <p>The BBC previously said in a statement: “The set of EastEnders was built in 1984 and only intended for use for two years.</p>

      <p>"Over 30 years later, the show remains one of the BBC’s flagship programmes and yet is filming from a set that is no longer fit for purpose.</p>
      <p>“The new set will be suitable for HD filming for the first time and extend Walford to better reflect modern East End London.</p>
      <p>“It’s a large, complex project which has already delivered many other vital improvements at BBC Elstree Centre, but like any building work of this scale there have been challenges on the way, including construction market issues beyond our control and from working on a brownfield site.</p>
      <p>“As the NAO recognises, we’ve already made improvements and are keeping the project under close scrutiny.”</p>
