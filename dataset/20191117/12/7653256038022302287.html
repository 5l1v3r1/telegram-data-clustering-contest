      <p>MUMBAI: A day after Rajneet Singh, son of former BJP MLA <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sardar-Tara-Singh">Sardar Tara Singh</a>, was arrested in connection with the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank scam, the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the city police on Sunday conducted a search at his residence here, an official said.</p>
      <p>Before the search, Rajneet Singh, who is a director of the scam-hit bank, was produced before a court here, which remanded him in police custody till November 25.</p>
      <p>"After producing Singh in the court, a team of around four officials took him to his flat in Karmashetra Building in Sion Koliwada area and conducted a search there. They were there for over an hour. Singh's family members were asked to wait outside the building during the search," an EOW official said.</p>
      <p>"But what has been recovered and seized from the flat is yet to be known," he added.</p>
      <p>With the arrest of Rajneet Singh, total nine persons have been arrested in connection with the alleged Rs 4355- crore scam, including three top bank officials and two promoters of HDIL --Rakesh and Sarang Wadhawan, and auditors.</p>
      <p>Besides being a director, Rajneet Singh is a member of the loan recovery committee of the bank.</p>
      <p>The EOW suspects a nexus between some of the accused and the realty group HDIL, whose mammoth loan defaults are said to have caused a liquidity crisis at the bank, leading to appointment of an administrator by the RBI and restrictions on withdrawal of funds.</p>
      <p>The EOW had earlier told a sessions court that prima facie a nexus between some of the accused and HDIL group companies has been made out by the investigators who suspected a "deep-rooted conspiracy".</p>
