      <h1>Katie Hopkins on having to sell £1m Devon home and renting after libel case</h1>
      <h2>She has spoken for the first time about selling her Exeter mansion</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:41:02+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:41</time> by <a rel="author">Emmeline Saunders, Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>Katie Hopkins says she was forced to sell her £1m Devon home and now rents after a court case wiped out her finances.</p>
      <p>The controversial celebrity had to flog her luxury five-bedroom mansion on <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/katie-hopkins-house-jack-monroe-1091445">Magdalen Road in Exeter last year</a> to pay off  a £500,000 legal bill after the writer Jack Monroe sued her for libel and won.</p>
      <p>Hopkins has now spoken about her ordeal, as she now rents out a house with her husband and children, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/katie-hopkins-forced-sell-1m-20899416">The Mirror</a> reports.</p>
      <p>She spoke to The Sunday Times, claiming that speaking her mind lost her her career - having compared migrants crossing the Mediterranean in dinghies to "cockroaches" and also saying she'd use gunships to prevent people from landing on European shores.</p>

      <p>"I live in a rented, modern, four-bedroom detached house with my husband Mark and our three children, aged 15, 14 and 10," she said.</p>
      <p>"It's tucked out of the way for security reasons - our last home was rigged up to the local police station and had panic alarms fitted because of threats I received to my life.</p>
      <p>"I was forced to sell it for £950,000 in early 2018 to pay off a legal bill in excess of £500,000."</p>
      <p>While she didn't apologise for the circumstances leading up to the 2017 legal case - she'd falsely accused poverty campaigner Jack Monroe of vandalising a war memorial - Hopkins did express regret that she hadn't acted sooner to settle the case out of court.</p>

      <p>Asked what her worst business decision had been, she said: "Arguably, not settling the legal case brought against me.</p>
      <p>"I could have settled by giving £5,000 to a migrant charity but chose not to, and the ensuing court action and legal bills  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/katie-hopkins-secretly-forced-file-13254535">forced me to apply for an individual voluntary arrangement</a>  ."</p>
      <p>And she claimed she learned nothing from being on The Apprentice in 2007, adding: "I 100% did not. However, I did learn that at the start of a recruitment process it's best to keep your mouth shut, listen and learn where you fit in - and only then have your say."</p>
      <p>Earlier this month,<a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/katie-hopkins-slams-plan-scrub-3496248"> Katie lashed out at the decision</a> to have Bideford's 'Little White Town' nickname  <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/devons-little-white-town-description-3490811">removed from its signposts</a> , describing the move as 'madder than a syphilitic cat'.</p>

      <p>Bideford takes its 'Little White Town' moniker from Charles Kingsley's  book Westward Ho!, which was written in 1855 and set in and around the area.</p>
      <p>But town councillor and former mayor Dermot McGeough tabled a motion on Thursday night's town council meeting which called to scrap the name from signs in the town following complaints.</p>
      <p>Katie, who grew up in the North Devon town, took to Twitter to voice her disgust at the move.</p>
      <p>"This is my town. Where I grew up. Where I waitressed in the Wimpy for £1.40 an hour serving Bender in a Bun. Where I weighed Pick n’ Mix at Woolworths. Where I was taught by nuns," tweeted the 44-year-old.</p>
      <p>"It will ALWAYS be The Little White Town.  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bideford?src=hashtag_click">#Bideford</a></p>
      <p>"This country is madder than a syphilitic cat."</p>
