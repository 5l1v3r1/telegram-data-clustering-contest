      <p>She said the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit had officers on standby to attend to cases of rape as soon as they were reported.</p>
      <p>"The case was prioritised and duly treated with urgency, only to establish that the case was based on a fabricated story," she said.</p>
      <p>"Preliminary investigation confirmed that the complainant opened a false rape case."</p>
      <p>She was arrested and expected to appear in court soon for perjury.</p>
      <p>Peters warned people to refrain from opening false rape cases as it diverted resources from genuine cases.</p>
      <p>"In the same tone, police are appealing to victims of rape not to be silent but report as soon as possible."</p>
