      <p>“Unethical” fees charged by GPs for patients needing a doctor’s letter to support their benefits claims have been slammed by city politicians.</p>
      <p>Councillors have pledged to investigate the problems faced by some of Newcastle’s poorest residents because of the charges from GP practices.</p>
      <p>Newcastle City Council’s health scrutiny committee heard on Thursday that some surgeries are charging patients a fee, reportedly up to £30, to obtain a form confirming their medical status to assist with claims for benefits such as Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).</p>
      <p>After the meeting, Kenton councillor Stephen Lambert called the payments “unethical and a disgrace”.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘’Charging the most vulnerable, many of whom suffer long-term physical and mental health related illnesses, is nothing short of a disgrace. It’s another ‘indirect tax’ on the poorest members of our community. It must cease.’’</p>
      <p>He called on practices across Tyneside to produce the letters free of charge.</p>
      <p>West Fenham councillor Sylvia Copley said the issue was “really concerning”, particularly as she had been told many GPs’ letters are not detailed enough to help benefit claimants’ cases.</p>
      <p>She said: “The people who need those letters are people who have no money.</p>
      <p>“The other concern we have had evidence of is that some of the letters are literally half a dozen lines, or even three lines. It is not a comprehensive report in terms of the medical conditions someone might have and may be of benefit for a judge or an assessor to understand.”</p>
      <p>The health scrutiny committee agreed to establish a group to investigate the scale of the problem in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Eugene Milne, the city’s director of public health, said: “This is not a defence in any way, but I think they [GPs] are acting in line with their contracted status rather than doing something which is technically out of line.</p>
      <p>“I think it is inappropriate, personally. But we need to think about how those fees would be paid in a different way.</p>
      <p>“Filling in a form does require some work from GPs, who are already immensely stretched.”</p>
      <p>He added that it would be down to individual practices to waive the fees on compassionate grounds, while Coun Ian Tokell said he found it “odd” that the Department for Work and Pensions’ benefit claim process would not pay for the letters.</p>
      <p>NHS England, Newcastle Gateshead CCG, and the British Medical Association were approached for a comment.</p>
