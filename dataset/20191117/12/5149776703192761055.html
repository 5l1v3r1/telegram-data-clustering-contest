      <h1>Violent man attacked woman with hoover and held her head underwater</h1>
      <h2>He even threatened her with an iron</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:26:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:26</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Jarram</a></address>
      <p>A violent offender has been jailed for three years after he carried out a catalogue of abuse.</p>
      <p>Reuben Commons, 22, of no fixed address, was jailed for three years on Tuesday, November 11.</p>
      <p>This follows a trial at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottingham Crown Court.</a></p>
      <p>He was convicted of actual bodily harm after repeatedly punching a woman's body and hitting her with a metal hoover attachment.</p>
      <p>Her head was also held under bath water.</p>
      <p>She was also previously strangled and was threatened with an iron.</p>
      <p>The sentencing relates to an incident on April 2 where Commons assaulted a woman in the early hours at a house in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Bestwood</a>.</p>
      <p>Police said after a period of evading the police, Commons was subsequently located and arrested on October 11, 2018.</p>
      <p>He was subsequently charged with this offence in February 2019.</p>
      <p>Detective Constable Michael Powis, from Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Although this attack was particularly gratuitous, the strong sentence reflects the fact that domestic violence cases are taken seriously both by the police and the courts.</p>
      <p>"The sentence will hopefully give confidence to those who are experiencing domestic violence to seek help from the police."</p>
