      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — The nation’s partisan divide is evident in how Americans believe the struggling local news industry should be propped up.</p>
      <p>A survey by Gallup and the Knight Foundation released on Sunday finds Democrats much more willing than Republicans to see government funding help local news sources.</p>
      <p>The survey finds that more than half of Americans aren’t aware of the crisis in an industry where more than 2,000 newspapers have closed in the last 15 years.</p>
      <p>Six in 10 Americans see newspapers as an important source of civic pride. But many aren’t willing to open their wallets to show the pride. Forty-four percent of people surveyed said they’ve cut off a subscription to a news source within the past five years.</p>
