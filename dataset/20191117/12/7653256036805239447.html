      <p>NEW DELHI: A <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Delhi">Delhi</a> Court has admitted a plea filed by the parents of 2012-gangrape victim, seeking transfer of the case to another judge.</p>
      <p>The victim's parents have sought court's direction to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Tihar-Jail">Tihar Jail</a> authorities to expedite the execution of the rape convicts.</p>
      <p>The court will hear the matter on November 25.</p>
      <p>They moved the application since the earlier two judges hearing the matter got transferred and the matter is getting adjourned continuously, the plea said.</p>
      <p>The special <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/fast-track-court">fast track court</a>, set up to hear cases of sexual harassment cases exclusively, of Patiala House Court is currently vacant and no judge has been appointed till now.</p>
      <p>The application said that victim's parents approached the court since the convicts have exhausted all legal remedies.</p>
      <p>In December last year, the parents of Nirbhaya, the 23-old paramedic who was gang-raped in December 2012, approached the court to fast-track the procedure to hang all four convicts in the case.</p>
      <p>Supreme Court on December 12, 2018, dismissed the PIL seeking a direction to the Centre to execute the death penalty awarded to four convicts -- Mukesh, Pawan, Vinay and Akshay -- in the sensational <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Nirbhaya-gangrape">Nirbhaya gangrape</a> and murder case.</p>
      <p>23-year-old paramedic student was gang-raped on December 16, 2012.</p>
      <p>The victim, who was severely assaulted, succumbed to injuries at <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Mount-Elizabeth-Hospital">Mount Elizabeth Hospital</a> in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Singapore">Singapore</a> on December 29, where she had been airlifted for medical treatment.</p>
