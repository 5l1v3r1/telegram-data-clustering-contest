      <h3>NATIONAL University’s Pep Squad raised the bar of UAAP cheerdance competition several notches higher and was amply rewarded as it made it two in a row with an awe-inspiring performance last night at the Mall of Asia Arena.</h3>
      <p>Paying tribute for all the Filipinos, the Bulldogs were near flawless in the masterful execution of their six-minute run to annex their sixth title in the last seven years with 722 points.</p>
      <p>NU bested Far Eastern University Cheering Squad and Adamson Pep Squad - the same placings as last season in the league’s biggest side event.</p>
      <p>With their signature Scorpion poses, difficult pyramids, and toss execution, the Bulldogs were simply a cut above the rest.</p>
      <p>The Tamaraws, who have 706 points, produced a lively, technically sound Michael Jackson-inspired performance but their efforts were not enough to unseat the Bulldogs.  </p>
      <p>The Falcons also seemed determined in their bid to reclaim the championship two years ago, but some of the errors in their routine did themselves in and finished with 658.5 points.</p>
      <p>University of Santo Tomas Salinggawi Dance Troupe missed the podium anew and settled for fourth place with 650 points, while University of the East placed fifth with 648.</p>
      <p>For the third straight season, University of the Philippines took sixth with 622.5 points.  </p>
      <p>UST and UP share the bragging rights as the most successful cheerdance squads with eight crowns, but has struggled to cope up with NU’s performance this decade.</p>
      <p>Ateneo Blue Babble Battalion (593) and La Salle Animo Squad (577.5) complete the placings.</p>
      <p>NU also emerged triumphant for the second straight year in group stunts, beating FEU and Adamson in the process.</p>
