      <h2>Neco Williams made his Liverpool debut recently.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:15:33+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>Neco Williams scored twice as Wales U19 drew 2-2 with Russia.</p>
      <p>Williams scored in the 66th and 82nd minute, earning Wales a point in U19 Euros qualification. The Welshman twice netted from the penalty spot for his country’s youth team.</p>
      <p>It has been quite a season for Williams, who has shot through the ranks at Anfield. He was not a well-known name at the start of the year but he seems to be impressing the fans as he progresses.</p>

      <p>Jurgen Klopp handed Williams his debut recently in the EFL Cup against Arsenal. The 18-year-old produced an excellent display at Anfield, providing a superb assist for Divock Origi’s injury-time equaliser.</p>
      <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold is Liverpool’s first-choice right-back. But it is clear the future is in good hands with Williams. He continues to shine for the U23s and he has now produced for his national side.</p>
      <p>After Williams netted twice for Wales U19s, Liverpool fans flocked to Twitter to congratulate him and discuss how good he is. Here are some of the best tweets after his international brace.</p>
