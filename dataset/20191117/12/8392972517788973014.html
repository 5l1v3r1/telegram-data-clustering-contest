      <h1>X Factor: Celebrity fans slam Nicole Scherzinger for 'motorboating' Louis Walsh</h1>
      <h2>The X Factor judge put on a raunchy display</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:13:07+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:13</time> by <a rel="author">Entertainment Daily</a></address>
      <p>Nicole Scherzinger was criticised by <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/">X Factor: Celebrity</a> viewers last night after she got very up close and personal with Louis Walsh.</p>
      <p>The talent show judge stood over a seated Louis and pushed her breasts towards his face - and it left viewers less than impressed with her raunchy display.</p>
      <p>Many took to Twitter and said they didn't think the move was appropriate, suggesting there would be uproar if Nicole was a man and had done something similar to a woman.</p>
      <p>One disgruntled viewer <a href="https://twitter.com/Phil_Havercroft/status/1195805016994516992">wrote</a>: "Nobody bats an eyelid at Nicole forcibly motorboating a fellow judge. Just imagine the furore if a male judge thrust his schnangus into her face. It would be career ending. #CelebrityXFactor."</p>

      <p>Another <a href="https://twitter.com/toasksomestuff/status/1195804296920682496">vented</a>: "Why does Nicole always have to be so sexual? Stuffing her boobs in Louis' face #CelebrityXFactor #XFactorCelebrity."</p>
      <p>A third <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=nicole%20%20xfactor%20louis&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">tweeted</a>: "I realise I am probably the only person in on a Saturday watching xfactor but why the [bleep] does Nicole keep sticking her [bleep] in Louis face?"</p>

      <p>And a fourth <a href="https://twitter.com/ellakathrynx/status/1195806608888123393">wrote</a>: "Umm Nicole rubbing her boobs in Louis’ face... is that ok?! Imagine if Louis rubbed his bits on her face! #CelebrityXFactor."</p>

      </p>
      <p>And yet another viewer concluded: "It was a bit too much, it's a kids show."</p>
      <p>Although Louis looked taken aback by the move, it seemed to completely pass by an unaware Simon Cowell, who was seen standing and clapping during the scene.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Nicole, who dated Lewis Hamilton for years, has just been linked to one of X Factor Celebrity's own contestants.</p>
      <p>According to a newspaper report, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/nicole-scherzinger-secretly-dating-x-factor-celebrity-star-thom-evans/">she has been secretly dating rugby play Thom Evans, who is competing in the band Try Star</a>.</p>
      <p>The source claims: "Thom was smitten early on - he’s always said Nicole is one of the most beautiful women in the world. ‘He fancied her long before meeting her on the show.</p>
      <p>"He was initially a bit nervous about starting something up and ruining his chances on the series, but they had great chemistry from the off."</p>
      <p>The source continued: "And after weeks of texting, Thom finally plucked up the courage to ask her out, and took her for dinner."</p>
