      <p>Being a superstar and rich comes with soo many benefits and I think I have to re-evaluate my entire purpose in this world–Perhaps I should dawg this blogging thing and go be some musician or something so I can get the girls–Or you people say ‘hort’?</p>
      <p>At the 2019 MTN 4Syte Music Video Awards, dancehall artiste Shatta Wale walked to the red carpet of the ceremony with Bullet’s artiste, Fantana and he stole all the attention walking with such a beautiful girl.</p>
      <p>It seems the SM Boss seems to have a thing for all of Bullet’s girls–Yeah, from Ebony then to Wendy Shay and now Fantana.</p>
      <p>Wendy Shay was at some awards event far away in Amsterdam because we didn’t see her at the events ground so her almost turned rival, Fantana stole her spot at the red carpet–Soldier go, Soldier come errr?</p>
      <p>In the video, Wale who bagged five awards at the event, in his suit, walked to the red carpet holding the hands of Fantana like he’s been dating her already for the cameras and we must say they kinda looked cute tho.</p>
      <p>Well, now we are even confused as to which of the many girls Shatta Wale really wants to take serious—From Nikki Samonas, Efia Odo, Wendy Shay, and now Fantana.</p>
      <p>Watch the video below but we wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a collaboration soon.</p>
