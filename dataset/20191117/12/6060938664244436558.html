      <p>PUTIAN (China): Arriving with its biggest-ever squad, India will field a shooter in each of the 10 Olympic events in the international shooting federation's season-ending Word Cup Final, beginning on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>The first of the 10 finals are scheduled for Tuesday.</p>

      <p>While world number one Apurvi already has a WCF silver medal to her name, this would be Anjum's first World Cup Final. Anjum, in fact, has qualified to compete in both the women's 10m air rifle and 50m rifle 3 positions (3P) events.</p>
      <p>Sharing her thoughts before leaving for tournament, Anjum said, "I am really excited to be part of the main 3P team again and looking forward to doing well in my first world cup final."</p>
      <p>Also excited was another ISSF WCF debutant Mehuli Ghosh, who has made the cut in the women's 10m air rifle, which will also have Elavenil Valarivan.</p>
      <p>Mehuli said, "After a long time I have got this opportunity to be part of the main team and I am looking forward to do well. The world's best shooters will be there in this competition and it gives me further impetus to finish the year on a high."</p>
      <p>All qualified athletes in the individual events will also be able to take part in the mixed team air rifle and pistol events and then challenge for the President's Trophy.</p>
