      <p>The new air link was confirmed in November 2018 following more than two years of negotiations between the governments of the UK and Argentina.</p>
      <p>When the announcement was made, then-Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said the agreement represented "real progress" for the islands, which were the subject of the 1982 Falklands War.</p>
      <p>Argentina has long staked a claim to the British Overseas Territory, which it refers to as 'Las Malvinas'.</p>
      <p>More than 1,000 British military personnel from all three services are stationed on the islands.</p>

      <p>The Ministry of Defence (MOD) currently operates two weekly flights to and from RAF Brize Norton to the Falkland Islands.</p>
      <p>Civilian passengers can book seats on these flights but the return fare for people who do not live on the islands is £2,222.</p>
      <p>Only one commercial airline route currently serves the islands, with LATAM operating a weekly service to and from Santiago, Chile.</p>
      <p>All of these flights include a stop at the Chilean city of Punta Arenas, while once a month they also stop in Rio Gallegos, Argentina.</p>

      <p>The Falkland Islands government hopes the new air link will lead to an economic boost of more than £2 million each year.</p>
      <p>Barry Elsby, Member of the Falklands Legislative Assembly, said: "This is a huge milestone in realising our goal of improving our global connectivity.</p>
      <p>"Since we first announced the establishment of this new weekly flight, there has been a lot of excitement both at home and abroad, particularly given the opportunities for expanded economic growth and investment."</p>
