      <p>Samsung normally offers only two major OS updates, and the 2017 handset which launched with Android 7.0Â  has already had updates to Android 8.0 in February 2018 and Android 9.0 in February 2019, and is not currently included in the Android 10 beta.</p>
      <p>Today <a href="https://windowsunited.de/samsung-galaxy-s8-android-10-kommt-doch/">WindowsUnited</a>, however, reports that Samsung support has confirmed that an update is in the works for the handset.</p>
