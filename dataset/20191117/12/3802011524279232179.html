      <p>Maximum points would have seen the former champions shoot back to the top of the log, but their performance was nowhere near that of a championship chasing team.</p>
      <p>The stalemate yesterday was their eighth in this campaign.</p>

      <p>They have accumulated 53 points from 31 games and sit a point behind leaders CAPS United.</p>
      <p>CAPS United could, however, increase the lead when they face Yadah at the National Sports Stadium this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Joey Antipas, who doubles up as the national team and Chicken Inn coach, was on the bench for the Gamecocks a day after taking charge of the Warriors in their goalless draw with Botswana.</p>
      <p>His side opened the scoring through a George Majika beauty in the 20th minute.</p>
      <p>Majika’s effort was from the top drawer. The winger unleashed a powerful strike from 25 yards. It left Taimon Mvula, in goal for Hwange, clutching the air.</p>
      <p>It was Hwange, however, who would enjoy a good spell after that goal.</p>
      <p>The visitors, through veterans Felix Chindungwe and Gilbert Zulu, enjoyed the lion’s share of possession as the coal miners sought an equaliser.</p>
      <p>They were rewarded in the 71st minute when Ernest Gwatima converted from the penalty spot to salvage a point for Chipangano.</p>
      <p>That was after midfielder Admire Banda was hacked down by Moses Majika inside the box. Referee on the day, Thembinkosi Sibanda, pointed to the spot.</p>
      <p>From that moment on, the visitors took control of the game as they played with vigour.</p>
      <p>Chindungwe almost gave Hwange the lead by his curled effort from outside the box. However, the effort was well saved by Pride Zendera.</p>
      <p>The Gamecocks had chances, but they were not clinical in front of goal. They were a blunt chisel that cut everything else except the intended target.</p>
      <p>After the game, Antipas defended his charges.</p>
      <p>“Tight game. It’s only that we didn’t play our usual game. That was due to the fact that the boys are jaded.</p>
      <p>“The number of games we are having these days is hectic, it’s like living in pre-historic times. You know players are not horses, there is not much we can do about it, but all this is due to poor planning,” said Antipas.</p>
      <p>“We did well in some phases of the game. But we have not lost hope, we just have to keep believing.”</p>
      <p>Hwange goalkeepers coach Edmore Sibanda was pleased with the result.</p>
      <p>“We played very well. lt’s only that we made a blunder when we started our game, but as the game went on, we picked from there and managed to equalise in the second half.</p>
      <p>“It’s a fair result to us even though we drew. But we need to go back to the drawing board, and look at the upcoming match.</p>
      <p>“Chicken Inn was sitting back and at half-time we told the boys to go at them and put pressure on their mistakes. We now only need two wins in order to survive relegation,” he said.</p>
