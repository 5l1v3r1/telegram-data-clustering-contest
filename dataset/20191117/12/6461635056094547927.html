      <h1>Chelsea set to rival Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain star</h1>

      <h3>Barcelona face losing one of their most important targets for 2020 to a rejuvenating Premier League side interested in him as well.</h3>
      <p>Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain reached an agreement over a transfer for Neymar worth 222 million euros in 2017, a transfer fee that is a world record to this day. The Catalans cashed in on a huge profit by selling the Brazil international but foolishly spent that money on Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele both of who have flopped at the Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>Philippe Coutinho never settled into the Barca system and was unable to live up to the 145 million euros spent on him, and is already on his way out of Catalonia thanks to a loan move to Bayern Munich. On the other hand, Dembele’s issues have been extended away from the playing ground as well and he also faces being transfer listed some time soon.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde’s side is once again pursuing a transfer for Neymar, this time for Paris Saint-Germain and has been relentless in its attempt of doing so. The Parisians confirmed through different sources that their star man did want to leave for his former club during the summer, but there never came a reasonable offer worth considering.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/transfer-news/1199262/reports-chelsea-rival-barcelona-psg-neymar-signature-offering-highly-rated-star-callum-hudson-odoi-swap-deal/"><b>Fox Sports has claimed</b></a> that the Blaugrana will be facing competition from Premier League giants Chelsea in the upcoming year for Neymar. The Blues have looked like a side to fear since Frank Lampard’s appointment and with some young talent in its roster, Neymar could add experience thereby helping a balance to compete for the major titles.</p>
      <p>Chelsea are aware of the 200 million euros’ price tag that Paris Saint-Germain have set on Neymar, but are still optimistic of completing the signing by taking advantage of PSG and Barca’s poor relationships. As bait, the west Londoners will offer young prospect Callum Hudson-Odoi to the Ligue 1 champions so as to soften the loss of Neymar.</p>
      <p>Do you think Neymar will be attracted to Chelsea’s long-term project?</p>
