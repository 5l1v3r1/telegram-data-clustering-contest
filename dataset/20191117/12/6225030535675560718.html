      <p>With just 11 days remaining in the 2019 Fall Meet at Churchill Downs, 25-year-old jockey <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/person/T_Gaffalione">Tyler Gaffalione</a></b> trails perennial leading rider Corey Lanerie by four wins (19-15) in an attempt to defend his 2018 crown.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes as jockeys we get into a zone where we just keep winning races,” said Gaffalione, who recorded five wins over the last three days at Churchill Downs. “Obviously you have to have the horse underneath you but anytime you can win races in bunches it’s a good feeling.”</p>
      <p>Gaffalione began his climb up the standings with a four-win day on Nov. 9. The Florida-native, who will miss closing day of the Fall Meet to ride Got Stormy in the $300,000 Matriarch (G1) at Del Mar, entered Sunday’s 10-race program with a 22-percent win-clip for the meet with purse earnings topping $1.1 million.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a blessing to be able to ride in some of the biggest races this year and we hope to cap the year off with success,” Gaffalione said.</p>
      <p>While Lanerie and Gaffalione held the top two spots in the jockey standings, Ricardo Santana Jr. was in third with 12 wins and James Graham and Brian Hernandez Jr. were tied for fourth with 11 victories.</p>
