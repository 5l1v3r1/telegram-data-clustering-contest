      <h1>'We’ll see' - Sammy Ameobi talks about his Nottingham Forest future</h1>
      <h2>The summer arrival from Bolton has proved an astute signing by Forest, and a hit on the terraces</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Sammy Ameobi has set his sights on a new contract at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>, having impressed since arriving in the summer.</p>
      <p>The winger has proved a popular figure this season under Sabri Lamouchi, clocking up 17 appearances and popping up with a couple of vital goals.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/reason-sammy-ameobi-joined-nottingham-3013738">After leaving Bolton Wanderers</a> in June, Ameobi penned a one-year deal at the City Ground, though he hopes his performances thus far are doing him no harm and hopes to secure a longer-term deal on Trentside.</p>

      <p>“Yes, absolutely,” said <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/tactical-look-new-nottingham-forest-3019207">the 27-year-old</a> when asked if he’d like to stay at the club.</p>
      <p>“I’ve loved my time here so far, hopefully I’m working my way to a new contract," he told the club website.</p>
      <p>“We’ll see."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sammy-ameobi">Ameobi</a>’s first goal in the Garibaldi red came at Stoke City, a towering header to put his side 2-1 up after being a goal down, and he revealed just how that goal made him feel.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/sammy-ameobis-incredible-moment-nottingham-3371589">Relieved</a>.</p>
      <p>“To go 1-0 down is never good, to come back and get the goal we were relieved and we wanted to keep the result going.”</p>

      <p>Having been rested for Forest’s 3-0 win over Derby County in August, Ameobi was pivotal in ensuring the Reds were 1-0 winners in the Championship last weekend, an experience he quite enjoyed, coming on the back of bagging the winner at Luton.</p>
      <p>“It was wonderful,” beamed the former Newcastle United youngster.</p>
      <p>“A wonderful experience.</p>
      <p>“It’s the first one I’ve played in here so, it was great and an unbelievable atmosphere.</p>
      <p>“I loved it.”</p>
