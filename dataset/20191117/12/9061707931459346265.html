      <p>New plans to build a Marks and Spencer Foodhall on a historic Derby site have been revealed.</p>
      <p>A planning application has been submitted to Derby City Council to build a store on land off Wyvern Way, formerly occupied by the Derby Fireplace Company.</p>
      <p>Last November, an <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/derby-news/plans-new-ms-nandos-starbucks-2250003">application was rejected</a> to demolish the Derby Fireplace Company building to make way for three retail outlets - a M&amp;S Foodhall, a Nando’s restaurant and a Starbucks.</p>
      <p>Councillors refused the plans after officers found <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/derby-news/plans-new-ms-nandos-starbucks-2250003">“no solution” to any potential traffic problems.</a></p>
      <p>But, under the new plans, the building would be demolished to enable the construction of a M&amp;S Foodhall only.</p>
      <p>The plans suggest the 1.4-acre site would be accessed by customers via Wyvernside and would share its access with Pizza Hut and KFC.</p>

      <p>For some time now the developers have been hoping to build on the site. Back in 2014, another application was submitted to build three larger units on the land.</p>
      <p>But at the start of 2015 the application was withdrawn because they “prejudiced” the city council’s plans to make road improvements between the Wyvern and the A52.</p>
      <p>In planning documents submitted by RPS Group, on behalf of London Metric and Clowes Development, it said: "London Metric and Clowes Development have been in discussion with Derby City Council since November 2013 to explore the potential of retail development on this site.</p>
      <p>"In early 2018 a planning application was submitted on the basis of proposing three units (including a drive-thru’ coffee shop) within a single built form but was ultimately refused in November 2018 on grounds of transport and highway congestion impacts on the surrounding road network, particularly at peak times.</p>
      <p>"In late 2018 /early 2019 London Metric commenced reviewing the scheme composition and in part to alleviate traffic impact concerns, a design review instigated a fresh evolution of proposals (while in continuous liaison with Derby Highways) resulting in detailed proposals for a single occupier small food store on the site with ancillary car park and additional exit lane to alleviate peak congestion impacts."</p>

      <p>The application was submitted to the council on Thursday, November 7, and is currently pending consideration.</p>
      <p>Although the <a href="https://docs.derby.gov.uk/padocumentserver/DownloadDocument.aspx?docid=142056752">design and access statement</a> does not specify what food store would be built under the plans, the proposed <a href="https://docs.derby.gov.uk/padocumentserver/DownloadDocument.aspx?docid=142056828">site totem details</a> includes M&amp;S Food branding.</p>
