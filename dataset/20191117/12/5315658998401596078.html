      <p><b>"Pair rescued after being caught out by weather conditions"</b><br/>Please attribute to Sergeant Mark Kirkwood, O/C West Coast Search and Rescue:</p>
      <p>A search team has this morning located a father and son who were reported overdue from a tramp to the Cedar Flat Hut on the West Coast last night.</p>
      <p>The pair were expected to return from their tramp at 6pm and a search team was deployed after they failed to return.</p>
      <p>The search team walked through the night, reaching Cedar Flat Hut at 3am, where they located the missing pair.</p>
      <p>The father and son, along with the search team, were airlifted out by helicopter this morning.</p>
      <p>The weather in the area yesterday was extremely bad, with heavy rain making the track difficult to navigate at times, and flooding of rivers and creeks.</p>
      <p>Police are urging anyone heading out in the great outdoors, even if it's just for a day tramp, to check the weather forecast before leaving home.</p>
      <p>If the forecast is bad, please delay your trip until the conditions have improved.</p>
      <p>It is also vital that anyone heading out is equipped appropriately and wearing suitable clothing for the conditions.</p>
      <p>Police also recommend carrying a personal locator beacon.</p>
      <p>More information about staying safe in the outdoors can be found at <a href="http://www.mountainsafety.org.nz/">mountainsafety.org.nz</a> or <a href="http://www.adventuresmart.org.nz/">adventuresmart.org.nz</a>.</p>
