      <p>Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson has spoken to Jamie Carragher's 'Greatest Game' podcast about his earliest memories as a Sunderland fan.</p>
      <p>Before Henderson was leading Liverpool to Champions League glory and captaining his country, the 29-year-old started his career at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland.</a></p>
      <p>Like most young boys growing up on Wearside, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jordan-henderson">Henderson's</a> dreams were formed while watching the Black Cats play at both Roker Park and the Stadium of Light.</p>
      <p>The team Henderson grew up with was Peter Reid's side who twice finished seventh in the Premier League and beat Newcastle twice in successive years at St James' Park.</p>
      <p>And in conversation with his former Liverpool team-mate, Henderson spoke about his first memories of Sunderland, as well as the players that shaped his love of the game.</p>
      <p>Here is <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hdWRpb2Jvb20uY29tL2NoYW5uZWxzLzUwMDUwMzYucnNz&amp;episode=dGFnOmF1ZGlvYm9vbS5jb20sMjAxOS0xMS0xMzovcG9zdHMvNzQyMzEyOQ&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;ved=2ahUKEwil5dn9_u7lAhWVlFwKHfaqAkQQieUEegQIARAE&amp;ep=6&amp;at=1573916271862">everything he said.</a></p>
      <h3>First memories of Sunderland</h3>
      <p>"Briefly, I remember going to Roker Park when I was really young with my dad and I can just briefly remember the stadium inside and the pitch and things like that.</p>
      <p>"I was really small so I couldn't tell you [the game] but I remember the old-school ground.</p>
      <p>"My proper memories would be at the Stadium of Light with <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/kevin-phillips">Kevin Phillips,</a> Julio Arca, Micky Gray, those sorts of players.</p>
      <p>"The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/peter-reid">Peter Reid</a> team was the team I grew up with."</p>
      <h3>The Peter Reid era</h3>
      <p>"Those two seasons finishing seventh were big achievements for Sunderland and it was just about trying to maintain that.</p>
      <p>"They are really passionate about football the fans there and I know they would have wanted to get into Europe - that is just normal."</p>

      <h3>Favourite Sunderland player</h3>
      <p>"Phillips was a big one but I would say Arca was a big one for me, I loved him. The crowd loved him.</p>
      <p>"They used to sing 'Julio, Julio', they loved him. He had a great relationship on the left with Micky Gray and he stood out."</p>

      <h3>Play-off final defeat in 1998</h3>
      <p>"I watched it on the telly. I think I watched it in my dad's local golf club actually. When he missed the pen in the gold strip, not a great day."</p>
