      <h1>Using Story of Jewish Converts to Christianity, Pope Denounces Increasing Violence Against Jews</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:32:23+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/di/" target="_blank">David Israel</a></address>
      <p>Pope Francis last week warned that violence against Jews is on the rise again. Speaking at his weekly general audience, the pope reflected on the life of a first-century married Jewish couple who accompanied Paul in his ministry and were expelled from Rome by Claudius Caesar in the year 49, Crux reported.</p>
      <p>The pope departed for a moment from his prepared remarks to suggest the world has “seen so many brutalities done against the Jewish people, and we were convinced that this was over.”</p>
      <p>“But today the habit of persecuting Jews is beginning to be reborn,” he said. “Brothers and sisters: this is neither human nor Christian; the Jews are our brothers and sisters and must not be persecuted! Understood?”</p>
      <p>Following their expulsion from Rome, the Jewish couple settled in Corinth where they met Paul and welcomed him into their home. They later accompanied him on his travels to Syria.</p>
      <p>Pope Francis said that among all of Paul’s helpers, Priscilla and Aquila “emerge as models of a married life responsibly committed to the service of the entire Christian community.” He said the couple serve as a reminder that “thanks to the faith and commitment to evangelization by so many lay people like them, Christianity has come to us.”</p>
      <p>That story certainly doesn’t warm the hearts of too many Jewish people, seeing as Paul is viewed as the man responsible for turning the minor Christian cult into a world dominating juggernaut, complete with repression, torture and massacres of millions of Jews.</p>
      <p>We did some Wiki (check out Priscilla and Aquila), so you won’t have to, and came up with this: Priscilla and Aquila are described in the New Testament as providing a presence that strengthened the early Christian churches. Paul was generous in his recognition and acknowledgment of his indebtedness to them. Together, they are credited with instructing Apollos, a major evangelist of the first century, and “explaining to him the way of God more accurately.”</p>
      <p>Priscilla was a woman of Jewish heritage and one of the earliest known Christian converts who lived in Rome. Some scholars have suggested that Priscilla was the author of the Book of Hebrews.</p>
