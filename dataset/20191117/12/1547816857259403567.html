      <p>Calling it ‘unexpected pregnancy,’ the Yeh Jawaani Hai Dewaani actress said, “This was an unexpected pregnancy. In the first two months, I didn’t feel any maternal instinct. It felt like an alien invasion, where this little thing was acting like a vampire, sucking out everything from my body. When I heard the heartbeat for the first time, I got excited. The first trimester was bad, but I am through that phase and looking forward to the due date in January.”</p>

      <p>On being asked about her marriage with boyfriend Guy Hershberg, Kalki Koechlin asserted that the two have thought about marriage but they don’t want to rush into it, just because she is pregnant. “If it is necessary for the documentation, bureaucracy and school registrations of our child, we will consider it. But when it comes to our romantic commitments, we have enough validation from each other, and our families, too,” she added.</p>
