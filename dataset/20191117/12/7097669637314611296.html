      <h1>Russia Says Turkey May Buy More of Its S-400 Systems: Interfax</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:47:27+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/" target="_blank">Ilya Khrennikov</a></address>
      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Turkey is weighing whether to buy more of the S-400 missiles that have caused a feud with the Trump administration, according to the head of the Russian Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation.</p>
      <p>Moscow is also ready to ship its Su-35 fighter jets to Turkey, the Russian official, Dmitry Shugaev, told the Russian Interfax news agency in Dubai. Turkish officials weren’t immediately available for comment outside regular working hours.</p>
      <p>The U.S. has been considering sanctions against Turkey after Erdogan took delivery of a first Russian S-400 system earlier this year. It so far has suspended Ankara’s participation in its F-35 stealth fighter program, both as a developer and a purchaser.</p>
      <p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ruled out scrapping an already purchased S-400 system at a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump last week. He cited Turkey’s reliance on Russian gas supplies and income from its tourists as reasons.</p>
      <p>The S-400 was designed to shoot down U.S. and allied aircraft at greater ranges and altitudes than older systems. American officials are concerned that sensitive technology in the F-35 fighter plane designed to evade such a system could be compromised and used to improve the S-400 system if NATO-member Turkey has both.</p>
