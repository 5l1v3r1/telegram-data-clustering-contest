        <b>SIR Rod Stewart has revealed playing football saved him from the rocker lifestyle of drink and drugs.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a>-daft singer, 74, said he wasn't committed enough to become a professional footballer, despite having trials with London outfit Brentford FC in his teens.</p>

      <p>But he insisted he remained so dedicated to his regular kickabouts that he was always clean before games.</p>
      <p>He said: "Football sort of saved me a little bit."</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/radioscotland">BBC Radio Scotland's</a> Billy Sloan, the Maggie May star admitted that he downed copious amounts of alcohol as a young rocker.</p>
      <p>But he turned his back on drugs -- and said the most important reason was his twice-weekly football matches.</p>
      <p>He said: "Up until seven years ago I was still playing football Sunday mornings and Wednesday nights.</p>
      <p>"Especially Sunday mornings, I couldn't do drugs and drink too much, because it would have ruined my game.</p>

      <p>"So football sort of saved me a little bit.</p>
      <p>"I got arrested in Los Angeles on a Saturday night because they thought I was drink driving. I got taken to the police station and there was nothing in my system.</p>
      <p>"Any other night they would have done me but as it was a Saturday night I was going home early, getting rested up for a game at 11am the next morning.</p>
      <p>"But football has helped me so much and I miss it so much, not playing."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4933095/celtic-rod-stewart-green-brigade-mussolini-flares-lazio/">Celtic supporter</a> told how his Scottish father, a former amateur player, had wanted him to become a professional footballer.</p>
      <p>He famously attended trials with Third Division outfit Brentford -- now in the English Championship -- but admitted he already had a "burning desire" to be a singer.</p>
      <p>He said: "I wasn't good enough to be a footballer, although I tried -- I had trials at Brentford but just to keep my dad happy really.</p>
      <p>"Music had entered my soul and I couldn't commit to football, and the hours -- as a musician you can stay in bed all day."</p>

      <p>Asked if he could wave a magic wand and go back and become a world class footballer -- and play for his beloved Celtic or Scotland -- the music legend admitted he would not change a thing.</p>
      <p>He said: "No, not in a million years because I'm 74 -- do you know any footballers that are still playing at 74? The longevity of my career could not have gone on if I was a footballer.</p>
      <p>"It's a wonderful notion. I love the Hoops and I love Scotland, but I'm glad. I am dedicated to music. I don't think I ever was when I had my chance to be a footballer and I went for my trial at Brentford. I was never dedicated to it."</p>
      <p>Sir Rod, who has enjoyed stunning success over 50 years, will perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow this month the P&amp;J Arena in Aberdeen in December. But he insisted he has no plans to retire.</p>
      <p>He said: "Not at all because that's when you start thinking 'oh I've got nothing to do'. It's our jobs that drive us on and we should work as long as we can.</p>
      <p>"I don't want retirement. I refuse to use the word.</p>
      <p>"There will come a time, pretty soon, when I won't be doing all the rock'n'roll stuff, because I want to do the American songbook with a big orchestra, so at the moment I have no plans to retire, or even take it easy."</p>
