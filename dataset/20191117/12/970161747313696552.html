      <p>Season three of The Crown has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/what-time-is-the-crown-season-3-released-on-netflix-11167284/">only just landed on </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> but fans are already anticipating how future series will cover Prince Andrew’s friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Last night the Duke of York was grilled by Emily Maitlis during an intense BBC Newsnight interview <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-interview-described-nuclear-explosion-level-bad-11169720/">described as ‘nuclear explosion level bad’</a>, which saw him explain that he couldn’t have had sex with the woman accusing him as he’d <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-was-at-pizza-express-day-accuser-claims-she-was-forced-into-sex-with-him-11168884/">taken daughter Beatrice to Pizza Express on that specific date</a>.</p>
      <p>The Duke also admitted he did not regret his relationship with disgraced financier Epstein as it gave him the opportunity to meet people and help prepare for his role as a trade envoy.</p>
      <p>He said it was wrong to have stayed with Epstein and that he ‘let the side down’ but claimed he had no idea ‘what was going on’.</p>

      <p>Epstein, 66,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/billionaire-pedophile-jeffrey-epstein-died-murder-not-suicide-medical-examiner-says-11012530/"> a convicted sex offender was found dead in a New York jail cell in August</a>, while awaiting federal trial for sex trafficking.</p>
      <p>Virginia Roberts – now named Virginia Giuffre – is one of 16 women who says she was abused by Epstein and claimed she was forced to have sex with the Duke three times between 2001 and 2002.</p>

      <p>Mrs Giuffre said she was trafficked when she was 17 and was forced into sexual encounters with the Duke in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein.</p>
      <p>But the Duke claimed he could not have had sex with her because he had taken his daughter to Pizza Express in Woking on the alleged date.</p>
      <p>‘On that particular day, that we now understand is the date which is the 10th of March, I was at home,’ he said. ‘I was with the children and I’d taken Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking for a party at I suppose, sort of, four or five in the afternoon.</p>

      <p>‘And then because the duchess [of York] was away, we have a simple rule in the family that when one is away, the other one is there.’</p>

      <p>The Duke was first introduced in The Crown in season two episode Matrimonium and now long-standing fans of the show are excited to see how the drama will tackle the Duke’s relationship with Epstein.</p>
      <p>Sharing their thoughts on Twitter, one wrote: ‘The later seasons of the #TheCrown with #PrinceAndrew are going to be interesting….’</p>
      <p>Echoing a similar sentiment, another commented: ‘I can’t wait to see who will play Emily Maitlis and #PrinceAndrew when this comes around on a future season of #TheCrown.’</p>

      <p>This third instalment of the hit series The Crown sees Oscar winner Olivia Colman taking over from Golden Globe winner Claire Foy to play Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
      <p>It offers a fictionalised account of real-life events centring around the Royal Family between 1964 and 1977 – including Harold Wilson’s time as Prime Minister, the moon landing, the decolonisation of Africa and the Caribbean and Princess Margaret’s affair with Roddy Llewellyn.</p>

      <p>The Crown has already been confirmed for a fourth inning, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/07/gillian-anderson-confirmed-play-margaret-thatcher-crown-series-4-10702740/">Gillian Anderson being cast as Margaret Thatcher</a>.</p>
      <p>Netflix content boss Ted Sarandos revealed back in 2016 that the Netflix phenomenon is aiming to air six seasons spanning 60 years.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/crown-will-run-six-seasons-netflix-boss-ted-sarandos-948671">The Hollywood Reporter</a> at the time, he said: ‘The idea is to do this over six decades, in six seasons presumably, and make the whole show over eight to 10 years.’</p>
      <p>Given the first episode of The Crown was set in 1947, the last series should, therefore, run up until 2007, years after the Duke and Epstein are said to have met.</p>
