      <p>Election results announced so far by the Independent National Electoral Commission in the Kogi West senatorial rerun election show that PDP’s Dino Melaye is poised to lose his seat in the Senate to his closest rival, Smart Adeyemi of the APC.</p>
      <p>Of the seven local government areas in the senatorial district, five have been announced.</p>
      <p>Of the five local government results announced, Mr Adeyemi has polled a total of 52,389 while Mr Melaye trails with 37,856.</p>
      <p>The former won in all of Kaba Bunnu, Kogi Koton Karfe, Mopa Muro and Ijumu. Mr Melaye, however, scooped the highest votes in one LGA, Yagba East LGA.</p>
      <p>Messrs Adeyemo and Delays are both from Ijumu</p>
      <p>With the sail in Mr Adeyemi’s favour, Mr Melaye needs to cover up for the deficit of 14,533 votes in the two remaining local government areas that are yet to be announced by INEC.</p>
      <p>These local government areas are Yabgba West and Lokoja LGAs.</p>
      <p>The elections in Kogi West, like in a large part of the state, was characterized by violence.</p>
      <p>Below is the breakdown of how both candidates fared in the five local governments announced so far.</p>
