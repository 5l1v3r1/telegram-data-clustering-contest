      <p>Prithvi Shaw announced his return to the cricketing circuit by smashing a spectacular half-century in the ongoing Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2019-20 match between Mumbai and Assam on Sunday. The 20-year-old opener scored 63 off just 39 deliveries, which included seven boundaries and two sixes. His innings was well complemented by his opening partner Aditya Tare as Mumbai piled up a huge 206/5 in 20 overs.</p>
      <p>Shaw and Tare got Mumbai off to a brilliant start as the duo added 138 for the opening wicket before the latter was removed by Riyan Parag on 82 off 48 balls. Shaw initially started off with a cautious approach but the right-handed batsman soon accelerated his innings as he completed his half-century in 32 deliveries.</p>
      <p>After completing his half-century, Shaw raised his bat in elegance and gestured towards the camera, indicating ‘let my bat to do the talking.’</p>

      <p>He was later removed by Parag in the 16th over when he tried to smash him over the midwicket fence but failed in the process.</p>
      <p>Days before he was included in the Mumbai squad for the domestic T20 tournament, Shaw had promised his well-wishers for a strong comeback. The opener batsman was banned from all forms of cricket by the BCCI for a (retrospective) period of eight months in July after failing a dope test during the Mushtaq Ali Trophy in March.</p>
      <p>On the occasion of his 20th birthday, Shaw took to social media to share a video of himself practicing in the nets. “I turn 20 today. I assure it will be Prithvi Shaw 2.0 going forward. Thank u for all the good wishes &amp; support. Will be back in action soon.” he had tweeted.</p>
      <p>Apart from playing for Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League, Shaw has represented India in two Test matches. In the home series played against West Indies last year, the 20-year-old completed a ton on his India Test debut and amassed 237 runs in three innings.</p>
