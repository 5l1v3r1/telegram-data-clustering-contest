      <p>In an exclusive interview with Soccer Laduma, Wayne Sandilands looked back to open up about how he felt about Milutin ‘Micho’ Sredojevic’s departure.</p>
      <p>Orlando Pirates are yet to find their feet after Coach Micho’s departure earlier this season, although there is much confidence in interim Head Coach, Rulani Mokwena to turn things around.</p>

      <p>Speaking in an exclusive interview with Soccer Laduma, Sandilands revealed how the team has handled the situation since Sredojevic left the club.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think any of us saw that coming, to be honest. But coach Rhulani had done so much and he was such an important part of that coaching duo with coach Micho,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Obviously coach Micho is a character you can’t really replace, but that’s not what coach Rhulani is trying to do anyway because he is his own man. But I honestly feel we don’t think about that much anymore and I don’t think he derailed the train in any way.”</p>
      <p>“Obviously, it was unexpected and it might have caused a little bit more noise and a little bit more emotions and focus detracted a bit on the field, but we can’t use that as an excuse for not doing as well as he had hoped. We’ve looked at ourselves as a collective and as individuals and just know that besides tactical things, there were other footballing aspects that we needed to improve on.”</p>
      <p>“And some aspects may not have even been football- related, that we as individuals and as a group needed to improve on. We’ve had a hard look at ourselves to see where it’s all gone wrong and where we can improve,” he added.</p>
