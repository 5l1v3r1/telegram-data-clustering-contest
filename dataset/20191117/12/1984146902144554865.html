      <p>The drummer of North East band <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/lindisfarne">Lindisfarne</a> had a cheeky response to Liam Gallagher's tweet ahead of his <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle</a> gig.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/oasis">Oasis</a> frontman will take to the stage at the Utilita Arena on Sunday evening and told fans he was looking forward to it.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: "The fog on the Tyne is all mine all mine câ€™mon you know LG x" - quoting Lindisfarne's most famous tune.</p>
      <p>The band's founding member and drummer Ray Laidlaw had fans laughing as he replied: "No it's not."</p>

      <p>One Twitter user said: "Get him telt Ray son".</p>
      <p>Ray, who played with the band on and off between 1968 and 2003, is also heavily involved in events such as Sunday for Sammy and Christmas at the Cathedral for the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation.</p>
      <p>Liam has yet to respond to Ray's Tweet.</p>
      <p>The star is touring his second solo album Why Me? Why Not which follows 2017's As You Were, which led to sell-out shows.</p>
      <p>Liam Gallagher and support acts will kick off his 2020 tour at Newcastle Utilita Area from 7pm on Sunday November 17.</p>
