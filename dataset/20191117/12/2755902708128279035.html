      <p>There are suspicions that a 26-year-old Gutu woman who slipped and drowned in a river met her tragic end after she tried to fight off a prophet who wanted to ra_pe her.</p>
      <p>Priviledge Mabasa was found firmly clutching the self-styled prophet Benson Mutuzungara’s shirt in her hands when her body was retrieved by the Police from Mutorahuku River.</p>
      <p>Masvingo Province Police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Kudakwashe Dhewa confirmed the tragedy to <a href="http://www.masvingomirror.com/2019/11/woman-drowns-as-prophet-tries-to-rape.html">Masvingo Mirror</a>.</p>
      <p>The late’s uncle and family spokesperson Team Shereni Mabasa said Madzibaba Benson failed to explain why he removed his shirt when he was baptizing the deceased.</p>
      <p>Madzibaba Benson claimed that a strong wind blew as he baptized the deceased and she slipped out of his hands, fell into the river and vanished .</p>
      <aside>“We suspect that Madzibaba Benson did something to Privilege because she died whilst holding his T-shirt in her hands and Madzibaba cannot explain why he removed the T-shirt.<br/>“We buried her with the T-shirt because we failed to pull it out of her clutching hands,” said a family member.</aside>
      <p>A family spokesperson said elders agreed to bury Mabasa with the shirt clutched in her hands after they failed to remove it.</p>
