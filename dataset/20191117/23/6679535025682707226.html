      <h1>Temple tanks, the best bet for rainwater harvesting</h1>
      <h2>Experts opine that sprawling waterbodies in Madurai, associated with major temples, can be better utilised to recharge groundwater</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:54:01+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Sanjana-Ganesh-8992/" target="_blank">Sanjana Ganesh</a></address>
      <p>Repeated reference of Madurai as a Temple City may sound clichéd. Dig deeper and there are layers and layers of ancient wisdom and practices associated with the city’s temples and their tanks. And they were evolved for the good of the whole community.</p>
      <p>Some of these man-made temple tanks do boast of architectural heritage. But in this age of urban decay and loss of natural resources, environmental experts view these sprawling temple tanks as the best places for rainwater harvesting.</p>
      <p>The temple tanks come to life during float festivals. With history as old as the temples they are associated with, what is the status of major temple tanks such as Mariamman Teppakulam, Prasanna Venkatachalapathy Temple tank and Koodal Azhagar Perumal Temple tank?</p>
      <h3>The necessity</h3>
      <p>S. Elamuhil, Project Executive with DHAN Foundation’s CURE, says tanks were initially dug to quench the thirst of the numerous labourers involved in temple construction. They ended up providing water and soil needed for construction of the temple. On most occasions, after construction was over, they became sprawling temple tanks with granite walls and ghats with a flight of steps all around it.</p>
      <p>“The temple tanks are usually connected to irrigation tanks, rivers and channels. In some places the run-off from hillocks got collected in them. The natural springs in the vicinity of the temples are revered as ‘theerthams.’ In some places, the springs themselves doubled up as temple tanks,” he says.</p>
      <p>Temple tanks have mandapams at the centre from which rulers had a grandstand view of the float festival. Temple tanks are not concrete lined so as to as allow water to seep into the ground and recharge the aquifers, he says.</p>
      <h3>Current status</h3>
      <p>These temple tanks were simple and ingenious marvels as they collected and conserved water, even at a time when it was not scarce. But what is the present status of these functional models? B. Thirumalai, a temple expert, says most inlet channels to the temple tanks are either blocked or filled with sewage.</p>
      <p>Mr. Elamuhil says sewage from households and commercial establishments such as hotels and restaurants have increased the organic load of temple tanks. Koodal Azhagar Perumal Temple Tank, off Town Hall Road, in the very heart of the city is 240 feet wide and 260 feet long. Now it is used as a public toilet. Alcohol bottles and cigarette butts are strewn all over the place.</p>
      <p>Ashraf Yusuf, secretary of Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants’ Association, says 10 years ago the tank was half-full and charged the groundwater in the area. “Now we buy water from tankers at a high cost. If water could be diverted into this tank through a proper source and maintained well, it will continue to serve the people,” he says.</p>
      <p>Ever since the Corporation tried to redirect water through some source a decade ago, drainage started mixing with the water and emanated a stench for miles. If the underground drainage system in the area is properly reviewed, things can be set right, he says.</p>
      <p>A similar situation of drainage entering Mariamman Teppakulam was reported in February this year. Joint commissioner of Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple N. Natarajan had said that they tried bio-remediation, a natural process where microbes cleaned contaminated soil, groundwater and surface when water is first let into the tank.</p>
      <h3>Botched attempt</h3>
      <p>Corporation engineers say a recent project, inaugurated by Minister Sellur K. Raju on November 9, to divert Vaigai river water through Panaiyur channel using RCC pipes to ensure uninterrupted supply into the tank came a cropper. “It was laid to link the river and the channel. But the level of riverbed has become so low that water could not reach the pipe,” says an engineer.</p>
      <h3>A success model</h3>
      <p>The Prasanna Venkatachalapathy Temple Tank in Tallakulam can serve as an example to other tanks. With the Corporation taking efforts to redirect water from stormwater drains on Gokhale Road, the deity did float through the tank during float festival this year, unlike in the recent years when it was taken around on dry ground. City Engineer S. Arasu says this model would be replicated for other tanks too.</p>
