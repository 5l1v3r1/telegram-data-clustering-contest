      <p>This is how bad pass interference has gotten in the NFL.</p>
      <p>49ers QB Jimmy G was trying to get a quick pass to his fullback Kyle Juszcyzk, but Cardinals linebacker was in front of him and had better position to get the ball.</p>
      <p>Kyle Juszcyzk jumped and tackled Walked from behind, which drew a flag that was thrown for defensive pass interference….on the guy who was interfered with and got tackled from behind.</p>
