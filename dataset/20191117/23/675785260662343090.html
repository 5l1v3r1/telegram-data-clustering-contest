      <p>Discount retailer Home Bargains has long been loved by shoppers for its low prices and wide range of products.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool-based chain opened its first store in Old Swan in 1976.</p>
      <p>The retailer now stocks around 4,000 branded products, according to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/22-home-bargains-hacks-youll-17222242">Liverpool Echo</a> .</p>
      <p>Despite its regular deals, there are some tips to save even more money at Home Bargains.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Look at the price tag to see how long an item is in stock for</b>
      </p>
      <p>An insider from the store has revealed the price tags, as well as revealing the cost of an item, also show whether the product is a one-off or a regularly stocked product.</p>
      <p>The initials REG stand for regular, meaning the product will be in stock the majority of the time and restocked when they sell out.</p>
      <p>ONE, however, stands for one off.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Head to bigger stores if you are looking for a particular item</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bigger stores receive daily stock replenishment, while smaller stores get less frequent deliveries.</p>

      <p>
        <b>3. Don't be in a rush to get inside</b>
      </p>
      <p>Some of the best deals are located near the front of the store.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Star buys</b>
      </p>
      <p>Usually located near the front of the store, they change weekly and include discounts on branded products.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Get there early</b>
      </p>
      <p>New stock is often delivered at around 7.30am in the morning so it will help to visit the store when it opens.</p>
      <p>
        <b>6. Try its food range</b>
      </p>
      <p>There is a mix of fresh fruit and veg alongside cupboard essentials and more.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Home Bargains also stocks items which look like designer products - but for much less.</p>
      <p>
        <b>8. Take a break while shopping</b>
