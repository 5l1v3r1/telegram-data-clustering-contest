      <p>WAPIC Insurance Plc has, within the period ended September 30, 2019 grown profit to N2.45 billion, a 78 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth from the N1.38 billion recorded in the preceding period of last year, its Managing Director, Mrs. Yinka Adekoya, said.</p>
      <p>In a statement,  she said the result is from the Group’s Unaudited Financial Results for the period ended September 30, 2019.</p>
      <p>She said the growth was driven by the company’s sustained leadership status in some major accounts, attainment of increased market shares and enhanced underwriting capabilities.</p>
      <p>She disclosed that the firm recorded 26 per cent YoY increase in gross written premiums for the period.</p>
      <p>According to her, the growth in premiums and decrease in net claims expense during the period under review had a positive impact on this position.</p>
      <p>She said: “The cost optimisation measures put in place continued to pay off as operating expenses dropped by 8 per cent to N3.2 billion year on year, compared to the prior period’s position of N3.5 billion. There was a notable growth in profit before tax for the period at 129 per cent to close at N1.1 billion compared to the N475 million in the same period of 2018.</p>
      <p>“Wapic Life Assurance wrote N2.1 billion in gross written premium within the nine months period, a 36 per cent YoY growth in premium performance compared to the 2018 position of N1.52 billion. Net claims expenses declined by 22 per cent to N778 million within the nine-month period compared to the corresponding year’s position of N995 million.</p>
