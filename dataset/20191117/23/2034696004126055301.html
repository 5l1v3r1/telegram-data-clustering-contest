      <p>Last month, the band announced a comeback show at Los Angeles’ Shrine Expo Hall taking place on December 20. Tickets went on sale on November 1 and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/fans-react-chemical-romance-reunion-show-sells-minutes-2563843">sold out in minutes.</a></p>
      <p>Gerard Way and co. then <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/my-chemical-romance-confirm-two-more-shows-as-part-of-comeback-2564849">shared details of three shows scheduled for 2020.</a> Posting on their social media channels, the band announced they will be playing in Australia, New Zealand and Japan early next year.</p>
      <p>My Chemical Romance will play at The Outer Fields at Western Springs Stadium in Auckland on March 25, along with special guests <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/jimmy-eat-world">Jimmy Eat World</a>, Midnight Youth, and Miss June.</p>
      <p>Today (November 17), the band shared the first picture of themselves since reforming. Simply captioned, “11.15.19” – which is presumably the date it was taken – the black and white picture shows the band sat on the floor in a rehearsal space.</p>
