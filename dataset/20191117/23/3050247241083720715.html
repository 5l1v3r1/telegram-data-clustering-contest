      <h3>Slow bleed to $8,200 possible?</h3>
      <p>On Friday, Bitcoin attempted to break the $9,000 price level, but was swiftly rejected and brought back to lower levels below $8,600, where it remained throughout the entire weekend.</p>
      <p>Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe remains positive about the return of overall bullish sentiment, but would like to “see a tick up to like $8,800 to confirm a slight trend reversal (like scenario),” <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-back-on-the-edge-says-trader-after-88k-rejection">adding</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“If not, this slow bleed could accelerate to $8,200 as the next level. Sentiment; fear. Obviously.”</blockquote>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), meanwhile, is currently sitting close to $183 per coin. The number one altcoin continues to trade in perfect sync with BTC, showing upward price behavior leading to its current trading position, up .73% on the day.</p>
