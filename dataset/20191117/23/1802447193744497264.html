      <p>George who?</p>
      <p>The 49ers are without <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/12276/george-kittle">George Kittle</a>, who had six catches for 79 yards and a touchdown against the Cardinals two weeks ago. But Arizona can’t stop his replacement, <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13522/ross-dwelley">Ross Dwelley</a>.</p>
      <p>Dwelley, who had no touchdowns in his first 20 games, has scored two today. He had another called back for a holding penalty on center <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/9534/weston-richburg">Weston Richburg</a>. The 49ers settled for a field goal on that drive to close the first half.</p>
      <p>They opened the second half with a six-play, 84-yard drive, with Dwelley’s 5-yard touchdown giving the 49ers their first lead of the day.</p>
      <p>San Francisco leads 17-16 with 11:07 remaining in the third quarter.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/9360/jimmy-garoppolo">Jimmy Garoppolo</a> now is 12-of-19 for 196 yards and the two touchdowns to Dwelley. Dwelley’s first touchdown was 4 yards.</p>
      <p>Dwelley’s three catches have gone for only 11 yards.</p>
      <p>The 49ers trailed 16-0 and had only 2 yards on their first three possessions. The last time the 49ers rallied from a deficit of 16 points or more in the regular season was Oct. 2, 2011, when they were down 23-3 to the Eagles before winning 24-23, according to Josh Dubow of the Associated Press.</p>
      <p>The 49ers overcame a 17-0 deficit against the Falcons in the NFC Championship Game on Jan. 20, 2013.</p>
