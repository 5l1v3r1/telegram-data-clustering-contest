      <h3>Sofia Jamora Rocks A Red Bikini Top &amp; Eats Pizza</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/instagram/">Sofia Jamora</a> shared photos of herself rocking a bright red bikini top during a fun outing in Los Angeles. The first of the three pictures she posted to Instagram shows Sofia posing with a plate in her left hand and a slice of pizza in the other while she stands in front of a pizza place. The low-cut bikini top featured thin, halter-style straps. Sofia paired this with high-waisted, light denim shorts, which were rolled up at the bottom. The stunner wore her hair down in loose waves pulled in front of her left shoulder.</p>
      <p>The first photo shows Sofia smiling with her lips parted, as she tilted her head slightly back. For makeup, she used shimmery white eyeshadow, along with glossy lipstick. The second picture in the set shows the model wearing the same outfit as she takes a bite of pizza, continuing to smile and look at the camera. Behind her is a green-and-white striped awning, along with an unlit neon sign above it. The pizzeria had some outdoor seating.</p>
      <p>It was apparently a sunny day outside when the photo was taken, and Sofia continued her fun at another restaurant. In the third photo of the set, she is wearing a completely different outfit. The shirt, which featured an open back with strappy accents, had long, puffy sleeves and shoulders. Additionally, she wore light denim bottoms, posing with her back facing the camera. In this photo, she was inside an airy atrium, with a heat lamp on one side and green plants throughout. Sofia glanced over her right shoulder and gave a coy look when this snap was taken.</p>

      <p>Fans let Sofia know how great they thought she looked in the comments section.</p>
      <p>“You hurt my soul with how hot you are,” claimed a follower.</p>
      <p>“The baddest natural woman on ig imo,” declared an admirer.</p>
      <p>Others talked about the food.</p>

      <p>“Hi yes I’d like to order a pizza with a side of Sofia,” joked a fan.</p>
      <p>“You really need to get off my feed looking like THAT while i’m over here eating a burrito,” said a fourth Instagram user.</p>
      <p>The stunner shared another update earlier this month that showed her rocking another piece of swimwear. This time, she sizzled in a white ensemble, which left her toned body on display. Sofia was seen walking from the ocean to the shore, as she pouted and gave flirty looks. The clip was slowed down as she <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5733824/sofia-jamora-slow-motion/">flaunted her nearly bare derriere</a>. Palm trees and lounge chairs could be seen in the backdrop of the tropical paradise.</p>
