      <p>Didier Deschamps spoke of his pride after his France side marked his 100th match as manager with a 2-0 win in Albania.</p>
      <p>Antoine Griezmann scored one after setting up the opener for Corentin Tolisso as the world champions secured top spot in their Euro 2020 qualifying group.</p>
      <p>Olivier Giroud also hit the woodwork in the second half as France enjoyed a comfortable evening in Tirana to finish two points ahead of Turkey in Group H.</p>
      <p>World Cup-winning boss Deschamps said in comments reported by L’Equipe: “I’ve had a lot of testimonials from all of my staff, my president and my players, and it warms my heart.</p>
      <p>“I depend a lot on the players, those who were here today and those present from the beginning who allowed the team of France to gain these very good results.</p>
      <p>“It’s a personal pride but I’m especially proud to see what they do together with that spirit.”</p>
      <p>Deschamps feels his side have had to prove themselves again because their World Cup win has made them a target for opponents.</p>
      <p>He said: “We have eight wins, one draw and one loss. We are doing better than two years ago.</p>
      <p>“The bar was higher with what we had last summer.”</p>
      <p>France must now wait to see if they will be one of the six group winners to earn a top seeding at next summer’s tournament.</p>
      <p>Deschamps said: “We cannot do better than first. It may have needed more points but some big nations can also find themselves in hats three or four.</p>
      <p>“We did what we wanted to do. We have what we deserve.”</p>
