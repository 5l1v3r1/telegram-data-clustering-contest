        <b>Jason Derulo finally responded to the harsh criticism of the upcoming film <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/cats-movie/">Cats</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Swalla singer confessed he was surprised by the divisive reaction to the film when the trailer dropped in July.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Australian publication <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/jason-derulo-says-cats-movie-with-taylor-swift-judi-dench-rebel-wilson-and-idris-elba-is-as-creepy-and-weird-as-it-seems/news-story/8e071b8840420346825317fa3942c138">Confidential</a>, Jason explained: ‘I don’t think I have ever seen such a polarising reaction from any other trailer ever.’</p>
      <p>To be fair, it wasn’t the idea of the movie that spooked fans, it was the weirdly human-like felines that put people off.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old believes the visuals are an important part of the experience considering the original stage show’s characters look similar.</p>
      <p>‘I knew that was what it would be from the jump and that is what I hoped it would be because that is what I felt like was the magic of the stage play,’ Jason said.</p>
      <p>‘It is unlike anything that you’ve ever seen before so everything that has been said about it being creepy or left and weird, it is all of that and more.’</p>

      <p>Although the cast – which includes Taylor Swift, Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen and Idris Elba – is amazing, viewers were still creeped out by the mix of CGI and live-action which meant the female cats had feminine ‘curvy’ figures (because all cats have snatched waists, obviously).</p>

      <p>Jason is playing the role of the feline playboy, Rum Tum Tugger, and we were only mildly disturbed by how his character looked.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Jason didn’t help Cats’ case when he dropped on all fours on The Kelly Clarkson show.</p>
      <p>The singer raised eyebrows when he demonstrated to the host what he learned on the set of Cats.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘So you’ll be on two feet and you’ll just be having a conversation…’ before swiftly dropping on all fours much to viewers’ delight</p>

      <p>Jason really got into the demonstration as he made sure his back was straight while walking across the stage, staring into the crowd.</p>
      <p>We’re not too sure how we feel about any part of his demonstration but at least Jason looks like he’s having a blast.</p>
