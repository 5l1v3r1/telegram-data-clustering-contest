      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lily-allen/">Lily Allen</a>, Idina Menzel, Holly Willoughby, Stacey Soloman and Jonathan Groff were among the stars looking cool as cucumbers on the red carpet of the Frozen 2 European premiere tonight.</p>
      <p>Some stars even brought their adorable kids to London’s South Bank dressed up in Frozen-themed costumes and it’s too cute.</p>
      <p>Voice actors present at the premiere include Idina Menzel – who plays the ice queen herself, Elsa – as well as Jonathan Groff (who plays Kristoff) and Josh Gad (who plays snowman, Olaf).</p>
      <p>Also present were directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, as well as Walt <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/disney/">Disney</a> film producer Peter Del Vecho.</p>
      <p>Lily Allen’s girls Marnie Rose, 6, and Ethel, 7, stole the show with little Elsa and Anna costumes, while their mother stood tall in a long dress and boots.</p>
      <p>This Morning presenter Holly looked chic yet warm in a simple all black outfit with a houndstooth coat thrown casually around her shoulders.</p>

      <p>She definitely dressed for the chilly November evening adding long black leather gloves to her look.</p>
      <p>And her look was finished off with a festive-feel thanks to her pretty snowflake shaped hair accessory.</p>

      <p>It was a real family affair for Stacey Soloman, who brought along her two boys, Rex and Leighton, as well as her nieces, Darcy and Mila.</p>
      <p>(Isn’t little Rex in the reindeer outfit the cutest?)</p>
      <p>While YouTube star and current Strictly Come Dancing contestant Saffron Barker wore a matching dress with her little cousin, Ivy.</p>

      <p>Guy Ritchie was joined by his wife Jacqui Ainsley, as well as their three children – Rafael, 8, Rivka, 6, and Levi, 5.</p>
      <p>Although the plot details of Frozen 2 have been kept under lock and key, we’ve seen from the trailer that Elsa and Anna will venture beyond the kingdom of Arendelle.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>And, perhaps ominously, a character in the trailer says: ‘We have always feared that Elsa’s powers were too much for this world. Now, we must hope they are enough.’</p>
      <p>We can’t wait to see what happens.</p>
