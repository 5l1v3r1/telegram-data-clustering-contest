      <p>A 17-year-old P-plater driving a car with two other teenage passengers has smashed into a home in Grange overnight, prompting the SES to secure the property.</p>
      <p>Police say the teenage boy was driving a Holden Commodore on Westmoreland Rd in Grange just before 9.30pm on Sunday when he lost control while turning onto Ian St.</p>
      <p>He crashed into a house, as well as a car in the driveway of the property.</p>
      <p>Also in the Commodore were two 17-year-old passengers, which violates P-plate conditions.</p>
      <p>No one was injured in the crash.</p>
      <p>A brick pillar was extensively damaged, prompting the State Emergency Service to sure up the property.</p>
      <p>The driver was issued an on-the-spot fine for failing to maintain control of the car and breaching his P-plate conditions.</p>
      <p>Police say further charges are likely at a later time.</p>
