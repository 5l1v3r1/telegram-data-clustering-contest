      <p>The district forest department would install CCTV cameras at various places in its limits to improve surveillance and check poaching.</p>
      <p>There are nine ranges under the Salem forest limits and in the first phase, the forest department has planned to install CCTV cameras at five check posts, forest range offices in Mettur and Kalrayan, sandalwood depot and on the district forest office premises.</p>
      <p>Forest officials said that the project was being implemented at a cost of ₹8 lakh and it would assist in round the clock surveillance at those points.</p>
      <p>Forest department officials said that the CCTV cameras would be installed at forest check posts at Ayothiyapattinam, Pappanaikenpatti, Karavalli and Kolathur. District Forest Officer A.Periasamy said, “the surveillance cameras would help in the check of unauthorised entry into forest areas and it would also help us in identifying poaching. Certain poaching cases has been reported in some of the limits and there is also movement of vehicles from other districts. Use of CCTV cameras would help in identifying the miscreants.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Periasamy also said that the department would also set up percolation ponds at various points in its limits to prevent animals from venturing out of forests for water and to avoid road kills.</p>
