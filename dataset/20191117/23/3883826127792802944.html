        <figcaption>Prince Andrew's BBC Newsnight interview makes the front of many papers for another day. The Times reports that the duke is "defiant" over his decision to speak out about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, despite widespread criticism. The paper mentions unconfirmed reports that the duke was even said to have told the Queen that the interview went "pretty well". Palace insiders are bracing themselves for several days of negative publicity, it adds.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Monday's Sun also reports that Prince Andrew told his mother, the Queen, that his TV interview - which the Sun calls "disastrous" - was "a great success". The paper describes him as "buoyant" as he attended church with Her Majesty on Sunday. Virginia Giuffre - who claims she was forced to have sex with the duke aged 17, which the duke denies - called his denials "appalling", the paper says.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>However, the Daily Mail reports that Prince Andrew has told friends that he regretted one particular aspect of the interview - not expressing sympathy to Epstein's victims in the interview. The duke said he had "great sympathy" for anyone abused by Epstein, the paper says. "When I said I was shocked I thought that was implicit," he added to friends.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Guardian also leads with the royal interview, saying the duke "faced disbelief and fury on both sides of the Atlantic". It has spoken to two lawyers, representing 10 of Epstein's victims, who say the prince should now volunteer to be interviewed by the FBI. Meanwhile, the main picture on the front of the Guardian is a portrait of actress Brigitte Bardot, taken by photographer Terry O'Neill who has died aged 81.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Monday's i newspaper also focuses on the calls from the lawyers representing Epstein's victims, saying the prince must speak to American investigators.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>For the Metro newspaper, the response to Prince Andrew's interview has been a "backlash of unprecedented proportions". The paper says the Duke of York was met with "both mockery and condemnation" over the interview, and quotes broadcaster Piers Morgan who called some of the duke's comments "toe-curling".</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Daily Mirror has spoken to a former royal protection officer, who has called for a police probe into Prince Andrew following his TV interview, in which he denied having any recollection of Virgina Giuffre. "It beggars belief the stupidity of his answers," says Dai Davies.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The ongoing election campaign makes the top story for the Daily Express, and in particular Boris Johnson's pledge to cut business taxes if the Tories win. The PM is due to speak to business leaders later today, where he will also promise to reduce business rates. The paper says the tax cuts will "spur a surge in economic growth".</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Daily Star takes aim at university chiefs who it describes as "PC mad" after the Universities and Colleges Union said it allows its members to self-identify which race they are. The headline - "Flakes told: Choose your own race" - refers to snowflakes, the derogatory term given to younger generations who are viewed as less resilient.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Financial Times leads with the news that Saudi Arabia has placed a preliminary valuation on its state oil company Aramco, seeking more than $25bn (Â£19.3m) for the sale of 1.5% of its shares. The paper says it is just "a fraction of the $100bn it had once hoped for", after foreign investors gave its original ambitious plan a "lukewarm response".</figcaption>
