      <p>A 79-year-old man from Meeniyan died at the scene.</p>
      <p>A 74-year-old woman travelling in the same car, also from Meeniyan, was flown to the Royal Melbourne Hospital in a stable condition with chest injuries.</p>
      <p>An 18-year-old Leongatha man, who had to be freed after becoming trapped in the second car, has been airlifted to The Alfred hospital in a critical condition.</p>
      <p>Police are investigating the exact cause of the crash.</p>
      <p>The collision brings Victoria's road toll for the year so far to 241 â€“ 57 more than the same time last year.</p>
      <p>The South Gippsland Highway remained closed on Monday morning, just south of the hospital.</p>
      <p>Police were directing traffic and the Department of Transport advised motorists to use the Bass Highway and Koonwarra-Inverloch Road instead.</p>
