      <p>Chris Ramsey joked his Strictly Come Dancing performance at Blackpool Tower was better than all of his comedy gigs combined.</p>
      <p>He opened the start of the incredible Blackpool show last night and gushed that he had been honoured to perform there.</p>
      <p>Ahead of Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard's dance-off against Michelle Visage and Giovanni Pernice, host Claudia Winkleman sat down with the comedian to ask his thoughts.</p>
      <p>Praising him for kicking off the start of yesterday's show, Claudia told him: "You opened the show in Blackpool.</p>
      <p>"You just loved every second!"</p>
      <p>A very overwhelmed Chris laughed: "That was better than all of my previous Blackpool gigs ever combined.</p>

      <p>"That was the biggest attended... that was the best gig I've ever had in Blackpool."</p>
      <p>His professional dance partner Karen Hauer giggled beside him as the star got emotional with Blackpool being so close to home.</p>
      <p>Furious <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> fans raged that the show was "ruined" after Michelle Visage became the eighth contestant to leave the competition this evening.</p>

      <p>Raging viewers flocked to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> and lashed out at the show after the judges chose to send her and Giovanni Pernice home - despite the pair receiving consistently high scores in the previous weeks.</p>
      <p>One viewer raged: "um @michellevisage deserved to be in the final because of her incredible dancing talent, and she got kicked out half way just because she wanted to create something meaningful for a community that has supported her. and she executed it flawlessly. absolute MESS #strictlyspoiler."</p>

      <p>A distraught Michelle said: "At 51 years old and never danced in my life, I never thought I'd be able to do what I have done and to have such an incredible partner.</p>
      <p>"To be here for my husband and my kids and the entire community, that's why I did what I did. I am so honoured to be welcomed by my new friends here."</p>
