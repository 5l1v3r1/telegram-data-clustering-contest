      <p>FRANKFURT, Nov 18 — Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong urged Germany yesterday to stop military training assistance to China after its troops appeared in the protest-hit Asian financial hub, a German daily reported.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the top-selling <i>Bild</i> newspaper, Wong said: “It makes me furious that the German Bundeswehr is apparently helping to train Chinese soldiers. Given the riots in Hong Kong, the defence ministry should have ended this programme long ago.”</p>
      <p>The sudden emergence of soldiers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the streets of Hong Kong Saturday rattled nerves in the semi-autonomous territory, rocked by months of increasingly violent anti-government protests.</p>
      <p>In a rare and highly symbolic troop movement, the plainclothes soldiers briefly left their Kowloon barracks to help clean up debris and bricks from the protests.</p>
      <p>Wong also told <i>Bild</i> that Hong Kong security forces were using “German water cannon” against protesters.</p>
      <p>“When will their export be stopped?” he asked.</p>
      <p>Amnesty International backed Wong's plea to end the military training.</p>
      <p>“Given the current situation in Hong Kong, the German government should send a clear signal and immediately end any military cooperation,” Mathias John, an expert in arms and human rights at Amnesty International in Germany, told <i>Bild</i>.</p>
      <p>According to the daily, the German military plans to give 11 PLA soldiers logistics and senior officer training in 2020.</p>
      <p>Wong, 23, has visited several countries in recent months to drum up foreign support for Hong Kong's activists.</p>
      <p>He met with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas in September, prompting Beijing to summon Germany's ambassador in anger.</p>
      <p>In a separate interview to appear in today's edition of the German <i>Sueddeutsche</i> daily, Wong justified the use of violence against police by Hong Kong's anti-government demonstrators.</p>
      <p>“We won't achieve our goals through purely peaceful protest alone,” he said, in comments translated into German.</p>
      <p>“Nor through violence alone. We need both,” he added. — AFP</p>
