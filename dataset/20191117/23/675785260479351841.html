      <h1>Gareth Southgate's toughest week has shown him to be the ruthless manager England need</h1>
      <h2>This international break has been the first time Southgate has been heavily criticised for a decision as England manager amid the Joe Gomez and Raheem Sterling row</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:02:05+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:02</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Southgate finished the Euro 2020 qualifying ­campaign here last night on the back of his most difficult week as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/england-football-team">England</a> manager.</p>
      <p>As he stepped onto the pitch in the Fadil Vokrri Stadium, there must have been a sense of relief that it is over now and there is time to reflect upon the last seven days.</p>
      <p>The fall-out from the row between Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez was the ultimate test of any manager’s man-management skills and has certainly been a test for Southgate.</p>
      <p>This is a manager who, after all, is still learning on the job as he does not have the depth of managerial experience of recent England bosses like Roy Hodgson, Fabio Capello or Sven Goran Eriksson.</p>
      <p>They had long careers as club managers whereas Southgate has almost done it in reverse because, despite his spell in charge of Middlesbrough, his first big job was as England boss and, for the best part of three years, it has been plain sailing.</p>

      <p>That is perhaps why this week has come as such a shock: it is the first time he has come in for serious ­criticism, his handling of the situation has been under the microscope and, at times, he has looked stressed by the whole affair.</p>
      <p>Maybe Southgate’s biggest error was not to offer more of a public show of support for Gomez last week who, by every account, has acted impeccably and accepted Sterling’s handshake, apology and moved on for the good of the team while others might have been less forgiving.</p>
      <p>There must be lessons from this week. And unquestionably, Southgate has taken other ­pointers from his first three years in charge.</p>
      <p>If the England manager had been more effusive in his praise for Gomez then maybe the ­England fans would have realised he was not to blame.</p>

      <p>Southgate has changed as a ­manager even since the World Cup because he is now more guarded, more cautious and is more reserved.</p>
      <p>It is as if he wants to keep more of a distance and keep his thoughts to himself. He is also more self-assured and confident.</p>
      <p>Maybe that is why he is more suited to international management because there is more time to think, more time between games to come up with ­strategies and ideas. Southgate likes calm, not flashpoints.</p>
      <p>Southgate, 49, has also shown ­himself to be ruthless leader and is not afraid to make big decisions and choices which is the task facing him ahead of the pressures of next summer when England expects because much of the tournament is at Wembley.</p>
      <p>There are key questions in his ­starting XI and there is always a late push for a place in the squad ahead of any tournament.</p>
      <p>In 2016, it was Marcus Rashford. At last year’s World Cup it was Trent ­Alexander-Arnold. Perhaps next ­summer it might be Phil Foden.</p>

      <p>Now the challenge is to pick a ­settled XI and use it in the run-up to Euro 2020 with now just two friendlies in March remaining before the squad is named.</p>
      <p>The big questions are now at right-back, centre-half and central midfield.</p>
      <p>No-one can doubt that in Harry Kane, England have a world-class ­centre-forward, they have Sterling and other options with Jason Sancho, Rashford and Callum Hudson-Odoi.</p>
      <p>But the shape of the midfield – whether it will be a 4-2-3-1 formation with two deeper midfielders and a No.10 or a 4-3-3 with the emphasis on the front three – is a key dilemma.</p>
      <p>Is there a way back for Dele Alli and Jesse Lingard who were so influential in 2018?</p>

      <p>Alexander-Arnold is in pole ­position at right-back if he can ­reproduce his Liverpool form for ­England while Gomez would be Southgate’s first-choice partner for Harry Maguire if he is playing regularly for his club.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, John Stones and Tyrone Mings have a big ­opportunity.</p>
      <p>Harry Winks is now the preferred option as the No.6 or anchorman, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has the energy to run off him and James Maddison is playing well enough at Leicester to make a compelling case.</p>
      <p>With more young players coming off the St George’s Park production line, Southgate has no reason to look behind and can only look forward which is why next summer should be so exciting.</p>
