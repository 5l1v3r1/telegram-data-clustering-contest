      <h1>Hockey Hall of Fame 2019: Championship team-builder Jim Rutherford inadvertently changed the face of hockey — literally</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:07:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:07</time> by <a rel="author">Rudi Schuller</a></address>
      <p>In hockey circles, Jim Rutherford is known as a modern-day championship team builder. But three decades prior to raising the Stanley Cup as an executive, Rutherford had a massive influence on the sport in the unlikeliest of fashions.</p>
      <p>The current general manager of the Pittsburgh Penguins, Rutherford has overseen a pair oftitles in the Steel City. Go further back, and the 70-year-old is synonymous with the Carolina Hurricanes from the time the franchise moved south from Hartford in the late 1990s until well into this century. More specifically, Rutherford was the GM of the 2006 Stanley Cup-winning Hurricanes team that dominated from the start of that season to deliver a championship to a market that badly needed one.</p>
      <p>Rutherford's trademarks in management — shrewd scouting and timely trades — were developed throughout his time in Carolinaand put on display again in Pittsburgh with deals for the likes of Phil Kessel, and on Monday his prowess as anNHLexecutive will be recognized with an induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame.</p>
      <p>For all of Rutherford's accolades off the ice — a Hall of Fame plaque with his name onit is just the latest for the longtime GM —the man from Beeton, Ont., first made a name for himself on the ice.</p>

      <p>A veteran of 13 seasons, Rutherford's playing career saw the former goaltender make stops in Pittsburgh, Toronto and Los Angeles, but his biggest impact between the pipes was made for the Detroit Red Wings throughoutmost of the 1970s. Rutherford won151 regular-season NHL games in his playing career, making11,491 stops for an all-time save percentage of .879. His numbers were hardly anything to write home about, and Rutherford is certainly more well-known for his impact as a team-building executive than a shot-stopper.</p>
      <p>There's a reason he's being inducted into the Hall of Fame in the builders category, after all.</p>
      <p>However,most may not know that Rutherford inadvertently helped to build hockey in a different way. Coming of age as a professional goalie in the era where protective masks were just beginning to be accepted, a young Rutherford accidentally kicked off a revolution that literally changed the face of hockey forever.</p>
      <p>In 1974, the then 25-year-old Rutherford found himself in Detroit after nearly three seasons with the Penguins. He was sporting a plain goalie mask at the time, as was the norm, but the Pittsburgh powder blue-tinged face protector needed to be repurposed to represent the Red Wings. Rutherford called upon a young mask-maker, Greg Harrison, to make his equipment moreappropriate for Hockeytown.</p>
      <p>"That mask is actually his Pittsburgh mask, which I did first," Harrison told Sporting News, noting that he had just one night to sand down and repaint the banged-up mask so that Rutherford could use it in a game the next day. "I was doing it in my parents' garage at the time. So I hung up the mask at the end of the garage and I went, 'it needs something. I'm not sure what it needs, but it looks too plain.'"</p>
      <p>What Harrison came up with ended up being iconic, but neither he nor Rutherford thought much of it at the time.</p>
      <p>A Windsor, Ont. native, Harrison grew up a Red Wings fan, so it was obvious to the then 20-year-old what he could do to give the all-white mask a bit of personality.</p>
      <p>"I cut out a set of wings ... and I stuck them on the forehead over the eyes,and then held it up in my parents'garage and then I go, 'thatlooks pretty good,'" Harrison said. "I didn't call [Rutherford],I didn't ask him anything, I just drew them onby hand and then painted them and quickly baked it. And then that was ready to go the next morning andI brought it to him. And he didn't say much."</p>
      <p>Harrison had surprised the conservative Rutherford with the stylized design, and whywouldn't he besurprised by it? It was literally never before seen in the NHL, which was still in the midst of transitioning away from netminders risking teeth and eyes by not wearing any facial protection at all.</p>
      <p>Any masks at the time were purely functional. Artistic expression wasn't even a consideration at that point.</p>
      <p>As such, Rutherford faced a conundrum.</p>
      <p>"I've seen interviews with him before where he said he didn't like it because he didn't want to draw attention to himself," Harrison recalled. "But he only had the one mask, so he had no choice but to use it. So he put it on and he wore it,and immediately got attention for it. And over the next few days [he]decided he liked it, and other people liked it.</p>
      <p>"And it kind of started the [trend of] actual design images on masks."</p>

      <p>Almost immediately, goalies around the league started getting artwork on their masks.Rogie Vachon was next up, getting a pair of LA Kings crown logos above his eyes in a similar style to the Rutherford wings.Eddie Giacomin, Rutherford's back-up from the mid-70s through to his retirement in 1978, also sported a stylized pair of Red Wings.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, an ugly necessity that goaltenders begrudgingly accepted after dangerously risking their faces for decades was becoming a cool symbol of artistic expression for a position on the ice that wasn't previously known for its creativity. Goalie masks quickly became blank canvasses for Harrison and other artists, and the restrictive pieces of facial protection rocketed into the wider public consciousness as literal avatars for the sport itself.</p>
      <p>For Rutherford's part, he continued to use Harrison-designed masks throughout the rest of his playing career. The goaltender eventually became the executive, while Harrison's workbecame more intricate and functional as time went on — Harrison holdsEd Belfour's Eagleand Felix Potvin's Felix The Cat-inspired masksamong hisfavorite artwork, and he claims the cage combination mask that is now standard among netminders the world over as an evolution of his own design.</p>

      <p>Rutherford's career story is definedby deft draft-day transactions and astute team-building from the executive level, and that's what he'll rightfully be remembered for as his name enters the pantheon of legendary builders of the sport in the Hall of Fame. But before he put on a suit, Rutherford — along with a kid named Harrison —helped to build the culture of hockey in a completely different way, simply by donning a mask.</p>
