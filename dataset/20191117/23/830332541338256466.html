      <p>CINCINNATI, Ohio (CNN) - The <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/us/2019/10/04/cheetah-cub-and-puppy-friends-meade-mxp-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/atv-trending-videos/">Cincinnati Zoo</a> lost one of their special animal friends Sunday.</p>
      <p>Twelve-year-old Kimba the giraffe died after complications from a procedure to fix his hooves, the zoo <a href="https://twitter.com/CincinnatiZoo/status/1196127423328333825">said</a>.</p>
      <p>"Zoo staff, and especially the giraffe care team, are devastated," Michelle Curley, spokeswoman for the Cincinnati Zoo, told CNN.</p>
      <p>The Zoo Volunteer Observer (ZVO) team was monitoring the giraffe barn when they saw <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cincinnatizoo/photos/a.96076385478/10157642870735479/?type=3&amp;theater">Kimba</a> fall to the ground after 1 a.m. Sunday.</p>
      <p>Kimba was dealing with mobility issues when he was given a hoof trim Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"Kimba began intermittent bouts of lameness last summer, which we've been managing with laser therapy and medications that mitigate symptoms," said Cincinnati Zoo's curator of mammals Christina Gorsuch in a<a href="http://cincinnatizoo.org/news-releases/giraffe-foot-specialist-makes-house-call-to-perform-hoof-procedure-on-cincinnati-zoos-kimba/"> news release</a>.</p>
      <p>While the procedure was successful, there were later complications.</p>
      <p>Kimba, the zoo's only male giraffe, stood over 16 feet tall and was the father of six other giraffes, with a seventh on the way.</p>
      <p>The giraffe <a href="http://cincinnatizoo.org/news-releases/giraffe-foot-specialist-makes-house-call-to-perform-hoof-procedure-on-cincinnati-zoos-kimba/">came</a> to the Cincinnati Zoo in 2018 from the Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence, Rhode Island, where one his calves lives now.</p>
      <p>According to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the average life expectancy for male giraffes is 13.4 years.</p>
