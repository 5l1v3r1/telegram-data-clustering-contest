      <p>But tonight he was the main man at a huge headline gig for his loyal Scottish fan base.</p>
      <p>They roared him on as Be Someone - his popular collaboration with CamelPhat - blared in the background.</p>

      <p>Trouble Town and There’s a Beast and We All Feed It were to follow and fans went wild as pints went flying.</p>
      <p>Nottingham singer-songwriter Bugg released his new single Kiss Like The Sun this week.</p>
      <p>The new track has a country rock jam feel and it was the first taste of what’s to come from the 25-year-old in the new year.</p>
      <p>Despite only being released this week fans already knew the song word for word.</p>
      <h3>SET LIST</h3>
      <p>1. Be Someone</p>
      <p>2. Trouble Town</p>
      <p>3. There’s a Beast and We All Feed It</p>
      <p>4. Kiss Like The Sun</p>
      <p>5. Ballad of Mr Jones</p>
      <p>6. Slide</p>
      <p>7. Simple as This</p>

      <p>21. Simple Pleasures</p>
      <p>22. Two Fingers</p>
      <p>Classic Lightening Bolt was chanted as the iconic venue's roof prepared to be lifted.</p>
      <p>Bugg added: “Just want to say thank you cause every time I come up here it’s absolutely amazing”.</p>
      <p>Broken was up next and the way the rocker seamlessly moved between his electric and acoustic numbers was something to be admired.</p>
      <p>Two Fingers rounded off the Barrowlands set and the youthful crowd absolutely adored it.</p>
      <p>Jake Bugg fans are in for a treat if his latest album is anything like as good as his new tunes Kiss Like The Sun and Sing.</p>
      <p>Here’s hoping a return to Scotland is on the cards in 2020.</p>
