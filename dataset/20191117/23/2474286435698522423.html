      <p>Moree Plains Shire Council is currently calling for stall holders to participate in the annual Christmas at Twilight event next month.</p>
      <p>Set for Friday, December 13, <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/5814880/christmas-spirit-fills-the-air-at-twilight-carols-event-photos/#slide=7">Christmas at Twilight is a family-friendly event celebrating the festive season</a> with carols, stalls, rides and a fireworks display. Once again, a very important guest from the North Pole is also expected, should his busy pre-Christmas schedule permit.</p>
      <p>Moree mayor Katrina Humphries said the annual event is a great opportunity to share in the Christmas cheer.</p>
