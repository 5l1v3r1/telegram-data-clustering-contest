      <p>Logan Paul has announced he is launching an official appeal against KSI’s win in their recent boxing match.</p>
      <p>When they squared off at the Staples Center in Los Angeles earlier this month KSI came out victorious against his fellow YouTube star following a split decision.</p>
      <p>The American YouTuber was deducted two points in the match, which he has now said he feels he didn’t deserve.</p>
      <p>In a new video, Logan told his fans: ‘The punishment simply did not fit the crime’.</p>
      <p>He then addressed the referee for their clash, Jack Reiss, claiming Jack told him ‘if he’s made a mistake he’s down to correct it.’</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old said he had been inundated with messages from fans, friends and family saying that he should have won against KSI were it not for the two point deduction.</p>
      <p>He then revealed to his followers that his team will be contesting the result.</p>

      <p>Logan explained: ‘My team and I have decided to file an official appeal for the fight because we don’t believe the outcome is right.</p>

      <p>‘It just resonates with me to my core. One of my biggest fears about this is being a sore loser and that’s why i made this video a week after the fight.</p>
      <p>‘I really had to check myself and make sure I wasn’t doing this because I was afraid of losing.’</p>
      <p>He went on: ‘Historically I’ve taken big Ls. By no means am I afraid of losing. I welcome it because it’s the only way I tend to experience growth in my life. But I truthfully, 100 per cent believe I did not lost this fight.</p>
      <p>‘This is just a plea to the California State Athletic commission, I would just hope that you guys give this the weight it deserves.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile his brother Jake has previously made the bold claim that the match was ‘rigged’.</p>
      <p>The star added: ‘I believe in conspiracy theories and all the crazy stuff so I don’t put anything in this world past being true.’</p>

      <p>However he admitted that he had a new found respect for KSI, real name Olajide ‘JJ’ Olatunji, confessing: ‘I think KSI is a great fighter and I gained a level of respect I have for him that I didn’t have before.’</p>
