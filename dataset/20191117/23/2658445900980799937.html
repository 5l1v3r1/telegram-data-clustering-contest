        <i>The police officers who died while on active service between June 2019 till date have no insurance cover. This is due to the failure of the Federal Government to pay premium as at when due, <b>Omobola Tolu-Kusimo</b> writes.</i>

      <p>THE no premium, no cover policy of the insurance industry and the continuous default in payment of insurance premiums by the Federal Government have left many of its deceased personnels’ beneficiaries with no compensation.</p>
      <p>Presently, Nigeria police officers who died on duty from June 2019 till date have no insurance cover due to the non-payment of insurance premium on police officers by the Federal Government to insurance companies.</p>
      <p>Going by the policy of no premium, no cover enforced by the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM), no insurance policy must be sold on credit.</p>
      <p>A representative of the Nigeria Police Force Insurance Department, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Dr. A.M. Sulaiman revealed this during the 2019 Interactive Session with Major Consumers of Insurance Products organised by NAICOM in Lagos.</p>
      <p>The DCP said the police have been having problem with paying premiums promptly due to budgetary delay and urged NAICOM to wave the no premium, no cover policy in the favour of Nigerian Armed Forces, due to the peculiar nature of their job.</p>
      <p>NAICOM in 2013 enforced the ‘no premium, no cover’ policy on insurance accounts.</p>
      <p>The Commission noted that all insurance covers shall only be provided on a strict ‘no premium, no cover’ basis. It maintained that only cover for which payment has been received directly by the insurer or indirectly through a duly licensed insurance broker shall be recognised as income in the books of the insurer.</p>
      <p>NAICOM said any insurer who grants cover without having premium in advance or premium receipt notification from the relevant insurance broker shall be liable to a penalty of N500, 000 in respect of each cover so granted, and in addition, may be a ground for suspension of the license of the insurer.</p>
      <p>It said irrespective of period of insurance, insurers shall ensure that at any point they have received directly or indirectly, through the insurance broker the full premium in advance for cover being granted. NAICOM noted that all brokers shal within 48 hours of receiving premiums on behalf of any insurer; notify the insurer in writing in each case of the receipt of such premium, adding that all such notification shall be accompanied by the broker’s credit notes, acknowledging indebtedness to the insurer. It maintained that upon the receipt of such credit notes, the insurer shall issue cover and forward the policy documents along with the related debt notes to the broker.</p>
