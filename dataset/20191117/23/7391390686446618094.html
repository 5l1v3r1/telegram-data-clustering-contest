      <p>In my opinion: There's never a bad time for a taco. You can mix and match meats, cheeses, and veggies to make a hearty breakfast taco or a late-night snack. And they're even better wrapped in a fluffy, warm shell. The good news? The <a href="https://www.reviewed.com/cooking/best-right-now/the-best-tortilla-warmers">best tortilla warmers</a> keep your tortillas at the perfect temperature so you can have tacos morning, noon, and night.</p>
      <p>Tortilla warmers have long been a household staple in Mexico and in Mexican-influenced communities but they're now becoming increasingly popular as the appreciation for Mexican cuisine spreads. So, if you're new to using one there are a few things you should consider.</p>
      <p>Before you buy, you'll want to consider the material your warmer is made from. There are tons of options out there — everything from heavy <a href="https://heavy.com/home/2019/03/best-tortilla-warmer/">stone tortilla warmers</a> to fabric pouches that zip closed to hold in heat. Each has its own perks. Stone and ceramic warmers keep your tortillas from getting smushed and can keep heat in longer with a tight seal. On the other hand, a fabric pouch keeps heat without the bulk, and some reviewers say it leaves less condensation, too.</p>
      <p>Another thing to keep in mind is the size of your tortillas. Most <a href="https://foodieswiki.com/best-tortilla-warmer/">standard tortilla warmers</a> are only big enough to hold taco-sized tortillas without bending them around the edges. If you prefer burritos, or plan to use your warmer for pancakes or toast (totally plausible!), you may want to invest in an extra-large option or multiple warmers.</p>
      <p>The bottom line: If you love tacos, you definitely need one of the <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/rf-buying-guides/best-tortilla-warmers-reviews">best tortilla warmers</a>. Here's a round-up of some of the best options out there to kick Taco Tuesday up another notch.</p>

      <p><b>What fans say:</b> "My wife is from Mexico and loves to eat fresh hot tortillas. It is hard to believe this thing is really GREAT! We have a hard case one, and I am sorry...this one beats it by a mile. The tortillas stay pliant, moist, and hot inside this tortilla "blanky". No more folding up a kitchen towel. This works way better. I pinned it to the side of one of our kitchen cabinets and it looks like a sunburst decoration hanging there. No need to put it in a drawer!"</p>

I use mine for tortillas, pancakes, apple pie, chicken, pork chops, fried potatoes, and the list could go on! Easy to clean. Definitely a must in every kitchen!"</p>
