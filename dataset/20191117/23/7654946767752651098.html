      <h1>Cab driver wanted for Bronx stabbing says he’s the victim</h1>

      <p>A cabbie accused of stabbing a Bronx man says police got the story backwards — and that he was only defending himself from a fare-beater who attacked him.</p>
      <p>Sandy de Jesus Rodriguez — who says he plans on turning himself in to cops on Monday — is wanted for allegedly slashing a guy inside a Bronx apartment building on Oct. 13.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Rodriguez said he was defending himself after the man and his gal pal stole $190 from him and attacked him when he tried to get it back.</p>
      <p>“I did have a small pocket knife with me, but I used it only to intimidate the man and try to get my money back, but I did not stab him,” de Jesus Rodriguez said.</p>
      <p>The hack said the alleged fare-beaters ditched him four months earlier without paying when he dropped them off in White Plains, but he didn’t realize the woman he picked up Oct. 13 was a member of the dastardly duo until it was too late.</p>
      <p>“Those people knew what they were doing, because they called the base through a private number. It was premeditated,” he said.</p>
      <p>De Jesus Rodriguez said he brought the gal pal to her destination — where her beau was waiting inside the building — and the woman took off from the cab, claiming that she had to get money to cover the fare.</p>
      <p>“I went to get something from the side of the seat and with a flash the woman was out of the car,” de Jesus Rodriguez said. “I looked back and she was gone, and I looked at my cup holder where I keep my money and that was gone too.”</p>
      <p>He said he went inside the building to get his money back, only to be greeted by the man from the previous ride.</p>
      <p>“When I confronted them and told them that they were the same couple from White Plains, the man immediately bum-rushed me, and the woman ran towards the elevators,” de Jesus Rodriguez said.</p>
      <p>He said they engaged in a “brief scuffle,” and he pulled out his pocket knife to get the man to back off him.</p>
      <p>“Not one time did I lay a hand on him,” the cab driver said. “I did not hit him or stab him unless he intentionally cut himself to make it look like I did but I did not cut him in any way.”</p>
      <p>De Jesus Rodriguez said he wasn’t aware that cops were looking for him until they released a video of the scuffle last week.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to turn myself in tomorrow at the precinct, because I already gave my word and I have to confront this problem,” he said. “I’m 100-percent certain that the police will find out that guy’s lying once we get the medical records.”</p>
      <p>The NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
