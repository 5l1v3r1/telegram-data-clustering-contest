      <p>VANCOUVER - Warnings about service cancellations on some Metro Vancouver transit routes on Monday and Tuesday during an ongoing labour dispute have been withdrawn.</p>
      <p>Transit operator TransLink says SeaBus service cancellations announced earlier for Monday and Tuesday will now not go ahead and the service will operate on its regular schedule.</p>
      <p>TransLink says staffing issues connected to the earlier announcement about cancellations and schedule changes have been resolved.</p>
      <p>Talks collapsed last week between Unifor, which represents bus drivers, mechanics and SeaBus operators, and Coast Mountain, which handles Lower Mainland transit on behalf of TransLink.</p>
      <p>The union says Coast Mountain remains unwilling to discuss wages, a key issue in the dispute, while Coast Mountain counters its proposal is well above increases offered to other public-sector workers in British Columbia.</p>
      <p>Union officials said last week bus drivers will refuse overtime on Monday, Wednesday and Friday of next week if the dispute is not settled.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 17, 2019.</p>
