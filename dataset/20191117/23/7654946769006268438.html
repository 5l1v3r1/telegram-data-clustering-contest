      <h1>Jets report card: Nearly perfect performance has one blemish</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:07:25+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:07</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Costello</a></address>
      <p>Grading the Jets after their <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/sam-darnolds-career-day-leads-jets-in-easy-win-over-redskins/">34-17 win over the Washington Redskins</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <h3>Offense</h3>
      <p>The Jets put together their best performance of the season, rolling up 400 yards for the first time. QB Sam Darnold (19 of 30, 293 yards, 4 TDs, 1 INT, 121.2 rating) was not spectacular, but he set a career-high for touchdowns and protected the ball outside of one terrible throw. TE Ryan Griffin (5 catches, 109 yards, 1 TD) was Darnoldâ€™s favorite target. The running game was better than it has been, rushing for a season-high 115 yards.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Grade: A-</i>
      </p>
      <h3>Defense</h3>
      <p>Redskins QB Dwayne Haskins (19-of-35, 214 yards, 2 TDs, 1 INT, 79.9 rating) looked confused by the Jets defense until he padded his stats in garbage time. The Jets sacked Haskins six times, three by safety Jamal Adams. They held Washington to 225 total yards and just 54 yards rushing. LB Neville Hewitt made his second interception of the year.</p>

      <h3>Special Teams</h3>
      <p>Kicker Sam Ficken missed an extra point and a field goal. It did not matter since the Jets were in control of the game, but the kicking game remains an issue. Vyncint Smith fumbled on a kickoff return, a turnover that could have been deadly if the Redskins had any offensive execution at all.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Grade: D</i>
      </p>
      <h3>Coaching</h3>
      <p>Yes, the Redskins are terrible, but give the Jets coaches credit for having their team ready and taking care of business against a bad team. Adam Gase had a strong plan on offense and Gregg Williams baffled Haskins on defense. Gase has kept the team together through a trying season and it is still playing hard for him.</p>
