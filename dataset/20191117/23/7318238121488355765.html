      <h1>German children fish out WWII ammunition from pond</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:44:53+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:44</time> by <a rel="author">EuronewsÂ </a></address>
      <p>Three children fished out World War Two ammunition from a pond in Germany, police revealed on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The incident took place in Ohrdruf, a town in the east-central state of Thuringia.</p>
      <p>The three children reeled out ammunition and bullet fragments from the pond by using a strong magnet, local police said <a href="https://thueringen.de/dpa-meldungen/kinder-angeln-weltkriegs-munition-aus-teich-6367/">in a statement</a>.</p>
      <p>Once they realised what they had dragged out, they called the police who locked the site down and disposed of the equipment. No one was hurt.</p>
      <p>Police warned people against "such recreational activities" and stressed that they should leave any ammunition they come across on the spot they were found and immediately call the authorities.</p>
      <p>Seventy-five years after the end of WWII, unexploded bombs are regularly found across the country. Earlier this year, 16,000 people had to be evacuated in Frankfurt while experts defused a 500 kilogramme WWII bomb found near the European Central bank.</p>
