      <p>Who would have thought a matinee game vs the Kings would be so damn entertaining?</p>
      <p>The Celtics’ 10 game winning streak ended today (100-99) when a Marcus Smart floater bounded around and off the rim as the final horn sounded.</p>
      <p>Boston didn’t bring its best (11 1st half TOs) as the Kings led by double-digits for a good portion of the 1st half. The Celtics found some semblance of their groove in the 2nd half, but couldn’t snuff out the hot-shooting of Buddy Hield (35 points) and Bogdan Bogdanovic (10 pts in the 4th). Boston’s perimeter defense was a problem as the Kings shot 40% from 3.</p>
      <p>Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 18 points and Daniel Theis notched a double-double (14 points, 10 rebounds). But the subpar and subdued efforts from Smart (5 points, 2-16 FG), Jayson Tatum (14 points), and Kemba Walker (15 points, 5-12 FG) were too much to overcome.</p>

      <p>Just look at this rebound by Smart. If only he considered dribbling out or calling a time-out.</p>
