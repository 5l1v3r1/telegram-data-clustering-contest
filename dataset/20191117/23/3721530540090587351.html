      <p>On the two-year anniversary of its premiere, hardcore <i>Justice League </i>fans got their longstanding demand to “release the Snyder cut” of the film trending on Twitter. Then they got Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot — Batman and Wonder Woman in the DC Cinematic Universe — to co-sign it.</p>

      <p>Gadot tweeted in support of the fan culture movement earlier this afternoon, adopting a hashtag tweeted by the hardest of hardcore DC Cinematic Universe fans for the past two years. Affleck followed afterward; neither actor gave any further comment or explanation.</p>
      <p>“The Snyder Cut” is supposedly the version of <i>Justice League </i>that director Zack Snyder had in mind, before leaving the project in post-production to be with his family after his daughter died in the spring of 2017.</p>
      <p>Joss Whedon instead made the film’s final cut, with industry chatter since saying he was under orders to trim <i>Justice League’s</i> time and give it a sunnier disposition. Fans have assumed Snyder’s original vision exists, in a releasable state, and they were agitating for it even before <i>Justice League</i>’s Nov. 17, 2017 launch. Ever since, The Snyder Cut has, as so many things do with pop culture fandom, taken a kind of mythic status, akin to Richard Donner’s director’s cut of <i>Superman 2 </i>from 1980 — which ultimately was released in 2006.</p>
      <p>The #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement has had <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/19/17591154/release-the-snyder-cut-justice-league-zack-snyder-joss-whedon-sdcc">plenty of toxic moments on social media</a>, making Gadot’s endorsement all the more eyebrow-raising. But it’s also had better ones. This summer, fans got a crowdfunding campaign going before San Diego Comic-Con, raising enough money to buy Times Square billboards before New York Comic Con, reportedly donating more than $100,000 to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention as well (Snyder’s daughter, Autumn, died by suicide in March 2017).</p>
      <p>Warner Bros. has said it doesn’t have any plans to release Snyder’s version. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477511/kevin-smith-says-zack-snyder-cut-of-justice-league-is-real-studio-would-be-silly-not-to-release-it">In a podcast with CinemaBlend</a> this year, the director Kevin Smith said that such a cut does exist, but it’s most likely raw footage, not anything finished or compiled for mass consumption.</p>
      <p>Fans at large seem not to be aware, or interested, in such a film. We <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/22/17600376/snyder-cut-san-diego-comic-con-zack-snyder-joss-whedon-dc-warner-bros">polled a bunch during San Diego Comic-Con 2018</a> for their feelings on “The Snyder Cut,” and heard a lot of indifference.</p>
      <p>“Their force comes from the perception that they are huge in number, when they are really not,” Bob Rehak, a Swarthmore College researcher who studies fan culture, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/22/17600376/snyder-cut-san-diego-comic-con-zack-snyder-joss-whedon-dc-warner-bros">told Polygon at the time</a>. “That’s just as important as acknowledging their campaigns, and their presence.”</p>
      <p><b>Update:</b> Snyder himself weighed in, by retweeting Gadot with comment:</p>
