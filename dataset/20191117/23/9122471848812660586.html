      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:38:30+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa will have surgery on his dislocated hip on Monday, the program announced tonight.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa has been hospitalized in Birmingham since suffering the season-ending injury in yesterday’s win over Mississippi State. He is expected to make a full recovery.</p>
      <p>Tonight, Alabama announced in a statement that Tagovailoa will be transported to Houston for surgery tomorrow.</p>
      <p>“For the past 24 hours our medical team has consulted with multiple orthopedic experts across the country, who specialize in hip injuries and surgeries,” said team orthopedic surgeon Lyle Cain. “Based on that research, Tua is being flown to Houston tonight to be evaluated and is scheduled to have hip surgery Monday.”</p>

      <p>Tagovailoa went down late in the first half against the Bulldogs. Nick Saban revealed after the game that he planned to remove the junior star after that two-minute drill series because the game was out of hand.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa has been the recipient of hundreds of inspirational messages and get well wishes over the last 24 hours.</p>
      <p>“Thank you all for the prayers and well wishes! God always has a plan,” he tweeted last night.</p>

      <p>Without Tagovailoa, backup Mac Jones will lead the Crimson Tide during the final two weeks of the regular season.</p>
      <p>Alabama remains in the hunt for the College Football Playoff, though they may ultimately find themselves on the outside looking in.</p>
