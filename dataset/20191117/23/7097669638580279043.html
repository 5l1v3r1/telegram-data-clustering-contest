      <h1>Mom gets a laugh from charge she's carrying a doll to steal yogurt: 'My baby is 100% real'</h1>

      <p>LACEY, New Jersey — Mothers can't catch a break.</p>
      <p>It's a lesson<a href="https://bit.ly/2OmBNmB"> Patricia Larkin learned</a> after a woman at a New Jersey Aldi store accused her of carrying a fake baby to try and steal yogurt.</p>
      <p>Larkin, of Lacey, New Jersey, said in the Facebook group "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/LaceyChatter/permalink/2630787800292679/">Lacey Township Chatter</a>" that she was grocery shopping with her infant when a woman told a cashier that her baby was fake and an attempt to "smuggle yogurts out of the store."</p>
      <p>Larkin, despite being fatigued from staying up nights with her 2-month-old daughter, responded to the accusation with humor. She posted a picture of herself smiling while holding her sleeping baby in front of the store's sign.</p>
      <p>"Thank you for the laugh," she wrote in the Facebook group. "1) My baby is 100% real. 2) Yogurts are like $.25 at Aldi. 3) I'm lactose intolerant and don't consume any dairy at all."</p>
      <p>Larkin said a similarly amused cashier told her about the woman's accusation, by which time, her infant daughter was crying and fussing like only a real baby could.</p>
      <p>Within an hour of sharing her experience, Larkin's post had gone viral with more than 450 reactions, 80+ comments, and numerous shares.</p>
      <p>Local residents were eager to weigh in.</p>
      <p>A commenter with the username Manda Louisee wrote: "Cutest fake baby I've ever seen."</p>
      <p>Commenter Robin Enquist McAndrew wrote: "I would've went with 'butterball turkey'... What a cutie."</p>
      <p>Larkin says she is taking the experience as a compliment, one that means her daughter is so cute, she has been mistaken for a doll. </p>
