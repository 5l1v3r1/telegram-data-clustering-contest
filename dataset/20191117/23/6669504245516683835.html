      <p>The 35th annual Kalamalka Rotary Dream Auction was a record-setter with almost $340,000 raised Saturday.</p>
      <p>“The money raised at the Dream Auction enables Kalamalka Rotary to support dozens of worthy community and international projects each year,” President Carmen Larsen said in a press release. “Over these 35 years, Kal Rotary has donated a cumulative total of over $4.4 million to local and international non-profit organizations."</p>
      <p>One of such projects is the Starfish Backpack Program launched by Kal Rotary in 2016. Through the program, students in need receive a backpack full of food to take home for the weekend. The showcase auction was introduced by 65 students from La Chorale de Beairsto, led by Anita Baturin, who sang We are the World to guests. The equivalent of 111 backpacks, or $64,250, was raised Saturday and will be put in an endowment fund to provide long-term program funding, Kal Rotary said in a release.</p>

      <p>“This event is only possible with the generous contributions from Greater Vernon businesses and others farther afield who demonstrate their support year after year,” said Brian Reid, chair. “We also want to thank our guests who big on these items in the night of the auction and help us raise these funds.”</p>
      <p>Community groups can apply for grants until the end of December. Details are available online through <a href="http://www.kalrotary.org/">Kalamalka Rotary’s website</a>.</p>
