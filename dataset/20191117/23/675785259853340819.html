      <h1>Footballer called "pathetic little man" by opposition boss after being racially abused</h1>
      <h2>Ahmad Mendes Moreira left the field as the game against Den Bosch was halted before returning to score. But coach of the opposition, Erik van der Ven, criticised the player</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:04:56+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:04</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>Dutch footballer Ahmad Mendes Moreira has told of his "hurt" after being labelled a "pathetic little man" in the aftermath of receiving racist abuse.</p>
      <p>The Excelsior striker lined up for his team away at Den Bosch in the Dutch first division on Sunday, but left the field after being abused by the home fans.</p>
      <p>He stormed off as the referee called a temporary halt to the clash at Den Bosch's De Vliert stadium, but returned soon after to score for his team.</p>
      <p>But Den Bosch coach Erik van der Ven blasted Moreira as a "pathetic little man" for his actions during the match.</p>
      <p>Speaking in a post match press conference, Moreira said: "That just hurts me a lot."</p>
      <p>The match eventually ended in a 3-3 draw, after Excelsior fought back from 2-1 down following Moreira's goal, and then levelling late on through Ruben Rodrigues.</p>
      <p>With the scores at 1-1 earlier in the match, Moreira gave away a foul over by the touchline, before he was shouted at by Den Bosch supporters sitting nearby.</p>
      <p>Moreira - whose parents hail from the West African nations of Bissau-Guinea and Guinea respectively - naturally reacted angrily to the abuse.</p>
      <p>He was escorted off the pitch by sympathetic teammates before a lengthy break, during which the match looked as though it could be abandoned.</p>

      <p>However the game soon resumed and Moreira quickly provided the best response, scoring and cupping his ears in celebration.</p>
      <p>Objects were hurled at the 24-year-old and his teammates as they celebrated.</p>
      <p>Former Man Utd star Memphis Depay reacted to the incident on social media, tweeting: "I'm sick and tired to see these images over and over! When is it going to stop!!? #SayNoToRacism."</p>
      <p>He then tweeted the Dutch FA, saying: "What we doing to do? Specially with the upcoming Euro 2020?"</p>
      <p>Den Bosch released a statement after the fixture condemning the behaviour of their fans.</p>
      <p>It read: "Let one thing be clear; FC Den Bosch distances itself from everything that has to do with this and acts strongly against stadium visitors who are guilty of this."</p>
      <p>It is the latest occurrance of racism in football following a recent spate of similar incidents.</p>
      <p>The England national team were subjected to abuse in Bulgaria last month, while an FA Cup tie between Haringey Borough and Yeovil Town was called off days later.</p>
