      <h1>“Hasn’t taken his chance” – Roy Keane blasts Chelsea’s Hudson-Odoi after England performance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:55:44+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:55</time> by <a rel="author">Jaikuran Randhawa</a></address>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10365334/callum-hudson-odoi-slammed-by-roy-keane-as-chelsea-starlet-fails-to-impress-for-england-vs-kosovo/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574026807">the Sun</a>, Manchester United legend Roy Keane believes that Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi didn’t “take his chance” to establish himself as a serious contender to start for England with his performance against Kosovo this evening.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old starlet was replaced by Marcus Rashford in the 59th minute of the match. Keane critiqued Hudson-Odoi’s performance at halftime whilst covering the game for ITV.</p>
      <p>Tonight’s outing saw Hudson-Odoi pick up his third senior cap for the Three Lions and it was clear that the ace wasn’t as frightening as he usually is going forward.</p>
      <p>The Chelsea academy graduate will be hoping to secure a place in Gareth Southgate’s Euro 2020 squad next summer. Keane hinted that he needs to “step up his game.”</p>

        <b>Here’s what the Irishman had to say about the Chelsea starlet:</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Hudson-Odoi hasn’t taken his chance yet. He isn’t stretching the defence and has given the ball away too cheaply.”</p>
      <p>“He needs to step his game up in the second half.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ex-Arsenal star Lee Dixon also echoed Keane’s concern on the winger, here’s what he said, quotes from the Sun:</b>
      </p>
      <p>“There are only two games left before the squad is announced.”</p>
      <p>“He needs to just run at his full-back. He has to attack more rather than playing the ball inside.”</p>
      <p>Some of the criticism towards the ace seems to be a bit harsh given that he only returned to action in September having been out since April.</p>
      <p>It would take any player time to get back up to speed, least of all a raw young prospect.</p>
      <p>Hudson-Odoi’s hopes of getting back to his best have perhaps been hindered by the competition he’s facing at Chelsea.</p>
      <p>Veteran winger Willian and American superstar Christian Pulisic are currently in fine form and this has seen Hudson-Odoi start only 5 of his 11 appearances for Frank Lampard’s side so far this season.</p>
      <p>Whilst his outing for England wasn’t his best, this will surely help the ace find his rhythm again – we’re sure he’ll be back to his best with time.</p>
