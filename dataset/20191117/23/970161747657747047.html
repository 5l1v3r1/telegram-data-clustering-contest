      <p>Michy Batshuayi insists he will stay loyal to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> and ‘feels at home’ at the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> club despite his lack of starts under Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>Belgium striker Batshuayi has endured a frustrating spell at Stamford Bridge since completing a £33million move from Ligue 1 side Marseille in 2016.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old has been sent out on three separate loan spells – to Borussia Dortmund, Valencia and Crystal Palace – and is yet to start a match for Chelsea so far this season.</p>

      <p>Batshuayi – along with French striker Olivier Giroud – has been forced to play back-up to in-form England striker Tammy Abraham and has been persistently linked with a move during the January transfer window.</p>

      <p>But he said: ‘I have never been a full-fledged starter, but Chelsea is my club, that’s where I feel at home. It’s a club I love deeply.’</p>
      <p>Batshuayi also revealed how he has matured as a professional footballer, adding: ‘When I was young, it’s true that I had some problems of discipline.</p>

      <p>‘But what young person doesn’t? Today, I’m 26 years old, I can channel myself and I work at training and in the game.’</p>
      <p>Batshuayi is seen as a playful character both on and off the pitch and said: ‘That is true, but I choose my moments: at 0-0 I’m going to be serious, at 2 or 3-0 I’m going to play it up.</p>
      <p>‘Being cool is part of my personality. But it’s true: the pressure of football imposes the need to perform and win. The competition is raging, and seriousness is needed.’</p>
      <p>Chelsea visit Premier League champions Manchester City following the conclusion of the international break.</p>
