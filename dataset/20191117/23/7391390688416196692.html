      <p>For those who struggle to fall asleep easily (I'm with you), there are a lot of products out there that claim to help. From a <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/do-weighted-blankets-work-i-tried-this-best-selling-weighted-blanket-heres-what-happened-18568020">weighted blanket</a> that reduces nighttime restlessness, to a <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-4-best-white-noise-machines-for-sleep-9938716">white noise machine</a> that drowns out distracting sounds, the sleep science industry is big and wide. But, there aren't many products that have thousands of reviews testifying to how well they work. This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078SS8T3T/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-19301867-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07B45PSV8&amp;linkId=7962ecf44229d9675bf1a5eb1edacb1a">genius sleep aid supplement</a> is one of them.</p>

And, while any supplement will boast some lofty claims, reviewers say these check out. Over 3,000 Amazon reviewers have weighed in with many of them saying these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078SS8T3T/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-19301867-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07B45PSV8&amp;linkId=7962ecf44229d9675bf1a5eb1edacb1a">supplements helped improve the quality of sleep</a>, curb nighttime anxiety and stress, and even allowed them to wake up more refreshed. Bonus: Not only are they vegan, but these supplements are also made without any GMOs (<a href="https://ag.purdue.edu/GMOs/Pages/WhatareGMOs.aspx">genetically modified organisms</a>).</p>

      <p>How these work:<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078SS8T3T/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-19301867-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07B45PSV8&amp;linkId=7962ecf44229d9675bf1a5eb1edacb1a"> Take two capsules 30 minutes before your bedtime</a> and you'll slowly start to feel more tired and ready for sleep. While these don't rely on habit-forming drugs like some doctor-prescribed sleep medications, the manufacturer recommends taking these no more than five nights a week. Word to the wise: Before introducing a new supplement to your diet, it's always best check in with your doctor or trusted health professional. Here's a helpful resource if you have questions about <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/sleep-aids/art-20047860">whether a sleep aid or supplement is right</a> for you.</p>
      <p>As with any sleep aid you're thinking of trying, you'll want to read extensively through the reviews (I have you covered here.) I combed through thousands of Amazon reviews and was shocked to find so many fans who say these work better than over-the-counter name brands out there. According to one reviewer, "As a long time user of Lunesta, Ambien and Tylenol Pm I was skeptical Genius Sleep Aid would help much. I took 2 capsules, the recommended dosage, and did have an easier time falling asleep. Although I frequently still woke up through the night. I bumped it up to 3 capsules, and that did the trick. Was able to fall asleep within 30 mins and have been able to sleep through the night. But what I am enjoying most is not waking up with my head in a fog and groggy. Highly recommend Genius Sleep Aid if you suffer from insomnia or other sleeping issues."</p>
      <p>In addition to 1 milligram of melatonin, the unique formula of this supplement is packed with amino acids like <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/glycine">L-glycine</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6366437/">L-theanine</a>, that <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/l-theanine">help regulate sleep</a> for a longer and more consistent night of rest. And, while this formula is tried and true for thousands of people, if it doesn't suit you or help improve the quality of your sleep, the manufacturer has a money-back guarantee.</p>
      <p>These <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078SS8T3T/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-19301867-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07B45PSV8&amp;linkId=7962ecf44229d9675bf1a5eb1edacb1a">sleep aid supplements</a> might be just the ticket to help you rest more soundly throughout the night. And, at just $20, they're definitely a product worth trying if you struggle to get a good night's sleep.</p>
