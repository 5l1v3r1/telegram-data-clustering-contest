      <h1>Caitlyn Jenner's secret support to Kanye West during I'm A Celebrity launch</h1>
      <h2>The Keeping Up With The Kardashians was keeping close to her extended family as she entered the Australian jungle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:23:38+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:23</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror .co.uk</a></address>
      <p>Caitlyn Jenner was a hit on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! during the 2019 launch - and some eagle eyed viewers noticed she paid tribute to son-in-law <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> as she made her entry to the show.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">The 70-year-old former Olympian</a> is <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">one of the 10 contestants taking part in the latest series</a> - but is still possibly best known for featuring on Keeping Up With The Kardashians.</p>
      <p>After marrying Kris Kardashian in 1991, Caitlyn (then known as Bruce Jenner) became step father to Kardashians Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob - before welcoming daughters Kendal and Kyle Jenner with Kris.</p>
      <p>Kim, 39, married her third husband, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kanye-west">42-year-old Kanye West</a> in 2014 - with the rap star known for both his music and his fashion designing.</p>

      <p>Taking to the beach in Australia at the beginning of series 19 of I’m A Celeb, Cait sported a pair of trainers designed by Kanye - Yeezy’s (which cost hundreds of pounds) as she made her entrance.</p>
      <p>The fashion choice didn’t go unnoticed by fans of the long running ITV reality show - with many taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to point out the celebrity connection.</p>
      <p>“Is Caitlyn Jenner wearing YEEZY’S on I’m a celeb,” gasped one impressed fan.</p>

      <p>“Love how caitlyn jenner is wearing yeezy’s,” tweeted another.</p>
      <p>While a third wrote: “Caitlyn Jenner wearing yeezy’s on #ImACeleb has made my day.”</p>
      <p>Caitlyn’s journey on the show has been action packed so far - and it has only been one day.</p>

      <p>Viewers saw the reality star legend arrive on a sandy beach via speedboat, parachute from a helicopter, and get stranded on Snake Rock with other suffering celebrities.</p>
      <p>The suffering is going to get worse for the American star, however, as she was selected to be the first celebrity to face a bush tucker trial alongside Good Morning Britain star Kate Garraway.</p>
