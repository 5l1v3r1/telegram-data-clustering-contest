      <p>Referring to the demand of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti government to accord national status to the Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project, he said that neither the Congress nor the BJP had promised national status to the project; the Polavaram project has been given national status as it was mentioned under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. He said Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao should have pressed for including national status to the Kaleswaram project in the AP Reorganisation Act during the bifurcation process. He made it clear that “there is no proposal to make Hyderabad the second capital of the country.”</p>
      <p>Mr Reddy said that the Road Transport Corporation strike is a subject under the state government and it is for the chief minister to resolve the issue. He alleged that the issue is becoming more complicated by the day and the people and RTC workers are facing severe hardships. Referring to the division of the RTC between Telangana state and Andhra Pradesh, he said the two Chief Ministers must sit down and complete the RTC bifurcation process.
