      <p>THE SECOND edition of Yog Mahotsav, Pune’s own yoga festival, was held at the Poona Club, Camp, on Sunday. It was inaugurated by Subodh Tiwari, CEO of Kaivalyadham Yoga Institute, Lonavala, one of the oldest yoga institutions in India, and Sai Susarla, dean, MIT School of Vedic Sciences.</p>
      <p>“Over 300 yoga enthusiasts from across the city took part in this health event as yoga has quickly gained popularity as a form of exercise. We both worked in the corporate sector for a really long time but now we both have a combined experience of 20 years of teaching yoga. The lack of knowledge and awareness makes people believe that yoga is just asanas; however, that’s just superficial. We want people to have the curiosity and learn more about it. We want people to take back knowledge after being exposed to it as many people have preconceived notions about yoga being slow or boring or meant only to stretch the body or meant only for women, which is not the case. In today’s life, people are prone to stress and illness. Yoga heals the body and the mind,” said Sarika Vasudev and Zahabbiya Walbeek, who have conceptualised this festival.</p>
      <p>“Seeing the uniformly positive response, a plan was made to create a larger space and explore more themes in 2019. In this edition of the Mahotsav, we had 23 experts, doctors, yoga and meditation teachers come on the same platform to teach, learn and interact with each other in a relaxed, comfortable environment. We had sessions on different forms of meditation to de-stress, importance of strength in asanas, facets from dance movement therapy to Sanskrit — the language of yoga — and such sessions conducted by experts, philosophers and doctors. To do this, we needed to organise an event that showcases the best aspects of yoga in Pune. Even if people take back 10 per cent from this event, our aim is accomplished. We want Pune to become the spiritual yoga capital of the country. People end up going to Rishikesh or down south in search of yoga but Pune has so much to offer. We might conduct monthly sessions to ensure that our efforts stay alive with the Pune audience,” they added.</p>
