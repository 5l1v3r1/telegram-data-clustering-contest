      <h1>Parker: The Dorian breaks ground on 5th Avenue</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:45:30+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:45</time> by <a rel="author">David Parker, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>The Calgary job market is getting a boost with the start of construction of the The Dorian hotel, a luxury development by PBA Land and Development that will, at peak, employ 120 EllisDon crew and create more than 150 new jobs when it opens in the spring of 2022.</p>
      <p>Workers are now busy on the site just to the east of the corner of 5<sup>th</sup> Avenue and 5<sup>th</sup> Street S.W. — which has been a surface parking lot for nearly 40 years — shoring the perimeter to begin excavating four storeys down for the underground parkade that will provide 75 stalls for guests.</p>
      <p>EllisDon has been assisting PBA’s senior vice-president of land and development, Andrew Boblin, along with designer Gibbs Gage Architects, for the past 18 months preparing to break ground on this major central downtown tower that will be a dramatic addition to Calgary’s skyline.</p>
      <p>“Building a new hotel at this time means we are looking into the future, as we see real opportunity in tourism that will translate into billions of dollars in economic activity for this city,” says Boblin.</p>
      <p>The Dorian brings the city a total of 307 new guest rooms in its 27-storey tower, including 133 luxury Marriott Autograph plus 174 Marriott Courtyard rooms, helping satisfy the need for higher-end hotel inventory in the core.</p>
      <p>Visitor spending is expected to grow to $2.1 billion by end of this year, and the number of almost eight million visitors is forecasted to grow again next year.</p>
      <p>“We work with partners to develop tourism experiences and support the local economy,” says Cindy Ady, CEO of Tourism Calgary. “We know The Dorian will add to the diverse range of shareable, memorable experiences available to visitors and Calgarians. We look forward to watching the luxury hotel become part of the city’s skyline.”</p>
      <p>Really two hotels in one, Boblin says The Dorian Autograph, on floors 15 to 27, will blend design-forward architecture with unique tailored experiences — putting it in a class with some of the best hotels in Chicago and Shanghai. The rooms will bring unique and distinctive features, blending a mixture of British charm — rich textures and patterns such as tweed and houndstooth, and deep colours of purple, turquoise and blue — combined with crisp, modern design.</p>
      <p>The Marriott Courtyard on the lower portion of the tower rises from the third floor above the main-floor lobby and second-floor bistro, also accessed through the Plus-15 system.</p>
      <p>An exciting destination for visitors, The Dorian will also be a fabulous place for locals to gather, featuring a 27<sup>th</sup> floor resto-lounge with a south-facing outdoor patio.</p>
      <p>“This project is not proceeding on hope,” Boblin says. “As an organization, we have seen the resiliency of the Calgary market over the past 50 years. Our market research shows that more people are coming to Calgary and business is happening. This hotel will help serve that growth.”</p>
      <p>Destined to be one of the most prominent structures in the city, the hotel presents a great show of confidence by PBA, a 54-year-old real estate company with deep roots in the Calgary community.</p>
