        <b>With improved pacing, sublime storylines and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/18/ben-martin-callum-bobby-new-dynamics-made-eastenders-great-10905090/">incredible new dynamics</a>, EastEnders has well and truly gone from strength to strength this year. Yes, under <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-oates/">Kate Oates</a> and Jon Sen’s leadership, the BBC One stop has thrived, and it would appear as if it’s going to continue to do so, as actor Jake Wood has promised exciting things for the serial drama’s highly-anticipated 35<sup>th </sup>anniversary next year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking about the current high standard of the soap, actor Jake Wood told Metro.co.uk: ‘I think the show is in a really really strong position at the moment — maybe the strongest it’s been since I’ve been there. I think Kate Oates has done a fantastic job, and Jon Sen. Even just the look of it — like Mel leaving this week. The show is really strong, I think they’re really raising their game.’</p>
      <p>Jake’s got a point. From the reintroduction of characters such as Ben Mitchell (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/max-bowden/">Max Bowden</a>) and Sean Slater (Rob Kazinksy), to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/06/eastenders-spoilers-hunter-owen-dies-after-being-shot-with-a-machine-gun-10621096/">unforgettable siege in The Queen Vic orchestrated by Hunter Owen</a> (Charlie Winter) — not to mention <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/05/eastenders-lgbtqi-pride-episode-perfect-television-time-need-10123091/">the spectacular Pride episode</a> — EastEnders has well and truly went from strength to strength under Kate and Jon’s guidance. In fact, to use that old EastEnders slogan, everyone is talking about it again.</p>

      <p>Jake continued: ‘This year’s really strengthened what we’ve got, and Christmas and the 35<sup>th</sup>anniversary next year — it’s going to be an incredible six months, or year, ahead.’</p>

      <p>Yes, Christmas is approaching, and — given that it tends to be something of an unforgettable time of year for those who dwell in Walford — this one will no doubt be explosive.</p>
      <p>We know that the truth about Sharon (Letitia Dean) and Keanu’s (Danny Walters) affair will <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/09/eastenders-boss-reveals-sharon-mitchell-and-keanu-taylors-affair-will-explode-at-christmas-10686692/">come to light</a>, not to mention the fact that Sharon’s baby is Keanu’s and not Phil’s (Steve McFadden) — <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/eastenders-spoilers-phil-mitchell-discovers-truth-sharon-baby-mel-owen-dead-11126982/">the seeds of which were sown during last week’s episodes</a> — so there’ll no doubt be drama aplenty.</p>
      <p>However, with all of the aforementioned drama having <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/08/huge-spoiler-preview-for-autumn-christmas-and-beyond-in-eastenders-10673910/">kept us hooked for months on end</a> — and the Christmas period set to be explosive — you’d think that things would naturally begin to slow down a bit. Thankfully, this is far from the case, as — with the 35<sup>th </sup>anniversary on the horizon — it’s seemingly only going to get even better.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the upcoming milestone, Jake told us: ‘I think what Kate has done has really upped the game and really brought us to the top — and as far as I can see it’s going to continue, the scripts we’re getting are just amazing, I know what the plans are for the 35<sup>th</sup>— they’re going to be some of the most exciting scenes we’ve ever done. I’m really looking forward to it!’</p>

      <p>While we know very little about the anniversary — aside from the fact that Mick and Linda Carter (Danny Dyer and Kelle Bright) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/08/eastenders-spoilers-boss-kate-oates-reveals-christmas-and-35th-anniversary-plans-10618810/">will feature in a large capacity</a> — it’s safe to say it’s something that every EastEnders fan is looking forward to, and — if Jake’s comments are anything to go by — it sounds like it’s going to a truly unforgettable moment.</p>
      <p>Is it February yet?</p>
