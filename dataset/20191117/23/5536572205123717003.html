      <p>The Carolina Panthers were one of the hottest teams in the entire league after they lost QB Cam Newton to a foot injury, as they won four games in a row after his departure.</p>
      <p>Then they faced the 49ers and got smacked to reality and that has led to one win over their past four games.</p>
      <p>That also includes on Sunday where the team lost to the Atlanta Falcons 29-3 at home.</p>
      <p>QB Kyle Allen completes 31 of 50 passes for 325 yards and 4 interceptions.</p>
      <p>After the game, Panthers Pro Bowl safety Eric Reid campaigned for the team to sign Colin Kaepernick.</p>

      <p>“I THINK WE COULD USE COLIN’S HELP,” REID SAID. “I THINK EVERY TEAM IN THE LEAGUE COULD USE COLIN’S HELP. I WOULD DEFINITELY BE EXCITED IF HE WERE HERE</p>
      <p>Reid was among the first players to join Kaepernick in the national anthem protests back in 2016.</p>
