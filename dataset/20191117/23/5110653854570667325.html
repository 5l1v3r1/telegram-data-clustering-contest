      <p>Wickenheiserwent on to represent Canada again at the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, where she scoredseven goals and 10 points in five games to lead the team to its first gold medal.</p>
      <p>The following season she made history; after an Italian men's league <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/italians-bar-wickenheiser/article1027372/">denied her the opportunity to play</a> due to her gender, Wickenheiser insteadjoined HC Salamat,a third-division men'steam in Finland. With the club, she became the first woman to play professional hockey in a non-goaltending role (remember, Manon Rheaume?) on a men's team andregistered10 assists in 23 games. <a href="http://www.theicegarden.com/2019/7/1/18759962/origins-hayley-wickenheiser-2019-hockey-hall-of-fame-changed-the-game">According to </a><a href="https://www.theicegarden.com/2019/7/1/18759962/origins-hayley-wickenheiser-2019-hockey-hall-of-fame-changed-the-game">The Ice Garden</a>, Wickenheiserled the team in faceoff percentageand became the first woman torecord a point in a professional men's hockey game.</p>

      <p>Wickenheiser returnedtoNorth America for the 2004-05 season andjoinedtheWestern Women's Hockey League's Calgary Oval X-Treme. She impressed right away with a historic performance, posting 22 goals and 58 points in 18 games. In 51 career games with Calgary, she registered 68 goals and 155 points.</p>
      <p>It seemed as if nothing could slow Wickenheiserdown. She took home another Olympic gold medal in 2006 along with three more world championships with Canada andearnedthe team's captaincy in 2007. When the 2008-09 season rolled around, shewent back overseas to play men's third division in Sweden with HC Linden, and she won an Olympicgold medal at the Vancouver games in2010.</p>
      <p>For 2010-11, Wickenheiser joined the University of Calgary's women's team that competed in the Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) league. She chose to play there because of the Calgary Dinos' work ethic — they practiced every day — and becauseshe was working toward her kinesiology degree.During Wickenheiser'sfreshman year with the team, she racked up 17 goals and 40 points in 15games. She ended her college career in 2015with 134 points in 68 CIS games — and wonthree more world championships with Canada in that time period.</p>
      <p>At the 2014 Sochi Games, she not only ledCanada to goldagain, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/hayley-wickenheiser-had-broken-foot-at-sochi-olympics-1.2594371">but</a> <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/hayley-wickenheiser-had-broken-foot-at-sochi-olympics-1.2594371">she did so with a broken foot</a>,telling reporters after the fact that her left foot had been broken"for about a year" and that it didn't hurt to skate on.</p>
