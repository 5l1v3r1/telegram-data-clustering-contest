      <p>Nov. 17 (UPI) -- Virginia State Police said 19 people were hospitalized after a bus crashed into a tractor-trailer early Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>Heavy fog and icy conditions were responsible for <a href="https://twitter.com/VSPPIO/status/1196080615092871168">the crash</a> that occurred at 4:30 a.m. on the eastbound lanes of Interstate 64.</p>
      <p>The driver of the tractor-trailer lost control causing the vehicle to overturn and the bus carrying more than 20 people was unable to avoid a collision, Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corrine Geller <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/17/us/virginia-bus-and-truck-crash/index.html">told CNN</a>.</p>
      <p>"The impact of the crash split the tractor-trailer in half," said Geller. "The bus ran off the right side of the highway and came to rest against the guardrail.</p>
      <p>At least 19 people, including the drivers of the two vehicles, were injured. No deaths were reported and injuries sustained ranged from serious to minor.</p>
      <p>At least seven other crashes occurred in the same lanes after the crash, but police said no one was injured.</p>
