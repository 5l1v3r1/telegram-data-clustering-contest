      <p>The Faroe Islands will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.</p>
      <p>Faroese Foreign Minister Jenis av Rana told the Danish-language newspaper <i>Politiken </i>on Thursday that he plans to open a diplomatic office in Jerusalem after the funds are allocated.</p>
      <p>The Faroe Islands is a self-governing archipelago, that is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and is comprised of 18 volcanic islands between Iceland and Norway in the North Atlantic Ocean.</p>
      <p>Denmark has registered its objection to the move, and has no plans to move its own embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, according to the report.</p>
