      <h1>Nancy Pelosi says President Trump ‘so much worse’ than Richard Nixon</h1>

      <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday insisted President Trump was “so much worse” than Richard Nixon — suggesting he would quit the White House if he cared about the US.</p>
      <p>“It’s really a sad thing,” Pelosi <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-on-face-the-nation-november-17-2019/">said on CBS’ “Face the Nation,”</a> calling Trump an “imposter” who was “way over his head” as commander in chief.</p>
      <p>“I mean, what the president did was so much worse than even what Richard Nixon did, that at some point Richard Nixon cared about the country enough to recognize that this could not continue,” she said of the only US president to ever resign from office.</p>
      <p>“There’s so much wrongdoing attached with all of this,” she insisted of the probe into accusations of <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/white-house-releases-transcript-of-trumps-first-call-with-ukraines-volodymyr-zelensky/">bribing Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden</a>, his potential opponent in the 2020 election, to get withheld military aid.</p>
      <p>“None of us came here to impeach a president. This is very sad,” she said, also calling the allegations “very serious.”</p>
      <p>Pelosi made the comparison to Nixon, who resigned in 1974 over the Watergate scandal involving a break-in at Democratic Party headquarters and its cover-up, amid ongoing attacks Sunday from Republicans who claimed the impeachment hearings were “crumbling.”</p>
      <p>“When it comes to violating the Constitution of the United States, as he undermines our national security, jeopardizes the integrity of our elections, dishonors his own oath of office — that’s about impeachment,” Pelosi insisted defiantly.</p>
      <p>“This is about our democracy that is at risk with this president in the White House.”</p>
      <p>Pelosi also hit back at complaints that the hearings were unfairly one-sided, making it impossible for the president to get a fair hearing.</p>
      <p>“The president could come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants — if he wants to take the oath of office or he could do it in writing,” she said.</p>
      <p>“He has every opportunity to present his case.”</p>
      <p>Republicans’ however, appeared equally as confident that the impeachment hearings were already in trouble.</p>
      <p>“Just in this past week, we went from ‘this was all about a quid pro quo’ to ‘this was about extortion’ to ‘this is about bribery.’ So we don’t know what the ‘crimes’ will be,” <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/ratcliffe-ig-report-into-russia-probe-will-be-damning-for-doj/">Texas GOP Rep. John Ratcliffe said</a>.</p>
      <p>He also insisted there was “no victim” because Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said it was a “good call” with “no conditions, no demands, nothing improper,” Ratcliffe stressed.</p>
      <p>“So you’ve got no crime and you’ve got no victim. That’s the worst impeachment trial ever,” he said.</p>
      <p>He suggested that Republicans have “not one, but two hands tied behind our back” in the hearings — but insisting, “the Democrats are still losing.”</p>
      <p>“In a case where we talk about impeaching the president, it should be clear, it should be egregious and it should be bipartisan. And it’s none of those things,” he said.</p>
      <p>Pelosi had also ripped Trump for his <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/trump-slams-marie-yovanovitch-during-her-testimony-in-house-impeachment-inquiry/">tweet attacking former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch</a> while she gave evidence.</p>
      <p>“I think even his most ardent supporters have to honestly admit this is the wrong thing for the president to do,” she <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/impeachment-inquiry-latest-nancy-pelosi-face-the-nation-whistleblower-complaint-prompted-ukraine-aid-release/">told “Face the Nation.”</a></p>
      <p>“I think part of it is his own insecurity as an imposter. I think he knows full well that he’s in that office way over his head. And so he has to diminish everyone else,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I just think that was totally wrong and inappropriate — and typical of the president.”</p>
      <p>It was the one talking point some Republicans refused to fully defend the president over.</p>
      <p>“Along with most people, I find the president’s tweets generally unfortunate,” Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio), <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/11/17/mike-turner-impeachment-hearing-witness-intimidation-tapper-sot-sotu-vpx.cnn">told CNN’s “State of the Union.”</a></p>
      <p>However, he stressed, “It’s certainly not impeachable and it’s certainly not criminal and it’s certainly not witness intimidation.”</p>
      <p>When CNN’s Jake Tapper questioned whether Yovanovitch was surely intimidated by being targeted by “the most powerful person in the universe any further,” Turner smiled as he replied, “I think you overstate Donald Trump’s powers. Hopefully.”</p>
