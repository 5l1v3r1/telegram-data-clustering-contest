      <h1>Browns Reportedly Shut Down An Exclusive Myles Garrett Interview After Season-Long Suspension</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:05:14+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:05</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>In the wake of the indefinite suspension handed down to Cleveland Browns DE Myles Garrett for his helmet swing at Pittsburgh Steelers QB Mason Rudolph that connected with his head, he has pretty much been silent aside from releasing a statement to the media after being suspended.</p>
      <p>FOX Sports NFL insider Jay Glazer revealed on Sunday that he got Garrett to agree to a sit-down interview with him to address everything that happened during that massive brawl that ended his 2019 campaign.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for him and us, we won’t get to hear it.</p>
      <p>Glazer took to Twitter to explain shortly before he and his team were headed to the airport to fly outand meet Garrett, the Browns informed him that he could not do the interview.</p>

      <p>Aside from the Browns DE missing the rest of the year — Browns DT Larry Ogunjobi earned a suspension of his own after he was viewed pushing Mason Rudolph from behind with his helmet off.</p>
      <p>Cleveland will face the Miami Dolphins next week as they look to continue on their 2-game winning streak and keep their playoff hopes alive.</p>
