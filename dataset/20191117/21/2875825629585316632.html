      <p>Ant McPartlin joked about his "year off" as he was reunited with Declan Donnelly on I'm A Celebrity tonight.</p>
      <p>The double act was back and stronger than ever this evening as a whole new host of scared celebrities ventured into the jungle.</p>
      <p>However the pair couldn't resist a joke at Ant's drink-drive shame last year.</p>
      <p>Introducing the programme tonight, Dec announced: "We're back, he's back, we're all back, back back!"</p>
      <p>After a series of hilarious gags at Prince Andrew's expense, they said it was down to the public to decide who wins and is crowned queen or king of the jungle.</p>

      <p>Ant said: “I'm A Celebrity 2019 can only have one winner.”</p>
      <p>Dec said: “Caitlyn Jenner's agent by the sound of it.”</p>
      <p>Ant added: “OK so two winners. Time to meet our first celeb, someone who always does the right thing, is a right laugh and is made of the right stuff. It's...”</p>
      <p>Dec interupted by joking: “It's Kate Garraway.”</p>
      <p>Ant said: “It's Ian Wright. I have had a year off, what is your excuse?"</p>

      <p>Ant was forced to pull out of the series in 2018 and was replaced by Holly Willoughby following his drink-drive shame earlier that year.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old decided to take a break from his TV presenting duties to focus on his recovery.</p>
      <p>In a statement, he said: "My recovery is going very well and for that to continue having spoken to Dec and ITV, I have made the decision to take the rest of the year off."</p>

      <p>Ant returned to his presenting duties in January 2019, just after Holly filled in for him in Australia.</p>
      <p>This year's I'm A Celebrity line-up includes the likes of reality TV <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> , footballer <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ian-wright">Ian Wright</a> , Girls Aloud star <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/nadine-coyle">Nadine Coyle</a> , and former EastEnders star <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/jacqueline-jossa">Jacqueline Jossa</a> .</p>
      <p>However former host Holly won't be tuning in for this evening's episode.</p>

      <p>Instead, she will be skipping a night in front of the TV with the rest of the nation to attend the premiere of Frozen 2 in London on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Holly, 38, is more than just a fan of the ITV reality show as she was brought in to replace Ant McPartlin when he took a year out of I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>A self-confessed Disney fan, Holly made sure she didn't miss out on being one of the first to see the highly anticipated sequel.</p>
