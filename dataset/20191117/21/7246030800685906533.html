      <p>The airline, which operates two daily flights between the Ethiopian capital to Israel’s top financial hub, had intended to unveil the name of its new 787-9 aircraft upon arrival at Ben-Gurion International Airport in an official ceremony.</p>
      <p>But photos managed to make it to the media ahead of the event, according to a report by <i>Ynet</i>, after the aircraft had left the Boeing factory in Charleston, South Carolina last Tuesday for its experimental flight to Israel.</p>
      <p>Numerous airlines have recently added direct routes to Tel Aviv to their flight rosters, as competition has begun to grow with rising tourism to the Jewish State.</p>
