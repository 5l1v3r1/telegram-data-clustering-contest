      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Stefanos+Tsitsipas">Stefanos Tsitsipas</a> came of age at London’s 02 Arena with a stunning victory over <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Dominic+Thiem">Dominic Thiem</a> to win the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_event=ATP+Finals">ATP Finals</a>.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old from Athens became the youngest winner of the prestigious season-ending tournament since Lleyton Hewitt in 2001, and the youngest debutant to lift the trophy since John McEnroe back in 1978.</p>
      <p>Just a year after winning the NextGen Finals, for players of 21 and under, Tsitsipas mixed it with the very best on the bank of the Thames and came out on top.</p>
      <p>Congratulated by his country’s prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis after his semi-final win over <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Roger+Federer">Roger Federer</a>, Tsitsipas went on to write his name in Greek sporting mythology with a 6-7 (6), 6-2, 7-6 (4) victory.</p>
      <p>It was only the third time in 16 years that the final did not feature at least one of the ‘big three’, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Rafael+Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a>, Novak Djokovic or Federer, and further evidence surely that the long-awaited power shift in men’s tennis is finally on the way.</p>
      <p>At 26 Thiem is just about part of that youthful scene as well, and his notable wins over Federer and Djokovic this week helped him climb to fourth in the world rankings.</p>
      <p>But the final belonged to Tsitsipas and the legions of Greek fans who made the 02 feel like a home from home for the new champion.</p>
      <p>The two are close friends on the Tour – Tsitsipas even acted as Thiem’s hitting partner at the tournament in 2016 – and they embraced at the net after a gruelling encounter.</p>
      <h3>‘Unbelievable’</h3>
      <p>Tsitsipas said: “I was playing with nerves, it’s such a big event. I was a break up in the third set, but couldn’t hold it, but I’m so relieved with this outstanding performance I gave on the court.</p>
      <p>“It’s phenomenal, unbelievable to have such an army behind me, they give me energy, and belief, and I just love that. I would like to thank everyone who supported me with a Greek flags and made me feel at home.”</p>
      <p>Tsisipas was the aggressor from the start, dropping just three points in his opening three service games while forcing the first break point, from which Thiem escaped with a swish of his forehand.</p>
      <p>There were further chances to break for both players, Tsitsipas serving and volleying his way out of trouble and Thiem finding his first serve when he needed it.</p>
      <p>A tie-break was required to separate them, and when the score reached 7-6 each player had won 44 points. But crucially, Thiem had the ball in his hand and an unreturnable first serve clinched the opening set.</p>
      <p>Yet if that was tight, the second was a walkover as Tsitsipas broke twice, raced into a 4-0 lead and confidently served it out. The first set had taken over an hour, the second lasted 26 minutes in a blur of shaggy hair and flamboyant shot-making, and all Thiem’s good work had unravelled.</p>
      <h3>Early break</h3>
      <p>When Thiem netted a backhand Tsitsipas had an early break in the decider, but the Greek began bearing gifts and three wayward backhands allowed Thiem to draw level.</p>
      <p>The powerful one-handed backhands were out in force from both players in the tie-break, but it was a horrible, wafted forehand from Thiem which handed Tsitsipas the initiative, and a memorable victory was wrapped up in two hours and 34 minutes.</p>
