      <h2>Liverpool have opened up a nine-point lead over defending champions City after just 12 matches following their win in the clash between the two sides at Anfield</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:48:18+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:48</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/lee-dixon">Lee Dixon</a> believes the main reason Liverpool are so far ahead of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Man City</a> is the absence of Aymeric Laporte.</p>
      <p>The City defender has been out of action since the end of August after suffering a serious knee injury in his side's win over <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/aymeric-laporte">Laporte</a> underwent surgery at the time which has ruled him out until early next year.</p>
      <p>His injury has left City short of centre halves, after manager Pep Guardiola opted not to replace Vincent Kompany in the summer, with midfielder Fernandinho since forced to deputise at the back as a result.</p>
      <p>And Dixon feels that has given rivals <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> the edge in the race for the title.</p>

      <p>"I’m trying to put it down to one thing, I would probably say Laporte getting injured for me is the biggest factor," Dixon told The Season So Far.</p>
      <p>"I think he is a brilliant defender, I think he holds down that left-hand side of the defence, whoever is playing at left-back he can kind of control that side of the pitch and obviously his centre-half on the inside. So that’s a big area of pitch to replace somebody.</p>
      <p>"You can put a body in there and I think that’s been a problem at centre-back as is well-documented, with Fernandinho going in there who’s a brilliant footballer but he’s not got that sixth sense of somebody just nicking in-behind him off his shoulder.</p>

      <p>"The amount of times you go ‘they’re in position’ but somehow someone gets in, the little ones around the corner are difficult to deal with, especially around the box."</p>
      <p>City have already conceded 13 goals so far in the Premier League this season, having shipped just 23 in the whole of the last campaign.</p>
      <p>Their defensive frailties have been laid bare in shock defeats to Norwich and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> , before a makeshift back four were beaten at Anfield.</p>
      <p>They return to Premier League action after the international break with a difficult test, as they welcome high flying <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> to the Etihad, who sit one place ahead of them in the table, while Liverpool travel to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> .</p>
