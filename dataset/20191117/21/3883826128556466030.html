        <b>The brother of missing woman Leah Croucher has died, their father has said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ms Croucher, 20, was last seen in Milton Keynes on 15 February.</p>
      <p>In a Facebook post, her father John said he had spoken to his son Haydon on Thursday to reassure him, almost nine months after Leah's disappearance.</p>
      <p>He said the 24-year-old died hours later, after police arrived at his house to tell him his son was "fighting for life."</p>
      <p>Ms Croucher was last seen by her parents at their home in Quantock Crescent on the evening of 14 February.</p>
      <p>She told her family she was meeting a friend but police said the meeting did not happen.</p>
      <p>CCTV showed her walking about half a mile from her home at about 08:15 the next day.</p>

      <p>Haydon had appeared in court earlier this year accused of making threats to a man he described as Leah's ex-boyfriend.</p>
      <p>He accepted a voluntary restraining order and the prosecution was dropped.</p>
      <p>Mr Croucher said he had arranged to meet up with his son on Friday so they could spend the day that marked nine months since Leah's disappearance together.</p>
      <p>He said his son was a "kind, generous, funny, witty and loving person".</p>
      <p>He added: "Be at peace Haydon. If Leah is up there with you look after each other as always, until we get there.</p>
      <p>"We love and miss you both terribly. Our world could not be more broken than it is now."</p>
