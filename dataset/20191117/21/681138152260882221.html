      <p>Pope, who was released by Town at 16 before studying at West Suffolk College and playing for Bury Town, made his first start as the Three Lions ran out 4-0 winners with goals from Harry Winks, Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford and Mason Mount.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old Burnley stopper, who made his international debut as a substitute against Costa Rica last June, made a good early save to deny Kosovo's Atdhe Nuhiu in Pristina.</p>
      <p>After being selected for last summer's World Cup squad, Pope will be hoping to make the number one spot his own before next summer's European Championships.</p>

      <p>England boss Southgate, whose side were already assured of top spot in Group A, said: "I think it was a tight game. It was a good test for us really. "Difficult pitch, in particular, lots of people slipping and a few passes went astray.</p>
      <p>"But we needed a tighter game. It was the sort of challenge I was pleased we got.</p>
      <p>"We had to withstand spells of pressure, gave them a few half-chances that on another night could be more of a problem, but in the end our counter-attacking was absolutely ruthless."</p>
