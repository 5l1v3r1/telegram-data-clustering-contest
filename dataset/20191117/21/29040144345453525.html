      <p>The recent Star Wars resurgence thanks to Disney's acquisition of the franchise and the new sequel trilogy of movies has caused an explosion in the number of Star Wars fans around the galaxy. Many of these newer fans didn't grow up on the original Star Wars, but this generation of younglings can still experience them in other ways. When a dated movie just doesn't cut it, video games can step in to help. LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is aiming to do just that.</p>
      <p>And let's be honest. Adults love the LEGO video game series too.</p>
      <h4>All nine films</h4>

      <p>A galaxy far, far away</p>
      <p>LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga will be the first game to compile all nine of the series' main entries into one package. We'll just need to wait until after The Rise of Skywalker releases to find out how it all ends.</p>

      <h3>What is LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga?</h3>

      <p>LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is an upcoming video game that adapts the main nine Star Wars films that comprise the Skywalker Saga: The original trilogy, the prequel trilogy, and the (as of yet incomplete) sequel trilogy.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Phantom Menace (1999)</li>
        <li>Attack of the Clones (2002)</li>
        <li>Revenge of the Sith (2005)</li>
        <li>A New Hope (1977)</li>
        <li>The Empire Strikes Back (1980)</li>
        <li>Return of the Jedi (1983)</li>
        <li>The Force Awakens (2015)</li>
        <li>The Last Jedi (2017)</li>
        <li>The Rise of Skywalker (2019)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to publisher Warner Bros. Interactive, all nine films will be compiled into one brand-new video game package, not unlike LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga, which bundled up levels based on the original and prequel trilogies.</p>
      <p>So far, we know that there will be a total of 45 levels, with each episode receiving five story missions each. Previous versions of this game included a main hub where characters jumped off to experience separate missions. This game will be set up similarly, but will have a specific hub for each episode rather than simply sharing one hub for all the episodes.</p>
      <p>If you're wondering whether or not you'll be able to play as your favorite Star Wars characters that appear in the main Skywalker story, the chances are pretty high. There are going to be over 200 playable characters to choose from. I know I'm excited to run around as Boba Fett, Darth Maul, and Han Solo among others.</p>
      <h3>Who is making it?</h3>
      <p>LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is being developed by Traveller's Tales within the company's new engine known at NTT and will be published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment rather than a Disney publisher.</p>
      <h3>Will it adapt other Star Wars movies?</h3>
      <p>It doesn't look like it will adapt any other Star Wars movies other than the main nine episodes. The anthology films Rogue One and Solo will be left out as they don't directly tie into the Skywalker family's journey.</p>
      <h3>What can I expect from its gameplay?</h3>

      <p>Though its announcement trailer didn't show any actual gameplay, you can likely expect it to play similarly to previous LEGO Star Wars games. You'll play through levels based on certain parts of each movie and complete them by exploring, solving puzzles, and building LEGO tools to progress. And because it's a Star Wars game, you'll surely be able to participate in lightsaber duels and use your Force powers.</p>
      <p>The developer did not reveal what, if any, new gameplay mechanics would be making their way to LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, but the studio did say that fans will have "complete freedom to explore the LEGO Star Wars galaxy." And best of all, The Skywalker Saga will feature hundreds of playable characters with a massive amount of content.</p>
      <h3>Will it remake the previous LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga?</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga, which originally came out over ten years ago, isn't just being thrown into The Skywalker Saga and ported over. The Skywalker Saga is a completely new game, and for the first time fans can hop in at any point in the franchise timeline, whether they want to start with The Phantom Menace or skip all the way until The Last Jedi before they get a taste of the final movie.</p>
      <p>The Force Awakens was adapted into a LEGO game a few years ago, but it's also being completely remade from the ground up for The Skywalker Saga. The Last Jedi film never received a LEGO video game counterpart, so this will be the first time it is adapted in this way.</p>
      <h3>Is there anything else we should expect?</h3>
      <p>Disney is doing what Disney knows best, animation. It seems we will be seeing a LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga animated series. While very little is known about this additional project for the LEGO Star Wars title, so far, many believe it will be tied in with the release of the game some time late 2020. Thus far, it is expected the animation will be handled by WilFilm, the studio behind <i>The Freemaker Adventures</i> and <i>Droid Tales.</i></p>
      <h3>When does it release?</h3>

      <p>Because Star Wars Episode 9: The Rise of Skywalker doesn't come out until December, you'll be waiting until sometime in 2020 for LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. They can't exactly spoil the movie in a game before the film even comes out.</p>
      <p>LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga will be available for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC. You can pre-order it today.</p>
