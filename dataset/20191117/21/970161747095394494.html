      <p>So just why did Ant miss the 2018 series?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>Why didn’t Ant do I’m A Celebrity last year?</h3>
      <p>Ant pulled out of hosting I’m A Celebrity 2018 <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/22/what-tv-shows-did-ant-mcpartlin-work-on-in-2018-to-qualify-for-a-national-television-award-8375290/">after he stepped away from his TV</a> commitments <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/04/16/ant-mcpartlin-fined-86000-drink-driving-judge-says-lost-good-character-7471919/">following a drink driving conviction</a> and battles with alcohol and prescription drugs.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old took the time out to focus on his health, pulling out of Britain’s Got Talent <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/03/ant-mcpartlin-returning-to-saturday-night-takeaway-alongside-dec-donnelly-after-two-years-away-10514468/">and Saturday Night Takeaway,</a> with Dec forced to go it alone in the BGT 2018 live shows, as well as host some instalments of Saturday Night Takeaway alone.</p>
