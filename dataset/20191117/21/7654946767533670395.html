      <h1>Sam Darnold’s career day leads Jets in easy win over Redskins</h1>

      <p>LANDOVER, Md. — Not all losing teams are created equally.</p>
      <p>Not all young quarterbacks are created equally.</p>
      <p>The Jets and Redskins entered the eyesore on Sunday’s NFL slate with records worthy of top-five NFL draft picks, but the game showed the difference between the teams is bigger than anyone could have suspected.</p>
      <p>Sam Darnold threw three of his career-best four touchdown passes in the first half and safety Jamal Adams had three sacks to wreck a second straight game as the Jets built a 31-point lead and finished off a 34-17 win at FedEx Field.</p>
      <p>Darnold led the Jets on an opening touchdown drive for the fourth straight game, scrambling out of the pocket and finding backup tight end Daniel Brown in a crease behind Josh Norman and Landon Collins.</p>
      <p>Jets CEO Christopher Johnson’s vote of confidence for Adam Gase ended all speculation about the coach’s future, and now the team might play its way to a strong finish. After next week’s visit from the Raiders, the Jets face back-to-back teams that entered this week with two combined wins (Bengals and Dolphins).</p>
      <p>Robby Anderson, Ryan Griffin and ex-Redskin Jamison Crowder also caught touchdown passes from Darnold, who finished 19 of 30 for 293 yards.</p>
      <p>Anderson celebrated his score by jumping into the stands to celebrate with a traveling Jets fan in a Le’Veon Bell jersey and helmet. In his 46th career game, Griffin, who has become a favorite of Darnold’s with Chris Herndon’s near-season-long absence, topped 100 yards for the first time.</p>
      <p>Bell scored a late touchdown as the Jets won back-to-back games for the first time since October 2018.</p>

      <p>The Jets (3-7) led 13-0 when they momentarily tried to out-miscue the Redskins.</p>
      <p>With pressure bearing down, Darnold retreated and threw off his back foot with a double clutch, directly into the intercepting arms of Jon Bostic. It was one of those “impulse decisions” the Jets are trying to coach out of Darnold in his second season without losing his ability to make something out of nothing.</p>
      <p>Before the Jets could run another offensive play, Vyncint Smith fumbled a kickoff return.</p>
      <p>So, what did the Redskins (2-8) do with two takeaways and back-to-back drive starts at the Jets’ 16-yard line and 27-yard line? They gained 6 total yards on 10 plays and settled for three points, with a second field goal attempt clanging off the upright to the dismay of the “Sell the team!” chanting crowd.</p>
      <p>At that point, the Jets held a 153-9 edge in total yards.</p>
      <p>Making his second career start and fourth appearance, rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins looks like he has a much bigger learning curve than fellow first-rounders Kyler Murray (Cardinals) and Daniel Jones (Giants). He fumbled twice and was intercepted by Neville Hewitt during a 19 of 35 performance for 214 yards and two garbage-time touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Jets defensive coordinator Gregg Williams confused Haskins. Pressure was coming from unexpected places and would-be pre-snap blitzers dropped off the line into coverage.</p>
      <p>Haskins’ only real big play before the score got out of hand — he showed off his tantalizing cannon on a 67-yard strike to former Ohio State teammate Terry McLaurin — was called back. The two penalties enforced on the play cost the Redskins 82 yards of field position.</p>
