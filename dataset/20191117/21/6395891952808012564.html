      <p><b>CENTRAL FALLS, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - The American Red Cross says it's helping families in Rhode Island and in Connecticut who were displaced from their homes after recent fires.</p>
      <p>The charity announced Sunday that it's aiding four families who were living in a building that caught fire in Central Falls, Rhode Island, on Saturday night. Firefighters from four communities battled the blaze, which caused heavy damage.</p>
      <p>The four families include nine adults and six children who were given help with immediate needs. They also will be connected with case workers to develop recovery plans.</p>
      <p>The organization says it's separately helping a family of three adults in New Haven, Connecticut, who were displaced after a fire damaged their home Saturday.</p>
      <p>No injuries were reported in either fire. Authorities in both states say they are investigating the fires.</p>
