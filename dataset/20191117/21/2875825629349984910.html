      <p>Fans of Nadine Coyle have begged I'm A Celebrity producers to bring in subtitles to help understand her strong accent.</p>
      <p>The Northern Irish former Girls Aloud babe is one of the new campmates heading into the Jungle but it seems fans aren't digging her accent so far.</p>
      <p>Flocking to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , fans were joking about her accent.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "Subtitles for Nadine please <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> ".</p>
      <p>A second added: "Sorry but I’m going to need a translator to understand Nadine <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> ".</p>
      <p>A third harshly commented: "Gonna have to watch <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> with the subtitles on, not because I can't understand Nadine's accent, but because I can't stand it."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Forgot about Nadine's weird Irish/LA accent <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> ".</p>

      <p>Nadine recently laid bare her anxiety struggles after her Girls Aloud days ahead of her Jungle debut.</p>
      <p>Once fearless on stage singing in one of the most popular girl bands at the time, the mother confessed she has since been hampered with her nerves.</p>
      <p>However, the singer has insisted she is determined to overcome her fears by tackling the I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here reality TV jaunt in the jungle.</p>

      <p>She said: “I really want to try something completely new. I am scared of so many things. I used to be brave. In the past, I’ve opened a restaurant, had a record label, had my daughter and it was go, go, go with all of these.</p>

      <p>"Now I have got so fearful even being in the car, flying or general things. I think it is since I became a parent that I am much more afraid.</p>
      <p>“I really hope that by doing this, it pushes me so far out the comfort zone and that I learn to be comfortable, feel relaxed and do the things that I didn’t used to be afraid of.”</p>
