      <h1>Ford Mustang Mach-E Shelb-E Renderings Predict The Inevitable</h1>
      <h2>Shelby all the things!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:31:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/christopher-smith/" target="_blank">Christopher Smith</a></address>
      <p>Is this <i>really</i> inevitable? Possibly, but before the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/shelby/">Shelby</a> fans of the world send us hate mail over these GT500-esque renderings of the new <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/mach-e/">Mustang Mach-E</a>, let us revisit some Shelby history. Yes, the iconic stripes and branding are synonymous with the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/mustang/">Mustang</a>, but these days you can also get a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/380400/shelby-super-snake-sport-f150/">Shelby F-150</a> pickup and once upon a time, Shelby badges adorned turbocharged front-wheel-drive <a href="https://www.motor1.com/dodge/">Dodge</a> hatchbacks in the 1980s. In the grand scheme of things, then, a Shelby-branded electric crossover might not be so bad.</p>

      <p>Actually, we’re rather impressed with the way these renderings came out. It’s not like the Mach-E is completely unrelated to the Mustang, so dialing in some <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/shelby-gt500/">GT500</a> flavor is easy peasy. The squared-off front clip is a good look for this EV crossover, and yes, we’re well aware that a power bulge hood on an electric car makes as much sense as a vegan crocodile. It still looks cool though, and in this instance, the extra space can offer a bit more frunk storage as opposed to clearance for a non-existant supercharger.</p>

      <p>As for performance, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/">Ford</a> already has a GT model of the Mach-E planned for 2021 that will rival the current Shelby GT500, at least in a sprint to 60 mph. The 760-horsepower muscle car gets there in 3.3 seconds, while the Mach-E GT is shooting for a time in the mid-3-second range. Juicing the battery for a proposed Ford Shelb-E model could see this crossover cut a full second off that time. Would you feel better about a Shelby-branded electric SUV that could hit 60 mph in 2.5 seconds and rip a 10-second quarter-mile?</p>
      <p>Admittedly, this Shelb-E creation is just a flight-of-fancy on our part but it could well preview the future of performance. Electric power is here to stay, and there’s no denying the performance potential of instant thrust with <i>right now</i> torque that electricity can offer. So why not add some stripes and a Shelby badge and just have some fun?</p>
      <p>After all, it worked for the Dodge Omni.</p>
