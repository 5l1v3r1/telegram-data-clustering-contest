      <h1>ITV The Chase fans say I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! star got 'easy' questions</h1>
      <h2>'Celebrity Chase, so out comes the easy box of questions'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:01:54+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/rebecca-koncienzcy/" target="_blank">Rebecca Koncienzcy</a></address>
      <p>The Chase fans took to Twitter and said <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> star Malique Thompson-Dwyer was given 'easy' questions.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/hollyoaks">Hollyoaks</a> actor went head-to-head against his old jungle campmate Anne Hegerty after banking £2,000 in the cash builder.</p>
      <p>He was apprehensive about it and said: "Anne is so smart, it was like having Wikipedia in the jungle. It is like I am going up against Wikipedia."</p>
      <p>But The Governess told him to have more faith, she said: "You got a thousand pound more than you thought you would [in the cash builder] and two thousand more than I thought you would get."</p>
      <p>He went for the middle offer of £2,000 and muddled his way through the questions.</p>

      <p>The audience were in hysterics when Malique said the answer to "In the first line of the children's son, Little Boy Blue is instructed to do what with his horn?"</p>
      <p>The actor thought it was C. Polish it, instead of B. Blow it.</p>
      <p>Even Bradley struggled to keep his composure as he laughed out loud.</p>
      <p>Despite his incorrect answers, Malique managed to guess his way through to the final chase, thanks to a few uncharacteristic mistakes from Anne, with his £2,000 added to the charity fund.</p>
      <p>But the 'easy' questions didn't go unnoticed by viewers, one, @TheJokerMan2019 said: "How easy are these questions..... fixed for him."</p>
      <p>Another, @jamesk74497814 said: "Easy questions for this lad."</p>
      <p>A third, @mattsauly said: "Celebrity chase, so out comes the easy box of questions."</p>
      <p>A fourth, @hunterjames512 said: "Rigged, these questions are catered to their intelligence. Don’t get this on the regular show."</p>
      <p>And a fifth @81Lmc added: "Wish questions were this easy on normal."</p>
      <p>The special celebrity editions of The Chase are played for charities, but unfortunately, Malique and former EastEnders actress Rita Simmons were unable to defeat the chaser after Fleur East and James McVey were caught by Anne.</p>
