      <h1>Report: Former Raptors Valanciunas, Wright, Miles not getting rings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:02:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/author/sportsnet-staff/" target="_blank">Sportsnet Staff</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/teams/toronto-raptors/">Toronto Raptors</a> will reportedly not be giving Jonas Valunciunas, <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/players/delon-wright/744102">Delon Wright</a> and CJ Miles rings commemorating Toronto’s NBA Championship victory, <a href="https://torontosun.com/sports/basketball/nba/toronto-raptors/raptors-wont-give-valanciunas-wright-and-cj-miles-championship-rings?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574026973">according to Mike Ganter of <i>the Toronto Sun</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Following Toronto’s loss on Saturday to the Dallas Mavericks, team general manager Bobby Webster confirmed to Ganter that none of the three former Raptors would be receiving championship rings.</p>
      <p>“Its not an easy decision,” Webster told the Sun. “But, to be honest I think it’s standard. I mean we did our homework, we talked to teams and I think – I don’t remember – there was maybe one scenario where a team offered one. I think it was Anderson Varejao in Golden State but I think it was a really unique circumstance. It’s obviously not a feel-good thing but I think that’s the way the league is.”</p>
      <p>According to the report, both management and players were involved in the decision-making process regarding who would receive a ring and who would not.</p>
      <p>“At the end of the day it’s who was on the court June 13th. That’s kind of how we decided it,” Webster said.</p>
      <p>Valanciunas, Wright and Miles were with the Raptors to start last year’s eventual championship winning season but were traded to the Memphis Grizzlies at the trade deadline as part of the deal that brought Marc Gasol to Toronto.</p>
      <p>News that Valanciunas — who spent seven seasons with the Raptors, averaging 11.8 points and 8.4 rebounds per game — would not receive a ring runs contrary to reports made earlier in the year that Kyle Lowry <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/lowry-texted-valanciunas-receiving-raptors-championship-ring/">texted him asking about his ring size</a>, suggesting that Valanciunas may be receiving one.</p>
      <p>Wright spent four seasons with the Raptors, appearing in 172 games with averages of 6.7 points and 2.3 assists per game.</p>
      <p>Miles signed with Toronto in 2017 and spent parts of two seasons with the Raptors. He appeared in 110 games, averaging 8.3 points per game.</p>
