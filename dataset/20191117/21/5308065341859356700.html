      <p>Hollywood actor Robert Downey Jr. is good at doing many things at a time.</p>
      <p>The actor did an awesome job playing Tony Stark aka Iron Man in the record-breaking film, Avengers:Endgame.</p>
      <p>The directors of the film, the Russo brothers called it an “awards-caliber performance.”</p>
      <p>To get the actor nominated for an Academy Award, Marvel fans signed a petition but the 54-year-old actor said during an interview with Howard Stern that he doesn’t want his own Oscar campaign.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, Disney went ahead and submitted his name and those of other Avengers:Endgame cast members for Oscar consideration.</p>
      <p>Joe Russo said that Robert Downey Jr. “will never say the same line twice” and this talented actor delivered his lines while eating snacks in his scenes.</p>
      <p>As a veteran actor, Downey Jr. is no stranger to how hectic movie sets get with the long hours. It is hard to take a break and grab a bite in between scenes.</p>
      <p>So this brilliant actor took it upon himself to shoot scenes with the addition of snacks.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484509/12-crazy-behind-the-scenes-facts-from-avengers-endgame">Cinema Blend ,</a>Downey Jr. would bring out snacks without forewarning meaning many of his scenes with snacks were improvised.</p>
      <p>Tony Stark also had food which he offered to everyone at one point in Avengers:Endgame.</p>
      <p>The snacking isn’t written in the script but Downey Jr. improvised the line because at that time during filming, he felt hungry and needed to eat something.</p>
      <p>To become Iron Man, Downey Jr. ate 5,000 calories a day.</p>
      <p>Before he suited up to be Iron Man, he trained for months to get in shape with trainer, Brad Bose.</p>

      <p>To make the most of the gym workouts, Downey Jr. had to eat 5,000 calories a day.</p>
      <p>According to the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the recommended calorie intake for men is 2,000 to 3,000 calories a day.</p>
      <p>Downey Jr. gained 25 pounds of muscle at the end of the training with Bose. The habit of snacking during the scenes are a way to maintain his superhero physique.</p>
