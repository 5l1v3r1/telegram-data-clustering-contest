      <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo shuts down rumours of row with Sarri and Juventus</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:59:04+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:59</time> by <a rel="author">Jaikuran Randhawa</a></address>
      <p>According to <a href="https://forzaitalianfootball.com/2019/11/cristiano-ronaldo-i-dont-like-to-be-substituted-but-i-wasnt-fully-fit/">Forza Italian Football</a>, Juventus superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has shut down rumours of a reported rift with the club and manager Maurizio Sarri.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old admitted that he “doesn’t like” being substituted but also shed light that on the fact that injuries have been impacting his performances recently.</p>
      <p>The former Manchester United and Real Madrid talisman was brought off in the 55th minute of the ‘Old Lady’s’ clash to be replaced by eventual game winner Paulo Dybala.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo seemed very animated after the substitution with <a href="https://www.tuttosport.com/news/calcio/serie-a/juventus/2019/11/12-63314783/ronaldo_non_insulta_sarri_la_giusta_interpretazione_del_labiale/?a=2">Tuttosport</a> reporting he said the words ‘Porra Caralho’ to Sarri on the weekend after being taken off, words that loosely translate to ‘what the f***!’ in English.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the media have exaggerated the situation between the forward and Juventus. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/cristiano-ronaldo-hold-showdown-talks-20888355">The Mirror</a> recently reported that the superstar would hold showdown talks with Juventus chiefs when he returns from international break.</p>

        <b>Here’s what the five-time Ballon d’Or winner had to say on the controversy surrounding him:</b>
      </p>
      <p>“In the last three weeks, I have been playing despite not being fully fit,”</p>
      <p>“I don’t like to be substituted, but I have been playing despite not being fully fit and I tried to help Juventus. I understand the substitutions, as I wasn’t 100 percent.”</p>
      <p>“In these two games with Portugal I wasn’t at 100 percent either.”</p>
      <p>“But I am very proud to sacrifice myself for the national team or for my club.”</p>
      <p>“In my career, I never had serious injuries, as I usually do between 50 and 60 games, but I am having some discomfort that prevent me from being at 100 percent.”</p>
      <p>“Someone should have said something, especially the coach or myself, but you know I don’t usually talk to the press a lot.”</p>
      <p>Ronaldo has only scored 6 goals in 14 appearances across all competitions so far this season for Juventus. The Portuguese star will be hoping to silence his critics when he’s back from the international break.</p>
      <p>Juventus face Atletico Madrid later this month and this would be the perfect moment for Ronaldo to show that he’s not slowing down anytime soon.</p>
