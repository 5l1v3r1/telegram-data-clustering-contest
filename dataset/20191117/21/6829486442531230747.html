      <h1>Tom Tilley Is Leaving Triple J’s ‘Hack’ After Almost A Decade</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:47:25+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:47</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Tom Tilley, who has been the host of the flagship triple j program <i>Hack</i> for almost a decade, is moving on from the station.</p>
      <p>It’s been eight years since Tilley first took the reins as the host of <i>Hack,</i> a news and current affairs program centred around frequently hard-hitting and incisive interviews.</p>
      <p>During that time, Tilley has garnered a reputation as a skilled interviewer, able to get admissions out of his subjects that they might have not otherwise offered themselves — consider <a href="https://junkee.com/sticky-fingers-interview-hack/154216">Dylan Frost of Sticky Fingers letting slip a “boys will be boys”</a> when confronted with the allegations of bad behaviour against him.</p>
      <p>Tilley’s time has not been without controversy, however, and <a href="https://junkee.com/triple-j-white-nationalist/118108"><i>Hack</i> was slammed for giving airtime to an alleged “white nationalist”.</a></p>
      <p>Now, Tilley is moving on to “new” and “exciting” opportunities. It’s not yet clear what those are — but it’s worth noting that Tilley has strayed into the world of television recently, occasionally appearing as a guest on <i>The Project</i>.</p>

      <p>Could a shift to TV be in the works? Nothing’s clear yet — Tilley’s statement is all about honouring the past and being positive about the future, not laying out specific plans.</p>
      <p>“Hack has taken me further than my wildest dreams, from a naive triple j listener in the paddocks of Mudgee to interviewing the country’s most powerful people,” Tilley said in the statement.</p>
      <p>“While grilling ministers live on radio was a lot of fun and often necessary, my proudest moments are our conversations about mental health.</p>
      <p>“Now, after 12 years at triple j and eight years hosting <i>Hack</i>, it’s time to let another passionate young journo take the reins and for me to explore exciting new opportunities.”</p>
