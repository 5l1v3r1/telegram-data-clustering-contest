      <h1>Logan Paul confirms appeal to KSI loss has been filed</h1>
      <h2>The YouTuber is furious with the result of the highly-anticipated bout after he lost by split decision earlier this month in Los Angeles</h2>

      <p>Logan Paul and his team have confirmed that they will file an official complaint following the the 24-year-old's defeat to YouTube rival KSI earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Brit KSI- real name Olajide Williams Olatunji- beat Paul by split decision on November 9 with a final score of 56-55, 57-54 55-56 in the six-rounds fight.</p>
      <p>Logan, however, had two points deducted in round four for hitting KSI while he was down, meaning without the penalizations he could have won.</p>
      <p>Speaking on his YouTube channel, Paul said: "My team and I have decided to file an official appeal for the fight, because we just don't believe the outcome was right.</p>

      <p>"I truthfully 100 per cent believe I did not lose this fight. My stomach just started turning over the fact I didn't believe the outcome was correct on this, and if I just stood by and didn't do anything about it, or at least try, then I'd be way disappointed with myself.</p>
      <p>"This is a plea to the California State Athletic Commission, I would just hope that you give this the weight that it deserves.</p>
      <p>"Because I fear that we aren't <i>real p</i> rofessional fighters, it may be overlooked, but I know this means a lot to me, my team, my friends and most importantly my fans.</p>
      <p>"Even if the outcome doesn't come back in my favour, please treat it as a normal boxing appeal."</p>
      <p>Paul was initially planning to give KSI the 'benefit of the doubt', but claimed he changed his mind after fans begged him to attempt an appeal.</p>

      <p>"My initial reaction was to fight it, to contest it, to try my hardest to make it right," Paul continued.</p>
      <p>"But I decided to let it go and give JJ the benefit of the doubt and go hands off, give the man his win he deserved it.</p>
      <p>"So I took the backseat and let life works itself out.</p>
      <p>"But then I get bombarded by thousands of people, fans, boxing fanatics, friends, random people on the street telling me the outcome of the fight just wasn't right."</p>
