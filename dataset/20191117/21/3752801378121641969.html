      <h1>Harsh action to be taken against KZN education officials after Grade 1 pupils go without teacher since May</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:02:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:02</time> by <a rel="author">Sesona Ngqakamba</a></address>
      <p>KwaZulu-Natal education department officials at circuit and district level along with management staff at a Pinetown school will face the music after failing to address the issue of Grade 1 pupils being without a teacher since May. </p>
      <p>Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu said it was revealed to him during a meeting with department management, the school governing board and principal of Shayamoya Primary School that 19 Grade 1 pupils have been without a teacher since May 1, 2019.  </p>
      <p>Mshengu had convened the meeting to address several challenges faced by the school. He said the revelation bordered on the infringement of pupils' constitutional right to access basic education.</p>
      <p>"We wish to extend our deepest apologies to the parents and community for this injustice. We also have been made aware that some of our officials [at school, circuit and district levels] failed to address the matter despite being advised by the concerned parents to fill the vacant post.</p>
      <p>"We can confirm that harsh action will be taken against those who dropped the ball," he added in a statement on Sunday. </p>
      <p>The MEC said he had directed that the vacant post be filled this week, adding candidates were qualified teachers who were already in the database of unplaced educators.</p>
      <p>Mshengu added the department remained committed to providing quality education to the youth of the province and wished to emphasise that the right to education was "sacrosanct and non-negotiable".</p>
