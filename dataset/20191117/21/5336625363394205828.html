      <p>It's not every day you hear a new song from the iconic Ms. Lauryn Hill. Actually, it's such a rarity that her most recent drop on Friday, Nov. 15, was the first solo song she released in half a decade.</p>
      <p>Despite her impressive discography and influence on hip hop history, Hill has only ever released one full solo album to date, the inaugural <i>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill </i>in 1998. But <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lauryn-hill-new-song-guarding-the-gates-queen-and-slim-913471/">according to <i>Rolling Stone</i></a>, she's been performing this new song, "Guarding the Gates," at live performances for years now.</p>
      <p>'Guarding the Gates' was released as part of the <i>Queen &amp; Slim</i> soundtrack, an upcoming romantic-thriller starring Daniel Kaluuya that confronts issues of race and police brutality. These subjects are all personal to Hill, as she dedicated her last solo song, 2014's "<a href="https://soundcloud.com/mslaurynhill">Black Rage</a>," to Ferguson. The lyrics of "Guarding the Gates" describe a narrator finding love while feeling perpetually persecuted, making it ideal fit for a film about the "black Bonnie and Clyde."</p>
