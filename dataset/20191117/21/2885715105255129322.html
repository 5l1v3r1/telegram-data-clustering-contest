      <h1>Gujarat Confidential: Day For Children</h1>
      <h2>World over, November 20 is being celebrated as Children’s Day by UNICEF.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:59:43+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>For the first time, the Social Justice &amp; Empowerment department of Gujarat government is planning to celebrate International Children’s Day that falls on November 20, in a unique way. The initiative has come from the Principal Secretary (Social Justice &amp; Empowerment) Manoj Aggarwal. The senior bureaucrat has reportedly asked his officials from the department to visit various child care institutes in the state and meet the children to make them feel special and part of the society. Aggarwal himself is likely to visit one such government recognised institute in Gandhinagar city where HIV+ children are being looked after. In India, November 14, the birth anniversary of first Prime Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jawaharlal-nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>, is celebrated as the Children’s Day. However, world over, November 20 is being celebrated as Children’s Day by UNICEF.</p>
      <h3>Who Will Be Next CS?</h3>
      <p>The top bureaucracy in the state secretariat is full of speculations over who will be the next Chief Secretary (CS) as the term of current CS JN Singh is ending this month. Many of the bureaucrats at the secretariat believe that the next CS could be somebody posted in Delhi and senior IAS officer, Guruprasad Mohapatra, who is on central deputation as Secretary of Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), seems to be a frontrunner. Officials say Mohapatra might not be willing to leave Delhi and would possibly be asked to serve “Gandhinagar”. “Sitting in Central Government, no officer would like to be restrained to a state… if any officer on central deputation is appointed as Gujarat CS, it would be on order of the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> leadership (PM <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/narendra-modi">Narendra Modi</a> and Home Minister Amit Shah) rather than his/her volition,” said a senior IAS officer.</p>
