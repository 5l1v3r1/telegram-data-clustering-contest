      <p>Pet hair all over their sofa or carpet can make cleaning up a real chore. So, if your dog tends to shed a lot, having one of the <a href="https://pawster.com/best-shedding-dog-shampoo/">best dog shampoos for shedding</a> won’t stop shedding entirely, but can definitely help. Deshedding shampoos are specially formulated with ingredients like <a href="https://dogcare.dailypuppy.com/deshedding-shampoo-dogs-work-3276.html">omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids</a>, and vitamin E to help reduce excess shedding, loosen up shedded hairs, and promote a healthy coat. Many of them have skin-soothing extracts like calendula to reduce itching and scratching, too.</p>
      <p>When you’re shopping around for a shampoo that’ll address your pet’s shedding, you’ll want to make sure it’s free of any harsh chemicals that can further irritate your pet. If your dog has sensitive skin, look for formulas free of fragrances, sulfates, dyes, and parabens. Using a shampoo that’s pH balanced for dogs (<a href="https://earthbath.com/canine-health/what-makes-a-quality-dog-shampoo/">who have a different skin pH than humans</a>) is also a plus.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.baysidepetresort.com/ask-a-groomer-does-my-dog-really-need-conditioner/">most dogs don’t need conditioner after a shampoo</a>, if your dog has dry skin, gets washed more than once a month, or gets tangled easily, it’s a good idea to follow up with a conditioner. I’ve included one in this list that has anti-shed ingredients omega-3 and omega-6, too. However, if your <a href="https://www.petmd.com/dog/care/why-do-dogs-shed">pet’s shedding pattern</a> has suddenly changed or they’re experiencing symptoms like itching or sores, it could be due to an underlying issue that you should discuss with a veterinarian.</p>
      <p>After you’re done using one of the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-4-best-dog-shampoos-18791715">best dog shampoos for shedding</a>, be sure to brush your pup daily, if possible, and a few times a week if not to remove any loose hair and avoid tangles.</p>

      <p>With more than 1,000 5-star reviews, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I2Y1CNU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-19310648-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00I2Y1CNU&amp;linkId=c502cd2328a8b7edaa4b5b6d4bea485b">FURminator deShedding dog shampoo</a> is a favorite for reducing shedding from the maker of the cult-favorite grooming tool. “It works.

This shampoo has omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, soothing calendula extract, and papaya leaf extract to condition your pup’s coat. It's recommended that you use it monthly.
