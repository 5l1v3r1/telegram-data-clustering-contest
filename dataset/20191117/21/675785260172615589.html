      <p>Stefanos Tsitsipas won the ATP Finals after coming from behind to record a three set victory over Austrian Dominic Thiem in London with a 6-7 (6-8), 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) win.</p>
      <p>It was the biggest win of Tsitsipas' young career so far on his debut appearance at the tournament, and after seeing off the great Roger Federer in the semi-final he clinched victory in the final after having to do it the hard way.</p>
      <p>Thiem won the first set after triumphing 8-6 in a nail-biting tie-break, but Tsitsipas roared back in the second with a 6-2 win</p>
      <p>It went down to the wire in the final set, with a second tie-break of the match, but Tsitsipas had enough to see off his opponent 7-4, and he collapsed to the ground after Thiem's shot wide sealed the victory.</p>

      <p>Speaking after the match to BBC Tsitsipas said: "I've no clue how I played so well in the second set, I think my mind was at ease and I didn't give him much opportunity to play.</p>
      <p>"It was frustrating to play with so many nerves but I'm so relieved I managed to win!"</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old Greek becomes the youngest ATP Finals debutant to win the competition since John McEnroe, who won it at the age of 19 in 1978, and the youngest ATP Finals champion at all since Lleyton Hewitt in 2001.</p>
      <p>This is the penultimate year the ATP Finals will be held in London, as after 2020's event it will move to Turin.</p>

      <p>All eyes will soon turn to the Australian Open, which will take place in Melbourne in January. After winning the European Open in Antwerp in October, it is thought that Andy Murray could return to play in Australia, exactly a year after admitting he may have to retire.</p>
