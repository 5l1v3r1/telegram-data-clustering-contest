      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:31:40+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/anil-panchal" target="_blank">Anil Panchal</a></address>
      <p>The US President Donald Trump on Sunday welcomed a “cash” payout to American farmers before the Thanksgiving Day holiday that he attributed to China tariffs, but that money actually is part of a US government aid package, as said by the Reuters.</p>
      <p>The news relies on the US President’s latest tweets while also citing the latest trade talks between the United States (US) and Chinese diplomats conducted on Friday.</p>
      <h3>Key quotes</h3>
      <p>“Our great Farmers will recieve (sic) another major round of ‘cash,’ compliments of China Tariffs, prior to Thanksgiving.”</p>
      <p>“The smaller farms and farmers will be big beneficiaries. In the meantime, and as you may have noticed, China is starting to buy big again. Japan deal DONE. Enjoy!”</p>
      <p>"The payments are the second part of a three-tranche $16 billion aid package announced in May to compensate farmers for the U.S.-China trade war."</p>
      <h4>FX implications</h4>
      <p>This adds to the market’s recent trade positive <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a> which relies mainly on the US-China story. As a result, Antipodeans will have a good time while the safe-havens might have to witness further weakness.</p>
