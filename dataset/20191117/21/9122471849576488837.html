      <h1>Video: Redskins Fans Send Message To Owner Daniel Snyder</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:31:42+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The Washington Redskins are in the waning minutes of a blowout loss to the New York Jets. At 1-8 on the season – soon to be 1-9 – the team has long-since been knocked out of any realistic playoff contention.</p>
      <p>But after firing head coach Jay Gruden earlier this year, the Washington Redskins fans have turned their anger towards the man at the top: Owner Daniel Snyder.</p>
      <p>In the middle of the game, with Washington struggling mightily on offense, fans began chanting “Sell the team!”</p>

      <p>A loss today will secure the third-straight losing season for Washington, and their eighth in the last 11 years.</p>
      <p>As bad as the 2019 season has been going for Washington, many fans might consider it a microcosm of Daniel Snyder’s entire run as owner.</p>
      <p>Since buying the team prior to the 1999 season, Washington has made just five playoff appearances and struggled to find any sustained success as a franchise.</p>
      <p>That tenure has also been marred by the slow deterioration of their home at FedEx Field. Despite multiple attempts to renovate and expand the stadium, it’s still widely considered one of the worst stadiums in the country.</p>
      <p>Washington is a proud franchise with a long history. While they can never force Snyder to sell the team, they can make their team’s owner hurt in the pockets if they want to take their frustrations to the next level.</p>
