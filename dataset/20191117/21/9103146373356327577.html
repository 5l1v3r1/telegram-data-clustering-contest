      <p>The out-going Archbishop of the Church of the Province of Uganda, the Most Reverend Stanley Ntagali has bid farewell to the fraternity of Joint Medical Store, a private not-for-profit non-governmental organisation co-established by the Uganda Protestant Medical Bureau and the Uganda Catholic Medical Bureau (1979). The coordinated organisation procures/stores and distributes human medication and health-related consumable items to health units across the country.<br/><br/>Ntagali visited the organisation’s headquarters in Nsambya on Wednesday morning. He was welcomed jubilantly by the staff of the organisation, led by the Executive Director, Dr Bildard Baguma and the organisation’s Board Chairman, Dr Lawrence Ojom.</p>

      <p>The function started with a thanksgiving service presided over by Ntagali, the Provincial Secretary of the Church of Uganda, Canon William Ogeng and the organisation’s Anglican Chaplain, Rev George William Kyeyune.<br/><br/>Dr Lawrence Ojom, who spoke on behalf of the fraternity of Joint Medical Store, spoke highly of Ntagali’s extra-ordinary commitment and support to the organisation.  He said the organisation’s steady growth during the past three years was attributable to Ntagali’s visionary leadership and inter-personal skills.</p>

      <p>“There is a popular saying that leaders are born but are chosen by God. This saying applies to you appropriately, our dear Archbishop Ntagali. You were indeed a gift to the fraternity of Joint Medical Store. Further to being a co-founder and co-owner, you have also been a regular customer, coming personally to the organisation’s premises to buy medicine for the people.</p>

      <p>“During your leadership, the organisation has grown significantly. Branches have been opened in places such as Mbarara, Arua, Fort Portal and Masaka. There has also been international bench-marking through international certification. The partnership between Joint Medical Store and the institutions of the Church of the Province of Uganda has also grown significantly. It is during your reign that the organisation has ventured into manufacturing,” Dr Ojom acknowledged.<br/><br/>Ojom’s remarks were echoed by the organisation’s Executive Director, Dr Bildard Baguma, who spoke about Ntagali’s contribution to ecumenism.</p>

      <p>“Just recently, when we were celebrating our 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary, we held a joint symposium of the House of Bishops and the Uganda Episcopal Conference, which went very well. This was possible because of your good leadership and support. You don’t only co-own this organisation but you also know it well. You have also been our regular customer.”<br/><br/>In his thanksgiving remarks, Archbishop Ntagali commended the Board of Governors, Management and Staff of Joint Medical Store for their commitment to the service of humanity. He cautioned them against vices such as selfishness and greed for money and power, which he said had made many people to forsake God.</p>

      <p>“Some people have replaced God with selfish desires such as money and power. They have even changed our country’s motto. Instead of saying <i>For God and My Country</i>, they now say, For God and their stomach.<br/><br/>“As I say farewell to you dear staff of Joint Medical Store, I urge you to maintain your excellence and integrity which has made your service exceptional. We know there are some people out there who sell fake, expired medicines which endanger the health of our people, but you have always been professional in your way of doing things. Please keep up you reputation.”</p>

      <p>Ntagali attributed all his achievements to the grace of God, who he said had enabled him to prevail over the challenges of his leadership. He said much as he was retiring from official church work, he would not retire from preaching the Gospel.<br/><br/>“It is God who has enabled me to accomplish my tasks. There is nothing that I have achieved by my power. I have not been pushed out of office. I have just reached the mandatory retirement age of 65. So, I am just retiring from full-time Church work, but I will continue to preach the gospel.”<br/><br/>The joint choir of JMS led the sing during the Holy Communion Service.<br/><br/>The Board of Joint Medical Store gave Archbishop Ntagali a digital weighing scale machine, in appreciation of his love and commitment to the organisation.</p>
