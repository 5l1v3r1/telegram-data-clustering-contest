      <h2>The supplement company, Duchesnay Inc., says these packages contain the incorrect combination of pills</h2>

      <p>A packaging error has led to the recall of a prenatal and a postpartum supplement across Canada.</p>
      <p>Health Canada says Duchesnay Inc. has issued a recall over PregVit folic 5 vitamin-mineral supplements and PregVit vitamin-mineral supplements due to an incorrect combination of pills.</p>
      <p>According to Duchesnay Inc., these packages should contain pink and blue tablets for morning and evening use.</p>
      <p>Currently, the defective packages only contain pink tablets, which do not contain the same active ingredients as the blue tablets.</p>
      <p>Women who consume only the pink tablets will not receive vital vitamins or minerals needed for healthy fetus development, like folic acid, which can decrease the risk of some types of birth defects.</p>
      <p>Duchesnay Inc. says proper packages should contain 15 pink and 15 blue pills in two blister packages.</p>
      <p>Although there are no quality, safety or effectiveness concerns, Health Canada says anyone who has purchased a defective package is being advised to talk to their pharmacist about receiving a new one.</p>
      <p>Consumers can also call Duchesnay Inc. at 1-888-666-0611 for any questions or concerns about these products.</p>
