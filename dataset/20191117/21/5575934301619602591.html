        <li>A “Fox News Sunday” segment between the host Chris Wallace and Rep. Steve Scalise was the target of President Donald Trump on Sunday, as he <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1196148537525977088?s=21">tweeted that</a> Wallace was “nasty and obnoxious.”</li>
        <li>Trump also said Scalise “blew” Wallace “away,” attacked the morning show’s ratings, and argued that the “dumb and unfair interview would never have happened in the @FoxNews past.”</li>
        <li>Apart from congratulating Scalise, who <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/chris-wallace-accuses-gop-rep-steve-scalise-of-very-badly-mischaracterizing-impeachment-testimony">stuck to</a> the Trump administration’s talking points about the impeachment hearings, and suggesting that Wallace “will never be his father,” Mike Wallace, Trump also appeared critical of Wallace snapping back at Scalise.</li>
        <li>Wallace <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1196122966960099329">pushed back at Scalise</a> for seeking to discredit the officials who had testified so far in House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.</li>

      <p>President Donald Trump bashed the “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace on Twitter after a segment with Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana about the week’s impeachment hearings.</p>
      <p>“.@SteveScalise blew the nasty &amp; obnoxious Chris Wallace (will never be his father, Mike!) away on Chris’s lowest rated (unless I’m on) morning show,” <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1196148537525977088?s=21">Trump wrote on Sunday</a>. “This kind of dumb and unfair interview would never have happened in the @FoxNews past. Great job Steve!”</p>
      <p>Wallace’s father, Mike Wallace, who died in 2012, was a longtime original correspondent for CBS’ “60 Minutes” news program.</p>
      <p>Trump can readily expect support from Fox News’ opinion hosts, but he has been vocally critical of the network whenever any of its news segments paint him in a negative light. <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1182281834970980352">Recently, he has been tweeting</a> that the channel is “much different” from what it used to be.</p>
      <p>“We have to start looking for a new News Outlet,” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1166712943196680193">Trump tweeted in August</a>. “Fox isn’t working for us anymore!” He has also spoken favourably of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/one-america-news-donald-trump-news-network-2019-10">One America News</a>, which runs flattering stories about the president.</p>

      <p>During Sunday’s interview, Wallace pushed back when Scalise sought to discredit those who had testified in House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>“Well, those were Schiff’s witnesses,” Scalise said, referring to Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, after Wallace said that numerous US officials who had listened in on Trump’s phone call that sparked the inquiry were “immediately upset” by what Trump said.</p>
      <p>“No, sir, they’re career foreign-service officers and these are people who work in the Trump administration,” Wallace said, noting that Vice President Mike Pence’s aide Jennifer Williams said in her <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/16/779946508/read-testimony-of-jennifer-williams-aide-to-vice-president-pence">closed-door deposition</a>, released Saturday, that the conversation was “inappropriate.”</p>
      <p>As confirmed by a summary of the July 25 call released by the White House, Trump asked Ukraine’s president multiple times to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden – a 2020 presidential contender – and a conspiracy theory involving the 2016 US election. An anonymous official who learned about the call filed a whistleblower complaint that sparked the impeachment investigation. Officials have further testified that they believed Trump conditioned military aid to Ukraine on Zelensky publicly announcing such politically motivated investigations.</p>
      <p>Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1196155347117002752">also tweeted</a> Sunday about Williams, writing: “Tell Jennifer Williams, whoever that is, to read BOTH transcripts of the presidential calls, &amp; see the just released ststement from Ukraine. Then she should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don’t know &amp; mostly never even heard of, &amp; work out a better presidential attack!”</p>

      <p>Wallace also suggested that the coming testimony of Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/gordon-sondland-flaunted-access-to-trump-ukraine-investigation-2019-11">who has knowledge of</a> the Ukraine dealings at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, could “blow a hole” in Trump’s defence.</p>
      <p>“If Gordon Sondland, who met with the president a half dozen times this summer, testifies on Wednesday, ‘Yep, the president said to me we’re not releasing the aid until they announce they’re going to investigate the Bidens and Burisma,’ doesn’t that blow a hole in the president’s defence?” Wallace asked.</p>
      <p>Scalise responded that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had publicly denied feeling pressured and said the two presidents were the only ones on the phone call; Wallace noted that a dozen people were listening in, too.</p>
      <p>“The real bottom line is he got the money,” Scalise said – the military aid was ultimately released under pressure from Congress. “Ukraine got the money.”</p>
