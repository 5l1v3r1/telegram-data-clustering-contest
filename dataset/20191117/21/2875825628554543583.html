      <h2>The 21-year-old Greek held his nerve to win in a tie-break after a three set thriller as it ended 6-7 (6-8), 6-2, 7-6 (7-4)</h2>

      <p>A new star was born at The O2 last night as Stefanos Tsitsipas became the youngest debut winner of the Nitto ATP Finals since John McEnroe.</p>
      <p>The long-haired Greek, who looks more like Bjorn Borg, was urged to the biggest win of his young career by an adoring O2 crowd.</p>
      <p>And the 21-year-old dropped his racquet and fell to his knees theatrically before kissing Dominic Thiem in celebration and consolation. The blond bombshell plays the crowd as well as he plays tennis. This Greek God has got the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> .</p>
      <p>“You guys made me feel so emotional - I have never seen so much support on a stage like that,” said the world No.6. “I owe it all to you.</p>
      <p>“It was phenomenal. It was unbelievable to have have an army behind me. They gave me belief to achieve what I have achieved on the court. They gave me so much energy. I just love that. I would like to thank every single person who came to support with a Greek flag. It made me feel at home.</p>

      <p>Tsitsipas is the fourth consecutive first-time winner of this season-ending event. Only 19-year-old McEnroe was younger when he took this title for the first time in 1978.</p>
      <p>The Greek, who won the Next Gen event last year, started this season by beating Roger Federer on his way to the Australian Open semi-finals. And he finished it by beating the Swiss superstar again in the first event since 2010 where all of the the Big Three entered and none reached the final. It could finally signal the changing of the old guard.</p>
      <p>Former champion Boris Becker said: “A superstar is born in my eyes. He is box office. The sport is in safe hands.”</p>
      <p>For the second time this year, a London final was decided in a thrilling final-set tiebreak. At Wimbledon, Novak Djokovic won the first ever version the longest ever singles final at the All England Club. And last night on the Greenwich Peninsula Tsitsipas won the longest final at The O2 6-7 6-2 7-6 in two hours and 35 minutes.</p>

      <p>Thiem won the first set tiebreak after 65 minutes before Tsitsipas blitzed the second set in 26 minutes while dropping only two points on his serve. The Austrian fought back from a break down in the decider – and again from 4-1 down in the tiebreak – before the Greek took his first match point when Thiem could not control another blazing serve.</p>
      <p>“This fight was a truly magnificent,” said Tsitsipas. “It makes our sport great. Tennis is all about this.</p>
      <p>“I've no clue how I played so well in the second set, I think my mind was at ease and I didn't give him much opportunity to play.It was frustrating to play with so many nerves but I'm so relieved I managed to win! It has been a rollercoaster. Holding this trophy feeling amazing.”</p>
      <p>Thiem, who lost his second French Open final in June, said: “We played an unbelievable final. We are playing the most brutal sport which exists, it was so close. Both were fighting 100% to the end. That is how it is in tennis. I really hope we are going to have some great finals in the future as well.”</p>
      <p>Frenchmen Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut, who lost in the final last year, claimed the doubles title by beating cruised beat Raven Klaasen and Michael Venus 6-3 6-4.</p>
