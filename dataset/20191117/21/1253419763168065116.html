      <h1>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare November 15th update fixes the stuttering cut-scenes issue, improves stability</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:24:57+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:24</time> by <a rel="author">John Papadopoulos</a></address>
      <p>Infinity Ward and Beenox have released a brand new update for the PC version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. This new patch finally fixes the stuttering issues that players experienced during the pre-rendered cut-scenes.</p>
      <p>These stuttering issues were <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/pc-performance-analyses/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-pc-performance-analysis/">one of our biggest gripe with COD: MW</a>. So yeah, itâ€™s at least good knowing that Beenox has heard its fanbase and fixed them. Here is hoping that it will also address or minimize the pop-in issues.</p>
      <p>The November 15th update also improves overall stability. Furthermore, it includes a fix for Dev Error 6178.</p>
      <p>As always, Battlenet will download this patch the next time you launch its launcher, and you can find its complete changelog below.</p>
