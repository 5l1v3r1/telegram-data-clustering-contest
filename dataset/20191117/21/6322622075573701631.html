      <h1>Hong Kong Protest Intensifies With Threat of Live Ammunition</h1>

      <p>(Nov 18): Hong Kong police and protesters hardened their battle lines over the weekend, with violent clashes culminating in a standoff at a local university early Monday morning where law enforcement officials said live ammunition may be used.</p>
      <p>The weekend saw pitched battles as demonstrators launched bricks, Molotov cocktails and steel balls at police, who in turn volleyed tear gas and deployed water cannons. A police media-liaison officer was hit in the leg by an arrow, while protesters tossed petrol bombs at residents clearing streets strewn with bricks.</p>
      <p>Police were preparing to clear the remaining demonstrators from Hong Kong Polytechnic University -- with the “dispersal operation” dragging through the early hours of Monday morning as they warned that they could open fire if they faced violence. Tear gas was being fired outside the university and fire could be seen in some of the live media feeds. Earlier, a water cannon was used earlier to disperse hundreds of protesters dug in at the school.</p>
      <p>Owan Li, a student representative at the university, told reporters early Monday morning that he didn’t know how many people were still in the school, and made a plea to avoid bloodshed.<br/><b>Access Blocked</b></p>
      <p>“We hope to use this opportunity to tell the Hong Kong people that we need the help from all our friends,” he said. “I really hope that there will be a solution” for the students and staff to leave the campus safely.</p>
      <p>In the area near the school, cars were parked in the middle of streets to block police access.</p>
      <p>“The police will also follow up investigations and investigate those who deliberately use vehicles to block roads and obstruct police actions,” Hong Kong’s police force said in a tweet Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the weekend, soldiers from China’s People’s Liberation Army took the rare step of leaving their barracks to join clean-up efforts. The move added to the concern by some about China’s growing control over the former British colony that’s fueled five months of protests.</p>
      <p>With tensions running high, schools will remain suspended Monday on safety concerns. The escalating violence also threatens to delay district council elections scheduled for next Sunday. There are signs, too, that Hong Kong society is becoming more polarized, as protest-weary residents who helped clean up the city’s streets were harassed by demonstrators.</p>
      <p>“Violence and hatred are devouring the entire society and put Hong Kong into extreme danger,” Financial Secretary Paul Chan wrote in his weekly blog on Sunday. “People should distance themselves from violence more than ever before.”</p>
      <p>Trains and subway stations were once again damaged, with the East Rail Line to operate with limited train service on Monday while the Intercity Through Trains will remain suspended, rail operator MTR said Sunday.</p>
      <p>As the list of casualties and damage grows, so too are the cracks in Hong Kong’s economy and international reputation. The government is forecasting the first annual contraction since the global financial crisis a decade ago, and unemployment is predicted to rise.</p>
      <p>Gross domestic product will contract 1.3% from 2018, the government said Friday as it released final output calculations for the third quarter.</p>
      <p>The government said ending the city’s violent unrest is key to an economic recovery.</p>
      <p>One of the protesters’ key demands is the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry to examine the use of force by police, which, according to a recent poll, has the overwhelming support of Hong Kong people.</p>
      <p>About 80% of Hong Kong adults want the government to set up an independent commission of inquiry, according to a new survey by Hong Kong Public Opinion Program. That’s up from 77% earlier this month. The government has so far ruled out any further political concessions to the protesters.</p>
      <p>Activity shifted to universities last week as students sought refuge. As the standoff at Polytechnic University continued, a five-day face-off between activists and officers at Chinese University of Hong Kong ended on Friday after vice chancellor Rocky Tuan urged people to leave the campus.</p>
      <p>Sonny Lo, a political commentator who’s written books on the city’s relationship with Beijing, said the government still has options -- among them, considering whether to set up a reconciliation committee. Another is calling a temporary truce so that elections can be held.</p>
      <p>“It could be a combined approach,” he said. If the people of Hong Kong, including the protesters, want the election to be held, there should be a temporary truce, and if peace holds, a reconciliation committee can be set up. Maybe then there will be a “realist possibility of a breakthrough,” Lo said. - Bloomberg</p>
