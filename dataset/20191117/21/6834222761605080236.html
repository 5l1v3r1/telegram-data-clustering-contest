      <p><b>Fabio Quartararo's first season in MotoGP has just ended. </b>The French rider was the true revelation of this 2019 and, apart from a few isolated cases - Dovizioso, Rins and Vinales - he was <b>the only real thorn in Marc Marquez's side</b>, especially in qualifying. With today's second position, Quartararo won this e seventh podium of the season, and six pole positions.<b> The numbers of a veteran, not a rookie.</b></p>
      <p><i><b>It's been a perfect year,"</b></i>  Fabio confirmed<i>. "At the beginning of the last season</i><b><i>, everyone was saying that</i></b><i> <b>I didn't deserve this place</b>. I worked for this unique opportunity and have always been ahead."</i></p>
      <p>
        <b>You seem to be more comfortable with the MotoGP than the Moto2. Why?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Yes, maybe.<b> Since I got this opportunity with Yamaha, my brain has totally changed </b>and focuses only on the MotoGP. Even when I'm home, I think of the MotoGP. I watch the races. I'm concentrated to the maximum."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>But after seven podiums, I'm still missing a victory. Can you reach Marquez's level?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"I have<b> to improve to keep fighting with Marquez.</b> He has something more than me. He's at his best, and he has a bike that fits him. I'm in my first year, and I've worked a lot. I'm fast in qualifying, but I'm still miss something ."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Tuesday, the new season will start with a <b>Yamaha that is slowly catching up with Honda and Ducati.</b> Have you<b> already given indications for developing the bike to Iwata's engineers?</b></p>
      <p>
        <i>"<b>Yamaha won't follow my test directions</b>. I dot know if it's a mistake or not. The engine must improve because we lose a lot from Marquez in the straight”.</i>
