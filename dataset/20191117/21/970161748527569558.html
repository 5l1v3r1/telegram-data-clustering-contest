        <b>Ronnie O’Sullivan was beaten 9-7 by Judd Trump in the final of the Northern Ireland Open for the second successive year, but insists, ‘I’ve had a good day.’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Trump controlled the final from the off, leading throughout, and making four centuries en route to claiming the £70,000 top prize.</p>
      <p>O’Sullivan managed to keep his hopes alive over the match, but was always hanging on and trying to stay in touch with the world champion who was in spectacular form.</p>
      <p>Two centuries of his own showed that the Rocket was playing well, but it wasn’t enough against a man who is unarguably the best on the planet right now.</p>
      <p>The five-time world champion was certainly not too downbeat about the loss, insisting that he enjoyed the game and the tournament as a whole.</p>

      <p>‘It was open, free-playing, attacking, quite quick as well which is nice,’ said O’Sullivan after the loss. ‘It was a good match, I think everyone must have enjoyed watching that. It was good to be involved in.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve loved it, enjoyed every minute of it, even that match there, I was enjoying watching Judd, playing some fantastic shots, great break-building, the crowd were fantastic, I’ve had a good day.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a brilliant series, everyone’s enjoying it.’</p>

      <p>O’Sullivan will now attempt to defend his UK Championship title in York with the tournament getting underway on 26 November at the Barbican in York.</p>
      <p>Presented with the prospect of that challenge, the Rocket simply said: ‘The coffee’s good in York so I’m looking forward to that.’</p>
      <p>Trump will take home the £70,000 top prize, with O’Sullivan forced to settle for the £30,000 runners-up reward.</p>
      <p>He will not be going up with his runners-up trophy, though, as he made the classy gesture of handing it over to a loyal fan in the crowd who had been supporting him in Belfast all week.</p>
