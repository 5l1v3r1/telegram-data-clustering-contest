      <p>A couple whose relationship broke down when they suffered a pregnancy loss have reunited almost 15 years later and are celebrating a miracle baby.</p>
      <p>Karen, 36, and Sam Cranfield, 44, met when Karen was 17 and Sam was 25 and both worked at the same pub in Louisa Bay near Ramsgate, Kent.</p>
      <p>Their relationship was broken beyond repair when two years after being together they lost a baby, a trauma which left Karen infertile.</p>
      <p>The pregnancy was molar – where a non-viable egg implants and develops into a mass of cells instead of a baby.</p>
      <p>Doctors removed the growth from Karen, apparently destroying her fertility in the process and leading to her pushing Sam away.</p>
      <p>Karen said she knew she had made a mistake but never imagined they would get back together.</p>
      <p>She explained: ‘I never for a second knew that we’d end up back together and with a baby I didn’t think I’d have.</p>

      <p>‘I told him I didn’t love him anymore. It was a lie. The worst lie I’ve ever told in my life.’</p>
      <p>After Sam failed to rekindle the relationship, the couple both remarried and he had daughter Perri, 14.</p>
      <p>Karen married the year after splitting with Sam but the marriage ended in 2010.</p>
      <p>She met a new partner and looked into IVF in 2013 – but doctors told her she had no chance of becoming a mum because of low ovarian reserves and severe scarring in her womb.</p>
      <p>She broke up with her new partner shortly after that but fate was at last about to hand her some good news – a Facebook message from Sam</p>
      <p>The pair met for dinner in June 2016 and, a month later, Sam proposed by hiding a bunch of flowers and a diamond ring in his wardrobe.</p>

      <p>Sam quit his job in London and moved back to Kent in September 2016 and the couple learnt Sam was pregnant the following summer</p>
      <p>Baby Louisa was born on March 10 last year at the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Hospital – the same place the couple lost their baby in 2002.</p>
      <p>The couple married at Ramsgate Register Office when Louisa was six weeks old.</p>
      <p>Sam, 43, said he still can’t quite believe his story has had such a happy ending.</p>
      <p>He explained: ‘I was heartbroken when Karen first dumped me. I got ridiculed at work because I was so miserable for so long.</p>

      <p>‘I thought of her all the time over the years. It was meant to be.’</p>
