      <h1>Arsenal fans react to Lucas Torreira’s reported request</h1>

        <b>A number of Arsenal fans have taken to Twitter to react to <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/da-xhaka-fino-a-torreira-il-milan-e-le-vere-operazioni-imbastite-24948">reports from Calciomercato this week</a> suggesting that Lucas Torreira has told the Gunners hierarchy that he would like the club to consider offers that come in for him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Torreira has endured a frustrating season at the Emirates. The 23-year-old has started just four Premier League games. And it appears that plenty of supporters feel that he is being used incorrectly by Unai Emery.</p>

      <p>He has been pushed forward into a more advanced role more recently. And that has angered some fans who are adamant that the Uruguayan’s best position is in holding midfield.</p>
      <p>And it appears that they are not the only ones who are annoyed. <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/da-xhaka-fino-a-torreira-il-milan-e-le-vere-operazioni-imbastite-24948">Calciomercato has reported this week</a> that Torreira has told Arsenal that he would like the club to consider offers that come in for him.</p>

      <p>It is not clear what the Gunners’ stance is. But it seems that a number of the supporters would let the same person go – and it is not Torreira.</p>
      <p>Emery is coming under increasing pressure at North London. The Gunners have not won in the Premier League for well over a month. And the Spaniard does not appear to be helping himself with some quite strange decisions.</p>
      <p>One of those involves Torreira and the role that he has been using him in. And plenty of Arsenal fans have insisted that the reports further highlight the need to remove Emery.</p>
      <p>There will be a lot of anger if Torreira is sold. And some of the supporters have warned that he may not be the last to go if Emery sticks around for much longer.</p>
      <p>Here is what some of the fans made of the recent reports…</p>
