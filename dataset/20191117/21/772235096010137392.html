      <p>The motoring world isn't kind to old technology. The average model cycle is eight years, with a styling change halfway through to keep things fresh – if you're really good at facelifts, maybe a model can be stretched to 12 or 13 years.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bentley/"><b>Bentley</b></a> doesn't really work on the same timelines as the rest of the motoring industry, though. Forget 12 years, the V8 engine in the current <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bentley/mulsanne/">Mulsanne</a> has just turned 60.</p>
      <p>Debuted in the 1959 Bentley S2 as a replacement for the brand's long-serving straight-six engine, the bent-eight has powered 23 models throughout its life. It started as a 6.2-litre unit, before growing to the current 6.75-litre displacement in 1971.</p>

      <p>The motor has been redesigned to fit into smaller engine bays, reworked for emissions regulations and, with the launch of the 1985 Mulsanne Turbo, treated to forced-induction.</p>
      <p>After starting as a single-turbo engine, the V8 gained a second turbocharger. It's also been treated to modern technology, such as cylinder deactivation, to keep it in line with modern emissions rules – but Bentley maintains the modern twin-turbo iteration still has its roots in the 1959 original.</p>
      <p>"The original V8 was designed to deliver a step-change in performance, along with smoothness, reliability and refinement," said Dr Werner Tietz, member of the board for engineering at Bentley.</p>

      <p>"The engine was tested over hundreds of thousands of miles in the toughest conditions, as well as at full throttle for 500 hours. The success of Bentley’s acclaimed 6¾-litre V8 today in the Mulsanne owes much to that ethos."</p>
      <p>It's currently fitted to the Mulsanne and Mulsanne Speed, where it outputs <b>395kW</b> and <b>1100Nm.</b></p>
