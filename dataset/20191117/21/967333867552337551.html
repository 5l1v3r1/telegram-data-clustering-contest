      <p>Over the past several years, as they have liberated Syria of a broad assortment of terrorist groups, including Daesh (ISIS)* and the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front,* the Syrian military has discovered a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201904161074197522-us-israeli-arms-found-in-syria-again/">wide variety</a> of Western and Israeli-made weapons, from small arms and grenades and mortar launchers to communications equipment, field hospital supplies to US-made <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201903291073640190-syria-us-made-weapons-tow/">TOW anti-tank missiles</a>, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201906031075574429-syria-c4-explosive-seizure/">C4 explosives</a>, and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201908051076467363-syrian-army-finds-jihad-mobile-rocket-launchers-tank-left-behind-by-fleeing-terrorists-video/">even tanks</a>.</p>
      <p>The Quneitra region, an area of the Golan Heights partially held by Israel since the June 1967 Arab-Israeli War, has been a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201908011076429959-israel-attacks-syrias-quneitra-with-rockets--report/">source of tension</a> between the two Middle Eastern countries for decades, with skirmishes regularly reported along the contested border area even before the outbreak of the foreign-backed Syrian conflict in 2011. During the war, Daesh <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201906021075559135-mount-hermon-ski-resort/">established a stronghold</a> in Syria’s Quneitra region, with the terrorists finally vanquished from the area completely in 2018.</p>
