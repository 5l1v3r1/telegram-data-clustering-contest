      <h2>LFC Stories: An exclusive chat with former Liverpool full back Connor Randall</h2>

      <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold wasn’t the first homegrown right-back to catch Jurgen Klopp’s eye at Liverpool.</p>
      <p>During the German’s first sessions on the pristine pitches of the club’s Melwood training ground, 19-year-old Connor Randall impressed sufficiently to be included in the matchday squad for Klopp’s first game in charge, away to Tottenham in October 2015. Eleven days later, he made his competitive debut, starting in a 1-0 win over Bournemouth in the fourth round of the League Cup.</p>
      <p>“It was a feeling I don’t think I’ll ever be able to describe,” Randall tells LFC Stories of first realising he’d been selected to make his debut. “It was obviously excitement. It’s something you’ve been waiting for your whole life and you realise it’s going to happen the next day. It was a big moment. Leaving training, ringing your mum and dad to tell them you’re playing – it’s massive for them. Then being able to play, it’s a massive moment.”</p>
      <p>A new contract quickly followed, and Randall finished his maiden senior campaign with an encouraging seven appearances to his name. As Liverpool began to trace a steep upward trajectory under Klopp, though, the young defender struggled to sustain his initial impact, making just one further first-team appearance before the deal he’d excitedly penned in December 2015 was allowed to lapse last summer.</p>
      <p>Venturing an unorthodox path in his efforts to regain lost momentum in his career, Randall, who is still only 24, signed for Bulgarian side Arda Kardzhali in September. Owned and well-funded by a road construction company, Arda earned promotion to the top flight for the first time just last season. Randall is a long way from home, and further still from where he likely envisioned his career would be by this stage. “It wasn’t the plan. When you make your debut, you want things to go in a different way,” he admits. “But things happen the way they do.”</p>
      <p>Even before he first joined the club as a six-year-old, Liverpool FC was in Randall’s blood. His father and grandfather were both dyed-in-the-wool Reds, and he remembers early trips to Anfield, feeding a growing idolisation of Steven Gerrard.</p>
      <p>“When I was growing up, watching Gerrard and [Jamie] Carragher, local lads, they’d done what we all dreamed as Liverpool fans from Liverpool,” says Randall, who grew up in Melling, a stone’s throw from the Kirkby academy. “Gerrard was an unbelievable player. For everyone around that era supporting the team, he was everyone’s hero.”</p>
      <p>Randall was spotted playing locally for Waddicar Dolphins, a team run by his dad, and invited to train with Liverpool. Like Alexander-Arnold, he was a central midfielder throughout his youth, and he stood out among his age group for his athleticism, determination and a natural authority which saw him captain the Reds at under-18 and reserve level.</p>
      <p>The conversion to full-back came relatively late, and somewhat by chance. Returning into the under-18s fold from injury, the then-17-year-old was asked to fill in at right-back in order to both plug a problem position for the side and rack up some valuable minutes in his recovery. “I ended up doing quite well and it was something that the staff decided, to play me there,” Randall recalls.</p>
      <p>His first exposure to the first-team environment came during Brendan Rodgers’ reign, often over international breaks to make up the numbers while the squad was depleted, and he made the bench a few times under the former Swansea and Watford boss. But it was the arrival of Klopp which proved the catalyst for Randall’s breakthrough into the senior set-up.</p>
      <p>“When [Klopp] came in, he was a massive name and everyone was really excited,” Randall says. “I remember one of his early sessions. Mick Beale was the coach for the reserves at the time, he’d told [Klopp] who was coming through the academy and who fit the profile of players that he liked. It was me and Cam Brannagan who went up for one of his first sessions. It was a great experience and luckily I got to go up there on a permanent basis. I’ll always be grateful for that opportunity. It’s something that has helped me massively as a player, to learn under some of the best coaches and players.</p>
      <p>“As a Liverpool fan, you’re playing and training with all these players you’ve admired for years. Once I got up there full time, it was a good achievement, but it was just more of an opportunity to learn and to train with some of the best players in the world. But it was a bit of a surreal experience, being a fan and training and walking around the place with players you’ve watched growing up.”</p>
      <p>The excitement of Randall’s initial foray into the first-team dampened by Klopp’s second season. A 45-minute run-out in an FA Cup defeat to Wolves was his only senior appearance all season, and he only once made the matchday squad for a Premier League fixture, remaining an unused substitute away to Crystal Palace in October.</p>
      <p>“Obviously, I’d have liked to have pushed on and done more, but that’s how it happened. It was disappointing,” he concedes. “Things didn’t work out the way you planned, but that’s football. You’ve got to take things as they are and keep looking to concentrate on yourself and what you’re up to.”</p>
      <p>Having slid down the pecking order and out of Klopp’s thoughts, Randall went out on loan for the 2017-18 season in search of regular game time. He joined Hearts in the Scottish Premiership and played 27 times for the Edinburgh club, in what remains the most consistent period of senior football in his career.</p>
      <p>“It was time to go and find first-team football somewhere else and try and push on,” Randall says of his season north of the border. “It was a good experience up there and I really enjoyed it. You go away and experience new things, playing regularly, proper men’s first-team football – that’s vital for any lad coming through. You’ve got to get that football in and you see what it does for players. Living up there and working at Hearts, it was a good season and I enjoyed it.”</p>
      <p>Even then, though, he knew his performances with Hearts were likely to have little bearing on his hopes of longevity with Liverpool. Instead, he viewed his time in Scotland as a chance to mature as a footballer, so that he’d be better equipped for whether lay ahead.</p>
      <p>“The perfect scenario would be to play in the [Liverpool] first team, but it’s not realistic sometimes,” he says. “When I went there, it was a case of getting the football under my belt, trying to have a good season and whatever happens from there happens.”</p>
      <p>This is typical of the humility and realism Randall exudes. Through the highs and lows of his still-young career, he has remained even-keeled, never allowing the hype to distort his self-image, nor the struggles to shake his self-confidence.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s just part of my character,” he says. “Getting brought up in a good way and having come through the academy since I was six, having good things drilled into you every day, and out of football from your parents, that all contributes. I’ve never been one to get too carried away with anything.”</p>
      <p>After his season with Hearts, Randall went out on loan again at the start of the 2018-19 term, this time to Rochdale in League One. Less than a month in, though, he sustained a broken cheekbone in a Checkatrade Trophy game against Bury. It was his second game for Rochdale and, with the injury requiring surgery, he would make just one more outing for the club before returning to Liverpool in January. “I knew then that my contract was running down,” Randall says. “I wanted to keep as fit as possible and see what happens over the summer.”</p>
      <p>Last summer, for the first time since he was six years old, Randall could no longer call himself a Liverpool player. The search for a new club began and, after tentative discussions with a couple of sides closer to home, he accepted Arda’s offer to join their ambitious bid to challenge Ludogorets’ recent dominance of Bulgarian football.</p>
      <p>“It’s tough for lads who are out of contract. You’re working hard but nothing is set in stone. You’re looking for your next job. It can be a difficult time. A lot of lads are in the same situation, looking for clubs, and there are only so many that can be taken.</p>
      <p>“When [the offer from Arda] came up, I had a call about it. They wanted me to sign. I came over and spoke to the club. It was exciting, a new, fresh challenge for me. You come out of your comfort zone a little bit by moving abroad.</p>
      <p>“It’s different, but I think I’ve settled in well. A few of the lads speak English, and I’m trying to pick up a few words in Bulgarian. Not many of the lads understand the Scouse accent here, so when I speak English, it doesn’t really translate well – I’m going to have to pick up on my Bulgarian a bit.”</p>
      <p>Reflecting now on his 17 years at Liverpool, Randall sees only the positives of his formative years spent chasing and, however fleetingly, fulfilling the highest ambition of every Red. He cherishes what went before and relishes what lies ahead. He chooses not to dwell on what might have been.</p>
      <p>“It was big chapter in my life – it was my whole life from six years old. It was sad to go, but it was exciting to see what was next. There’s always something round the corner. That’s the good thing about football: it has its ups and downs, but there’s always something next to happen that you can work for.</p>
      <p>“Luckily I got to play for the first team, and for any Liverpool fan growing up, that’s a dream come true, something that I’ll always be proud to say I’ve done.”</p>
      <p>Randall harbours no bitterness or regret over how things ended for him at Liverpool. He remains in touch with former team-mates and members of staff at the club, and he still watches every game, tuning in twice a week from his Bulgarian hotel room to feed the fervour within him that will always burn bright red. He might have dreamed of more from the club he will always love, but he made sure never to expect it.</p>
