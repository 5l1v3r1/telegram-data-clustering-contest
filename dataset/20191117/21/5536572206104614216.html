      <p>If O.J. Simpson thinks you’ve screwed up, then you’v e truly screwed up big time.</p>
      <p>Despite being encouraged about Colin Kaepernick receiving his shot to show NFL teams what he can do, the former Buffalo Bills running back felt as if the ex-49ers QB screwed his chances to get back into the league.</p>
      <p>He noted that Kaepernick seemed angry and the fact that he changed venues in such a short amount of time that had 25 teams not showing up and only eight coming to the high school where he was.</p>
