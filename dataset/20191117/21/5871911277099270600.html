      <p>Redskins fans have had enough, and they’re now voicing their opinion about how they feel regarding the state of the team.</p>
      <p>The Redskins have the second-worst record in the league, sitting at 1-9, and getting blown out at home against the previously two-win Jets appeared to be the tipping point for them.</p>
      <p>As for the Jets, they came into FedEx Field and dominated — jumping out to a 20-3 lead at the half. Fans responded not by booing, which they’ve before in the past, but this time by chanting the following during the game.</p>
      <p>“Sell the team!” they yelled.</p>
