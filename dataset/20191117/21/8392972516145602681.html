      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!</a> were thrilled as Ant and Dec were reunited on this year's show.</p>
      <p>Ant took a year off after being arrested for drink driving and going to rehab, so he missed presenting last year's series.</p>
      <p>Holly Willoughby made the trip to Australia alongside Dec Donnelly to present in Ant's absence.</p>
      <p>But depsite the fact she was hit with fans, it was made very clear it was just temporary and Ant would be returning.</p>
      <p>And return he has.</p>

      <p>The series kicked off tonight with half of the celebs arriving on board a luxury yacht, while the other half were taken by speedboat to a beach.</p>
      <p>Viewers at home were most shocked to see Caitlyn Jenner heading into the jungle.</p>

      <p>The teams were stunned when the gang on the yacht - Nadine Coyle, Ian Wright, James Haskell, Kate Garraway, and Myles Stephenson - were told they had to swim to the beach in the clothes they were wearing to partner up with someone else.</p>
      <p>Those waiting on the beach were Caitlyn, Roman Kemp, Adele Roberts, Jacqueline Jossa, and Andrew Maxwell.</p>
