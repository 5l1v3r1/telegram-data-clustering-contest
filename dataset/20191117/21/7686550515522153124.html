        <figcaption>I'm A Celeb's Ant and Dec finally get to jungle</figcaption>

      <p>Ant and Dec broke the ice in signature style for their I'm a Celebrity reunion tonight by making a dig at Prince Andrew's Newsnight interview.</p>
      <p>The launch of the series marked the first time the duo have been in the jungle together since 2017.</p>
      <p>Last year, Dec was forced to team up with Holly Willoughby to present the popular series after Ant took time away to deal with a drink and prescription-drug addiction.</p>
      <p>But he made his return Down Under in a rather casual fashion.</p>
      <p>During Sunday's episode Ant opened the show by acknowledging: "We're back, I'm back, he's back, we're all back."</p>
      <p>Seconds later the duo also went on to make a dig at Prince Andrew's Newsnight interview by suggesting the series will make the celebrities sweat - if they can.</p>
      <p>He said: "And what a line up we've got in store for you this year.</p>
      <p>"Ten celebrities all of them very nervous, all of them sweating."</p>
      <p>Before Dec added: "Presuming they can sweat, not everyone can sweat apparently."</p>
      <p>The reference comes after the Duke of York contradicted claims he had been sweating while dancing with teenager Virginia Giuffre in Tramp nightclub - by saying a medical condition means he can't sweat.</p>
      <p>You can read the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-newsnight-17269102">full details of the interview here.</a></p>
      <p>Ant's return to I'm a Celebrity comes nearly a year after viewers at home saw his emotional return to TV during the audition stage of Britain's Got Talent.</p>

      <p>In January, stepping onto the stage, he said: "Hello everyone. Oh god, I’m really really emotional now. I’ve missed you all. As for you (pointing at Dec) I’ve missed you. Thank you very much, what a warm welcome. What a great show to come back to, I’m thrilled, I’m over the moon. Shall we move on before I cry?"</p>
      <p>In April this year, Ant was fined £86,000 and banned from driving after being caught more than double the legal drink driving limit.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old had crashed into two others cars on the other side of the road in Richmond, London, causing one child to be taken to hospital to be checked for injury.</p>
      <p>Back in November, last year Dec addressed Ant's absence with a gentle ice breaker.</p>
      <p>He said: "Good morning, good evening, welcome to Australia, where the more eagle-eyed viewers among you will have already noticed a big change to this year's show.</p>
      <p>"Yes, one of the most gorgeous presenters on British television ... has been joined by Holly Willoughby."</p>

      <p>The gentle ice-breaker was greeted with cheers from the production crew, applause, along with a curtsy and wave from Holly.</p>
      <p>This year, the full celebrity line up includes the likes of Caitlyn Jenner and former footballer Ian Wright.</p>
      <p>But for the first time, contestants will be banned from eating live bugs in Bushtucker trials, the Mirror reports.</p>
