      <h1>Age of Empires 4 won’t have any microtransactions, will get DLCs and expansions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:16:33+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:16</time> by <a rel="author">John Papadopoulos</a></address>
      <p>Age of Empires creative director, Adam Isgreen, revealed at XO19 that Age of Empires 4 will not have any microtransactions. According to Isgreen, microtransactions do not belong in a real-time strategy game. Instead, Age of Empires 4 will have DLCs and expansions.</p>
      <p>As Isgreen said:</p>
      <blockquote>“The idea of microtransactions in a real-time strategy game isn’t a thing. DLC, expansions – all of that is things that we’re going to be exploring for Age 4.”</blockquote>
      <p>The dev team will start conversions with the fans in order to figure out the content of the expansions for Age of Empires 4.</p>
      <blockquote>“While we definitely already have ideas in terms of where we want to go past Age 4, in terms of expansions and stuff, a lot of that is going to be driven by the community and the players, where they want to see the game going.”</blockquote>
