      <h2>The former Girls Aloud singer put herself at a disadvantage from the get go</h2>

      <p>Nadine Coyle won one title during the I'm A Celebrity launch on Sunday night - and it was the first star to make an awkward mistake.</p>
      <p>The popstar, 34, started her journey to the jungle aboard a lavish yacht before having to take part in an old fashioned swimming competition and she made an epic gaffe that many would be ashamed of!</p>
      <p>As she was pitted against fellow campmates Myles Stephenson, Kate Garraway, Ian Wright and James Haskell to swim to shore the beauty began on the wrong foot by swimming in the opposite direction to land.</p>
      <p>However, despite the confusion she did not place last.</p>

      <p>James and Myles arrived at the same time, although Myles marginally pipped James to the post in third was Nadine.</p>
      <p>Fourth was Ian and finally Kate managed to make it to shore without getting her hair wet.</p>
      <p>The foursome then had to select a partner from the half of the contestants and Myles won first pick and opted for Roman.</p>

      <p>Former rugby player James teamed up with Caitlyn Jenner and Nadine chose Adele Roberts and also confessed that she and the Radio 1 DJ have history as they met years prior to her shooting to fame in Girls Aloud.</p>
      <p>Ian paired up with former EastEnders actress Jacqueline Jossa and Kate made a beeline for Andrew Maxwell.</p>
      <p>The action continued as half the stars were flung into helicopters before they had to walk the plank of the The Focus Building and the other half had to do a skydive into the Australian bush before canoing through a stream.</p>

      <p>Speaking to Mirror Online earlier this week, series producer Olly Nash previewed the incredible opening episode by saying: "This is I’m A Celebrity and the contestants are going to have to be braver than ever.</p>
      <p>"The walk in itself will see us return to the plank at the Focus building. It’s the biggest and most horrendous, wobbliest thing. We tested it earlier in August and we made it deliberately more wobbly."</p>
