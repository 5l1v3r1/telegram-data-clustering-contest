      <h1>Spark New Zealand leads 5G rollout with Nokia, keeps Huawei on preferred suppliers list</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:23:23+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:23</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Spark New Zealand Ltd said on Monday it abandoned plans to rely on China’s Huawei exclusively for the rollout of 5G services but would keep it as part of a three-company preferred list of equipment suppliers.</p>
      <p>The use of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd equipment ran into a major roadblock in November 2018 when New Zealand’s intelligence agency rejected Spark’s proposal to use Huawei equipment, citing national security risks.</p>
      <p>The Chinese company has been under scrutiny over allegations and concerns that China could use Huawei’s equipment for espionage, a charge that Huawei has repeatedly denied.</p>
      <p>Spark said that Nokia, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Huawei made up its preferred list of suppliers and it would kick off its 5G rollout with Nokia – for which it has New Zealand government approval.</p>
      <p>The Auckland-based company said wireless 5G broadband would be introduced in five areas in New Zealand’s South Island before Christmas, and in major centers from mid-2020.</p>
