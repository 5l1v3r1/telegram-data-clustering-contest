      <p>Police in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> are appealing for help to trace a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/missing-people">woman missing</a> from the Drumchapel area of the city.</p>
      <p>Yvonne Ohara, 50, was last seen in the Felton Place area around 10.30 am on Sunday, 17 November.</p>
      <p>She was walking towards the Halley Flats.</p>
      <p>She is described as 5ft 6ins, with long fair hair, often worn in a ponytail and has blue eyes.</p>
      <p>When last seem, Yvonne was wearing a short, black skirt, black tights, black patent ankle boots, and a black Puffa style waist length jacked with a fur trimmed hood.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Inspector Paul Daley said: “The family of Yvonne are becoming increasing concerned about her. She left home without her phone, handbag or any money. This is completely out of character for her.</p>
      <p>“We are appealing for anyone who may have seen Yvonne to get in touch. She tends to walk everywhere rather than use public transport. If Yvonne herself reads this, then we would urge her to contact us.</p>
      <p>“If you have information that may help us to find Yvonne, please call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 1898 of Sunday, 17 November.”</p>
