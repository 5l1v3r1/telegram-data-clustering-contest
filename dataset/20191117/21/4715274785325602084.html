      <p>The Navotas City Government Tuesday conducted its 10th Business Forum to teach Navoteño entrepreneurs how to manage their wealth and succeed in their ventures.</p>
      <p>Attended by 310 owners and managers of micro, small and medium enterprises in Navotas, the forum focused on the theme, “Manage Your Wealth, Prosper Your Business.” </p>
      <p>GoNegosyo Angelpreneur Dean Pax Lapid and Rampver Financials President and Chief Executive Officer Rex Mendoza shared their insights on what values and mindsets are needed to ensure business success and sustainability.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mayor Toby Tiangco reported the achievements of the city during his first 100 days as local chief executive. </p>
      <p>“Much of what we were able to achieve was because of you. Your faithful and honest payment of taxes enabled us to implement projects and programs that are beneficial to our people, including our business community. This forum is our way of giving back to you and showing you our gratitude,” he said.</p>
      <p>Tiangco also discussed the city’s continued endeavors to address issues in housing, health, education, livelihood, and peace and order.</p>
      <p>He said the city is in the process of creating an ordinance to help housing beneficiaries with payment delinquencies. </p>
      <p>He also mentioned the ongoing construction of the Navotas City Hospital extension, the increasing number of NavotaAs scholars, and the continued services of the Navotas Vocational Training and Assessment Institute and Tulong Puhunan program.</p>
      <p>The returning mayor also explained the traffic situation at C3. He said the construction of the NLEX Harborlink Segment 10 is nearing completion; NLEX is now placing girders and crossheads. During installation, vehicles need to stop to avoid any accidents.</p>
      <p>“We cannot avoid traffic slowdowns as of now. However, once completed, the Harborlink will bring much convenience to us and lead us to more economic opportunities,” he said.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Cong. John Rey Tiangco announced that Navotas will soon have a station for ferries going to the Mall of Asia in Pasay as well as P2P buses plying Navotas-Ortigas or Navotas-Ayala routes.</p>
      <p>He also discussed the merits of the Corporate Income Tax and Incentives Rationalization Act and the Passive Income and Financial Intermediary Act, as well as the modernization of the Navotas Fish Port Complex and the construction of the Bulacan airport.</p>
      <p>“You can rest assured that together with Mayor Toby and our city council, we will do our utmost to address your needs and promote the best interests of every Navoteño,” he said.</p>
      <p>Navotas conducts the business forum every year to ensure continuous development of the business sector and build meaningful network among the city’s entrepreneurs.</p>
