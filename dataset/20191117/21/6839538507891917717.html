      <p>North Korea has dubbed Donald Trump’s presidential rival Joe Biden a “rabid dog” which needs to be put down for slandering dictator Kim Jong-un.</p>
      <p>The official KCNA news agency did not say how Mr Biden had insulted the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, but chillingly said the “time has come for him to depart his life”.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10354955/north-korea-joe-biden-rabid-dog-beaten-death/">The Sun</a> it was not immediately clear which of Mr Biden’s comments provoked North Korea’s anger.</p>
      <p>The Democrat has accused Mr Trump of cozying up to “dictators and tyrants” and has been highly critical of his summitry with Kim, calling the meetings “three made-for-TV summits”.</p>

      <p>Misspelling Mr Biden’s name, KCNA said the former vice president was showing signs of “the final stage of dementia,” and the “time has come for him to depart his life”.</p>
      <p>In a commentary, it said “such a guy had the temerity to dare slander the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK,” using the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.</p>
      <p>“It was the last-ditch efforts of the rabid dog expediting his death,” KCNA said.</p>
      <p>“Rabid dogs like Baiden (sic) can hurt lots of people if they are allowed to run about.</p>
      <p>“They must be beaten to death with a stick, before it is too late.”</p>

      <p>In contrast, the North has credited a “close personal relationship” between Kim and Mr Trump for saving ties between their countries from a destructive pattern of hostility.</p>
      <p>The leaders have met three times to discuss improving ties and ending the North’s nuclear weapons program.</p>
      <p>Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden’s presidential campaign, said: “It’s becoming more and more obvious that repugnant dictators, as well as those who admire and ‘love’ them, find Joe Biden threatening.</p>
      <p>“That’s because he’d restore American leadership in the world on day one by putting our security, interests, and values at the heart of our foreign policy.”</p>
      <p>In May North Korea’s state media has slammed Joe Biden as an imbecile, a “low IQ individual” who is “seized by ambition for power”.</p>
      <p>That came days after the former US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate slammed Kim as a “tyrant” and “dictator”.</p>

      <p>On Sunday morning local time, Mr Trump chose to retweet North Korea’s put-down of Mr Biden, saying that his opponent is “somewhat better” than a rabid hound.</p>
      <p>The tweet marked a rare — if tepid — defence of Mr Biden, even while getting in a dig at his opponent who he has always derisively called “Sleepy Joe Biden.”</p>
      <p>Whether Mr Trump was speaking sincerely or ironically in defending Mr Biden, the former vice president’s first subsequent appearance on Twitter on Sunday was hardly grateful or conciliatory.</p>
      <p>Instead, Mr Biden drew attention to Mr Trump’s pardon on Friday, local time, of a former soldier convicted of murder and a former Green Beret charged with killing a suspected Taliban bombmaker.</p>
      <p>“Trump’s intervention in the American military justice system to pardon service members accused or convicted of war crimes betrays the rule of law, the values that make our country exceptional &amp; the men and women who wear the uniform honourably,” Mr Biden posted.</p>

      <p>North Korea is known for colourful attacks on foreign leaders, with propaganda posters believed to be from the country once describing Mr Trump himself as a “mad dog”.</p>
      <p>Pyongyang also denounced Mr Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton as a “war maniac” and “human scum”.</p>

      <p>Talks between the US and North Korea onreaching a deal over North Korea’s denuclearisation have stalled after a Hanoi summit between Kim and Mr Trump broke up in February. Talks in Sweden last month also broke down.</p>
