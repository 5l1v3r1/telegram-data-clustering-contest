      <p>A raging Staten Island man stabbed his wife and then burned their house down during a wild domestic dispute Saturday night, neighbors and law enforcement told The Post.</p>
      <p>“She came to my door,” said startled Annie O’Hara, 66, who lives across the street on Monroe Avenue in St. George. “Her husband had stabbed her. She said he was setting the place on fire.”</p>
      <p>Cops have not released the couple’s names, but said the husband jumped out of a window as the house burned and was taken to a nearby hospital where he remained under police guard.</p>
      <p>He was in critical condition and had not been charged as of late Saturday night. The wife was in stable condition.</p>
      <p>Both warring husband and wife were taken to the same hospital, Richmond University Medical Center, <a href="https://www.silive.com/news/2019/11/nypd-man-stabs-wife-sets-house-on-fire-injures-self-in-tompkinsville.html">the Staten Island Advance reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Firefighters put out the blaze, but the house appeared gutted Saturday night.</p>
      <p>“She said he stabbed her in the stomach, but it wasn’t gushing,” O’Hara said of the wife, adding that the husband was stumbling in front of the home after the incident.</p>
      <p>The woman’s injuries did not appear life-threatening, O’Hara said. “She came in and had dried blood on her legs. I just had to sit her down. She was in shock.”</p>
      <p>The stunned wife begged her neighbor to call the fire department as the blaze spread and medics arrived to take her to the hospital.</p>
      <p>“She’s a very hard worker, up at 4 o’clock in the morning,” O’Hara said of the victim.</p>
