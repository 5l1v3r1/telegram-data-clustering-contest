      <h1>US brain expert backs SFA heading ban to protect footballers from dementia</h1>
      <h2>Dr Chris Nowinksi, a former WWE wrestler, says the links between repeated concussion and developing the illness are clear.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Blackstock</a></address>
      <p>A US brain expert has called for new laws that will protect young footballers from developing <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dementia">dementia</a> in later life.</p>
      <p>Dr Chris Nowinksi, a former WWE wrestler, said the links between repeated concussion and developing the illness were clear.</p>
      <p>The neuroscientist said he was satisfied the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-football-association">Scottish FA</a> will <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scotland-pioneer-ban-heading-football-20732595">ban children heading the ball </a>in an effort to protect them.</p>
      <p>But Dr Nowinski, a graduate of Harvard University who set up campaign group the Concussion Legacy Foundation, has urged authorities to also move towards legislative protection for footballers.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old, whose wrestling career ended in 2003 when he was kicked on the chin, causing post-concussion syndrome, said: “I’m thrilled the Scottish FA is acting.</p>

      <p>“I was hurt in 2003 and we started the foundation in 2007 to campaign on concussion in sports and the consequences it has.</p>
      <p>“In America, we’ve been having this national conversation since 2007.</p>
      <p>“There’s been a reluctance in football in Europe to do the same that’s been driven by three factors.</p>
      <p>“We’re talking about the most popular sport in the world.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of money in the game and you also have a global organisation running it that has credibility issues, FIFA. That all contributes to not acting.</p>
      <p>“In the US, we had hearings in Congress over the matter in 2009 and there’s been regional legislation introduced to protect players from the effects of concussion.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“If it takes laws to get protection for footballers from concussion, then make it a law.”</p>
      <p> Dr Nowinski has recruited former NFL players to leave their brains to medical research when they die to find out more about what happened to them during their careers.</p>
      <p>He added that US laws require young athletes to be trained in the signs of concussion.</p>
      <p>Players are banned from returning to the field while still suffering from the effects of the temporary condition.</p>
      <p>Dr Nowinski said the way football deals with concussed players was far behind the US.</p>
      <p>The current protocol sees games stopped for three minutes to allow assessment of suspected concussion by medical staff.</p>
      <p>He said: “The current standards to assess players in three minutes is inappropriate.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“It’s not possible to carry out an assessment in that time. In America, it’s accepted that it takes between eight and 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>“I’d like to see the current  practice trebled in football.”</p>
      <p>Last month, we told how former Watford striker George Reilly, 62, had been diagnosed with dementia when he was just 57.</p>
      <p>He said he regularly played games with concussion and had received 250 stitches to his head in knocks over his career, which he believes had contributed to developing dementia.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Government said: “We are the first country in the world to produce national <br/>guidance on dealing with concussion in sport and we are taking a range of other actions to help make sport safe.</p>
      <p>“We also welcome the commitment of the Scottish Youth Football Association and the <br/>Scottish Football Association to provide advice and take action on this issue.</p>
      <p>“We would support any measures taken, particularly for primary school-age children.”</p>
