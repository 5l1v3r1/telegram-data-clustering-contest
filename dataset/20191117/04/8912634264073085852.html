      <p>ATHENS: Five thousand police will deploy in Athens on Sunday for an annual demonstration marking the anniversary of a 1973 anti-junta uprising that regularly descends into violence, authorities say.<br/>This year the protest looks set to be dominated by opposition to the new conservative government of Kyriakos Mitsotakis, elected in July on a pledge to strengthen law and order.<br/>The demonstration marks the 46th anniversary of a student uprising at the Athens Polytechnic against the US-backed military dictatorship that ruled Greece at the time.<br/>In recent years, demonstrators have used the anniversary to voice opposition to US “imperialism,” and the harsh austerity measures imposed on Greece by international creditors after the global financial crisis.<br/>Mitsotakis’s administration has already come under fire over police operations against anarchist squats and demonstrators.<br/>There is also tension over a recent amendment to facilitate police checks in universities, which has prompted several student demonstrations.<br/>“We need to be careful these days, and (public) comments must be guarded,” the Polytechnic’s rector Andreas Bantouvas said this week.<br/>“We will be there with 5,000 officers,” police unionist Stavros Balaskas told Ellada radio.<br/>Athens mayor Kostas Bakoyannis urged respect for the city.<br/>“On this anniversary, let’s send out the right message. A shared message about memory. We should not obscure the essence which is the struggle of youth for democracy. On this anniversary, let’s show respect toward the city,” he said in a Facebook message on Friday.<br/>Throwing a Molotov cocktail — a fairly frequent occurrence at demonstrations in Greece — will now be punishable by up to 10 years in prison, instead of five years previously.<br/>“Laws and regulations are needed for Greek citizens to feel safe,” Justice Minister Kostas Tsiaras told lawmakers ahead of the vote in parliament.<br/>On Monday, some 200 students demonstrating at the Athens University of Economics were surrounded by anti-riot police who used tear gas and arrested two protesters.<br/>The anti-junta demonstration is a treasured anniversary for many Greeks, with over 10,000 people taking part last year.<br/>The bloodstained Greek flag that flew over the Polytechnic’s iron gate crushed by a tank that night is traditionally carried at the head of the demonstration in the capital.<br/>At least 24 people were killed in the 1973 military crackdown on the student uprising at the Athens Polytechnic.<br/>The event is generally considered to have broken the junta’s grip on power and helped the restoration of democracy.</p>
