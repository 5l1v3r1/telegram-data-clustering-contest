      <h1>NFL Insider Names 7 Teams In Attendance At Kaepernick Workout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:01:46+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Colin Kaepernick ended up moving his workout for the NFL from the Atlanta Falcons facility to a high school about 60 miles away in Georgia. The quarterback opened up his workout to the media and a couple of hundred fans.</p>
      <p>There were reportedly more than 24 NFL teams set to attend the workout, though that number likely decreased once the QB changed locations last minute.</p>
      <p>Still, at least seven teams were in attendance on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>CBS Sports NFL insider Jason La Canfora reports the following seven teams all had scouts on hand: Eagles, Chiefs, Skins, Jets, Titans, 49ers and Lions.</p>

      <p>Kaepernick spoke briefly to the media following the workout. He says he’s ready to go.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been ready. I’m staying ready. And I’ll continue to be ready. To all the people that came out today to support, I appreciate y’all, I love y’all. To the people that aren’t here, I’m thinking of you, I appreciate you supporting from where you are. We’ll continue to give you updates as we hear. We’ll be waiting to hear from Roger Goodell, the NFL, 32 teams. We’ll let you know if we hear from them.</p>
      <p>“The ball’s in their court. We’re ready to go,” he said in a statement.</p>

      <p>There’s about a month and a half remaining in the NFL’s regular season. It would be surprising if anyone ended up signing Kaepernick, but maybe he really impressed someone today. We’ll find out in the weeks to come.</p>
