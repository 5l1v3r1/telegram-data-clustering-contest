      <h1>Crisis-hit private prisons to return to public ownership in Scotland</h1>
      <h2>The Scottish Government move comes amid concerns over the £1.4billion contract costs for HMP Kilmanock and Addiewell.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Norman Silvester, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/norman-silvester/</a></address>
      <p>Controversial ­private <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/stalker-prison-officer-suspended-after-20572448">Scottish prisons</a> are to be brought back into public ­ownership when their contracts end.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Government move comes amid concerns over the cost to the taxpayer of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/stalker-prison-officer-suspended-after-20572448">HMP Kilmarnock</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/wife-killer-gangland-thug-prison-20730807">HMP Addiewell</a>.</p>
      <p>We can reveal the final bill will be just under £1.4billion by the end of the contracts.</p>
      <p>The £368million contract for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/young-mum-no-longer-trapped-20649398">Kilmarnock</a> , run by Serco, was awarded in 1997 and is due to expire in 2024.</p>

      <p>Addiewell’s contract began in 2006 and expires in 2034. The West Lothian jail is operated by Sodexo Justice Services. Union ­officials want the deal ­terminated early despite the Scottish ­Government being liable for a financial penalty.</p>
      <p>Kilmarnock and Addiewell were built under the Private Finance Initiative (PFI).</p>
      <p>Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf revealed the plans at a meeting with the Prison Officers Association (POA) Scotland in the Borders. Welcoming Yousaf’s plan, Andy Hogg, assistant ­general secretary of POA Scotland, said: “The cost of bringing in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/wife-killer-gangland-thug-prison-20730807">Addiewell</a> earlier would be expensive.</p>
      <p>“However that needs to be balanced with the incredible payments that have been left as an absurd legacy of the failed PFI schemes.”</p>
      <p>A Sodexo spokesman said: “Sodexo are proud to hold the 25-year contract to ­operate <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/inmates-hmp-addiewell-torch-jail-20798605">HMP Addiewell</a> and will work with the ­Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to deliver the best service we can.</p>
      <p>“We look forward to ­Kilmarnock transferring to the control of the SPS in 2024.</p>
      <p>Serco declined to ­comment.</p>

      <p>The Scottish Government said: “We have always­ ­maintained that prisons should be managed by the public sector and not run for profit by private companies.</p>
      <p>“That is why <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/inmates-hmp-addiewell-torch-jail-20798605">private ­prisons</a> will come into ­public ownership after their contracts expire.”</p>
      <p>There have been problems at both jails in recent months. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/crisis-hit-prison-boss-resigns-20848855">Addiewell</a> has been hit by staff shortages leading to a prisoner revolt in which several cell were <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/inmates-hmp-addiewell-torch-jail-20798605">set on fire.</a></p>

      <p>In August, about 60 ­prisoners <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/young-mum-no-longer-trapped-20649398">in Kilmarnock</a> were involved in ­disturbance following a drugs ­crackdown.</p>
