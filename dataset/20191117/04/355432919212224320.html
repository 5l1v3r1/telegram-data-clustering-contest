      <h1>Official testifies that Bolton had 'one-on-one meeting' with Trump over Ukraine aid</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:23:15+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rachel-frazin" target="_blank">Rachel Frazin</a></address>
      <p>Top National Security Council (NSC) official Tim Morrison testified that <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/people/john-bolton">John Bolton</a> had a private meeting in August over withheld security aid to Ukraine, according to a <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/thehill.com/homenews/house/470793-read-top-nsc-aide-tim-morrisons-closed-door-impeachment-inquiry-testimony">transcript of Morrison's testimony</a> that was released Saturday. </p>
      <p>"The President was not yet ready to approve the release of the assistance," Morrison said while discussing the Trump-Bolton conversation, which he described as a "one-on-one meeting." </p>
      <p>“The extent of my recollection is that Ambassador Bolton simply said he wasn’t ready to do it,” the NSC official added. </p>
      <p>Morrison testified late last month as part of the House's impeachment inquiry into President Trump over his dealings with Ukraine. </p>
      <p>He also told congressional investigators that ambassador to the European Union <a href="https://thehill.com/people/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a> has pressed for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/470787-house-democrats-release-pair-of-witness-transcripts-ahead-of-jam">to pursue investigations that could benefit Trump politically</a>. </p>
      <p>Bolton departed the White House in September and his name has come up in the testimony of several other impeachment inquiry witnesses.</p>
      <p>Democrats invited him to testify, but declined to subpoena him. His lawyer, Charles Cooper, recently wrote in a letter to House General Counsel Douglas Letter that Bolton knew about "many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far."</p>
      <p>One area Democrats are looking into in their investigation is whether the military assistance to Ukraine was conditioned on investigations. </p>
      <p>Trump has denied this, saying he withheld the aid because of corruption concerns and because he wanted other countries to give more money to Ukraine. </p>
