      <h1>Long-serving Tartan Army fans to get cut-price Scotland tickets thanks to Sunday Mail</h1>
      <h2>Supporters of the national team over the age of 65 will now be able to see games at Hampden for less than the normal cost.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Blackstock</a></address>
      <p>Tartan Army veterans will be offered cut-price tickets to the national team’s games thanks to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/sfas-ridiculous-ticket-pricing-strategy-20568076">Sunday Mail.</a></p>
      <p>The Scottish Football ­Association has agreed to ­reintroduce concessions to some of Scotland’s biggest matches for 20 years for fans aged over-65 ­following our ­successful ­campaign.</p>
      <p>The ­decision came after the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/sfas-ridiculous-ticket-pricing-strategy-20568076">SFA faced ­sustained criticism</a> for having withdrawn the tickets in the first place – including from leading charity Age Scotland and former first minister Henry McLeish.</p>
      <p>An SFA spokesman said: “The Sunday Mail has been passionate ­on this subject and this is a ­sensible outcome for all.” The governing body will offer ­concessions for Nations League play-off matches in March 2020.</p>
      <p>The crunch fixtures give Steve Clarke’s squad the chance to qualify for a major tournament for the first time since 1998.</p>
      <p>It is believed the new ­price structure will see pensioners given a third off tickets from March but details are still to be ironed out.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Sources say the SFA is ­considering a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/sfas-ridiculous-ticket-pricing-strategy-20568076">“bold ticket approach”</a> to ensure a packed house at Hampden for the vital play-off ties.</p>
      <p>The SFA spokesman added: ­“Concession prices will be ­available for over-65s as part of our ticketing strategy for the Euro 2020 play-offs and FIFA World Cup 2022 qualifiers.</p>
      <p>“We are thankful for the input of Age Scotland in the ­process and look forward to ­welcoming fans of all ages and ­generations to Hampden Park to help the national team ­qualify for Euro 2020 next ­summer.”</p>
      <p>Last September, we revealed the Tartan Army were angered by older fans not being able to get <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sfa-slaughtered-over-ticket-prices-20641009">cut-price entry.</a></p>
      <p>Under-16s can get tickets for as little as £8 and Age ­Scotland urged SFA leaders to overhaul their pricing.</p>
      <p>Football authorities in other countries – including the English FA – already offer cheaper entry for ­pensioners.</p>
      <p>Campaigners ­welcomed the announcement that the SFA has agreed to slash prices.</p>
      <p>McLeish, who played ­professional football with East Fife, said: “Firstly, I’d like to ­congratulate the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sfa-slaughtered-over-ticket-prices-20641009">Sunday Mail</a> on taking up this campaign and the SFA for listening.</p>
      <p>“This is an important gesture from Scotland’s football body.</p>
      <p>“The SFA needs to do all it can to get the fans back in the stands and getting behind our national team. Some of us can remember when <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sfa-slaughtered-over-ticket-prices-20641009">Hampden</a> boasted of ­attendances of 130,000. Those days won’t be repeated but the SFA needs to try all the ideas it has to get the attendance as close to full as possible.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And former first minister Lord Jack McConnell said: “Our national team needs all the ­support it can get and this is a ­welcome move from the SFA that will be cheered on by pensioners and their ­families.”</p>
      <p>Tartan Army stalwart Hamish Husband added: “This is welcome news. The Sunday Mail has ­campaigned long on this issue, backed by the fans, so this is an important victory.</p>
      <p>“There has been a lot of ­negativity around the team and the stadium in recent years so it’s good to have something to cheer about.</p>
      <p>“We need to do all we can to get young and old fans alike coming back to Scotland games.”</p>
      <p>Paul Goodwin, of the ­Scottish Football Supporters ­Association, said: “I’m delighted that the Sunday Mail has secured this important victory.</p>
      <p>“Our research has <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/ticketmaster-under-attack-pricing-tickets-20669513">shown pricing concerns</a> is one of the main reasons older fans stay away from ­Hampden.</p>
      <p>“These are largely people without a wage but have contributed ­thousands of pounds towards the game over the years.</p>
      <p>“It is only right that this audience is finally rewarded for their loyalty and patience for a lifetime of ­following the Scottish national team.”</p>
      <p>Last month, we told how the under-performing national team faced playing in front of a ­near-deserted stadium when they took on the worst team in the world San Marino.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Just over 20,000 fans turned out for Scotland’s 6-0 thumping victory at Hampden Park – where the ­capacity is nearly 52,000 – on ­October 13.</p>
      <p>The move was also welcomed from within the game.</p>
      <p>Scotland’s former women’s team captain Margaret McAulay Rae, 68, said: “This is a great thing and well done to the Sunday Mail for ­campaigning on this issue. I’d get a discount on public transport to get to Hampden so why should I pay the full price to get into the ­stadium?</p>
      <p>“A lot of fans have fallen out of love with the men’s team.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully this will help get some back to the games.”</p>
      <p>Finance experts told how the poor turnout was hitting Scottish ­football authorities in the pocket.</p>
      <p>Sports finance expert Neil Patey, of Ernst &amp; Young, said the cost of failing to sell more than half the tickets for Scotland’s five ­competitive home clashes against Belgium, Russia, Cyprus, Israel and Albania was more than ­£4million.</p>
      <p>Just 127,969 fans had turned up for those matches out of a potential 259,330 – the equivalent of just 49 per cent capacity.</p>
      <p>Commercial sales such as ­merchandise, pies and programmes were not included, so the bill was estimated to be far higher.</p>
      <p>Brian Sloan, Age Scotland’s chief executive, said: “Many older people have been loyal Tartan Army fans all their lives but struggle to afford full-price tickets on their pensions.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The SFA’s decision is a step in the right direction towards ­tackling loneliness among older people.</p>
      <p>“Around 200,000 older people in Scotland regularly go a week ­without speaking to anyone – the equivalent of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/sfa-rejects-cutting-price-oap-16166995">four full Hampden Park stadiums.</a></p>
      <p>“A more inclusive pricing ­structure means it’s easier for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/sfa-rejects-cutting-price-oap-16166995">older people</a> to enjoy a night out at a game and encourage younger fans to bring an older friend or relative.</p>
      <p>“We’d also love to see the SFA working with more community groups, such as walking sports clubs and veterans’ groups, to offer ­discounts.</p>
      <p>“This is a win-win ­situation, boosting ­attendance at matches while rewarding <br/>lifelong fans and ­reaching out to the wider ­community.”</p>
