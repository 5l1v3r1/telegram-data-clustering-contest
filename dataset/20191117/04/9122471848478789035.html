      <h1>Predicting The College Football AP Poll After Week 12 Of The 2019 Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:10:51+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>While there were some great college football games on Saturday, the biggest storyline of the day was Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa’s hip injury. Tagovailoa will be forced to miss the rest of the season – meaning his collegiate career is likely over.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen how Alabama will fare without its starting signal-caller. The Crimson Tide get rival Auburn in two weeks in a massive contest.</p>
      <p>LSU took care of Ole Miss despite a poor defensive effort, while Ohio State destroyed Rutgers. Georgia took down Auburn in their rivalry game as well.</p>
      <p>Baylor raced out to a 28-3 lead over Oklahoma only to blow it all away. The Sooners scored a huge come-from-behind road win as a result.</p>
      <p>Here’s what we think the AP Poll Top 25 will look like on Sunday afternoon:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>LSU</li>
        <li>Ohio State</li>
        <li>Clemson</li>
