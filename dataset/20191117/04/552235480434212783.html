      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Ferguson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-ferguson/</a></address>
      <p>A cash-strapped health board is paying £1715 a shift for agency nurses, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sunday-mail">Sunday Mail</a> can reveal.</p>
      <p>Figures obtained through freedom of information (FOI) laws show the astonishing sums being shelled out by<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nhs-scotland"> NHS Lothian</a> for staff.</p>
      <p>The heavily indebted board, which is at the centre of a number of financial mismanagement controversies, has admitted it is spending up to £142.95 an hour for nurses through private ­agencies.</p>
      <p>It means a staggering £1715 will be handed to private firms in exchange for providing a worker to cover a standard 12-hour shift.</p>
      <p>The nurses only receive a fraction of the payment, which would equate to a yearly salary of almost £250,000.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the cost for agency ­doctors is an eye-watering £179.70 an hour – or £2156 per 12-hour shift.</p>
      <p>Details of the shocking expenditure come after revelations that NHS Lothian has been paying £1.4million a month in PFI repayments for ­Edinburgh’s Royal Hospital for Sick Children – despite patients being ­unable to move in over safety fears.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/labour">Labour</a> MSP Neil Findlay, who requested the FOI figures, said: “NHS Lothian has the worst level of debt in Scotland.</p>
      <p>“It’s paying out £1.4million a month on fees for the sick kids’ hospital that hasn’t treated a single patient, ­waiting times are increasing and there’s a GP crisis.</p>
      <p>“In addition, we hear every day from staff who are wilting under the pressures they’re experiencing.</p>
      <p>“Now we establish they’re ­paying £1715 per day to a private agency for nurse cover, all because of the SNP Government’s complete ­failure to address staffing problems in our NHS.</p>
      <p>“The health service in Scotland is completely devolved to the Scottish Parliament.</p>
      <p>The SNP has been in power for 12 years, it cannot blame anyone else for this scandal.</p>
      <p>“We need a Government that’ll face up to the staffing problems in our health service and act now to recruit the staff to deliver the care patients need.”</p>
      <p>An Audit Scotland report revealed last month that NHS Lothian is predicted to have a deficit of £90million by 2020-21.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The sum is almost half of the total £207million forecast across all Scottish health boards and has been ­accumulating since 2009-10.</p>
      <p>The FOI figures also reveal Lothian spent £28.5million on agency staff to cover work over the last three years.</p>
      <p>One agency, the Nursing Guild, has raked in more than £6million since 2016 supplying staff to the board.</p>
      <p>NHS Lothian’s reputation has been badly damaged by the sick kids’ ­hospital scandal.</p>
      <p>The new unit was supposed to open in 2017 but has been plagued by delays and cost increases.</p>
      <p>A Scottish Government spokesman said: “The use of temporary staff allows for the continuation of vital services, ensuring patients continue to receive healthcare in their community.”</p>
      <p>Dr Tracey Gillies, NHS Lothian medical director added: “Over the last three years, we have been working to reduce the use of agency staff.”</p>
