      <h2>David Ballantine, who is standing in Edinburgh South West, also made a complaint to the police about the Koran while citing hate crime legislation.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Ferguson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-ferguson/</a></address>
      <p>Shocking footage of a Scottish <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brexit-party">Brexit Party</a> candidate calling Islam a “child rapist death cult” has been condemned by Muslim leaders.</p>
      <p>David Ballantine, who is standing in<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh"> Edinburgh</a> South West, made a series of ­troubling comments in clips on his YouTube channel.</p>
      <p>In one, he attempts to make a complaint to the police about the Koran while citing hate crime legislation.</p>
      <p>An officer tells him over the phone the holy book was written in 609 and would not be covered by the 1995 Act.</p>
      <p>In another, the former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/conservative-party">Scottish Conservative</a> candidate, who is trying to oust the SNP’s Joanna Cherry, calls Islam a “theocratically fascist system of governance”.</p>
      <p>And commenting on Labour’s London Mayor Sadiq Khan, he said: “Sadiq ‘my dad was a bus driver’ Khan doesn’t speak for the majority of people in the UK.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Those that follow a child rapist death cult, which is Islam, don’t really have a point of reference for the rest of us.”</p>
      <p>The videos also contain supportive comments about far-right convict Tommy Robinson.</p>
      <p>In one, he said: “I’m not happy that Tommy Robinson is out of jail because he should never have been in there in the first place.”</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the remarks were condemned by the Muslim Council Scotland.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: “By spreading false messages and stereotypes about Muslims and Islam, Mr Ballantine is sowing division and hatred.</p>
      <p>“Political representatives have a responsibility to represent everyone in society and not to further hate speech and intolerance.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Stuart Waiton, the Brexit Party candidate in Dundee West, has also been criticised for tweets.</p>
      <p>He referred to claims from ex-Manchester United star Patrice Evra and ex-QPR player Anton Ferdinand, who said they’d been racially abused by rivals on the pitch.</p>
      <p>A 2011 post read: “I oppose racist chanting. But it should not be illegal. Nor should players tell tales on each other about name calling.”</p>
      <p>Another, posted after the footballers had made race abuse claims, said: “What happened to the idea footballers should ‘man up’? Aka Evra and Ferdinand telling tales.”</p>
      <p>When the Sunday Mail asked Waiton about his comments, he said: “As an active anti-racist in the 80s and 90s, I have had to fight racists on the street.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“As part of a group called Workers Against Racism, we were always keen for working people to fight racism themselves rather than relying on the authorities.</p>
      <p>“The best way, in my opinion, to fight racism is to have more free speech, not less, and to have active <br/>anti-racist football crowds.”</p>
      <p>An SNP spokesman said: “It won’t surprise many people that Brexit Party candidates have extreme views – but it is extraordinary the Tories are now effectively in a pact with a party which welcomes such candidates.”</p>
