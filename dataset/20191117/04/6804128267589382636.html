      <p>Spurs face a packed fixture list when they come back from the international break.</p>
      <p>And it is sure to be make or break for their stuttering season.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino has plenty of work to do to try and save his Tottenham career.</p>
      <p>But will he be given time to do so, following five successful years at the helm?</p>
      <p>The Argentinian's future and a hint to what it holds is among our round-up of the biggest stories from the last 24 hours in and around Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <h3>Pochettino's future</h3>
      <p>Will Mauricio Pochettino be given time to turn things around at Tottenham?</p>
      <p>The manager has enjoyed five good seasons with the club, but things have unravelled this season so far.</p>

      <h3>Relegation form</h3>
      <p>Harry Redknapp knows a thing or two about guiding teams away from relegation trouble.</p>
      <p>Redknapp became something of a specialist in saving clubs during his time as a manager and he did similarly when he arrived at Spurs before taking them into the Champions League for the first time.</p>

      <h3>Tammy Abraham claim</h3>
      <p>Harry Kane took most of the plaudits on international duty with England on Thursday night.</p>
