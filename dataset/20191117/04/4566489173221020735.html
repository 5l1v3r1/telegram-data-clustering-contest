      <h1>Lebanon tycoon forgoes PM job under protest pressure</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:50:26+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:50</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Lebanon's former finance minister has backed down from becoming the protest-hit country's new prime minister, after reports of his nomination sparked ire among demonstrators railing against the ruling elite.</p>
      <p>Wealthy 75-year-old businessman Mohammed Safadi said Saturday it would be difficult to form a "harmonious" government in the country rocked by a month of unprecedented nationwide protests demanding radical reform.</p>
      <p>The tycoon said in a statement that he hoped outgoing prime minister Saad Hariri, who resigned on October 29 under pressure from the street, would be reinstated.</p>
      <p>Protesters, who see Safadi as emblematic of a corrupt and incompetent establishment, had reacted angrily on Friday to media reports that key political players had chosen him for the top job.</p>
      <p>Although there was no official confirmation of his nomination, demonstrators gathered in front of one of his properties in his hometown of Tripoli to protest against what they regarded as a provocation.</p>

      <p>It came as the US embassy in Lebanon on Saturday expressed support for the cross-sectarian protest movement that has swept the Middle Eastern country since October 17.</p>
      <p>"We support the Lebanese people in their peaceful demonstrations and expressions of national unity," the embassy said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Several mass rallies are planned for Sunday in cities across Lebanon to keep up the pressure on the country's rulers, widely seen as irretrievably corrupt and unable to deal with a deepening economic crisis.</p>
      <p>The government has stayed on in a caretaker capacity since stepping down.</p>

      <p>Some local players, notably the powerful pro-Iranian Shiite movement Hezbollah, have accused "external parties" and Western embassies of supporting the popular uprising, including through financial backing.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, a so-called "revolution bus" traversed the multi-religious country from north to south, decorated with the names of protest hotbeds.</p>
      <p>According to protesters, the initiative sought to break down geographical and sectarian barriers and overcome the collective trauma of the 1975-1990 civil war.</p>
