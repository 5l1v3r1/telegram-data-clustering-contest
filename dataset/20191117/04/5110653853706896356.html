      <h1>Week 11 Fantasy Rankings: Kicker</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:20:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:20</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>Michael Badgley and Harrison Butker are starting fantasy kickers each week no matter where or who they're playing against. But in Week 11, both get a boost that almost convinced me to slide them ahead of Justin Tucker in the Week 11 fantasy kicker rankings. The Chargers and Chiefs face off at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, where the elevation is 7,280 feet above sea level (2,000 more feet than at Mile High in Denver). Picture those long kicks that have been made in Denver through the years, and then add an extra boost to those. When you pair good kickers in what should be an offensive showdown with the potential to kick from even longer than usual, that's super appealing.</p>
      <p>If Tucker had a tougher matchup than a home game against Houston, I may have slid him out of the top spot. In reality, those three guys should all be started in every league, and you definitely aren't choosing between multiple kickers, so it's more just a fun thought exercise if that much elevation can elevate someone above Tucker. (See what I did there?)</p>

      <p>A usual member of the top three, Greg Zuerlein, is down a bit this week due to a matchup with the Bears, but that's not enough to consider sitting/dropping him in fantasy. Joey Slye (vs. Falcons), WilLutz (@ Buccaneers), and Daniel Carlson (vs. Bengals) all have matchups that should lead to plenty of points for their teams,whether that's with field goals or extra points is less certain.</p>

      <p>Further down the rankings, Stephen Hauschka could be a good play in Miami. Matt Gay should get plenty of opportunities to kick against the Saints in what promises to be a shootout. And Josh Lambo gets to kick indoors against a so-so Indianapolis defense.</p>

      <p>If there's one normally high-ranking kicker we'd feel comfortable avoiding/dropping this week, it's Philadelphia's Jake Elliott. The Patriots' defense has been proven to be mortal, but that doesn't mean the Eagles won't have some trouble moving the ball. Maybe stalled drives could mean more kicks for Elliott, but not if they stall too early or end in turnovers.</p>

      <p>The kickers that have returned from bye this week that are worth glancing at your league's free agents to see if they were dropped are (in order of preference) Ka'imi Fairbairn, Josh Lambo and Brandon McManus. The kickers with Week 11 byes are Mason Crosby, Jason Myers, Aldrick Rosas and Ryan Succop.</p>
