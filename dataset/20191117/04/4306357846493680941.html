      <h3>Glenn Hoddle is backing Reece James to develop into a top player for Chelsea FC in the coming seasons.</h3>
      <p>The 19-year-old made his first Premier League start of the season last weekend when he played the full 90 minutes in Chelsea FC’s 2-0 win over Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>James has impressed whenever called upon by Frank Lampard this season, with the young full-back having made a total of nine appearances for the Blues, and scoring two goals.</p>
      <p>The youngster was in good form as he helped Chelsea FC to keep a clean sheet against the Eagles last weekend as the Blues made it six wins in a row in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>And former England boss Hoddle believes that the young full-back has a bright future at the west London club.</p>
      <p>Speaking during <i>BT Sport</i>‘s coverage of the game, Hoddle said: “What’s impressive about Reece James is that he’s got a lovely frame for a full-back. He’s not going to get bullied.</p>
      <p>“He’s a decent defender and certainly can get himself forward and use the ball.</p>
      <p>“It’s really good so he’s got a bright future, he really has.”</p>
      <p>James will be hoping to be involved when the Blues return to Premier League action after the international break with a trip to Manchester City.</p>
      <p>The west London side are currently third in the Premier League table and eight points behind leaders Liverpool FC after 12 games of the new campaign.</p>
