      <h1>Whistleblower Police Scotland officer gagged over corruption claims</h1>
      <h2>Robert Brown wanted to show documents at public hearing but Lord Advocate has ruled the hearing must now be heard in private.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Gordan Blackstock</a></address>
      <p>Scotland’s top prosecutor has won a battle to gag a former police officer from airing corruption claims.</p>
      <p>Former PC Robert Brown, who retired last month, has been trying to make documents public at an employment tribunal.</p>
      <p>He hoped to make a dossier running to dozens of pages public.</p>
      <p>Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">Police Scotland</a>’s legal team argued the documents should be banned from being disclosed.</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> tribunal judge Muriel Robison has sided with Wolffe’s “public interest” request.</p>
      <p>It is believed to be the first time a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/justice">Lord Advocate</a> has “taken a public interest objection to the recovery, inspection or use of documents”.</p>

      <p>The hearing, due to go ahead next year, will now be held in private.</p>
      <p>Any final judgment will also be passed to the Lord Advocate to see before it is published.</p>
      <p>It was reported earlier this year that the Lord Advocate argued it would be “against the public interest including in safeguarding the integrity and effectiveness of the system for detecting, investigating and prosecuting crime” if the documents were disclosed.</p>
      <p>As well as being head of the Crown Office, Wolffe is a Government minister.</p>
      <p>Brown, who retired after 30 years’ service based in Lanarkshire, has been involved in an employment tribunal with Police Scotland since 2014.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In September, we told how Brown, 48, used social media to accuse Chief Constable Iain Livingstone of failing to act on information he was given.</p>
      <p>Other claims from police staff include disputes over race, age, sex and disability discrimination.</p>
      <p>Four claims were settled out of court before going to a tribunal and a further five officers and staff settled after full hearings began.</p>
      <p>Six cases saw police employees asked to sign so-called “gagging orders” or non-disclosure agreements.</p>
      <p>Brown did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service declined to comment.</p>
