      <h1>Predicting The Top 10 Of The Third College Football Playoff Rankings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:11:10+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Saturday’s college football slate featured some great games, but it also featured some unfortunate injuries. Alabama star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffered a dislocated hip that will require surgery and likely end his college career.</p>
      <p>Alabama still handled Mississippi State, but there’s no doubt that the Crimson Tide won’t be the same team moving forward without Tagovailoa. It’ll be fascinating to see how the College Football Playoff committee handles Tagovailoa’s injury when it assesses the Crimson Tide.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, LSU outlasted Ole Miss while looking shaky on defense, Ohio State blew out Rutgers, Georgia held off Auburn and Baylor got out to a huge lead and gave it all up in a tough loss to Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>Minnesota, which shot up to No. 8 after the Penn State win, also lost to Iowa.</p>
      <p>Here’s what we think the top 10 of the third version of the College Football Playoff Rankings will look like:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>LSU</li>
        <li>Ohio State</li>
        <li>Clemson</li>
        <li>Georgia</li>
        <li>Alabama</li>
        <li>Oregon (plays Arizona late tonight)</li>
        <li>Utah</li>
        <li>Oklahoma</li>
        <li>Penn State</li>
        <li>Florida</li>
      </ol>
      <p>College football fans – do we have it right?</p>
