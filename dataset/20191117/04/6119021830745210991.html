      <p>At least 18 civilians were killed and 27 others suffered injuries in a car bomb attack on Saturday in the Syrian city of al-Bab, according to Turkish Defence Ministry.</p>
      <p>Though the Ministry had earlier in a Twitter post said the attack on a bus terminal killed ten and wounded more than 15 others, Al Jazeera reported that Turkish media, citing defence ministry gave a higher death toll later.</p>
      <p>It also quoted Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor as saying that 19 people had died in the blast.</p>
      <p>Turkey has blamed Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) for the attack. Turkey's Defence Ministry wrote on Twitter that YPG "terrorists" detonated a car bomb in the al-Bab bus terminal.</p>
      <p>"Inhumane and uncivilized PKK/YPG terrorists continue to target innocent civilians using the same methods as Isla. This time the terrorists detonated a car bomb in the Al-Bab bus terminal in the Op Euphrates Shield area, killing 10 civilians and injuring more than 15," the ministry tweeted.</p>
      <p>Last week, at least eight people were killed and more than 20 sustained injuries after a car explosion rocked the village of Suluk in the north of the Syrian Raqqa Governorate.</p>
