      <h1>Celine Dion’s Courage Is A Legacy Of Love Fulfilled, Living Life, And Being Brave Enough To Love Again</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:17:22+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:17</time> by <a rel="author">Charisse Van Horn</a></address>
      <p>Celine Dion’s new album <i>Courage</i> is an album that needed to be made — not just for her as she finds hope in life and love following the death of her husband of 22-years René Angélil, but also for those who are going through their own grief. Music heals and while<i> Courage</i> may have been a therapeutic journey for Celine as it is the first English album she’s released in six years, it is an album that will heal others as well.  René Angélil passed away on January 14, 2016, and for the first time, Celine was left on her own. As René Angélil had been her manager for her entire career, Celine was left in a vulnerable position, not just emotionally, but professionally as well.</p>
      <p>The only thing that might bring comfort to someone who is grieving is pouring out their heart to someone who is also grieving and understands his or her pain. <i>Courage</i> is that album for the countless who find themselves suddenly without their partner, standing on their own (sometimes for the first time) and learning how to live when the script you and your partner wrote is suddenly ripped to shreds and there’s nothing else to do but start over.</p>
      <p>But <i>Courage</i> is not an album that is so full of loss, grief, and sorrow that is morose. Celine has woven songs into the track set that bring encouragement as well as healing with power ballads, EDM tracks, and at times you’ll feel like dancing.</p>
      <p>There is the knowledge that loved ones want those left behind to move forward with their lives, and that their love may be gone but it’s never over. The greatest way to honor those who have passed is to live a life of courage and that means being brave enough to love and live for those entrusted to our care.</p>
      <p><i>Courage</i> is an album that will not only help those who are grieving but will inspire them to move forward in life and continue to live life to the fullest and that means embracing love again.</p>

      <p>Vocally, Celine is on point as always. She has worked with incredible artists, producers, and writers on the album. You might be surprised to see some of the biggest names in music today who worked with Celine on the album such as Sia, Sam Smith, Skylar Grey, DJ Khalil, David Guetta and more.</p>
      <p>Though technically, the album is flawless and Celine’s vocals are as strong as they ever were and might be more impassioned,  it is the lyrical content that will endear <i>Courage</i> to those who find themselves at a place in life when they need a push to get up, start over, and embrace life with strength, bravery, and courage.</p>
      <p>Celine’s 12th album <i>Courage</i> is that push — not only for herself but for others too.</p>
