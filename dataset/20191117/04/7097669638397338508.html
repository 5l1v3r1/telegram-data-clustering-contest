      <h1>Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards Defies Trump Opposition to Win Re-Election in Louisiana</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:01:46+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/" target="_blank">Allison Quinn</a></address>
      <p>Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, has won re-election in the state’s runoff election, defeating Republican challenger Eddie Rispone and fending off an effort by President Trump to turn the office red. </p>
      <p>The Associated Press announced Edwards’ narrow victory a few hours after the polls closed, and several local news outlets <a href="https://twitter.com/KPLC7News/status/1195914953452138496">reported</a> that Rispone had called Edwards to <a href="https://twitter.com/WAFB/status/1195913746952130560">concede</a>.</p>
      <p>Edwards thanked supporters at a victory rally late Saturday where he appeared to acknowledge Trump’s presence in the race, saying, “And as for the president, God bless his heart.”</p>
      <p>Rispone, after his loss, reportedly urged his supporters to give Trump a round of applause, saying, “That man loves America and he loves Louisiana.”</p>
      <p>Rispone’s defeat came just hours after Trump threw <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1195844715238830082">one last endorsement </a>his way before the polls closed.</p>
      <p>The race was widely seen as a test of Trump’s own popularity amid an impeachment inquiry against him. </p>
      <p>It may have been Rispone who appeared on the ballot as the challenger to the incumbent Edwards, but Trump injected himself into the race and made clear to Louisiana voters that a loss for Rispone would be felt very personally by the president. Rispone was even described as “pro-Trump” on some of his campaign flyers. </p>

      </p>
      <p>“I really need you … to send a message to the corrupt Democrats in Washington,” Trump told voters at a rally in Bossier City on Thursday, urging the crowd to “fire your far-left governor.” </p>
      <p>It was Trump’s third visit to Louisiana in a month to rally voters against Edwards, the only Democratic governor in the Deep South. </p>
      <p>“So you’ve gotta give me a big win, please. OK?” Trump said. </p>
      <p>His plea sounded strikingly similar to remarks he made to voters in Kentucky ahead of the state’s <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/kentucky-gubernatorial-election-not-even-trump-could-save-matt-bevin">gubernatorial race</a> earlier this month, when he said a vote for the Democratic candidate over the incumbent Republican he was backing would send a “really bad message” and “you can’t let that happen to me.”</p>
      <p>It just so happened that Trump’s appeal to voters in Louisiana came just hours after that same Kentucky Republican he’d endorsed <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/matt-bevin-concedes-to-andy-beshear-in-kentucky-governors-race">conceded defeat</a>.</p>
