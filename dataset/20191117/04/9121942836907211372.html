      <p>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — The Afghan election commission has tried to launch another ballot recount but presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah halted the attempt by saying he won’t let his observers participate.</p>
      <p>The September election has been mired in controversy. The election commission has tried to carry out a ballot recount. Both President Ashraf Ghani and his main rival and chief executive in the current government, Abdullah, were running for president.</p>
      <p>Afghan election laws call for representatives of all presidential candidates to observe ballot counting.</p>
      <p>Abdullah said on Sunday that the commission needs to stop trying to do a recount, contending many of the ballots are fake.</p>
      <p>His announcement halted the process so it’s unclear what happens next. Abdullah had halted the process once earlier, when he pulled his observers from the recount last week.</p>
