        <b>Red Deer Rebels 4 – 3 Brandon Wheat Kings</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Red Deer Rebels (6-11-0-3) were looking for some bounces to go their way after a hard-played game against the Medicine Hat Tigers resulted in a disappointing 4-3 shootout loss.</p>
      <p>The bounces would have to go there way against a Brandon Wheat Kings (9-12-0-0) team that was riding high after a 7-2 win over the Winnipeg Ice.</p>
      <p>Despite some late hiccups, the Rebels would ride an impressive three-goal first period on the way to a 4-3 win.</p>
      <p>“It was similar to last night, the only thing tonight is that we had a good enough lead going into the third,” Coach Brent Sutter said.</p>
      <p>The second of four meetings between the two squads would be all Red Deer in the first period, with the home team jumping out to a 3-0 lead.</p>
      <p>Arshdeep Bains would open up the scoring on a tipped Christoffer Sedoff shot; Dawson Barteaux score a powerplay goal from the point for the second; and Ethan Rowland would make a great driving play to goal off the face-off to put his team up three.</p>
      <p>Bains said his line has been clicking well.</p>
      <p>“We all complement each other well and we all work together. There is no selfishness and we move pucks,” Bains said.</p>
      <p>The second saw Red Deer maintain their three-goal lead but Brandon would get on the board to make it 4-1.</p>
      <p>Red Deer native Josh Tarzwell would score on a nifty back-hand rebound, but Wheat King Ben McCartney had the answer later in the period, scoring a powerplay to keep the game theoretically in reach.</p>
      <p>“We started taking penalties and it took the momentum away from us,” Sutter said.</p>
      <p>Brandon would make it interesting in the third but a flurry of saves by Rebels netminder Byron Fancy would save the game for the Rebels.</p>
      <p>“I thought we all played really well tonight but our third periods still need to be better. Right now we are a 40 minute team but if we just keep working on it, I don’t doubt we will keep getting better,” Bains said.</p>
      <p>Cole Reinhardt would score two for the Wheat Kings — one of them on a 6-on-5 man advantage to put his team within one with under two minutes to play, but it wouldn’t be enough.</p>
      <p>“We’ll take the points tonight. Every point is big,” Sutter said.</p>
      <p>Fancy picked up the win, stopping 37 shots for Red Deer; while Jiri Patera stopped 21 in the loss.</p>
      <p>“He (Fancy) has been working his butt off. He is ready to be a player in this league and he’s earned it. He has been playing great,” Fancy said.</p>
      <p>The Rebels remain at home to take on Prince Albert on Nov. 20, followed by another home game next weekend on Nov. 23 against Lethbridge.</p>
