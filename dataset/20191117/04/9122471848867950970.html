      <h1>CeeDee Lamb Tweets Message For Oklahoma Fans After Crazy Win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:36:23+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Oklahoma was without star wide receiver CeeDee Lamb on Saturday night, but the Sooners’ offense was able to pull off a crazy comeback anyway. Lincoln Riley’s team rallied from a 21-point halftime deficit to take down Baylor in Waco.</p>
      <p>Lamb, who didn’t play after missing practice with an unspecified injury, was in street clothes on the sideline during OU’s 34-31 win.</p>
      <p>The star wide receiver took to Twitter following the game.</p>
      <p>“This team I’m grateful for! SOONER NATION THANK YOU! Now let’s work sum more!!!!” he wrote.</p>

      <p>Lamb went through pregame warmups at Baylor, but ultimately didn’t play.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma was able to pull off a 25-point comeback without him, as the Sooners dominated the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Jalen Hurts and Co. improved to 9-1 with the win, staying in the College Football Playoff hunt. Hopefully for the Sooners, Lamb gets back on the field soon.</p>
