      <h1>Man City told to sign Kalidou Koulibaly and Milan Skriniar to keep pace with Liverpool</h1>
      <h2>Pep Guardiola's side are currently nine points behind the Premier League leaders</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:45:50+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:45</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City must improve their defence by signing a top class centre-back like Kalidou Koulibaly or Milan Skriniar if they want to keep pace with Premier League leaders <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , according to Jason McAteer.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's side lost further ground to the Reds in the title race after they were beaten 3-1 at Anfield before the international break.</p>
      <p>The defending champions are currently fourth in the table - nine points behind Jurgen Klopp's side - with questions raised over the quality of the back four in the early stages of the campaign.</p>
      <p>After failing to sign a replacement for Vincent Kompany during the summer, they suffered the added blow of losing star centre-back Aymeric Laporte to a serious knee injury in August.</p>
      <p>And although he admitted that City should not be discounted from the title race, former Liverpool midfielder McAteer said that Guardiola should aim to improve his options at the back to give his side the best chance of staying competitive.</p>

      <p>Writing in his column for the <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/sport/saturday-columns/jason-mcateer-ireland-need-a-special-performance-to-see-off-clever-denmark/409323">Racing Post</a> , McAteer said: "You might think that Joe Gomez and his Liverpool team-mates have got one hand on the Premier League title after last week’s outstanding victory over <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , but that’s a dangerous claim to make.</p>
      <p>"City are a side who tend to bounce back from setbacks by going on unbelievable winning runs and they could make that nine-point lead look fragile if they get going.</p>
      <p>"Yes, they have issues at the back which need addressing and they need to get to the start of the January transfer window without losing any ground, then perhaps Pep will go in for another centre-back.</p>

      <p>"It looks as though he might have no choice with Aymeric Laporte sidelined until at least February and Fernandinho being found out. I’m just not sure Nicolas Otamendi and John Stones are good enough.</p>
      <p>"I’m a big fan of Kalidou Koulibaly at Napoli but then so are a lot of people so he would cost serious money. Maybe Pep should have a look at someone such as Milan Skriniar at Inter, who is winning plaudits.</p>
      <p>"He’s got to do something because if you’re a City fan you’re thinking this defence isn’t good enough to stay competitive over a busy winter."</p>
      <p>City will host third-placed <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> at the Etihad Stadium next weekend in their first game after the international break.</p>
