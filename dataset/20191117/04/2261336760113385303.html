      <p>The UFC Sao Paulo main event just wrapped up with the promotion’s #6 ranked light heavyweight, Jan Blachowicz, edging out the company’s #8 ranked middleweight Ronaldo Souza with a split decision. Blachowicz has now won six of his last seven, and called for a title shot in his post-fight interview.</p>
      <p>Jacare closed the distance right away, shoving Blachowicz against the fence. Blachowicz was able to skirt away into open space, but it wasn’t long before Jacare closed the distance again. They stalled out against the fence, with each man landing short knees to the body. The second act looked a lot like the first one. Not a lot happened in open space, with a lot of the round taking place against the cage. Jacare was able to close the distance and keep Blachowicz’s back to the fence.</p>
      <p>Blachowicz started landing more on the feet in the third round. He was able to get off of the cage a lot easier than he did in the previous rounds. Jacare landed a few strikes here and there, but the volume was on the side of Blachowicz. The left foot of Blachowicz started to swell really bad in the fourth frame. Not a ton of wow moments happened in this frame. Jacare closed the distance yet again and stalled out against the cage. In open space, the fighters were hesitantly throwing solo strikes.</p>
      <p>The final round looked a lot like the rest of the fight, until the end of the round. Jacare tried to close the distance but ate an uppercut in the process. Then, Blachowicz landed a flurry that seemed to drop the Brazilian, but it might have been a slip. That was about the most exciting part of the entire fight.</p>
