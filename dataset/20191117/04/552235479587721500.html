      <p>A mum of six who <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/drunken-thug-caged-after-stabbing-20887680">murdered</a> two of her children is being given parenting classes behind bars.</p>
      <p>Sarah Barrass will be taught how to be a better mother even though she is just beginning a minimum 35-year sentence for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/body-25-year-old-woman-20895334">murdering</a> sons Tristan, 13, and Blake, 14.</p>
      <p>Barrass, 35 – in the same prison as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/serial-killers-rose-west-myra-20651910">mass killer Rosemary West</a> – was jailed last week along with her half-brother Brandon Machin, 39, who got the same sentence.</p>
      <p>The incestuous couple’s surviving children are now in care.</p>
      <p>A source said: “They will have no contact with her unless they choose to do so as adults. But part of her re-education and learning will be modules designed to show her where she went wrong as a parent.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Barrass and Machin ­strangled their sons in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/oli-mcburnie-makes-instant-impact-18889924">Sheffield</a> in May – the day after a plot to poison all six of their kids had failed.</p>
      <p>The couple, who have the same mother, had been in a sexual relationship since their teens.</p>
      <p>They claimed they decided to kill their children after fearing they would be found out by the authorities and the youngsters taken into care.</p>
      <p>Social services had been in contact with the family since 1990.</p>
      <p>Barrass is being held in the maximum security New Hall women’s jail near Wakefield, Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>Sheffield City Council has launched a serious case review.</p>
