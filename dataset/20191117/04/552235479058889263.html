      <h2>Nicola Stevenson claimed she had been pushed out of a fourth-floor window by a man and shot at.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Norman Silvester, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/norman-silvester/</a></address>
      <p>A woman who was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/body-scots-mum-two-found-20891114">stuffed inside a wheelie bin told friends</a> she’d been threatened before she was found dead.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/body-scots-mum-two-found-20891114">Nicola Stevenson</a> claimed she had been pushed out of a fourth-floor window by a man, who she also claimed shot her.</p>
      <p>She also said her car and property had been vandalised last year.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old, of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/bradley-welsh-murder-cops-cordon-16213929">Balerno, Edinburgh</a> , was discovered inside a refuse bin four days ago in Lewes, Sussex. Police believe the mum of two had been there for more than two weeks.</p>
      <p>Nicola, who was a regular user of social media, had not logged on to Facebook since October 9 – when officers believe she went missing.</p>
      <p>She wrote on her page that she’d been thrown out of a window and shot in July.</p>
      <p>In April, she also claimed: “Just thought I should put this online to warn all women in the south east to be careful of a man who assaulted me.</p>
      <p>“Have just found out that our great justice system has done no further action.</p>
      <p>“If you want to find out more I’m willing to message who it is to save him hurting anyone else.”</p>

      <p>In March, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/body-scots-mum-two-found-20891114">Nicola also claimed police were using dogs</a> to locate a man who was banned from approaching her. She told of someone trying to “destroy” her home and motability vehicle in August 2018.</p>
      <p>Two men aged 41 and 37 are being held by police on suspicion of Nicola’s murder.</p>
      <p>Forensic teams yesterday continued to search the spot where her body was found by a dog walker on Wednesday lunchtime, and also her nearby home.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/body-scots-mum-two-found-20891114">Nicola was a recovering cancer patient</a> and used an adapted scooter to get about. She claimed to suffer from Russell-Silver syndrome – a condition which can lead to stunted growth and facial problems.</p>
      <p>Lib Dem councillor Janet Baah, a member of Lewes Town Council, said the community was stunned by Nicola’s death.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She said: “The fact she was dead for such a long time and no one knew that she was in a bin is shocking. This is a very peaceful law abiding town and I do not know how we can recover from it. It really is terrible.”</p>
      <p>Sussex Police Detective Chief Inspector Chris Friday said: “Nicola died following a significant blow to the head.</p>
      <p>"Her body had been placed in the wheelie bin and dumped in undergrowth and we want to establish when that happened. We know the bin was probably there on November 1 and we are trying to establish when Nicola was last seen alive.”</p>
