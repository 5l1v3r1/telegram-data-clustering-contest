      <h1>UFC Sao Paulo results: Jan Blachowicz edges Ronaldo Souza by split decision, calls out Jon Jones</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:52:22+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:52</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Lelinwalla</a></address>
      <p>Ronaldo Souza rushed in for a takedown attempt and Jan Blachowicz made him pay with an uppercutfollowed by a flurry of punches that made the Brazilian taste the canvas in the fifth and final round of their bout Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The late offense, the most significant shots of the bout, paved the way for Blachowicz to eke out an ultra-close split-decision victory in the low-action main event of UFC Sao Paulo at the Ginasio do Ibirapuera. Two judges scored it 48-47 in favor of the Polish fighter and the other judge had it 48-47 for Souza.</p>
      <p>Blachowicz called out UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones following the victory.</p>

      <p>"Jon, let's do this," Blachowicz said. "Give me the title shot because I don’t have time. Maybe three more years and I go to retire. So, now or never."</p>

      <p>Jones is down on the entire light heavyweight division andBlachowicz didn't do anything to excite him Saturday night, but one can't blameBlachowicz for taking his shot.</p>
      <p>Souza negated Blachowicz’s six-inch reach advantage by getting inside and grappling his opponent up against the Octagon over many sequences, drawing boos from the Brazil crowd at times.</p>
      <p>"Jacare"also put Blachowicz on notice about his power in the second round when he drove him back with a stiff right hand. During the waning seconds of the third, Souza landed a hard right across Blachowicz’s chin, but Blachowiczreturned fire with a short combination.</p>
      <p>Blachowicz was laboring on swollen feet and looked destined to be edged on the scorecardsbefore connecting on that uppercut and dropping Souza in Round 5.</p>
      <h3>Mauricio Rua, Paul Craig fight to split draw; light heavyweights</h3>
      <p>Craig greeted Rua with a spinning wheel kick and then caught the Brazilian lacking moments lateras he pummeled him against the Octagon with hard lefts and rights. That prompted the referee to take a closer look, but the MMA legend held his guard up high, absorbed the punishment and survived the opening-round scare.</p>

      <p>The rocky start sparked Rua, who turnedthe tide in the second and third rounds. He spent much of those frames in top control and using a dominant ground-and-pound. Although it felt as though Rua did enough to squeak past Craig, judges saw it even, scoring it 29-28 for Rua, 29-28 for Craig and 28-28.</p>

      <p>For what it’s worth, Rua’s face looked battered. The result marked the first career draw for both fighters.</p>
      <h3>Charles Oliveira blasts Jared Gordon in first-round KO (punches); lightweights</h3>
      <p>Oliveira dropped Gordon with a picture-perfect right hook, spun him around and finished him with a right uppercut.</p>

      <p>Just like that, the UFC’s all-time leader in submission victories proved he can also finish things on his feet.</p>
      <p>The Sao Paulo native then called out Conor McGregor.</p>
