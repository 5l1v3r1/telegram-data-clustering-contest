      <h1>Forced marriages and honour killings on the rise in Scotland’s ethnic communities</h1>
      <h2>Police and women’s support agencies have seen a surge in the number of cases in the past four years.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Norman Silvester, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/norman-silvester/</a></address>
      <p>Forced marriages and so-called <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/domestic-violence">honour-based violence</a> are on the rise in Scotland’s ethnic communities, new statistics reveal.</p>
      <p>Police and women’s support agencies have seen a surge in the number of cases in the last four years.</p>
      <p>Official figures show that the number of forced marriages recorded – including girls as young as 14 – jumped from 40 in 2015 to 53 last year.</p>
      <p>Honour-based violence against women rose from 104 cases four years ago to 131 incidents in 2018.</p>
      <p>Girijamba Polubothu, of Shakti Women’s Aid in ­<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, explained that the charity is regularly contacted by girls who fear they will be forced into marriage when they turn 16.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She said: “The figures do not ­surprise me. The problem is under-reported. In the last year, we helped 23 women  who were victims of forced ­marriage.</p>
      <p>Some were under 16.</p>
      <p>“We’re helping nine people aged between 15 and 19 and several girls aged 14.</p>
      <p>“Victims of forced marriage often have disabilities and mental health problems.”</p>
      <p>In 2017, Shakti helped 533 women who were victims of domestic abuse including honour-based violence.</p>
      <p>Victims are mainly female and come from Asia, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/middle-east">Middle East</a>, Far East, and Africa although some are also born in the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>Girijamba said: “The grooming for forced marriage can begin in childhood.</p>
      <p>Girls are normally taken abroad to marry, when 16 or 17.</p>

      <p>“They’re then presented with a man, or a few men and asked to select who they want to marry. It looks like there’s a choice but there isn’t.</p>
      <p>Often victims are meeting their husbands for the first time.”</p>
      <p>Shakti helps women affected by forced marriage and honour-based violence abuse in Edinburgh, Dundee, the Forth Valley and Fife.</p>
      <p>Police and social services are automatically told of cases ­involving under-age girls.</p>
      <p>Dr Marsha Scott, chief ­executive of Scottish Women Aid said: “The figures we have on this issue are the tip of the iceberg.</p>
      <p>“Many honour-based abuse victims are vulnerable.</p>
      <p>“They’re often poor, English is not their first language and they can’t access benefits or housing.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“It’s difficult to for them to find help. This is happening all over Scotland.”</p>
      <p>Scottish Women’s Aid is ­carrying out lectures across the country to police officers, ­teachers, social workers and healthcare experts to tell them about the growing problem.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Debra ­Forrester said: “If you or someone you know is in a forced marriage, or living in fear of being forced to marry, then the law is there to protect you.</p>
      <p>“Honour-based abuse is a violation of human rights and has no justification.</p>
      <p>“We take all reports seriously.”</p>
