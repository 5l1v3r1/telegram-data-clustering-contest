      <p>Billy Connolly says he wants to find a bed that throws him out in the morning.</p>
      <p>The comedy legend said he’d love to find an alarm clock similar to one created by his hero – Dunbar-born naturalist John Muir.</p>
      <p>Muir’s work included a device that was hooked to a bed which would flip up whenever it went off.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/billy-connolly">Billy</a>, 77, who is battling Parkinson’s disease which causes muscle stiffness, believes his start to the day would be easier if he could find one.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/the-baftas">Bafta winner</a> was first diagnosed with the progressive neurological condition six years ago.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a>-born Billy – who now lives in Florida – said: “Muir handmade these alarm clocks, big pieces of furniture that woke you in the morning and flung you out of bed.</p>
      <p>“I could have it beside my bed, with a chute you slide down a Sleepy Wheecher.”</p>
      <p>Muir – best remembered as the founder of the American Great Parks – devised his “early rising machine” to help set him on his feet.</p>
      <p>Speaking of his admiration for Muir, Connolly said: “He was way ahead of his time.”</p>
