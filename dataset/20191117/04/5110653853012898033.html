      <h1>Week 11 Fantasy RB Rankings: David Johnson continues falling, Derrius Guice returns</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:23:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:23</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Lutovsky</a></address>
      <p>The byes hit our Week 11 fantasy RB rankings hard, taking Saquon Barkley, Aaron Jones, Jamaal Williams, Chris Carson, and Derrick Henry from fantasy owners. That's four RB1s and a solid RB2. James Conner and Devonta Freeman (and likely a few others) figure to be "questionable", at best, and several committee backs face tough matchups. All of this is making viable starters tough to find, as injury replacements only go so far. The good news? Kalen Ballage is available on most waiver wires, so...</p>
      <p>OK, that's not really good news. Ballage did have 20 carries last week and has a favorable matchup (vs. Bills) in Week 11, so he actually is worth playing, but the definition of two-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust likely isn't going to make or break your week. That type of impact -- at least the "break" part -- will come from guys like David Johnson (@ 49ers), Jordan Howard (vs. Patriots), Sony Michel (@ Eagles), and Philip Lindsay (@ Vikings). Those committee backs (yes, David Johnson is a committee back) have tough matchups and might be extra touchdown dependent. Lindsay has a little more upside because of his receiving ability, which would also be true of Johnson if he looked healthy...at all.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Fantasy owners are also understandably worried about Alvin Kamara (@ TB) after his no-show in Week 10. A matchup against Tampa doesn't figure to help his cause, but at least he looked healthy last week. He remains a high-end RB2 in our rankings, but obviously more touches will be needed.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It's not all bad news for RBs. The Chargers (vs. Chiefs in Mexico) and Bills (@ Dolphins) committees have favorable matchups, giving us at least three viable starters. Derrius Guice (vs. Jets) is expected to return from a knee injury that's kept him out almost all season, though a tough matchup and the presence of Adrian Peterson dims our excitement there.</p>

      <p>Kareem Hunt (vs. Steelers) looked good with 11 touches in his season debut, often playing alongside Nick Chubb. If the Browns can keep finding creative ways to get Hunt the ball, he'll be a FLEX most weeks. Brian Hill (@ Panthers) is also in a good spot even if Freeman does play, as he should see half the RB touches in a highly favorable matchup. (<i>Update: Freeman is not expected to play.)</i></p>

      <p>Last week felt like a down one for RBs, and the outlook for this one is the same. It might be one of those weeks where going with a "high-floor" option is your best bet. There will be some big runs and cheap touchdowns, so swinging for the fences is never a bad strategy either, but clearly big days will be tough to come by.</p>
