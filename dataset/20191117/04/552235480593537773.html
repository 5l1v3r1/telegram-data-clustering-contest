      <h1>Le Mans 66 put in shade by tiny team of Scots who stunned motorsport</h1>
      <h2>Ecurie Ecosse shook the world of racing in 1956 as the Edinburgh team defeated motoring giants Ferrari, Aston Martin and Jaguar.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Brian McIver, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/brian-mciver/</a></address>
      <p>It’s a high-octane world of fast cars and fearless drivers racing round the clock at breakneck speed for one of the world’s most prestigious prizes in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motoring-news">motor sport</a>.</p>
      <p>Le Mans 66 hits cinemas this weekend and tells the story of how two men tried to end <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ferrari">Ferrari</a>’s stranglehold on the 24-hour race.</p>
      <p>Christian Bale and Matt Damon star as British racing driver Ken Miles and US car designer Carroll Shelby, who work with Ford Motor Company and build a revolutionary racing car to challenge the Italian racing giant.</p>
      <p>But even better is the story of Le Mans ’56 – and the Scots who did it all a decade before the Americans.</p>

      <p>That was when Ecurie Ecosse, run out of a tiny backstreet garage in the middle of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, shook the world of racing, twice defeating the giants of Ferrari, Aston Martin and Jaguar 10 years before the exploits of Shelby and Miles.</p>
      <p>Because, while the Ford vs Ferrari movie is billed as an underdog contest, as the US car makers struggled to defeat the Italian stallions, the exploits of the Scots team were founded on the work ethic of an Edinburgh accountant and his pals from a tiny garage in Merchiston Mews.</p>

      <p>Businessman David Murray set up Ecurie Ecosse in 1951, with a foreign-sounding name because there was more chance of lucrative sponsorhips and a team of mechanics and engineers working hard to gain tiny advantages over the big guns.</p>
      <p>Within five years, they had made history by winning Le Mans and then repeated it the next year, launching a sporting legacy that has influenced just about every Scots racing superstar, from Sir Jackie Stewart and David Coulthard to Allan McNish and Dario Franchitti, all of whom have raced for the Ecurie name.</p>
      <p>Current team boss Alasdair McCaig said it’s a story that everyone in Scotland should be proud of.</p>
      <p>He said: “For the past 60 years, Ecurie Ecosse has been a David vs Goliath team. In the 50s, they were run from a backstreet mews garage in Edinburgh with not a lot of budget, almost like a group of friends and businessmen getting together and making best use of what they had available in terms of mechanics and engineers and beating the factory teams.</p>

      <p>“It’s always pretty satisfying if you’re the underdog beating the big guys, if you’re in a car with a fraction of the budget and you go and beat everyone.</p>
      <p>“Scotland has something to be very proud of in motorsport – look at all the great drivers that have come out of Scotland and Ecurie Ecosse is part of that. They weren’t always the best truck in the paddock with the flashiest equipment but they got the job done and at the end of the day, it’s all about winning races.</p>
      <p>“That was the golden era of motorsport.”</p>

      <p>In its early days, Ecurie Ecosse recruited up-and-comers like Jimmy Stewart, who would later bring in his younger brother Jackie. The future Sir Jackie was at Ecurie before heading to Formula 1 with Tyrrell and winning three world championships.</p>
      <p>Team boss Murray and his pit crew, led by Wilkie Wilkinson, were working all the time to improve and get closer to the giants of the sport.</p>
      <p>By 1956, they were ready to take a chance.</p>
      <p>Using an older Jaguar D-Type, they had drivers Ron Flockhart and Ninian Sanderson at the wheel.</p>
      <p>And they claimed an impressive win – literally beating reigning champions Jaguar at their own game – and knocking the other big boys like Aston and Ferrari out of the way.</p>
      <p>What’s more, Flockhart and driver Ivor Bueb went on to win the title again the following year.</p>
      <p>The first win, against a field of better funded and more experienced teams, was like Leicester City winning the English Premier League.</p>
      <p>To retain it was astonishing.</p>

      <p>Alasdair said: “They were not expecting to win. They were a privateer team going against the huge factories and their aim was just to beat the Jaguar factory cars. But Ecurie Ecosse were very good at engineering the cars, better than the factory, and with a select few people, they went out there and did the job.</p>
      <p>“To do it twice in a row was all the better.”</p>
      <p>Scots motorsport writer and history expert Graham Gauld remembers the incredible story.</p>
      <p>He said: “In 1956, one could say they were cannon fodder against all the big factory teams from Britain and Italy. Thanks to good organisation and planning, they surprised everyone.</p>
      <p>“Their secret was just watching the opposition and maintaining a steady fast race for 24 hours while the main factory teams were racing so hard, many of their key drivers dropped out.</p>
      <p>“Regarding 1966 and the Le Mans race featured in the movie, Ecurie Ecosse had, by that time, brought on some other Scottish racing drivers who were to become successful, notably Jackie Stewart, who raced with the team in 1963 and 1964 before moving into Formula 1.</p>
      <p>“They had also helped Innes Ireland on his way up the racing ladder but the team were no longer racing cars that were eligible for the Le Mans 24-hour race.</p>
      <p>“By the end of the 60s, the original Ecurie Ecosse team just could not keep up financially with the way racing was going and then David Murray left Edinburgh for the Canary Islands following financial problems and though the team continued for three years, it finally closed down in 1971.”</p>

      <p>The title of the brand had been held privately by friends of Ecurie Ecosse and in 1984, it was revived by Edinburgh business man Hugh McCaig, Alasdair’s father.</p>
      <p>As a child, he had idolised the 50s track heroes and now oversaw a very successful period for the team – his drivers included Allan McNish, David Coulthard and Dario Franchitti, among others.</p>
      <p>Hugh’s incarnation saw a return to Le Mans and in 1986, they won the World Sportscar Championship, took part in world group stage championships and then British Touring Cars with Vauxhall and Nissan.</p>
      <p>Into the 2000s, the team entered a fallow period but in 2011, his son took over the reins and the titles have returned, along with that trademark ambition.</p>
      <p>Alasdair, 37, works as a property developer and runs Ecurie Ecosse as well as racing. He has several trophies in his garage. But he revealed they have big plans for the future.</p>
      <p>He said: “Ecurie Ecosse has so much history but we have to look forward as well.</p>
      <p>“In the last couple of years, we have won the British GP championship, been runner-up in the Spa 24 Hours, had two podiums, and won the LMP3 championship.</p>
      <p>“Aside from all the racing, we also do a lot to support young drivers in terms of mentoring them. Allan McNish is our ambassador.”</p>
      <p>The firm is also producing a Scots supercar – the street legal LM69, worth up to £850,000 and capable of speeds of 190mph.</p>
      <p>Titled in honour of a Jaguar that was prototyped in 1969 for Le Mans but never developed, the stunning new model, which means Le Mans 69, is the future of the team.</p>
      <p>Alasdair said: “There’s nothing like it in the world – and it’ll be quick. Our long-term goal is take Ecurie Ecosse back to Le Mans.”</p>
