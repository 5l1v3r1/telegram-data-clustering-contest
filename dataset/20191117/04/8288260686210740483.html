      <h3>DEFENDER KNOWS HE HAS TO IMPROVE</h3>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers defender Max Kilman has opened up on the time it has taken for him to reach the level required to play for the club’s first team.</p>
      <p>Kilman signed for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> from non-league side Maidenhead United in the summer of 2018, and has since been battling for a place in manager Nuno Espirito Santo’s starting line-up.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old made his debut for Wolves in May this year as a substitute in Wolves’ 1-0 Premier League win over Fulham last season.</p>
      <p>Since then, the centre-back is yet to feature in the Premier League for Wolves, but has played a part in the cup competitions.</p>
      <p>Kilman has played the full 90 minutes in Wolves’ back-to-back victories over Slovan Bratislava in the Europa League, and now the defender is eyeing a Premier League start.</p>
      <p>The defender has admitted that he needed time to get to the level required by Nuno to feature in the first-team.</p>

      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers striker <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/raul-jimenez">Raul Jimenez</a> was on target twice as he helped Mexico secure qualification to next year’s CONCACAF Nations League semi-finals.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> frontman was in form for his country as he bagged two goals in a 3-0 win away at Panama on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Jimenez opened the scoring in the 8th minute in a scrappy game in Estadio Rommel Fernandez, set up a Edson Alvarez's tap in in the 70th and sealed the win with a late penalty.</p>
      <p>Mexico are next in action on Tuesday night against Bermuda, where Jimenez will be keen to add to his goal tally.</p>
      <p>The Wolves striker is happy for his county to win against a country that has been a difficult opponent for Mexico down the years.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy with the result, because historically we don't do well here [but] the goals went through for us," Jimenez told ESPN.</p>
      <p>Wolves return to Premier League action next Saturday against Bournemouth, in what will be a quick turnaround for Jimenez given he will in action on the other side of the world in the early hours of Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old says that he is “perfecting” his role at Wolves, but is keen to keep on improving for the Molineux outfit.</p>
