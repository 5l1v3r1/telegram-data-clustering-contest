      <p>Salman Khan was at his best on Saturday night as he interacted with the <i>Bigg Boss </i>contestants. From slamming Rashami Desai for being double-faced to declaring Asiam Riaz a ‘He-Man’; he most striking feature of <i>Weekend Ka Vaar </i>saw Salman mimicking Amitabh Bachchan. Bachchan featuring on <i>Bigg Boss </i>came a week after his daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai was mentioned by a contestant during her conversation with Salman. Himanshi Khurana comparing herself with Salman’s ex-girlfriend had <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/after-amitabh-bachchans-kbc-aishwarya-rai-features-on-bigg-boss-show-as-host-salman-khan-left-speechless/272104/">left the <i>Bharat </i>star</a> speechless for several seconds.</p>

      <p>On Saturday night, contestants were asked to tag each other with the most-suitable title according to their performance in the house. One of the titles was of <i>bol bachchan, </i>which in English is reserved for those known for making tall and fake claims. While most housemates had given the tag to Hindustani Bhau, Salman overruled them and said that Arhaan Khan was more suited for the infamous title.</p>
      <p>Addressing Arhaan, the <i>Bigg Boss </i>host said that the title of <i>bol bachchan </i>did not mean that he was now being compared with Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan. “Don’t take it as a compliment that I am now comparing you with Amit Ji. It means that you are indulging in fakery by making tall and fake claims.”</p>
      <p>He then mimicked Amitabh Bachchan by delivering a line in Big B’s inimitable style.</p>
      <p>Salman also showered praises on Asim Riaz calling him a ‘He-Man.’ “You are playing it beautifully. You entered the house as a beautiful man, who has now turned into a He-Man. Everyone is proud of you. You are doing very well.”</p>
