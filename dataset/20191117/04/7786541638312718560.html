      <p>Video shows two female employees hitting each other around 9:30 p.m. Wednesday while several other workers try to pry them apart and keep them at bay, <a href="https://fox6now.com/2019/11/15/7-employees-were-terminated-vicious-brawl-at-milwaukee-popeyes-caught-on-cellphone-video/">WITI reported</a>. </p>
      <p>"I heard one of them yell, 'It's a fight,’" Richard Fourté, who recorded the video, <a href="https://fox6now.com/2019/11/15/7-employees-were-terminated-vicious-brawl-at-milwaukee-popeyes-caught-on-cellphone-video/">told WITI</a>. "They ran to the back by the grills, OK. Now, there was a fight back there. I didn't get that one on tape."</p>
      <p>Police arrived but did not arrest anyone. It is unclear what led to the fracas.</p>
      <p>“This was an unfortunate, isolated incident which we take very seriously,” <a href="https://fox6now.com/2019/11/15/7-employees-were-terminated-vicious-brawl-at-milwaukee-popeyes-caught-on-cellphone-video/">John Brodersen, Popeyes franchise owner, told WITI</a>. “The dining room was closed immediately after the altercation at 9:30 p.m. As a result of this, seven employees were terminated from the company, including the manager on duty.”</p>
      <p>Popeyes restaurants across the country have been the scene of violent incidents. </p>
      <p>Earlier this month, a <a href="https://www.wftv.com/news/trending-now/woman-55-body-slammed-at-popeyes-in-tennessee/1006908089">55-year-old woman was body slammed</a> in the parking lot of a Tennessee location. In another incident, a customer and employee were seen on video throwing trays at each other at <a href="https://www.kiro7.com/amp/news/trending-now/woman-employee-throw-trays-at-each-other-during-fight-at-popeyes-video-shows/1006268066">a San Antonio restaurant</a>. Before that, a man was <a href="https://www.wftv.com/news/trending-now/man-found-fatally-stabbed-outside-maryland-popeyes/1005138529">fatally stabbed for cutting</a> in line at a Maryland Popeyes. </p>
