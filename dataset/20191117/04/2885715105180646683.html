      <p>Sri Lanka leg spinner Kevin Koththigoda has grabbed eyeballs with his unusual bowling action in the T10 League in Abu Dhabi. He was seen bowling to the likes of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/shane-watson/">Shane Watson</a> and Anton Devcich in the match between Bangla Tigers and Deccan Gladiators on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Koththigoda’s action has been compared to former South Africa spinner Paul Adams, whose ‘frog in a blender’ action took international cricket by storm a couple of decades ago.</p>
      <p>The spinner conceded 22 runs in his 2 overs on Saturday. He did manage to flummox Watson on a couple of occasions, but the Australian was able to smash him for sixes on two occasions.</p>

      <p>Asked to bat first, the Tigers scored 108 for 5 in 10 overs. Colin Ingram top-scored for the side, blasting 37 from 21 while Rilee Rossouw scored 26 from 12. In reply, the Gladiators chased down the total with a ball to spare. Shane Watson starred for the Gladiators, scoring 41 from 25 balls.</p>
      <p>Koththigoda had been seen in the U-19 Asia Cup in 2017.</p>

      <p>“He has a very unusual action. It’s like that of Paul Adams. The action wasn’t coached or anything, it came naturally to him. Initially, he was struggling with the length as he couldn’t see the pitch, but he has improved tremendously,” his coach Dhammika Sudarshana had told Cricbuzz in 2017.</p>
