      <p>Pranay Jaiswal (28), hailing from Amravati, had completed postgraduation in general surgery from KEM hospital and was serving his postgraduate bond at the hospital as a specialist medical officer.</p>
      <p>When Jaiswal’s body was found around 11.30 am on Saturday on the terrace of the resident medical officer’s hostel building, IV tubes were still found attached to his hand. A bag was found next to him, but no suicide note has been recovered so far. Doctors suspect he had committed suicide at least 12 hours before his body was found.</p>
      <p>According to his colleagues, Jaiswal may have been driven to commit suicide after he recently broke up with his girlfriend. But police said he was also suffering from depression for the last six months due to a family dispute and was even prescribed anti-depressants.</p>

      <p>Jaiswal’s roommate Samarth Patel noticed that he was missing on Friday evening. Patel went on to inform other doctors, following which they started looking for Jaiswal. “Patel and Jaiswal shared a room for the last three years. In his statement, Patel has said that the deceased was taking medicines for depression,” said Kamble. Forensic experts said Jaiswal showed signs of respiratory failure, but due to the administration which drug is unknown. No other physical injuries were found on the body. His organs have been preserved for chemical analysis. “There are hundreds of drugs that can be used to commit suicide if one knows how to use them. He had carried it in his bag to the terrace,” a doctor said.</p>
      <p>Dr Hemant Deshmukh, Dean of KEM hospital, said the police has been handed over Jaiswal’s cellphone and bag. “He was sincere in his work, and a gold medallist,” a doctor from the hospital said. Jaiswal had also published research paper to assess role of prophylactic octreotide in preventing pancreas-related disorders.</p>
