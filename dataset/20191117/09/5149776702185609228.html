      <p>It is hoped the project to transform <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>’s City Ground into a world-class venue will take 15 months from start date to completion.</p>
      <p>Redevelopment plans for the Reds’ home were announced earlier this year and will see the Peter Taylor Stand rebuilt to cater for an increased capacity of about 10,000 fans, as well as improvements made to the other three sides of the ground - with the Bridgford Stand also extended.</p>
      <p>It is anticipated <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-plans-3386066">the planning application</a> will be submitted before the end of the year, following a public exhibition at the City Ground this week.</p>
      <p>If permission is granted, it is hoped work could get underway during the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>And while it will take more than a year to complete fully, Benoy - the architectural firm behind <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-reveal-amazing-new-3540790">the multi-million pound project</a> - hope as many as 5,000 seats could be available in the new Peter Taylor Stand a few months into the work starting.</p>
      <p>“When we went out to the construction market and spoke to a number of contractors, we gave them a couple of challenges,” said Tom Cartledge, lead architect and CEO of Benoy.</p>
      <p>“One was to deliver the vision and not water that down. But also, one was to look at the programme of work.</p>
      <p>“Very quickly we started to look at a 15-month programme.</p>
      <p>“That is 15 months from the moment the first seat is taken out of the old Peter Taylor Stand - the demolition through to the completion of everything within the main new stand.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“What we’re also looking at doing is trying to bring forward, within that 15-month period, a number of seats.</p>
      <p>“If we look at the mathematics, there are about 6,000 or 5,500 seats at the moment in the Peter Taylor Stand. We’d like to get those 5,500 back open again as quick as possible to make sure we mitigate the challenges of relocating people around the ground and other things. That, of course, is first and foremost in many people’s minds.</p>
      <p>“What we’re looking to try and do is get that down, far less than a season and certainly not one, two, three or four seasons, which you will have heard of other stories in the past.</p>
      <p>“But we’ll be slightly dictated to by how we build the stand, and that may be impacted by planning. But very much our ambition is to try to reduce that period.”</p>
      <p>Cartledge says Forest owner <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/evangelos-marinakis">Evangelos Marinakis</a> has played a key part in the City Ground project, with the Greek making clear that it should be done “properly”.</p>
      <p>Much work has been going on behind the scenes since the plans were first announced in March - and it is expected to ramp up further in the coming months.</p>
      <p>“Over the next few days we have <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3507012">the consultation period,</a> where we’re looking for as many fans and non-fans and local residents to give us their thoughts and opinions,” said Cartledge, who is a Reds fan.</p>
      <p>“The next few weeks after that, then we begin to take it into the formal planning process.</p>
      <p>“The next two days are about sharing this with a wider audience and asking people’s opinions.</p>
      <p>“Alongside that, we continue to talk and work with Rushcliffe Borough Council, who have been an excellent partner.</p>

      <p>“Their planning office and planning team have been supportive, but rightly challenging as well, to make sure we consider lots of components as we put this together.</p>
      <p>“We will work with them over the next few days and weeks. And we look forward to putting a planning application in towards the end of this month.</p>
      <p>“Then we go through a formal statutory period, which is between 12 and 16 weeks and will take us into next year.</p>
      <p>“The right message from Mr Marinakis to us has been, ‘let’s do this properly rather than rushing it’.</p>

      <p>“So we really haven’t set beyond those critical dates.</p>
      <p>“I know fans are keen to understand the timeline and ‘will it be next year?’. But the truth is we’ve got to make sure we get the right planning scheme through first.</p>
      <p>“And then, if timing allows and it is possible to do things quick, there might be an opportunity to look at it towards the end of the season. If not, we’ll look at the process and the things that come out of the planning.”</p>
