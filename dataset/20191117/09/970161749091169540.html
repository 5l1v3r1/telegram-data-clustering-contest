      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a>’s explosive interview on BBC Newsnight has been described as a ‘plane crashing into an oil tanker’ as thousands reacted online.</p>
      <p>Viewers watched as the Duke of York told presenter Emily Maitlis he could not have had sex with the woman accusing him because <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-was-at-pizza-express-day-accuser-claims-she-was-forced-into-sex-with-him-11168884/">he had taken daughter Beatrice to Pizza Express</a> on that specific date.</p>
      <p>The interview has been trending on Twitter since last night’s interview was broadcast, as have the words<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/pizza-express-woking-flooded-fake-reviews-prince-andrew-interview-11169085/"> Pizza Express and #PizzaGate.</a></p>
      <p>The Duke was grilled about his controversial friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, where he admitted he did not regret his relationship with the disgraced billionaire.</p>
      <p>But he said it was wrong to have stayed with Epstein after he was accused of child abuse and admitted that he ‘let the side down’.</p>

      <p>Virginia Roberts – now named Virginia Giuffre – is one of 16 women who says she was abused by Epstein and claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince three times between 2001 and 2002.</p>

      <p>Mrs Giuffre said she was trafficked when she was 17 and was forced into sexual encounters with the Duke in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein.</p>
      <p>But the Duke claims he could not have had sex with her after allegedly meeting her at London nightclub Tramp on 10 March, 2001 – when she was 17 – as he had been at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking that evening and went home afterwards.</p>
      <p>Reaction to the ‘no holds barred’ interview has flooded social media today.</p>
      <p>TV presenter Giles Coren said he was not convinced by the pizza story, tweeting: ‘Ask him what he ordered. If he says “a sloppy Giuseppe” you’ve got him. Because they didn’t introduce that till 2006.’</p>
      <p>Later in the interview Prince Andrew was told how Mrs Guiffre had been ‘very specific’ about him that night, claiming he was ‘profusely sweating’ and that she went on to have a bath.</p>
      <p>The duke told Ms Maitlis there was a ‘slight problem’ with that story – claiming he was unable to perspire at the time.</p>

      <p>He also claimed he had ‘no recollection’ of a photo of himself and Mrs Giuffre, that has been widely shared in the press, ever being taken.</p>

      <p>The duke was slammed for his grammar by many online, including comedian David Baddiel, after he admitted: ‘That is what I’d describe as me in that photograph’.</p>
      <p>Catherine Mayer, founder of the Women’s Equality Party, questioned the Prince’s intelligence, saying he was ‘too stupid to even pretend concern for Epstein’s victims’.</p>
      <p>Of the interview overall, Royal Central website editor Charlie Proctor said: ‘I expected a train wreck.</p>
      <p>‘That was a plane crashing into an oil tanker, causing a tsunami, triggering a nuclear explosion level bad.’</p>
      <p>Comedian Dom Joly also described it as ‘a worse car crash than getting a lift home from Prince Philip’.</p>

      <p>While former diplomat Craig Murray, who was the British Ambassador to Uzbekistan from 2002 to 2004, said he suspected ‘the only true thing Prince Andrew said the entire interview was that he never pays for the drinks’.</p>
      <p>The duke’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson defended him before the interview aired, saying: ‘It is so rare to meet people that are able to speak from their hearts with honesty and pure real truth, that remain steadfast and strong to their beliefs.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Andrew is a true and real gentleman and is stoically steadfast to not only his duty but also his kindness and goodness.’</p>
      <p>Epstein, 66, a convicted sex offender, was found dead in a New York jail cell in August, while awaiting federal trial for sex trafficking.</p>
      <p>Andrew stayed with Epstein at his home and the pair were photographed together in New York in Central Park after the businessman had been convicted for the prostitution of minors in 2010.</p>
      <p>But the Duke told the journalist that it would be ‘a considerable stretch’ to say he and Epstein were ‘very, very close’ friends.</p>

      <p>He claimed that it was in fact Epstein’s girlfriend, Ms Maxwell, who ‘was the key element in this’, as she was invited to Buckingham Palace in 2000 and that the financier was invited as a ‘plus one to some extent’.</p>
      <p>The Duke said he called off his friendship with Epstein in 2010 as he didn’t think it was ‘appropriate’, ‘because of what has happened’, following Epstein’s conviction in 2008.</p>
      <p>He said the whole episode had not been damaging to the Queen, only to himself, and that the wider royal family ‘couldn’t be more supportive’.</p>
