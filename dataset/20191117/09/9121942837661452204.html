      <p>LONDON (AP) — The first north London derby in the Women’s Super League produced a record crowd of 38,262 for the competition on Sunday when Arsenal claimed a 2-0 victory at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>The newly fully professional side held out until the 66th minute when Kim Little struck for the champions and Vivianne Miedema extended Arsenal’s lead in the 82nd minute.</p>
      <p>It was the first time Tottenham, in its first top-flight campaign, had staged women’s football at its main 61,000-capacity stadium, which opened earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The crowd surpassed the 31,213 at Manchester City for the visit of Manchester United on the opening weekend of the season in September.</p>
      <p>Tottenham hosted Arsenal on the first designated Women’s Football Weekend in England which also saw 23,500 at Anfield for Liverpool’s 1-0 loss to Everton.</p>
      <p>Chelsea opened the season by hosting Tottenham in front of around 25,000 at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>League leaders Chelsea were back at their usual home of Kingsmeadow on Sunday. Maren Mjelde’s penalty sealed a 1-0 victory over promoted Manchester United in front of 4,790 fans — a WSL record crowd for a game not played in a large stadium usually used by the men’s team.</p>
