        <b>It’s how all great horror stories begin: with a ‘possessed’ infant on a baby monitor. </b>
      </p>
      <p>From <i>Paranormal Activity</i> to <i>Insidious</i>, from <i>Poltergeist</i> to <i>Rosemary’s Baby</i>, modern day movie-watchers have been subjected to countless doses of domestic terror – with creepy children often being a fixture.</p>
      <p>So when these parents had a look at their baby monitor to check on their little one, only to see the child with brightly glowing eyes, the gut reaction is: ‘Demon baby!’</p>

      <p>Posted by Passion Pop Socialist, the tweet has racked up more than 401,000 likes and 81,000 retweets, with people flocking from all over the world to catch a glimpse at the ‘possessed baby’. Some people even described it as ‘something from Silent Hill’.</p>
      <p>The tweet reads: ‘We got a new video baby monitor and I think that was a mistake.’</p>

      <p>Some people appear to be genuinely frightened by the cute demon. One person wrote: ‘My screen flickered when I opened this pic.’ Another replied: ‘I hate everyone who liked this because now I will have nightmares. Thank you.’</p>
      <p>
        <b>The parent, orchestrating fantastic banter, added: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>On a related note, does anyone have experience with a good noise generator app? Every one that I’ve tried so far is just layers of whispered chanting in Latin instead of white noise. It still puts Finn to sleep but I don’t like it.</blockquote>
      <p>Don’t worry, the parent is absolutely joking. They added: ‘A lot of people are giving me legit advice here, which I appreciate but this was a joke. I actually use Relaxio and it’s really great.’</p>

      <p>Alas, people have been offering up their advice on how to tackle demonic parenting.</p>
      <p>
        <b>One user suggested a baptism, but the parent replied: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>We did but it turned the water to blood, the priest started climbing up the walls, it was a whole thing.</blockquote>
      <p>Another user offered a fairly intricate solution: ‘1. Get out of the house 2. Leave the baby and leave a warning for the next owners 3. Let them buy it anyway 4. Horrors ensue 5. Find a desperate up and coming “writer” 6. sell your story 7. Go on a lavish vacation 8. Have a new baby 9. Buy a different monitor.’</p>
      <p>Some have even likened the child to a young Homelander from <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/film-and-tv/production-wraps-on-the-boys-season-2/">Amazon Prime’s <i>The Boys</i></a>, who has a range of powers – including laser vision.</p>

      <p>Most hilariously of all, another parent replied with their own amazing story. One night they thought there was a ghost in their baby’s cot – however, they’d just left the sticker on with a stock image of a child.</p>

      <p>Still, maybe book an exorcism – just to be safe.</p>
