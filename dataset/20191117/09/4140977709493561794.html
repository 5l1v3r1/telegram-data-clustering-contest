            <b>NOR Vs TAB Dream11 Team, Probable Playing 11, Toss, Pitch And Match Report: A win takes Northern Warriors to the top of Group B today.</b>
          </p>
          <p>With all the teams in Group B have plied their qualities in their opening match of the T10 league, the group has started taking shape to give us an insight into which teams could end up easing into the next round. And one side who’ll be looking to ascertain themselves of a berth in the semi-finals will be Northern Warriors with the team throwing open the doors of their life in the ongoing edition of the marquee league with aplomb.</p>
          <p>Currently in second place after winning their league opener, Northern Warriors will be out striving to achieve a second straight win against Team Abu Dhabi. However what will massively hurt the side is the way they were dismissed in their previous encounter, a clash which saw them being battered by 66 runs by Qalandar as the side put in a chastening showing with the bat o completely lose their way in their run way.</p>

                <p>Needing 113 to win, the 46 runs strung up by the side in their pursuit epitomised how horrid the side’s chase was. It not only hampered their chances of making it into the next round but saw their net run-rate take a huge battering as well, one the side know they can only paper over with a win today.</p>
                <p>Elsewhere, their opponents are one of the only two sides to have partaken in the sole drawn encounter in the league till now after they and Qalandar both ended up on 113 runs in the side’s foregone contest. Currently in third place, a defeat for the side toady will end their chances of making it to the proceeding round, making the ramifications stemming from this one immense.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>The surface prevelant over here is as good as they come for the bats with this being a completely hard, dry and brown wicket where the batters will love playing their shots. The side winning the toss will be looking to step out and field first today.</p>

                              <b>Northern Warriors</b>

                            </ul>
                            <h3>NOR vs TAB Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>We are opting for Niroshan Dickwella for this encounter with the wicket-keeper not only coming out to open but being someone who can pile on the runs in quick time as well, a narrative he revelled us in the last time around with 17 runs in 7 balls.</p>
                            <p>We are also getting in Sam Billings from Northern Warriors despite the player yet to engage us in a pure show of clean hitting. However, he’s someone who comes imbued with the innate ability to take the bowlers to the cleaners, making him a must have option for the day.</p>
                            <h3>NOR vs TAB Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>After their horrid display with the bat the last time around, veering clear of the batting picks from Northern Warriors would have been extremely easy but the side are coming across a unit who ended up shipping the 113 runs the last time around. This is just the kind of bowling unit which could see Geroge Munsey recover his trounce, seeing us entrust the side’s opener for the tie.</p>
                            <p>From the other side meanwhile we are getting in a duo in the form of Corey Anderson and Luke Wright. While Wright got 20 runs in the previous encounter, Corey Anderson needed just 22 balls to strike his way to 43 runs, making the payer someone we envisage tottering his way to another high scoring knock.</p>
                            <h3>NOR vs TAB Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Andre Russel was unimpressive in the previous match but the player hit a half-century in his side’s league opener win along with taking the one wicket in the last match to see us opt for the player for this encounter. He finds company in the form of Chris Wood whilst from Team Abu Dhabi we have decided to indulge in their captain Moeen Ali given the high batting slot he occupies in his team’s unit.</p>
                            <h3>NOR vs TAB Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Harry Gurney failed to pick up a wicket but his restrictive spell of 2-14 was a testament to the pulsating brand of bowling the quick is revered for. His fortitude and resolve sees us stick in with him for this alongside Marchant de Lange who returned with the two wickets for his side in the last outing.</p>
                            <p>From Northern warriors we’ll be getting in the lone player with two wicket man from the previous tie, Chris Wood bringing an end to our Dream 11 side for the day. </p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>We have decided to make Wright our side’s captain for this encounter with Russell our choice as the vice-captain.</p>
