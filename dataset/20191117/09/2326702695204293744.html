      <p><a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/nzxt">NZXT</a> is one of the top <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/pc/">PC</a> hardware brands on the market today. They’ve long been a fan favourite when it comes to PC cases especially. From their iconic Phantom series, up to their 2019 flagship Elite series. We’ve reviewed dozens of their cases over the years, but few come with as much anticipation as the NZXT H510 Elite.</p>
      <h3>NZXT H510 Elite</h3>
      <p>Equipped with support for an ATX motherboard, this powerful mid-tower is built for the enthusiasts. Despite the compact size, however, it’s certainly a capable case. It’ll handle large graphics cards, vertical GPU mounting, some AIO coolers or custom loop hardware and more. Plus, since it comes equipped with their Smart Device V2 hub, it’ll offer up easy RGB support for your hardware. Of course, it comes with <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/rgb">RGB</a> fans and even an RGB light strip pre-installed, so it has customisation built-in from the moment you take it out of the box.</p>

      <h3>What NZXT Had to Say</h3>
      <blockquote>“The H510 Elite compact ATX mid-tower is perfect for your RGB build. Behind the flush-mounted, tempered glass front panel, you’ll discover our renowned Aer RGB 2 fans keeping your components brilliantly cool. Well-engineered airflow, removable radiator mounting bracket, multiple fan filters, vertical GPU mount, a front panel USB-C connector, and an all-steel and tempered glass construction are just some of the key features you’ll get. The H510 Elite also includes the NZXT Smart Device V2, powering the built-in RGB light strips and case fans.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Exterior</h3>
      <p>The H510 Elite bares the same ergonomic design as the H510 (non-Elite), but with a few major differences to the aesthetic. The front is no longer a pained metal panel, but another piece of gorgeous tempered glass instead. Plus, there are two massive AER RGB fans behind it. Worried about airflow? I was too, but it comes in from both a filtered ventilation section on the right side as well as on the base of the panel.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114521.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Because the case interior is black and the windows are dark tinted, they are quite reflective in a bright room. Of course, once you turn on any RGB lighting in the case, that’ll tip the balance nicely and show off your hardware.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114533.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Upon the top, you’ll find a mesh section to mount an AIO cooler or exhaust fan.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114555-880x779.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It’ll support either 120/140mm fan, so you’ve got a few options here.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114601-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>I/O</h3>
      <p>The front I/O panel is superb compact, with just a single USB 3.0 port, a USB Type-C, and a combi audio-jack. It does come with a Y-splitter in the box should you need it though.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114607-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The lower half of the case is all-steel construction and finished with a lightly textured black paint. There’s a very subtle NZXT logo on there too, but you’ll have to look hard to see it; I love minimal branding on my cases though.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114615-880x704.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The stance on this case is seriously cool though, and framing the glass by having the PSU shroud form part of the external case works really well.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114622.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Ventilation</h3>
      <p>Down the right side, you’ll find a thick metal panel. Down the front edge, there’s a large amount of ventilation, which will feed the front fans with cool air; may not be a good idea to have this side pushed against a wall!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114640.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Around the back, it’s business as usual really. There’s room for an ATX motherboard, so you’ll find seven expansion slots. However, there’s an additional vertical two-slot mount for vertical GPU mounting. Of course, you’ll need to provide your own riser cable to use this.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114700.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Interior</h3>
      <p>The interior of the case is incredibly spacious. This is thanks to a built-in power supply shroud, as well as having front fans partially integrated into the front panel. Of course, as you can see, there are no hard drive cages in the front either, leaving room larger graphics cards. There is a good size CPU cooler mounting cut-out behind the motherboard, as well the custom cable routing cover on the right. While the case does not use rubber grommets for cable routing there are large cut-outs dotted around the top and bottom of the motherboard should you need them.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114833-880x739.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The power supply shroud covers the full length of the case, but also provides an additional cable routing hole for your graphics card power supply cables. There is also quite a large amount of ventilation here; perfect for the hard drive cages below it, as well as the power supply itself.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114838-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The cable management bar looks pretty cool, but should it actually be in your way, it can be removed. Personally, I’m happy to leave it in right now, and it’s a nice change from the usual grommet design.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114842-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>AER</h3>
      <p>In the front of the case, you’ll find two NZXT AER 140mm fans. These are easily some of the coolest looking fans on the market today, but should also deliver superb performance. Furthermore, they have built-in RGB lighting which is wired into the included hub and ready to rock. However, there’s a motherboard header for expanding the RGB chain or connecting to other devices.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114846-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114852-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114859-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>In the rear of the case, you will find excellent clearance around the expansion slots. All of the screws are accessible from the rear of the case rather than the interior. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114922-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Exhaust</h3>
      <p>While the rear fan does not feature RGB lighting, it is still a very high-quality fan and perfect for the exhaust. Of course, you have an additional mount in the top of the case, giving you plenty of options to add an AIO. You’re not missing out on RGB here, however, as there is an additional lighting strip pre-installed along the top of the case; this will provide plenty of lighting within the case to show off your hardware.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114926-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_114930-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Behind the Motherboard</h3>
      <p>Behind the motherboard, there is plenty of space for routing your cables, although the bulk of it can also be stuffed under the power supply shroud should you need extra space.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_115006-880x715.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Directly behind the motherboard, you’ll find two removable SSD mounting brackets.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_115010-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Towards the top front of the case, NZXT has included their smart fan hub. All of the included fans and RGB components are pre-wired to this for ease of use. However, you will need to hook up power, a USB header, as well as install the desktop software in order to control the lighting.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_115015-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Below the Shroud</h3>
      <p>Below the shroud, you’ll find two 3.5” hard drive bays, hiding the drives out of sight for a cleaner-looking build. However, if it is in your way you can remove the bracket entirely. Come to think of it, every HDD/SSD mount is hidden in this case.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_115026-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Behind that, you will find room for a good size power supply; there is plenty of ventilation above as well as a filtered air intake below.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_115031-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Complete System</h3>
      <p>Building our demo system inside this case was pretty straightforward. There’s loads of room on the interior despite the H510 Elite only being a mid-tower case. Furthermore, the excellent cable routing options help to maintain a clean looking build as well as unrestricted airflow throughout.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_104440-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The power supply shroud does a fantastic job of hiding most of your cables. Of course, you can see through it to some degree but only if you look pretty close, and even less so once the tempered glass window is back in place. While you can mount the power supply the other way around, I left ours facing up as this allowed me to show off the RGB lighting of the power supply. Not everyone will want to do this, but it’s nice to have the option. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_104450-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>GPU Clearance</h3>
      <p>Installing a massive graphics card clearly isn’t an issue, the RTX 2070 from AORUS is one of the longest and widest cards on the market today and it still has plenty of room to spare.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_104454-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Clearance around the CPU is superb, allowing for a large air cooler to be installed. Of course, with a fan mount in the back and top of the case, you have the options to mount an AIO cooler here too. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_104458-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>AIO to Air</h3>
      <p>Furthermore, you could mount a radiator in the front of the case. While custom loop cooling and other forms of liquid cooling are possible here, the case is very well set up for air-cooled builds; which I personally prefer due to their easy maintenance and setup. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_104505-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>As I said before, there’s great clearance between the graphics cards and the fans, so you do have plenty of options to play around with when it comes to choosing your components.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_104507-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Just below the graphics card, you will find a vertical power supply cable cut out. This allows you to easily pass cables through to your graphics cards and other expansion cards. Honestly, why don’t all cases don’t have this?! </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_104512-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Shiny</h3>
      <p>Overall it is very clean looking build on the interior with plenty of space around all the important hardware. The cable management looks fantastic and massive fans in the front provide a huge wall of air to keep everything performing at its best. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_104518-880x827.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>With all the windows back in place, we can appreciate how clean and stylish this case really is. Of course, it does reflect a lot of ambient light, such as what is being displayed on my monitor on the left. Obviously, that will vary depending on where you placed the case. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_104613-880x508.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Being able to show off your build from multiple angles, as well as enjoy the view of those gorgeous looking fans in the front, is certainly paying off well. It’s a great looking case, anyone would be proud to show off their rig inside it. </p>
      <h3>Stylish</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_104626-880x472.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I’m happy to show off this build on top of my desk where all can see it. However, I’m sure it’s going to look just fine the below or off to the side of your desk too.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191115_104653-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>How Much Does it Cost?</h3>
      <p>The NZXT H510 Elite is available now for <a href="https://amzn.to/2Oj52XI">£149.99 in the UK</a> and around <a href="https://amzn.to/2QmS6CN">$165 in the US</a>. That’s certainly not cheap, but given the overall build quality, dual tempered glass design, built-in smart hub for fans and RGB, and the premium fans included, it’s about on par with the competition. It’s around the same as the Dark Base 700, Corsair 570X, and Phanteks P600S.</p>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>NZXT has done a fantastic job with their latest PC case. The H510 Elite is by far one of my favourite cases on the market right now, as are many of the other NZXT cases available today. I’ve long been a fan of the brand and many of the cases they have produced over the years, I’ve even owned a few of them myself too. While the latest case doesn’t really offer much in the way of innovation, it does look and feel like a more premium version of the Standard H510. Of course, that was their intention and they’re right on the money with it.</p>
      <h3>Upgraded to Elite</h3>
      <p>I don’t mean to make it sound as crude and simple as “they stuck an extra window on there and an extra hub inside” but that’s pretty much the meat of it. There are a few other little tweaks though, such as the revised ventilation on the side panel, the quality of the fans that are pre-installed, and the RGB light strip in the top of the case. It is a simple case of economics; paying a bit more and getting a bit more. Honestly, I’m OK with this and while the original case is still brilliant, this is subjectively a little bit better. </p>
      <h3>Premium Build Quality</h3>
      <p>I certainly have no issues with the build quality here, as it is a very robust case and very well engineered. All the panels are easy to remove without the use of tools, and the panel gaps are snug as a bug; you shouldn’t have air or dust leaking in or out of areas you don’t want it to. The tempered glass has a nice tint to it, and it matches up well with the lightly textured matt black paintwork. It’s not the most outlandish case when it comes to detail work, it’s just clean, well designed, and well made; I’m sure we can all appreciate that. </p>
      <h3>Should I Buy One?</h3>
      <p>If you are using the non-elite case, then it is basically the same case on the interior. I wouldn’t be pushed to upgrade anytime soon. However, if you’re looking at the stock version of this case and you have a little extra budget for something a little shinier, then it’s nice that NZXT has something to offer you. It’s the same H510 you know and love, tweaked and improved to make it better than ever.</p>
