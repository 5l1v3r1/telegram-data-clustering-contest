      <h1>Santiago Solari admits desire to manage in England and speaks of Leeds United appreciation</h1>
      <h2>Leeds United are one of the reasons why the former Argentina international is such a fan of English football.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T09:45:41+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Former Real Madrid manager Santiago Solari has been discussing his desire to manage in England. The Argentine <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7686203/Santiago-Solari-plots-Premier-League-reveals-desire-replicate-Jurgen-Klopps-style.html">was speaking to the Daily Mail </a>after recently taking in a game between Chelsea and Crystal Palace in the Premier League. </p>
      <p>He spoke of his love of the English game and suggested a meeting with Leeds United was one of the main reasons behind that affinity. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“</b>
        <b>I’d love to coach in England. I watch a lot of Premier League football. It’s a top league enjoying a great moment in its history. There are many amazing players and some of the best coaches. There are many different nationalities, styles of play and four teams in the two European finals last year.</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>“They had a great side – (Mark) Viduka, (Rio) Ferdinand, (Olivier) Dacourt, (Alan) Smith.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Of course, that Leeds side went on to make the semi-finals of the Champions League that season, despite losing to Solari’s Real Madrid twice in the second group stage of the competition. Real Madrid were knocked out at the semi-final stage as well, to eventual winners Bayern Munich. </p>
      <p>Solari’s comments may have just been a passing conversation sidenote, however, Leeds should certainly keep him in mind going forward. </p>

      <p>Marcelo Bielsa is an extremely popular coach at Elland Road but Leeds United fans realise his time in West Yorkshire is limited. He looks set to be signing deals on a one-year basis and if Leeds fail to win promotion this season it is hard to see the Argentine sticking around for another term.</p>
      <p>Solari shares a similar ethos to Bielsa, he would be a marquee appointment and is even known to the Leeds boss. Solari played for Bielsa during the latter’s time as Argentina’s national boss. Although, saying that, Solari was not a regular call-up for Bielsa.</p>
      <p>But Leeds do need to start planning for life after Bielsa and a big-name appointment like Solari would certainly catch the eye. </p>
