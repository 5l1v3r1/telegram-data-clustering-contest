      <h1>LaMonica Garrett Reveals How Comics-Accurate His Anti-Monitor Is</h1>

      <p>The Anti-Monitor will make his Arrowverse debut on the upcoming "<a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths/">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>" crossover special. Recently, his portrayer, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/crisis-infinite-earths-lamonica-garrett-anti-monitor-interview/">LaMonica Garrett, spoke to CBR</a> and discussed just how comics accurate this version of the Anti-Monitor is.</p>
      <p>According to Garrett, fans can expect his Anti-Monitor to be quite comics accurate --for the New 52 take on the character at least.</p>
      <p>Garrett told CBR, "It's hard to adapt everything from page to screen, especially something [with] the stakes that... <i>Crisis on Infinite Earths</i> [had] in the comic book, but they brought a lot of that to the page," said Garrett. "With that came a lot of who the Anti-Monitor was and what he wanted. I think it's very similar, aside from the fact that -- and he could still very well have it -- but the exact appearance as the Anti-Monitor from the comic book. They did more of a New 52 Anti-Monitor, from the <i>Darkseid Wars</i>. So, aside from that, I think it's pretty spot on."</p>

      <p><a href="https://screenrant.com/arrow-crisis-anti-monitor-laurel-black-siren-theory/">Garrett also spoke about the Anti-Monitor's</a> relationship with his brother, the Monitor, who he has portrayed since last year's crossover, "Elseworlds." According to him, the dichotomy between the two characters was another reason behind the choice of the New 52-inspired design over the classic one.</p>
      <p>Garrett replied, "You know, people want the big helmet and the big android-looking machine that was in the original comic book. But I think the fact that they really played up that these two do mirror each other, these two are like brothers." he added, "They're exactly the same, except the positive matter universe and the anti-matter, you know what I mean? So I think just having both of them, you know, even clothes they're wearing -- like they have similar garments, just different colors: darker and lighter and more colorful. But it's like these two do mirror each other and playing both of them, it was a trip."</p>
      <p>"Crisis on Infinite Earths" begins Sunday, Dec. 8 and 8 p.m. ET/PT on <i>Supergirl</i>, then continues in <i>Batwoman</i> on Monday, Dec. p at 8 p.m. ET/PT and in <i>The Flash</i> on Tuesday, Dec, 10 at 8 p.m. ET/PT.
