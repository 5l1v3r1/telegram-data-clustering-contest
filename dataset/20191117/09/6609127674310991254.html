        <b>I THOUGHT I’d seen some bad man management in my time and then England boss Gareth Southgate rides into town and steals the show.</b>
      </p>
      <p>His pandering to the snowflake generation over the Raheem Sterling incident last week left me shaking my head in disbelief.</p>

      <p>Everything Southgate could have done wrong in the aftermath of the Man City player’s bust-up with Liverpool defender Joe Gomez, he did wrong.</p>
      <p>Hours after the pair clashed in their top-of-the-table EPL clash, they had afters in the canteen on England international duty — resulting in Sterling getting Gomez in a headlock.</p>
      <p>Over in seconds, the pair were pulled apart by their teammates — and that should have been the end of it.</p>
      <p>The gaffer should have dealt with the matter privately, a heavy fine and a dressing down. End of.</p>
      <p>But instead he made the matter ten times worse, by dropping Sterling and calling a press conference.</p>
      <p>And I’m not the first to make the point that if England had been playing a more important match against a top team, there’s no way Southgate would have dropped his best player.</p>
      <p>Sterling, who used to play for Liverpool, had been getting it tight from Reds supporters all game and Gomez was clearly at the wind-up.</p>
      <p>The lad snapped, but was quick to apologise for his actions. Even Gomez wanted to forget about it and move on.</p>
      <p>This was an opportunity for Southgate to be calm and authoritative without over-reacting. But instead he made a meal of it and that’s all anyone talked about in the build-up to an historic night for England, as they played their 1,000th international match.</p>
      <p>When Southgate took the decision to address the matter and reveal he was dropping Sterling, he should have gone the whole way and explained exactly what went on, because people were left guessing.</p>
      <p>As a result, Gomez ended up being booed by England fans when he came on as a sub against Montenegro as fans jumped to the wrong conclusion that he was as much to blame as Sterling.</p>
      <p>In other words, he was chucked under a bus.</p>
      <p>Southgate came out later and slaughtered the boo boys, but that was too late.</p>

      <p>My God, you’d think Southgate had never played professional football in his life, if he thinks a scrap between a couple of teammates is such a big deal.</p>
      <p>The problem is he’s been sucked into the world of the easily-offended and felt he needed to escalate matters in public rather than dealing with it behind closed doors.</p>
      <p>If he was asked about it at a press conference, all he needed to say was: “I’m the England manager. I’ve dealt with this matter appropriately and we move on. Next question.”</p>
      <p>I know I’ve told you before about my two Celtic teammates from our great double winning centenary side of 1988, Tommy Burns and Mick McCarthy.</p>
      <p>Tam, God rest his soul, and big Mick were born winners, the most passionate guys you could meet.</p>
      <p>But when they disagreed, wow, you had to get out the way quick.</p>
      <p>I lost count of the number of times they were at each other’s throats or had to be pulled apart.</p>
      <p>Winning meant everything to them and they weren’t slow in letting others around them know if they weren’t pulling their weight.</p>
      <p>Passions usually run high when winners are involved and that’s just part and parcel of football.</p>
      <p>That might explain why England haven’t won anything under Southgate, despite having two opportunities to reach finals in the last couple of years.</p>
      <p>If he had the leadership skills of a born winner, he would have dealt with that matter in-house and moved on. I’m certain of that.</p>
      <p>And he would have known he had a couple of players who are so passionate, so determined to come out on top, they were momentarily blinded by rage.</p>
      <p>Is that a negative in professional sport? I don’t think so.</p>
      <h3>Big man tamed his Fury</h3>
      <p>LISTENING to Tyson Fury on the radio the other morning, I was struck by how great he sounded.</p>
      <p>But I’d no idea just how dark a place the former World boxing champion found himself in a few years back.</p>
      <p>He opened up about experiencing severe mental health issues, which resulted in him contemplating taking his own life.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>I’ll be honest, I wasn’t his biggest fan back then and didn’t like how he behaved.</p>
      <p>Unbeknown to me, of course, he was badly hit by depression shortly after becoming champion and added to that, he slumped into a world of alcohol and dug addiction.</p>
      <p>He revealed on TalkSport how he’d had his mind set on taking his own life, until he heard a “voice” in his head that said: “Don’t do this, think about your kids and your family, you’re going to destroy so many lives.”</p>
      <p>That was the first time he realised he couldn’t survive like this anymore and he couldn’t put himself through more mental torture.</p>
      <p>It’s great to see he has turned a corner and all the nonsense, including the bigoted comments, are a thing of the past.</p>
      <p>Now the 31-year-old has turned his life around and says he can finally be himself and he is calling on men to speak up about their mental health, which is important.</p>
      <p>His new autobiography, Behind the Mask, could be a valuable present in someone’s Christmas stocking.</p>
      <p>IF I’m not here next week, it’s because I’ve been signed up by Broadway after my singing and dancing nearly broke the internet.</p>
      <p>In case you’ve been living in a cave, I’m starring in the video for the new single by Clydebank band The Ronains, called Funtime Frankie.</p>

      <p>I dusted off the fancy footwork that once graced nightclubs the length and breadth of Britain — I’ve still got it.</p>
      <p>The video was premiered at a sold-out GMAC Theatre in Glasgow during the week.</p>
      <p>It was a poignant moment for the band as they remembered former guitarist and vocalist Shaun Scott. He passed away in August just 10 days before the band were due to release their new song. A cracking guy who is sadly missed.</p>

      <p>She looked at home as she showed up in a flashy white Lamborghini with the number plate “IAC 2019” to film the opening episode of the down under reality show I’m a Celebrity, which kicks off tonight.</p>
      <p>This year’s show could produce some amazing telly and it’s great to see Ant and Dec back together doing what they do best.</p>
      <p>Bring it on.</p>
