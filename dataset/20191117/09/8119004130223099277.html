        <b>A Bangladeshi expatriate has been arrested in South Africa on charges of kidnapping a fellow countryman, according to police.</b>
      </p>
      <p>South African police contacted their Bangladeshi counterparts after rescuing the victim -- Mohammad Abdullah Al Reza, 24, a native of Chattogram.</p>
      <p>Gunmen abducted Reza, who works in his cousin's shop in Pretoria's Tweefontoein, on Oct 31.</p>
      <p>Chattogram Counter Terrorism Police Deputy Commissioner Md Shahidullah said law enforcement in South Africa rescued Reza last week after his cousin Md Farhad initiated a case through the Bangladesh embassy there.</p>
      <p>Law enforcers subsequently arrested Aminul Haque, 35, who hails from Feni, along with his Pakistani accomplice to the crime, said Shahidullah.</p>
      <p>After the kidnappers demanded a ransom of Tk 5 million, Reza’s family paid Tk 100,000 to an account in a Bangladeshi bank, the police officer said.</p>
      <p>The account belongs to a relative of Aminul in Bangladesh but the relative was unaware of his misdeeds.</p>
      <p>South African police also identified some other members of Aminul’s 'gang', which allegedly includes other Bangladeshis, and have launched efforts to apprehend them, according to Shahidullah.</p>
