      <p>A Cadbury product is this week being recalled by its parent company Mondelez UK over safety concerns.</p>
      <p>The issue concerns some packs of Dairy Milk Little Robins (93g) which contain undeclared almonds and are therefore a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy to nuts.</p>
      <p>The FSA have revealed the labelling error is due to some of the product having been incorrectly packed with Cadbury Dairy Milk Little Robins Daim Chocolate.</p>
      <p>The affected items have the batch codes of CIS3092812 and CIS3092822, and have a best before date of March 31, 2020.</p>
      <p>Little Robins products are currently sold at stores including Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda.</p>
      <h3>Waitrose</h3>
      <p>Pots &amp; Co. is recalling part of its range of products, which are currently stocked at Waitrose &amp; Partners.</p>
      <p>The manufacturer recently explained that four of its pot varieties may contain pieces of glass, and are therefore unsafe for consumption.</p>
      <p>Colombian Chocolate Pot (65g) which has the identifying barcode of 5060253701920.</p>
      <p>Mango &amp; Passionfruit Pot (65g) which has the identifying barcode of 5060253701906.</p>
      <p>Mango &amp; Passionfruit Pot (6x65g) which has the identifying barcode of 5060253702224.</p>
      <p>Summer Berry Pot (65g) which has the identifying barcode of 5060253701913</p>
      <p>The affected products are those with dates codes up to and including November 23, 2019.</p>
      <h3>Argos</h3>
      <p>The final recall of the week concerns retailer Argos, which has told customers to return its Argos Memory Foam Mattress Topper.</p>
      <p>A "small number" of this product do not conform to UK fire safety standards and therefore pose a risk to those using them.</p>
      <p>The issue was identified during routine testing by the company, who are urging customers to stop using the product immediately.</p>
      <p>There are four affected varieties of matter toppers involved in the current recall, each with identifying batch codes.</p>
