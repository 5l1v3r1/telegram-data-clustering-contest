      <p>“With AFCON qualifiers taking a 10-month break until next September, this Sudan game is our utmost focus right now and as the cliché in football says, the next game is the most important one," said Jordaan, as quoted on SAFA’s official website. </p>
      <p>"Sudan is one of the oldest teams in Africa. They were the hosts and one of three participants in the first ever AFCON Finals in 1957 and they also lifted the continental trophy in 1970.</p>
      <p>"More recently they reached the AFCON quarter-finals in 2012 but have not qualified for any of the four tournaments since then." </p>
