      <h2>The Essex businessman is back in football and promising to do things differently after an unsavoury ending at Billericay Town</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T09:36:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 09:36</time> by <a rel="author">Alan Smith</a></address>
      <p>It is approaching 1pm at the Brentwood Arena and Glenn Tamplin, suited and booted for his first game in charge of Romford, is sending a dozen players home, telling them to find new clubs.</p>
      <p>There are more than two hours to go before the Isthmian North Division’s basement team kick off against Coggeshall Town – in truth, the match is still not certain to go ahead because the referee is yet to inspect a sodden surface – but some players have turned up late.</p>
      <p>If there is one thing that their new owner and manager will not tolerate it is tardiness. “I explained to the players that on time for me is half an hour early,” he says.</p>
      <p>A few minutes later Coggeshall, who are backed by Olly Murs and until last week considered the league’s well-heeled outfit, arrive with no idea of what to expect. Five days ago the promotion hopefuls were preparing for a game against the division’s worst team.</p>
      <p>Now, after what Tamplin calls “a week of chaos” in which he bought a cash-strapped and homeless eighth-tier club, immediately sacked the long-serving manager and brought in a whole new squad, not even the players who do get to pull on Romford’s blue and gold shirt are sure of what will unfold.</p>
      <p>All but one have had a single training session, three are turning up for the first time on matchday. Of the 12 sent home, three were going to be in the starting XI but they have been bluntly told to find new clubs.</p>
      <p>“It’s weakened the team but I’m a man of morals,” Tamplin tells <b>football.london</b> a short while after they are sent packing. “I don't like barking, I like biting. I bark once and then I bite. First time shame on you, second time shame on me.”</p>
      <p>—</p>
      <p>This time he promises it will be different.</p>
      <p>When Tamplin, a 47-year-old businessman who made his money in steel, bought Billericay Town in December 2016, his heavy investment took non-league by storm.</p>
      <p>The ground was renovated, featuring infamous gaudy murals outside and inside the dressing rooms; a trio of players with Premier League experience, Jamie O’Hara, Jermaine Pennant and Paul Konchescky, were brought in as the club sought to climb the ladder in a hurry; and at one point Tamplin needed to take out bridging loans to keep paying the £30,000-a-week wage bill.</p>
      <p>He also became the club’s manager, won a treble and qualified for the FA Cup first round. He sacked himself following three defeats in a row and, as a result, an argument with his players regarding them giving up a week’s pay. After 48 hours, he changed his mind and was rehired.</p>
      <p>In total he spent about £3,000,000 before walking away in September because he could no longer take the abuse directed at his family from supporters.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“It worked at Billericay but it cost me too much money and I ended up getting bridging loans,” he says. “No one knows what I did to keep that club going. I'll do it differently now because I'm getting players in on loan.</p>
      <p>“At Billericay I was spending £25,000 to £30,000 a week on wages. At this level I'm only spending £3,000. Billericay was only one league higher than this and I was spending £30,000 a week. I would never do that again because I nearly went skint.</p>
      <p>“I've learnt it's not about buying players. It's about relationships, loaning players in and becoming a team rather than individuals.</p>
      <p>“Billericay was never a circus – they did the treble in the first year and you can't call that a circus. I get what they said in the media about bringing well-known players in but Paul Konchesky, Jermaine Pennant and Jamie O'Hara were fantastic for the club.</p>
      <p>“They had a great attitude, great morals. And the players who caused problems were the non-league players who thought they were Premier League players. The Premier League players were amazing.”</p>
      <p>Much of the abuse that precipitated his departure related to his teenage son Archie being part of the squad. Accusations of nepotism did not rest easily with Tamplin, who felt he was there on merit. It was painful to cut ties but the abuse “crossed the line” and was having a negative impact on his health.</p>
      <p>So why get back on the horse at Romford? “I went into football to build a club and a community and get into the Football League,” he says. “I built a club and a community in Billericay but I left prematurely because of what went on. I haven't fulfilled my ambitions. I don't start things to not finish them. I can't look in the mirror at the moment because I haven't fulfilled my ambitions.”</p>
      <p>He might do things differently at Romford but all the early evidence suggests orthodoxy is not part of the masterplan.</p>
      <p>Late Tuesday morning it was announced that Tamplin had invested in the club. According to a statement on their website his arrival would “secure both the club’s short-term and long-term future.”</p>
      <p>By 7pm that evening Tamplin had installed himself as manager, with Paul “Magic” Martin departing after 13 years of service. “We appreciate this is a lot of information for supporters to take in at the moment,” read a second mildly-understated statement confirming Martin’s departure.</p>
      <p>Two and a half hours later Tamplin announced on his Twitter feed that the club had signed 15 new players. Among the new faces is Freddie Moncur, the son of former West Ham midfielder John, and Phil Roberts, an Arsenal academy graduate who played underage for Ireland before embarking on a non-league odyssey.</p>
      <p>No one of O’Hara, Pennant or Konchesky’s quality has been snapped up yet – but give it time. Four new faces are expected to be loaned in from National League clubs in the next few days as Romford first seek to climb above the relegation place before, Tamplin insists, aiming for the play-offs come May.</p>
      <p>That would require a lengthy winning run. Thirteen games into the campaign they are 16 points off fifth, although only three from safety.</p>
      <p>—</p>
      <p>It is clear from the time that <b>football.london</b> spends in Tamplin’s company that he is a complex character. There is more to him than the maverick caricature that formed during his time at Billericay.</p>
      <p>That image was at least partially self-inflicted – the murals at New Lodge, the social media presence, the videos of him singing R Kelly in the changing room and, of course, the heavy spending – but underneath the flashy exterior there is a “genuine, honest man.”</p>
      <p>At one point during our pre-match chat Tamplin says that he can feel “a good energy between us” before transitioning into an explanation of why he <i>really</i> needs football.</p>
      <p>“For me to stay well, because I am an addict, I have to have hobbies and be busy,” he says. “If I'm bored things can creep back in. What I'm doing this time is being much more humble, much more honest – even if people don't want to hear the truth.”</p>
      <p>But what does he make of the perception that has developed in the past three years?</p>
      <p>“Find someone that knows me and has a bad word to say about me,” he adds. “I'll put that out there now. I'm a very respectful human being. Just because I have some types of clothes, cars or watches, people have to understand the darkness I've been in as well.</p>
      <p>“From childhood to being in mental homes. I spent 12 weeks in a psychiatric ward. I've been in the darkness. People don't realise that I am genuine, I am real. I walked away from a football club that I put £3million into and left them sustainable, like I promised, and it's a club that is very well known now at non-league. And I walked away from it.</p>
      <p>"I'm just a genuine man but I get judged because of how I dress, how I look. I back myself – I'm not arrogant I'm just confident. If I'm not confident in me, who else is going to be.”</p>
      <p>—</p>
      <p>For the Romford regulars – yes, some do exist – there is excitement but also uncertainty as their unrecognisable team emerge from the tunnel a couple of minutes before 3pm. Just 82 people attended the last home game, a 3-3 draw with Soham Town Rangers, but on a teeth-chattering afternoon 524 turn up at Brentwood’s ground, which they are renting for now, to witness the start of a new era.</p>
      <p>Tamplin was given permission by the league to allow free entry and he offered everyone a free pint in the clubhouse. “I can't make people come,” he says. “A free drink and free entry is probably worth about £12. It's not like I'm giving them life-changing money.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>If there is one negative to be taken from the whirlwind arrival it was the collateral damage that came with it. Telling the players that their services were no longer required was “not tricky because I didn’t know them” but letting Martin and his assistant Mark Lord go was difficult.</p>
      <p>Yet it was also a necessity.</p>
      <p>“I respect them highly, have a lot of time for them,” Tamplin says. “But I'm only getting players offered on loan if I am managing them and looking after them. There are managers in the National League who I have relationships with and they are saying that I can have players but only if I'm in the dugout.</p>
      <p>“I've got an £8,000 squad but it's costing me only £3,000 because I've got players on loan who are costing me £100 and are being paid at clubs like Dartford or Bromley and other clubs.</p>
      <p>“Magic was amazing on the budget and is a big loss to Romford. I wish there was another side we could get him to manage but if we're to go to the Football League we need players from levels above to come in and do it.”</p>
      <p>The conversation drifts back to his critics. In the past he has ended up in trouble for firing back at snipes online but he has since learnt, mostly from his close friend and reality TV personality Mark Wright, how to tune out “the haters.”</p>
      <p>“If you’re concentrating on someone else, not yourself, you've got a problem,” he says. “I see them as sick people. I understand I was sick, an addict, and I was very ill but that's made me good at fixing others because I didn't want to concentrate on myself. If someone is concentrating on abusing me without knowing me, they are sick.</p>
      <p>“I'm a believer and I won't go as far as praying for them but I will say ‘Dear Lord, give me the strength to ignore these people because they are sick individuals’.”</p>
      <p>—</p>
      <p>The game itself is entertaining, defying a heavy pitch that required plenty of TLC earlier in the day. Only one of the players who featured in Romford’s previous game, a 5-1 defeat away to Heybridge Swifts, is part of the matchday 16 against Coggeshall - Malaki Toussaint, who comes off the bench after half an hour.</p>
      <p>Roberts, one of the last-minute additions, scores a stunning goal to put Romford in front after ten minutes. The 25-year-old has had a nomadic career since leaving Arsenal in 2012, Romford becoming his 12th club since.</p>

      <p>Defensively Romford look uncertain and by the 34th minute they are 3-1 down and a small gaggle of Coggeshall fans to the right of the basic, homely stand take great delight in singing that Tamplin would be “sacked in the morning.”</p>
      <p>Romford’s three substitutes have been made by the start of the second half and they put up a decent fight after the break, with a fine Moncur goal making it 3-2 before the hour mark.</p>
      <p>Coggeshall, though, perform with greater cohesion and miss a number of good chances to put the game to bed, leaving Murs evidently frustrated and eventually relieved in the away dugout.</p>
      <p>—</p>
      <p>Now the first game is out of the way, Tamplin’s real work gets underway. Despite Saturday’s performance offering some signs of promise, he believes that it will take five games for the individuals to become a team. “There are also another six coming in that are very big names,” he says, refusing to give any hints. “You’ll have to wait and see.”</p>
      <p>Beyond that he is promising to bring the club home to Romford in the next 18 months, building a stadium from scratch, while making it a key part of the community. “I live in an RM postcode, 20 minutes from the town centre, so I have that connection,” he says.</p>
      <p>He describes making the club something the area can be proud of again as his “greatest challenge” and the only thing he wants to be judged on is how it grows under his ownership.</p>
      <p>“It's not about Glenn Tamplin, it's about Romford FC and the community,” he says. “Sit back and enjoy. This club is going places. We're building a new stadium, this is a team that will go up the leagues. It's a new beginning.”</p>
