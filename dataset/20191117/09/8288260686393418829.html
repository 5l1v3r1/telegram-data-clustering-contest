      <p>Robert Preston, who is currently in a relationship with both Vicki and Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh), will see his luck expire.</p>

      <p>"So apparently Robert Preston will be shot and killed on Christmas Day! Bring on #Corrie," tweeted one fan.</p>
      <p>Michelle is now plotting revenge against Robert after she found out that he had a secret other fiancee, Vicky Jefferies who is pregnant with his baby.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Fans previously assumed that Robert and Michelle would leave together, but talk of his sudden death has dispelled this theory.</p>
      <p>Sally Ann Matthews, who plays Rovers Return landlady Jenny Bradley, previously warned that this Christmas on Coronation Street is 'beyond dramatic', <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/coronation-street-set-explosive-christmas-20566463">reports the Daily Star</a> .</p>

      <p>She said: “I’ve just received scripts for Christmas. What I can say is it’s beyond dramatic.</p>
      <p>"It’s big and edge-of-your-seat stuff. It’s not just one story either. There are several big stories happening.”</p>
      <p>And Jennie McAlpine, who plays Fiz Stape, said: “I’ve read the script for Christmas Eve. It’s quite dramatic. I’m not sure if I’ll be getting any turkey this year.</p>
      <p>"Fiz is going to be quite busy!”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Jennie also teased that there might a death.</p>
      <p>She added: “I can’t say if anyone dies. If I told someone that, I’d have to kill them!”</p>
      <p>Coronation Street is also said to be lining up a heartbreaking Christmas storyline for Rita Tanner.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Weatherfield legend will reportedly have another brush with death after she suffers an accident involving a Christmas tree.</p>
      <p>It's claimed that the plot, which is set to highlight the plight of the lonely and elderly over the festive period, will see Rita suffer a fall while attempting to put up some fairy lights.</p>
      <p>It's said that Rita will be left trapped beneath the tree for several days waiting for someone to help after it falls on top of her.</p>
