      <p>Scotstoun Primary head Gill Mackay cut links with the Kirk preacher saying the posts could cause “potential damage to the education of our children”.</p>
      <p>And dad Hugh Jarvis, 44, added: “Cameron does not belong in a pulpit.</p>
      <p>"I certainly don’t want him providing moral guidance to my kids — and I’m glad he won’t be.</p>
      <p>“The school and BB have handled it well by ditching him immediately.</p>
      <p>“They weren’t to know he sends racist, homophobic tweets in his spare time.”</p>

      <p>We told how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4948785/labour-jeremy-corbyn-terrorist-sympathiser-church-minster-heckle/">the Labour leader looked stunned</a> as he was interrupted.</p>
      <p>The minister shouted: “Do you think the man that’s going to be prime minister of this country should be a terrorist sympathiser?</p>
      <p>“Who’s going to be the first terrorist to be invited to the House of Commons when you’re prime minister?”</p>
      <p>As Mr Corbyn showed off a tartan scarf gifted to him by a charity, Rev Cameron then asked why he wasn't wearing an "Islamic jihad scarf".</p>
      <p>The Labour chief did not respond and was ushered away by aides, prompting the minister to shout: “Aye you’re running away.”</p>
      <p>A Church of Scotland spokesperson said: “In accordance with our procedures Rev Richard Cameron has been administratively suspended.</p>
      <p>"This is to allow us to carry out an enquiry in relation to the incident which took place earlier this week and the subsequent complaints about his social media use."</p>
      <p>The churchman was unavailable for comment.</p>
      <p>We also told how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4953338/jeremy-corbyn-independence-labour-dundee-heckler/">Mr Corbyn was heckled by a "pro-independence supporter"</a> at a separate event in Dundee during his visit north of the border.</p>
      <p>The opposition leader struggled to speak over the vocal heckler, who told security at the event to “take your hands off me”.</p>
