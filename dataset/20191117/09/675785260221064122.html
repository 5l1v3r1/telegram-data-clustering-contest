      <p>Actor Stephen Graham has said his future wife came into his life after a suicide attempt - which "thankfully" failed.</p>
      <p>The This Is England star said it was "worth living" following an attempt to take his own life during a period of despair in his early 20s.</p>
      <p>Graham tried to hide the marks of his hanging attempt with high-collar jumpers before the truth of his suicide bid came out.</p>
      <p>Following the traumatic low point, the versatile star of Boardwalk Empire and Line Of Duty was supported by his future wife Hannah Walters.</p>

      <p>Speaking on Radio Four's Desert Island Discs, the actor said they moved in together in south London after what was technically their first date.</p>
      <p>Graham's time in the capital before this was marked by despair. He said: "I had a breakdown. Going to that big London to do it on your own.</p>
      <p>"Then I went back home. They [his parents] were trying to see what was happening with me.</p>
      <p>"I'll never forget the tears coming down both their faces.</p>
      <p>"Then the next day I tried to hang myself. It was very calculated.</p>

      <p>"I heard my Nana's voice. She shouted 'Stephen' and I thought I'd gone. I just came to, opened my eyes.</p>
      <p>"I had to put on a high neck jumper. My mum kind of saw it. Then everything came out. Life was worth living, thankfully."</p>
      <p>Graham said that in the aftermath of his attempt, his friends and family rallied round.</p>
      <p>Tearfully talking on the Radio Four show, he also credited the help of his future wife.</p>
      <p>He said: "This is kind of where Hannah came into my life properly.</p>
      <p>"She knew what had happened. She was always in close contact with my mum."</p>

      <p>Graham said that after a long period of "just talking" they had not been on a proper date, something he eventually remedied when she was due to move to Spain.</p>
      <p>He recalled: "We were waiting at New Cross train station and I said to her, 'please don't go to Spain. I love you".</p>
      <p>"She went, 'I've been waiting for five years for you to say that'. The next day we moved in together."</p>
      <p>The mixed-race actor said he suffered racist abuse on the streets of Liverpool, which his mother quickly put a stop to. He also revealed he was unsure of his place in the world as a mixed-race child.</p>
      <p>He said: "I'm mixed race and that was kind of frowned up in those days.</p>
      <p>"There were times growing up when I was slightly unsure where I fitted in.</p>
      <p>"That n-word popped up when I was younger."</p>
      <p>Graham has recently starred in the new Martin Scorsese crime film The Irishman alongside his acting hero Robert De Niro.</p>
      <p>The full interview with Graham can be heard on Desert Island Discs today at 11.15am.</p>
