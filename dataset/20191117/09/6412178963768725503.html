      <h3>PSG KEEN ON ADAM LALLANA</h3>
      <p>Paris Saint-Germain are eyeing up a potential swoop for Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana, according to reports.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/adam-lallana"><b>The 31-year-old</b></a> enjoyed a fruitful first few years working alongside Reds boss Jurgen Klopp but has been pushed out in recent seasons and is now on the fringes of the squad.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-midfielder-adam-lallana-psgs-20896197"><b>Sunday</b><b> Mirror</b></a>, PSG have him in their sights as a potential replacement for Edinson Cavani, who is reportedly closing in on a move to the MLS with LA Galaxy to fill the outgoing Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s shoes.</p>
      <p>The newspaper adds that with Lallana’s contract at Anfield expiring next summer, the French champions will be free to tempt Lallana with a bumper wage package given that he will be a free agent.</p>
      <p>The Mirror continues by saying that <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/liverpool"><b>the Reds</b></a> could use the £7m a season they would free up from his sale to fund a move for Bournemouth’s Ryan Fraser, who has been linked with a move to Merseyside in the past week.</p>
