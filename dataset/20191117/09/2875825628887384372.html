      <p>"Terry was a class act, quick-witted and filled with charm. Anyone who was lucky enough to know or work with him can attest to his generosity and modesty.</p>
      <p>"As one of the most iconic photographers of the last 60 years, his legendary pictures will forever remain imprinted in our memories as well as in our hearts and minds."</p>
      <p>Terry himself spoke of pride in his decades of photography, revealing how a lucky break while working for British Overseas Airways Corporation got him to fame.</p>

      <p>"Part of my work was to take photographs of people arriving and departing at the terminals. I happened upon a very well-dressed bowler-hatted man, taking a quick nap in the departures area, and he was surrounded by African chieftains, fully clad in their regalia.</p>
      <p>"Soon after, I was approached by an editor who told me that they wanted to show the photo to his paper. The man napping turned out to be then Home Secretary Rab Butler. The paper ran my photo and I was off and running. I was offered a job at the Daily Sketch where I worked for several years before going out on my own.</p>
