      <p>Back in September <a href="https://ausdroid.net/2019/09/06/lenovos-new-smart-display-7-has-a-smaller-footprint-but-the-same-big-speakers/">Lenovo announced</a> their next Google Assistant powered smart speaker, the Smart Display 7 with Google Assistant. The device has quietly made its way to our shores, listed for sale in Australia for $129.</p>
      <p>You’ll find listings for the Smart Display 7 at <a href="https://www.harveynorman.com.au/lenovo-smart-display-7-with-the-google-assistant.html">Harvey Norman</a>, <a href="https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/lenovo-smart-display-7-with-the-google-assistant">JB Hi-fi</a> and <a href="https://www.thegoodguys.com.au/lenovo-smart-display-7-with-google-assistant-za5k0001au">The Good Guys</a> list the device on their sites, with The Good Guys even marking is as in stock in some locations.</p>
      <p>For those looking for a little more, the latest Harvey Norman catalogue has the 7-inch Smart Display along with a Lenovo Smart Plug and Colour Changing Bulb (both of which work with Google Assistant) for just $147 – that’s not a bad deal!</p>

      <p>If you’ve been looking for a smart display, this new Lenovo sounds like a good deal – it’s much cheaper than Google’s own 7-inch offering (Nest Hub) and includes a camera for Duo calling.</p>
