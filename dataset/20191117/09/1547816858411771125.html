      <p>On Friday Parineeti Chopra taking to her Instagram account, informed of an <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/bad-news-shoot-of-saina-nehwal-comes-to-a-halt-following-parineeti-chopra-s-nape-injury/5dceba2987fb571eff7e3ef4">unfortunate injury, she suffered while shooting for Saina Nehwal biopic</a>. Accompanying this post was an image of the actress seated facing her back to the camera, with a bandage on her nape. Now the actress has once again taken to her Insta, to share how she has begun her recovery journey. Just like her previous post, her fans and industry colleagues, prayed for her speedy recovery. For example, after singer Amaal Malik, singer Guru Randhawa too commented on her post.  <br/><br/>In the video shared by Parineeti, we can see her lying, while her physiotherapist makes her do some light leg exercises. In the caption, she mentioned about beginning her recovery journey, and thanked her physiotherapist. Her caption read, “Recovery Day 1. My whole body is stiff and tight Thanks my physiotherapist Apoorva for taking care of me” In the actress’ previous post, along with her injury, she informed of how despite several measures taken by the crew, she ended up with this unfortunate injury, ultimately slowing down the process of the shoot.

      <p>She was quoted saying, “I had made a lot of money by then, but I had bought a house and I had made some big investments. Then I went through a big heartbreak in my life. Literally, all the departments in my life were down. Nothing positive to look forward to."</p>
