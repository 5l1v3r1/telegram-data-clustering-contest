      <p>Prithvi Shaw, who returned to the cricket field after an eight-month suspension, smashed 63 runs off 39 balls against Assam in <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/syed-mushtaq-ali-trophy-meghalaya-shock-mumbai-haryana-bengal-pondicherry-register-wins-2133257">Syed Mushtaq Ali trophy</a> match at Wankhede stadium on Sunday. Prithvi Shaw was playing his first match after he was banned by the BCCI for inadvertently ingesting a prohibited substance, which can be commonly found in cough syrups. After going reaching his half-century, Shaw made a gesture towards the stands, signalling that he will let his bat do the talking.</p>
      <p>The young opening batsman hit seven fours and two maximums en route his fifth half-century in Twenty20 cricket.Â </p>
      <p>BCCI Domestic's official Twitter handle posted a video where the young opening batsman can be seen celebrating his half-century.</p>

      <p>Soon after the video was posted on Twitter, fans vented their anger at <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/prithvi-shaw-promises-a-better-version-of-himself-going-forward-on-20th-birthday-2130002">Prithvi Shaw</a> for his "over confident gesture".</p>
      <p>"This is the problem with the young players. Coming Back from a ban, scoring a half century against a relatively weaker bowling attack, and then making gestures. They need to learn to be humble. This over confident kid won't last long in the international arena. MARK MY WORDS," a fan tweeted.</p>

      <p>"Against Asam and attitude omg. Definitely got many ducks in international while making a comeback. When bat speak no need to tell anything by mouth," another fan joined in.</p>

      <p>"Shaw is so overrated. Shaw is the next Kambli. He will throw it away with this kind of poor attitude and arrogance," a fan compared Shaw with Vinod Kambli.</p>

      <p>In the match, Mumbai were put into bat by Assam who had won the toss.</p>
      <p>Apart from Shaw and Tare, a quick-fire 32 from Siddesh Lad towards the end helped Mumbai post 206 for five in their 20 overs.</p>
      <p>Assam, in reply, could only manage 123 for eight from their 20 overs as Mumbai took four crucial points from their last group stage fixture.</p>
