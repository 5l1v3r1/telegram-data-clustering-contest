      <p>Dani Olmo scored on his Spain debut on Friday as his stock continues to rise. He was linked with a move away from Dinamo Zagreb in the summer but nothing materialised.</p>
      <p>However, there will be more rumours in January, with his club coach recently suggesting he will leave in the winter. He came through at Barcelona's La Masia and the Catalan club may be one of those tempted to take a punt on the forward.</p>
      <p>Olmo spoke exclusively with SPORT from the Spain camp about his future:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Is the next step to return to the Spanish league?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I hope I can come back, but we've just started the season really well, we're doing well in the Champions League. There are two games left and we depend on ourselves to get through. There's a lot of work to be done.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Robert Moreno said the Champions League has proven you as a player...</b>
      </p>
      <p>Probably. The Champions League is a shop window for all young players, especially if you're in a smaller league like Croatia.</p>
      <p>
        <b>And with your performances in Europe, Barça have been linked again&amp;mldr;</b>
      </p>
      <p>We will see what happens...</p>
      <p>
        <b>You have always said the door is open...</b>
      </p>
      <p>I don't close the door on any club, but I'm a Dinamo player, what happens with Dinamo, we will see.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What stays with you from your time at La Masia?</b>
      </p>
      <p>With what you learn, the values you are taught. Also Barcelona's style: touch, movement. That's added to what I have learned in Croatia, they've made me the player I am now.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What's been added in Croatia?</b>
      </p>
      <p>More physical play, box to box, as they call it in England. The style is more direct. Thank's to that I am a little more direct and not so conservative.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What's your preferred position?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Just behind the forward. I like to get into good areas and shoot. I try to shoot from distance.</p>
