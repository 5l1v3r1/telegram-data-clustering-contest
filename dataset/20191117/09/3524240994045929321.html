        <b>SOLAPE LAWAL-SOLARIN <i>takes a look at African footballers who combine playing football with part-time menial jobs in Qatar’s lower leagues</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>In the search for opportunities that are increasingly getting fewer and hoarded, Nigerian footballers in their hundreds continually migrate from the country to climes hardly identified with a football culture.</p>
      <p>From Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan in Central Asia to India and Vietnam in South Asia, African footballers have shown up in obscure leagues doing what they know how to do best: playing football.</p>
      <p>However, it seems the Gulf, Qatar especially, owing to her oil wealth, is now a turn-on for Nigerian and African players seeking greener pastures.</p>
      <p>“Playing in Qatar is good for me and my career. The facilities I train with, and the organisation here gives me satisfaction,” admits 23-year-old Nigerian footballer, Victor Akah, who plays for Doha United in the second division.</p>
      <p>“I know if I do well in the lower division I can sign on for a topflight club in the country. It is every footballer’s dream to ink that mega deal.”</p>
      <p>Largely considered as a non-footballing nation in past years, times have changed as the tiny gulf country has now become a destination for players like Akah and other Africans who could seal deals in European football.</p>
      <p>But why would a player from a strong football background like Nigeria accept deals in Qatar ranked 55 according to latest FIFA rankings, and more disturbing, in its second-division league?</p>
      <p>For these dream chasers, the lure of getting to sign for one of the top clubs in the country via the lower division looks easy but, then it’s an uphill task many have struggled to accomplish.</p>
      <p>Life in Qatar’s second division is not that rosy, for these footballers chasing that once in a life-time transforming deals.</p>
      <p>Playing in Qatari lower division is not as lucrative as playing in the Star League.</p>
      <p>So how do the Nigerians cope playing in the lower divisions?</p>
      <p>They pick up part-time jobs to meet up with their financial needs.</p>
      <p>Tony Noise, who once starred for former Nigerian champions Ocean Boys player, says Qatar offers huge opportunities hard to come by back home.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the Doha United defender also works part-time with the Qatar Art Center.</p>
      <p>He confessed, “I came to Qatar because of the better opportunities I get as a player. What I earn here in the lower league as salary is far better than what I’ll earn as a footballer in Nigeria. It could be small, but incomparable to what they pay back home. I picked up a job with the art center too, so that I can augment what I earn from football.</p>

      <p>“And I can also get to help my folks back home, which is very important. And besides, they treat you well here with love and respect.”</p>
      <p>For Ghanaian and Al Mater FC midfielder, Abdul Rahim, who also works part-time as a safety officer, life in the lower division is tough for a footballer who has responsibilities.</p>
      <p>“The money in the lower leagues is not comparable to the topflight. But, at least it’s better because if you want to help your people back home, you need extra jobs to make more money. We don’t have that luxury in African football.</p>
      <p>“It is the only way one can easily get on until you’re lucky and a topflight club snaps you up.”</p>
      <p>Aliou Batisol, a Malian and teammate of Abdul Rahim, admits it’s not easy combining football with part-time jobs as it comes with  its challenges.</p>
      <p>He, who hails from Boul City in Bamako, currently works part-time as an electrical engineer in a food processing company.</p>
      <p>“Players in the lower leagues don’t have the luxury their counterparts in the topflight have, hence we try to play all games in the league, Cup and other competitions just to make more money,” Batisol said.</p>
      <p>“But it’s combining playing lots of games with extra jobs.  The timing, the planning and several other factors can affect your output on the pitch if you’re not careful.”</p>
      <p>Pearl FC’s Moroccan striker Mourad Benzarmid, who also doubles as a safety officer, said, “I have embraced reality and have taken up a part-time job and I’m coping. That’s the only way you can earn a decent living here and be self-sufficient.”</p>
      <p>Loads of distractions, however lie in wait for these ambitious players trying to get to the top. While it is a reality that they have come to accept as footballers, confronting the problems associated with playing football and working part-time remains a nightmare for these young men.</p>
      <p>“The combination of job and football has affected my performance on the pitch. Sometimes when I play I notice I’m not sharp and fit enough because of doing another job apart from football,” Batisol stated.</p>
      <p>Benzarmid faces same problem.</p>
      <p>“I no longer have enough time to implement my training programme, it is time consuming and at the end of the day your fitness level suffers,” he said.</p>
      <p>Nigerian Akah added, “It could be mentally and physically tough. After working full hours then coming to the pitch to train, one’s mental and psychological state suffers.</p>
      <p>“Your coach plays you, you don’t do well, you lose matches and it only raises questions. The coach will demand answers.</p>
      <p>“A match is not something you just hit the pitch and play, it takes a considerable level of preparedness and tactical drills. If you are not there because of your part-time job, how will you fit in on match day?”</p>
      <p>Egyptian Amr Sayed, former Doha United coach, who now works with Osman, says the players’ challenges is a reality a coach must deal with, but admits it’s tough coping with players who engage in jobs outside football.</p>
      <p>“It’s not easy, these guys are talented; they’re really good, but working and playing football is not easy. It is something we try to manage in the best possible way,” Sayed said.</p>
      <p>“I have had to contend with players combining football with their part-time jobs. Fitness, shape, diet and organisation can be much more difficult to implement, because players have different demands due to their jobs and you’ve got to understand that as a lower division coach.</p>
      <p>“Really, it can be frustrating sometimes, because it’s difficult to tell them what to eat and when to eat when their shifts are completely different from those starring in the topflight.</p>
      <p>“The situation has forced me to find flexibility around our trainings.”</p>
      <p>Critics are of opinion that the migration of African footballers to climes like Qatar is fueled by monetary instead of footballing reasons, and also a desperate attempt to embellish their football credentials.</p>
      <p>But then, many reasons have been put forward by these African players plying their trade in Qatar’s second division.</p>
      <p>Peculiar problems that have continued to bedevil the game in Africa fueled their desire to seek better fortune elsewhere.</p>
      <p>From corruption to influence of godfathers, poor sporting infrastructure and poor remuneration, these players are unified in their purpose, shared objectives and pursuit of glory.</p>
      <p>Abdul Rahim, who played for Accra Hearts of Oak before joining Al Mater FC in Qatar told SUNDAY PUNCH that extortion and favouritism forced him to seek greener pastures in Qatar.</p>
      <p>He said, “I played in Ghana’s domestic league for Hearts of Oak, but it was limited. I didn’t have money, neither did I have the connections to go far in the game in my homeland.</p>
      <p>“You see administrators asking ‘who is your father?’ or ‘who invited you?’ not minding the qualities and technical skills you possess as a player. So, when the opportunity to join Qatar came, I jumped at it in order to build my career.</p>
      <p>“At least here, your quality and talent as a player would speak for you and I would also benefit from training with standard sports facilities.”</p>
      <p>In a separate chat with our correspondent, Batisol, a former defender with Africa Sports de Gao in Mali, also shared his experience at home before making the long trip to Qatar.</p>
      <p>Batisol said, “I chose Qatar because most of our local clubs back home do not care how good or talented you are. They will ask you how much you can offer before giving you the opportunity to play. In Qatar, we don’t have such problems.</p>
      <p>“If our African administrators don’t work to rectify this situation, talented players will keep leaving the continent to play in any part of the world.”</p>
      <p>Being financially rewarded and improving their standard of living while also assisting family members back home seems to be another main reason for Benzarmid, who shared his experience with SUNDAY PUNCH.</p>
      <p>According to the former AS Achbal Ismaila Meknes FC striker, he left Morocco for Qatar’s Pearl FC because of the better opportunities on offer there.</p>
      <p>“Playing in Qatar has helped me financially. I left in order to make head-way financially and so far, it has been okay. It might not be as much as what players in the topflight earn, but I’m thriving.</p>
      <p>“And, I guess being familiar with the language has also helped my football experience,” he stated.</p>
      <p>It seems Qatar’s quest to host the World Cup has also fueled the arrival of players into her topflight and lower leagues as their training facilities and stadia infrastructure have been upgraded and in most cases rebuilt from the scratch.</p>
      <p>These transformations have been felt not only in the topflight, but also in the lower leagues, Guinean Ibrahim Barry, who plays for Al Thumama in the second division, said.</p>
      <p>Barry, who played for Association Sportive Kaloum in his country before migrating to Qatar, admitted that the training facilities in the Gulf country are incomparable to what he was used to at home.</p>
      <p>“The opportunities to fix myself and concentrate on my career are here.  I am lucky to have trained in some of the facilities here, and it has been quite an exposure for me. The facilities are wonderful.</p>
      <p>“My experience in playing in lower league is not that bad, I just want to keep working hard and become successful in my career.”</p>
      <p>He added, “My brother’s success here in Qatar also motivates me. He plays for Al Duhail, one of the country’s biggest clubs in the Star League.”</p>
      <p>For Noise, besides training in standard facilities and getting to play in some of the new stadia, the lure of meeting some of Europe’s finest clubs like Juventus, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Real Madrid and their players while on pre-season tours, and warm-weather trainings is a strong attraction.</p>
      <p>“You have the opportunity of playing against these big clubs and the Chinese Super League stars when they come for their training camp in mid-season.</p>
      <p>“It is an experience that boosts one’s exposure, self-confidence as a footballer and also pushes you to excel.”</p>
      <p>Life in the lower leagues might be demanding and at times frustrating but, it seems there is always light at the end of the tunnel for these footballers.</p>
      <p>Despite African footballers’ challenges, coach Amr Sayed believes their presence in the Star League and the lower divisions has improved Qatari football.</p>
      <p> “It’s really difficult and also nice experience to coach a lower league but all the same I’m very happy with the quality of African players in my team.</p>
      <p>“I appreciate these players’ strength and determination. Despite the challenges, they are always ready to give their best.</p>
      <p>“Life is all about opportunities. Most of the lower league players can thrive in the topflight.</p>
      <p> “The prospects are there, I have seen a lot of Africans making it to the Star League, securing lucrative deals and even getting national teams’ call-ups.</p>
      <p>“The presence of so many African players in the lower league and topflight has improved Qatari football over the years. Thanks to them and players from other countries, the Star League is more competitive and interesting.”</p>
      <p>Like they say, not all that glitters is gold. The lower divisions in Qatar is not flooded with the petro-dollar sign on fees and salaries that footballers swim in, in the Star League.</p>
      <p>There is a reality check in the lower divisions. To earn the millions, you must work hard and pray that a Star League club snaps you up.</p>
      <p>Akah is aware of this, and has enrolled for a professional course, just in case the journey to the topflight hit the rocks.</p>
      <p> “A move to the topflight is the real deal. It puts an end to all your challenges as a footballer trying to make it financially. However, it’s not easy to get.</p>
      <p>“I just enrolled for some professional courses here. I want to maximise the opportunities; combining my football career with other things. It’s good for my self-development because I need to also plan for my future; life after football,” he stated.</p>
      <p>For Akah, keeping the dream alive remains his priority.</p>
      <p>“I would rather focus on the opportunities than the challenges. Life is all about chances, hopefully I’ll be ready when one comes my way.”</p>
