      <p>A former soldier who became an ISIS bride wants to tell her story in a TV interview when she's flown back to Ireland.</p>
      <p>Lisa Smith, 38, travelled from Ireland to Syria three years ago to join the sadistic terrorist group and has been in the border area between Turkey and Syria with her two year-old daughter in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Smith is set to be arrested as soon as she touches down at Baldonnel Aerodrome, near Dublin in Ireland on Tuesday, according to sources, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/lisa-smith-rte-late-late-20897197">the Irish Mirror reports</a> .</p>
      <p>And she has requested that she has an interview on popular Irish chat show the Late Late Show when she returns to Ireland.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the family, Peter Fitzpatrick said: “They’ve been approached by the Late Late Show and other media all looking for interviews, but Lisa told them she wants to give her own version.”</p>
      <p>Ms Smith, of Dundalk in Co Louth, will face a security assessment and possible prosecution when she returns.</p>

      <p>She was detained in northern Syria in March along with her two-year-old daughter on suspicion of supporting the terror group.</p>
      <p>The family have said they “don’t know what to expect” when she is repatriated from Turkey.</p>
      <p>Mr Fitzpatrick said: “They [Lisa’s family] literally don’t know what is going to happen.</p>
      <p>“They are afraid the child will be taken off her. She has said she will answer any questions whatsoever from gardai [Irish police] or security.</p>
      <p>“The family don’t know what to expect – basically what kind of reception she’s going to get or whether she’ll be arrested.</p>
      <p>“There’s been a lot of speculation but she just wants to come home to her country with her child, she’s very concerned for her child.”</p>
      <p>Lisa is believed to have escaped a detention camp with IS recruiter Tooba Gondal in mid-October and was held in a rebel safehouse on the Turkey-Syria border where she begged to come home.</p>

      <p>The women reportedly walked for miles with their children after fleeing Ain Issa camp when they were picked up by rebel fighters with the Syrian National Army.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year photographs emerged of Ms Smith posing with guns but she claims she has never been a member of the terror group.</p>
      <p>Mr Fitzpatrick said: “There are a lot of rumours about her.</p>
      <p>“She has been in touch with her family, mainly by text. She says she misses home and wants to come home.</p>
      <p>“Her mother has never seen her grandchild and she can’t wait to see the child.</p>
      <p>“There have been threats, yes. The reason the family don’t go public and <br/>talk is they’re afraid they might say something that makes it worse.</p>
      <p>“Lisa has told them when she comes home she will meet the public and give her version of events.</p>
      <p>“They have been approached by RTE, The Late Late and other media all looking for interviews.</p>

      <p>“They want to wait for Lisa to come home and give her version herself.</p>
      <p>“She says she’s innocent, she has an opportunity when she comes home to prove that.”</p>
      <p>Some residents in Dundalk are said to be uneasy about her return, with reports some have written to their local council to express their outrage.</p>
      <p>One source said: “She can’t just rock up as if she did nothing. People are genuinely upset about this.”</p>
      <p>If Smith is repatriated, she will be the first Irish person brought back after joining ISIS.</p>
