      <p>ROSEBURG, Ore. — The cremated remains of more than 20 babies that were found on mortuary shelves in Roseburg, Oregon will be buried Sunday a special ceremony.</p>
      <p>The News-Review reports that the remains were discovered by a woman who was searching for the unclaimed remains of veterans who had not received funerals. A funeral for the 28 veterans whose remains were found in that effort happened earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Some of the infants’ remains have been on a mortuary shelf for up to 70 years.</p>
      <p>Most of the babies are believed to have been stillborn or died within a day of birth.</p>
      <p>Carol Hunt, the woman who found the remains, formed a group called Wings of Love to accomplish the burial project.</p>
      <p>The remains will be interred at Roseburg Memorial Gardens.</p>
