        <b>Australia captain Tim Paine says fast bowler James Pattinson has "let himself down" after being found guilty of his third code of conduct breach of 2019.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It means Pattinson will miss the first Test against Pakistan in Brisbane for disciplinary reasons.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cricket.com.au/news/james-pattinson-suspended-first-test-against-pakistan-code-of-conduct-sheffield-shield-dissent/2019-11-17">Cricket Australia took action</a> after the 29-year-old used abusive language towards an opponent during Victoria's defeat by Queensland last week.</p>
      <p>"I made a mistake in the heat of the moment," said Pattinson.</p>
      <p>"I'm gutted to miss a Test match, but the standards are there for a reason and the fault is mine."</p>
      <p>The exact details of Pattinson's latest offence have not been revealed, but he was found guilty of a level-two breach relating to personal abuse of a player, which was enough to trigger a one-match ban.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the governing body said the bowler "apologised immediately and unreservedly to the opponent and the umpires, and did not contest the charge".</p>
      <p>"He knows he's let himself down," added Paine.</p>
      <p>The first Test starts on Thursday (00:00 GMT), with the concluding match in the two-Test series taking place from 29 November in Adelaide.</p>
