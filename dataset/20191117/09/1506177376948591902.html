      <p>Greece’s 21-year-old tennis star Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Austrian player Dominic Thiem 6-7, 6-2, 6-7 and has won the final of the ATP Finals 2019 in London.</p>
      <p>After becoming the first Greek player to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals, Tsitsipas is now the first player from Greece to lift the trophy at the season finale.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas lost the first set in a close 6-7 tiebreaker, then served incredibly well in the second taking the set 6-2, before another close third set which went to a tie-breaker again, with Tsitsipas taking the match.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas has become the youngest champion at the season finale since 20-year-old Lleyton Hewitt from Australia won in 2001.</p>
      <p>The talented Greek player has now also become the sixth-youngest champion in the tournament’s 50-year history. John McEnroe holds the record for the youngest champion, lifting the trophy in 1978 when he was 19.</p>
      <p>In an interview after beating Roger Federer in the semi-final, Tsitsipas said: “I remember myself being one of these kids here, watching the event, and for me, it was just, I could never picture myself standing here,” said Tsitsipas.</p>
      <p>“But it did happen. Dreams do come true.”</p>
      <p>Bravo Stefanos!</p>
