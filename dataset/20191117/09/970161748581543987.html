      <p>The Apprentice’s Lottie Lion has been slammed by Lubna Farhan for ‘not learning from her mistakes’ after the racism row that threatened her position on the show in a fiery Twitter spat.</p>
      <p>Lottie and Lubna got vicious online after fellow candidate <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/the-apprentices-lottie-lion-and-ryan-mark-tell-fans-they-are-dating-after-romance-rumours-11166557/">Ryan-Mark Parsons egged on the rumour</a> that he was now <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> 19-year-old Lottie.</p>
      <p>When Lubna, who was eliminated three weeks ago, wrote: ‘Lolzz you guys are jokers’, Lottie hit back at the comment and told her: ‘Stop trying to stay relevant.’</p>
      <p>As a result, the flippant comment turned nasty and Lubna responded: ‘You don’t sound like someone who regrets making racist comments. Too bad you don’t learn from your mistakes.</p>
      <p>‘Good luck in your new publicity stunt.’</p>
      <p>The pair definitely have no love lost between them in the aftermath of the show, especially after it emerged that Lottie had sent Lubna ‘racist comments’ in candidates shared group chat.</p>

      <p>Librarian Lottie was investigated by the BBC following the complaints after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/07/apprentice-candidate-lottie-lion-hits-back-racist-accusations-warning-rival-shut-gandhi-10874201/">she told rival Lubna to ‘shut up Gandhi’</a> and threatened to ‘f***ing knock her out’ in a string of vile messages.</p>

      <p>The BBC later told <b>Metro.co.uk:</b> ‘While this happened on a private messenger service once filming had concluded, the BBC nevertheless still expects the candidates to behave appropriately.</p>
      <p>‘The production company have looked into the issue and reported back, Lottie has been informed that her comments were wholly unacceptable and is in no doubt about our view on this.’</p>

      <p>Lottie later defended herself claiming the comments were ‘misinterpreted’ and ‘taken out of context’.</p>
