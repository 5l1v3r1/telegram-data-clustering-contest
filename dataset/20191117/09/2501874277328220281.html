      <p>Meet Frances " Fritz" for short, this adorable 3 month old male cattle dog puppy ( possibly Basenji, Kelpie?) was recently rescued from an over crowded shelter in southern CA.</p>
      <p>Fritz is incredibly smart and sweet with all animals but should be fed separate around other animals! He is a high energy pup that would thrive in a ranch or working type of environment!</p>
      <p>Fritz is going to his foster home today and will be available for adoption soon! <a href="http://www.sparkrescue.org/">www.sparkrescue.org</a></p>
