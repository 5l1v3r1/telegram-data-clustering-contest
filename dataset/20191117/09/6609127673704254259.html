      <p>Ambrose has been without a club since departing Derby County at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> star failed to make an appearance for the Rams' top team after leaving the<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14943/hibernian/"> Hibees</a> to join them.</p>
      <p>Ambrose, 31, has previously admitted he would never rule out a return to Scotland.</p>
      <p>Speaking earlier this month, he said: “I am back in Nigeria now and I am just waiting to see what happens.</p>
      <p>“I am training with my first club, Kaduna, and keeping myself fit. Hopefully in a few weeks I will know about my future.</p>
      <p>“I watch a lot of Scottish football and  keep updated on Celtic and Hibs.</p>
      <p>“I love Scotland and Scottish football, but right now I don’t know what the future holds.”</p>
      <p>Tommy Wright is believed to be keen on adding an experienced centre-back to his ranks while a return to Easter Road would make Ambrose the first signing of the Jack Ross era.</p>
