      <p>Kovac was relieved of his duties following a humiliating 5-1 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt two weeks ago in the Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>Hansi Flick took over on interim basis and led the Bavarians to victories over Olympiakos and Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>"Last Saturday, Uli Hoeness, Hasan Salihamidzic and I publicly announced that Hansi Flick is our head coach 'until further notice'," Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said at the AGM, as per Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"And since we don't want to be asked every Saturday whether Hansi will be our head coach for the next match, I'll tell you, dear members: 'until further notice' means Hansi Flick will bear responsibility in terms of sport at least until Christmas, and potentially beyond.</p>
      <p>"[Flick has an] impressive concept of training and tactics. His handling of the players is very good, and we like his pleasant demeanour. I'm telling you with absolute conviction: We trust Hansi Flick."</p>
