      <h1>Sena workers raise slogans against Fadnavis at Thackeray's memorial event</h1>
      <h2>Following weeks of bitter political drama, the Sena is currently in the process of forming a non-BJP government</h2>

      <p>Former Maharashtra chief minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis </a>was on Sunday subjected to sloganeering by a section of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>workers as he left Shivaji Park in the metropolis after paying tribute to Bal Thackeray on his ninth death anniversary.</p>
      <p>Some Sena workers in close proximity to the former CM's convoy were seen shouting in Marathi Fadnavis' assembly poll campaign slogan: 'I will be back (as CM)' along with the Sena's traditional 'Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj ki jai' war cry.</p>
      <p>Fadnavis and his entourage, which included several senior BJP leaders, moved on without reacting to the jibes.</p>
      <p>There were no <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>leaders, except Uddhav Thackeray's PA Milind Narvekar, when Fadnavis arrived at Shivaji Park to pay tribute to the founder of the Maharashtrian party.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Fadnavis had tweeted a video containing some of the late Sena patriarch's rousing speeches, and had added his voice-over as a tribute.</p>
      <p>The Sena and the BJP contested the October Assembly polls together and won 161 seats between them, before the Uddhav Thackeray-led party's insistence on equal sharing of the chief ministerial tenure led to acrimony and stalemate in government formation.</p>
      <p>Following weeks of bitter political drama, the Sena is currently in the process of forming a non-BJP government with support from Congress and Nationalist Congress Party.</p>
