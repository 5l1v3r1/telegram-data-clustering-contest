      <p>Pasta-lovers, it's time to test your knowledge. Fettuccine and tagliatelle are two forms of long, thick-cut pasta you've probably seen on restaurant menus and eaten plenty of times, but do you know the real difference? If your answer is "no," you're on to something . . . because there's actually no difference at all. As I learned during my trip to <a href="http://www.buitoni.com/">Casa Buitoni</a> in Tuscany (among other things, like <a href="http://www.popsugar.com/food/How-Make-Pasta-From-Scratch-41934724/">how to make pasta from scratch</a>), this popular cut of pasta is named two different things based on region.</p>
      <p>It's called fettuccine in Rome and Southern Italy, and it's referred to as tagliatelle in the Northern regions of Italy. But it's the exact same thing! As a self-proclaimed pasta addict who eats <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Italian-Cooking-Tips-42718058/">Italian food</a> 99 percent of the time, I have to say this information even surprised me. Now I'll never confuse the two on a menu again.</p>
