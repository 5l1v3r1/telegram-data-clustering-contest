      <p>ULAANBAATAR (Mongolia): It rained gold for India at the Asian <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Youth-Boxing">Youth Boxing</a> Championship as all five of the country's women finalists emerged victorious while two men signed off with silver medals here on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Naorem Chanu (51kg), Vinka (64kg) Sanamacha Chanu (75kg), Poonam (54kg) and Sushma (81kg) fetched the yellow metal for the country in a phenomenal sweep.</p>
      <p>Among the men, Selay Soy (49kg) and Ankit Narwal (60kg) settled for the second place after going down in their respective summit clashes.</p>
      <p>India signed off with 12 medals in the event with bronze coming from Arundhati Choudhury (69kg), Komalpreet Kaur (+81kg), Jaismine (57kg), Satender Singh (91kg) and Aman (+91kg).</p>
      <p>Soy began the proceedings for India, going down to Kazakhstan's Bazarbay Ullu Mukhamedsayfi. Narwal was then defeated by Japan's Reito Tsutsume.</p>
      <p>But Poonam defeated China's Weiqi Cai to open India's gold account, to which Sushma added one by going past Kazakhstan's Bakytzhankyzy.</p>
      <p>Naorem Chanu got the better of another Kazakh Anel Barkyah. Vinka outpunched China's Haini Nulataiali, while Sanamachu Chanu, a product of the legendary M C Mary Kom's academy in Manipur, edged past Uzbekistan's Navbakhor Khamidova.</p>
