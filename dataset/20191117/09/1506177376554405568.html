      <p>The President of the Hellenic Republic Prokopios Pavlopoulos called on Turkey to abandon the cruel distortion of history and to respect Greeceâ€™s sovereignty.</p>
      <p>Pavlopoulos made the comments during a ceremony where he was pronounced honorary citizen of Pinios municipality</p>
      <p>The President said Greece is always extending the hand of friendship and of good neighbourly relations to Turkey and its people, as we believe that the past should not divide but unite us in order for the Aegean to be always a sea of peace and of peaceful co-existence.</p>
      <p>However, he underlined that this has as fundamental prerequisite, that Turkey will respect and comply with the international and the European laws in its whole and secondly that it will abandon the history distortion attitude</p>
