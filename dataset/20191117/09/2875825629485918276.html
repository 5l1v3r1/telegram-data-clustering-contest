      <p>Nicole Scherzinger and Thom Evans enjoyed a flirty night out after meeting on Celebrity <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> , in which he is currently starring.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old reality show judge, who split from tennis champ Grigor Dimitrov earlier this year, joined rugby ace Thom, 34, for a secret romantic date this week.</p>
      <p>The pair met up in London with friends and enjoyed dinner and drinks together, a source revealed.</p>
      <p>"Thom is completely Nicole's type. And for his part, Thom was smitten early on — he's always said Nicole is one of the most beautiful women in the world," the insider told the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10361248/nicole-scherzinger-secretly-dating-thom-evans/">Sun</a> .</p>

      <p>"He fancied her long before meeting her on the show. He was initially a bit nervous about starting something up, and ruining his chances on the series, but they had great chemistry from the off.</p>
      <p>"And after weeks of texting, Thom finally plucked up the courage to ask her out, and took her for dinner."</p>
      <p>The mole added: "They met up with friends, all had drinks, and were laughing and joking the whole night. They looked to be having the time of their lives.</p>
      <p>"They both want to focus on the series for now though, and then see what may or may not progress once the show has wrapped. But Nicole deserves to meet someone lovely and everyone is hopeful this will work out."</p>

      <p>Thom is currently on the ITV show with his rugby pals Ben Foden and Levi Davis, who make up the band Try Star.</p>
      <p>And Nicole even told the audience at the show's launch that she'd be up for getting to know them, laughing: "These guys are hot. I'm newly single and ready to mingle."</p>
      <p>However, just two days ago Thom said he was taking a vow of celibacy until The X Factor ends so he can concentrate on winning.</p>
      <p>He bragged that lots of men and women have been sliding into his DMs, but he doesn't want to meet anyone online.</p>

      <p>"I'm single and there are lots of lovely girls on X Factor but I've been focused on the band," he claimed.</p>
      <p>"It's been pretty stressful learning the songs so I've no time to indulge in women.</p>
      <p>"We want to go all the way. It's never been a joke — we all want a record deal. We aren't used to performing so we are learning."</p>
      <p>Nicole was previously in a long-term relationship with F1 champ Lewis Hamilton, while Thom once had a high-profile romance with Kelly Brook, which broke down after she suffered a second miscarriage.</p>
