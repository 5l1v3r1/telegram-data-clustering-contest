        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> have been a cut above the rest of the field this season and it looks as if they are already going to be the team to beat in 2020 after James Allison revealed the team are already working on next season.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> wrapped up his sixth Formula 1 World Championship at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/united-states-grand-prix">US Grand Prix</a>, his fifth with Mercedes and his third in as many years. The only blemish on Hamilton's Mercedes record is the 2016 season which was still won by the Silver Arrow of Nico Rosberg.</p>
      <p>Mercedes have been untouchable in the last six years and you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't expect them to succeed again in 2020. And it looks as if they will be a step ahead of everyone again next year with Allison revealing the team are already working hard next season.</p>

        <i>“It’s not just Ferrari, Red Bull are also looking pretty confident. As the rules are remaining stable, the advantage in Melbourne will be with the team that worked the best in the winter."</i>
