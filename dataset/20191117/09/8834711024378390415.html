      <p>Eastern Cape police have recovered counterfeit goods worth about R7 million at a Port Elizabeth shop.</p>
      <p>The discovery was made earlier this week after a tip-off.</p>
      <p>A multi-disciplinary team swooped on the shop in Port Elizabeth, where authorities discovered various counterfeit products.</p>
      <p>Thousands of bottles of perfume, including brands like Diesel, Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, Polo and Coco Chanel, worth more than R6.95 million was seized.</p>
      <p>Counterfeit clothing worth more than R170,000 – imitating brands like Nike, Adidas, Puma and K-Way – were also confiscated.</p>
      <p>Police say all the seized items were handed over to brand representatives for further investigation.</p>
      <p>The Home Affairs Department has verified both suspects are foreign nationals.</p>
