      <h1>Watch New Sons of Apollo Video for ‘Goodbye Divinity’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T09:12:33+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 09:12</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Kielty</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/sons-of-apollo/">Sons of Apollo</a> have released a new video for their track “Goodbye Divinity,” which appears on their upcoming album <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/sons-of-apollo-mmxx-album/"><i>MMXX</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The band – which features former <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/guns-n-roses/">Guns N’ Roses</a> guitarist Ron “Bumblefoot” Thal, ex-<a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/dream-theater/">Dream Theater</a> members Mike Portnoy and Derek Sherinian, onetime <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/journey/">Journey</a> singer Jeff Scott Soto and <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/mr-big/">Mr. Big</a> bassist Billy Sheehan – launch the follow-up to debut LP <i>Psychotic Symphony</i> on Jan. 17.</p>
      <p>You can watch the “Goodby Divinity” video below:</p>

      <p>“From the minute we finished writing ‘Goodbye Divinity,’ I knew we had our album opener and the first release off the album," drummer Portnoy told <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/sons-of-apollo-release-new-video-for-goodbye-divinity"><i>Prog</i></a>. "I even remember posting on social media how excited I was about the song the day I tracked it!”</p>
      <p>He continued: “The song has an immediacy that grabs you right away: great riffs, flashy playing and hooky vocal melodies. All of the elements that make up the SOA sound. The video was directed by Vicente Cordero who I have now done over 20 music videos with … its look helps catapult the band from the Greek mythological past of the last album into the 21st century with this new album."</p>
      <p>When <i>MMXX</i> was announced, Portnoy reported: “<i>Psychotic Symphony</i> was the first time the five of us had worked together, so there was bound to be an air of experimentation happening. Now we can draw on having the experience not only of recording that album but also of touring together a lot. And now there is clearly a lot more obvious chemistry going on. ... The last time, it certainly must have felt a little weird for Bumblefoot to be writing with Derek and me, because we were strangers to him. Now we know one another better, and that helped things push along.”</p>

      <h4>The Gak</h4>
      <p>Sebastian Bach participated in a one-off supergroup called the Gak with three members of Guns N' Roses -- Axl Rose, Slash and Duff McKagan -- and three members of Metallica: James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett and Lars Ulrich. The occasion was a party thrown by 'RIP' magazine in Los Angeles. They took their name from a slang term for cocaine.</p>

      <h4>Big Dirty Band</h4>
      <p>When the Canadian TV show 'Trailer Park Boys,' was set to make a movie, Rush's Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson led an all-Canadian supergroup comprised of members of Big Wreck, Three Days Grace, Die Mannequin and the Tea Party. They recorded a cover of Bobby Fuller Four's "I Fought the Law."</p>

      <h4>Lord Sutch and Heavy Friends</h4>
      <p>Screaming Lord Sutch was an eccentric British horror rocker who gained a cult following in the '60s. For his 1970 debut, he got contributions from stars Jimmy Page (who co-produced), John Bonham, Jeff Beck, Nicky Hopkins and Noel Redding. Despite the musical firepower of the guests, it received savage reviews and reached only No. 84 in the 'Billboard' album chart.</p>

      <h4>Steampacket</h4>
      <p>Steampacket (or Steam Packet) could be called a reverse supergroup, in that everyone in it went to greater fame. In the summer of 1965, Long John Baldry, a mainstay of the British blues scene, formed the group with singers Rod Stewart and Julie Driscoll, keyboardist Brian Auger and guitarist Vic Briggs. They gigged around the U.K. for a little more than a year, with Stewart leaving in March 1966 and Baldry quitting that August.</p>

      <h4>Shadow King</h4>
      <p>After a pair of solo albums following his departure from Foreigner, Lou Gramm got together with guitarist Vivian Campbell, who had established quite a reputation by this point with Dio and Whitesnake, and Donnie Iris and the Cruisers drummer Kevin Valentine to form Shadow King. Their only album, a self-titled release from 1991, was produced by Keith Olsen, with whom Gramm had worked on Foreigner's 'Double Vision.' Another song they recorded, "One Dream," appeared on the soundtrack to 'Highlander II: The Quickening,' although it was credited to the Lou Gramm Band.</p>

      <h4>SuperHeavy</h4>
      <p>During a break from the Rolling Stones, Mick Jagger created SuperHeavy with Dave Stewart (Eurythmics), singer Joss Stone, reggae star Damian Marley and Bollywood composer A.R. Rahman. They reportedly cut 29 songs in only 10 days, and 12 were released on a self-titled album in 2011.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>The Law</h4>
      <p>Singer Paul Rodgers teamed up with drummer Kenney Jones and created the Law. Their 12-song self-titled album came in 1991. Despite featuring songs written by Phil Collen, Bryan Adams and Chris Rea, and guitar work from Dave Gilmour on one track, the record peaked at only No. 126, although "Laying Down the Law" was a big hit at album-rock radio.</p>

      <h4>The Dirty Mac</h4>
      <p>The Dirty Mac was a one-off supergroup put together in 1968 for the Rolling Stones 'Rock and Roll Circus' television show, but it can't get much more super than its lineup: John Lennon, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and Mitch Mitchell. They performed the Beatles' "Yer Blues" and backed Yoko Ono on a free-form piece called "Whole Lotta Yoko."</p>

      <h4>Bruce-Baker-Moore</h4>
      <p>Despite decades of well-known animosity between them, former Cream bandmates Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker looked to recreate their magic in 1993 with a new power trio. They brought in Irish guitar legend Gary Moore, who was also the principal songwriter, and put out 'Around the Next Dream' a year later. They broke up following a handful of concerts in the U.K. and Europe.</p>

      <h4>Eric Clapton’s Powerhouse</h4>
      <p>Looking to fill out a few tracks for a 1966 blues compilation called 'What's Shakin',' producer Joe Boyd, on the suggestion of Manfred Mann's Paul Jones, looked to use some of the stars of London's blues scene. Eric Clapton, fresh off his time with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, was the guitarist, and Steve Winwood, who was starting to make his name with the Spencer Davis Group, was recruited to sing. The rest of the group was comprised of three members of Manfred Mann -- Jones (harmonica), Jack Bruce (bass) and Pete York (drums) -- and pianist Ben Palmer. They recorded four songs, three of which made the record, and Clapton and Bruce formed Cream soon after.</p>

      <h4>Damnocracy</h4>
      <p>Damnocracy was created in 2006 for the purposes of a VH1 reality program called 'Supergroup,' in which a bunch of rockers had to live together and collaborate on putting on a show. The group consisted of former Skid Row singer Sebastian Bach, Ted Nugent, Jason Bonham, Scott Ian (from Anthrax) and Evan Seinfeld (Biohazard). After the show, which includes highlights from their respective catalogs, some Led Zeppelin and AC/DC covers and a new song called "Take It Back," the members returned to their day jobs.</p>

      <h4>Captain Beyond</h4>
      <p>One of the longest serving supergroups, Captain Beyond formed in 1971 and, despite a handful of periodic breakups in between, toured as recently as 2015. Blending prog-rock intricacy with blues-based psychedelia, the band featured original Deep Purple singer Rod Evans (who fronted the band during their more prog-focused incarnation), guitarist Larry "Rhino" Reinhardt and bassist Lee Dorman, both of Iron Butterfly, and Johnny Winter drummer Bobby Caldwell. The band released three records including a live album during their initial run from 1971-73, and the current touring lineup includes Caldwell as the only original member; Reinhardt and Dorman both died in 2012.</p>

      <h4>Rock Star Supernova</h4>
      <p>After INXS found a new lead singer on the reality TV show 'Rock Star,' the second season featured a supergroup consisting of Tommy Lee, Jason Newsted and Gilby Clarke holding a competition to find a new singer. After 15 episodes, Lukas Rossi was crowned the winner. An album was released in late 2006, and they went on tour to promote it.</p>

      <h4>HSAS</h4>
      <p>In 1983, Sammy Hagar got together with Neal Schon of Journey, and recruited bassist Kenny Aaronson (Billy Squier, Foghat) and drummer Michael Shrieve (Santana) to form HSAS. They recorded their album, 1984's 'Through the Fire,' live in concert at the Warfield Theater in San Francisco, with minimal overdubs added. Their lone single was a cover of Procol Harum's "A Whiter Shade of Pale."</p>

      <h4>Planet Us</h4>
      <p>Sammy Hagar, Neal Schon, Michael Anthony and Deen Castronovo formed Planet Us in 2002. They tried to snag Slash too, but he turned them down, so the guitarist gig went to Joe Satriani instead. They didn't last long, but the seeds were planted for another supergroup - Chickenfoot.</p>

      <h4>WhoCares</h4>
      <p>In 2011, Ian Gillan of Deep Purple and Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath got together to raise funds to help rebuild a music school in Gyumri, Armenia, that had been destroyed by an earthquake. Along with friends Jon Lord, Jason Newsted, Nicko McBrain (from Iron Maiden) and Mikko Lindstrom (HIM), they recorded two songs as WhoCares, "Out of My Mind" and "Holy Water." That was followed a year later by a two-CD set that packaged those tracks with rarities from throughout Iommi's and Gillan's careers.</p>

      <h4>GTR</h4>
      <p>In 1985, prog-rock guitar heroes Steve Howe (Yes, Asia) and Steve Hackett (Genesis) formed GTR with singer Max Bacon. Their lone album reached No. 11 on the 'Billboard' album chart and they had a Top 20 hit in "When the Heart Rules the Mind." But perhaps it's best remembered for the review it received from J.D. Considine in 'Musician' magazine: "SHT."</p>

      <h4>Hardline</h4>
      <p>Formed in 1991 by brothers Johnny and Joey Gioeli, glam-metal supergroup Hardline included Todd Jensen (Sequel, Harlow), Neal Schon (Journey, Bad English) and Deen Castronovo (Bad English, Tony MacAlpine). The band released one self-titled album in 1992 before disbanding. They re-emerged in 2002 with an altered lineup, and have continued to record and perform.</p>

      <h4>The Storm</h4>
      <p>Exiled from Journey in 1985, the rhythm section of Ross Valory (bass) and Steve Smith (drums) picked up founding Journey keyboardist Gregg Rolie and 707 vocalist Kevin Chalfant and created the Storm. A one-hit-wonder, the Storm earned a Top 40 hit with their eponymous debut album's power ballad "I've Got a Lot to Learn About Love" in 1991 before dissolving two years later.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Blizzard of Ozz</h4>
      <p>A bit of explanation is in order: Ozzy Osbourne's first project after leaving Black Sabbath was originally intended as a supergroup. In 1980. he enlisted Randy Rhoads (Quiet Riot), Lee Kerslake (Uriah Heep), Bob Daisley (Rainbow) and Don Airey (Rainbow), and christened it Blizzard of Ozz. But even though early press photos confirmed it as a group, Jet Records instead credited the album to Osbourne and used the band name for the album's title. Daisley has since argued that he co-founded the band; Osbourne and Rhodes are generally recognized as the principal songwriting engine.</p>

      <h4>Squackett</h4>
      <p>More than two decades after GTR, former Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett got together with another Yes legend, bassist Chris Squire, and formed Squackett. It came about when Squire was looking for a guitarist for a solo project and was put in contact with Hackett. Their one album, 'A Life Within a Day,' came out in 2012.</p>

      <h4>B.L.T.</h4>
      <p>The talents of former Cream bassist Jack Bruce and ex-Procol Harum guitarist Robin Trower were always best-suited for a power trio, so it made sense that the two virtuosos would eventually work together. In 1981, they enlisted drummer Bill Lordan (from Sly &amp; the Family Stone) and released 'B.L.T.' Although Lordan didn't last beyond that album, Trower and Bruce recorded 1982's 'Truce,' and returned for 2008's 'Seven Moons.'</p>

      <h4>Union</h4>
      <p>After his time with Motley Crue came to a halt, singer John Corabi formed Union in 1997 with late-era Kiss guitarist Bruce Kulick, David Lee Roth bassist James Hunting and touring drummer Brent Fitz. They lasted for three studio albums, 'Union' (1998), 'Live in the Galaxy' (1999) and 'The Blue Room' (2000), before calling it quits in 2002.</p>

      <h4>Brides of Destruction</h4>
      <p>Initially called Cockstar, Nikki Sixx and L.A. Guns guitarist Tracii Guns formed Brides of Destruction in 2002 following Mötley Crüe's 2001 hiatus. After briefly flirting with the moniker Motordog and testing differing lineup configurations, the group released its 2004 debut 'Here Come the Brides' with singer London LeGrand, drummer Scot Coogan and guitarist John Corabi. After further lineup shakeups, the band released its second and final album, 'Runaway Brides,' in 2005.</p>

      <h4>58</h4>
      <p>During Motley Crue's turn-of-the-century hiatus, Nikki Sixx got together with Boxing Gandhis guitarist Dave Darling, Steve Gibb (son of Bee Gee Barry) and drummer Bucket Baker. Taking their name from the year in which Sixx and Darling were born, 58's lone album, 'Diet for a New America,' featured a mash-up of genres, including a cover of Gilbert O'Sullivan's soft-rock 1972 hit, "Alone Again (Naturally)."</p>

      <h4>Paice Ashton Lord</h4>
      <p>After the breakup of Deep Purple's Mk. IV, founding members Ian Paice and Jon Lord picked up veteran singer Tony Ashton, who had worked with Lord in the past. Released in 1977, their only album, 'Malice in Wonderland,' veered away from the progressive hard rock of Deep Purple into R&amp;B and funk territory. They broke up a year later.</p>

      <h4>Badlands</h4>
      <p>After being fired from Ozzy Osbourne's band, guitarist Jake E. Lee formed Badlands with two former members of Black Sabbath, singer Ray Gillen and drummer Eric Singer, and bassist Greg Chaisson. After their 1989 self-titled debut, Singer left to join Kiss, and was replaced by Jeff Martin of Racer X. Internal squabbling led to Gillen being fired around the time of 1991's 'Voodoo Highway,' although he was brought back to tour behind it. The band broke up in 1993.</p>

      <p>Assembling a backing band to tour in support of his 1999 solo album 'Beautiful Disease,' Duff McKagan's Loaded became a full-time operation when the album was shelved. McKagan's Loaded released their debut, 'Dark Days,' in 2001 with Martin Feveyear, Dave Dederer (from the Presidents of the United States of America) and Geoff Reading (New American Shame). The group disbanded in 2002, but returned with 'Sick' in 2009 and 'The Taking' in 2011.</p>

      <h4>Neurotic Outsiders</h4>
      <p>By the mid-'90s, punk rock was enjoying its third wave. And one of its premier architects, Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones, assembled a cast of like-minded industry luminaries to establish Neurotic Outsiders. Joined by Duran Duran's John Taylor, Guns N' Roses's Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum, the decorated quartet released their only album, 'Angelina,' in 1997.</p>

      <h4>Living Loud</h4>
      <p>After Ozzy Osbourne had reissued his first two solo albums with a different rhythm section, the men who played the original parts, bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake, got together with the albums' original keyboardist, Don Airey, Deep Purple's Steve Morse and singer Jimmy Barnes to form Living Loud. For their self-titled 2004 record, they cut new versions of six Osbourne songs that Daisley wrote and five originals.</p>

      <h4>Saints of the Underground</h4>
      <p>Comprised of well-established glam-metal veterans, Saints of the Underground formed the way most first-time acts do: by light-heartedly jamming cover songs with peers. Featuring Jani Lane (Warrant), Bobby Blotzer (Ratt), Keri Kelly (Alice Cooper) and Chuck Wright (Quiet Riot), Saints of the Underground released their sole album 'Love the Sin, Hate the Sinner' in 2008.</p>

      <p>In 1990, L.A. Guns manager Allen Kovac set out to construct a band consisting of glam-metal scene VIPs. Recruiting the likes of Michael Schenker (Michael Schenker Group), Richard Black (Shark Island), Tracii Guns (L.A. Guns), Share Pedersen (Vixen) and Bobby Blotzer (Ratt), the group released a self-titled album in 1991. The band was short-lived, however, dissolving two years later.</p>

      <h4>New Race</h4>
      <p>In 1981, a pair of Detroit proto-punks, Ron Asheton of the Stooges and Dennis "Machine Gun" Thompson of MC5, joined up with three members of Australia's Radio Birdman -- Deniz Tek, Rob Younger and Warwick Gilbert -- to create New Race for an Australian tour. 'The First and Last' was a live album compiled from those dates, although Younger re-recorded his vocals in the studio.</p>

      <h4>Blue Murder</h4>
      <p>In 1987, John Sykes picked up a record deal after getting fired from Whitesnake on the eve of the band's breakthrough. But rather than go solo, he hooked up with Firm bassist Tony Franklin and veteran drummer Carmen Appice and launched Blue Murder. But after their 1989 self-titled debut, he replaced them with Marco Mendoza and Tommy O'Steen for 1993's 'Nothin' but Trouble.' A live album released only in Japan followed the next year, and Sykes then opted to go solo.</p>

      <p>Birthed by Tim Bogart and Carmine Appice, the former Vanilla Fudge members enlisted the talents of Jim McCarty (Mitch Ryder's Detroit Wheels) and Rusty Day (the Amboy Dukes) to form Cactus in 1969. The band managed four albums before dissolving in 1975. They resurfaced for 'Cactus V' in 2006.</p>

      <p>When the Electric Flag dissolved for the second time in 1974, blues-rock guitar legend Mike Bloomfield and Electric Flag co-founder, keyboardist Barry Goldberg, enlisted songwriter Raymond Kennedy. The trio used the first letter of their last names for their project, and they released 'KGB' in early 1976. The rhythm section was comprised of two men who had histories with supergroups: bassist Ric Grech (Blind Faith) and Carmine Appice (Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice).</p>

      <h4>The Greedies</h4>
      <p>During some time away from Thin Lizzy in 1978, Phil Lynott formed a loose supergroup with Steve Jones and Paul Cook, who were without a band following the breakup of the Sex Pistols. Called the Greedies (short for "Greedy Bastards"), they played a handful of gigs, and sometimes Lynott's bandmates Gary Moore and Scott Gorham joined them. Their lone release was a 1979 Christmas single, "A Merry Jingle," a medley of "We Wish You a Merry Christmas" and "Jingle Bells."</p>

      <p>After leaving the folk-inspired progressive group Renaissance in 1970, former Yardbirds singer Keith Relf then took to producing other artists, including Steamhammer. It was out of this venture that came his next musical project. Recruiting Steamhammer's Martin Pugh and Louis Cennamo on guitar and bass, respectively, the newly formed Armageddon would additionally include Bobby Caldwell, a drummer from Johnny Winter's backing band. Aided by Cennamo's friend Peter Frampton, the group struck a recording and management contract, releasing their only album, the eponymous 'Armageddon,' in 1975.</p>

      <p>As a result of internal band disputes, guitarist Barry Goudreau left Boston in 1981. In establishing Orion the Hunter, Goudreau sought the assistance of former Heart drummer Michael DeRosier and Fran Cosmo, who had performed on Goudreau's 1980 solo album. They released their sole self-titled studio album, which featured backing vocals by Boston's Brad Delp, in 1984.</p>

      <p>Every aspiring guitar hero has to start somewhere. But Joe Bonamassa outdid most when he, while still in his preteen years, had refined his blues licks to the point where he was opening for B.B. King at the age of 12. Before Bonamassa was legal, he formed Bloodline, featuring musicians associated with Miles Davis, Robby Krieger and Berry Oakley. The group scored a minor hit with "Stone Cold Hearted" in 1994.</p>

Malmsteen left for a solo career a year later and was replaced by another up-and-coming guitarist, Steve Vai. The group disbanded , but were revived from 2006-14.</p>

They brought in guitarist Allan Holdsworth (Soft Machine, Gong) and keyboardist/violinist Eddie Jobson (Roxy Music) for U.K. An album followed in 1978, but Bruford and Holdsworth left after their tour. Deciding to go without a guitarist, they brought in drummer Terry Bozzio for 1979's 'Danger Money' and a live album, 'Night After Night.' Wetton formed Asia shortly afterward, but the trio reunited in 2012.</p>

Their 1990 album resulted in two major hits, "More Than Words Can Say" and "Waiting for Love," and a minor one in "Haunted Heart." However, the Heart contingency soon left, and the two Sheriffs re-formed the group in 2009 with other members.</p>

Power Station, John and Andy Taylor’s team-up with singer Robert Palmer, grabbed the majority of the headlines. Meanwhile, Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes and Roger Taylor formed Arcadia, a synth-pop outfit that achieved a Top 10 hit on both sides of the Atlantic with “Election Day" before dissolving the following year.</p>

To underscore their lack of polish in 1960, Softley recruited a sextet of alternative rockers -- Greg Dulli (Afghan Whigs), Dave Pirner (Soul Asylum), Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth), Don Fleming (Gumball), Mike Mills (R.E.M.) and Dave Grohl (Nirvana) to play revved-up versions of covers that were part of the Beatles' set lists in those days.</p>

Navarro, with drummer Michael Murphy and Jane's Addiction bassist Eric Avery, used Deconstruction as vehicle for more sensitive and experimental material. The trio released a self-titled album in 1994, but while the commercial impact of the record was nil, 'Deconstruction' has regained a modest cult following.</p>
