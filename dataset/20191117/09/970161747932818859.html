        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/billy-mayhew/">Billy Mayhew</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/daniel-brocklebank/">Daniel Brocklebank</a>) and Paul Foreman (Peter Ash) have quite the history in Coronation Street, and it appears as if that spark between them is still very much there, as in the coming episodes, the pair rekindle their romance — just prior to Bernie and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/gemma-winter/">Gemma Winter</a> (Jane Hazelgrove and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dolly-rose-campbell/">Dolly-Rose Campbell</a>) learning the truth about sex abuser Kel (Joe Alessi) is revealed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bernie (Jane Hazelgrove) prepares for her first day on the job as cleaner at the church hall, and she informs to Paul that Billy is the one who gave her a job — and Paul’s left confused as a result.</p>
      <p>With this playing over in his mind, Paul later quizzes the vicar about why he helped his mum out, and Billy reveals that he just wanted to help because he loves him.</p>
      <p>Paul’s taken aback by what Billy’s said. However, he later takes it upon himself to whip up a romantic meal for both him and Billy, and — when Billy returns home — Paul informs him he very much wants him in his life.</p>

      <p>However, in spite of their happiness, the second half of the week proves difficult for Paul as the truth about what Kel did to him comes to light in shocking fashion, as Bernie and Gemma (Dolly-Rose Campbell) realise that Kel was responsible for a string of burglaries which have taken place on the cobbles.</p>
      <p>After breaking into his place, they discovery old pictures of Kel with Paul — as well as with other children. Afterwards, they bring the photos back home, and Paul’s devastated. He proceeds to open up about the fact that Kel sexually abused him — leaving both Bernie and Gemma shocked.</p>
