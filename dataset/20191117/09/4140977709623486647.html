          <p>During the eighth match of the ongoing second season of the Mzansi Super League between Jozi Stars and Nelson Mandela Bay Giants in Johannesburg, Nelson Mandela Bay Giants pacer Junior Dala bowled an inch-perfect yorker to dismiss Jozi Stars opening batsman Chris Gayle.</p>
          <p>It all happened on the penultimate delivery of the fourth over when Gayle had no answer to an unplayable delivery from 29-year old Dala. The stumps flying in the air was icing on the cake for the Giants’ fast bowler.</p>

                <p>Having opened the batting with Reeza Hendricks (6), Gayle ended up scoring 6 (11) with the help of one four. After Stars captain Temba Bavuma won the toss and chose to bat, the hosts’ batsmen didn’t justify his decision as they were bundled out for 108 in 18.5 overs.</p>
                <p>Bavuma, who came in to bat at No. 3 in the third over, top-scored for his team with 27 (31) with the help of two fours. With bowling figures of 4-0-19-3, Dala was the pick of the bowlers for the visitors.</p>

                      <p>A brisk 52-run opening stand between Jason Roy (31) and Ben Dunk (50*) powered Nelson Mandela Bay Giants to an impressive start. Having scored his 13th T20 half-century off 30 balls and inclusive of four fours and four sixes, Dunk led his team to victory in the 10th over.</p>
                      <p>With two wins in three matches, Bay Giants are currently at the top of the points table in the tournament. On the other hand, Jozi Stars have lost all their four matches and are reeling at the bottom.</p>
