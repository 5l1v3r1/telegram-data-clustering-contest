      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T09:46:27+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 09:46</time> by <a rel="author">Will Stewart, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-stewart/</a></address>
      <p>The world’s only brown <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/bears">bear</a> serving a prison sentence in a human jail has been 'released' after 15 years.</p>
      <p>Katya was locked up alongside murderers and other criminals when she was sent to a Kazakhstan prison in 2004.</p>
      <p>The grizzly was found guilty of maiming two people at a camp site in two separate incidents, leading to her bizarre sentence.</p>
      <p>But after a decade and a half, she will now be moved to a mini-zoo at a recreation centre where she is promised more freedom.</p>
      <p>The large beast - full name Ekaterina - had been the Kazakhstan jail’s most famous and unusual inmate before her relase.</p>
      <p>A gold-coloured statue was even built in her honour at the prison which holds 730 dangerous criminals.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>She had a two-cage ‘cell’ and her own swimming pool at Kostanay ‘strict regime’ penal colony number 16/2 , and she was cared for by inmates.</p>
      <p>Now the bear will undergo ‘rehabilitation’ in a cage after her incarceration that meant she was not exposed to other animals.</p>
      <p>“She faces a medical examination and a long adaptation period,” said a jail spokesman.</p>
      <p>”The bear will be taught to live in the conditions that are almost natural.”</p>

      <p>For now, pictures show the new cage looking grim - as if the bear has switched one jail cell for another.</p>
      <p>At the bleak penal colony, inmates are reportedly missing the bear.</p>
      <p>Yerlan Zhutaev, spokesperson of the penal colony, said: "There was a pool where she could play, swim, and sleep nearby.</p>
      <p>“All this time she was with us prisoners looked after her.”</p>
      <p>But Valentina Dmitrienko, head of Abkshino recreation centre, said in her new home she is mixing with other bears.</p>
      <p>“Our male bear Yashka was very happy to see her,” she said.</p>

      <p>“He put his paw right through this cage, hugged her, and kissed like a human.</p>
      <p>“We were all happy for such a warm welcome and everyone was touched by such a meeting."</p>
      <p>The mini-zoo now has three bears, along with wolves, a camel, a pony, a donkey, and a yak.</p>
      <p>Locals pay 200 tenge or 40 pence to enter.</p>
      <p>The bear was jailed after two separate attacks on people causing actual bodily harm at a camp site where she was previously caged.</p>
      <p>She was the only female in a male penal colony for inmates serving less than 25 years.</p>

      <p>Officials could find nowhere else to keep her at the time.</p>
      <p>Unlike other prisoners, Katya was not allowed conjugal visits.</p>
      <p>The jail’s deputy head of educational work Azamat Gapbasov said earlier this year before her release: “Sadly we cannot take a male bear to her.</p>
      <p>“If only we could make artificial insemination….”</p>
      <p>Bleak Kostanay penal outpost is 435 miles north west of Kazakhstan’s capital Nur-sultan.</p>
      <p>Her now home is 235 miles away in Petropavlovsk.</p>
