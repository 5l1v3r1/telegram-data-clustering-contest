      <p>Here are the key talking points from Wales' 2-0 win over Azerbaijan in Baku.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The perfect night</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you'd have offered a copy of the script as it actually panned out before the two Group E fixtures got underway, hands would have been bitten off all over the shop.</p>
      <p>Wales were two goals to the good after 34 minutes and were rarely troubled by Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>They were able to withdraw Gareth Bale on the hour mark, giving Aaron Ramsey the chance to feature for his country for the first time in a year in the process.</p>
      <p>Daniel James and Bale - who both went into the match a booking away from being given a one-game ban - managed to avoid any kind of punishment from German referee Deniz Aytekin.</p>

      <p>And it also appears that those who took to the field in Baku emerged unscathed, which will be music to the ears of Ryan Giggs.</p>
      <p>Even after their routine win, things got better for the Red Dragons as Croatia came from behind to beat Slovakia 3-1, a result that means Wales' fate is now firmly in their own hands.</p>
      <p>As evenings go, they don't get any more perfect. Although that could change again on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Moore, Moore, Moore</b>
      </p>
      <p>Giggs' men are now unbeaten in their last five matches, winning twice against Azerbaijan as well as claiming draws with Slovakia and Croatia to add to a friendly triumph against Belarus.</p>
      <p>And it's no coincidence that Kieffer Moore has played in the last four of those outings.</p>
      <p>The forward impressed on his debut against Belarus and netted his first international goal on his first competitive start for Wales in the 1-1 draw with Slovakia.</p>
      <p>Not only has been more than willing to put his body on the line, but it's Moore's hold up play and aerial ability that have really helped to bring the best out of those behind him.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>Gareth Bale and Daniel James have been hugely influential in the wide positions while Jonny Williams, Aaron Ramsey and Harry Wilson are also among those to benefit from the towering forward's selfless work.</p>
      <p>He got the ball rolling at the Bakcell Arena with a close range header in the 10th minute, and it means Moore now boasts a record of scoring two goals in his four caps for his country.</p>
      <p>Hal Robson-Kanu and Sam Vokes performed a similar role under Chris Coleman, and Giggs is certainly reaping the rewards of a tactic that previously played such a huge part in Wales' dream run to the semi-finals of Euro 2016.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The two changes most likely to be made</b>
      </p>
      <p>Joe Allen missed the clash with Azerbaijan due to suspension, although he is available to feature against Hungary on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>And it's almost certain that Ramsey will play some part having had a 30-minute run out in Baku.</p>
      <p>Whether he's deemed fit enough to play the full 90 minutes, or even to start, remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>However, the composure and nous the Juventus star demonstrated on his return to the international fold will no doubt have whetted the appetites of the Red Wall ahead of Tuesday's mouth-watering fixture at Cardiff City Stadium.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Wales' Aaron Ramsey<cite>(Image: PA)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Giggs is likely to stick with goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey and the back four of Connor Roberts, Chris Mepham, Tom Lockyer and Ben Davies for the game against Hungary, although there's every chance Ashley Williams could get the nod.</p>
      <p>The attacking trio of Bale, James and Moore should also play from the outset. But should - as hoped - Allen and Ramsey return, two men must miss out.</p>
      <p>The most likely candidates to drop out at present are goalscorer Harry Wilson and central midfielder Joe Morrell.</p>
      <p>Both impressed in Azerbaijan and could have every right to feel aggrieved if they're listed among the substitutes on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>But the pair have plenty to offer if coming off the bench, particularly Morrell as Ethan Ampadu is unlikely to play the full 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>It's a headache Giggs has so desperately craved, and one that means Wales will be as close to full strength as they have been for some time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The raucous atmosphere</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hungary go into Tuesday's game knowing that they will qualify for Euro 2020 with a win against Giggs' side, while they could even progress with a draw, depending on Slovakia's result with Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>Their allocation of tickets for the game in the Welsh capital were snapped up in no time at all.</p>
      <p>Wales were greeted with a hostile atmosphere in the reverse fixture at Budapest's Groupama Arena back in June.</p>

        <figcaption>The Red Wall captured Europe's imagination during Euro 2016.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>But the Hungarians can expect a dose of their own medicine this week, with the game set to be a sell out as the Red Wall bid to roar on their side to next year's tournament.</p>
      <p>Fans will remember the heartbreaks of losing to Republic of Ireland in 2017, to Russia in 2003 and Romania in 1993 only too well.</p>
      <p>But after such gut-wrenching near misses in the past, the time is right for Wales to banish those demons and do the business in front of what will be a bouncing Cardiff City Stadium.</p>
