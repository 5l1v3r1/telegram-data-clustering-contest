      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T09:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Hamilton Advertiser, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/hamilton-advertiser/</a></address>
      <p>A Bellshill motorist has been jailed for a year after driving his car deliberately at two men following a Facebook row.</p>
      <p>Arran Kyle had been accused of nearly knocking down a woman and a child at traffic lights in Bellshill.</p>
      <p>After an online slanging match with the woman and her partner – William Cook – Kyle went to Mr Cook’s workplace armed with knives.</p>
      <p>Hamilton Sheriff Court heard that a fight started before Kyle broke free, went back to his vehicle and drove at Mr Cook, trying unsuccessfully to strike him.</p>
      <p>He then drove repeatedly at Graham Simpson, who had been filming the incident, and the car struck him on the body.</p>
      <p>Vish Kathuria, prosecuting, said Mr Simpson was not injured, but Mr Cook suffered a dislocated shoulder when he fell during the struggle.</p>
      <p>The car was driven at him “at speed” and he had to jump out of the way to avoid being hit.</p>
      <p>Footage of the incident was shown in court.</p>
      <p>Kyle, 24, of Turquoise Terrace, Bellshill, admitted assaulting the men at M&amp;J Auto Salvage in Aitkenhead Road, Uddingston, on November 27 last year.</p>
      <p>He had earlier been involved in an altercation with Mr Cook’s partner who accused him of driving too fast in Bellshill town centre.</p>
      <p>She took a photo of his car and posted it on Facebook.</p>
      <p>An online argument followed, with Kyle insisting he had been driving responsibly and she should not have been crossing the road when the traffic lights were at green.</p>
      <p>Mr Cook posted that he would “love to meet this so-called hard man in person”.</p>
      <p>Kyle then turned up at Mr Cook’s workplace, brandishing knives. Film footage appeared to show him trying to strike Mr Cook with a blade at one point during their struggle.</p>
      <p>Defence agent Tracy Paterson described her client as “a genuine first offender”.</p>
      <p>She told the court: “This started as something relatively minor that spiralled out of control. It appears to be very much a one-off incident.</p>
      <p>“There were elements that could be seen as provocation, but he should not have acted in this way.</p>
      <p>“He is remorseful for getting involved in this situation and since then he has not really engaged in social media.</p>
      <p>“He has decided it is better for his own sake to stay off it.”</p>
      <p>Ms Paterson said Kyle, a full-time student, has been undergoing counselling for depression.</p>
      <p>She added: “This incident has caused considerable stress for him and his family.</p>
      <p>“His partner is in court to support him and I would submit he is suitable for a community-based sentence.”</p>
      <p>However, Sheriff David Bicket told Kyle: “Having watched the footage of this, and despite you being a first offender, I consider these charges to be so serious that they can be dealt with only by custody.”</p>
      <p>The sheriff said he would have imposed an 18-month stretch but reduced it to 12 months because of the guilty pleas.</p>
