      <p>Just a week after being sentenced to four years in prison, rapper <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/kodak-black">Kodak Black</a> has now been hit with additional weapons charges in Florida. According to reports, the musician has been charged by state prosecutors with two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, with each charge carrying a maximum prison sentence of 30 years.</p>
      <p>The latest charges come immediately after Kodak Black was sentenced to 46 months in prison for lying about his criminal history whilst purchasing firearms. In particular, he hid the fact that we was out on bond at the time for sexual assault charges in California when buying the weapons. He was arrested on his way to Rolling Loud in May and pleaded guilty in August.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned as the story develops.</p>
