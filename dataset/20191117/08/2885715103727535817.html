      <h1>Pune: On Express trains, evening tea for Rs 140, lunch and dinner for Rs 245</h1>
      <h2>Railways hikes food charges on Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto Express</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:04:58+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>Passengers travelling in the Pune-Secunderabad Shatabdi Express, the Pune-Howrah Duronto Express and Pune-Ahmedabad Duronto Express will now have to shell out more to buy tea, breakfast as well as meals during their journey, as the Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (<a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/irctc/">IRCTC</a>) has revised its food rates. The higher charges are applicable for meals on Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto Express, as well as for food items sold by IRCTC on other Express trains.</p>
      <p>There’s only one Shatabdi Train that is run by the Pune Division — the Pune-Secunderabad Shatabdi Express which plies six days a week. There are three Duronto trains, Pune-Howrah (twice a week), Pune-Nizamuddin (twice a week), and Pune- Ahmedabad (thrice a week). Another Duronto train, Mumbai-Secunderabad, passes via Pune.</p>
      <p>As per the new menu, the morning tea on these trains will cost Rs 35 (the earlier price was Rs 15) in the first AC and executive chair car coaches, and Rs 20 (earlier price Rs 10) in the 2nd AC, 3rd AC and chair car coaches. The rate for morning tea will be Rs 15 in the sleeper class of Duronto trains.</p>
      <p>The price of evening tea, which includes snacks, cookies and a pot of tea, has also been revised to Rs 140 from the current rate of Rs 75 for first class and executive cars.</p>
      <p>An IRCTC official said the revised rates will come into effect from November 18.</p>
      <p>This is the first time the IRCTC has revised food charges for Express trains since 2012 and for Rajdhani/Shatabdi/Duronto trains since 2013. The new meal charges are not applicable for Gatimaan Express, Tejas Express and Vande Bharat Express.</p>
      <p>Harsha Shah of the Railway Pravasi Group said passengers may not mind the increased cost of food and beverages if the food quality shows a marked improvement.</p>
      <p>“The quality should improve with the increase in prices… The rates have remained unchanged since 2013. Now that the IRCTC has increased the price, the quality of food must improve. Passengers expect to be served freshly-prepared, hygienic and good-quality food,” said Shah.</p>
