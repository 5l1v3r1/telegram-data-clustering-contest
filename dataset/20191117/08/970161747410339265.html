      <p>Mateo Kovacic says he is trying to adjust his mentality to score more goals after being challenged by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> manager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/frank-lampard/">Frank Lampard</a> to finally open his account for the side.</p>
      <p>Despite making 69 appearances for Chelsea in all competitions – first on loan from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/real-madrid/">Real Madrid</a> last season, and now as a permanent fixture in the side – the Croatian is still waiting to score his first goal for the west London club.</p>
      <p>Kovacic had a decent record in Italy, scoring eight times in his final season at Inter – including a European hat-trick – before moving to Real, but he has not scored for club or country since January 2017.</p>

      <p>Kovacic has been roundly praised for his performances this season but Lampard feels <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/frank-lampard-urges-mateo-kovacic-score-goals-chelsea-11069716/">the one thing he is lacking is goals</a>, and the 25-year-old is eager to try and rectify the issue.</p>

      <p>‘The most important is the first one. One year at Inter I scored a lot of goals because I started the season scoring a lot of goals. Then you continue and it goes along,’ Kovacic told Chelsea’s website.</p>
      <p>‘I never had the pressure to score goals, I was never obsessed because my game is not about goals, but obviously if I want to go to the next step I need to improve it.</p>
      <p>‘The coach was the greatest goalscoring midfielder that ever played. There were many, but he really scored a lot of goals. He tells me always that I need to shoot. Now I am trying more!</p>
      <p>‘It’s just a thing of mentality, to try to score, to be aggressive and to have the hunger to score goals. I want to improve that, I’m trying to improve that and I am sure I will get there.’</p>

      <p>Asked if he wants Kovacic to score more, Lampard said earlier this month: ‘Yes. I do and he does. The quality he has shown in big parts this season, and I think the natural progression is goals and we are working on that one.</p>
      <p>‘You might see a big smile if he scores, not just from me but from the group because we know he has the quality to score and that will be the next step.’</p>
