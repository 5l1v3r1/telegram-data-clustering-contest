      <p>New Delhi: A Delhi court has sought response from the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Enforcement-Directorate">Enforcement Directorate</a> on the bail plea of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ratul-Puri">Ratul Puri</a>, nephew of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath, in a money laundering case related to the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/VVIP-chopper-scam">VVIP chopper scam</a>.</p>
      <p>Special Judge Arvind Kumar issued notice to the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ED">ED</a> and directed it to file a reply by November 22, when the court will next hear the matter.</p>
      <p>Puri moved the bail plea through advocate Vijay Agarwal on Saturday, saying he was not required for further investigation and no purpose will be served by keeping him in custody.</p>
      <p>The Enforcement Directorate recently filed a supplementary Prosecution Complaint against Ratul Puri and Jaspreet Ahuja in the Rs 600-crore <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/AgustaWestland-VVIP">AgustaWestland VVIP</a> chopper deal case.</p>
      <p>In January 2014, India had scrapped a contract with Finmeccanica's British subsidiary, Agustawestland, for supplying 12 VVIP choppers to the Indian Air Force, over alleged breach of contractual obligations and charges of kickbacks worth Rs 423 crore being paid to secure the deal.</p>
