      <p>David Villa started his Barcelona journey with a silverware, coming on as a substitute in the Spanish Super Cup win over Sevilla, which saw the beginning of the striker’s dominance.</p>
      <p>The forward’s combination with Argentine playmaker, Lionel Messi, paved the way to Barca’s La Liga’s 2011 and 2013 titles, a Copa del Rey victory, the 2011 Champions League trophy, a UEFA Super Cup, a FIFA Club World Cup, two Supercopa de España and  2011 Spanish Super Cup. Racking up eight trophies in three years under iconic Pep Guardiola and then the late Tito Vilanova.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard also scored 59 goals in 98 matches for Spain, including five at the 2010 World Cup, where Spain hoisted the World Cup trophy for the first time.</p>
      <p>The ex-Valencia finisher left Barcelona to join Athletico Madrid, where he won another La Liga title. Villa joined MLS side New York City in 2014, scoring 80 goals in 124 appearances, and later joined former Spain and Barcelona teammate Andres Iniesta at Japan’s Vissel Kobe.</p>

      <p>The forward made it three on the 55 minutes when Messi played an incredible pass between Carvalho and Pepe with a fantastic control by David Villa with a single touch followed by a powerful strike past Captain Casillas.</p>
      <p>The striker scored within 3 minutes, on 58 minutes, when the Argentine playmaker played the ball of the match to send Villa past the Los Blancos’ defenders in order to score through Casillas, marking his 10th goal for Blaugrana.</p>

      <p>SENSATIONAL GOAL!</p>
      <p>Messi passes the ball over to Villa as he pulls the defender towards him, sending the Spanish striker open to the right of the area. Villa cuts inside past Luna, and sends an outrageous left-footed curler past the Sevilla goalkeeper Varas and into the left corner of the goal.</p>

      <p>Arguably one of David Villa’s best strikes comes in a clash against Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup in 2011, as the Spaniard helps Barcelona equalize with an amazing shot past Sergio Ramos and Iker Casillas. He cuts to the right of an approaching Ramos and sends the ball right into the top right corner. Just Superb!</p>

      <p>The Spaniard in a recent interview with Cadena SER stated that his most favorite goal of all time is his goal against Manchester United in the finals of Champions League 2011.</p>
      <blockquote>”Because of all that it is: a Champions League Final, a rival like Manchester United, a stadium like Wembley, and it was also a really beautiful goal, no? And it gave us a sense of calm. We were up 2-1, and it was the 3-1 to seal the Champions League trophy. It’s a goal that combines a bit of everything.”<a href="https://www.foxsports.com.my/football/champions-league/120780/david-villa-names-barcelonas-ucl-final-goal-as-the-best-in-his-career/"><b> Villa said</b></a>.</blockquote>
