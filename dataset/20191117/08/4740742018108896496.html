      <h1>Bristol Bears linked with 72 cap Welsh international Justin Tipuric - reports</h1>
      <h2>Pat Lam is looking to build a squad which can compete in the Gallagher Premiership and Heineken Champions Cup</h2>

      <p>Bristol Bears might already have one of the best backrows in the Gallagher Premiership but the latest reports suggest director of rugby Pat Lam is looking to add one of the top opensides flankers in the world to his squad next season.</p>
      <p>The Rugby Paper reports 72 cap Welsh international Justin Tipuric has been handed a £500,000 a season offer from the Bears to switch the Ospreys for Bristol next season.</p>
      <p>Tipuric, 30, has spent his entire professional career at Ospreys but is out of contract at the end of the season according to the reports.</p>
      <p>The outstanding flanker, who also has one cap for the British and Irish Lions having been selected for the 2013 and 2017 tours, is also reportedly wanted by French Top 14 heavyweights Clermont Auvergne, Toulon and Toulouse which is potentially why the offer for the flanker is so high, if accurate.</p>
      <p>Lam has previously voiced his frustration at Bristol being used as a negotiating tool by agents to drive up the fee for players.</p>
      <p>Justin Tipuric’s representatives have denied a report suggesting the Wales and Ospreys forward is weighing up a £500,000-a-year offer to join Bristol Bears.</p>
      <p>However Wales Online report Tipuric’s agents at Win Sports Management say they haven’t received an enquiry from Bristol director of rugby Pat Lam or anyone connected with the club. </p>

      <p>Bristol Live understand the Bears are still well within their salary cap allowance leaving them with room to go after big name players as Lam looks to build a squad which can compete both in the league and in the European Heineken Cup which has been his very public goal.</p>
      <p>The Bears are currently top of the Gallagher Premiership and yesterday kicked off their European Challenge Cup campaign in spectacular fashion, beating Pro14 side Zebre 59-21 to top their pool.</p>
      <p>This summer Lam added England international Nathan Hughes to his backrow options, to play alongside former All Black Steven Luatua and one of last season's star performers Dan Thomas. All three players are in contract for at least next season.</p>
      <p>In 2017/18 Bristol brought in Australian backrow legend George Smith to add some experience and expertise to the backrow but he retired at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>With Tipuric having more than 60 caps for Wales he would still be eligible to play for his country if he moved away from the Pro14.</p>

      <p>Last season the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/wales-captain-alun-wyn-jones-3071187">Bears were linked with another Ospreys legend in Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones</a> but he eventually signed a new contract with the Welsh region.</p>
      <p>Transfer rumours are flying around in the rugby world at the moment and just last week<a href="https://www.therugbypaper.co.uk/features/34191/ellis-genge-set-to-snub-bristol-and-stay-a-leicester-tiger/"> The Rugby Paper</a> reported the Bears looked to have failed in their bid to re-sign Leicester Tigers and England prop Ellis Genge.</p>
      <p>Bristol-born Genge, 24, came through the academy at the Bears before moving to Tigers three years ago, initially on loan before the move was made permanent.</p>
      <p>According to Neil Fissler's Blindside column the Bears made an offer for the England loosehead to return to Ashton Gate next season but it fell short of expectations.</p>
