      <p><b>MINNEAPOLIS – </b>James Harden scored 49 points on a whopping 41 shots from the field and the undermanned Houston Rockets won their seventh straight gamer, 125-105 over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>With Russell Westbrook resting, the Rockets needed Harden to shoulder an even bigger scoring load than usual. The 41 attempts are the most in his career, and the most in the NBA this season, surpassing the 37 Golden State’s D’Angelo Russell took in an overtime loss Nov. 8 in the same building in Minnesota.</p>
      <p>Harden made 16 of the 41 shots, going 8 for 22 from 3-point range. He was 9 of 11 on free throws.</p>
      <p>Ben McLemore scored 20 points. Undrafted rookie Chris Clemons scored a career-high 19 for the Rockets, who broke open the game with a 9-0 run in the fourth quarter. Austin Rivers also had 19 points.</p>
      <p>Karl-Anthony Towns had 27 points and 15 rebounds for the Timberwolves.</p>

      <p>In San Antonio, CJ McCollum scored 32 points and Portland beat San Antonio to spoil Tim Duncan’s first shot at coaching following Gregg Popovich’s ejection.</p>
      <p>Popovich was ejected after walking onto the court to berate official Jason Goldenberg over a non-call. Popovich calmly walked off the court following his first ejection of the season.</p>
      <p>The Spurs responded with Duncan and fellow assistants Becky Hammon and Will Hardy coaching by committee, but it was Duncan calling the plays and screaming out instruction.</p>
      <p>Damian Lillard added 22 points and Hassan Whiteside had 21 for Portland.</p>
      <p>LaMarcus Aldridge had 30 points and 13 rebounds Spurs. They’ve lost five straight.</p>

      <p>The anticipated first game with George and Kawhi Leonard in the lineup together didn’t happen when Leonard sat out with a left knee contusion.</p>
      <p>But the Clippers didn’t need both of their new superstars on a night when George tied his career high with six 3-pointers and made all 11 of his free throws in the team’s biggest blowout of the young season.</p>

      <p>Myles Turner, playing his first game since Oct. 30, had 16 points, 11 rebounds and four blocks for Indiana.</p>

      <p>Doncic scored nine points in the fourth quarter as the Mavericks added to a one-point lead. He made all seven free throws in the quarter and finished with a career-best 15 free throws in 19 attempts.</p>
      <p>Delon Wright finished with 15 points, and banked in a fadeaway with 5 seconds left in the third quarter to send Dallas into the fourth quarter with a 78-77 edge. Wright added six points in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Kristaps Porzingis had 20 points and matched his career best with 15 rebounds for Dallas.</p>
