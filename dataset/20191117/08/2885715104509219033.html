      <p>The Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Vadodara police arrested one person in connection with theft of diesel from the fuel tankers of Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) and confiscated 510 litre of diesel from Kachariya village in the district. Police said that the accused, Suresh Upadhyay, had been selling diesel pilfered from the IOCL tankers with help of locals.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the SOG raided Upadhyay’s home in Dashrath Faliya of Kachariya village and confiscated two barrels and several cans, filled with 510 litre of diesel, meant for sale.</p>
      <p>The fuel was siphoned off from IOCL tankers parked in the vicinity of the refinery. According to the police, Upadhyay had been getting help from locals of the village who are mostly employed in class IV jobs at the refinery. A police statement confirmed that a further probe is on to investigate the involvement of others.</p>
      <p>“Upadhyay received the fuel from locals working in the refinery. He then brought the containers in his car to the village in order to sell it off,” the statement said. The police confirmed that they confiscated the fuel and mobile phones worth a total of Rs 39,000 from Upadhyay’s possession.</p>
      <p>This is not the first instance that Upadhyay has been arrested for fuel theft. He was also arrested in 2015.</p>
