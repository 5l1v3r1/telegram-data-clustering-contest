      <p>SALT LAKE CITY (<a href="https://kutv.com/news/entertainment/nicolas-cage-in-works-to-star-as-nicolas-cage-in-film-about-nicolas-cage">KUTV</a>) -- Yes, you read that right.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/nicolas-cage-star-as-nicolas-cage-unbearable-weight-massive-talent-1254626?f">a Friday article from The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the award-winning actor is apparently in negotiations with movie studio Lionsgate for a project about one of the most iconic characters in film history: himself.</p>

      <p>"The Unbreakable Weight of Massive Talent," a metadrama about the actor himself, follows Cage as he is "desperate to get a role in a new Tarantino movie while also dealing with a strained relationship with his teenage daughter," stated THR, and "occasionally talks to an egotistical 1990s version of himself who rides him for making too many crappy movies and for not being a star anymore."</p>
      <p>THR also reported that this Cage is also under some serious debt and finds himself with the likes of a Mexican billionaire, who turns out to be a drug cartel kingpin and is recruited by the U.S. government to get intel on the man. The story is described to be "meta" and includes nods and references to some of the actor's famous roles, including "Leaving Las Vegas," "Face-Off" and "Gone in 60 Seconds."</p>

      <p>According to sources who spoke with THR, the script was shown to Cage and was accompanied with a letter from director and screenwriter Tom Gormican, who wrong and directed "That Awkward Moment" with Zac Efron, Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller. THR stated the letter pleaded his case for the film and how the project is meant to be a "love letter" to the actor and not something that would parody him. Cage was convinced and became attached only in the recent weeks, according to THR.</p>
      <p>The interest in "The Unbreakable Weight of Massive Talent" was so high that sources also told THR that Cage is lining up to achieve a payday that would put him in the same range as he was in when he made the hit films "Con Air" and "National Treasure."</p>
