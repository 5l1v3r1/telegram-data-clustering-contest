      <p>More than 36,000 people in the North East are classed as alcohol dependent yet only one residential rehab centre in the region remains open, new figures have revealed.</p>
      <p>Freedom of Information requests show that in 2013 there were six publicly-funded residential drug and alcohol rehab facilities across the North East, but only one remains active.</p>
      <p>The closure rate of 83% is the worst in the country according to privately-run UK Addiction Treatment (UKAT).</p>
      <p>Public Health England figures have revealed that the number of adults living across the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/">North East</a> dependent on alcohol is reported at 36,711 in 2017/18, rising from 34,970 back in 2010.</p>
      <p>That's a rate of 17 per 1,000 adults living in the region that are dependent on alcohol.</p>
      <p>UKAT’s analysis of the report shows five councils areas across the North East saw a small reduction the number of people dependent on alcohol, including <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/county-durham">County Durham</a> , Darlington, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead">Gateshead</a> , Middlesbrough and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-tyneside">North Tyneside</a> .</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, UKAT lodged a Freedom of Information Request to see how many publicly-funded residential drug and alcohol rehab facilities had closed down since councils took responsibility for the Public Health Grant in 2013.</p>
      <p>Their results show that across the North East, there were six rehabs available to treat people with alcohol dependence back in 2013, and now, only one remains active.</p>
      <p>UKAT’s Group Treatment Lead, Nuno Albuquerque, said: "Unfortunately, alcohol is just as harmful a drug than heroin is, but a lot of people don’t or don’t want to see it that way.</p>
      <p>"Councils across the North East assumed lead responsibility for alcohol service provision back in 2013, giving them full autonomy of how and where they spend their annual Public Health Grant, yet the numbers of people dependent on alcohol and in need of treatment is rising instead of falling.</p>
      <p>“Patient care at these particular residential rehabs is in the main, funded by councils. If the councils decide to opt for other - more than likely, cheaper - types of care for their patients, like community day centres, then these facilities lack vital funding and over time, have ceased operation.</p>
      <p>"Quite simply, greater investment in effective treatment facilities, accessibility and awareness will help lower the number of people in this community suffering with alcohol dependence.”</p>
      <p>Alcohol dependence is a syndrome characterised by a strong and sometimes overpowering desire to drink, which may take priority over other previously valued activities.</p>
      <p>The analysis of alcohol dependence prevalence is calculated using local hospital admission rates for alcohol dependence or withdrawal, local authority population data and results from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS).</p>
