      <h1>Iker Casillas claims Cristiano Ronaldo should not win 2019 Ballon d’Or</h1>

        <b>Former Real Madrid goalkeeper and teammate of Cristiano Ronaldo, Iker Casillas has claimed that the Portuguese legend does not really deserve to win the 2019 <i>Ballon d’Or</i> award.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ronaldo, who has previously won the prestigious award five times – same as Lionel Messi – is back in contention this year, to add a sixth <i>Ballon d’O</i>r to his collection. As usual, Messi is one of his opponents, while Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk has also been tipped to win the award.</p>
      <p>In every one of the past twelve years or so, Ronaldo had remained a serious contender for the <i>Ballon d’Or</i> – but unfortunately, this time he is said to be below Messi and van Dijk in the pecking order.</p>
      <p>And Casillas also feels that the 34-year-old winning the 2019 Ballon d’Or would be illogical, as the others are considered to be more deserving than the Juventus star.</p>
      <p>“Van Dijk was the best player for UEFA. Messi was the best for FIFA. Imagine – if Cristiano wins the <i>Ballon d’Or</i>, it would seem to me that the guidelines we follow in football to give prizes do not have much logic, right? Friday reflection. #HappyWeekend,” the 2010 FIFA World Cup winner took to Twitter to express his opinion.</p>
      <p>Check out the tweet below:</p>

      <p>Messi and Ronaldo first entered the final <i>Ballon d’Or </i>shortlist, in 2007 – when Kaka won the award.</p>
      <p>In the ten years that followed, both players lifted five <i>Ballon d’Or</i>‘s each, and their monopoly was finally broken by Real Madrid’s Luka Modric last year.</p>
      <p>Will Virgil van Dijk be able to beat them to the award this year? All we can do right now, is to wait and watch.</p>
