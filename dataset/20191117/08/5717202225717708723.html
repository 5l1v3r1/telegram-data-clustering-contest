      <h1>Report: Everton want Sheffield United defender John Egan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:45:17+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jordanharris/" target="_blank">Jordan Harris</a></address>

        <b><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/">According to a report from The Sun on Sunday (17/11; page 67)</a>, Everton are monitoring Sheffield United defender John Egan and plan to watch the centre-back play for Republic of Ireland on Monday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is little surprise that Marco Silva is keen to sign a new defender in January. The Toffees look to be extremely light in that area of the field. And it is only the five teams below them in the Premier League table who have conceded more goals.</p>

      <p>The Blades meanwhile, boast the second-best record in the division. And Egan has played a key role in their success. Chris Wilder’s men have conceded just nine goals and sit fifth in the table.</p>
      <p>Egan has started all 12 league games since United returned to England’s top table. He appeared 44 times last year as his first season at Bramall Lane culminated in automatic-promotion.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/">The Sun on Sunday (17/11; page 67) reports</a> that Everton are interested in signing the 27-year-old and plan to watch how he gets on in a back four when Republic of Ireland face Denmark next week.</p>
      <p>The report notes however, that Sheffield United will likely demand a ‘fortune’ for the former Brentford man. So it does not look set to be a simple chase for Everton.</p>
      <h3>TBR View</h3>
      <p>Everton certainly need to target a new centre-back in January. And Egan’s form at the start of this season suggests that he could be a very shrewd addition.</p>
      <p>Despite the Blades’ success, it may be a good time to take a look at Wilder’s men. They are still going somewhat under the radar and probably will not get the full credit they deserve once the season reaches the business end.</p>
      <p>That does not necessarily mean that United will make it any easier for Everton to land Egan. But perhaps, the Toffees will attempt to agree a lower price before Wilder’s side really receive the plaudits they deserve.</p>
