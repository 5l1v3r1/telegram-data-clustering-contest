      <h1>Report: Arsenal and Manchester United want Brad Young</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/">According to a report from The Sun on Sunday (17/11; page 67)</a>, Arsenal and Manchester United are both interested in Hartlepool United goalkeeper Brad Young.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Young is yet to make his senior debut for the National League side. However, Pools have shown that they have high hopes for the 17-year-old by handing him his first professional contract earlier this year.</p>

But it appears that he may soon be the subject of offers from much higher up the pyramid.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/">The Sun on Sunday (17/11; page 67) reports</a> that the Gunners and Red Devils have both been tracking Young, who has been called up by England at youth level.</p>

      <p>The report notes that the non-league side are set to want a decent fee for the goalkeeper.</p>
      <h3>TBR View</h3>
      <p>It is difficult to imagine either club being put off by Hartlepool’s asking price if they see something in Young. Whatever his side want could prove to be a real bargain if he realises the potential that both Arsenal and Manchester United believe he could have.</p>
      <p>Young however, would be forgiven for seriously considering staying put, even if Arsenal or Manchester United come calling. He is still developing, and may want to be at a club which provides the quickest route towards the first-team.</p>
      <p>Of course, a move to the Emirates or Old Trafford would be incredibly difficult to turn down.</p>
