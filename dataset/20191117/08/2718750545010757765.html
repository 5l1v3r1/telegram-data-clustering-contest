      <p><i>Saturday Night Live</i> ventured back into the delightful waters of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/snl-hero-dog-sketch-with-cecily-strong-video.html">dog-themed sketches</a> with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL4kcGiqWmw">“Joan Song,”</a> a sweet, charmingly loopy ode from Aidy Bryant to her dog-boyfriend, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/05/its-time-to-take-harry-styles-seriously.html">Harry Styles</a>. We never thought we would be typing those words in that order, either, but here we are. Aidy Bryant stars as Joan, a long-suffering woman whose boyfriend was cheating on her (shame on you, Steve), before she found a hot new guy, er, dog. Joan introduces us to a chubby chihuahua shortly before he transforms into pop sensation Harry Styles, and it all makes sense in a strange, dream-logic kind of way. And don’t worry, there is indeed a bestiality disclaimer. Even if all of that doesn’t quite sound like your cup of tea, there’s also Harry Styles in a dog collar to consider.</p>
