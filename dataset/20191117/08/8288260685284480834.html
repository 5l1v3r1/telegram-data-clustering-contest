      <p>Strictly fans have been left gutted after the result for Sunday evening's show was leaked on social media - AGAIN.</p>
      <p>Viewers of the BBC One talent contest were left seething after some Twitter users spoiled the results from Blackpool.</p>
      <p>Strictly Come Dancing films its Sunday night results show on Saturday evenings, meaning leaks often occur.</p>
      <p>But this week's has left fans particularly annoyed - after a crowd favourite was axed.</p>
      <p>The contestant, widely seen as a potential finalist, was voted off the show after the judges opted to save a rival contestant.</p>

      <p>One tweeted: "Absolutely gutted #StrictlySpoiler."</p>
      <p>While another commented: "Noooooooo #StrictlySpoiler."</p>
      <p>Social media was awash with other angry comments, too, with one branding the contestant a "finalist" - and another saying: "Totally wrong."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"I shouldn't have searched #StrictlySpoiler. My life is over", one tweeted.</p>
      <p>And another remarked: "Nah you’re joking me #StrictlySpoiler."</p>
      <p>Another raged: "I AM F***ING FUMING #StrictlySpoiler."</p>
      <p>Fans will have to wait until tonight to discover the remaining celebs' fate, as well as watch a huge Westlife performance.</p>
