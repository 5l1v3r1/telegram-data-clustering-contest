      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-styles/">Harry Styles</a> hosted Saturday Night Live for the first time last night and wasted no time in dissing his former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/one-direction/">One Direction</a> bandmate <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/zayn-malik/">Zayn Malik</a>.</p>
      <p>In his opening monologue, the 25-year-old singer briefly discussed the group going their separate ways in 2015 before snubbing the Dusk Till Dawn artist as he hailed Niall Horan, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/liam-payne/">Liam Payne</a> and Louis Tomlinson as his ‘brothers’.</p>
      <p>Showing off his comedic side, Harry began: ‘I don’t know if you heard or not, I’m not in a boyband anymore. I’m in a man band now.’</p>

      <p>He continued: ‘I was in a band called One Direction, how crazy would it be if they were here tonight? Well, they’re not. Wouldn’t it be crazy if they were though? They’re not.</p>
      <p>‘I love those guys, they’re my brothers.  Niall, Liam, Louis… and Ringo. Yeah, that’s it.’</p>

      <p>Harry then quipped: ‘I’m just so grateful Simon Cowell grew us in those test tubes.’</p>
      <p>Viewers really couldn’t handle the shade Harry threw at Zayne and rushed to Twitter in shock, with one writing: ‘HE REALLY JUST DID ZAYN LIKE THAT WOAH #SNL.’</p>

      <p>Elsewhere in his opening speech, Harry said: ‘You know for me, it’s not about the fame or the money. It’s about the music, it’s about the art. It’s about the art and the music and the music and the art.</p>
      <p>‘I believe that music is a universal language. Especially songs that are performed in English because that’s the only language that I understand. ‘</p>

      <p>Once he’d opened the show, Harry was joined by a number of A-list guests including Jon Hamm.</p>
      <p>Aidy Bryan also starred in a pre-recorded music video which saw her play a newly-single woman living with her chihuahua Doug, with whom she has a romantic relationship with.</p>
      <p>Then in the most unexpected twist, Harry transformed into the pooch and began duetting with Aidy.</p>
      <p>Honestly, between that and the Zayn shade, we’ll be haunted forever.</p>
