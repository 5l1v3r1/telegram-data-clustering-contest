      <p>Police said that the programme, ‘Nathuram Balidan Diwas’, in which over a dozen people were present, was organised without obtaining permission from the district administration, while <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-is-section-144-crpc-jammu-and-kashmir-5878543/">Section 144</a> of CrPC was invoked in the city.</p>

      <p>Police said, the accused, while talking to media, stated that it is not Mahatma Gandhi, but Godse who is the main hero of the nation.</p>
      <p>Shankdhar was produced before a local court of Bareilly, which sent him to jail, said Circle Officer, City, Ashok Kumar Singh.</p>
      <p>He added raids are being conducted to trace the other accused in the case.</p>
      <p>According to police, Shankdhar and his supporters observed the death anniversary of Gandhiji’s assassin Godse at Seth Damodar Swaroop Park of the city. “We were informed that while talking to media, Krishna Kumar made objectionable comments against Mahatma Gandhi. We collected information about the matter and also verified the speech, “ said SHO of City Kotwali police station, Gitesh Kapil, adding that Shankdhar also runs Agastya Muni Ashram located in Quila area of Bareilly city.</p>
