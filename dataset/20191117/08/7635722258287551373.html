        <b>Today</b>
      </p>
      <p>Patchy light rain and drizzle in parts this morning - heaviest over Ulster - but most areas dry with any frost and mist clearing.</p>
      <p>The rain and drizzle will peter out through the morning and early afternoon as skies clear to give a mostly dry day with good spells of sunshine.</p>
      <p>There will however, be the odd shower lingering through parts of Ulster and also later on the south Leinster coast.</p>
      <p>Maximum temperatures today of 6 to 8°C in a light to moderate northerly breeze.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tonight</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dry and very cold tonight with clear skies and light winds.</p>
      <p>There will be a widespread sharp frost with minimum temperatures of zero to minus 4°C, although temperatures may hold a degree or two higher on the east coast in a light onshore northeasterly breeze.</p>
      <p>Fog may also form inland.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tomorrow</b>
      </p>
      <p>A dry and crisp start to Monday with early morning sunshine helping to clear the frost and fog.</p>
      <p>Remaining dry and mostly sunny through the day, however cloud will slowly build from the west later.</p>
      <p>Temperatures reaching 5 to 8°C after a cold start.</p>
      <p>Light mostly easterly winds, veering southeasterly later and becoming fresh to strong on the west coast.</p>
