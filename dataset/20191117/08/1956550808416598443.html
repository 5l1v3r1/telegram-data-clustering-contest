      <p><a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/kids/381534-tania%E2%80%99s-teahouse-review">Tania's Teahouse</a> is ringing in <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/kids/christmas">Christmas</a> with some fun festive treats – and kids and fur babies are invited too.<br/><br/>Now that the cooler weather is upon us, restaurants and cafés around the city are opening their terraces and gardens so we can all enjoy eating al fresco.<br/><br/>But Tania's Teahouse is going one step further and inviting customers of the four-legged variety to come along as well.<br/><br/>Pampered pooches can chill in the sun while human mums, dads and siblings can tuck into the fun sweet treats that are being laid on for Christmas.<br/><br/>The pretty pink café has thrown open the doors on its recently renovated – and more Instagrammable than ever – terrace where new wall art and foliage will provide the perfect backdrop to those family selfies.<br/><br/>Social media taken care of, it's time to tuck into the cookie selection – themed for the holidays with snowmen, gingerbread houses and Christmas trees that are almost too cute to eat... almost.<br/><br/>And if you can't get enough of the cookies while you're there, you can load up a box to take home.<br/><br/>Like the biscuits, the hot drinks – all with the usual play on words names we've come to expect at the Jumeirah eatery – are festively themed too.<br/><br/>For the smalls, there is every child's dreamy winter drink, hot chocolate – luckily the snow doesn't need to be coming down outside to enjoy it.<br/><br/>There are more grown-up options available too – although to be honest, the S'mores the Merrier hot chocolate with marshmallows wins it for us even though we are (slightly) above 15.<br/><br/>'Teas the Season is everything you want to make you feel warm and cosy – yes, even though it's still 25 degrees outside – with cinnamon, cloves, jasmine petals and xmas-themed candy sprinkles, while a homemade gingerbread latte sounds truly tempting.<br/><br/>And if you really want to get the in the mood for <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/christmas/422588-christmas-2019-pets-delight-launches-a-festive-range-for-dogs-and-cats-in-the-uae">Christmas</a> - dress your doggie in a festive outfit... cute Santa hat anyone?<br/><br/>Grab the fam – and the pooch – and we'll see you there.<br/><i>Daily 10am-6pm.
