      <p><i>The Crown</i>'s third season introduces viewers to a new, grown-up version of Prince Charles and plants the seeds for his eventual marriage to Princess Diana. But before her, there was another woman: <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29601605/prince-charles-camilla-parker-bowles-relationship-timeline/">Camilla Shand, whose relationship with Charles</a> is by far his longest. <i>The Crown</i> delves into the start of their romance — and how quickly it went downhill.</p>
      <p>There are differing reports about how Camilla and Charles met. Some say the two met at a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4410551.stm">polo match in 1970</a>, and others say the daughter of a former Chilean ambassador named <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/4959269/Prince-Charles-takes-Camilla-to-lunch-with-first-girlfriend-in-Chile.html">Lucia Santa Cruz introduced them in 1971</a>, believing the duo to be a well-suited match. However it happened, their relationship didn't initially last long; as <i>The Crown</i> shows, Charles was soon stationed abroad with the Navy. E! News calls the move <a href="https://www.eonline.com/ap/news/1093301/from-other-woman-to-crowned-duchess-inside-prince-charles-and-camilla-s-epic-love-story">"Charles' decision,"</a> but <i>The Crown</i> insinuates it was part of a ploy by the royal family to force the couple apart, likely because of the alleged letters Lord Mountbatten sent Charles discouraging him from marrying Camilla</p>
      <p>According to <i>Marie Claire</i>, Penny Junor's book <i>The Firm: The Troubled Life of the House of Windsor</i> quotes one <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=SenE90h9snAC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=%22I+think+it+is+disturbing+for+women+to+have+experiences+if+they+have+to+remain+on+a+pedestal+after+marriage.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=REWv7MvNXT&amp;sig=ACfU3U0-Uh8cSd4MiE1gTd8VndsvLa464w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwix0dbW9tPlAhUw1lkKHQObAa0Q6AEwCnoECBkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20think%20it%20is%20disturbing%20for%20women%20to%20have%20experiences%20if%20they%20have%20to%20remain%20on%20a%20pedestal%20after%20marriage.%22&amp;f=false">alleged letter from Lord Mountbatten as saying</a>, "The man should sow his wild oats and have as many affairs as he can before settling down, but for a wife he should choose a suitable, attractive, and sweet-charactered girl before she has met anyone else she might fall for."</p>

      <p>Camilla, in addition to not having a royal lineage, had also engaged with other men before meeting Prince Charles — notably <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1180029/camilla-parker-bowles-engagement-prince-charles-affair-wedding">British Army officer Andrew Parker Bowles</a>, who would later become her husband. Before watching <i>The Crown</i>, some viewers may have assumed that Camilla married Andrew <i>after</i> Charles and Diana got together, but Camilla and Andrew had a romance of their own before she even met Charles.</p>
      <p>When Charles went away to the Navy, Camilla ultimately accepted a proposal from Andrew and the two wed in 1973. According to the <i>Express</i>, they then <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1184501/princess-anne-news-andrew-parker-bowles-camilla-parker-bowles-prince-charles-spt">had a son and daughter</a> in 1974 and 1978, respectively. <i>The Crown</i> Season 3 takes viewers up to 1977, but only includes Camilla's wedding — not mentioning (at least not yet) her children. What <i>The Crown</i> does cover, however, is a fling between Princess Anne and Andrew Parker Bowles before he married Camilla. According to the <i>Express</i>, that seems to be true to life, but Anne and Andrew couldn't marry because he was Catholic — not that they were necessarily that serious. Today, Anne and Andrew remain good friends, and were seen together as recently as 2018<i>.</i></p>

      <p>Eventually, Camilla and Andrew <a href="https://www.insider.com/prince-charles-camilla-relationship-timeline-2018-11">filed for divorce in 1994</a>, stating that they'd already been living separately for years. This came on the heels of a rekindled <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/princess-diana-discovered-prince-charles-affair-with-camilla-parker-bowles-in-the-most-devastating-way-12105858">relationship between Charles and Camilla</a> that occurred while he was still married to Diana, and in 1996, Charles and Diana divorced as well. A decade later, in 2005, Charles and Camilla were finally married.</p>
      <p>"With hindsight, you can say that Charles should have married Camilla when he first had the chance," <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/1154324/camilla-parker-bowles-duchess-of-cornwall-prince-charles-birthday-young-pictures">Charles' godmother Patricia Mountbatten</a> is quoted as saying in <i>Charles and Camilla: Portrait of a Love Affair.</i> "They were ideally suited, we know that now. But it wasn't possible."</p>
      <p>If only it had been, so much trouble could have been avoided.</p>
