      <p>Ever since his return from his sabbatical, Kapil Sharma has been making a lot of noise with his hilarious content on The Kapil Sharma Show, striking chords just right every week with the audiences. This week marks the appearance of the <i>Pagalpanti</i> cast on the show including Arshad Warsi, John Abraham, Urvashi Rautela, Anil Kapoor amongst others. But Kapil abruptly asked Arshad to leave his show! Here’s why</p>
      <p>In one of the promo recently released by Sony TV, Kapil could be seen flirting with Urvashi Rautela, who hits back at him in a similar tone. Soon, Arshad Warsi gets up and asks them to continue their flirting while the rest of the cast will take a leave. To this, Kapil abruptly shows him the direction to the exit, and the entire cast along with host Archana Puran Singh and the audience bursts into laughter.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Kapil recently indulged in a fun Twitter banter with Akshay Kumar who’s gearing up for the release of his upcoming comedy-drama, Good Newwz. He also took the internet by storm when he dressed up as the previous host Navjot Singh Sidhu.</p>
      <p>Kapil dressed up as former permanent guest Navjot Singh Sidhu and took a dig at his new guest and actress Archana Puran Singh.</p>
      <p>Kapil was seen wearing a blue turban with an orange kurta and a blue jacket. He recited a few lines for current guest Archana Puran Singh, who replaced Sidhu on the show after his exit.</p>
      <p>In the video, Kapil says “Mohtarma Archana tumhare liye do line kahna chahta hun: ‘Mera ladka, mera ladka, main hu uska baap’. Bhai meri kursi chheen li tumne, tumko lagega paap.”</p>
      <p>He captioned it: “Jus for #fun guys #navjotsinghsidhu @archanapuransingh #comedy #fun #laughter #thekapilsharmashow #tkss.”</p>
      <p>The video currently has 1,997,594 likes on Instagram.</p>
