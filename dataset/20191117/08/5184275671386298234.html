      <p><b>Marjaavaan Box Office:</b><i> Marjaavaan</i> is continuing to be on the right path as far as box office moolah is concerned. After bringing in <b>7.03 crores</b> on Friday, the film stayed on the same levels on Saturday too with <b>7.21 crores</b> coming in.</p>

      <p>The Milap Zaveri directed film has accumulated <b>14.24 crores</b> already and that too on the basis of lower-priced tickets at the centers where it is collecting most. The footfalls for the film are better than a core multiplex film which would have collected close to <b>17 crores</b> in these two days and that puts the reach of <i>Marjaavaan</i> in an even better perspective.</p>
      <p>The Sidharth Malhotra and Riteish Deshmukh starrer’s immediate target is former’s <i>Kapoor &amp; Sons</i> which had brought in <b>26.35 crores</b> in its opening weekend. Once that happens, it would be a reason good enough for Nikkhil Advani and his Emmay Entertainment to come up with an even broader smile.</p>
      <p>Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources</p>
