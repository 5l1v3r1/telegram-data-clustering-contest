      <p>Jobabo, Las Tunas.- The ranchón near the crocodile farm is almost finished. It is still needed the conditioning of the Boca de Jobabo biological station, to build another small ranchón where the route through the estuaries begins, and a kind of pier or passage to circumvent, the rest of the infrastructure progresses at a good pace despite not have all the resources.</p>
      <p>The specialists are also getting ready for the management of the area in conditions of nature tourism. They have carefully conceived the options and values of the area that can be made known without affecting the ecosystem, explains the Master in Science Manuel López, in charge of research on waterfowl.</p>
      <p>Lopez said that it is planned to make a platform, with a walkway that takes visitors to the observation site from where they can see species such as flamingo and long-billed curlews, which they know with the breeding plumage; and here they can appreciate the change of it according to other stages of life.</p>
      <p>Doctor in Science Manuel Alonso Tabet, principal biologist of Monte Cabaniguán and founder of the protected area, pointed out that when venturing into tourist activity, wildlife monitoring should be increased. He clarified that according to the behavior of the trail, more or less visitors will enter. He referred to the different options; among which the nautical route stood out, which requires resources such as the improvement of the boat park.</p>
