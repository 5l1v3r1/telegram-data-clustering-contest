      <h1>Kamil Miazek’s performance in humiliating 7-1 loss must be a wake-up call for Leeds United</h1>
      <h2>Leeds United need to consider new recruits if Kiko Casilla does receive a lengthy ban.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:45:09+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United have something of a problem hanging over their heads regarding goalkeeper Kiko Casilla. The Spaniard has been charged with racially abusing an opponent and, as reported by <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7640667/Kiko-Casilla-set-handed-lengthy-ban-alleged-racial-slur-Jonathan-Leko.html">the Daily Mail, </a>could be facing a lengthy 12 game ban.</p>
      <p>This summer saw Leeds sell former first-choice keeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell to Burnley but they will feel Ilan Meslier is an adequate replacement. The Frenchman, on loan from Lorient, is highly-rated and will hopefully step up to the plate if called upon. </p>
      <p>However, Leeds will surely need to consider bringing in a new keeper if Casilla’s ban does indeed take effect. </p>

      <p>That was made abundantly clear by the performance of the Leeds under-23s against Derby County in midweek. The Whites were thrashed 7-1 by the Rams and Leeds number three Kamil Miazek had a game to forget.  </p>
      <p>The 6 foot 5 inches Polish stopper did not cover himself in glory for several of the Derby goals. On top of that, his play from the back was reckless and inaccurate. It was a sure sign that he would not be able to step up to first-team duties if Meslier became incapacitated during Casilla’s potential exit. </p>
      <p>Will Huffer is also at the club but it is clear he is not seen as a long-term option for the Leeds first-team. </p>
      <p>Bringing in a goalkeeper just seems the safest option for Leeds going forward. With options like Jordan Archer, Emiliano Viviano and Jakob Haugaard available for free, Leeds would not even have to wait until January. </p>
      <p>If Casilla is banned, Meslier is undoubtedly worth trusting. But if the Frenchman ends up being unavailable, Leeds need another option. </p>
