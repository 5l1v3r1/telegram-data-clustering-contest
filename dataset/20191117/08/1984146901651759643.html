      </figure>
      <p>Hundreds of people turned up to polling stations ready to cast their vote - only to find out they weren't registered.</p>
      <p>Figures released by the Electoral Commission show that in the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/general-election">June 2017 election</a>, 708 people across the North East had forgotten or didn't realise they needed to register.</p>
      <p>This represented a slight improvement on 2015, when 779 people who thought they were registered found out they weren’t on election day.</p>
      <p>The numbers in 2017 included 93 in North West Durham, 88 in North Durham and 116 people in Bishop Auckland, one of the highest numbers in the UK.</p>
      <p>Across the country, returning officers reported that approximately 10,500 individuals tried to vote on election day despite not being registered. However, this data is "inconsistently reported" and not all constituencies fully shared this data, so the numbers could in fact be higher.</p>
      <p>An Electoral Commission spokesperson said: “Registering to vote is quick and easy. It only takes a few minutes to fill out an application form or to check details are correct on the electoral register – which is particularly relevant for those that have recently moved house.</p>
      <p>“November 26 is the deadline for the 2019 General Election so it’s important that everyone eligible is correctly registered by then to ensure they can cast their vote in the upcoming poll.”</p>
      <p>The deadline to register for the upcoming election is 11:59pm on November 26.</p>
      <p>You can check if you’re on the electoral register with the electoral registration officer at your local council.</p>
      <p>If you are registered to vote and you arrive at a polling station before polls close at 10pm, you’ll be able to vote, even if you have to wait in a queue to do so.</p>
      <p>This happened to 137 people across the UK who were queuing at 10pm for the 2017 election. <br/>However, if you join the queue or arrive at the polling station after 10pm, you won’t be able to vote - this affected nine people in 2017.</p>
