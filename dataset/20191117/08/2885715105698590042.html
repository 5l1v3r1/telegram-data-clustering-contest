      <p>A soldier of the Indian Army was allegedly killed by his wife, who dumped his body near Khed Shivapur area on Pune-Satara Road with the help of her paramour. The soldier, Sanjay Bhosale (40), was murdered on November 7.</p>
      <p>Police have arrested four persons in connection with the case including Sanjay’s wife Sheetal (29), her paramour Yogesh Kadam (29) and two of his alleged accomplices, Manish Madane (32) and Rahul Kale (35).</p>
      <p>Sanjay was posted in Assam and had come home for a vacation recently. He and his wife Sheetal had an argument because he suspected her of having an affair with Yogesh Kadam, said police. Sanjay decided to shift houses and he and his wife moved to a residential society in Rahatani area.</p>
      <p>Upset by these developments, Sheetal allegedly hatched a conspiracy with Yogesh to kill her husband. Yogesh, a pharmacy graduate, gave a poison suspected to be sodium cyanide to Sheetal, said police.</p>
      <p>Sheetal allegedly mixed the poison with water and gave it to Sanjay, killing him. Later, Yogesh and his aides Manish and Rahul hired a private car to dispose of Sanjay’s body on the side of the road near Khed Shivapur, which is in the jurisdiction of Rajgad police station of Pune Rural Police.</p>
      <p>Sanjay’s body was discovered on November 8, and police started investigating the calls and messages between him and his wife. Police also called Sheetal in for questioning. During further investigation, Sheetal confessed that she had killed her husband with the help of Yogesh.</p>
      <p>She and the three others were arrested. A court has remanded the four accused to police custody till November 19.</p>
      <p>Sheetal and Sanjay have two children, a 10-year-old boy and an 8-year-old girl.</p>
