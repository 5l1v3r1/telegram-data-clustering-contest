      <p>The Afghan government has reconsidered decision to swap three senior leaders of the Haqqani terrorist network with the American University lecturers.</p>
      <p>Presidential spokesperson Sediq Sediqqi said late on Saturday that Anas Haqqani, Mali Khan and Hafiz Rashid, the three senior Haqqani network leaders are still in the custody of the Afghan government.</p>
      <p>Sediqqi blamed the postponement of the prisoners swap, claiming that the group failed to respect the conditions of the process.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Sediqqi said the Afghan government has reconsidered decision and will take further actions in the light of the interests and benefits of Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani on Tuesday announced that the government is intending to release the three senior Haqqani network leaders in exchange for the release of the two American University lecturers.</p>
      <p>The Taliban group kidnapped the two American University lecturers from West of Kabul city in August of 2016.</p>
