      <h1>48 reasons why marrying a Scouser will be your best decision yet</h1>
      <h2>After reading this you may be adding an engagement ring to your Christmas wish list</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/catherine-murphy/" target="_blank">Catherine Murphy</a></address>
      <p>We all know it - S<a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/25-reasons-proud-scouse-14753963">cousers are the best</a> - but what can you expect when you marry one?</p>
      <p>We're generous, we've got great dress sense, we're loyal and we're a handsome bunch. Do you need any more reasons to make a Merseysider your partner of life?</p>
      <p>Earlier this year the ECHO published 48 reasons why you should definitely marry a Scouser.</p>
      <p>And now, with Christmas fast approaching - the perfect time for a proposal - we thought it would be the ideal moment to take a look at all those reasons again.</p>
      <h4>1. You'll always be guaranteed a laugh</h4>
      <p>After all, you just can't beat the Scouse sense of humour, no matter how harsh it may seem at times.</p>
      <h4>2. Because everyone knows people from Liverpool are the funniest</h4>
      <p>It's true, trust us.</p>
      <h4>3. You get the chance to learn another language</h4>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>We could fill a whole dictionary of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-sayings-top-26-things-6463028">words which are either completely unique</a> to Liverpool or have a totally different meaning here in the city.</p>
      <h4>4. As well as realising the importance of your wheelie bin</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article15941225.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS169526956.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>We're not sure anywhere else in the UK you'd find people taking a sense of pride in the colour of their wheelie bin.</p>
      <p>Got a purple one? Then you'll be classed as a true scouser.</p>
      <h4>5. You're always guaranteed a roast dinner</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article13793412.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_IMG_7006JPG.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It just would not be a Sunday without one.</p>
      <h4>6. Or a good pan of Scouse</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article15894988.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_JS176280387.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It's a speciality here in Liverpool, and it just what you need on a cold day. Especially with crusty bread!</p>
      <h4>7. You'll always be kept on your toes</h4>
      <p>At least your life will never be boring married to one.</p>
      <h4>8. You'll be spoilt for choice when it comes to 'date nights'</h4>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The city is filled with the perfect venues for anyone looking to organise a date. Whether it be a posh meal, a 'proper' pub, or a round of crazy golf - the possibilities are practically endless.</p>
      <h4>9. Or 'date days' for that matter</h4>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Goodness Gracious rooftop garden</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Even a walk around one of the city's parks would be an ideal date, on a sunny day Liverpool has plenty of beer gardens and rooftop bars you can visit to take in the views.</p>
      <h4>10. You'll never be short of conversation</h4>
      <p>We're chatterboxes and always have plenty of stories to tell.</p>
      <h4>11. Although you'll probably struggle to get a word in edge ways</h4>
      <p>We love to talk, but at least we're honest about it.</p>
      <h4>12. You'll be safe in the knowledge your partner will always be the best dressed</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article15941237.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_JS148780789.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>This is one of the things the city is known for. Scouse men and women are always the best dressed, you can always spot Scousers in a crowd.</p>
      <p>You only need to look at pictures from <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/ladies-day-aintree">Aintree's Grand National</a> to see what we mean.</p>
      <h4>13. And you'll learn to love football and the importance of being either a red or blue</h4>
      <p>Scouse men in Liverpool always have football in common. And the only thing more awkward than someone who says they don't like football is someone who says they don't support Liverpool or Everton. Just pick one.</p>
      <h4>14. Scousers are always the most generous, especially at the bar</h4>
      <p>This is one we notice time and time again.</p>
      <p>When it comes to getting a round in it is almost always guaranteed it'll be a Scouser offering.</p>
      <h4>15. They'll make holiday mates every time you go away together</h4>
      <p>There is something exciting about being thousands of miles away from the city and hearing another Scouse accent. You've just got to stop and chat.</p>
      <h4>16. And, you'll get the chance to live in the best city in the world</h4>
      <figure>

      <p>We'll leave this one here.</p>
      <h4>17. Meaning you wake up to the best views, like this ...</h4>

      </figure>
      <h4>19. You won't need to worry about the in-laws because you'll practically be considered family before you're married anyway</h4>
      <p>A Scouser's family is a big deal</p>
      <h4>20. Because guaranteed even on the first date they'll tell you about their family members as if you already know who they are</h4>
      <p>"And then our Tracey did this..." It doesn't matter that you don't know who Tracey actually is.</p>
      <h4>21. You'll learn how different Scousers are compared to everyone else</h4>
      <p>We're a breed apart. Scouse not English.</p>
      <h4>22. And realise the majority of what they say is sarcastic</h4>
      <p>It may take a while to get used to, but almost everything we say is sarcastic. It's rare that we are ever serious so you'll need to learn not to be easily offended.</p>
      <h4>23. But also how straight talking they really are (you'll always know where you stand)</h4>
      <p>If a Scouser has something to say to you, you can bet that they will say it.</p>
      <h4>24. And, they are loyal</h4>
      <p>We always have each others backs.</p>
      <p>There is also the other type of loyalty, which Scouse girls will know all about.</p>
      <h4>25. They are annoyingly, always so clever</h4>
      <p>Ever watched an episode of The Chase with a Scouser? They know the most random stuff.</p>
      <h4>26. And, then there is how good a Scouse lad looks in grey tracky bottoms?</h4>
      <p>If you know, you know.</p>
      <h4>27. Scousers are fiercely defensive of the city</h4>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Why wouldn't we be? It is the best city in the world but loads of people don't get that.</p>
      <h4>28. And you'll come to understand why</h4>
      <p>Liverpool is known as the friendliest city for a reason.</p>
      <h4>29. Your life will never be boring married to a scouser</h4>
      <p>Absolutely never.</p>
      <h4>30. Scouse lads practically have an NVQ level 3 at applying fake tan on your back</h4>
      <figure>

      <p>Every Scouse lad knows about the Friday night struggle.</p>
      <h4>31. And, also one for picking the best aftershaves (they always smell fit)</h4>
      <p>Creed, Chanel Blu etc.</p>
      <h4>32. You''ll learn everyone in Liverpool knows everyone</h4>
      <p>This is ridiculously true. Everyone is connected.</p>
      <h4>33. Scousers will always go over the top when it comes to an occasion</h4>
      <p>First birthdays, Christmas, Mother's Day give Scousers an occasion and it will be celebrated</p>
      <h4>34. And, absolutely no expense is spared when it comes to the kids</h4>
      <p>One-year-olds in £100 tops? Yep.</p>
