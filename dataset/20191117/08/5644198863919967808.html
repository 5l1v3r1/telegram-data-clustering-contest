      <p>PRAGUE: Around a quarter-million Czechs flooded central Prague on Saturday (Nov 16) to mark 30 years since the Velvet Revolution toppled communism in then-Czechoslovakia, with protesters demanding that billionaire Prime Minister Andrej Babis quit over allegations of graft.</p>
      <p>Some demonstrators waved flags or brandished banners calling for Babis to step down and chanted "Shame!" and "Resign!".</p>

      <p>The CTK Czech news agency quoted Interior Minister Jan Hamacek as saying some 250,000 people had rallied at Letna park - the site of some of the biggest 1989 rallies - matching a similar protest in June.</p>
      <p>It came on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, which saw unprecedented protests and a general strike end four decades of Soviet-imposed totalitarianism in the former Czechoslovakia.</p>
      <p>A former communist, the populist Babis faces a string of graft allegations and a conflict-of-interest probe by the European Commission centred on Agrofert, his sprawling farming, media and chemicals holding.</p>
      <p>Babis has denied any wrongdoing and his ANO (YES) party still tops opinion polls with around 30 percent support despite the controversy.</p>
      <p>He is also tagged as an agent in secret police files from the 1980s, something he has vociferously denied.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'DEMOCRACY IN DANGER'?</b>
      </p>
      <p>People living in a house overlooking the rally strung a banner saying "Truth and love must prevail over lies and hatred", the motto of former Czech President Vaclav Havel, a former anti-communist dissident playwright.</p>
      <p>Kristyna Kovarova, a 20-year-old student from the southern village of Malenice, said she had come "to fight for democracy."</p>
      <p>"I think democracy is in danger because there are many people trying to twist it and set their own rules, but that's not right," she told AFP.</p>
      <p>"I really don't like our prime minister's lies," said protester Josef Plandor, who travelled from the eastern village of Zasova.</p>
      <p>"His huge conflict of interest, his lies, fraud, there's too much of that. He's not an honest man," said the 43-year-old forestry worker, adding that he was "sure" Babis would never quit.</p>
      <p>The Million Moments for Democracy movement, which organised the protest, called on Babis to either resolve his conflict of interest or step down.</p>
      <p>The 65-year-old Slovak-born politician was charged last year in connection with a €2 million (US$2.25 million) EU subsidy scam, but in September a Prague prosecutor cleared him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>STUDENT STRIKE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Babis, the fifth wealthiest Czech according to Forbes, leads the centrist populist ANO movement in a minority coalition government with the left-wing Social Democrats, propped up by the Communist Party in parliament.</p>
      <p>ANO took office after winning the 2017 general election campaigning on an anti-corruption ticket in the EU and NATO country of 10.6 million plagued by graft.</p>
      <p>On Nov 17, 1989, Communist police brutally crushed a students' march, sparking a student strike and the creation of an opposition movement which then negotiated the Communist Party's departure from politics.</p>
      <p>In late December 1989, Havel, then the opposition leader, was elected president of Czechoslovakia, which went on to peacefully split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993.</p>
      <p>The neighbours joined NATO and the EU, with Bratislava also joining the eurozone in 2009.</p>
