      <p>Mark Owen's squeaky clean image came undone when he admitted to being unfaithful to his wife Emma Ferguson in 2012.</p>
      <p>The Take That star, 47, and his wife, 44, who he wed in 2009 and shares two children with, decided to stay together and this week have celebrated their tenth wedding anniversary.</p>
      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to gush over his other-half, the Shine hitmaker posted an unusual snap of two sketched figures holding hands alongside a sweet caption.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "To my To my beautiful Emma....Made with love ️thank you for all that you are everyday, thank you for sharing this journey with me.......you are amazing!!!!!"</p>
      <p>Mark's tribute to Emma, who stood by his side despite his numerous infidelities, suggests the couple are stronger than ever but this was not always the case.</p>

      <p>In 2012 - three years after tying the knot to the gorgeous red-head and eight years since they began dating - Mark told he was "deeply-sorry" for his string of hook-ups and affairs - which he blamed on booze.</p>
      <p>Owen, who won <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity</a> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> in 2002, said he had seen a number of women over the years during his relationship.</p>
      <p>One of the affairs, with accounts manager Neva Hanley, went on for more than four years and Owen revealed they spent their final night together in a London hotel only a month before his marriage.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Owen apologised and asked to be left alone to work through his problems.</p>

      <p>He said: "I'm so deeply sorry for the pain my actions have caused my family and friends.</p>
      <p>Owen admitted he had been "an idiot" and said: "It's about me, my mistakes. Nobody else is to blame."</p>
      <p>Mark said most of his flings had been one-night stands and he estimated he had cheated with 10 women.</p>
      <p>The rest of the group are said to have known nothing about his long-term fling with Ms Hanley, whom he met at Preston railway station.</p>

      <p>He said he sent her cheques totalling £12,000 in the past year to help her financially.</p>
      <p>The star said he had been living with the guilt for years and that he wished he had confessed all before tying the knot.</p>
      <p>Owen said the one-off flings were due to his drinking, but he has now stopped and has been faithful since he and Emma were married.</p>
      <p>"On many levels it was a fresh start and that was how I was looking at it," he said in the interview.</p>
      <p>He broke the news of his infidelity to his wife at their London home the day prior to making his confessions public.</p>
      <p>He said owning up would help them to move on, and he wanted to be with his wife "for life".</p>
      <p>"It's going to do good in the long run. It's for the best, this," he said.</p>
      <p>Emma did not rush to stand by her man at first.</p>

      <p>Shortly after Mark spok out, Emma told a close friend: “I don’t know what to do. I need at least a week to think about what I want to do. I don’t know the man I’ve married – this isn’t him.”</p>
      <p>The friend told the Sunday Mirror: “Emma is absolutely mortified and as things stand she doesn’t think she can take Mark back. The sheer scale of the betrayal is so huge.</p>
      <p>“Almost overnight, Emma has gone from being in what she thought was a happy marriage to finding out her husband is a serial adulterer with a big drink ­problem.”</p>
      <p>Friends say that Emma is fighting hard to put on a brave face for the sake of the ­children – but her worst fear is reading any tawdry “kiss’n’tell” stories on Mark.</p>

      <p>Her friend added: “She’s scared of girls coming out of the woodwork and selling their story about liaisons with him.”</p>
      <p>Emma, who has appeared in The Bill and Sky One drama Mile High, kicked Mark out of their £2million home in Wandsworth, south-west London before the couple reconciled.</p>
      <p>A year after the revelations first came to light Mark discussed his marriage with Q magazine as he shared: “I do want us to grow old together. I do fancy her. Those feeling are there.”</p>
      <p>In 2013 Mark opened up on being "grateful" and "relieved" that he and Emma managed to patch things up in an interview with Notebook magazine.</p>
      <p>Mark said: “I feel relieved every day. To be able to be around my family and around Emma, I’m really massively grateful.</p>
      <p>"She’s been very patient and I can never thank her enough. I love my family with all of my heart.”</p>
