        <b>According to reports, Premier League giants Manchester United have assembled a transfer shortlist consisting of eight long-term, key targets ahead of the upcoming January transfer window.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-utd-draw-up-shortlist-20898847"><i>Mirror</i></a> claims that Manchester United’s attack is the focal point of manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s attention, as an overwhelming majority of his eight-man shortlist are attackers.</p>
      <p>It is no secret that the Red Devils are keen to sign Jadon Sancho and Erling Braut Haaland, from Borussia Dortmund and RB Salzburg respectively.</p>
      <p>Sancho has reportedly informed Dortmund that the ongoing 2019-20 season will be his final year in Germany, ahead of a potential return to England, his home country.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are also interested in the former Manchester City player, which is why Solskjaer has planned a bid for Haaland as an alternative.</p>
      <p>Apart from Sancho and Haaland, Manchester United are considering offers for other attackers like Moussa Dembele of Olympique Lyonnais, Callum Wilson of AFC Bournemouth and Jack Grealish of Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>Three midfielders – namely, Declan Rice of West Ham United, James Maddison of Leicester City and John McGinn of Aston Villa – complete Solskjaer’s wishlist.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Mirror</i>, all eight players are together expected to cost Manchester United a massive transfer fee of £415million, based on their current valuations.</p>
