        <b>Furious Janet Jackson fans reportedly stormed out of her concert in Perth over the weekend after she allegedly ‘lip-synced’ her way through the show.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Rhythm Nation singer headlined the RNB Fridays Live concert in Brisbane on Friday, which also saw the likes of Jason Derulo and Black Eyed Peas.</p>
      <p>But it was Janet’s show which garnered the most criticism with video footage showing groups of concert-goers leaving during her set.</p>
      <p>According <a href="https://www.couriermail.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=CMWEB_WRE170_a_GGL&amp;dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.couriermail.com.au%2Fentertainment%2Fconfidential%2Fcrowd-exodus-during-janet-jacksons-rnb-fridays-live-performance%2Fnews-story%2Fd20968079235ee424d0d3370845c6da0&amp;memtype=anonymous&amp;mode=premium&amp;v21suffix=47-b">to the Courier Mail,</a> fans described the performance as a ‘disaster’ with Janet allegedly miming along to her iconic hits.</p>
      <p>One concert-goer told the publication: ‘When Janet Jackson came on it was just a disaster.</p>
      <p>‘Her sound was just terrible. She would be singing and then all of a sudden just do random stuff.’</p>
      <p>Another disappointed concert-goer added: ‘I’ve never seen so many people walk out of a concert before.’</p>

      <p>A woman who attended the RNB Friday concert tweeted her experience of the show, revealing: ‘My night at the concert consisted of a proposal during jason derulo, a girl flashing her tits to the camera in 50 cent, a cat fight breaking out and a weave flying in the air during black eyed peas and janet jackson lip syncing.’</p>

      <p>Another criticised: ‘Sorry Janet I have been a lifelong fan but backing tracks and a lip synced show was pretty poor. If you can’t dance and sing live anymore maybe cut back the dancing and sing LIVE that’s what people are paying for a LIVE show.’</p>
      <p>And another music fan weighed in: ‘Very sad that ‘lip syncing’ is taken for granted at a ‘live ‘show. WTF happened to our musical world. The motto for all live performers should be “Tell the truth out there on stage”.’</p>
      <p>One fan wondered: ‘Why do they bother, she’s known for lip syncing and these concert goers paid the price.’</p>
      <p>However, not everyone was disappointed with Janet’s performance as another said: ‘It’s like I died and went to Jackson heaven with this song… she blew the roof off! I’m gonna be sore for days from dancing.’</p>
      <p>Defending the popstar, one added: ‘I LOVE Janet, like LOOOVVVE But, y’all thought she was actually SINGING at shows all these years?? Have you heard a song? Like, REALLY listened to her music?? Because…I mean… [sic].’</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/29/janet-jackson-leaves-fans-disappointed-hyped-glastonbury-festival-performance-10091181/">Janet was also criticised for her performance at Glastonbury</a> festival over her vocals which some complained they struggled to hear.</p>
