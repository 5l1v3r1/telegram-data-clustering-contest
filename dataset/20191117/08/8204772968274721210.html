      <p>Gardaí believe a teenager who died Sunday after being struck by a vehicle in Co <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Limerick">Limerick</a> was walking home from a house party.</p>
      <p>The incident involving the 16-year-old, named locally as Nathan Lawlor Hough from Rathkeale, happened at around 3.45am on the N21 Limerick to Tralee road.</p>
      <p>It is understood that Nathan, a fifth year secondary school student, had earlier attended a birthday in a local pub before going to the house party.</p>
      <p>“He would have been well known around the town, and there wouldn’t have been a bad word to say about him,”a local source said.</p>
      <p>They said the boy’s friends “can’t get their heads around it and are in total shock”.</p>
      <p>When gardaí arrived at the scene of the collision an ambulance crew was already working on the boy but he was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>A postmortem is due to be carried out on the teenager at University Hospital Limerick on Monday.</p>
      <p>The male driver of the car involved was not injured and was helping gardaí with their enquiries, a garda source said.</p>
      <p>A garda spokeswoman said: “Anyone with information is asked to contact <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Newcastle+West">Newcastle West</a> Garda Station on 069 - 20650, the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111 or any Garda Station.”</p>
