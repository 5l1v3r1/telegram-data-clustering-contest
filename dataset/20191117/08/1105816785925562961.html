      <h1>Bella Hadid says she never felt powerful modelling for Victoria's Secret</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:26:33+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>American-Palestinian model Bella Hadid just dropped a bombshell confession about modeling for lingerie brand Victoria’a Secret</p>
      <p>Despite walking the luxury brand’s fashion show for three consecutive years, Haid reveals it wasn’t until Rihanna’s Fenty show during New York Fashion Week that she was comfortable with dropping down to her undergarments in front of an audience, reported <i><a href="https://www.instyle.com/news/bella-hadid-never-felt-powerful-victorias-secret">InStyle.</a></i></p>
      <p>Gigi’s younger sister spoke at the <i>Vogue</i> Fashion Festival in Paris on Friday, and without explicitly naming names, she said her experience at Fenty was more empowering than her participation in “other lingerie shows.”</p>

      <p>“Rihanna’s amazing,” she told Loïc Prigent at the event. “For me, that was the first time on a runway that I felt really sexy. Because when I first did Fenty, I was doing other lingerie shows and I never felt powerful on a runway, like, in my underwear.”</p>

      <p>According to Hadid, this was due to the superstar singer allowing her to walk the runway anyway she wanted, which alleviated the pressure too act a certain way.</p>
      <p>“I like being another character. I think at this point I don’t necessarily love being myself sometimes,” she shared. “Sometimes on the runway you get either nervous or you forget how your legs move.”</p>

      <p>After numerous complaints about its lack of diversity, Victoria’s Secret won’t be hosting its annual extravaganza this year. In May, it was reported that the show would no longer be broadcast on network television because of declining viewership, and, two months later, Victoria’s Secret Angel Shanina Shaik confirmed that it was canceled all together.</p>
      <p>However, she doesn’t believe that’s a permanent decision. “I’m sure in the future something will happen,” she told <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>. “They’re trying to work on branding and new ways to do the show because it’s the best show in the world.”</p>
