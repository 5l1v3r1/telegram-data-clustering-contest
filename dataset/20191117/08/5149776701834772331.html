      <p>Nottingham Forest have revealed a fresh image of the proposed City Ground redevelopment as the club continue to progress with their plans.</p>
      <p>Excitement is really building for the transformation of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">the Reds’</a> home into a world-class stadium which will see the Peter Taylor Stand rebuilt to cater for an increased capacity of about 10,000 fans.</p>
      <p>The plans were unveiled earlier this year, and the club have provided a new glimpse of what to expect.</p>
      <p>It is <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-plans-3386066">anticipated planning application</a> for the project will be submitted before the end of this year, and should permission be granted, it is hoped work could get underway during the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>Tom Cartledge, lead architect and CEO of Benoy - the architecture firm behind the multi-million pound project - says a lot of work has been going on behind the scenes since the initial announcement in March.</p>
      <p>“Personally it’s been incredibly frustrating because I’ve not been able to tell many people,” joked Cartledge, a Reds fan.</p>

      <p>“I have been surrounded by Forest fans in the stand, and at home and in the pub! They’ve been desperate to know!</p>
      <p>“On a project like this there’s a huge amount of things that you have to bring together.</p>
      <p>“We’ve done a lot of consultation work, both within the club - working with the players and the management to understand what world-class facilities look like for them <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/match-reports/nottinham-forest-derby-county-analysis-3521884">on matchdays</a>, in terms of changing rooms and other facilities.</p>
      <p>“But then also working with the corporate team here to really understand what the opportunities are for a diverse mix of premium seating.</p>
      <p>“And then you’re also really looking at the stadium and the stand itself, in terms of its design and how it’s in keeping with the other stands and respecting the local community and the neighbourhood - as well as the challenges around integrating what is a large building into an urban area.</p>
      <p>“There has been a huge amount of work and the work doesn’t stop now.”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/evangelos-marinakis-confirms-nottingham-forest-2592300">redevelopment of the City Ground</a> will involve around £100m of investment and as well as additional seating in the Peter Taylor Stand, new state of the art dressing rooms, a museum, club shop, executive boxes and media suites will also be included.</p>
      <p>Improvements will also be made to the other three sides of the ground, with the Bridgford Stand also extended.</p>
