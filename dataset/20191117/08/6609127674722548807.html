      <p>The Sun Online has seen the result but has chosen not to reveal it, but fans who saw the news on Twitter were left outraged.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "Omg actually very shocked in that result #StrictlySpoiler #Strictly."</p>
      <p>Another raged: "strictly’s voting system is acc the biggest pile of s*** ive ever seen like #StrictlySpoiler."</p>

      <p>A third was equally furious, tweeting: "the #StrictlySpoiler this evening is the final straw. this series is an absolute f***ing fix and I refuse to watch any more episodes.</p>
      <p>"I used to enjoy Strictly so much but decent people have gone out and this is taking it way too far. f*** this I'm going to bed."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile a fourth wrote: "honestly feel more let down by the british public about this than brexit #strictlyspoiler."</p>
      <p>Another viewer demanded the BBC start airing the results show on a Saturday to avoid the spoiler situation.</p>

      <p>They tweeted: "BBC it’s time you start showing the results on a Saturday night at 9pm. We all know it’s filmed straight after the show. #StrictlySpoiler @BBC."</p>
      <p>The Blackpool spectacular saw Kelvin Fletcher and Karim Zeroual share the top spot on the leaderboard with 39 points for the Jive and Charleston, respectively.</p>
      <p>However, viewers were furious that neither star received a perfect score from the judges, after Craig Revel Horwood kept his 10 paddle locked away all evening.</p>
