      <h1>Sam Cosgrove 'targeted' by Stoke as Michael O'Neill weighs up January move for Aberdeen star</h1>
      <h2>The Potters have reportedly been watching the striker all season and Michael O'Neill is a big admirer.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:54:50+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:54</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Stoke City are reportedly weighing up a January move for Aberdeen striker <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sam-cosgrove">Sam Cosgrove</a> .</p>
      <p>The Dons talisman has scored 16 goals in 20 games for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/derek-mcinnes">Derek McInnes</a> ' side this season and that impressive return has attracted interest from down south.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4962439/stoke-city-transfer-aberdeen-sam-cosgrove/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1573943787">Scottish Sun</a> claim the Potters have been 'watching' the striker all season and new boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/michael-oneill">Michael O'Neill</a> is a big admirer.</p>
      <p>O'Neill will get the opportunity to bring in some new recruits in the New Year after recently joining the English side.</p>
      <p>One of the more bizarre transfer stories of the summer was Cosgrove being linked with Celtic's Euro rivals Lazio.</p>

      <p>But the Englishman dismissed those rumours, saying: "I heard about it but I think it was a load of rubbish to be honest.</p>
      <p>"Two years ago you could have asked me and I’d have said playing for any professional club and I’d be happy.</p>
      <p>"I always believed in myself as a footballer, but I couldn’t have wished it to go any better so far."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> boss McInnes is expecting bids to land for the in-form striker, but insisted at the start of the season he wouldn't be going anywhere in the January window.</p>
      <p>He said: "We’ve had enquiries about Sam already from other clubs but he will be staying with us this season.</p>
      <p>“He’s improved so much in a short period of time and hopefully there’s more to come from Sam."</p>
