        <b>It was a tough day for <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/carlos-sainz">Carlos Sainz</a> after he failed to set a time during qualifying for the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/Brazilian-grand-prix">Brazilian Grand Prix</a>. The Spaniard admitted it is going to be a mighty challenge if he is to reach the points during the race.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sainz was looking to extend McLaren's and his own lead in the battle for best of the rest but he'll now face a battle to achieve any points at all after exiting Q1 without setting a lap. The day got off to a good start for Sainz who finished in the top ten during FP3 and looked to be leading the midfield once again. </p>
      <p>However, an engine issue looks to have given him little hope of a positive result but he vowed to do his best.</p>

      <p><i>“Big disappointment today. An issue with the engine during my first attempt in Q1 meant I couldn’t even set a lap-time,"</i> Sainz told the <a href="https://www.mclaren.com/racing/2019/brazilian-grand-prix/2019-brazilian-grand-prix-qualifying/">McLaren website</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"We’ll investigate what happened, but I’m obviously disappointed because it cost us a good shot at Q3 today.</i>
