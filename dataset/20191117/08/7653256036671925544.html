      <p>New Delhi: State-owned firms should be subjected to governance standards on par with private players to ensure a level-playing field as "excessive scrutiny" by the CVC, CAG and the threat of a CBI probe often leads to stalled or over-cautious decision-making in PSUs, according to industry body CII.</p>
      <p>The suggestion is part of the Competitiveness Model developed by CII Research comprising six key elements to enable central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) to compete successfully in the global marketplace.</p>
      <p>"CPSEs must be subject to the same governance standards as private players. Excessive scrutiny from the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Central-Vigilance-Commission">Central Vigilance Commission</a> (CVC) and the Comptroller Auditor General (CAG), coupled with the threat of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) often leads to stalled or over-cautious decision-making in CPSEs. Further, distinction must be made between mala-fide action and taking a business risk," the chamber said.</p>
      <p>The model also calls for clarity on the road-map for CPSEs, highlighting that given the current environment of divestment uncertainty, it is critical to appraise their top management in advance about a decision in this regard.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/India">India</a>'s public sector enterprises can become globally competitive," said <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Chandrajit-Banerjee">Chandrajit Banerjee</a>, Director-General, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), referring to its research report 'The Rise of the Elephant: Enhancing Competitiveness of Central Public Sector Enterprises' due for formal release on Monday.</p>
      <p>One of the elements in the report relates to clear role demarcation, noting that a well-documented policy defining and separating the roles of the owner (government), management and board is essential in order to help avoid passive ownership or excessive interference.</p>
      <p>The report highlights that there are examples internationally and a few in India to demonstrate that efficient operations and fulfilment of social obligations are not contradictory.</p>
      <p>Related to this are the elements of operational independence and instituting an independent and empowered board. Operational independence comprises independence in operational decision-making and in personnel related matters such as recruitment, promotion, compensation and other terms of employment.</p>
      <p>"An independent and empowered board will transform CPSEs from being ministry-driven to Board-driven. The intent is that the board, comprising independent experts, would take all strategic decisions, thereby increasing the speed and efficacy of decision-making," the chamber said.</p>
      <p>The Competitiveness Model also entails the need for PSUs to become future-ready by developing internal competencies in technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Internet">Internet</a> of Things, blockchain, and big data analytics, amongst others.</p>
