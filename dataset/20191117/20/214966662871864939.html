      <p>A ferocious thunderstorm hit parts of the Gold Coast yesterday, smashing suburbs with strong winds, rain and copious amounts of hailstones, some the size of golf balls.</p>
      <p>The fierce and quick storm formed early in the South East on Sunday afternoon before hurtling towards the northern Gold Coast around 2.30pm.</p>
      <p>According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the super cells brought scattered rain falls of 10-20mm across the south east, with some isolated falls up to 39mm.</p>
      <p>Hail up to 6cm was also reported, with the monster hail stones leaving a trail of destruction.</p>
      <p>The suburbs that copped the worst of it were Helensvale, Labrador, Biggera Waters, Ashmore, Coomera and Pimpma.</p>
      <p>A motorist was event treated by paramedics after lightning struck a car on Patonga Street in Ashmore around 3.20pm.</p>
      <p>Thankfully they were uninjured and didn’t need to be taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>Further north and Energex crews were kept busy with mass blackouts from Logan up to the Sunshine Coast.</p>
      <p>“Crews working to restore power to 16,000 SEQ customers after severe storms. 78,000 lightning strikes &amp; 37 lines down,” Energex wrote.</p>
