      <p>Residents in the vicinity of three fires have been told to “leave now” as 75 bushfires continue to burn across the state. STAY UP TO DATE WITH THE LATEST ALERTS AND WARNINGS HERE</p>
      <p>The most significant bushfires are burning at Pechey, Mt Lindesay, Moreton Island and Lowmead south of Gladstone.</p>
      <p>Despite fire conditions easing slighting across the state today, a Queensland Fire and Emergency Services spokeswoman said fireys are “holding on” while they wait for significant rainfall.</p>
      <p>Smoke haze from nearby fires continues to impact air quality across the southeast, with ‘very poor’ air quality ratings in Cannon Hill, Rocklea, South Brisbane, Southport, Springwood and Woolloongabba.</p>
      <p>Residents in parts of Queensland’s Scenic Rim have been forced from their homes as a large, “unpredictable” bushfire approaches under worsening conditions.</p>
      <p>The Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) warned Tarome residents late on Sunday that a “large, unpredictable” fire west of the town was travelling eastward and could have a significant impact on the community. “Conditions are getting worse,” the QFES said.</p>
      <p>People living close to or on Ryan Road, Hinrichsen Road, Simmonds Road, Campsite Road and McGuire Road were at risk and were advised to leave and seek shelter at the Kalbar School of Arts Hall in Kalbar.</p>

      <p>Firefighters are hoping cooler conditions may give them a break on Monday as they battle 75 bushfires across the state, but severe weather appears set to return midweek.</p>
      <p>The most challenging blazes are at Ravensbourne and Esk, near Toowoomba, and the fire at Tarome, where residents were told to evacuate.</p>
      <p>Campers were also evacuated late on Sunday from the path of a dangerous fire on Moreton Island, off Brisbane, ahead of an expected wind change.</p>

      <p>The threat of a bushfires burning in the Somerset Region has seen a local hospital choose to “self-evacuate”.</p>
      <p>The Esk Hospital yesterday afternoon made the decision to evacuate patients as a bushfire on Esk Hampton Rd travelled in the direction of the hospital, which is about 20km away from the fire.</p>
      <p>It’s understood a total of six patients have been evacuated.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman from the Queensland Police Service has reminded locals to listen to official messaging from police and Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES), saying the decision to evacuate was one made by the hospital.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile a dangerous bushfire on Moreton Island is expected to hit campsites, authorities say.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Queensland Fire and Emergency Services issued an alert on Sunday afternoon urging all campers to evacuate the island now.</p>
      <p>As at 6.20am, slow-moving, dangerous fire is burning close to the southern and eastern side of the township of Bulwer.</p>
      <p>“There is also potential for this fire to move unpredictably. It is expected to impact campsites right across Moreton Island in the coming hours and days.</p>
      <p>“The fire could have a significant impact on campers.”</p>
      <p>Tangalooma Island Resort has opened its doors to campers who need somewhere to stay.</p>
      <p>People camping on the eastern side of the island should travel on Southern Middle Rd or Bulwer-Blue Lagoon Rd towards the western side of the island before progressing south along the beach to Tangalooma.</p>

      <p>Campers on the western side of the island should travel south along the beach, directly to Tangalooma.</p>
      <p>Weakening winds on Monday should see fire conditions ease from severe to very high, the Bureau of Meteorology says.</p>
      <p>“It’s still elevated but it’s obviously a big improvement from the extremes of (Sunday),” meteorologist Jess Gardner said.</p>
      <p>“The wind direction is switching from a westerly, where it brings hot dry air, to an easterly, where it’s cooler and more humid.”</p>
      <p>Temperatures will also fall, however, the fire danger looks set to remain at very high for most of the week.</p>
      <p>It could become severe on the Darling Downs on Wednesday, with Toowoomba forecast to reach 35C.</p>
