      <p>The U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan John Bass reacted to Afghan government’s decision to reassess the release of 3 senior Haqqani Network leaders in exchange for the release of kidnapped American University lecturers.</p>
      <p>“We supported President Ghani’s announcement to release three #Taliban prisoners to promote #peace – and the decision to reassess their pending transfer following the attacks in #Logar and #Kabul on November 12 and 13,” Ambassador Bass said in a Twitter post earlier today.</p>
      <p>Ambassador further added “Making #peace means making hard choices, but it also requires careful review of the conditions on the ground. As strategic partners, we will continue to work closely with the #Afghan government on next steps.”</p>
      <p>The Afghan government had earlier announced that it has reversed the decision to swap the three Haqqani network leaders with the American University lecturers.</p>
      <p>Presidential spokesperson Sediq Sediqqi said late on Saturday that Anas Haqqani, Mali Khan and Hafiz Rashid, the three senior Haqqani network leaders are still in the custody of the Afghan government.</p>
      <p>Sediqqi blamed the postponement of the prisoners swap, claiming that the group failed to respect the conditions of the process.</p>
      <p>He also added that the Afghan government has reconsidered decision and will take further actions in the light of the interests and benefits of Afghanistan.</p>
