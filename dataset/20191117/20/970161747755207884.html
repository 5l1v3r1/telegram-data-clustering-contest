        <b>Gerwyn Price turned in a sensational display in the final of the Grand Slam of Darts, hammering Peter Wright 16-6 to defend his title in spectacular fashion.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Iceman was in stunning form in Wolverhampton, as he averaged 107.86, hitting 11 180s and checking out at 48%.</p>
      <p>The Welshman beat Michael van Gerwen in the semi-finals and followed up that superb win with an even better performance against an incredulous Snakebite.</p>
      <p>Price made his intentions clear from the very start of the game when he checked out 100 in a 12-darter against the throw in the opening leg.</p>
      <p>This set the tone for a match in which he was never behind and dominated throughout, claiming the £125,000 top prize in some style.</p>
      <p>Wright hardly played badly, finishing with an average of 96.66, but he was hanging onto Price’s coattails in the first half of the contest, before being left for dust as the game reached its conclusion.</p>

      <p>The resounding victory for Price also saw him become only the seventh player to retain a major title in PDC history after Phil Taylor, Michael van Gerwen, Raymond van Barneveld, Rod Harrington, Adrian Lewis and Gary Anderson.</p>
      <p>It was performance of such quality from the new world number three that he will now be seen as a legitimate contender for the World Championship which gets underway next month.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old has never been past the third round at the Alexandra Palace but will now be expected to go a long way this time round.</p>
      <p>‘I knew in the middle of that game that I was playing really well, hitting trebles for fun and putting Peter under pressure,’ said Price.</p>
      <p>‘He wasn’t playing his best but I knew that I was at the top of my game, I’m chuffed to bits to get hold of this again and finally get the crowd to cheer.</p>
      <p>‘This week they’ve been fantastic and I’m not used to this. They truly have got behind me this weekend and I appreciate it, they pushed me on to win this.’</p>
      <p>Price will go to number three in the world with this win, and he thinks he is even better than that: ‘I think i’m number one,’ he said. ‘I’ve had a good year, a good 18 months.’</p>

      <p>Wright was gracious in defeat and could only accept that his opponent was near-unbeatable.</p>
      <p>‘I was just chasing him all the way through and when he missed I was on 100-and-something, if I was lucky. He played fantastic all the way through,’ said Snakebite.</p>
      <p>‘I had no answer, but I switched to these darts and said to myself “I think I can get to the final” and I did.’</p>
