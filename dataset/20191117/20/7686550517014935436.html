      <h1>Welsh darts star Gerwyn Price just won £125,000 and is officially the third best player on the planet</h1>
      <h2>The former Welsh rugby player has reached a new high in his career</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:50:25+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:50</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Mitchelmore</a></address>
      <p>Gerwyn Price successfully defended his Grand Slam of Darts title with an emphatic 16-6 win over Peter Wright in the 2019 final.</p>
      <p>The Welshman produced a scintillating display against Snakebite, ending the game with an average of 107.86, the second highest ever average recorded in a final of the competition.</p>
      <p>He scooped £125,000 as a result of winning the event at Aldersley Leisure Village in Wolverhampton, a sum that sees him move up to a best ever position of third in the world rankings.</p>
      <p>It represents what was a stunning title defence for the former rugby player who was <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/gerwyn-price-gary-anderson-investigation-15442474">booed by fans during his controversial win against Gary Anderson</a> in the final of the same tournament last year.</p>
      <p>Price defeated Anderson in 2018 to become the first ever Welshman to win a PDC major, although <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/darts-player-gerwyn-price-fined-15721460">he was hit with a hefty fine</a> by the Darts Regulation Authority after the two players collided during the contest.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/former-welsh-rugby-player-bombarded-15433307">He was later subjected to vile abuse on social media</a> but did have the fine significantly reduced after appealing the decision.</p>
      <p>However, after being on the receiving end of such a hostile reception at several events since that triumph, Price won the hearts of the crowd this time around, with fans regularly chanting his name as he won the tournament for the second year running.</p>

      <p>Speaking after his sensational win over Wright, the ex-Cross Keys, Neath and Glasgow Warriors rugby player said: "I knew in the middle of that game that I was playing really well.</p>
      <p>"I was hitting trebles for fun and I was putting Peter under pressure. He wasn't playing his best but I knew I was at the top of my game.</p>
      <p>"I felt comfortable all the way through that game.</p>
      <p>"I'm chuffed to bits to get this again and finally have the crowd cheering me.</p>
      <p>"They (fans) truly have got behind me this week and they pushed me to win this.</p>
      <p>"I've had a good 18 months. I'm just thankful to win this again."</p>

      <p>Price won all seven of his matches in the competition.</p>
      <p>He qualified for the knockout stages by securing victories against Mikuru Suzuki, Robert Thornton and Dimitri Van den Bergh, with his 100% record seeing him finish at the top of his group.</p>
      <p>Price demolished Darren Webster 10-1 in the last-32 before beating nemesis Anderson 16-9 in the quarter-finals.</p>

      <p>He created more history in the last four as he secured a 16-12 triumph against Michael van Gerwen, his first ever win against the current world number one.</p>
      <p>And his success over Scotsman Wright saw him become only the third player in history to defend the Grand Slam title.</p>
