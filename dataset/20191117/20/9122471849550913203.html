      <h1>The Betting Line For Arkansas-LSU Is Historic</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:24:01+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>There have been some pretty massive spreads on college football games this year. Few have been as big as the line for Ohio State at Rutgers this past week. But the betting line for the Arkansas-LSU game could go down as one of the most incredible in SEC history.</p>
      <p>According to Circa Sports via David Purdum, the Tigers have opened as an incredible 46-point favorite over the Razorbacks at Tigers Stadium. Purdum noted that the 46-point betting line is the largest spread between two SEC teams since 1978.</p>
      <p>It’s little surprise that the spread is so massive. Arkansas has given up at least 45 points in four straight games. They’ve been outscored 198-60 in the process, and even fired head coach Chad Morris.</p>
      <p>The fact that Arkansas allowed 45 points to middling Western Kentucky in their last game could indicate a blowout looming.</p>

      <p>If nothing else, the game will be a chance for LSU quarterback Joe Burrow to pad his stats as he continues making his Heisman Trophy push.</p>
      <p>But if the Tigers can’t win this game by upwards of five touchdowns, that might feel just as bad as a loss to some fans.</p>
      <p>Will LSU cover the 46-point spread against Arkansas in Week 13?</p>
