      <p>TORONTO — City officials say an emergency shelter for hundreds of people who were displaced after an apartment fire in Toronto has been moved to a nearby university.</p>
      <p>They say York University offered to house the residents and the Canadian Red Cross will provide meals, cots, blankets, showers, personal hygiene items and pet care.</p>
      <p>Roughly 700 residents were evacuated and one person died when a fire erupted in a 15 storey apartment building in the city's north end.</p>
      <p>The city says authorities, engineers and restoration experts are working to re-open the building as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>About 165 residents have signed in with the Canadian Red Cross and 100 residents have stayed at the aid organization's shelter since the blaze.</p>
      <p>The Canadian Red Cross is urging everyone affected by the fire to register with them to stay updated and so they can help residents access support services.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 17, 2019.</p>
