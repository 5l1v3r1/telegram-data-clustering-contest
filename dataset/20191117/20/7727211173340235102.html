      <p>Strictly Come Dancing viewers were left angry after tonight's results show saw fan favourite Michelle Visage leave the show.</p>
      <p>Last night the 51-year-old preformed a highly stylised version of Madonna's Vogue, but while it impressed the judges, Michelle and her professional partner Giovanni Pernice found themselves at the bottom of the leader board with 32 points.</p>
      <p>Stand out dances from the other six couples made for tough competition and after combining her score with the public vote she had to battle it out in the dreaded dance-off against <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/youtube">YouTube</a> star Saffron Barker and her partner AJ Pritchard.</p>

      <p>The judges were unanimous in their decision to save Saffron, but admitted they were torn by the choice of parings.</p>
      <p>Craig Revel Horwood said: "I'm having a really difficult time with myself over this. This doesn't normally happen to me. I normally make a very quick, instant decision. This has been really, really difficult."</p>

      <p>Michelle, a judge on RuPaul's Drag Race UK, said: "This whole experience has been amazing.</p>
      <p>"At 51 years old and never danced in my life, I never thought I'd be able to do what I have done and to have such an incredible partner.</p>
      <p>"To be here for my husband and my kids and the entire community, that's why I did what I did.</p>
      <p>"I am so honoured to be welcomed by my new friends here."</p>
      <p>Pernice admitted that the couple had been through a range of emotions during their time together, but said he has respect for his partner despite their arguments.</p>
      <p>He said: "We laugh, we cry, we fight and we argue and we've done everything but I've loved every single second. I think you are inspirational."</p>
      <p>Fans at home were devastated to see her go, many venting their frustration on Twitter, one @beckhughesxo said: "Can’t believe they saved Saffron over Michelle."</p>
      <p>Another, @WestCountrySuzi said: "Awwwww.....that's a real shame...thought she'd make it to the final."</p>
      <p>A third, @IshMotherBec said: "Another slightly shock exit. Although it's at the stage when almost any exit feels wrong."</p>
      <p>A fourth, @AaronLR1991 said: "I’m so annoyed!"</p>
      <p>And a fifth @evilcheltdevil added: "Gutted for @michellevisage and @pernicegiovann1 - just the worst result."</p>
      <p>Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse, as well as Amy Dowden and Karim Zeroual, dominated the Strictly live show and earned near-perfect scores.</p>
      <p>Chris Ramsey and Karen Hauer were spared the dance-off despite the judges leaving them second from bottom.</p>
      <p>The final decision was a difficult one for the judges, with the experts torn on who to send home.</p>
