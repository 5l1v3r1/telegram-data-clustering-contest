        <b>England’s 2019 vintage drew level with the World Cup winners from 1966 as Harry Kane was once again on target against Kosovo</b>
      </p>
      <p>Harry Kane and England wrapped up a prolific 2019 with a 4-0 Euro 2020 qualification win against Kosovo on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Next year, Gareth Southgate’s team will hope to emulate their country’s greatest ever side by winning a major tournament at Wembley.</p>
      <p>England’s current vintage are at least the equal of Alf Ramsey’s World Cup winners in one way already – their 38 goals scored in 2019 is the same number that the Three Lions managed in a seminal 1966.</p>
      <p>Only once, in 1909, have England managed more goals in a calendar year, when they scored 39 in just seven games.</p>

      <p>Kane’s individual haul of 12 equalled the record for an England player in a calendar year, standing alongside Everton great Dixie Dean’s efforts in 1927 and George Hilsdon in 1908.</p>
      <p>The Tottenham star has now netted in each of his past six international appearances and is the only England player to do so in the post-war era – matching his own efforts between October 2017 and July 2018.</p>
