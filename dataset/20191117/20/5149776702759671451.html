      <p>Police are investigating after windows were smashed at the headquarters of Labour's parliamentary candidate for Ashfield.</p>
      <p>Officers were called to Outram Street, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/">Sutton-in-Ashfield</a>, at 10.30am on Sunday (November 17) after reports of criminal damage.</p>
      <p>Windows of Natalie Fleet's headquarters were smashed.</p>
      <p>She tweeted to say it was 'hard' to deal with but that it "takes more than this to shut us Ashfield women up".</p>

      <p>Anyone with information that may help is asked to contact Nottinghamshire Police on 101, quoting incident 266 of November 17.</p>

      <p>The Labour party previously announced Ms Fleet as their candidate at the next <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/">general election</a>.</p>
      <p>It comes after the former MP Gloria De Pierro said she would not seek re-election, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/labour-names-general-election-candidate-3451535">citing a â€˜lack of tolerance in the party'</a>.</p>
