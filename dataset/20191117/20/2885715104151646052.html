      <h1>Lack of investor interest a challenge for Odisha’s plastic park project</h1>
      <h2>The thrust in the park model, say state government officials, was to develop common facilities that are otherwise not available in multi-product parks.</h2>

      <p>The Odisha government claims it will have the first fully operational plastic park in the country, but concedes that it is struggling to find investors to set up units inside the facility.</p>
      <p>According to people familiar with the details of the project, the problem is “lack of entrepreneur awareness” that is threatening to derail the state government’s assumption that non-financial incentives to boost manufacturing are probably more advantageous for potential investors than financial incentives like tax exemptions.</p>

        <b>EXPLAINED</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Big potential for plastics manufacturing</h3>
      <p>A note accessed from Odisha government states that India’s domestic production meets only 50 per cent of its demand for plastic, which is increasing with the construction and infrastructure industry. “Today, India consumes plastic to the tune of 12 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of which about 6 million tonnes is produced domestically and about four MTPA are imported”, the document states. To reduce imports, the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals (DCPC), Ministry of Chemicals &amp; Fertilizers (MoCF), had formulated a scheme for setting up of four Plastic Parks in Assam (Tinsukia), Madhya Pradesh (Raisen), Odisha (Jagatsinghpur) and Tamil Nadu (Thiruvallur).</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>However, the park has so far only allotted plots to nine units against a potential of 80 units that can manufacture woven sacks, plastic pipes, and injection moulded components, films, pouches and consumer plastic products, among others. The eight units account for only 30 per cent of leasable land.</p>
      <p>The thrust in this park model, say state government officials, was to develop common facilities that are otherwise not available in multi-product parks.</p>
      <p>“Operating inside such an ecosystem would take them 10 years ahead of a unit operating outside — time and resources do not need to be spent to set up water, power, road infrastructure, along with required clearances”, said Sanjay Singh, Chief Managing Director, Odisha Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (IIDCO) and Skill Development Authority.</p>
      <p>“We have developed an administrative block, testing lab, skill development centre, place for banks to operate, a clinic, supplied water and power, along with all statutory approvals like environmental clearance and consent to establish, workers’ dormitory, residential accommodation for senior officers, warehousing facilities”, he further said.</p>
      <p>“Raw material, like polypropylene and Mono Ethyle Glycol, would come from Indian Oil Corporation. We have an expert institutions like Central Institute for Plastics Engineering and Technology (CIPET) for training workforce and (tech) hand holding purposes. The customers are available in the vicinity,” Singh added.</p>
      <p>Explaining lack of “entrepreneur awareness”, another state government official dealing with the project said, “Enterpreneurs say that if they can get land outside the park for, say, Rs 30 lakh, then why should they pay a premium for land inside the park? However, considering price alone is not a fair comparison”.</p>
      <p>Principal Director at CIPET’s Bhubaneswar branch, P K Sahoo, told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> that investors are bargaining for financial incentives. “In a meeting on October 29 at Paradip, industry players said they were keen on credit limits from raw material supplier, lower power tariffs and tax relaxations along the lines of an SEZ”.</p>
      <p>Singh added that enterpreneurs may realise other non-financial incentives, such as buyers in the vicinity of the park. “For example, industrial units in the park will produce woven sacks, which are in demand by fertilizer companies around Paradip (port).”</p>
