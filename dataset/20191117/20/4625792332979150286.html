      <h1>'Dumb and unfair': Trump attacks 'nasty &amp; obnoxious' Chris Wallace after Scalise interview</h1>

      <p>President Trump attacked Fox News anchor Chris Wallace and defended Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, whom Wallace interviewed earlier Sunday.</p>
      <p>Scalise, 54, faced a contentious interview with Wallace, who repeatedly pushed back on his defense of the president regarding the House's impeachment investigation. In one particular moment of the interview, Wallace criticized the Louisiana congressman for labeling the government officials who are testifying as "<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/chris-wallace-hits-steve-scalise-for-dismissing-schiffs-witnesses">Schiff's witnesses</a>."</p>
      <p>".<a href="https://twitter.com/SteveScalise">@SteveScalise</a> blew the nasty &amp; obnoxious Chris Wallace (will never be his father, Mike!) away on Chris’s lowest rated (unless I’m on) morning show," Trump tweeted. "This kind of dumb and unfair interview would never have happened in the <a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNews">@FoxNews</a> past. Great job Steve!"</p>

      <p>The president has repeatedly brought up Wallace's father, former <i>60 Minutes</i> correspondent Mike Wallace, as a way to express his displeasure with the younger Wallace.</p>
      <p>“He often likes to say about me, ‘You know, I was covered by Mike Wallace, I liked him much more,’” the Fox News anchor said during an October meeting with <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hes-not-our-boss-fox-news-anchors-trash-trump-in-meeting-with-advertisers">advertisers</a>. “To which my reaction is always: 'One of us has a daddy problem, and it’s not me.'" Trump echoed that sentiment about Wallace in a tweet days before explaining that he "will never be his father."</p>
