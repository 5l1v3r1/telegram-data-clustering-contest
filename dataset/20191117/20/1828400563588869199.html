      <p>Michelle and Giovanni were ranked the lowest on the scoreboard and found themselves facing the prospect of another dance-off alongside Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard, after receiving the fewest votes from the public.</p>
      <p>After a nail biting dance-off in which both contestants upped their game the panel voted to save the social media star and send Michelle home.</p>
      <p>Michelle said she was proud to have taken a risk with their couple's choice dance to Madonna's Vogue and the mission statement behind it, which she had dedicated to the LGBT+ community.</p>
