      <h1>Over 30,000 march in Greek annual anti-junta demos</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:00:14+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">John HADOULIS (AFP)</a></address>
      <p>Over 30,000 Greeks demonstrated under a heavy police presence Sunday to mark the anniversary of a 1973 anti-junta uprising, the first since the election of the new conservative government.</p>
      <p>The protest, one of the largest and most uneventful in years, was heavily influenced by opposition to the four-month administration of Kyriakos Mitsotakis, elected in July on a pledge to strengthen law and order.</p>
      <p>"Down with the right-wing government" read a banner carried by the protesters. "Uprisings do not end up in museums," some of them chanted.</p>
      <p>There were also banners against the government's labour and education reforms, and slogans shouted against US President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</p>
      <p>A pair of protesters burned EU and US flags.</p>
      <p>Some 20,000 people marched in Athens, police said, in remembrance of dozens of people who died in the 1973 military crackdown on a student uprising at the Athens Polytechnic.</p>

      <p>Another 9,000 people demonstrated in Thessaloniki, where protesters threw firebombs at cars, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Separate demonstrations were also held in Greece's other major cities.</p>
      <p>Some 5,000 officers were mobilised in the capital, backed by drones, a helicopter and water cannon, police said, as a precaution against the violence that regularly breaks out during the annual protest.</p>
      <p>Several youths were arrested after Molotov firebombs and stones were found on a roof in the bohemian district of Exarchia, in an apparent plan to ambush riot police passing below.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, in a move seen as directed against the demonstration, the government secured parliamentary approval of a law applying harsher penalties for public violence.</p>
      <p>Throwing a Molotov cocktail -- a fairly frequent occurrence at demonstrations in Greece -- is now punishable by up to 10 years in prison, up from five years previously.</p>
      <p>- Mayor's appeal -</p>
      <p>The demonstration marks the 46th anniversary of the student uprising. Traditionally, it ends in front of the American embassy, which was ringed with police vans Sunday, as the fervently anti-Communist dictators enjoyed backing from Washington.</p>
      <p>At least 24 people were killed in the 1973 crackdown, an event generally considered to have broken the junta's grip on power and helped the restoration of democracy.</p>

      <p>The bloodstained flag that flew over the Polytechnic's iron gate, which was crushed by a tank that night, was carried at the head of the demonstration in the capital, a longstanding tradition.</p>
      <p>Athens mayor Kostas Bakoyannis, who is the PM's nephew, urged respect for the city.</p>
      <p>"On this anniversary, let's send out the right message. A shared message about memory," he wrote in a Facebook message Friday.</p>
      <p>The anti-junta demonstration is a treasured anniversary for many Greeks.</p>
      <p>- 'Junta applauder' -</p>
      <p>In recent years, demonstrators have used the anniversary to voice opposition to US "imperialism", and the harsh austerity measures imposed on Greece by international creditors after the global financial crisis.</p>

      <p>But Mitsotakis's administration has now come under fire over a flurry of police operations against anarchist squats and demonstrators.</p>
      <p>Leftist main opposition leader Alexis Tsipras became the first former prime minister to take part in the march alongside former ministers.</p>
      <p>He accused the conservative government of harbouring "junta applauders" in its midst, referring to former far-right politicians given cabinet posts by Mitsotakis.</p>

      <p>There is also tension over a recent government amendment to facilitate police checks in universities, which has prompted several student protests.</p>
      <p>"Police have no place in universities... but neither does lawlessness," Citizen's Protection Minister Michalis Chrysohoidis told To Vima weekly on Sunday.</p>
      <p>This week the Polytechnic's rector Andreas Bantouvas said: "We need to be careful these days, and (public) comments must be guarded."</p>
      <p>Justice Minister Kostas Tsiaras, speaking ahead of Wednesday's parliamentary vote, told lawmakers ahead of the vote in parliament: "Laws and regulations are needed for Greek citizens to feel safe."</p>
      <p>On Monday, some 200 students demonstrating at the Athens University of Economics were surrounded by anti-riot police who used tear gas and arrested two protesters.</p>
