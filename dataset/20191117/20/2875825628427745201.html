      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ian-wright">Ian Wright</a> has recalled an emotional meeting with an old teacher who helped him through his troubled childhood.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> striker cried after being reunited with Mr Pidgen as part of a documentary on Wright's career at the Gunners former Highbury stadium.</p>
      <p>Mr Pidgen surprised his former pupil by appearing at the ground where Wright scored the majority of his 185 goals for the club, prompting him to burst into tears.</p>
      <p>Wright was re-telling the story ahead of his involvement on the new series of ITV's 'I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here', with the first episode due to air on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"I literally started to cry like a five-year-old," Wright recalled. "Uncontrollable crying because of how happy I was to see him.</p>

      <p>"Looking back it was then that I realised how much of a positive impact that man had on my life.</p>
      <p>"He's somebody that is very special to me. But I think what was more important to me than anything was how much he actually loved being a teacher.</p>
      <p>"It's amazing what a teacher can do to somebody in their life."</p>

      <p>Wright counts Mr Pidgen as the first real role model he had in his life due to a troubled upbringing, and looked up to him as a father figure.</p>
      <p>He explained to his old teacher that he thought he had passed away previously.</p>
      <p>Wright's father absconded and left mother Nesta to raise her family in a one-bedroom house in Brockley, South London.</p>

      <p>"He was a weed-smoking, gambling, coming-home-late, gambling-his-wages, womanising kind of guy,” Wright told the <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/ian-wright-earning-my-smile">Players' Tribune.</a></p>
      <p>"He was rough with my mum and rough with all of us kids. And I don’t know why, but he didn’t like me in particular.</p>
      <p>Wright, 56, is the favourite to win the ITV hit show, which will see him spend weeks in the Australian jungle, with former England rugby star-turned MMA competitor James Haskell also among the contestants.</p>
