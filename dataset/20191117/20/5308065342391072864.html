      <p>He also added that some adjustments have been made after the recent incident. The report was previously accessible by all fire officers. They have made it more secure by only allowing the employee in charge and their senior official to directly report to each other.</p>
      <p>On 14 Oct, Sulli took her own life in her residence and was believed to be pressured by cyber bullying.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old former f(x) member’s death was classified as suicide by the authorities.</p>
      <p>In South Korea, suicide is the fourth leading cause of death. The suicide rate in the country is at the highest level (10), according to the World Health Organisation.</p>
      <p>South Korea also lead the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with the highest rate of people who commit suicide.</p>
      <p>It is reported <a href="https://www.soompi.com/article/1361311wpp/fxs-luna-bids-farewell-to-sulli-with-heartfelt-message">that lawmakers</a> of South Korea are proposing an act called the ‘Sulli Act’. It is proposed by nine members of the National Assembly and it will tackle the issue of cyber bullying.</p>
