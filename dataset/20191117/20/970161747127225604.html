      <p>BBC’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/time-war-worlds-tonight-cast-11170072/">War of the Worlds launches tonight</a>, sure to pep up audiences’ Sunday evenings with plenty of out-of-this-world thrills.</p>
      <p>The story has been told countless times before, including a modernized take in 2005 starring <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tom-cruise/">Tom Cruise</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tom-cruise/">.</a></p>
      <p>Who wrote the novel and how faithful will the BBC remake be to the original?</p>
      <h3>Who wrote The War of the Worlds?</h3>
      <p>The original novel, The War of the Worlds was written by H.G. Wells.</p>
      <p>Written between 1895 and 1897, the story was one of the earliest to deal with a conflict between mankind and extra-terrestrial life.</p>

      <p>H.G. – Herbert George to his parents – was a prolific British writer.</p>
      <p>Some of his other popular sci-fi works include The Time Machine, The Island of Doctor Moreau and The Invisible Man.</p>

      <p>He is often called ‘the father of science fiction’ and his work earned him an impressive four nominations for the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>
      <p>In addition to his awe-inspiring literary contributions, Wells was a diabetic and co-founded the charity The Diabetic Association in 1934.</p>
      <p>That charity is still active and is known as Diabetes UK today.</p>

      <h3>How similar will the series be to the novel?</h3>
      <p>The BBC have dropped the ‘The’ from the title, but the three-part series starting tonight will be a fairly-faithful adaptation of the text.</p>
      <p>‘HG Wells’ seminal novel has been adapted for the screen many times, but it’s always had a contemporary (and American) setting,’ director Craig Viveiros has commented.</p>
      <p>‘This is the first version to be set in London…during the Edwardian period’ – just as it was in the novel.</p>

      <p>However, George and Amy – played by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rafe-spall/">Rafe Spall</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/poldark/">Poldark</a>’s Eleanor Tomlinson – are new additions.</p>
      <p>The BBC’s War of the Worlds has been adapted by writer Peter Harness who previously explained how the adaptation will stay ‘faithful to the tone and spirit’ of the book, while delivering a ‘contemporary’ twist.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘We have an incredible cast, a brilliant director and a wonderful crew – and I can’t wait for them to explode the terrifying story of the first alien invasion on to our screens.’</p>
      <h3>What other adaptations of The War of the Worlds have there been?</h3>
      <p>The story has been immensely popular since its publication.</p>
      <p>On top of it never being out of print, the story has been told as a musical, as a blockbuster movie and, most memorably, as a radio broadcast in 1938.</p>

      <p>It’s become an <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2013/10/orson-welles-war-of-the-worlds-panic-myth-the-infamous-radio-broadcast-did-not-cause-a-nationwide-hysteria.html">urban legend that the radio program caused a mass panic</a> among listeners who mistook it for a real news broadcast.</p>
      <p>Just to be safe: if you watch the first episode of the three-part series tonight, it’s not a documentary.</p>
