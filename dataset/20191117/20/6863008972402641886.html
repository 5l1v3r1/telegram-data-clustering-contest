      <p>Ukraine's Ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk says German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas will pay a visit to Ukraine on November 18-19.</p>
      <p>"On November 18-19, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas will be visiting Ukraine: This is his second trip to Kyiv in the last five months. We appreciate our German partners' support," the ambassador <a href="https://twitter.com/melnykandrij">wrote</a> on Twitter on November 17.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Foreign Ministers of France and Germany Jean-Yves Le Drian and Heiko Maas in Kyiv on May 30 to discuss "creative ideas" as for the implementation of the Minsk peace agreements on Russia-occupied Donbas.</p>
      <p>The topic of the German official's forthcoming visit to Kyiv has not been reported yet. Experts say it may be related to preparing <a href="https://www.unian.info/politics/10757040-date-for-upcoming-normandy-four-summit-named.html">the Normandy Four summit</a> (of the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France, Germany) in Paris scheduled for December 9.</p>
