      <p>Edinburgh’s Little Voices Big Stars and Rock Choir Live both performed, as well as the Royal Lyceum Theatre Edinburgh’s Community Choir fresh from preparations for An Edinburgh Christmas Carol.</p>
      <p>And Santa Claus truly came to town as he flew over the heads of the waiting crowds.</p>
      <p>The event was hosted by Forth 1's Arlene Stuart.</p>

      <p>It comes after Edinburgh's Christmas market opened yesterday.</p>
      <p>The East Princes Street Gardens stalls and rides will be open from 10am to 10pm every day until Christmas Eve.</p>
      <p>Glasgow also got into the festive spirit tonight with a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/4965141/glasgow-christmas-lights-switch-on-markets/">spectacular fireworks show</a> as the famous George Square lights were turned on.</p>
      <p>The sky above the city chambers was lit up by the pyrotechnics, as the crowd watched on from the packed square.</p>
      <p>Glasgow's first Christmas market opened last weekend at St Enoch Square - with food from around the world on offer.</p>
      <p>And with George Square now adorned with its festive lights, a second market will open there next weekend.</p>
