      <h1>Founder of North Central Family Centre honoured with multicultural award</h1>
      <h2>"It's much more rewarding to me and enriching (in) my life than anything I've ever given out."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:51:51+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/lgiesbrechtpostmedia" target="_blank">Lynn Giesbrecht</a></address>
      <p>When Sandy Wankel first started the North Central Family Centre (NCFC) 18 years ago, she did not expect it to become the hub of multiculturalism and community it is today.</p>
      <p>All she started with was the idea that every child deserves a safe place in which to live and grow.</p>
      <p>“That was the main focus (of the NCFC) and it became so much more than that. It became all these wonderful people from all these wonderful places that joined us … It became a big family,” Wankel said.</p>
      <p>“It’s always a struggle, but it’s a struggle that’s worth every minute.”</p>
      <p>In front of a room full of supporters and other advocates of multiculturalism at the Government House Saturday afternoon, Wankel was presented with the Multicultural Council of Saskatchewan’s (MCoS) Betty Szuchewycz Award. The award is given each year to someone who has made an outstanding contribution to multiculturalism in the province.</p>
      <p>Wankel said receiving an award that stood for inclusiveness and diversity meant so much to her, as it is those qualities that make the world worth living in.</p>
      <p>“(To) play a small part in bringing people together from all different cultures, and creating an understanding and creating an acceptance and respect through the different cultures, is personally one of the most rewarding things,” she said. “I feel I’ve been really blessed to play a part in that.”</p>
      <p>Nicholas Bage, a third year student in the Saskatchewan Urban Native Teacher Education Program (SUNTEP) through the Gabriel Dumont Institute, was also honoured with the Multicultural Youth Leadership Award.</p>
      <p>Bage said he was inspired by one of his high school teachers and became involved in multicultural work for the first time in Grade 9. Despite his seven years of effort, Bage said the award was completely unexpected.</p>
      <p>“When I was told I was being nominated, I was blown away. I couldn’t really believe it,” he said.</p>
      <p>Being Metis gives Bage the unique perspective of “seeing the two sides of both the colonial world and the traditional world,” he said. This has made him passionate about closing the gaps between those two worlds, and it is this passion that continues to motivate his work.</p>
      <p>He was involved in anti-racism groups in high school, helps put on multicultural workshops while in university and was heavily involved in the Metis Road Allowance Memories project in partnership with Heritage Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>As for Wankel, she hopes to continue her work with the NCFC for as long as she can.</p>
      <p>“It’s much more rewarding to me and enriching (in) my life than anything I’ve ever given out,” she said.</p>
