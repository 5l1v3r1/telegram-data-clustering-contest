        <b>Cristiano Ronaldo admitted on Sunday that he is not at "100 percent" after reacting angrily to twice being substituted by Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri earlier this month.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 34-year-old scored his 99th international goal on Sunday as reigning champions Portugal qualified for Euro 2020 with a hardfought 2-0 win in Luxembourg.</p>
      <p>"I wasn't 100 percent and I'm still not," he said. "In the last three weeks, I have played at a slightly reduced capacity.</p>
      <p>"But when it comes to sacrificing myself for my club and my national team, I do it with pride."</p>
      <p>Sarri said Ronaldo had a "little knee problem" after replacing him during Juventus' 1-0 win over AC Milan last weekend, despite media reports that the five-time Ballon d'Or winner had left the stadium before the end of the match.</p>
      <p>"I don't like to be replaced, no one does," added Ronaldo. "I tried to help Juve even when injured."</p>
      <p>Juventus are back in action with a visit to fifth-placed Atalanta in Serie A on Saturday.</p>
