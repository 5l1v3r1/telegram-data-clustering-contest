        <b>Lewis Hamilton was penalised for a crash that ended Alex Albon’s hopes of a maiden top-three finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lewis Hamilton apologised for denying Alex Albon a first Formula One podium finish when he shunted his fellow driver off the track at the Brazilian Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>World champion Hamilton took responsibility for the crash in the closing stages at Interlagos when he went down the inside rather than take the racing line heading into a corner.</p>
      <p>It would have been an audacious overtaking move, but Hamilton could not get past second-placed Albon and the pair collided, with the Red Bull spinning off the circuit. He finished a lowly 14th.</p>
      <p>Pierre Gasly went past both men to take an unlikely second place for Toro Rosso, with Hamilton crossing the line third for Mercedes. However, Stewards later imposed a five-second penalty that knocked Hamilton down to seventh.</p>
      <p>Hamilton was asked after the race whether he had enough space and speed to execute the move.</p>
      <p>“Honestly, I didn’t, but he did a great job. He was very fair with where he positioned the car,” Hamilton said. “I massively apologise to Albon.</p>
      <p>“I went for a move where the gap was kind of there but it closed right at the end – completely my fault.”</p>

      <p>Race winner Max Verstappen, also of Red Bull, and Hamilton fought a gripping battle for most of the race, until the drama moved up a level amid safety car disruptions in the final 20 laps.</p>
      <p>“It was a great race. Max did a fantastic job today. They [Red Bull] just outclassed us in terms of overall performance. We couldn’t keep up with them on the straights,” Hamilton said.</p>
      <p>“I raced my heart out. I gave everything and I took a lot of risks today as you saw.</p>
      <p>“We could keep up with them [the Red Bulls] through the corners, but they were just outshining us on the straights, so I don’t think there was anything I could do.”</p>
