      <h1>Faroe Islands Plans to Recognize Jerusalem as Capital of Israel</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:53:29+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/hlj/" target="_blank">Hana Levi Julian</a></address>
      <p>The beautiful self-governing archipelago of islands in the Atlantic Ocean that is called the Faroe Islands is planning to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and intends to open an office for diplomatic representation here, according to a report in the Danish-language Politiken newspaper.</p>
      <p>According to the report, Faroese Foreign Minister Jenis av Rana is working to advance the plan; he told the paper, “We have requested funds to open [the office] in September or October 2020. It is, in fact, a recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.”</p>
      <p>Although the Faroe Islands are autonomous, they are a part of Denmark, whose government is not happy with this decision.</p>
      <p>However, Christianity is very strong on the archipelago, and Rana said “the Faroe Islands loves Israel.”</p>
      <p>Denmark, however, has not made any move to relocate its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, nor to open any diplomatic office in the capital.</p>
      <p>There has been no comment on the report from Israel’s Foreign Ministry.</p>
