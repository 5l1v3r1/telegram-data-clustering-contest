      <p>For one girl band, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/24/spice-girls-prepare-glowing-tribute-victoria-beckham-tour-putting-animosity-bed-9672569/">friendship never ends</a>. For others… it’s not always so smooth.</p>
      <p>Girls Aloud – made up of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/cheryl-fernandez-versini/">Cheryl</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/sarah-harding/">Sarah Harding</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nicola-roberts/">Nicola Roberts</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kimberly-walsh/">Kimberly Walsh</a> – were created through the ITV talent show Popstars: The Rivals in 2002.</p>
      <p>After winning the show, the band became one of Britain’s biggest pop bands, earning 20 consecutive top 10 singles in the United Kingdom, including four number ones.</p>
      <p>But the band have since gone their separate ways, with a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/22/kimberley-walsh-splashes-cold-water-girls-aloud-reunion-dreams-not-cards-10440388/">reunion ‘highly unlikely</a>.’ What went wrong with the Biology hit makers?</p>

      <h3>Did Girls Aloud fall out?</h3>
      <p>It’s fair to say that the five girls might have been great as a band, but that doesn’t mean they always had to be great friends.</p>
      <p>Nadine has hinted at problems between the girls in the past.</p>
      <p>On an episode of Celebrity Juice, she told Keith Lemon that she doesn’t see the girls any more.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>She suggested ‘there was no fallout’ but ‘there was just no friendship to begin with.’</p>
      <p>She hinted at a possible cause for the problems to The Sun back in 2017: ‘It was fine at the start but there’s always politics in any band. It just happened that I always got more vocals than everybody else, so in terms of people wanting their voice heard, that wasn’t happening. And it made people very bitter. They didn’t like that.’</p>

      <p>And Cheryl, speaking with the BBC, appeared to support this, stating she didn’t enjoy Girls Aloud’s final tour in 2012.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘There were still some underlying issues that had never been addressed, sadly. It could have been a lot more fun than it was for us.’</p>
      <p>But on a brighter note for fans of the band, she added: ‘There were great bits, too. Times when we cried from laughing. It just didn’t have to be as tough as it was sometimes. That’s all.’</p>
      <p>Her <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/11/30/cheryl-throws-major-shade-as-she-leaves-nadine-coyle-and-sarah-harding-out-of-girls-aloud-anniversary-post-7122077/">leaving two of the five girls off her Girls Aloud anniversary post</a> can’t have helped much, though.</p>
      <p>Individually a lot of the girls have shown support to one another over the years.</p>
