        <b>Nicholas Cage is said to be in talks to star in The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent which will have him starring as a fictional version of himself.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The actor will portray a dramatised version of himself struggling to land a role in Quentin Tarantino’s latest movie.</p>
      <p>This is probably the perfect opportunity for method acting.</p>
      <p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film has Nicholas speaking to an ‘egotistical 1990s version of himself who rides him for making too many crappy movies and for not being a star anymore.’</p>
      <p>Wow, we didn’t think we would see a meta self-burn from the actor himself.</p>
      <p>The movie has been written by Tom Gormican and Kevin Etten and it’s clear the two have had Nicholas on their minds for a while.</p>
      <p>It will show the National Treasure star struggling with debt and forced to make an appearance at a Mexican billionaire’s bash for cash.</p>

      <p>The concept of the film was so big that HBO Max and Paramount fought over the rights before getting beat out by Lionsgate.</p>

      <p>It wouldn’t be a real movie about his real but fake self without references to Leaving Leas Vegas, Face-Off and Gone in 60 Seconds.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Nicolas will also be starring in a new horror film called Wally’s Wonderland.</p>
      <p>This is what happens when people ask: ‘Where’s Wally?’ and not: ‘How’s Wally?’.</p>
      <p>He will be playing the lead role which follows a janitor who is forced to spend the night in a twisted amusement park where he is pulled into a living nightmare.</p>
      <p>Sounds like everyone’s worst nightmare to be honest.</p>
      <p>The film, which will begin production in January, is to be directed by Kevin Lewis.</p>
      <p>It looks like Nicolas Cage is back and here to showcase his incredible talent as the most diverse actor in Hollywood.</p>
