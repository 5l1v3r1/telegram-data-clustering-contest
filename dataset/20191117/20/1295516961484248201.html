        <b>SPOILER WARNING: This article contains major stories for "Tell Me the Truth," the latest episode of <i>Batwoman</i>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kate Kane's secret identity got even more complicated in "Tell Me the Truth," the latest episode of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/batwoman-tv/"><i>Batwoman</i></a>. Sophie made good on her threat to reveal Kate's Bat-secret to her father Jacob. However, the man Sophie spoke with wasn't Jacob -- it was Mouse, Alice's "brother."</p>
      <p>Throughout the episode, Jacob was away on a mission to learn more about Alice's whereabouts, which kept him from attending his own divorce proceedings and the Crows' attempt to capture Batwoman. This gave Mouse ample opportunity to step in for a day or two, so -- when Sophie seized her moment to confess -- it wasn't who she thought at all.</p>

      <p>While Jacob spent his time upstate, Mouse aimed the Crows at an assassin who had killed several Hamilton Dynamics scientists. Soon, the assassin found himself in possession of a gun capable of penetrating Batwoman's suit. Fearing for Kate's safety, Sophie told "Jacob" that Batwoman was actually his daughter, so that he would protect her rather than let her be killed. As a result, "Jacob" sent the Crows out to stop the assassin, thus sparing Batwoman.</p>
      <p>As Sophie struggled with the difficult decision to out Kate, Batwoman and her allies hatched a plot to convince the Crow that Kate wasn't the vigilante after all. When her old flame Julia Pennyworth came to town, she helped Kate out by pretending to be Batwoman. As a result, Kate and Batwoman appeared in the same room at the same time, thus proving to Sophie that Kate wasn't Batwoman.</p>

      <p>Successfully convinced Kate wasn't Batwoman, Sophie recanted her statement to "Jacob." However, a scene at the end of the episode showed Jacob driving back to Gotham, having turned up nothing important on his search. Worse, the following scene revealed Mouse taking off his Jacob disguise. He promised he sowed some discord in the Kane family's lives, though he was not specific as to how.</p>
      <p>Created by Caroline Dries and developed by Berlanti Productions and Warner Bros. Television, <i>Batwoman</i> stars Ruby Rose, Rachel Skarsten, Meagan Tandy, Camrus Johnson, Dougray Scott, Elizabeth Anweis and Nicole Kang. The series airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on The CW.</p>
