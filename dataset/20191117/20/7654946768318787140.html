      <h1>Odell Beckham thinks he’s a target for NFL drug tests</h1>

      <p>Odell Beckham Jr. isn’t pleased about being subjected to another PED test from the NFL.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2019/11/odell-beckham-jr-tells-clevelandcom-hes-upset-over-volume-of-random-drug-tests-nobody-is-getting-tested-like-me.html">Speaking with Cleveland.com</a> after the Browns’ 21-7 win over the Steelers on Thursday, the wide receiver spoke out about the league’s random testing.</p>
      <p>“[The NFL] made me come in Monday when we had an off day. Had a drug test,” Beckham explained. “Made me come in Thursday after the game. Had another drug test.”</p>
      <p>Beckham has been on the league’s radar this season for <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/03/nfl-orders-odell-beckham-jarvis-landry-to-change-wild-cleats/">his bold accessories</a>, but it appears the continuous requests are testing the wideout’s patience.</p>
      <p>“I know people who didn’t get tested for five months in the offseason and I’m getting tested every time,” Beckham said.</p>
      <p>When asked about Beckham’s statements, NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy addressed the league’s policy without mention of the three-time Pro Bowler.</p>
      <p>“Neither the union or the league are involved in the random selection of players to be tested,” <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2019/11/nfl-wont-respond-specifically-to-odell-beckham-jr-saying-hes-ped-tested-more-than-anyone-but-stands-by-random-nature-of-testing.html">McCarthy said to the outlet</a>. “By means of a computer program, the independent administrator determines which 10 players will be randomly selected each week.”</p>
      <p>Beckham is hardly the first NFL player to complain about the league’s testing. Last fall, Panthers safety Eric Reid said he had been tested multiple times, too.</p>
      <p>“This is like the fifth time since I’ve been here,” Reid said at the time, <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/11/09/nfl-says-ped-testing-is-random-after-eric-reid-raises-questions/">per Pro Football Talk</a>. “They’re not going to catch me on anything.”</p>
