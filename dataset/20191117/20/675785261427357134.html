      <h1>Roy Keane tears into Man Utd transfer target Declan Rice in scathing review</h1>
      <h2>The West Ham midfielder played the full 90 minutes of England's 4-0 victory over Kosovo but was criticised by the ITV pundit ahead of the game</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:41:19+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:41</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Roy Keane said Declan Rice still has many areas to improve on as he continues to be linked with a move to his former club <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>Rice featured for England during their 4-0 thrashing of Montenegro, winning his seventh cap for the Three Lions after opting to turn down the Republic of Ireland.</p>
      <p>His performances have been mixed for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> so far this season, however, and Keane thinks the 20-year-old has much to work on if he is to compete at the very highest level.</p>
      <p>Speaking to ITV ahead of the game against Kosovo Keane said: "Where he needs to improve, there are plenty of aspects when you think about it.</p>

      <p>"Over the last few months he has had a lot of praise, I worked with him when he was with the Ireland squad.</p>
      <p>"Where does he need to improve, where do you want me to start? His positional play, I don't think is consistent enough, he doesn't stay with runners, he's sloppy in possession.</p>
      <p>"I can go on. He's one of those players, a couple of months ago everyone was enjoying him and loved him. He's one of those players that's now played his way out of the team because he's not been consistent for West Ham."</p>
      <p>Rice went on to be outshone by his fellow central midfielder Harry Winks against Kosovo, with the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> man scoring the side's opening goal and winning the Man of the Match award.</p>

      <p>Rice has been part of the Hammers team that has slumped dramatically in the Premier League, with Manuel Pellegrini's side failing to win in the division since their victory against United in September, losing four of their last six games.</p>
      <p>He will next be in action when they take on rivals Tottenham at the London Stadium on November 23.</p>
