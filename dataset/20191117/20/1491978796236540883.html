        <i>Ben Chilwell and Harry Kane were impressive for England, while Fidan Aliti struggled for Kosovo</i>
      </p>
      <h3>Kosovo (4-3-3)</h3>
      <p><b>Arijanet Muric </b>The Manchester City goalkeeper repelled effort by clubmate Sterling but had no chance with goals. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Mergim Vojvoda </b>Showed some neat touches on the ball and gave <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/kosovo">Kosovo</a> a presence in both halves. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Amir Rrahmani </b>The no-nonsense captain squandered a free header moments after glancing Berisha’s effort wide. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Fidan Aliti </b>Went missing for opener and his sliced clearance fell to Kane for England’s second. <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>Benjamin Kololli </b>His rampaging runs provided a threat down the left . Booked for manhandling Sterling. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Bersant Celina </b>The Swansea winger operated centrally and provided a touch of class. Spurned inviting chance. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Ibrahim Dresevic </b>Went to sleep as Winks waltzed through on goal unchallenged. Late slip allowed Mount to strike. <b>4</b></p>
      <p><b>Valon Berisha </b>Seemed to hold the upper hand against a youthful and, at times, green <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/england">England</a> midfield. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Florent Hadergjonaj </b>The high-energy Huddersfield defender made a dent on the right wing but faded. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Atdhe Nuhiu </b>Burly Sheffield Wednesday striker relished leading the line in the absence of Vedat Muriqi. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Milot Rashica </b>Was lively down the left, testing Pope from distance and got the better of Alexander-Arnold. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Subs</b> Besar Halimi (for Berisha 65) <b>7</b>, Edon Zhegrova (for Hadergjonaj 73) <b>6</b>, Elba Rashani (for Nuhiu 82) <b>6</b></p>

      <h3>England (4-3-3)</h3>
      <p><b>Nick Pope </b>Largely untroubled on full England debut but among those guilty of getting sloppy. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Trent Alexander-Arnold </b>An off night. Occasionally exposed and failed to torment opposition defence going forward. <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>Harry Maguire </b>Did not do a lot wrong but at the heart of a defence that struggled to convince. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Tyrone Mings </b>Not at his imposing best. Had hands full with Nuhiu, who ensured a heavyweight battle. <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>Ben Chilwell </b>Another fine performance. His gallivanting down the left was a catalyst for England throughout. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain </b>Slipped in Winks for opener. Has been involved in six goals in past seven games. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Declan Rice </b>Another who grew into the game. Made a crucial block to deny Rashica late on. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Harry Winks </b>Failed to assert himself until bursting into the box and coolly slotting home his first England goal. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Raheem Sterling </b>A low-key return. Wonderfully weighted pass supplied Rashford for England’s third. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Harry Kane </b>Quiet until rattling a post on the hour mark. Slammed home second to maintain scoring streak. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Callum Hudson-Odoi </b>The teenager struggled on his second start. Too often his final pass disappointed. <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>Subs</b> Marcus Rashford (for Hudson-Odoi 59) <b>7</b>, Mason Mount (for Oxlade-Chamberlain 72) <b>6</b>, Fikayo Tomori (for Alexander-Arnold 84) <b>6</b></p>
