      <p>(CNN) - Over $20 million worth of property went up in flames early Saturday in Florida, where two multimillion-dollar yachts were destroyed in a fire.</p>
      <p>More than 60 firefighters and three fire boats battled the blaze at Universal Marine Center docks in Fort Lauderdale, working to prevent the fire from spreading to other yachts nearby.</p>
      <p>Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue reported that nobody was injured.</p>
      <p>Officials believe the blaze began on a 160-foot yacht named Lohengrin and spread to a neighboring 100-foot yacht named Reflections.</p>
      <p>The estimated loss from the fire is more than $20 million, said Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue.</p>
      <p>Crews were still on the scene of the fire Sunday, working to remove scaffolding surrounding the boats and extinguish hot spots, according to a Twitter post by Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue.</p>
      <p>The yachts appear to have been under construction prior to the fire, indicated by scaffolding and tarps surrounding the boats.</p>
      <p>After the hot spots have been snuffed out, Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue said they will begin salvage efforts and an investigation into what caused the blaze.</p>
