      <h1>The Gareth Southgate comments that could be bad news for Spurs star Danny Rose's England future</h1>
      <h2>The England manager has been speaking about his full-back options after starting Leicester City's Ben Chilwell ahead of Danny Rose</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Warlow</a></address>
      <p>It was another night on the sidelines for Tottenham star Danny Rose as England faced Kosovo in Pristina this evening (Sunday).</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> full-back was an unused substitute as England completed their group stage schedule with 4-0 win away against Kosovo, with Leicester City star Ben Chilwell starting instead at left-back and playing the full 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>It was perhaps little surprise after Chilwell put in a man-of-the-match performance for the Three Lions against Montenegro at Wembley on Thursday, with the Leicester full-back impressing in recent weeks for club and country.</p>
      <p>But when England boss Gareth Southgate explained his team selection in a pre-match interview with ITV Sport, he offered an insight into his thinking as the Three Lions continue their preparations for the European Championships next summer.</p>
      <p>And it may not be good news for Rose's England future.</p>

      <p>“We wanted to get the balance with some consistency from what we did in the last game," Southgate told ITV Sport ahead of the game against Kosovo.</p>
      <p>“We knew we would make some changes, but also we want to cement some, and these [Chilwell and Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold] are both young players with not so many caps, so this sort of game is a good experience for them.”</p>
      <p>Southgate's comments could also spell bad news for former Spurs defender Kieran Trippier, with Alexander-Arnold preferred ahead of the Atletico Madrid man.</p>
