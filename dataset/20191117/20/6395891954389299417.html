      <p><b>WORCESTER, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - A Massachusetts man convicted of causing the death of a state police trooper faces sentencing this week.</p>
      <p>David Njuguna (en-juh-GOO'-nuh) is scheduled to be sentenced Thursday in Worcester Superior Court.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old Webster man was convicted last Tuesday of involuntary manslaughter in the March 2016 death of Trooper Thomas Clardy.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say Njuguna was speeding and high on pot when he struck Clardy's stopped cruiser on the Massachusetts Turnpike in Charlton. The 44-year-old Clardy was a father of seven.</p>
      <p>Judge Janet Kenton-Walker cleared Njuguna of OUI manslaughter and felony motor vehicle homicide because prosecutors had not proved he was high.</p>
      <p>The defendant's lawyers argued that he suffered a medical-related seizure that caused the crash.</p>
      <p>Njuguna faces up to 20 years behind bars on the manslaughter charge.</p>
