      <h1>ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith, Eric Reid feud over Colin Kaepernick workout</h1>

      <p>ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith and Eric Reid, a Carolina Panthers safety who’s friends with Colin Kaepernick, engaged in a war of words on Twitter after Smith posted a video saying Kaepernick doesn’t actually want to return to the NFL after backing out of the workout the league organized for him and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/colin-kaepernicks-nfl-workout-last-minute-change-causes-chaos/">holding his own workout at a Georgia high school</a>.</p>
      <p>After Reid responded to <a href="https://twitter.com/stephenasmith/status/1195866091068764160?s=20">Smith’s video</a> Saturday night by saying Smith was “tap dancing for the NFL,” Smith went on a multi-tweet tirade in which he indicated Reid was hypocritical because he makes money playing in the league.</p>
      <p>“Maybe the enemy is YOU, your childish tendencies and your unwillingness to accept that you can’t run a damn thing but so much when your hand is out for someone else’s dime or product,” Smith wrote.</p>
      <p>The feud continued Sunday as Reid responded to Smith’s tweetstorm.</p>
      <p>“Malcolm X said, “If you’re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.” You embody this quote,” Reid tweeted. “You, Malcolm Jenkins, and Jay-Z prance around doing the NFL’s bidding to try 2 burry Colin. I stand 4 truth &amp; justice above all else. You r mistaken by thinking that because u or anybody is black that you are spared from my criticism especially when you’ve been so blatantly on the NFL’s side in corrupting their own process to hinder Colin’s employment.”</p>
      <p>In a long reply, Smith called Reid out for tweeting hours before playing a game and said Reid went through the same process Kaepernick is supposed to go through, and Reid is still in the league.</p>
      <p>“I still respect the hell out of your immature, belligerent self. But I’m going to call it like I see it. Kaepernick made a mistake the way he handled all this…….IF he really wants a job in the NFL. Period,” Smith wrote. “And your contribution to all of this doesn’t help. It hurts. It ain’t about you being wrong. It’s about you needing to grow the hell up. Your decision. Your life. Do you!”</p>
      <p>In his original video, Smith criticized Kaepernick for pulling out of the NFL-organized workout at the Atlanta Falcons’ practice facility and moving it to a high school an hour away.</p>
      <p>“You see, he don’t want to play. He wants to be a martyr,” Smith said. “But guess what? It ain’t working this time. All of us believe that Colin Kaepernick would’ve showed out, and if he had showed out, I’m here to tell you I believe he would’ve had a job inside of two weeks. But it didn’t happen because he didn’t show.”</p>
