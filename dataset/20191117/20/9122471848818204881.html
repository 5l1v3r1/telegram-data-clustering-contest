      <h1>FOX Announcer’s Reaction To Vikings’ 1st Half Is Going Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:03:01+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Letdown games happen in the NFL all the time. The Minnesota Vikings are going through one right now.</p>
      <p>Minnesota came into today’s game against the 3-6 Denver Broncos with a 7-3 record, fresh off a big primetime win last Sunday in Dallas.</p>
      <p>At halftime, they trailed Denver 20-0. Nothing went right for the Vikings in the first 30 minutes, a fact summed up nicely by CBS play-by-play man Kevin Harlan.</p>
      <p>Here’s what Harlan had to say after the Vikings fumbled away a kickoff late in the second quarter.</p>

      <p>Fortunately for Minnesota, there are two halves to every football game. The second half began much more auspiciously for the guys in purple, with Kirk Cousins leading the team to a touchdown early in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Denver still leads 20-7, but the Vikings have some life.</p>
