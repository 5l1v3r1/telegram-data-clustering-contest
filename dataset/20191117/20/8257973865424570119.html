      <p>Nov. 17 (UPI) -- At least seven people were killed in a gas pipeline explosion in Bangladesh on Sunday, police officials said.</p>
      <p>Bijoy Boshak, deputy commissioner of the Chottogram Metropolitan Police, confirmed<a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/bangladesh-gas-pipeline-blast-kills-7-injured-25-/1647665"> seven deaths</a>: one child, four men and two women who were severely burned at the scene of the explosion.</p>
      <p>The explosion took place in the morning in front of a five-story building in the city of Chottogram, blowing some doors of the structure, witnesses told police.</p>
      <p>The street in front of the building was busy with pedestrians and a <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/at-least-seven-killed-in-gas-explosion-in-bangladesh-11863141">boundary wall fell</a> on some passersby.</p>
      <p>"We primarily came to know that due to the gas pipeline blast, a part of the building collapsed," said Boshak.</p>
      <p>Boshak added that the death toll may rise as police chief Mohammed Mohsin said at least 25 people were hospitalized with injuries, including some in critical condition.</p>
      <p>Local police and firefighters were still conducting rescue operations in the building.</p>
      <p>The cause of the explosion wasn't immediately clear.</p>
