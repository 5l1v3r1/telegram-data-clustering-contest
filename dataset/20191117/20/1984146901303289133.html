      <p>It was 17 years ago that Ant &amp; Dec first took us into the jungle for the very first series of I'm A Celebrity and now they're back for a new series.</p>
      <p>Yes, it was in 2002 that legendary radio DJ Tony Blackburn became the show's first ever winner, beating the likes of the late Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, Darren Day and Christine Hamilton.</p>
      <p>Since then the likes of Kerry Katona, Dougie Poynter, Christopher Biggins, Vicky Pattison and Scarlett Moffatt have all triumphed in the jungle and before long, we now know who'll be following in their footsteps this year.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-lineup-confirmed-16118148">I'm A Celebrity line-up</a> for this year includes Girls Aloud singer Nadine Coyle, GMB host Kate Garraway and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-adele-big-brother-17262435">Radio DJ Adele Roberts who has a shocking Big Brother past.</a></p>
      <p>Ant returns to host <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> after missing last year due to his lengthy break from TV following his drink driving conviction.</p>
      <h3>How old are Ant &amp; Dec?</h3>
      <p>They are both very nearly the same age.</p>
      <p>Dec is slightly older. Born on September 25, 1975, he is now 44 years old. Ant is slightly younger. Born on November 18, 1975, he turns 44 on Monday.</p>
      <p>The pair of course shot to fame in the early 90s on Newcastle-set BBC children's series Byker Grove.</p>

      <p>They left the show in 1994 to pursue a pop career which gave them hits like Eternal Love, Stuck On U and of course Let's Get Ready to Rhumble.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ant-dec-1">Ant &amp; Dec</a> have hosted countless hit TV shows like Friends Like These, Pop Idol, Britain's Got Talent, The Brit Awards and of course I'm A Celebrity.</p>
