      <p>HP said the bid “significantly undervalues” the company, but added that it remained open to a potential merger and hoped for further engagement with Xerox management.</p>
      <p>“[The board] has unanimously concluded that it [offer] significantly undervalues HP and is not in the best interests of HP shareholders,” the California-based firm said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“In reaching this determination, the board also considered the highly conditional and uncertain nature of the proposal, including the potential impact of outsized debt levels on the combined company’s stock.”</p>
      <p>HP added that it had taken Xerox’s annual revenue decline into consideration when making the decision.</p>
      <p>Xerox made the combined cash and share offer earlier in November, HP confirmed. The bid had previously been announced, but the value of the deal was only revealed today.</p>
      <p>Xerox had offered HP shareholders $22 per share, made up of $17 in cash and 0.137 Xerox shares for each HP share, according to a letter dated 5 November.</p>
      <p>The offer would have given HP shareholders control of roughly 48 per cent of the company.</p>
