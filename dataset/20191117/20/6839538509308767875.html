      <p>Reeling from a deadly flu season that killed 106 South Australians, the State Government will make children’s vaccinations easier to access.</p>
      <p>Currently children have to be at least 16 to skip the doctor and go to a chemist. Health Minister Stephen Wade said lowering that age would increase the proportion of vaccinated children. Flu has killed 106 South Australians this year.</p>
      <p>Mr Wade said flu was “very dangerous” and getting more children vaccinated would build up herd immunity in SA.</p>
      <p>“We have just experienced a particularly bad flu season and it is important we are proactive in preventing the disease by ensuring as many people are vaccinated as possible,” he said.</p>
      <p>SA’s chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier said it would boost the number of immunised children because it would be easier for families to fit the jab into their busy lives.</p>
      <p>Doctors have previously voiced concerns about pharmacists’ ability to deal with any adverse reactions, but Associate Professor Spurrier, pictured, said many people who were not doctors were already trained to give vaccinations.</p>
      <p>“The important thing is that the person giving the vaccine is trained to look for any side effects and to be in a position to offer care if any of those things happen,” she said.</p>
      <p>The Vaccine and Preventable Diseases Advisory Group will consider a range of issues, including parental consent, and report back to the State Government on making the change to regulations.</p>
      <p>Winston Martin, of Glenelg South, said it would be “a lot more convenient” to take daughter Annabelle, 11, to the pharmacy than a GP.</p>
