      <p>NEW ROCHELLE, New York (WABC) -- There was a big show of support for the New Rochelle High School football coach after <a href="https://abc7ny.com/sports/10-0-ny-high-school-football-coach-reassigned-pending-investigation/5697226/">administrators re-assigned him</a>.</p>
      <p>Football players chanted their support for Louis DiRienzo ahead of winning Saturday's State Tournament against Utica Proctor.</p>
      <p>New Rochelle's new superintendent stripped DiRienzo of his job while she conducts an investigation.</p>
      <p>The district is being tight-lipped but suspects DiRienzo interfered with a student, who is also a relative, calling the child's father to head-off disciplinary action.</p>
      <p>DiRienzo is in the Westchester Hall of Fame for his coaching accomplishments.</p>
