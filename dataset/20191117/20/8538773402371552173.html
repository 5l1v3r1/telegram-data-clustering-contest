      <p>Stop challenging pass interference, NFL coaches. Stop. No more. Don't fall for this charade any longer.</p>
      <p>It was clear to most of us weeks ago that the NFL had <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/story/_/id/27868273/nfl-officiating-getting-better-league-blame">punted on enforcing its signature rule change</a> this season. Rather than doing the hard work of establishing a standard for when to overturn pass interference calls and non-calls, the league has sabotaged the rule entirely.</p>
      <p>The preposterous decision to uphold a no-call Sunday afternoon in Baltimore should be a final warning. To that point, coaches had lost 32 of their past 33 pass interference challenges, dating back to the start of Week 4. That's a 3.0% success rate. Since Week 3, they are 2-for-41 (4.9%). In an age when teams have access to all kinds of analytic probabilities, their coaches should now realize the chances of getting an overturn on pass interference -- no matter the severity of the contact -- are slim.</p>
      <p>In a vacuum, no one would blame <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/hou/houston-texans">Houston Texans</a> coach Bill O'Brien for challenging the no-call on a deep end-zone pass to receiver <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15795/deandre-hopkins">DeAndre Hopkins</a>. Whether you saw it live or on slow-motion replay, your eyes told you that <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> cornerback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126356/marlon-humphrey">Marlon Humphrey</a> grabbed Hopkins with his left arm and forcefully twisted him away from the ball before it arrived.</p>

      <p>The definition of pass interference is to "significantly hinder" an opponent from making a play on the ball. I think we can agree Humphrey significantly hindered Hopkins by pulling him away from a ball that was close enough to nearly touch Hopkins' left hand.</p>
      <p>Referee Alex Kemp's crew didn't throw a flag.</p>
      <p>The NFL obviously now has a rule on its books allowing coaches to challenge and rectify such mistakes. When the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/story/_/id/27017122/nfl-finalizes-pi-replay-challenge-rule-2019">rule was introduced</a>, the standard for overturning was "clear and obvious evidence" of an act that significantly hinders an opponent.</p>

      <p>But it's clear that the NFL decided against attempting to establish what that standard would look like. So it stopped trying altogether, a shameful abdication of the responsibility it took on when owners approved the rule in March. On Twitter, Hopkins <a href="https://twitter.com/DeAndreHopkins/status/1196181477488246790">said after Sunday's game</a>: "As a leader in the NFL, we need someone new in New York deciding calls." O'Brien <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/story/_/id/28103490/texans-deandre-hopkins-need-new-deciding-pi-calls">said postgame</a>, "I have no idea what pass interference is anymore. No idea."</p>
      <p>The NFL made the situation worse after the Hopkins play. Al Riveron, senior vice president of officiating, overturned two pass interference challenges, one in favor of the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets">New York Jets</a> and another in favor of the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/ari/arizona-cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a>. Each was a reasonable decision in its own right, but they only called further attention to the dozens of similar calls that have gone unchanged this season, including the one in the Texans-Ravens game earlier in the afternoon. They also gave coaches further, and likely unfounded, incentive to continue challenging pass interference calls.</p>
      <p>And coaches are the unfortunate, and initially unwitting, victims through it all. They have been wasting timeouts and challenges for a good part of the season, hoping that the league would settle into a semi-predictable pattern.</p>
      <p>But coaches should no longer be unwitting. They know the numbers. Through its actions, the NFL has begged coaches to stop challenging pass interference and putting the league in a position it can't handle. It's time for coaches to accept that and move on.</p>
