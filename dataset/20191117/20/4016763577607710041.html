      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:42:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:42</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Kelley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/meek-mill">Meek Mill</a> just held a Q&amp;A session on Twitter, where he revealed the top five rappers of his “era.”</p>
      <p>The Philly rapper named <a href="https://genius.com/artists/jay-z">JAY-Z</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/lil-wayne">Lil Wayne</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/rick-ross">Rick Ross</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/jadakiss">Jadakiss</a>, and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/dmx">DMX</a>:</p>

      <p>It makes sense that Hov would make it into the final lineup. Earlier this year, he signed a <a href="https://genius.com/a/meek-mill-signs-a-deal-for-his-dream-chasers-record-label-under-jay-z-s-roc-nation">joint-venture deal with Roc Nation</a> for his Dream Chasers label. Jay also recruited him for a <a href="https://genius.com/a/meek-mill-rapsody-meghan-trainor-to-perform-at-first-nfl-concert-since-roc-nation-partnership">kick-off event at the NFL</a> alongside <a href="https://genius.com/artists/rapsody">Rapsody</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/meghan-trainor">Meghan Trainor</a> in September.</p>
      <p>Both JAY-Z and Ross previously featured on Meek’s <a href="https://genius.com/Meek-mill-whats-free-lyrics">“What’s Free”</a> last year. The <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Meek-mill/Championships">Championships</a></i> artist called it his favorite track off his latest album:</p>

      <p>As Genius user @<a href="https://genius.com/DripKingX">DripKingX</a> points out, he talked about the collaboration in an interview with <i><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/us/2018/11/30/meek-mill-jay-z-kanye-red-hat-represents-smerconish-sot-vpx.cnn">CNN</a></i>. “I had dreams of having a JAY-Z verse my whole life, being able to rap with JAY-Z, who I view as the greatest of all time,” he said. “Whatever he did, I was just going to accept it, and that’s what he gave me… and I was happy with that.”</p>
      <p>During the Q&amp;A session, he also hinted that a new album might drop before the end of the year.</p>
