            <b>HIM Vs RAI Dream11 Team : Struggling in the trenches of Group C, anything less than a win for Himachal Pradesh all but wraps up their 2019 sortie.</b>
          </p>
          <p>Two sides, one match and completely different agendas. Where Railways have aspirations of moving to the echelons of Group C in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, Himachal Pradesh on the other hand are trying to keep themselves alive in their bid of challenging for a spot in the next round, a position which is slowly slipping away from them.</p>
          <p>Barring from a late surge, Himachal Pradesh’s resurgence in the marquee tournamnet looks improbable. The team have been embroiled in an ordeal, one which sees them slumped into seventh place in the group with the side clearly bereft of ideas to wrench out of their impasse. They have managed to muster up a mere two wins in six matches to see the deficit between themselves and Railways stand at eight points as things stand.</p>

                <p>The side enter the flay of today’s encounter frayed in their last tie, an outing which saw them defeated by 8 wickets by Maharashtra. It was an encounter in which they were comprehensively dismantled and outplayed in all the departments of the game with their mere 135 never enough o play a real challenge infront of Maharashtra. </p>
                <p>Elsewhere, Railway pulled off an incredible win over Chandigarh, a result which impressed not only owing to the manner it came about in but the identity of the side they managed to put down as well. It was a humdinger of a match, an edge of the seat thriller which saw them manage to win by the barest of margins with the team managing to hang onto the 196 runs they had piled up by the solitary run to make it three wins in succession.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>With the sun set to bake the track and with this being the second encounter of the day to be contested over here, the side winning the toss is going to be a regulation decision. The pitch will be a good track for batting early on with strokeplay being rewarded once you have settled into your groove but eventually as the encounter traverses, spinners will come into full effect to leave the bats perplexed. </p>

                            <p>
                              <b>Himachal Pradesh </b>

                            </ul>
                            <h3>HIM Vs RAI Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Dinesh Mor from Railways’ unit will be brought into our Dream 11 side for the day owing due to two reasons. While he’s always capable of piling on the runs in the death overs, the wicket-keeper will be behind the wickets against a side who are prone to shambolic collapses, a discourse which should see him garner a slew of catches and stumpings as well.</p>
                            <h3>HIM Vs RAI Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>After piling on a gigantic 196 runs the last time, Railways doled out a performance which epitomised the immense slew of wordclass batters imbedded in the setup. It sees us opt for both the top run getters in the form of Pratham Singh and Mrunal Devdhar with the two bound to manifest their expansive strokeplay in tandem to exult us in a gripping narrative.</p>
                            <p>From Himachal Pradesh we have finally opted for our first name as well with the lone pick from the side being of Prashant Chopra with their leading run getter having allied up 155 runs till now.</p>
                            <h3>HIM Vs RAI Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Only Rishi Dhawan moves into our setup from Himachal Pradesh whilst it’s a partnership representing us form Railways once more. Karn Sharma will be an effectively player on this wicket with his brand of spin set to perturb an opposition always prone to collapsing and losing its way, something which alongside his elevated role with the bat makes him a solid choice.</p>
                            <p>T Pradeep comes in owing to the role he holds akin to Karn, making this duo one which is set to ring in a solid amount of points into our Dream 11 setup. </p>
                            <h3>HIM Vs RAI Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Things are levelly balanced in this docket of our side with us opting for the two players a piece from either side for this one. From Railways we are choosing their top wicket taker Karthik Raman first with the player having snagged 9 wickets in 6 matches with Himanshu Sangwan set to be his counterpart for the day.</p>
                            <p>New bal operator and death overs bowler, Pankaj Jaswal comes in from the other side owing to his dual role as a player with left hand spinner Mayank Dagar assisting him. If his side are to have any chance of emerging from this one unblemished and salvaging a rare win in their artillery, the spinner will need to send down a restrictive line and length, one which will massively spin away and get rotations away from the right handers.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>We are choosing Mrunal as the captain for the day while Karn Sharma will be the vice-captain.</p>
