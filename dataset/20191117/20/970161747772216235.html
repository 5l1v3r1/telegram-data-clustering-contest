        <b>Gerwyn Price says there is no reason why he can’t win the World Championship after retaining his Grand Slam of Darts title on Sunday night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Iceman was in spectacular form in Wolverhampton as he hammered Peter Wright 16-6, finishing with a 107.86 average against a hapless Snakebite.</p>
      <p>The Welshman completed a dream day which saw him beat Michael van Gerwen for the first time in his career in the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>Price was fantastic against MVG but then a level above against Wright, as he landed 11 maximums and ended with a checkout rate of 48%.</p>
      <p>The Players Championship Finals take place in Minehead next weekend and then attentions turn to the World Championship in London next month.</p>
      <p>The new world number three has never been past the last 16 at Alexandra Palace, but clearly now in sensational form, he is aiming for the top prize in the sport in the coming weeks.</p>

      <p>‘I’ll just be happy to get through the first round, the last couple of years I’ve been bombed out first round, only once I’ve got to the last 16,’ joked Price after his Grand Slam success.</p>
      <p>‘Hopefully this year I’m in better form and I can take to the set format and play a lot better.</p>
      <p>‘No reason why I can’t go there and win that one as well.’</p>
      <p>The £125,000 top prize is the biggest win of Price’s career, with the reward going up from the £110,000 he won last year.</p>
      <p>He also becomes only the seventh player in the history of the PDC to defend a major title, following in the footsteps of Phil Taylor, Raymond van Barneveld, Gary Anderson, Adrian Lewis, Rod Harrington and Michael van Gerwen.</p>
      <p>Price fell just short of the record average in a Grand Slam final, which Taylor set in 2011 with a whopping 109.04 in his 16-4 thrashing of Gary Anderson.</p>
      <p>It was only a few missed darts at double at the end of the game that saw him sink below that mark, having spent much of the contest around the 112 mark.</p>
      <p>The Iceman has now gone second favourite for the World Championship, only behind Van Gerwen in the betting after his wonderful displays against the world number one and Snakebite.</p>
