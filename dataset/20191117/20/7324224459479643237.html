      <p>Michelle Visage has become the latest celebrity to exit Strictly Come Dancing after a tense dance-off.</p>
      <p>Giovanni Pernice admitted he had argued with his partner, but hailed her as an inspiration.</p>
      <p>The star of RuPaul’s Drag Race faced the pairing of AJ Pritchard and Saffron Barker.</p>

      <p>Saying she was competing for “the entire community”, Visage performed her voguing routine again with partner Pernice, but it was not enough for a reluctant judging panel to save the couple.</p>
      <p>All of the judges decided to save Barker and Pritchard, but admitted they were torn by the choice of parings.</p>
      <p>Speaking on her exit, Visage said: “This whole experience has been amazing.</p>
      <p>“At 51 years old and never danced in my life, I never thought I’d be able to do what I have done and to have such an incredible partner.</p>
      <p>“To be here for my husband and my kids and the entire community, that’s why I did what I did.</p>
      <p>“I am so honoured to be welcomed by my new friends here.”</p>

      <p>Pernice admitted that the couple had been through a range of emotions during their time together, but said he has respect for his partner despite their arguments.</p>
      <p>He said: “We laugh, we cry, we fight and we argue and we’ve done everything but I’ve loved every single second. I think you are inspirational.”</p>
      <p>Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse, as well as Amy Dowden and Karim Zeroual, dominated the Strictly live show and earned near-perfect scores.</p>
      <p>Chris Ramsey and Karen Hauer were spared the dance-off despite the judges leaving them second from bottom.</p>
      <p>The final decision was a difficult one for the judges, with the experts torn on who to send home.</p>
      <p>Craig Revel Horwood said: “I’m having a really difficult time with myself over this. This doesn’t normally happen to me. I normally make a very quick, instant decision. This has been really, really difficult.”</p>
      <p>He, and the other judges, decided to save Pritchard and Barker.</p>
      <p>Strictly returns next Saturday at 7pm on BBC One and iPlayer.</p>
