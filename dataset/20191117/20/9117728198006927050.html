      <h1>Binotto says Leclerc and Vettel "should feel very sorry for the team" after crash</h1>

        <b>Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto thinks both of his drivers need to feel sorry for the entire team, as <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/charles-leclerc">Charles Leclerc</a> came together and both got a puncture to end their Brazilian Grand Prix.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Vettel had just lost P4 to Leclerc and fought back coming out of turn 3, with the German having the better run onto the DRS straight. The two went side by side into the braking zone of turn 4 but Vettel slightly moved to the left, making contact and giving both cars a puncture. </p>

      <p>Both drivers were forced to retire from the race. Heart-break at Ferrari, but Binotto thinks it's not the time to blame either driver; they both should be putting the team first rather than themselves.</p>
      <p><i>"I think the drivers need to feel sorry for the team - because at the end, they were free to fight," </i>the 50-year-old Binotto told <i>Sky Sports.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"Free to fight but they know that silly mistakes are something we should avoid for the team itself.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"And today it has been a very small contact I have to say, but there will be time to analyse it, there will be time to look at the video, I don't want to do that in the heat.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"With the drivers, I had already a chat with them and I don't want to judge now, they should not judge now, there will be a time to do it all together."</i>
