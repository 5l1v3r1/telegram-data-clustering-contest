      <h1>This Stat About The Redskins’ Offense Is Absolutely Embarrassing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:51:57+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Week after week new NFL teams seem to be trying to assert themselves as the biggest dumpster fire in the NFL. If it isn’t the Dolphins, it’s the Jets. If it isn’t the Jets, it’s the Giants. If it isn’t the Giants, it’s the Browns.</p>
      <p>But the Washington Redskins have put up an offensive “performance” this season that is putting all of those bad teams to shame.</p>
      <p>With the end of the third quarter of their game against the New York Jets today, Washington went 16 straight quarters without a touchdown.</p>
      <p>Per ESPN’s Rich Cimini, it’s a “feat” that hasn’t been matched since the 2000 Ravens went 21 quarters without a TD.</p>

      <p>But while the 2000 Ravens were able to ride an elite defense through their offensive struggle that year, Washington hasn’t been. They’re 1-8 right now and will in all likelihood drop to 1-9 at the end of the game.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, Washington was able to end that streak at 16 in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Derrius Guice took a pass in the flats from rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins 45 yards for a Washington touchdown.</p>
      <p>On top of breaking the streak, it also served as Haskins’ first-ever passing touchdown.</p>
      <p>But Washington still trails, 34-11, with under 10 minutes remaining. It’s a bittersweet way to end an awful run on offense.</p>
