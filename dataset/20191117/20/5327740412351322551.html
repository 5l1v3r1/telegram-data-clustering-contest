      <p>Last week’s ‘Meet Your Muslim Neighbour’ event served as a way to bridge a gap in the community, says the White Rock Muslim Association (WRMA) outreach co-ordinator.</p>
      <p>Organized by the WRMA, the Nov. 10 event at the South Surrey Recreation and Arts Centre served as an educational venue for people in the South Surrey-White Rock community, Asad Syed said.</p>
      <p>The event featured a presentation on the history of Muslims in Canada and the main pillars of belief in Islam.</p>
      <p>“Various informational posters and literature were available at the event, as well as a display featuring art pieces and clothing from a plethora of different cultures that exist within the Muslim world. The event also included booths such as an Arabic calligraphy station, a henna station, and a food section featuring delicious treats and goodies from across the Muslim world,” Syed told <i>Peace Arch News.</i></p>
      <p>White Rock Mayor Darryl Walker attended with Couns. Anthony Manning and Christopher Trevelyan. Surrey Coun. Linda Annis and Doug Elford also attended.</p>
      <p>“There was a great turnout of community members throughout the afternoon with wonderful discussions taking place between all those present,” Syed told <i>PAN.</i> “The WRMA hopes that events like these will continue to bridge the gap and allow all of us to move towards a tighter knit community.”</p>
