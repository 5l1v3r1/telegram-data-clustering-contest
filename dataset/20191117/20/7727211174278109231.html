      <h1>Tranmere’s set-piece problems continue as Micky Mellon bemoans ‘predictable’ Wycombe goals</h1>
      <h2>Tranmere lost 2-0 to Wycombe Wanderers at Prenton Park on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:20:05+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:20</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Cavilla</a></address>
      <p>The signs were there last Saturday.</p>
      <p>Wycombe’s threat from set-pieces, particularly with the physical presence of Adebayo Akinfenwa at striker, was a real problem for Rovers.</p>
      <p>Both of the Chairboys’ two goals last weekend stemmed from set-piece situations, and history repeated itself at Prenton Park on Sunday afternoon as Gareth Ainsworth’s side secured a 2-0 victory.</p>
      <p>Akinfenwa was left unmarked for a free header for the visitors’ first goal, while Darren Potter conceded a needless penalty to hand the away side full control.</p>
      <p>Matches against teams at the top of the table are not the ones that will determine how Tranmere’s season will unfold. Sticking to basic principles and dealing with clear and obvious threats that opponents pose will, however.</p>
      <p>Micky Mellon was left frustrated at what he described as ‘predictable goals’ as he admitted that Wycombe were everything that Tranmere ‘needed to be.’</p>

      <p>“We knew the threats that we were going to face: Akinfenwa and free-kicks,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The disappointing thing is when you know what you’re going to face and you get undone by the very things that you’re very sure you’re going to have to be good at.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes when you come up against teams, they do things that you haven’t seen in games when you’ve played against them before. Football can be random, but there’s nobody telling me that they came to the game today and never thought that there was going to be direct play from free-kicks. </p>
      <p>Mellon continued: “When you know that the free-kicks are coming in and they’re going to hit Akinfenwa, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see that you’re going to have to be lively around him. We play them again on Wednesday and, if he’s playing, you’re going to have to be lively around Akinfenwa in and around the box from direct free-kicks. There you go—those are the tactics.</p>
      <p>“To see him getting a free header, with nobody around him in a two-yard radius, is a frustrating thing as a manager. For the second one, I know they’ve got good delivery from corners, but people are detailed to go and do their jobs from set-plays. You’ve got to hope, as a manager, that they know to do things properly. </p>
      <p>“You come in at half-time and find yourselves two-nil down from the things that we could predict. You can’t predict a lot of things in a game of football, but to get done on the predictable things is very frustrating and that shapes the game.</p>
      <p>“In the second-half we played some good football, but they were first to an awful lot in their 18-yard box. What they were was what we needed to be, and that was being aggressive in the box to do your jobs. People will say that’s my job as manager to make sure the team is good at that, and it is, but I’ve got two players in Shaun Garnett and Mike Jackson who played at very good levels and that would have been a given. They would have gone out, and you would not have had to say a thing to them, they would have been first in the 18-yard box. They would have taken Akinfenwa on and waited for him. </p>

      <p>“They were better in their 18-yard box defensively and going forward than we were. We can only keep saying to the players to keep being first in both boxes and we will go into training next week and will say that again.”</p>
      <p>Mellon made a double change at the interval by bringing off Liam Ridehalgh and David Perkins, which looked to be a tactical change to spark a second-half comeback.</p>
      <p>Both players were substituted due to injury, however, with Ridehalgh suffering a suspected broken foot.</p>
      <p>“They’re both injured,” revealed the Rovers’ boss.</p>
      <p>“Ridehalgh had a lad stamp on his foot, and we think he might have broken his foot. He’s gone to hospital for an X-ray and Perkins didn’t feel he was able to sprint. He has a bit of a hamstring problem, that might be hanging over from his initial hamstring injury he had. We would have changed the shape anyway, would it have been the same players that came off? Probably not.”</p>
      <p>The two sides will meet again on Wednesday evening to decide whose FA Cup journey will continue, in a game which Mellon hopes to see a response from his players regarding the same ‘asks’ that will be faced.</p>
      <p>He said: “We obviously know each other very well, and it will be the same asks. Not only do we have to do that on evidence from what they’ve done in games before they played us, but we’ve now seen it in two games against them. The players will have no excuse in knowing the asks that they’re going to have. What you now expect is the players to take on the challenge of that.”</p>
