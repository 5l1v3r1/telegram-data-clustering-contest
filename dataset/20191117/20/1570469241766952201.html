      <p>North Korea said on Thursday it had turned down a US offer for fresh talks ahead of a year-end deadline Pyongyang has set for Washington to show more flexibility in negotiations.</p>
      <p>US Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced in Thailand earlier on Sunday that joint US-South Korean military drills would be postponed in an effort to bolster the stalled peace push.</p>
      <p>Pyongyang's official KCNA news agency in a commentary on Friday lashed out at Biden for insulting Kim, calling Biden a "rabid dog" that needs to be put down.</p>
      <p>Biden tops most national opinion polls in the Democratic Party's nominating contest to take on Republican President Trump in a November 2020 election.</p>
      <p>"Joe Biden may be Sleepy and Very Slow, but he is not a “rabid dog,” Trump tweeted. "He is actually somewhat better than that, but I am the only one who can get you where you have to be."</p>
