      <h1>Liverpool's five players to withdraw from international duty and the extent of their injuries</h1>
      <h2>Reds supporters may be worried after Mohamed Salah, Virgil Van Dijk, Joe Gomez, Jordan Henderson and Andy Robertson all missed out on representing their nations</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:13:59+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:13</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool fans will be somewhat concerned after no fewer than five of their players were forced to withdraw from international duty.</p>
      <p>With the busy festive period just around the corner and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> set to compete in the Premier League, Champions League, Carabao Cup and Club World Cup in December, the last thing they need is a lengthy injury list.</p>
      <p>The Reds' next game is a tricky-looking trip to face <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday, before they host Napoli in a crucial Champions League fixture.</p>
      <p>But will they be missing some of their key players for the games?</p>
      <p>Here's a look at each player to withdraw from the internationals and everything we know about their reasons why.</p>
      <h3>1. Mohamed Salah</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Salah first injured his ankle during the Reds' win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> , and aggravated the issue during the huge victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> last weekend.</p>
      <p>As a result he was forced to withdraw from Egypt's games against Kenya and Comoros, and Liverpool granted the forward an extended period off during the break.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/mohamed-salah-shares-ankle-treatment-20892563">Salah recently shared a video of his continuing rehabilitation</a> , but it is still not clear exactly what the extent of the injury is.</p>
      <p>He is a big doubt for the game against Palace.</p>
      <h3>2. Virgil Van Dijk</h3>

      <p>Van Dijk played the full 90 minutes for the Netherlands in their 0-0 draw with Northern Ireland on Saturday, a result which secured their qualification for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>He withdrew from the squad ahead of their game against Estonia on Tuesday, however, with the Dutch FA only saying it was due to "personal circumstances."</p>
      <p>It is not clear exactly what the issue is, or whether he will be back to play against Palace for Liverpool, but Reds fans will be praying their Ballon d'Or-nominated centre-back returns as soon as possible.</p>
      <h3>3. Joe Gomez</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The man at the centre of the 'canteen-gate' row with Raheem Sterling, Gomez was expected to start Sunday's game against Kosovo after coming on as a second-half substitute in England's win against Montenegro</p>
      <p>He was unable to do so, however, after sustaining a knock to the knee in training, but it is looking like he should be ok to face Palace after England boss Gareth Southgate said: "He's absolutely fine. He took a clash of knees yesterday. We scanned it just to be certain and I think he'll be fine in a couple of days, but he wasn't able to train today."</p>
      <h3>4. Jordan Henderson</h3>

      <p>Liverpool skipper Henderson was reportedly the man who defused the Sterling-Gomez clash, but he didn't feature in the squad to take on Montenegro after suffering with a viral infection.</p>
      <p>He therefore returned to Melwood before the game against Kosovo, but the infection is unlikely to keep him out for much longer, and it wouldn't be a surprise to see him back in the Liverpool line-up on Saturday.</p>
      <h3>5. Andy Robertson</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Robertson's case is a curious one, with the left-back initially appearing in perfect health for Scotland's two remaining qualifiers before he suddenly withdrew, citing an ankle injury as the reason.</p>
      <p>His subsequent quotes will come as a worry for Reds fans, with the 25-year-old saying: "For the last two and a half weeks, I've not trained at all for Liverpool. It's a niggling injury which won't go away unless I give it time."</p>
      <p>This would suggest that Robertson should at the very least be out for the Palace game. Whether it ends up being a longer spell on the sidelines remains to be seen.</p>
