      <p>Defender Matthias Ginter scored one goal and was involved in two more as Germany comfortably saw off Belarus 4-0 on Saturday to clinch their place at Euro 2020, helped by Northern Ireland's 0-0 draw with the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>MOENCHENGLADBACH, Germany: Defender Matthias Ginter scored one goal and was involved in two more as Germany comfortably saw off Belarus 4-0 on Saturday to clinch their place at Euro 2020, qualifying for the finals for a record 13th time in a row.</p>
      <p>The inspired Ginter broke the deadlock in the 41st minute with a clever backheel, provided a dummy which allowed Leon Goreztka to score the second and the pass for Toni Kroos to add the third.</p>

      <p>Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer saved a penalty from Igor Stasevich in the 75th minute and Kroos added a fourth to complete his first national team brace since the 7-1 World Cup semi-final win over Brazil in 2014.</p>
      <p>Group C leaders Germany were given a helping hand by arch-rivals the Netherlands who held Northern Ireland 0-0 away to ensure the Dutch and Germans qualified with one match to spare.</p>
      <p>Germany have 18 points -- from six draws and one defeat - while the Dutch have 16 and Northern Ireland 14.</p>
      <p>Belarus have four points but could still qualify as they have reached the playoffs of the Nations League which offers four more places.</p>
      <p>"I'm satisfied, there were some very good passing exchanges," said coach Joachim Loew, who took over in 2006 and will be in charge at his seventh major tournament.</p>
      <p>"We did a good job. All in all, I'm very satisfied. Kroos is extremely important for the team, he's always ready to play, always keeps his cool - he's elementary for such a young team. He does that very well."</p>
      <p>As expected, Germany quickly took control although their early attacks were somewhat predictable.</p>
      <p>They were given a fright when Stasevich's dipping long-range shot forced Neuer into a difficult save and they went ahead shortly afterwards.</p>
      <p>Serge Gnabry wriggled past his marker and fired a low ball across the face of goal which was flicked in by Ginter for his first Germany goal on his 29th appearance.</p>
      <p>Germany increased their lead four minutes after halftime when Kroos sent a low corner to the edge of the area, Ginter dummied and Goretzka fired home.</p>
      <p>Six minutes later, Ginter's pass found Kroos on the edge of the area and he swept the ball home with a trademark first-time shot.</p>
      <p>Belarus were awarded a penalty when Robin Koch tripped Pavel Nekhaychik but Neuer dived to his right to save Stasevich's spot-kick. Kroos rubbed it in when he collected the ball in the area, spun past his mark, evaded another and fired a low shot past Aleksandr Gutor to complete the rout.</p>
