      <p>Harden stood up in the absence of the resting Russell Westbrook to carve apart the Timberwolves, his 41 attempts coming in as the most in the league so far this season.</p>
      <p>Harden scored from 16 of those attempts, making eight from 22 from three-point range, while Karl-Anthony Towns had 27 points for Minnesota.</p>
