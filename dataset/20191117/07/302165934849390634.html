      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 17 — Paul George scored 37 points in only 20 minutes, leading the Los Angeles Clippers to a 150-101 victory over the visiting Atlanta Hawks last night despite playing without Kawhi Leonard.</p>
      <p>George, who scored 25 points in the first half, converted 10 of 17 shots from the floor overall, including 6 of 11 3-pointers. He made all 11 of his free throws. George, who scored 33 points in his season debut Thursday in a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans, is 21 of 21 from the line in two games.</p>
      <p>Lou Williams, who made 15 of 15 free throws, had 25 points off the bench for the Clippers, who snapped a two-game losing streak. Jerome Robinson contributed 21 points, and Montrezl Harrell had 17, helping the Clippers’ bench outscore the Hawks’ reserves 81-35.</p>
      <p>Trae Young led the Hawks with 20 points to go along with six assists. Young, though, hit just 4 of 16 shots from the floor. De’Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish each had 12 points, and Jabari Parker, Damian Jones and Evan Turner chipped in 11 apiece for Atlanta.</p>
      <p>Leonard sat out the game with a knee contusion, the second consecutive contest the Clippers’ star forward has missed. Clippers guard Patrick Beverley also missed his second straight contest with a sore left calf, while guard Landry Shamet was unavailable because of an ankle injury.</p>
      <p>The Clippers never trailed. After leading by 12 at the half, they blew the game open in the third quarter by outscoring the Hawks 38-20 for a 112-82 lead entering the fourth. The lead maxed out at 52.</p>
      <p>The Clippers led by as much as 17 in the first quarter before the Hawks rallied in the second. They cut the gap to 51-47 midway through the second quarter after a bucket by Parker.</p>
      <p>However, the Clippers answered with a 15-2 surge after a three-point play by rookie guard Terance Mann, who got his first NBA start, at 3:57 for a 66-49 advantage. Mann finished with 13 points, eight assists and six rebounds.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles led 74-62 at the break.</p>
