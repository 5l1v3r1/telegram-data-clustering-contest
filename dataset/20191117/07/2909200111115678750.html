      <p>Controversial security analyst Alhaji Irbard Ibrahim, has accused political actors of not sticking to the substance of the 2020 budget but rather focusing their attention on the minor issue of a typographical error on the number of farmers who have benefited from government provision of fertilizer.</p>
      <p>Even though he failed to name the political actors, it is clear that his criticism is on National Democratic Congress (NDC) activists who have taken the Finance Minister and the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) over the error.</p>
      <p>On his part, it is surprising “that a single typographical error of the number of farmers has become the central theme of post-budget reading discussion.”</p>
      <p>His advice to them is that they provide Ghanaians with a more “intellectual diagnosis of the budget”.</p>
      <p>“I am surprised that a single typographical error of the number of farmers has become the central theme of a post-budget reading discussion. I humbly urge political actors to stick to substance and not major in minors. Ghanaians deserve a more intellectual diagnosis of the budget!” He wrote on social media.</p>
      <p>The Finance Minister presented the 2020 Budget to Parliament yesterday with an error on the number of farmers who have benefited from government supply of fertilizers. The figure in the budget statement is 880,000 million farmers. This error has attracted attention of mainly opposition NDC members who have chastised the government for the error, accusing it of cooking the figures.</p>
