      <h1>Denny Hamlin, Joe Gibbs have shared highs and lows together</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:34:47+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:34</time> by <a rel="author">NASCAR Wire Service</a></address>
      <p>HOMESTEAD, Fla. — Speedweeks at Daytona this year were an apt microcosm of Denny Hamlin’s career.</p>
      <p>During practice for the Daytona 500, Hamlin decided to draft with a pack of cars — despite strict team orders not to do so.</p>
      <p>The inevitable happened.</p>
      <p>
        <b>NASCAR AT HOMESTEAD: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nascar/news/nascar-at-homestead-starting-lineup-ecoboost-400-championship-4/c6kqrphywo51o5bblp4nfilz">Starting lineup for the Ford EcoBoost 400</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>"Basically, we had a practice plan, and I felt like I needed to get in the pack and draft,"Hamlin said. "As soon as I made my way to the back of the pack, someone wrecked and I got in it. They were furious, to say the least, absolutely furious."</p>
      <p>Team owner Joe Gibbs read Hamlin the riot act.</p>
      <p>"He's like, 'You're going to pay for that car,'" Hamlin said.</p>
      <p>Hamlin found an antidote for his team owner’s wrath.</p>
      <p>"Luckily, I won the Daytona 500,"said Hamlin, who described Gibbs’ response as: "'Don't worry about that. Sorry I got so mad at you. It's fine.'"</p>
      <p>Reminded of the incident Friday morning at Homestead-Miami Speedway, site of the season- and playoff-ending Ford EcoBoost 400 (3:30 p.m., NBC, MRN, SiriusXMNASCARRadio), Gibbs laughed.</p>
      <p>"I was upset with what happened," he said, "and then he turned around and won that next race, and I said, 'OK, you can forget that.' I don't think I've ever penalized anybody for anything, but I threaten them every now and then."</p>

      </p>
      <p>That Daytona 500 win, Hamlin’s second in the Great American Race, signaled the start of a remarkable turnaround for the 38-year-old Virginia driver.</p>
      <p>Winless in 2018, Hamlin has visited Victory Lane six times this year. Last week at ISM Raceway in Phoenix, his win in the Bluegreen Vacations 500 wiped out a mistake of his own making at Texas — a solo spin off Turn4 — that looked to have ended Hamlin’s Playoff run.</p>
      <p>Like the mistake and recovery at Daytona, the last two races in the Round of 8 are emblematic of the volatility of Hamlin’s career. Teaming with crew chief Chris Gabehart for the first time this season has helped smooth out some of the extremes.</p>
      <p>"If you go through a whole year like he did last year and not win a race and you get everybody kind of . . . the rumors start: 'Is this guy over the hill?'"Gibbs said. "I think Denny was fighting through that, saying that's not the case. But I think the fact that Chris came on board, and I think Chris really helped, because Chris has a different outlook on things.</p>
      <p>"And then I think Denny getting off to the start the way he did winning that Daytona 500, I think that we all know that people mature and grow up. Different things happen in their life. So I think Denny is . . . I think he's in a part in his life where he says I get a second chance, reallyin a lot of ways, and he's making the most of it. And I think certainly Gabehart has really, really helped him with that."</p>
      <p>Gibbs has three drivers in the Championship 4— Kyle Busch and Martin Truex Jr. along with polesitter Hamlin — but Hamlin is the only one without a Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series championship.</p>
      <p>That could change Sunday, and that’s a pinnacle the driver of the No. 11 Toyota would be happy to ascend.</p>
