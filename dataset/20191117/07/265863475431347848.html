      <p>Lisa Rinna is as proud as possible when it comes to her daughters and their already pretty successful careers. As you may know, Amelia and Delilah are already a pretty big deal in the modeling industry and only getting bigger!</p>
      <p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills celeb’s daughters that she shares with husband Harry Hamlin are 18 and 21 years old, respectively but the reality TV show’s fans have been able to literally watch them grow up on their small screens.</p>
      <p>Now, both Amelia and Delilah are putting a lot of effort into making it into the modeling industry, with a little bit of help from their mom.</p>
      <p>While at the first edition of BravoCon, Lisa told HollywoodLife that she’s made sure to teach them some very important lessons they can use at work and in their day-to-day lives in general.</p>
      <p>‘First and foremost, Harry and I made sure that they know that the most important thing is to be kind to absolutely everyone. It is to be kind and work hard and be kind,’ the proud mother shared with the news outlet.</p>
      <p>She went on to add that ‘They are learning [about building their brand] as they go along and I think that they have watched me, they have watched Harry. And again, it is something you acquire as you go along. It is not something you just get overnight. And they’re working really hard at it and they are figuring out what works, what does not work. It is probably the best schooling you could have – just to have your own brand and learn from the bottom, just from the ground up. I am thrilled for them.’</p>
