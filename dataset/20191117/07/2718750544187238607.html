      <p>Dramatic musical stings and plenty of fainting abound in <i>Saturday Night Live</i>’s take on the recent <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/11/yovanovitch-led-by-example-in-her-impeachment-testimony.html">Trump impeachment hearings,</a> which brought a welcome dose of excitement to the <a href="https://t.co/1UfkaeZ3I4?amp=1">unexpectedly bleary</a> C-Span affair in a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/entire-days-of-our-lives-cast-released-from-their-contracts.html"><i>Days of Our Lives</i></a><i> </i>riff. The cold open saw Alex Moffat donning a bald cap to play Rep. Adam Schiff and Cecily Strong in a cheeky foulard as former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, as well as <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/john-mulaney-dishes-on-when-jon-hamm-saw-the-snl-staff-drunk.html">always welcome guest star Jon Hamm</a> as Bill Taylor. Mikey Day also joined as a squeaky-voiced Jim Jordan, along with Kate McKinnon, who was truly scary as a slimy Rudy Giuliani. We would include more of the surprise appearances, but that, of course, would be a spoiler, which is the cardinal sin of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2015/10/primetime-soap-operas-are-back.html">soap operas</a>. Watch for yourself and try to refrain from fainting.</p>
