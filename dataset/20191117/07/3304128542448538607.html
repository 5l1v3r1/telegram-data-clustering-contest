      <p>Gor Mahia rallied to hold Al Hilal SC 1-1 in an international friendly played on Saturday at Martyrs of Benina Stadium, Benina Benghazi east of Libya.</p>
      <p>The match was symbolic as the club sought to prove to FIFA, the world’s football body, and indeed the entire world that Libya is safe and ready for international football.</p>
      <p>A huge banner written “Libya is a country of peace and good” was boldly mounted on the stands, a clear message of intent.</p>

      <p>For close to a decade now since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi regime, Libya has been under FIFA ban and cannot host international games over insecurity.</p>

      <p>Sectarian violence, which broke out in 2014 worsened the situation and led to suspension of the domestic league in April this year with clubs from Tripoli bemoaning increased violence.</p>
      <p>Things are relatively better now especially in the east of the country where the game against Gor Mahia was staged.</p>

      <p>The success of the meet especially in regards security, is a big plus to Hilal and authorities, who have been using sports to prove that Libya is safe.</p>
      <p>At the end of the game the message was clear and loud, “lift the ban on Libyan stadiums.”</p>
