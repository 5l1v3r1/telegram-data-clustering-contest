      <p>Rajkummar also revealed that the scripting process is in progress but the makers had hit a roadblock when they realized that the title Chupke Chupke is taken by Manish Goswami for his production house long ago. However, it is now reported that Manish has parted with the title for the remake. According to reports in Mumbai Mirror report, Bhushan Kumar’s company approached Manish Goswami to acquire the right of the titled and he promptly did so. Manish published a ‘No Objection’ letter to the Film and Television Producers Guild of India for the title. The report suggests that he did so as he didn’t have a suitable script ready.</p>
      <p>Manish was quoted saying, “We’re industry colleagues, so, we should help one another in times of need.” The same reports suggested that Manish had earlier given the title Dream Girl to Ekta Kapoor for her Ayushmann Khurrana and Nushrat Bharucha starrer.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, talking about Rajkummar’s other projects, he has Hansal Mehta’s <i>Turram Khan</i> and Anurag Basu’s yet-untitled film which also stars Abhishek Bachchan, Aditya Roy Kapur, Fatima Sana Shaikh, and Sanya Malhotra. He will also be seen in <i>Stree 2</i> alongside Shraddha Kapoor, Pankaj Tripathi, and Aparshakti Khurana.</p>
