      </p>
      <p>Persons suspected to be thugs invaded a polling unit in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, carting away voting materials.</p>
      <p>The thugs invaded the PU 020, Ward 05, Etegwe Primary School, Yenagoa, at about 4:21 pm on Saturday after voting had been concluded.</p>
      <p>Our Correspondent who witnessed the violent invasion reports that the thugs, about 20 in number, came with assorted dangerous weapons and chased away the corps members working as ad hoc staff of INEC.</p>
      <p>They, thereafter, carted away thumb-printed ballot papers and boxes and escaped through the rear of the unfenced Etegwe Primary school.</p>
      <p>Many of the voters also fled the polling unit for fear of being harmed by the rampaging thugs.</p>
      <p>Electoral observers and INEC officials also fled the venue.</p>
