      <p>Doja Cat turned up the fierceness on her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fashionnova/?hl=en">Instagram</a> page on Friday when she posted a photo of herself in a leopard print bodysuit that shows of her hourglass figure. The “Rules” rapper paired the outfit with a long blonde wig, a pair of yellow oversized statement sunglasses and what appears to be scarf until you read the post’s caption. In it, she revealed that how beguilingly creative her headwear actually is.</p>
      <p>“@fashionnova got cute leopard bodysuits but I used one as a scarf to match this jumpsuit because WE’RE INNOVATORS,” the “Juicy” rapper wrote in the caption. “Suck on that.”</p>
      <p>Although recommended Fashion Nova’s bodysuits, Doja Cat did not share the name of the design she’s wearing. A search of the website didn’t turn up any clothing that looks the same as the bodysuit Doja has on in her most recent Instagram post.</p>
      <p>As of writing, the photo has attracted more than 150,000 likes and over 850 comments.</p>
      <p>In the comments section, fans shared their appreciation for Doja’s <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/fashion">fashion</a> choices.</p>
      <p>Quite a few of her fans applauded the creativity of her headwear.</p>
      <p>“We love a fashion designer,” one fan wrote.</p>
      <p>Others expressed admiration for the entire ensemble.</p>
      <p>“Love love love your outfit,” another added.</p>
      <p>The image even inspired more than one proposal.</p>
      <p>“Doja please marry me,” the fan wrote. “I’ll do anything.”</p>
      <p>“Serious question….can we get married for like a day?” the commenter asked. “Is that asking for too much?”</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first time that Doja has worn an animal print outfit in a photo on her Instagram page. In a post she created in October she’s wearing<a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5711455/doja-cat-snakeskin-bikini-rules-music-video/"> a snakeskin print bikini</a> with a cowboy hat and dark sunglasses. The two-piece outfit has a unique garter belt attached to it and there’s a matching strap wrapped around her torso which emphasizes her hourglass figure. She wears a version of this outfit in the video for “Rules,” one of the lead singles off of her recently released album <i>Hot Pink.</i></p>

      <p>Doja appears to truly have a thing for animal print since she also wore a pink leopard print bikini top in a photo series she uploaded on September 19. Doja appears to have tied the top’s straps around her waist and in one photo she paired it with a maxi skirt in the same color and print. The series currently has close to 500,000 likes on Instagram and more than 3,5000 people have commented on it.</p>
