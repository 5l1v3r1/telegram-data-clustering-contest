      <p>To say I was nervous was an understatement, I even got my friend to drive me around the block a couple of times because I just wanted to make sure he showed up.</p>
      <p>My last relationship was when I was 17 for around two years. I got my heart smashed to smithereens, which kind of put a dampener on relationships in general for a while.</p>
      <p>But Aidan was lovely from the get-go, he’s really handsome and definitely my type. I found out he was a few years older, which was nice because I do tend to go for older guys based on a lack of maturity in previous partners.</p>
      <p>I really prefer doing activity-based dates, especially for a first date because it’s a way of breaking the ice and better than being stuck at a table for two hours just talking. Our conversation mostly flowed throughout the date and playing mini golf was great because if I ever got stuck for what to say, I just made a joke about the insane setups they have there.</p>
      <blockquote>I would be happy to see him again to figure out if that spark is there.</blockquote>
      <p>My only worry is it was clear Aidan has the travel bug, which is wonderful, don’t get me wrong, but I’m looking for someone that hopefully sticks around for a bit because I’ve got a year left of my marketing and PR degree to go.</p>
      <p>After the mini golf we went to Northbridge Brewing Company across the road and had a drink there and walked through the city before we said goodbye. I didn’t know if he was interested in me romantically, or just as a mate as he was a little hard to read. I would be happy to see him again to figure out if that spark is there.</p>
      <p>We added each other on Facebook and overall I had a great time.</p>
      <p>It pushed me outside of my comfort zone and I feel like now I have the confidence to go on tonnes of dates.</p>
      <p>
        <b>VERDICT: 9/10</b>

      <p>AIDAN, 26 SAYS:</p>
      <p>Coming in to the date I didn’t have much time to think about it, I ended up moving house the morning after the date. I only recently moved back to Perth as I’ve been living in Norway for three years and spent a year travelling back to Australia.</p>
      <p>I was pretty excited, a bit anxious too but in a good way. I think it would be weird if you weren’t.</p>
      <p>On meeting Laura she was pretty bubbly and you can tell she was a bit nervous when we first got there. I have to admit she wasn’t really my type, she was a bit younger than I would usually date.</p>
      <p>My last girlfriend was Norwegian and that didn’t end up working out but I stayed after that ended, so I have travelled a fair bit. Laura was really nice but still in university so we didn’t have too much in common.</p>
      <p>I’m not really a gym junkie but I love hiking and the outdoors so looking for someone more similar, outdoorsy and adventurous in that sense.</p>
      <p>It was still a lovely day, there was constant conversation and questions. It was the first time I had been on a blind date so it was a fun experience in that sense and it’s nice not knowing anything and you can ask any question and you can get a new answer you don’t know anything about.</p>
      <blockquote>I’d definitely do it again because it was a good experience.</blockquote>
      <p>Usually before a date you’ve checked them out on Instagram or something before so you know a little bit of back story about them. I’d definitely do it again because it was a good experience.</p>
      <p>Also Holey Moley is great first date place, you can interact and have a good conversation but you’re not just looking directly at eachother. We played nine holes, then had a break and a drink and a chat and it was great that the ice was already broken.</p>
      <p>Another date? It was a really nice day but unfortunately I don’t think I’ll be having another one.</p>
      <p><b>VERDICT:</b> 8/10</p>
      <p>
