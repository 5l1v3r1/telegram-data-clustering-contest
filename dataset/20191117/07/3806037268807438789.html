      <p>Little will question <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/marshall">Marshall</a>‘s pedigree in creating high-performing audio equipment, and now the brand has taken its expertise from the past six decades to create a truly portable Bluetooth speaker for the road.</p>
      <p>Dubbed the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/marshall-kilburn">Kilburn 2</a>, Marshall’s latest creation provides room-filling sound via two tweeters constructed from 8 Watt Class D amps along with a booming woofer using a 20 Watt Class D amp. As with the rest of its speakers and amplifiers, atop the box are volume, bass, and treble adjustment knobs so you can tune your music according to your preferences. Connection-wise, the Kilburn 2 is equipped with Bluetooth 5.0 and aptX, allowing for high fidelity sound quality. It holds a battery life of more than 20 hours, and can even hold a play time of three hours from just a 20-minute charge. As a bonus for those out and about, the portable speaker is also IPX2 water resistant, and comes with a handy carry strap.</p>
      <p>Available in both black or white, the Marshall Kilburn 2 portable Bluetooth speaker is now available over at the <a href="https://www.marshallheadphones.com/us/en/kilburn-ii.html">company’s website</a> for $300 USD. Head over to grab yours now.</p>
      <p>For more things tech-related, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-returns-keyboard-to-scissor-switch">the new 16-inch MacBook Pro has apparently reverted back to the scissor-switch keyboard of the older models</a>.</p>
