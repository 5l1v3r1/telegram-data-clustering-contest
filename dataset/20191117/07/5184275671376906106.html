      <p>Kapil Sharma is famous for making people laugh. His show – <i>The Kapil Sharma Show</i> – is one of the most-watched talks shows as he gets candid with Bollywood stars on the show and talks about everything and anything to them. In the latest episode, Kapil invited <i>Pagalpanti</i> cast – Anil Kapoor, Urvashi Rautela, Arshad Warsi and John Abraham on the show. Archana Puran Singh, as usual, sat on the hot seat to welcome the guests.</p>
      <p>The conversation had to be hilarious as it was the cast of <i>Pagalpanti</i> sitting with Kapil. Anil Kapoor, Urvashi Rautela, Arshad Warsi and John Abraham talked about their film and enjoyed a fun banter with Kapil. But what made it to the highlights was Kapil talking about how Anil Kapoor manages to look so young at his age.</p>

      <p>Kapil begins by telling that Anil Kapoor wakes up at 4 and that is the very secret to his fit look. He did not miss this chance to mock Archana and said that she too wakes up at 4 and that is why she looks so radiant as well. The only difference is that Archana wakes up to dye her hair black. Listening to this revelation, all of them burst into laughter.</p>
