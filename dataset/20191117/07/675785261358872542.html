      <h1>Chris Kamara got no Christmas presents as kid despite it falling on his birthday</h1>
      <h2>Sky Sports pundit and football legend Chris 'Kammy' Kamara reveals he was also told he couldn't play football because he was black - as he launches singing career with new album Here's To Christmas</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Adam Beresford</a></address>
      <p>He’s well known as an excitable football pundit and a presenter on Ninja Warrior UK, yet when we meet <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chris-kamara">Chris Kamara</a> – aka Kammy – he is a much quieter presence than expected.</p>
      <p>Trim and dapper in a dark blue three-piece suit, he’s just as friendly as on telly but also thoughtful, and he lacks the huge ego that many ex-footballers have.</p>
      <p>And we soon learn he’s used his talents, determination and strong work ethic to overcome a life of poverty and prejudice.</p>
      <p>When asked about his childhood, he says, ‘It was a nightmare. We weren’t very rich anyway, we were a poor family, the first black family on our estate and we didn’t have a lot of money.’</p>
      <p>His birthday, which falls on Christmas Day, is a particularly memorable event for Chris, and not for good reasons.</p>
      <p>‘Just to get a Christmas present was something else. To get a birthday present at the same time never happened. I got one or the other if I was lucky.’</p>

      <p>Surprisingly, things didn’t improve when Chris was an adult and earning his own money.</p>
      <p>‘The first time I was able to celebrate my birthday, would you believe, was when I was 35,’ he marvels.</p>
      <p>‘Because I was a professional footballer for all those years, every single year we had a game on Boxing Day. So I never had a drink on my birthday – I was either at home not drinking, or in a hotel with the team.’</p>
      <p>Happily, Christmas 2019 will provide Chris, 61, his wife Anne and grown-up sons Ben and Jack with an extra-special reason to celebrate. Chris has fulfilled a lifelong dream of releasing an album.</p>

        <figcaption>Chris as a baby: He had a tough upbringing</figcaption>

      <p>His debut, <i>Here’s To Christmas</i> , sees the fan of Big Band and Swing music crooning festive favourites. From <i>Frosty The Snowman</i> to <i>Walking In A Winter Wonderland</i> , it’s a toe-tapping set list which perfectly showcases Kammy’s soulful voice.</p>
      <p>His first recording session at London’s Angel Recording Studios was nerve-wracking, he reveals.</p>
      <p>‘It was frightening, but the big band are so good, I kept getting told off by the conductor because I was too busy listening instead of waiting for my cue,’ he laughs.</p>
      <p>‘When you get the opportunity to work with these guys and see how dedicated they are, it’s so incredible. Even if anybody doesn’t like the singing on the album, just listen to the music, it’s quite amazing.’</p>

      <p>Although the album features nine classic covers, the title track is an original song which was written specially for Chris. Featuring bells, piano, saxophone and lyrics about log fires, it’s a Yuletide treat.</p>
      <p>‘It’s written by Richard Scott, who writes for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/robbie-williams">Robbie Williams</a> , and it sounds like a song that’s been around for years and years,’ says Chris.</p>
      <p>‘Everybody I play it to says, “Who sang that before?” and I go, “No, no one sang it before, it’s totally original.”’</p>
      <p>All of this showbiz hoopla is a long way from Chris’s humble beginnings in Middlesbrough. Born to an English mother and a father from Sierra Leone, at age 16 he was forced to join the Navy.</p>

      <p>‘My dad marched me down to the crewman and made me sign on the dotted line,’ he reveals.</p>
      <p>‘He’d done it to my brother, who was in the Army, and he did it to me. I had the opportunity to become an apprentice footballer at Middlesbrough, which was the dream, but he wouldn’t let me. Can you imagine doing that to your own kids today? It just wouldn’t happen. I didn’t do it to mine, I was really relaxed, let them do what they want to do.’</p>
      <p>A teenage Chris was not willing to give up on his dream, so while on a six-month trial with the Navy, he asked the Navy football coach if he could play with the team. But he was met with the kind of bigotry that was rife in Britain during the early 1970s.</p>
      <p>‘He said, “No, there’s three things against you – one, you’re black and this lot will kick lumps out of you because of your colour. Two, you’re only on a six-month trial period, so I can’t draft you into the Navy football team. And three, you’re too skinny, you’re not strong enough as a man.”’</p>

      <p>But Chris showed the kind of self-belief that would stand him in good stead during his subsequent professional football career, where he played for teams including Leeds and Middlesbrough.</p>
      <p>‘They eventually gave me a game and I proved him wrong on all three counts. But to be honest I didn’t have to prove him wrong, I just had to play and he said, “We’ll break the rules and draft you in.” Which they did,’ he smiles.</p>
      <p>Chris has battled the scourge of racism in football for many years. He’s worked with the organisation Show Racism The Red Card for over two decades, and has been inducted into its hall of fame.</p>
      <p>‘Racism will never completely go away, but when I was growing up and playing football it was just totally different to what it is today,’ he muses.</p>
      <p>‘60% of the people in the whole of the country were racist, and for players to go through what the likes of myself, Viv Anderson, Luther Blissett and John Barnes went through, in this day and age it would just not be acceptable.</p>

      <p>‘It’s still there but it’s nowhere near as bad. Every time there was a robbery or if a house was just broken into, all the people on the estate would say it was my dad, so the police would come and arrest him.</p>
      <p>‘Since I started working in TV people don’t even see my colour any more, they see Kammy, you know?’</p>
      <p>Although Chris has enjoyed a long post-football career as a coach, commentator and popular broadcaster, in recent years he opened up about drinking too much due to boredom while away from home.</p>
      <p>He became a Drink Aware ambassador and has since dramatically reduced his alcohol intake.</p>
      <p>‘When you’re staying in hotels four or five times a week, you think, “I can’t just go to the room, I’ll drive myself mad,”’ he says.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Chris credits his wife Anne for helping him rein in his drinking</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Chris credits Anne with putting things into perspective for him when it came to hotel bars.</p>
      <p>‘She said, “What’s the difference between being sat at home here watching television or being in the hotel?”</p>
      <p>I said, “Well, I’m on my own,” but she said, “If I’m not here you sit in the house on your own."</p>
      <p>"So that was a lightbulb moment,’ he chuckles.</p>
      <p>‘I’m an occasional drinker now. You just become more aware of what you’re doing to your health and when you get grandkids you want to live for as long as you can. I feel amazing, I can enjoy myself when I want and look after myself when I need to.’</p>
      <p>Chris and Anne are creatures of habit when he is at home – but there is one thing they don’t agree on.</p>
      <p>‘We have two rooms for TV – one where I go and watch the football and one where Anne watches the other telly,’ says Chris.</p>
      <p>‘Then we go to bed and watch <i>Coronation Street</i> together, but I do watch <i>Emmerdale</i> as well. I’ve always been a fan, and I got the chance to appear in it this year,’ he beams.</p>
      <p>After some tough beginnings, life has turned out pretty well for Kammy. And we hope he gets everything he wants for Christmas.</p>
      <h3>HOW DO YOU SPEND YOUR SUNDAYS?</h3>
      <h4>■ What’s your Sunday routine?</h4>
      <p>There is no set routine because I’m travelling up and down away from home probably more than I should be. But if you get the opportunity to do these things then I do it. Why turn it down? I’d look back in 10 years when I’m not doing anything and think why didn’t I do that?</p>
      <h4>■ You don’t get much downtime then?</h4>
      <p>Well, my weekends are taken care of with presenting, it’s as simple as that. Forty Saturdays a year I’m at a football match and on the Sunday I’m in a studio presenting Goals On Sunday.</p>
      <p>I’ve been doing football at the weekend since I was 16. I think my wife thought that in 1998 when I got the sack from Stoke City that that would be it, I’d return to normal family life. But that’s when I took up with Sky and things have stayed exactly the same.</p>

      <h4>■ What do you do on those precious 12 weekends a year when you’re not committed to football?</h4>
      <p>We’re massive animal lovers, so every other year we go on safari. We’ve decided we will always go to Kenya as we love cats. We went to Richard Branson’s place, Mahali Mzuri, where they were in abundance.</p>
