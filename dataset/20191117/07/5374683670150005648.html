      <p>The party leaders of the right wing bloc will hold an emergency meeting this morning (Sunday) at 11:45 at the Prime Minister's office. In addition a Likud convention will take place at Tel Aviv Expo this evening at 18:00.</p>
      <p>The PM will update the meeting that he has heard reports that Benny Gantz is to declare on Monday a minority government supported by the Ararb Parties.</p>
      <p>In closed talk Netanyahu said "this is an emergency that we have never seen before. New elections are a disaster but a government supported by the Arab parties is a bigger disaster. This is a danger to the State of Israel and and damaging to Israel's security. This move must be stopped in any way, even from the opposition."</p>
      <p><i>Channel 11 News </i>reported that the number 3 in the Blue and White Party, Moshe Ya'alon, told Benny Gantz that he would support a minority government if Liberman would be included.</p>
