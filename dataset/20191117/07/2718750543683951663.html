      <p>Harry Styles <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-x3uD5z1bQ">gave us the gift</a> of a sweet summer pop song in the dead of winter, and the cognitive dissonance of listening to lyrics about “strawberries on a summer evening” in the middle of November is weirdly thrilling. Styles released the song on streaming platforms right around the time <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/snl-harry-styles-to-host-november.html">he performed it</a> on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, in his final musical performance of the night. This is Styles’s second single from <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/harry-styles-new-album-rolling-stone-interview.html"><i>Fine Line</i></a>, his upcoming sophomore album set to drop on December 13 (which just happens to be, <i>ahem</i>, the birthday of a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/hear-taylor-swifts-new-cats-song-beautiful-ghosts.html">certain ex</a> of his). His first single from <i>Fine Line </i>was <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/harry-styles-is-all-kinds-of-shirtless-in-lights-up-video.html">“Lights Up,”</a> released back in <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/harry-styles-lights-up-song-review.html">October</a>, which he performed for the first time live also on <i>SNL </i>tonight. We welcome you to give “Watermelon Sugar” a listen, drown your winter worries in its coy, sickly sweet guitar hook, and mark your calendars for December 13.</p>
