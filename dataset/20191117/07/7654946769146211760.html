      <h1>Eagles will test Patriots ‘next-game’ mentality in Super Bowl rematch</h1>

      <p>There are some fascinating numbers to crunch and consider when analyzing Sunday’s Super Bowl LII rematch between the 8-1 Patriots and 5-4 Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field.</p>
      <p>The Patriots are coming off a bye week, and under coach Bill Belichick they are 14-5 following a week off. They were blasted by the Ravens in their previous game, 37-20, and since 2002, the Patriots are 44-8 in regular-season games following a loss.</p>
      <p>New England is just two seasons removed from losing the 41-33 Super Bowl LII thriller to the Eagles in Minneapolis. So, revenge? Maybe.</p>
      <p>The Patriots have allowed just three touchdown passes this season and they have 19 interceptions. Ball security has been a forte of Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz, who’s throw just four INTs and lost two fumbles.</p>
      <p>The Patriots, before their loss to the Ravens, had been a force this season en route to winning their first eight games. The question is what kind of damage that loss to the Ravens did, and if it will have any lingering effects.</p>

      <p>The Patriots are most vulnerable at the moment on their offensive line. They will be without starting center David Andrews, who has a blood clot in his lung, and left tackle Isaiah Wynn, who’s on IR with a toe injury.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Eagles’ pass rush has been improving — led by Fletcher Cox, Derek Barnett, Josh Sweat and Brandon Graham, one of Philadelphia’s Super Bowl heroes.</p>
      <p>Following that Super Bowl surprise, serious questions were being asked of Belichick about why he benched Malcolm Butler, the team’s top cornerback, for the game. To date, Belichick has never answered those questions. Butler no longer is with the Patriots, instead now in Tennessee.</p>
      <p>The Patriots rebounded from that loss, winning the Super Bowl last February.</p>
      <p>“There were conversations that were had the beginning of that offseason, about trying to find a way to pick ourselves up and continue on, to maintain belief in one another, to maintain belief in our process,” Patriots veteran captain Matthew Slater said of the healing process, according to ESPN.com. “There is a time to be upset when you lose a game like that. And there is a time to heal and grow and move on. We did that at the beginning of the offseason. We said, ‘Hey, all right, that’s it, we can’t let it affect us moving forward. This is a new year. This is a new team. We have to pick ourselves up off the canvas.’ ’’</p>
      <p>One of Belichick’s strengths always has been the “next-game’’ mentality he drills into his players, best exemplified by, “On to Cincinnati.’’</p>
      <p>That was a part of helping the Patriots get over that Super Bowl loss to the Eagles.</p>
      <p>“Each year is a new year, and each of our performances from year to year is contingent on our preparation and ability to perform in that season that we’re being judged in, not what we did in some other years,” Belichick told reporters during the week. “Personally, I don’t really put a lot of weight or a whole lot of evaluation into what’s happened in the past. I try to focus more on the present, and how that can be improved and accelerated to work to a higher level. That’s really what’s it’s about for me.”</p>
