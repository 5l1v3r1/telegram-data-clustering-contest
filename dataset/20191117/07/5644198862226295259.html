      <h1>Commentary: The wild world of pre-wedding photoshoots</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:49:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:49</time> by <a rel="author">Terence Heng</a></address>
      <p>A bridal photoshoot at a cemetery in Kluang, Malaysia has sparked debate about whether a line was crossed in that chase towards the most interesting wedding photography locations. Terence Heng deconstructs why we do that.</p>
      <p>LIVERPOOL: Those of you who have read previous commentaries I have penned for CNA will know that much of what I say is based on my research in two areas – wedding rituals, and death and spirituality.</p>
      <p>So when I read news about how bridal photographs were being taken in a cemetery in Kluang, Malaysia (hence stirring up controversy), I figured I must have hit some kind of sociological, analytical jackpot.</p>

        <b>NOT SO DIFFERENT</b>
      </p>
      <p>To be clear, in no way am I advocating that you do the same or that you should make light of what sensitivities were ignored in that attempt to get a unique bridal shot. Feelings were hurt, the bridal shop owner herself has come out to issue an apology video, and forgiveness was given.</p>
      <p>But the news surely gives us pause for reflection. After all, weddings and death are not all that dissimilar – they are both rites of passage and as such demand commemoration, celebration, commiseration, or a combination of the three.</p>
      <p>Although weddings evoke ideas of new beginnings, more often than not, they are also an opportunity for remembrance – honouring family members both present and absent in speeches and rituals alike.</p>
      <p>But that’s another topic for another commentary.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THIS OBSESSION WITH PRE-WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHIES</b>
      </p>
      <p>Although the news was about a bridal shop photoshoot, it reminded me of the lengths we go to for weddings, particularly pre-wedding photoshoots, or sometimes also known as engagement photography.</p>
      <p>For the uninitiated, these are the kinds of photos taken before one gets married to display on huge screens during the wedding dinner.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This type of wedding photography has grown significantly in popularity over the last 20 years. Where couples used to pose for a few images in a studio, on-location pre-wedding photography has become a global phenomenon.</p>
      <p>What used to be an hour or two spent indoors looking lovingly at each other (or the photographer) has been replaced by day-long shoots in exotic and increasingly outlandish locations.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>If the 1990s in Singapore saw photoshoots at the Chinese and Japanese gardens, or <i>that </i>tree nook on Sentosa Island, today we see a reflection of globalisation and increasing GDP per capita in The Eiffel Tower, glaciers in New Zealand, Las Vegas or “Winter Sonata” Korea.</p>
      <p>Nothing is safe from bride/groom/photographer-zilla.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A PERFORMANCE</b>
      </p>
      <p>This should not be surprising to anyone who has had to go through a wedding. Weddings are intensely consumptive and performative events, as I pointed out in a <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/commentary-getting-married-in-an-era-of-consumerism-8991608">previous commentary</a> about people overspending on nuptials.</p>
      <p>They are an opportunity to display all kinds of capital – economic, social and cultural – how much money one has, what social connections one possesses, or what levels of taste one can invoke. All these are all fair game in a wedding.</p>
      <p>To extend that performance in pre-wedding photography is only logical.</p>
      <p>The act of travelling overseas to have your photographs taken satisfies a number of performances – it shows that one can afford to travel overseas, and that one is “cosmopolitan”, even if neither of these were the conscious intention of the individuals involved.</p>

      <p>But with cheaper airfare, and even cheaper photography packages in some places like Taiwan and Malaysia, couples must increasingly find other ways to differentiate themselves.</p>
      <p>It is not enough to pose in front of a famous landmark, because there are probably 16 other couples doing exactly the same thing there.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Instead, photographs must continuously be “something else” – a unique or at least a differentiating aesthetic.</p>
      <p>To paraphrase Thorstein Veblen’s notions of conspicuous consumption – when one sets the trend, and others emulate that trend, then one is no longer a trend-setter, and must find new trends.</p>
      <p>
        <b>AN ARMS RACE</b>
      </p>
      <p>What we then have is an arms race of performed uniqueness, an ever-escalating series of actions that attempt to make one wedding different from another. (But to be honest, if you have photographed as many weddings as I have, they do tend to begin to look the same, no thanks to increasing commercialisation.)</p>
      <p>This arms race manifests itself all around the world. Goaded on by social media and the wedding industry, couples spend both money and time trying to create a unique selling point in their wedding.</p>

      <p>So yes, you can have a zombie-themed wedding if you want. More brains for you sir?</p>
      <p>Let’s be fair – there is nothing wrong with making your special day different in whichever way you want.</p>
      <p>But the advice I used to give to couples (as the obnoxious know-it-all photographer) was always this – do the things and go to the places that have meaning and history to you. So when you show others the photographs of those things and places, there’s a story to tell, a connection to be made.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A STORY, A MEMORY</b>
      </p>
      <p>More than a decade ago, I photographed a Singaporean couple who had spent a number of years working in London. We went all around the city, and finished the shoot at a pub. Over dinner, the groom made mention that their old home was just down the street.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>It was nothing special, but it was certainly something memorable. “Come on, let’s go!” I roared, ignoring the bemused looks from my client-friends.</p>
      <p>We strolled over to the low-rise terraced house converted into flats, but a large rubbish bin was parked square in front of the house.</p>
      <p>“I don’t care, you need this photograph to show your grandchildren”.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I took what was my favourite image of the day, a happy couple in wedding gown and suit, smiling (and holding their breath) in front of a non-descript building with a green rubbish bin.</p>
      <p>So when you do take those wedding photographs, or think about the arrangements for your wedding, do the things and go to the places that have meaning and history to you.</p>
