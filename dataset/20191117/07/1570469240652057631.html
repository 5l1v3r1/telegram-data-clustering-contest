      <p>China and United States had "constructive talks" on trade in a high-level phone call on Saturday, news agency Reuters reported quoting state media Xinhua.</p>
      <p>China's Vice Premier Liu He, US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a phone call discussed each other's core issues for the first phase of an initial trade agreement and agreed to maintain close communication, according to Xinhua.</p>
      <p>Xinhua gave no other details in its report on Sunday.</p>
      <p>White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Thursday the two countries were getting close to an agreement about ending their 16-month trade war, but he gave no further details on the timing of a possible deal.</p>
      <p>The US and China are locked in a tariff war that have roiled financial markets and threatened to drag growth in the global economy to its lowest rate since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.</p>
      <p>An agreement had appeared likely in May, but those prospects were dashed after US negotiators said China backed away from the text of a draft agreement.</p>
      <p>Concerns flared again last week amid reports that the trade talks had hit a snag over how and when to reduce tariffs, and how much U.S. agricultural products China would commit to buy.</p>
