      <h1>The Crown's Olivia Colman says royals are just 'like any family' with one slight difference</h1>
      <h2>As the new Netflix series of The Crown starts, the stars, who play the Queen and Princess Margaret, talk about transforming in to royals, having to control their emotions on set, and getting the seal of approval from the real Princess Margaret</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lara Kilner, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lara-kilner/</a></address>
      <p>Such is the anticipation for the new series of  <i>The Crown</i>  that we feel like we’ve been waiting for as long as Charles’s been hanging on to sit on that throne.</p>
      <p>And finally it’s here, today, on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> , and we’re going to try to restrain ourselves from bingeing the whole lot in one sitting. </p>
      <p>There’s a full changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace, with the glorious, Oscar-winning Olivia Colman as Her Maj, and the brilliant Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret.</p>
      <p>Add to that Tobias Menzies as the older Duke of Edinburgh and new characters like Princess Anne, played by acting newbie Erin Doherty, and a now grown-up Prince Charles (Josh O’Connor), and the story has moved on to the 1960s.</p>
      <p>We see Charles getting used to public life as the Prince Of Wales, and the birth of Prince Edward. There’s a new government too, with Harold Wilson (Jason Watkins) in Downing Street. </p>
      <p>Here Helena and Olivia talk regal transformations, how to hold in those royal emotions during filming, and getting the seal of approval from the real Princess Margaret (yes, really).</p>

        <b>What was it like when you first got the call to play the Queen?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I was in the car with my family and my agent called. She was trying to be discreet and said it was something to do with tiaras and I didn’t know what she was talking about.</p>
      <p>When she finally said <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-crown">The Crown</a>, I was very uncool and said yes immediately.</p>
      <p>I tried to be less keen, but I was just as uncool when I met the producers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s going on with the Queen in this new series?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Queen and Prince Philip are more settled into their marriage, they’re more grown up and mature and dealing with their children coming of age.</p>
      <p>The same as any family, I suppose – young adults trying to fly the nest and the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/science/how-stop-your-annoying-hiccups-9636115">hiccups</a> that come with those sorts of things. Although it’s slightly different having a prince as your young adult…</p>

        <b>How was it transforming into the Queen?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It really is a huge team effort. It takes an hour and 15 minutes to put the wig on, apparently, but I didn’t even realise. I just sat there and had a cup of tea and a chat.</p>
      <p>No one even noticed it was a wig, people asked if I’d had my hair cut.</p>
      <p>The Queen has a different outfit for almost every scene and they’re all handmade. The teams are very skilled and brilliant and know the shapes that work on my body.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s it like on set?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The set is built inside an air hanger at Elstree studios, which is hard to imagine when you’re looking at it. I love it because it’s not actually a beautiful old house, you can bring a cup of tea in.</p>
      <p>We were also very privileged to film in people’s private homes and extraordinary places behind the velvet ropes.</p>
      <p>People were so welcoming, but you stand there waiting and suddenly realise you’re next to a Gainsborough painting!</p>
      <p>
        <b>What were your favourite scenes to film?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A highlight was to have another go at riding horses, and I did get to have a little amazing magical moment with a foal.</p>
      <p>I know that doesn’t really say much about the story, but for me it was really exciting.</p>
