        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michael-jackson/">Michael Jackson</a>’s eldest son Prince has sweetly remembered his late dad recently, as he channelled the late King Of Pop on the red carpet.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Over 10 years after Michael’s sudden death, Prince and his little sister Paris represented Michael at Motown’s 60th-anniversary celebration in Paris and it was a walk down nostalgic style lane.</p>
      <p>Wanting to bring a little of their dad into the wardrobes, both Prince and Paris revealed they still continue to work with their father’s stylist Rushka Bergman.</p>
      <p>Which explained Prince’s blinging jacket he wore, we suppose. Very MJ.</p>
      <p>Keeping his dad’s memory alive in subtle ways through how he dresses on the red carpet, Prince revealed a sweet throwback to watching his superstar father get ready with Rushka.</p>
      <p>‘I remember Rushka was my dad’s stylist. She would always come in with these large racks… my dad loved shiny things, blingy, you know?’ he told Vogue in a behind-the-scenes of the event.</p>

      <p>‘It was very cool that to see that I am like, not really being put in the same shoes, but almost doing a very similar thing.’</p>
      <p>Prince added that everything felt it was coming ‘full circle’.</p>
      <p>Sharing a sweet snap to social media with his sister, Prince later wrote: ‘I don’t always dress up…but when I do it’s with my gorgeous sister @parisjackson. Stay classy my friends.’</p>
      <p>Picking up with her older bro was putting down, Paris sweetly replied to his picture, sharing her pride in her sibling and what he’s achieved.</p>

      <p>Last month Prince told Extra: ‘My dad was always a strong believer in going for what you want and “go follow your dreams and chase your dreams…”</p>
      <p>‘So for us to be able to kind of sit there and hopefully make a career about talking about film and looking at film – my brother wants to be a director, I love producing…’</p>

      <p>He continued: ‘It’s just, it’s definitely, there’s some form of guidance there that kind of is ushering us into the next generation.’</p>
      <p>Prince, who also has brother Blanket, revealed the goal for the channel on the video-sharing platform is to ‘bring an educated yet family-friendly vibe’ for viewers tuning in.</p>
      <p>He explained: ‘Right now, it’s just me, my brother, and my cousin Taj, one camera in a room in our house, and we’re really focused on reviewing movies and current movies as they come out.</p>
      <p>‘We’re hoping to bring an educated yet family-friendly vibe into the movie-watching arena… We’re hoping to be in other forms of visual media — video games, virtual stuff like that.’</p>
