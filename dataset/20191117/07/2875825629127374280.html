      <h1>Harry Redknapp tells Tottenham to axe Christian Eriksen ahead of free transfer</h1>
      <h2>The Denmark international is set to leave Spurs on a free transfer when his current contract expires at the end of the season</h2>

      <p>Former Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp has urged Mauricio Pochettino to drop wantaway Christian Eriksen from his first-team squad.</p>
      <p>The Denmark international is set to leave Spurs when his current contract expires at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Eriksen expressed his desire to "try something new" during the summer but ended up staying with the North London club.</p>
      <p>However, with the Dane showing no indication of penning a new deal and able to negotiate a free transfer with other clubs in January, Redknapp says Pochettino should axe him as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see him signing a new contract now," he told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10360745/tottenham-must-sell-eriksen-now-says-redknapp/">The Sun</a> . "I think he will let it run out and take that option of being a free agent next summer.</p>

      <p>"So if he doesn’t want to stay and has made up his mind to go, I’d be looking to play someone else now.</p>
      <p>“If he doesn’t want to be part of the team, it’s very difficult — you want people who want to play for the club — and it’s time to say right, OK.”</p>
      <p>Despite establishing himself as one of the Premier League's top performers since his arrival from Ajax in 2013, Eriksen has struggled to find his best form this season.</p>

      <p>He has registered just one goal and one assist in 10 Premier League games as Spurs have failed to replicate the form that saw them reach the Champions League final last season - winning just three of their opening 12 matches.</p>
      <p>"He’s a great player, no doubt," added Redknapp, who managed Spurs from 2008 to 2012. "He’s a fantastic footballer, but his form of late has been poor.</p>
      <p>“He’s not in form and wants to leave at the end of the year — he’s stated quite plainly he is keen to go, even though <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> must have offered him a new contract.”</p>
      <p>Tottenham are currently 14th in the table and will be looking to end a run of five Premier League games without a win when they travel to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> next weekend after the international break.</p>
