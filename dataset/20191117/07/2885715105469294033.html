      <p>Fitness is a way of life and setting some major fitness goals is television actor Erica Fernandes, who is currently seen in Kasautii Zindagii Kay 2. The actor who recently bagged the ‘Female Actor Of The Year’ award at the sixth annual Asian Viewers Television Awards (AVTA), UK’s only event to celebrate the success of Asian television, is an inspiration for all those looking to switch to a healthy lifestyle for a fit, toned body.</p>
      <p>In a post, she mentioned, “Exercise not only changes your body. It changes your mind, your attitude and your mood.” Take a look!</p>

      <p>A well-rounded fitness program includes training to improve joint function, bone density, muscle, tendon and ligament strength, as well as aerobic exercise to improve heart and lung fitness, flexibility and balance exercises. From lifting to outdoor strength training, here is what the actor does which has helped her achieve her picture-perfect washboard abs.</p>
      <h3>Weight lifting and other functional training</h3>

      <p>While weightlifting increases a lot of stability and strength, it helps burn fat and lose weight as well. It helps you gain a lot of strength and stability for your daily tasks like lifting a heavy bag or moving a heavy object. Other functional training are lunges and squats.</p>
      <h3>Outdoor workouts</h3>

      <p>Working out outdoors allows you to gain strength and increases your fresh oxygen intake (provided the air is cleaner). Fernandes seems to be fond of a lot of outdoor stretching and climbing exercises to keep herself fit.</p>

      <h3>Resistance training</h3>

      <p>Resistance training which includes resistance bands shaped in the form of a giant rubber band, provide resistance when stretched. They are portable and can be adapted to most workouts. The bands provide continuous resistance throughout a movement. Fernandes can be seen doing it to strengthen her core and tone her body.</p>
      <h3>Rope and rock climbing</h3>

      <p>If you wish to develop your grip, rope climbing is a great way to do it. It helps build biceps and upper body while developing physical and mental strength. If performed correctly and under guidance, rope climbing helps develop endurance and ability to master your own weight.</p>

      <p>Another way is rock climbing which works on both your upper and lower body muscles. It helps strengthen muscles in the back and arms when pulling oneself up and helps to engage the muscles of the core, quads, and calves for stability. Fernandes also ensures she includes a lot of climbing outdoors.</p>
