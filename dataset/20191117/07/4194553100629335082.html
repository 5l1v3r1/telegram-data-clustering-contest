      <h1>(Video) Sky Sports’ PL title race promo will get your blood pumping</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:32:15+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Sky Sports have published a promotional video for the 2019/20 Premier League title race, with Liverpool and Manchester City taking centre stage.</p>
      <p>The promo has some favourable and painful call backs for Reds’ supporters, as we see our men lifting the title back in the day.</p>
      <p>But, of course, we also have to witness club great Steven Gerrard slipping as he loses control of the ball. I seriously wish they’d leave that alone!</p>
      <p>
