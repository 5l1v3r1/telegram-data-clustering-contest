      <p>Edwards, a conservative Democrat, is the party's only governor in the Deep South. He campaigned on the state's strengthening economy.</p>
      <p>Trump, who had won 58 percent of the popular vote in Louisiana in the 2016 presidential election, had travelled to the state three times to support Rispone, a Republican businessman, and repeatedly supported the candidate on Twitter.</p>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon he urged voters on Twitter: "Louisiana, 3 hours left, get out and Vote for @EddieRispone for Governor. Lower taxes and much more!"</p>
      <p>In conceding the election, Rispone said he was disappointed in the result.</p>
      <p>"We have nothing to be ashamed of," he told supporters, and thanked Trump for campaigning for him in the state.</p>
      <p>"He (Trump) came down here three times specifically to try to help us," he said.</p>
      <p>The Democrat victory comes after mixed results in other recent elections.</p>
      <p>In Kentucky's gubernatorial election last week, Democratic challenger Andy Beshear defeated Republican Governor Matt Bevin despite the president's endorsement, while Democrats have also taken full control of state government in Virginia.</p>
      <p>In Mississippi earlier this month, Republicans comfortably kept control of the statehouse following strong support from Trump.</p>
      <p>Tom Perez, chairman of the DNC, said Edwards' victory was another sign of the "surging strength" of Democrats.</p>
      <p>"Louisiana, Kentucky, and Virginia have delivered a devastating warning to Donald Trump's Republican Party," he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Democrats are competing and winning in every corner of the country. Less than a year before the 2020 election, the wind is firmly at our backs," he added.</p>
      <p>The DNC invested heavily in the Louisiana Democratic Party to support Democrats' election efforts.</p>
