      <h2>England have already made it to Euro 2020 so Sunday's clash with Kosovo is something of a dead rubber, given the hosts cannot make it</h2>

      <p>Gareth Southgate will likely not rotate his squad too significantly as England travel to Kosovo.</p>
      <p>The Three Lions have booked their place at Euro 2020 on the back of their 7-0 win over Montenegro on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>It opens up the chance for England to give opportunities to the likes of James Maddison and Tammy Abraham, but Southgate is expected to stick with one of his strongest possible teams.</p>
      <p>England have almost definitely topped the group, as they hold a three point lead over the Czech Republic, with the better head-to-head and also a remarkably bigger goal difference.</p>
      <p>Here is the key information ahead of the game...</p>
