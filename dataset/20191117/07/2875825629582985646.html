      <h1>Man Utd 'draw up shortlist' of eight long-term transfer targets</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has reportedly identified eight long-term targets, including Jadon Sancho and Erling Haaland</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:35:46+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:35</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United have reportedly drawn up a shortlist of eight long-term transfer targets.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is likely to be given funds to strengthen in January as he bids to take United back into the top four of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>A move for Mario Mandzukic continues to be mooted with the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> striker free to leave when the transfer window reopens.</p>
      <p>But ahead of January, Solskjaer has reportedly identified another eight players he wants to bring to Old Trafford.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-line-up-200m-20889527">Mirror Sport reported last week</a> that United are keen on striking a £200m double swoop for Jadon Sancho and Erling Haaland.</p>

      <p>While £100m Sancho would go straight into the side, United are considering loaning Haaland back to Red Bull Salzburg as he continues his remarkable campaign.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/manchester-united/story/3990703/sources-manchester-united-to-make-enquiry-over-haaland-availability-in-january">ESPN reports</a> there are a host of other players on Solskjaer's radar, all of whom are under 27, in a clear shift of transfer strategy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> and England star James Maddison also on United's wishlist, as is his international teammate Declan Rice.</p>

      <p>With a striker remaining a priority, United have reportedly identified Lyon's Moussa Dembele while Callum Wilson could bring some Premier League experience.</p>
      <p>United have also made checks on Aston Villa pair John McGinn and Jack Grealish.</p>
      <p>These targets are likely to be long-term options for United but they could make a move in January, if they do become available.</p>
