      <p><b>Lucknow</b>: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) meeting is underway to deliberate on whether or not to seek a review of the Supreme Court’s verdict on the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit last week that paved the way for the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.</p>
      <p>The parties met All India Muslim Personal Law Board general secretary Maulana Wali Rahmani and discussed the Ayodhya issue, Zafaryab Jilani, who is secretary of the board, said.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>They said that the Supreme Court decision is "not understandable" and so there is a need to go for a review, Jilani said.</p>
      <p>In a unanimous verdict last week, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya and directed the Centre to allot a five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a mosque.</p>
      <p>Soon after the verdict, the AIMPLB had expressing dissatisfaction with it and said the board was considering seeking a review of the judgment.</p>
      <p>Jilani said the AIMPLB will hold a meeting on Sunday to decide whether to go for a review of the top court's verdict.</p>
      <p>He also said the Muslim parties were of the view that the five-acre land for a mosque in Ayodhya as proposed by the Supreme Court should not be taken.</p>
