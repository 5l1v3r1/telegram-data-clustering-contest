        <b>A cyclist is in hospital with serious head injuries after a 'hit and run' collision with a car last night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The incident happened around 10.39pm in Gill Lane, Longton.</p>
      <p>Police say the 18-year-old youth was cycling along the road in the direction of Leyland when he was "involved in collision with an unknown vehicle which caused him to fall from his bike.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said the teenager was taken to Royal Preston Hospital with critical injuries which required surgery. He remains in hospital.</p>
      <p>The other vehicle involved failed to stop at the scene and it is believed to have continued along the road towards Leyland.</p>
      <p>Sgt Martin Wilcock of Lancashire Police’s Tac Ops Division, said: “Our thoughts are with the injured young man at this time.</p>
      <p>“We are making a number of enquiries as part of our investigation into the collision, but we need to trace the driver of the other vehicle involved.</p>
      <p>“If you were the driver I would urge you to search your conscience and do the right thing by coming forward so we can establish what happened.</p>
      <p>“If you witnessed the collision or have any information at all that may help, please get in touch.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information should email 365@lancashire.pnn.police.uk or call 101 quoting log number 1564 of 16th November.</p>
