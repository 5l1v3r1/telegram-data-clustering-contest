      <h2>From Rhys Jones' killers to a lad who stabbed his love rival, these teenagers, all under the age of 18, threw away their futures when they chose to take away other people's lives</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:54:08+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:54</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Docking, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/neil-docking/, Tiffany Lo</a></address>
      <p>These teenage killers are responsible for some of the most shocking and callous murders in recent times.</p>
      <p>The boys - driven by hatred, jealousy or greed - had not even reached their 18th birthday when they struck.</p>
      <p>Parents have had their families ripped apart due to the rising wave of knife crime across the UK.</p>
      <p>Some of the killers could soon be free to roam the streets, despite being sent to jail with life sentences, reports the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/evil-killer-kids-who-murdered-17266997">Liverpool Echo</a>.</p>
      <p>Here are some of evil 'killer kids' who robbed victims of their futures:</p>
      <h3>Joe Ward</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/teen-who-brutally-murdered-18-16322244">Joe Ward</a> stabbed his young love rival  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/teen-who-brutally-murdered-18-16322244">Eddie O'Rourke</a>  to death with a 12-inch knife.</p>
      <p>The murderer was handed the weapon by a 15-year-old pal, who was cleared of murder, but convicted of manslaughter.</p>
      <p>Ward, then 17, struck at a young woman's 18th birthday party at the Royal British Legion in Runcorn, on the evening of September 7, 2018.</p>
      <p>Jealous Ward and Eddie, 18, had regularly clashed over a girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, over whom Ward had become "obsessed".</p>

        <figcaption>Eddie O'Rourke, 18, was stabbed to death following a party at Halton Royal British Legion, Runcorn</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Ward was supposed to have a clean fight with Eddie in Halton Brook on August 12, 2017, but slashed his left arm with a blade.</p>
      <p>Over the course of the next 12 months he made sinister threats to Eddie, and also texting the girl saying: "I'll cut his face, the fat goon."</p>
      <p>His accomplice also messaged another girl, who he mistakenly thought was seeing Eddie, telling her: "Leg it u s*** – gna cut ur fella to pieces."</p>
      <p>Then, on the night of the party Eddie and Ward came to blows again, with Eddie gesturing to Ward to take part in a supposed "no weapons" fight.</p>
      <p>Ward, who had initially walked outside with Eddie, ran back inside the social club in Castle Road, where his friend passed him the knife.</p>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p> He plunged the "sword-like" blade, described by a witness as being  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/name-teen-killer-lips-police-16337101">"like something in Pirates of the Caribbean"</a>  , into the stomach of his victim.</p>
      <p>However, he claimed he acted in self-defence and that he only "jabbed" out at Eddie because he was petrified of him.</p>
      <p>Ward, 18, of Lockfield, Runcorn, was jailed for life with a minimum of 16 years behind bars.</p>
      <p>His friend was locked up for just seven years.</p>
      <h3>Andrew Hewitt, Corey Hewitt, Joseph McGill, Keyfer Dykstra and their leader Reese O’Shaughnessey</h3>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The group of yobs were found guilty of murder for cornering and murdering Sean McHugh in the back of a launderette.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old, nicknamed Shorty, died days after suffering a single stab wound from a sword stick at the Priory Road launderette, on September 30, 2013.</p>
      <p>Four young boys: cousins Andrew Hewitt, 15, and Corey Hewitt, 14 but 13 at the time; Joseph McGill, 14, also 13 at the time; and Keyfer Dykstra, 14, were found guilty of murder.</p>
      <p>So was the gang's "leader" Reese O'Shaughnessey, 19, following a month-long trial at Liverpool Crown Court.</p>
      <p>Sean and his friend Josh Williams had been doing their washing at the launderette when they encountered some of the boys on the road outside.</p>
      <p>More boys arrived, including O'Shaughnessey, who was carrying a sword stick, part of a mini arsenal the gang kept on a nearby cinder path.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>CCTV cameras captured him and Dykstra, who had a knife, started hammering on the door to the back room, where Sean was hiding, before kicking it open.</p>
      <p>The ringleader stabbed the victim in the leg, before he managed to get away into the backyard, where he was later found bleeding to death by police.</p>
      <p>O'Shaughnessey, who fetched the murder weapon, was jailed for life with a minimum of 18 years for what a judge said was a "truly wicked crime".</p>
      <p>Dysktra - the "second in command" who led the charge after him was handed a minimum term of 12 years.</p>
      <p>Andrew Hewitt, who was the first to physically confront their victim, was locked up for a minimum of nine years.</p>
      <p>McGill, who gave Dykstra a knife and poured detergent on the floor to hamper Sean's escape received a minimum eight-year sentence.</p>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Corey Hewitt, who did not take part in the attack physically but picked up the abandoned murder weapon as they left, got a minimum six-year sentence.</p>
      <p>The lout, said to have an IQ of 69, putting him in the lowest two per cent of the population, later  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/shorty-mchugh-murderer-free-year-13886522">had his minimum term cut to five years on appeal</a>  .</p>
      <p>Judge Clement Goldstone, QC, said that Sean and his friend Josh were from Walton, the home of a gang called the Walton Village Heads.</p>
      <p>He said this gang were the sworn enemies of the Laneheads, of which the killers were "fully paid up, card carrying and enthusiastic members".</p>
      <p>The judge said Sean was chased partly in revenge for the stabbing of Dykstra in a fight with a Walton boy some months before.</p>
      <p>But that had nothing to do with him and there was no evidence he was part of any gang.</p>

      <p>Twisted <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/face-teen-who-murdered-oap-14585335">Cameron Cruddace</a>  murdered an OAP with a claw hammer then  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/face-teen-who-murdered-oap-14585335">falsely claimed his victim was a paedophile</a>  .</p>
      <p>He struck  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/face-teen-who-murdered-oap-14585335">Richard Percival</a>  , 71, at least 12 times in a frenzied attack, before rifling through his pockets and stealing £620.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old, who bragged he was “born to kill”, admitted smashing in his victim’s skull and blowing the cash on cocaine.</p>
      <p>But he claimed he “flipped” after Mr Percival sexually assaulted him and was only guilty of manslaughter, due to loss of self control.</p>
      <p>Judge Alan Conrad, QC, locked him up for life, with a minimum of 20 years behind bars, for the "brutal" killing on August 17, 2017.</p>
      <p>He said: "You told numerous lies – both before and during your trial. Mr Percival was not here to refute your assertions against him.</p>
      <p>"You never told anybody about it before the killing – neither your friends nor your sister, to whom you were particularly close.</p>
      <figure>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"Furthermore, on your account, Mr Percival, having made a particularly serious advance to you in early 2017, you chose to go back to his house six months later.</p>
      <p>"These allegations were invented by you after the murder to provide some justification for what you did."</p>
      <p>Mr Percival, who lived in Newton-le-Willows, was a "club legend" at Vulcan FC, who he played for in his youth, and later helped run.</p>
      <p>Both his family and pals said they were deeply upset by the false accusations "cowardly" Cruddace tried to rely on to excuse his guilt.</p>
      <p>The teen bludgeoned the OAP at his Dixon Avenue home with the hammer, which he later ditched along with his clothes.</p>
      <p>Judge Conrad said: "He was a decent, harmless and well-liked man, who kept to himself and loved sport.</p>
      <p>"He let you into his home for conversation and to allow you to earn some money doing odd jobs.</p>
      <p>"He was small in stature and slightly built and in no position to resist the vicious and sustained armed attack.”</p>
      <p>Cruddace, of Oak Avenue, Newton-le-Willows, told his lawyer: "There’s no point in being sorry because it’s not going to affect things."</p>
