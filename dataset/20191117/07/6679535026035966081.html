      <p>Pakistani troops shelled forward posts and villages along the Line of Control (LoC) in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday, a defence spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>The unprovoked firing of mortar shells in Shahpur sector started around 10.15 a.m., prompting befitting retaliation by the Indian Army, he said.</p>
      <p>Officials said mortar shells fired by Pakistan also hit Kerni and Qasba areas of the district.</p>
      <p>There was no report of any casualty in the shelling, which has prompted people to take shelter in safe places such as underground bunkers.</p>
      <p>The cross-border firing was going on from both sides when last reports came in.</p>
