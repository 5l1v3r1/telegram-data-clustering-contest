      <p>DUBAI: Mere hours after she rocked the stage in Dubai, British pop star Dua Lipa jetted off to Mumbai, where she was pictured with Bollywood’s who’s who — including superstar Shah Rukh Khan — before playing a packed out gig this weekend.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Lipa returned to the UAE for yet another concert. The singer, who’s of Albanian descent, headlined The Pointe’s second-ever concert on Dubai‘s Palm Jumeirah, following in the footsteps of Latin star Enrique Iglesias who headlined the inaugural concert in December 2018. The performance was Lipa’s third concert in the UAE. Fans of the British hitmaker will remember last November when the singer was slated to perform at the Louvre Abu Dhabi’s first anniversary, but had to cancel her show at the last minute due to a rainstorm.</p>

      <p>The 24-year-old jetted off to Mumbai to perform at the One Plus Music Festival on Nov. 16. The certified hitmaker took to the stage at the DY Patil Stadium to belt out some of her biggest tunes, such as “Hotter Than Hell,” “New Rules” and “Be the One.”  She performed alongside the likes of international popstar Katy Perry, music composer Amit Trivedi and EDM artist Ritviz.</p>
      <p>“So excited to go back to India this week!!” She wrote on Instagram ahead of the concert. “I’ve never had the chance to perform in front of you and I’m excited to share the stage with sweet mutha KPez @katyperry!!!! Yaaaaay x (sic).”</p>
      <p>Naturally, she documented her visit to the South Asian nation via her Instagram page, where she shared a number of snapshots of her performance with her 38.5 million followers. She also took to the social media platform to upload throwbacks of her visit to Jaipur, including a snap of herself learning how to wear the traditional saree.</p>

      <p>Lipa also posted a picture of herself and Perry blowing kisses towards the camera. She revealed that she was “fizzing with excitement front stage.”</p>
      <p>“It took me back to 15-year-old me at my first Katy Perry show! Still just the same!!” she excitedly wrote.</p>

      <p>Perry, who touched down in India earlier this week, has been living it up in the capital of Maharashtra state. Upon her arrival, Indian director Karan Johar threw the “Fireworks” singer a star-studded party in his Carter Road residence.</p>
      <p>The guest list for the soiree featured the who’s who of Bollywood, including everyone from Alia Bhatt and Anushka Sharma to Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan, among many others.</p>
