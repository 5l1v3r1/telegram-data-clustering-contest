      <p>Defence Minister Rajnath Singh held talks with U.S. Defence Secretary Mark T Esper in Bangkok on Sunday on a range of issues of strategic importance including situation in the Indo-Pacific region and ways to further bolster bilateral security cooperation.</p>
      <p>The meeting took place on the sidelines of the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus), a platform comprising ASEAN and its eight dialogue partners including India, officials said here.</p>
      <p>The defence minister also held a separate meeting with his Japanese counterpart Taro Kono with a focus on adding further momentum to bilateral defence cooperation.</p>
      <p>In the meeting with Mr. Esper, Mr. Singh reaffirmed New Delhi’s vision for a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region based on a rules-based order and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
      <p>China has been fast expanding military and economic influence in the Indo-Pacific region, triggering concern in various countries of the region and beyond.</p>
      <p>Mr. Singh said there has been a growing convergence between India and the US on the Indo-Pacific, adding the 10-member grouping of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is central to New Delhi’s vision for the region.</p>
      <p>“Had an excellent meeting with US Secretary of Defence, Dr. Mark T Esper in Bangkok today. We talked about ways to expand defence cooperation between India and the United States,” he tweeted.</p>
      <p>Mr. Singh conveyed to his American counterpart that he was looking forward to have substantial discussions during the deliberations under the ‘two-plus-two’ foreign and defence ministerial dialogue between the two countries in Washington later next month, the defence ministry said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The inaugural Indo-US ‘two-plus-two’ talks took place here in September last year.</p>
      <p>Expressing happiness on the growing Indo-US ties, Mr. Singh said the cooperation between the two sides has grown across a wide range of sectors, including defence and security, economy, energy, counter-terrorism and people-to-people relationship.</p>
      <p>Mr. Singh and Mr. Esper also discussed a number of key issues concerning regional security and bilateral defence cooperation.</p>
      <p>The ADMM-Plus is also likely to review the evolving security scenario in the region, particularly in the maritime domain.</p>
      <p>The inaugural ADMM-Plus was convened in Hanoi in 2010. The Defence Ministers then had agreed on five areas of practical cooperation to pursue under the new mechanism, including maritime security, counter-terrorism, humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping operations.</p>
