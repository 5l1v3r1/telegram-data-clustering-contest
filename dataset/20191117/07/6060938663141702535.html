      <h1>Environmental DNA test may reveal where birds flock together: Study</h1>

      <p>MELBOURNE: In a first, researchers have shown that environmental <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/DNA">DNA</a> (eDNA) can be used to detect the presence of an endangered <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/bird">bird</a> species by collecting and analysing small amounts of water from the pools where they drink -- an advance that may lead to better assessment of animal and bird populations in the wild.</p>
      <p>The study, published in the journal Endangered Species Research, noted that eDNA -- which is DNA collected from environmental samples like soil, seawater, or even air rather than direct sampling from an individual organism -- can be used to detect the presence of threatened terrestrial species in an ecosystem.</p>
      <p>The researchers, including those from the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Charles-Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> University in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Australia">Australia</a>, developed a genetic probe that targets and identifies the eDNA of the endangered <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gouldian-finch">Gouldian finch</a> -- a rainbow-coloured bird found in northern Australia.</p>
      <p>The researchers developed a test in which multiple copies of a species-specific probe is made to detect Gouldian finch DNA.</p>
      <p>The technique also amplifies probes against a fragment of DNA found in the mitochondria of estrildid finches -- a family that includes masked finches, and long-tailed finches, they said.</p>
      <p>The Gouldian finches, the researchers said, often drank at waterholes in mixed flocks with the masked finches and long-tailed finches.</p>
      <p>The research team showed that the finch eDNA could be reliably detected from a 200 millilitres of water sample collected from waterholes visited by the birds in the last 48 hours.</p>
      <p>The study noted that in the waterholes with the most birds, Gouldian finch DNA could still be detected 14 days after sample collection -- regardless of whether the sample was stored at room temperature, or refrigerated.</p>
      <p>The researchers said if the Gouldian test came negative, the eDNA test still worked -- meaning the Gouldian finches were not present at that site.</p>
      <p>"It's a much more accurate test. By having primers that pick-up other finches it tells us that the eDNA is good enough quality to be amplified," said study co-author Karen Gibb of Charles Darwin University.</p>
      <p>"When it worked in the real world at the waterholes, even where the water was poor quality in places -- where it was hot and looked a bit oily -- we were really excited," Gibb said.</p>
