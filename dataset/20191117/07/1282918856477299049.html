      <h3>"I had my chances, but was not able to take them"</h3>
      <p>In a press conference after the match, he mentioned how he was off the rhythm and missed out on two smashes, which had not happened in a long, long time or probably forever. He said, "No doubt I had my chances. [I] had some good spells, but the spells where things were not working well, they were pretty bad. At this level, you just can't have it happen, so that was pretty disappointing. I thought for the first ten games, (was doing okay) but then again, he broke 2-0 in the second set. You have the chance of taking the lead in the second set and to throw it away, however, I did it, it's just frustrating."</p>
      <p>"But look, across the net, I thought he played really well. He took the ball early, I know he does that. I thought I returned pretty well on the first serve, second serve of breakpoints and all that but for the most part, I was not quite getting into the rallies that we wanted to. But I think I have to credit him for pushing me into not playing at the level I was hoping to today," he added.</p>

      <p>On future improvement, he said that he will have to "keep on playing at the level he has been this year so that he can create chances". The Swiss also said that he has played "consistent, solid tennis and that he has to listen to the signs, take care of his body, get the balance right". Federer emphasised on figuring out key moments next year, which he failed at doing on Saturday, and also at different points during the season such as the Wimbledon or the Indian Wells. </p>

      <p>Federer had a relatively mild season, where he did not win any Grand Slam. However, he won four titles and crossed the 100 ATP titles mark — ending the year with a grand total of 103 ATP titles. Federer, despite being doubted by all naysayers about his physical and mental fitness, is going strong and will look to only add to his total of 20 Grand Slam titles in 2020. He will also be representing Switzerland in the Tokyo Olympics, where he'll be chasing his first Gold medal.</p>
