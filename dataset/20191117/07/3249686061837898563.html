      <p><b><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/taeyeon">Taeyeon</a></b> has dropped her MV for '<b>Into the Unknown</b>' (End Credit Version).</p>
      <p>Just like <b>Hyorin</b> sang "<b>Let It Go</b>" for the first '<b>Frozen</b>', Taeyeon will be singing the version of "Into the Unknown" that will play at the end credits for '<b>Frozen 2</b>'. The song is different from the version that <b>Elsa</b> will be singing in the movie, but it's still an amazing version that combines scenes from the new movie along with clips of Taeyeon in the recording studio.</p>
      <p>Check it out above.</p>
