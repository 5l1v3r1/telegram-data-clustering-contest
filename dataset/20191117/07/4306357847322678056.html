      <h3>Pat Nevin says the only thing that could halt Liverpool FC’s title charge is injuries to key players.</h3>
      <p>The Reds are sitting eight points clear at the top of the Premier League table following a run of 11 victories and one stalemate.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s men were 3-1 winners against defending champions Manchester City at Anfield last weekend.</p>
      <p>The Merseyside outfit moved eight points clear of Leicester City and Chelsea FC in the title race.</p>
      <p>Manchester City were without key players Aymeric Laporte and Ederson for the trip to Merseyside.</p>
      <p>Although Liverpool FC were without Alisson for a spell this season, the Reds haven’t suffered any injuries to key players such as Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Sadio Mane.</p>
      <p>Former Chelsea FC winger Nevin believes that Liverpool FC could struggle if Salah or Van Dijk succumb to injury.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know anyone who thinks Man City are close to favourites to win the title,” Nevin told the <i>Off The Ball</i> podcast on Irish radio station <i>Newstalk</i>.</p>
      <p>“That’s a big thing to say because Man City are a brilliant team. It tells you what everyone thinks of Liverpool. They can’t afford to get big injuries to Van Dijk or Salah. If they keep those two fit, they’ve got enough across the rest of the pitch… ”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC finished in second place in the Premier League table last season after the Reds collected a club-record 97 points.</p>
      <p>The Reds haven’t won the Premier League title but have finished in second place in 2002, 2009, 2014 and 2018.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC won their first trophy under Klopp last season thanks to a 2-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League final last term.</p>
      <p>The Merseyside outfit will take on Crystal Palace in their next Premier League game on Saturday 23 November.</p>
