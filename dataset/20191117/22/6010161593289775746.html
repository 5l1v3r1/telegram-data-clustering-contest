      <h1>Torchlight Frontiers gets delayed, not coming in 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:31:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:31</time> by <a rel="author">Emily Gera</a></address>
      <p>Shared-world action RPG Torchlight Frontiers won’t make its planned 2019 release window.</p>
      <p>News of Torchlight Frontiers’ delay was revealed by Blizzard North co-founder and Echtra Games CEO Max Schaefer during a Path of Exile fan convention in New Zealand over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/torchlight-frontiers-is-delayed-wont-be-coming-in-2019/">PC Gamer</a>, Schaefer said the title will not release in the “2019 time frame that was indicated two and a half years ago.”</p>
      <p>“We have not updated that yet which we probably should,” Schaefer continues. “But we don’t have really specific things to say. We’re doing some changes to the game right now that is kind of hard to pin down. We don’t really have better information to give yet. So that’s kind of why we’ve been waiting. But obviously it’s not going to make it right away. It’s plugging along and it’s getting better every day. And we’re really excited about it. It’s just we’re kind of waiting for the right time to like, come out with another big news dump about what’s going on.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.vg247.com/2018/08/09/torchlight-frontiers-action-rpg-shared-world-announced/">First announced last year</a>, Torchlight Frontiers features a share, persistent, dynamically generated world. In the game players and their pets team up to “hack and slack their way through” the game. The game is in development at Echtra Games and led by Max Schaefer. The rest of the team is made up of personnel who worked on the Diablo and Torchlight franchises. The game is being developed for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</p>
