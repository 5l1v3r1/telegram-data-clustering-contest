      <h1>Prendergast knows it will be different for Racing at Thomond Park next week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:14:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/john-fallon/" target="_blank">By John Fallon</a></address>
      <p>Racing 92 30 - 10 Saracens</p>
      <p>And so to the match between the haves and the have-lots to wrap up the opening weekend of Heineken Champions Cup rugby. Saracens came into it whinging about the punishment meted out to them for apparently breaking their €8m Premiership salary cap.</p>
      <p>Racing 92, surviving on an overall budget of €31.8m in the Top 14, did what most French teams do in these scenarios, just shrugged their shoulders and wondered what all the fuss was about.</p>
      <p>The last week or two might seem surreal for Saracens as the glitter faded from their silverware in the row over the salary budget — and their decision to send a second-string to Paris and hold back their World Cup stars had an inevitable outcome today.</p>
      <p>It means Racing 92 will come to Thomond Park on Saturday brimful of confidence after this bonus-point win against the champions.</p>
      <p>Of course, it’s one thing producing a display in their air-conditioned arena in Paris and quite another doing it in front of a raucous Thomond Park crowd on a typical Irish November evening. But they were full of showbiz in front of 20,275 supporters today, full of running and out-the-back passes. Even Donnacha Ryan ended up playing scrum-half at a couple of rucks.</p>
      <p>Racing 92, though, can also do the conventional well. The bonus-point try from Wenceslas Lauret came after a perfect lineout drive which they executed from 15 metres to secure the extras.</p>
      <p>“Our set-piece was good and that gave us a good platform,” said attack coach and former Munster scrum-half Mike Prendergast.</p>
      <p>Simon Zebo, whose prep time for this game was curtailed as he and his partner were expecting their third child in the past few days, was limited to a run in the closing minutes as Racing eased to victory.</p>
      <p>The power of Virimi Vakatawa in the centre was awesome, so too was the slicing runs and brilliant offloads from Finn Russell at out-half. They oozed class all over the field and would have chalked up a massive score had they been a bit more clinical in the second half.</p>
      <blockquote>We know it will be different against Munster next week, but the important thing for us was to go to Limerick on the back of a win, and getting the bonus point just adds that bit extra to it. But it will be a different test,</blockquote>
      <p>Racing led 18-3 at the break, with Vakatawa punishing slack defending for the opening try and then a superb move involving full-back Brice Dulin, Russell and Henry Chavancy sent Teddy Thomas over in the right corner.</p>
      <p>Saracens didn’t let the game slip away from them, and a try by Alex Lozowski five minutes after the restart helped cut the gap to eight points and give their surprisingly large number of fans something to shout about.</p>
      <p>But the response from Racing was impressive, with Russell instigating the move which he finished off a couple of phases later beside the posts for a magnificent try. Then came the bonus point from a bit of old-style rugby on a day when most other things were more modern.</p>
      <p>Racing now turn their sights to Thomond Park and a step back to a more traditional rugby day out. Saracens are set to drop their planned appeal against a £5.4m fine and a 35-point penalty for a breach of the salary cap — the deadline for serving notice of appeal passes later tomorrow.</p>
