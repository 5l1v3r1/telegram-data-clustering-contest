      <p>Jimmy Seville, 63, initially knew he had a different dad growing up and sought to find him when he was old enough.</p>
      <p>“Twelve years old I knew I had a different dad,” Seville <a href="https://fox4kc.com/2019/11/17/man-meets-his-seven-siblings-after-50-years/">told</a> WDAF. “And then my goal was when I got old enough that I would seek out this person.”</p>
      <p>He thought he found his dad in 1995, but he turned out to be wrong.</p>
      <p>“And turned out he wasn’t my dad,” Seville said. “So I kinda gave up, and I start back looking.”</p>
      <p>In September 2019, Seville took a DNA test with ancestry.com when the name “Dylan Decker” came up.</p>
      <p>“Mom says I need to tell you something,” Seville <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOPaqQ3GxQ4">recalled</a> his mother telling him in October. “She pulls out a manila envelope and in that envelope is a picture of a gentleman in a Navy uniform. Young, good-looking, and she says ‘this is your dad.’”</p>
      <p>Seville said he was irked by his mother’s decision to hide this information from her, but he decided to remain cordial with her.</p>
      <p>Seville also learned that his dad was dead shortly after finding out about his existence.</p>
      <p>“The obituary kinda threw me because usually they put all your siblings and connections and everything and nothing was there,” Seville said.</p>
      <p>Seville’s curiosity brought him to Facebook, where he typed in several names in connection with his late father. A Facebook conversation between one of the brothers, Donald Decker, led to their meeting in person on November 15.</p>
      <p>“I knew right off the bat that he was my brother,” Donald Decker said. “His eyes were just like my father’s, his hands had the same hairline.”</p>
      <p>Seville said he plans to meet with his reunited family members more often.</p>
