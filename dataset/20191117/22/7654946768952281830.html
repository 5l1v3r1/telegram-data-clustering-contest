      <h1>NYPD cop in fatal crash got at least 10 traffic citations this year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:11:34+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author">Kevin Sheehan and Jorge Fitz-Gibbon</a></address>
      <p>The NYPD lead foot killed when he <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/nypd-officer-dead-2-critically-injured-in-deadly-crash-on-fdr-sources/">crashed his car on the FDR Drive</a> Saturday had been busted speeding and blowing red lights at least 10 times this year, The Post has learned — including one citation for speeding in a school zone on Halloween issued just days before the wreck, which also left two passengers with severe injuries.</p>
      <p>The plate registered to 25-year-old Garman Chen’s 2016 Lexus — HCG-5421 — was slapped with seven camera violations for speeding in a school zone this year, three for blowing through red lights and one for not displaying a meter receipt, city records show.</p>
      <p>The latest ticket — a $50 fine for zooming through a school zone on Ocean Parkway and Beverly Road on Halloween Oct. 31 — was sent to Chen on Nov. 4 and remained unpaid when he crashed early Saturday, records show.</p>
      <p>“He always speed,” said Marvin Chen, 75, a neighbor who is not related to the cop. “I always say to him, ‘Take it easy. Where you going in such a hurry?’ I stand in front of his car and hold up my hands. I say take it easy and he no listen. It’s sad.”</p>
      <p>Another neighbor who shares a driveway with Chen attested to his need for speed.</p>
      <p>“We share a driveway and he drives quite fast,” said the man, who identified himself as Kachun and lives next door to the Midwood home where Chen lived with his parents. “It is tight back there and he drives very fast. Surprisingly fast.”</p>
      <p>“Normally people drive very slow, but not him,” he said. “There is not much room back there but he is young and drives sporty, very fast.”</p>
      <p>The three-year veteran cop, most recently assigned to the 76th Precinct, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/nypd-officer-killed-in-tragic-car-crash-identified-as-garman-chen-sources/">was driving on the FDR</a> near 23rd Street “at a high rate of speed” when he lost control of the Lexus about 2:30 a.m., according to cops.</p>
      <p>The car is <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/shocking-video-shows-moment-car-driven-by-nypd-officer-garman-chen-crashes-on-fdr-drive/">seen on video speeding before it veers</a> off the road and slams into a barrier.</p>
      <p>His two passengers, a city firefighter and his girlfriend, were not wearing seat belts and were thrown from the car, police said Sunday.</p>
      <p>Both were listed in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital.</p>
      <p>Police are investigating whether Chen was racing when he lost control, according to sources.</p>
