      <p>Caitlyn Jenner spent the night sleeping on the floor in Snake Rock after losing out on the first day of I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here!</p>
      <p>Caitlyn was partnered with James Haskell as they faces off against the other celebs to become a ‘power couple’.</p>
      <p>The power couples would get better living conditions and eat nice food on the first night, and also have control the fates of the other celebs in Snake Rock.</p>
      <p>The reality TV star had to face a sky dive first of all, which she was more than ready to do as the rest of her famous family – the Kardashian-Jenners – have all skydived before.</p>
      <p>She joked: ‘I’m a pilot and flown for 45 years but I’ve never jumped out of one. Everyone has always asked me over the years, “have you ever jumped?” and I’ve always said “no” because my plane has always worked.</p>

      <p>‘Kendall has skydived, Kim has and I think Kourtney has. I’m gonna do this, everyone in my family has done it.’</p>
      <p>Caitlyn and James travelled to the Pontoon of Doom by canoe, along with Nadine Coyle and her partner Adele Roberts.</p>

      <p>When the challenge kicked off they had to unscrew tokens from inside holes full of critters.</p>
      <p>Dec revealed that they managed to retrieve their tokes in eight minutes and 8 seconds, however they lost to Adele and Nadine who got theirs in five minutes and 21 seconds.</p>
      <p>After the challenge was over, they joined Ian Wright, Jacqueline Jossa, Kate Garraway and Andrew Maxwell were sent to Snake Rock where they awaited their feast of beans and rice.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline was horrified to see that there were no beds and they would be sleeping on the ground.</p>
      <p>But Caitlyn wanted to make the best of it, telling the other celebs.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘We’ve had to straighten our camp up, kind of find out what everything is at and go from there. Let’s get it on. Camping baby!’</p>
