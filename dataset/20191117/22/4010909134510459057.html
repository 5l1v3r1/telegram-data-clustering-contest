      <h3>LG introduces LG PuriCare Mini portable air purifier</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>With clean air a commodity in high demand today, LG Electronics (LG) recently announced the world’s first filter-type portable air purifier designed for use on-the-go. With an innovative PM1.0 Sensor, the compact and cord-free LG PuriCare Mini helps deliver safe, clean air in the car, a baby’s nursery or even one’s office.</p>
      <p>With LG’s 4-Step Air Filtration System, LG PuriCare Mini can detect and remove 99 percent particulates as small as 0.3 μm1. The first step involves the PM1.0 Sensor which quickly and accurately detects the quality of the air before the Dual Inverter Motor forcibly draws in the air at 5,000rpm in the second step. In step three, the high-efficiency Total Allergen Removal filter removes particulates in the air and in the final step, the powerful Twin Tornado Dual Fan disperses the clean air far and wide. The LG PuriCare Mini is not only highly efficient, it’s also fast, cleaning 50 percent of the air inside a car in 10 minutes.2 </p>
      <p>LG PuriCare Mini can go anywhere the user goes thanks to its small size and light weight, which makes it ideal for use on the go where plug-in models can’t go. Similar in size and weight as a 500-milliliter bottle of water, the wireless portable air purifier freshens the air for up to 8 hours at low speed or 2 hours at the highest setting on battery power alone. And its quiet operation – only 30dB in low setting – allows the LG PuriCare Mini to be used in an enclosed stroller without waking a peacefully sleeping baby. </p>
      <p>PuriCare Mini utilizes a durable filter which lasts up to 2,000 hours or six months if used 12 hours a day. The free LG ThinQ app for both Android and iOS devices allows users to monitor the condition of the filter, check the battery status and control their LG PuriCare Mini via Bluetooth with a smartphone or tablet. The LG PuriCare Mini will become available in key markets of Asia, North America throughout the next several weeks into 2019. No Malaysia release dates or pricing details, but hopefully it arrives soon or at least before the next haze season.</p>

      <p>Lenovo celebrated its month-long celebration in October for Lenovo’s 35th Founding Anniversary in Malaysia with a donation drive which benefited over 400 residents of four charity homes in Klang Valley including the elderly and children. Pusat Penjagaan Kanak-Kanak Cacat Taman Megah, Pusat Jagaan Telaga Kasih Nur Muhammad, Lovely Disabled Home, and Shelter Home for Children had been hand-picked by Lenovo to be the recipient of Lenovo’s donation drive as these homes were in need of additional support. </p>
      <p>Lenovo Malaysia collected and donated daily necessities such as dry food, powdered drinks, cleaning supplies and diapers from generous team members as well as through Lenovo funds allocated for this campaign. The items donations were based on the wishlist provided by each charity home. Pusat Penjagaan Kanak-Kanak Cacat Taman Megah were happy to receive over several bags of diapers which will help them ease their monthly expenditure as diapers are costly purchases.  </p>
      <p>Aside from dropping off the donation items, over 60 Lenovo volunteers also helped to unpack the items. While doing so, the volunteers also spent time with the residents and organizers to learn more about their needs and how Lenovo can continue to support them.  </p>
      <h3>Intel Speeds AI Development, Deployment and Performance with New Class of AI Hardware from Cloud to Edge</h3>
      <p>Intel recently welcomed the next wave of artificial intelligence (AI) with updates on new products designed to accelerate AI system development and deployment from cloud to edge. Intel demonstrated its Intel® Nervana™ Neural Network Processors (NNP) for training (NNP-T1000) and inference (NNP-I1000) — Intel’s first purpose-built ASICs for complex deep learning with incredible scale and efficiency for cloud and data center customers. Intel also revealed its next-generation Intel® Movidius™ Myriad™ Vision Processing Unit (VPU) for edge media, computer vision and inference applications.</p>
      <p>These products further strengthen Intel’s portfolio of AI solutions, which is expected to generate more than $3.5 billion in revenue in 2019. The broadest in breadth and depth in the industry, Intel’s AI portfolio helps customers enable AI model development and deployment at any scale from massive clouds to tiny edge devices, and everything in between.</p>
      <p>The Intel Nervana NNP-T strikes the right balance between compute, communication and memory, allowing near-linear, energy-efficient scaling from small clusters up to the largest pod supercomputers. The Intel Nervana NNP-I is power- and budget-efficient and ideal for running intense, multi-modal inference at real-world scale using flexible form factors. Both products were developed for the AI processing needs of leading-edge AI customers like Baidu and Facebook.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Intel’s next-generation Intel Movidius VPU, scheduled to be available in the first half of 2020, incorporates unique, highly efficient architectural advances that are expected to deliver leading performance—more than 10 times the inference performance as the previous generation—with up to six times the power efficiency of competitor processors. Intel also announced its new Intel® DevCloud for the Edge, which along with the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit, addresses a key pain point for developers—allowing them to try, prototype and test AI solutions on a broad range of Intel processors before they buy hardware.</p>
      <h3>Shell launches Shell Eco-marathon access for Malaysian Students</h3>
      <p>The Shell Eco-marathon is one of the world’s leading energy efficiency competition programmes where students are challenged to design, build and test their energy-efficient cars on track. Recognising the value Shell Eco-marathon offers to students, Shell with the support from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and the Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Education, embarked on Shell Eco-marathon Access (SEM Access), a platform for future participating universities, seasoned teams, alumni and business partners to come together to discuss, design and decide on how to shape the future of energy together. </p>
      <p>SEM Access, which was launched by Y.B. Dr. Ong Kian Ming, Deputy Minister of International Trade and Industry (MITI), provides an avenue for our Malaysian university students to garner investment and mentorship for their participation in SEM Asia through collaborations with corporates and industry players. Students participate in a ‘Make Your Future’ pitch where a panel of business executives listen to their presentations and decide on the teams they want to collaborate with. The corporates and universities then enter into a partnership that provides student teams with the needed support that would enable them to represent the partners and Malaysia in the SEM Asia race.</p>
      <p>Besides the pitching session, four workshops by subject matter experts will be conducted from now till Shell Eco-marathon 2020 in June next year for student teams to upskill and prepare themselves in their pursuit towards designing and building the most energy efficient vehicles and to confidently compete in an international arena.</p>
