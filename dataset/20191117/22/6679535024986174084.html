      <h1>Nirbhaya gangrape: Delhi court admits parents’ plea</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:07:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:07</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>A Delhi Court has admitted a plea filed by the parents of the 2012 gangrape victim seeking transfer of the case to another judge. They have sought a direction to Tihar Jail officials to expedite the execution of the convicts.</p>
      <p>The court will hear the matter on November 25.</p>
      <p>They moved the application since the earlier two judges hearing the matter got transferred and the matter is getting adjourned continuously, the plea said.</p>
      <p>The special fast track court, set up to hear cases of sexual harassment cases exclusively, of Patiala House Court is currently vacant and no judge has been appointed till now.</p>
      <p>The application said that victim’s parents approached the court since the convicts have exhausted all legal remedies.</p>
      <p>In December last year, the parents of Nirbhaya, the 23-old paramedic who was gang-raped in December 2012, approached the court to fast-track the procedure to hang all four convicts in the case.</p>
      <p>Supreme Court on December 12, 2018, dismissed the PIL seeking a direction to the Centre to execute the death penalty awarded to four convicts -- Mukesh, Pawan, Vinay and Akshay -- in the sensational Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case.</p>
      <p>23-year-old paramedic student was gang-raped on December 16, 2012.</p>
      <p>The victim, who was severely assaulted, succumbed to injuries at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore on December 29, where she had been airlifted for medical treatment.</p>
