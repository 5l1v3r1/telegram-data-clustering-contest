      <p>Brown said this year’s gathering will be an opportunity for mining companies and and mining-support industries to affirm their commitment to ensuring mine and environmental safety with the social responsibility to respond to disasters such as the recent Mindanao earthquakes in mind.</p>
      <p>The four-day event will be capped by dinners, welcome night and cocktails, and mining night for guests and participants.</p>

      <p>The first day will be highlighted by a bougainvillea planting activity by members of DIWATA, a non-government organization composed of women in mining advocating the responsible development of the Philippines' wealth in resources.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, there will be one-day sports fest followed by the 5th Yaman PH Student Congress on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The group will also be relaunching the #MineResponsibility, a nationwide information campaign to highlight the economic contribution of mining, as well as the important role played by miners in the conduct of rescue and relief operations in times of disasters.</p>
