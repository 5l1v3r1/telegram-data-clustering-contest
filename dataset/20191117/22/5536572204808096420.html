      <p>The Washington Redskins are trash.</p>
      <p>The latest example of that was a 34-17 loss to the New York Jets, a loss that had gotten so bad that the home fans actually started chanting for team owner Daniel Snyder to “Sell the team! Sell the team!”</p>

      <p>The Redskins team is just bad and the below clip will prove it.</p>
      <p>During the game, Redskins QB Dwayne Haskins went over to his offensive lineman and asked what he needed to do to make them play better.</p>
      <p>The o-line seemed not to care what he was speaking about.</p>
