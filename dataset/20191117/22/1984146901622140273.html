      <p>Australian bush fires have prompted a big change to I'm A Celebrity this year.</p>
      <p>The ITV show returned to our screens on Sunday night, with a lineup including Ian Wright, Nadine Coyle and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/who-caitlyn-jenner-im-celebrity-17271943">Caitlyn Jenner.</a></p>
      <p>The stars were split straight away this year, with them forced <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-power-pairs-17272145">to compete to be 'power pairs'</a> . The winners got to experience relative luxury in the main camp, while across in the 'rough camp' in Snake Rock, the others were forced to survive on basic rations and sleep on the floor.</p>
      <p>One thing both <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> camps have in common is to do with a big change in the cooking. Ant &amp; Dec revealed that due to the bush fires, the camp fire, a huge tradition on the show, wasn't in either camp and instead the celebs have to use gas cookers to make their meals.</p>
      <p>It is the first time in the show's 17 history that there won't be camp fires.</p>
      <p>The campfire, as well as being used for cooking purposes over the years, has also been the scene of a number of arguments - so can we now look forward to spats over the stove?</p>
      <p>At the end of Sunday night's show it was revealed that Caitlyn Jenner and Kate Garraway would face the first Bushtucker Trial, following a public vote.</p>
      <p>Talking about the hardship in the rough camp, Kate said "At the moment, there's a really good team spirit and everyone is very much together. We're a proper team. The Rough Camp team."</p>
