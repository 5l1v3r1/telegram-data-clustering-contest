        <b>Stefanos Tsitsipas capped a dream week at the O2 by beating Dominic Thiem 6-7 (6) 6-2 7-6 (4) to capture the ATP Finals.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/tennis/news/tsitsipas-stuns-federer-in-london/174147">One day after beating Roger Federer</a>, the Greek youngster completed his graduation to the upper echelons of the sport by taking revenge over Thiem, who came from a set down to beat him in Beijing last month.</p>
      <p>It caps a memorable 12 months since he landed the Next Gen title, and now the 21-year-old will have his sights set on the Australian Open, where he reached the semi-finals in January.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas is the youngest winner of the prestigious season-ending tournament since Lleyton Hewitt in 2001, and the youngest debutant to lift the trophy since John McEnroe back in 1978.</p>

      <p>The first set was as tight as the betting had expected it to be, and it took Thiem over an hour to finally edge it on a tie-break he had dominated before the Greek youngster came roaring back.</p>
      <p>Eventually, Thiem sent down an ace to set up a set point which he took on his opponent's serve, but Tsitsipas responded in style with two early breaks as he dominated the second set.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas said: "I was playing with nerves, it's such a big event. I was a break up in the third set, but couldn't hold it, but I'm so relieved with this outstanding performance I gave on the court.</p>
      <p>"It's phenomenal, unbelievable to have such an army behind me, they give me energy, and belief, and I just love that. I would like to thank everyone who supported me with a Greek flags and made me feel at home."</p>
