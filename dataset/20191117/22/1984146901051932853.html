      <p>The I'm A Celebrity producers are known for throwing some pretty cruel tricks on the contestants and they started as they mean to go on with a terrifying first task for this year's campmates.</p>
      <p>Before they'd even gone into the jungle, this year's <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-lineup-confirmed-16118148">I'm A Celebrity lineup,</a> which includes Ian Wright, Nadine Coyle and Caitlyn Jenner, had to face The Planks - set off a building 334ft high!</p>
      <p>Kate Garraway took one look at the plank and said “I don’t know if I can do it.”</p>
      <p>Ian Wright and Jacqueline Jossa  were the first couple to walk the planks and, as the wind started to get stronger, Ian struggled to walk on the plank and nearly fell off <i><b>as you can see in the video above from ITV.</b></i></p>
      <p>The others started to cheer on Jacqueline who said “Ssssh, ssssh please” as she tried to concentrate.</p>
      <p>Both Jacqueline and Ian made their way to the end of the plank and climbed down to the next level.</p>
      <p>Ant said “She’s terrified and doing it.  You have to let go of the ladder and step into the yellow game play zone.”</p>
      <p>Both Ian and Jacqueline managed to complete the task, with Ian declaring “That wind man, the most frightening thing I’ve ever done in my life.”</p>

      <p>Next up was Roman and Myles and, despite the winds, they made rather light work of the planks.</p>
      <p>The final pair to take on the planks were Kate Garraway and Andrew Maxwell, and despite Kate's comments that it was far too windy, both of them managed to complete the task, with the GMB host screaming with joy once back on the roof and hugging Andrew and then Ant and Dec.</p>
      <p>“It was terrifying” said Andrew. Kate added “My legs are like jelly but I nearly screamed to get off there, I thought I just can’t do it.”</p>
      <p>Dec revealed Kate and Andrew’s combined time was 3.39 seconds; Ian and Jacqueline’s combined time was 3.40 seconds and Roman and Myles combined time was 1.45 seconds.</p>
      <p>Dec announced that Roman and Myles were the first power pair. Ant said “So that means you two will be heading into the better camp and you’ll enjoy your first meal.”</p>
      <p>Dec added “The rest of you aren’t so lucky, unfortunately you’ll be sleeping on the floor, eating rice and beans in the rough camp.”</p>
