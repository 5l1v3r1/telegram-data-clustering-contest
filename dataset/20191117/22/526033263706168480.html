      <p>"Patty was not only a colleague of mine, but she was also my mentor and one of my best friends," Sarah Ludwig-Ross, the founder and head of the school, told ABC News in a statement last week. "She was one of the most caring people I have ever met, always putting everyone else first."</p>
      <p>"She shared our belief that peace in the world can only come from getting close to and understanding people who are different from ourselves. ... Patty loved each and every one of our children just as if they were her own," she added.</p>
      <p>Anton's family described her as a loving woman who "was all about kindness and sweetness."</p>

      <p>"Her life was so much bigger than her death," her cousin, Adrianne Machina, told ABC News on Thursday. "The Dominican Republic was her happy place. I think her dream was to retire down there. â€¦ The Dominican Republic really gave her purpose and peace."</p>
      <p>The family said it was working with officials at 3 Mariposas Montessori to erect a "peace park" in Anton's honor.</p>
