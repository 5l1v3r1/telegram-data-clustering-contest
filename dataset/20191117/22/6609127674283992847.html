      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14921/motherwell/">Motherwell</a> defender opened up on his long-awaited Scotland debut in Cyprus.</p>
      <p>Gallagher, 28, was overcome with emotion as his proud family watched on at the GSP stadium in Nicosia.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> kid is a late developer and admits pulling on the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/298595/scotland-football-team/">Scotland</a> strip meant everything to him.</p>
      <p>He said: “My mum and dad, my wife and my little girl, and my wife’s mum and dad were all over.</p>

      <p>“They’d been over since Monday so it was like a holiday for them. It was good they were there to see me get my first cap.</p>
      <p>“I said to my wife that it was special. I texted her saying I felt like crying knowing that her and my little girl were there to see me get my first cap.</p>
      <p>“It was amazing. My mum and dad were over in Russia too when I was in the squad. They go everywhere, they never miss a game.</p>
      <p>“They were happy going with the Tartan Army into Moscow and just basically drank a few bars dry.</p>
      <p>“They were happy with that but it’s definitely a reward that they got to see me play in Cyprus.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big achievement for me and my family because they are the rock behind me. It was great as much for them as it was for me.</p>
      <p>“There was also a wee round of applause at the end of the game back in the dressing room.</p>
      <p>“The boys gave a round of applause for Steven Naismith getting 50 caps and for me getting my first. It was a special moment for me.”</p>

      <p>Gallagher has had a long road to the Scotland squad, coming through dark times in his personal life.</p>
      <p>He was jailed for assault in 2015 and has previously thanked <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/362848/livingston/">Livingston</a> for standing by him.</p>
      <p>Playing for Scotland would have seemed a dream back then but he has managed to rebuild his career.</p>
      <p>Now he wants to cement his place in the national side, just like his early mentors at Celtic did.</p>
      <p>He said: “I looked up to the likes of Gary Caldwell and Stephen McManus, they were absolutely excellent.</p>
      <p>“I was in the youth team at Celtic when I was watching them. I saw them in training and it was great.</p>
      <p>“I want to be like that, be in the Scotland set-up all the time and hopefully I’ve done enough to do that. I owe thanks to everybody that has worked with me.</p>
      <p>“Livingston were a big part of it and Stephen Robinson has pushed me massively. He’s pushed me on and off the park and he is always pushing me in the press.</p>

      <p>“I owe a massive thanks to him and the backroom staff at Motherwell because they push me non-stop.</p>
      <p>“They probably deserve as much credit as I do for getting into the Scotland squad.”</p>
      <p>Gallagher got the nod ahead of Mikey Devlin and Ryan Porteous to play beside Scott McKenna.</p>
      <p>He thanked Steve Clarke for showing faith in him and hopes to keep his place for the clash with Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>He said: “Once I got my breath, I enjoyed it. I found out I was starting the night before the game.</p>
      <p>“We had a team meeting and the gaffer likes to prepare the boys.</p>
      <p>“It’s just to get any nervousness out of your head so you know you’re playing and you can focus on your game.</p>
      <p>“I think nerves are a big part of the game. If you aren’t nervous it means you have no emotions.</p>

      <p>“It’s a European qualifier and my first cap so it’s a big moment in my career.</p>
      <p>“It’s good to be nervous at the start, but as soon as the whistle goes that all goes out the window and you focus on the game.</p>
      <p>“All I can do is take my chance and hopefully I’ve done enough to get another cap.</p>
      <p>"But there are a lot of good players out injured just now and a lot of good players in the squad so I just have to keep doing well.</p>
      <p>“Cyprus played some good football but I felt we were comfortable. I was delighted with the win on my debut.</p>
      <p>“It’s up to the manager what he does on Tuesday. He might want to freshen it up. I just need to keep working hard in training and see where it takes us.”</p>
      <p>Gallagher will head back to Motherwell later this week and hopes boss Robinson will be there to greet him.</p>
      <p>The Fir Park gaffer remains in the frame for the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14918/hearts/">Hearts</a> and Northern Ireland jobs but the Scotland man doesn’t want to lose him.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’ve texted him a few things, saying ‘don’t think you’re going anywhere’ and stuff like that.</p>
      <p>“To be fair, he deserves it. He’s an incredible manager and for me one of the best in Scotland.</p>
      <p>“His attention to detail is magnificent and he deserves to go to the very top.</p>
      <p>“Now I’ve been there and done it he is going to push me to stay there and keep going up and up. Hopefully that’s what I can do.”</p>
