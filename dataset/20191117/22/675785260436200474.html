      <p>Two I'm A Celebrity contestants were picked to face the first Bushtucker trial of the 2019 I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! competition.</p>
      <p>The public whittled down the contestants to Kate Garraway and Caitlyn Jenner to be the first to face a challenge called Bugged Off.</p>
      <p>As the launch episode of the show reached a conclusion, show hosts Ant and Dec broke news to the camp that someone would be facing a trial.</p>
      <p>And after revealing Caitlyn could face a trail, Kate gasped when she realised she was the last to be named - meaning she could also be in the line of bad luck.</p>
