      <p>The Police Command in Enugu State has smashed a gang of notorious armed robbers that usually operates within Udi/Agbudu/Ozalla Road axis of Udi Local Government Area.</p>
      <p>The Command’s Public Relations Officer, SP Ebere Amaraizu, said in a statement on Sunday that the gang was smashed in the early hours of Sunday along the road.</p>
      <p>Amaraizu said that the feat was achieved by men of Operation Puff Adder of the Udi Division of the Command acting on well-gathered and coordinated intelligence information.</p>
      <p>“It was gathered that the suspected hoodlums had allegedly blocked the road with woods and other items; and were already in their nefarious activities when police operatives ran into the road block mounted by the suspected hoodlums.</p>
      <p>“It was further gathered that the suspected hoodlums had engaged the operatives in a gun duel but were overpowered by the operatives who later got one of them critically wounded and who was later confirmed dead.</p>
      <p>“After the encounter, the operatives started combing the bush and later arrested three of the suspected hoodlums,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>Amaraizu said that the state Commissioner of Police, Ahmad Abdurrahman, had directed a full scale investigation into the incident.</p>
      <p>“The suspects have been helping police operatives in their investigation so far,’’ he said. </p>
