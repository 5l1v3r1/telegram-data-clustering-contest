      <h2>Reds fans may have been worried when the star forward failed to take to the pitch for the second-half of Senegal's victory over Eswatini but it was a tactical decision</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:49:46+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:49</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool supporters can breathe a sigh of relief with the news that Sadio Mane's substitution for Senegal during their 4-1 win over Eswatini was not because he was injured.</p>
      <p>Mane has been one of Jurgen Klopp's most important players so far this season, with the 27-year-old scoring 11 goals and creating two assists in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Although he started the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier he was substituted at half-time, with some fearing it was because he had picked up a knock.</p>
      <p>It was later revealed, however, that he was taken off due to a worry he would be sent off. Mane was booked in the first-half and appeared frustrated after being fouled on a number of occasions.</p>

      <p>Manager Aliou Cisse therefore decided the best thing to do was to replace him so the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> man could cool down and not pick up a suspension for future matches.</p>
      <p>Mane should therefore be in line to start Liverpool's game against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday, which will come as a huge relief to manager Jurgen Klopp, who is dealing with a number of issues following the international break.</p>
      <p>Mohamed Salah, Joe Gomez, Jordan Henderson, Virgil Van Dijk and Andy Robertson all withdrew from international duty, and are all possible doubts for the game at Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>The most concerning may be Robertson, who admitted he had been dealing with a niggling ankle injury for a number of weeks.</p>

      <p>"For the last two and a half weeks, I've not trained at all for Liverpool," he revealed after pulling out of the Scotland squad.</p>
      <p>"It's a niggling injury which won't go away unless I give it time."</p>
      <p>The Reds will be looking to maintain an eight point lead at the top of the Premier League table, but may have to do so without some of their key players.</p>
