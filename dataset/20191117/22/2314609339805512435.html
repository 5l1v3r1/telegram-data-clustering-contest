      <h1>'No loyalty': WA consumers the real winners in the gas wars, but discounts wont last forever</h1>

      <p>South eastern suburbs resident Karen Riley’s loyalty lies only with her wallet when it comes to her gas bill.</p>
      <p>Like many other Western Australian’s the Ferndale resident is taking full advantage of the discounting that is occurring as gas retailers duke it out in an increasingly busy market, but the state’s biggest and oldest provider has warned that discounting has probably peaked.</p>

      <p>Ms Riley was with Alinta Energy for five years before switching to eastern states entrant AGL, who approached her with a sizeable discount for senior’s cardholders about a year ago.</p>
      <p>“I don’t have any particular loyalty, I just go with the best option at the time,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I’m just dollar conscious because I’m on a fairly low income these days, I’m only working a few days a week and I shop for the bargains now. Gas is really easy.”</p>
      <p>WA’s gas market was first opened to competition in 2004 but it wasn’t until Kleenheat launched its service in 2013 that things started heating up.</p>
      <p>The Economic Regulation Authority regulates the gas market and chair Nicky Cusworth said in the past six years the market had grown to six players.</p>
      <p>This has eroded Alinta’s market share from 96.7 per cent to 63.2 per cent in 2018-19 but Ms Cusworth said only around half of all small use customers had switched retailers or negotiated a better offer with their existing retailer.</p>
      <p>“Those customers who have not switched or spoken to their retailer about getting a better deal have a real opportunity to lower their gas bills,” she said.</p>
      <p>Most companies are offering at least 35 per cent off gas bills under certain conditions, according to consumer information site <a href="https://www.canstarblue.com.au/gas/natural-gas-suppliers-wa/">Canstar Blue</a>.</p>
      <p>The time of flat cash discounts may have reached their limit however with companies offering other perks such as streaming service subscriptions or more abstract offers such as Alinta’s five hours free usage of a removalist truck for new and existing customers.</p>

      <p>Alinta Energy WA general manager Chris Campbell believed the ‘busy’ market was at stretching point and he predicted discounting may have peaked.</p>
      <p>“We’re seeing discounts obviously very heavily happening and good competitive offers for customers, but we feel like its peaking out,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Different players have been more aggressive than others and you might see some continue to push ahead while others might pull back.</p>

      <p>“We think that underlying cost structures will probably go up from here and so the opportunities for further discounting are probably pretty minimal.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been exploring ways how we can deliver value to customers in another way and this moving truck offer and initiative is really one of those ways we’ve had a look and thought, ‘why shouldn’t we do this?’”</p>
      <p>Mr Campbell said WA’s gas market is much smaller than the east coast and a lack of competition in the electricity market meant consumers couldn’t bundle their energy together, which was turning off other retailers from setting up shop in WA.</p>
