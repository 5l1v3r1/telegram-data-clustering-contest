      <h2>The TV chef parted with a large amount of money to ensure his daughter had a party to remember</h2>

      <p>Gordon Ramsay reportedly 'spent £500,000' on the entertainment for daughter Tilly's 18th birthday bash last week.</p>
      <p>The TV chef, 53, paid the massive amount to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> so that he would perform for Tilly's milestone birthday as the Shape of You hitmaker is her favourite artist.</p>
      <p>“Tilly’s bash was next level. It was clear Gordon had spared no expense in making sure it really was a night to remember,' a party insider told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10364613/gordon-ramsay-tilly-ed-sheeran-18/">The Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>“Ed is Tilly’s favourite singer so it meant the world to her that he was there, even though his set didn’t come cheap.</p>

      <p>“The whole party had a James Bond theme, with drinks topped with her face or the 007 logo and guests encouraged to come in black tie. There was even a 007 ice sculpture which you could drink shots out of.”</p>
      <p>The publication also claim that it cost Gordon a whopping £500,000 to get the red-haired musician on board for the intimate gig.</p>
      <p>Tilly's birthday party came after she risked the wrath of the sweary chef when she went public with her new boyfriend on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> earlier this month.</p>
      <p>She shared two sweet black and white photos with an unnamed boy as they did some sightseeing in South Africa.</p>
      <p>In one photo they pose with their arms around each other, and in the next Tilly, a budding chef herself, looked giggly as she nestled in close.</p>

      <p>Her post shocked her famous dad, who wrote "WTF" in the Instagram comments.</p>
      <p>Tilly's brother Jack had anticipated their father's reaction, writing: "@gordongram interrogation time."</p>
      <p>Their sister Megan joined in, saying: "We have all been there Tills - gotta face up to it."</p>
      <p>One person commented asking if the boy was Tilly's boyfriend and she said "maybe".</p>
      <p>No wonder it comes as a surprise to Gordon, who just weeks ago revealed that Tilly is dating Gino D'Acampo's son Luciano.</p>
      <p>He said Tilly, who has her own CBBC show Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch, grew close to Gino's boy, 17, while their dads were filming new TV show Men Behaving Badly.</p>
      <p>Gordon shared news of his daughter romance's with the offspring of his pal Gino, 43, during an appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show.</p>

      <p>When he was asked about rumours the teenagers had grown close, famously foul-mouthed Gordon described the situation as a "f***ing nightmare".</p>
      <p>Gordon said: "We were driving through San Francisco and FaceTiming Luciano, and all of a sudden Tilly pops up behind them, and they are out having lunch.</p>
      <p>"I think they are friends."</p>
