      <p>TOWN OF UNION (WBNG) — The Maine-Endwell field hockey team won their second straight Class A state championship on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Taking on Horace Greeley, the Spartans scored with thirteen minutes left in the first half on a penalty corner. Anna Castaldo scored the second goal of the game with time winding down in the first.</p>
      <p>The team had a warm welcome back to Maine-Endwell, topped off with a victory parade with family and friends.</p>
      <p>“This is a good group. They worked really extremely hard offseason, they’re just really talented. They pull it together and it’s not always easy, bu they are a group who worked really hard and they deserve both these state titles,” said coach Heather Doyle.</p>
