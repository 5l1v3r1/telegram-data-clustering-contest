      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> was left stumped when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…Get Me Out Of Here! kicked off as she met some of the celebrities she will be living with for the next three weeks.</p>
      <p>The reality TV star, who has famous kids Kylie and Kendall Jenner and four Kardashian step-children, got to know radio DJs <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> Roberts, soap star Jacqueline Jossa and comedian Andrew Maxwell.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old cheerily greeted everyone when she arrived by speedboat to a beach, who in turn introduced themselves to her.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline got to the point by saying: ‘You have no clue who anyone is.’</p>
      <p>She confessed: ‘No I don’t but we’re gonna have a lot of time to talk.’</p>
      <p>The celebrities were thrown in at the deep straight away with Caitlyn having to take on a skydive.</p>

      <p>She was more than ready for it, as the rest of her famous family – the Kardashian-Jenners – have all skydived before.</p>
      <p>She joked: ‘I’m a pilot and flown for 45 years but I’ve never jumped out of one. Everyone has always asked me over the years, “have you ever jumped?” and I’ve always said “no” because my plane has always worked.</p>

      <p>‘Kendall has skydived, Kim has and I think Kourtney has. I’m gonna do this, everyone in my family has done it.’</p>
      <p>Dec revealed that Caitlyn and partner James Haskell managed to retrieve their tokens in eight minutes and 8 seconds, however they lost to Adele and Nadine who got theirs in five minutes and 21 seconds.</p>
      <p>After the challenge was over, they joined Ian Wright, Jacqueline Jossa, Kate Garraway and Andrew Maxwell were sent to Snake Rock where they awaited their feast of beans and rice.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline was horrified to see that there were no beds and they would be sleeping on the ground.</p>
      <p>But Caitlyn wanted to make the best of it, telling the other celebs: ‘We’ve had to straighten our camp up, kind of find out what everything is at and go from there. Let’s get it on. Camping baby!’</p>
