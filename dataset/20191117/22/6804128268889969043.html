      <h1>Jody Morris has an amazing message for Chelsea trio Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori</h1>
      <h2>Chelsea's assistant manager has taken to social media to send a message to several Blues stars after England's latest win</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Warlow</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea's England contingent have had a pretty good week on international duty.</p>
      <p>From Tammy Abraham scoring his first England goal on Thursday night against Montenegro to Mason Mount celebrating his first goal in a 4-0 win against Kosovo this evening (Sunday), the <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> stars playing for the Three Lions have enjoyed some good moments.</p>
      <p>Add to that an England debut for Fikayo Tomori, who came off the bench in Pristina tonight - and a third cap for Callum Hudson-Odoi - and the young Blues have plenty to cheer, with the Three Lions celebrating qualification for next summer's European Championships in style.</p>
      <p>The Chelsea quartet will now return to the Blues' training ground at Cobham ahead of the Premier League clash with Manchester City next weekend.</p>
      <p>And ahead of their return, Chelsea assistant manager Jody Morris has sent a message to three of the Blues stars after their exploits for England this week.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter following England's 4-0 win against Kosovo, Morris has posted the following message, together with a blue heart.</p>
      <p>"What a week for the boys <a href="https://twitter.com/tammyabraham">@tammyabraham</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/masonmount_10">@masonmount_10</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/fikayotomori_">@fikayotomori_</a> very proud of all 3...you deserve it lads."</p>
      <p>The post has already been liked by more than 4,000 people.</p>
