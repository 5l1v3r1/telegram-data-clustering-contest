      <p>Two I'm A Celebrity contestants were picked to face the first Bushtucker trial of the 2019 I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! competition.</p>
      <p>The public whittled down the contestants to Kate Garraway and Caitlyn Jenner to be the first to face a challenge called Bugged Off.</p>
      <p>As the launch episode of the show reached a conclusion, show hosts Ant and Dec broke news to the camp that someone would be facing a trial.</p>
      <p>And after revealing Caitlyn could face a trail, Kate gasped when she realised she was the last to be named - meaning she could also be in the line of bad luck.</p>

      <p>Usually, one person will face a trial, but Ant and Dec hammed up the tension by revealing both women would face the challenge.</p>
      <p>Following the reveal that Caitlyn would be one half of the trial pair, viewers took to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to joke that her ex wife may have been behind the result of the public vote.</p>
      <p>Memes and gifs galore flooded the social media site with images of Kris Jenner (who Caitlyn was married to between 1991 and 2015 and they share two daughters) repeatedly hitting a laptop.</p>

      <p>Another fan tweeted: "Kris, we know you’re rich but how many phones did you have to buy to vote for Caitlyn to do tomorrow’s trial?"</p>
      <p>Other fans feared that it could be the beginning of a trend for the 2019 competition.</p>
      <p>"Caitlyn is gonna get picked for every trial isn’t she?" one fan wrote on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Earlier in the episode, viewers watched rugby superstar James Haskell and Radio 1 star Adele Roberts rummage through insect filled boxes to complete another task.</p>
      <p>James revealed he had a fear of bugs as he was covered by ants during the task.</p>
      <p>While Adele screamed throughout the challenge as she received tokens from boxes - but was rewarded when she won the task.</p>
