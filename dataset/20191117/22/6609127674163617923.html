      <p>The miserable mantra of the perennial non-achiever, a holding pen for the hopeless.</p>

      <p>Or, as they’re better known round these parts, the SFA.</p>
      <p>An organisation who couldn’t pre-empt rain in November by carrying a brolly, never mind plan ahead to help the national team end a spirit-sapping cycle of failure.</p>
      <p>Witness the emergence from his bunker on Saturday of President Petrie, ’tache bristling like Trigger’s brush, to announce a revolutionary plan: He’ll be demanding that <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/298595/scotland-football-team/">Steve Clarke’s players</a> get the weekend off from SPFL matches before the Euro 2020 play-offs in March.</p>
      <p>Well, not so much ‘demanding’ as ‘suggesting’. Not so much right now as once Sky and BT have announced their live springtime fixtures.</p>

      <p>And all the while tip-toeing around on eggshells until the time’s right to ask the question of those who’ll make the decision.</p>
      <p>The fact that in addressing the media he was, in fact, asking the question whether the time was right or not, appeared to escape his thought process.</p>
      <p>The fact that the SPFL almost instantly told him to go and play with the buses was as big a surprise as Steven Fletcher not being available to play in Nicosia.</p>
      <p>But that’s how “desperate” — Petrie’s word, not mine — the Blazers are to get us to next summer’s finals.</p>
      <p>So desperate they don’t utter a word about something this pivotal until the eve of our last two group games, once key men are pulling out left, right and centre and self-esteem’s through the floor.</p>
      <p>Whereas if they really, really cared — as in, even half as much as the Tartan Army foot soldier who plans his life around away games; or as a boy like John McGinn who swears he’d “need to be on crutches” to miss a cap — they’d have had all this in place before a ball was kicked.</p>
      <p>They knew from before the Nations League campaign, never mind the 2020 qualifiers proper, that we could be in these play-offs.</p>
      <p>Bloody hell, the whole Consolation Cup concept was concocted to make sure nearly-nations like us were in these play-offs.</p>

      <p>The format was announced in December 2014. The draw for our Nations League group was made in January 2018.</p>
      <p>Any point between those two dates would have been the right time for the SFA to decide how best to facilitate our progress to the finals.</p>
      <p>A week’s break before a potential March 2020 play-off should have been set in stone long, long ago.</p>
      <p>Then again, the SFA find it hard enough to decide where the team’s going to play or who’s going to manage them long enough to see out a full set of qualifiers.</p>
      <p>So what chance them having a spare half-hour on the schedule to discuss trifling side issues like how we make sure our best 11 footballers are on the park when it matters most?</p>
      <p>Look at our record on managers.</p>
      <p>Since the end of Craig Brown’s reign in 2002, we’ve binned Berti Vogts, Craig Burley, Craig Levein and Alex McLeish off the back of poor starts to campaigns, each time leaving the next guy off the rank without the time or the momentum to repair the damage.</p>
      <p>The lack of joined-up thinking is quite astonishing.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>In each of these four cases, it was blindingly obvious to the fans, the players, the media, the Hampden tea lady and dugs in the street that the plug should have been pulled months earlier.</p>
      <p>Yet each time, the SFA gave it their best ostrich impression until yet another chance to at least come close to reaching a finals through the front door was out of reach.</p>
      <p>The only saving grace with Euro 2020 is that we can still get in through the back door. Yet even then, look at the chain of events that brought us to where we are right now.</p>
      <p>They let Gordon Strachan’s contract run down when he still had a huge amount to offer, made a huge public deal of going after Michael O’Neill, were left affronted when he chose to stay with Northern Ireland, then ended up bringing Big Eck back in what for all the world felt like in-house horse-trading; previous President Alan McRae gets his “really good pal” a job in return for key committee members getting the Chief Executive they wanted in Ian Maxwell.</p>
      <p>If all this was in the best interests of the team, that first Cyprus goal on Saturday was never over the line.</p>
      <p>This is how they operate, though, in an abstract world of internal politics and the occasional social media-led unveiling of a new kit.</p>
      <p>They ride the coat-tails of our women’s team reaching a World Cup and promise it’ll change everything forever, yet five months later it’s like it never happened.</p>
      <p>As I’m writing this, the SPFL’s statement on Petrie’s — ahem — demands has just dropped.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It says that they’d love to help, they’re right behind Stevie and the boys, but they’re kinda busy. So tough cheese, matey.</p>
      <p>In other words, you might have the blazer but we have the clout.</p>
      <p>I’m not even going to sit here and cane the reaction of Neil Doncaster and the Old Firm bosses who pull his strings.</p>
      <p>They might be self-interested, self-centred, arrogant sods, but at least their first thought in every decision they make is to look after their own.</p>
      <p>Whereas the SFA’s blazers merely look after themselves.</p>
      <p>Petrie presumably spoke out in Cyprus because someone told him he’d better make some sort of reaction to public anger at the likes of Ryan Fraser and Kieran Tierney getting to skip duty on the say-so of their clubs rather than of Steve Clarke’s medical team.</p>
      <p>Which, push comes to shove, is all the SFA ever do — react.</p>
      <p>They’re never ahead of the game, never have a Plan B, they’re terrified of confrontation and of change.</p>
      <p>Their lack of a cohesive, sustainable plan for the game at every level is the prime reason for 21 years of failure at international level.</p>
      <p>I’ve said it a thousand times before and I’ll say it again.</p>
      <p>If we were starting Scottish football over from scratch tomorrow, there’s barely one shred of how this mob works we would choose to copy.</p>
      <p>And, believe me, we need to start Scottish football from scratch. Today.</p>
      <p>WEE John McGinn has the backside of a footballing Kardashian.</p>
      <p>Ryan Christie has a left foot like a stage magician’s wand.</p>
      <p>Put the two together on a strange old November’s afternoon and — shazam! — special things happen.</p>
      <p>You’re out your seat, punching the air, believing that this is how it should always be.</p>
      <p>Moments like these are what keep you coming back to Scotland.</p>
      <p>McGinn uses that rear of the year to lever himself away from a marker, spins into space and sprays the pass wide.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Christie cuts inside, moves the ball from foot to foot, gets his body in perfect shape and arcs a shot three keepers glued together couldn’t get near.</p>
      <p>We’re good at this, are Scotland.</p>
      <p>No matter how mediocre we might have been for way too long, we have a record of producing the kind of goals the Belgians or Brazilians would be proud of.</p>
      <p>Shaun Maloney’s winner against Ireland at Parkhead, Matt Ritchie’s screamer against Poland at Hampden, Ikechi Anya in Dortmund, the free-kicks from Leigh Griffiths to stun the English.</p>
      <p>Faddy in Paris, for goodness sake, Faddy in Paris.</p>
      <p>If we could bottle whatever it is that flows through our veins in those seconds of inspiration and innovation and spread it throughout the team, the tactics, the attitude, we’d be miles up those Fifa rankings right now.</p>
      <p>Yet it’s forever the basics that let us down.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Poor marking at set-pieces, not tracking runs off the ball, lack of communication, we’ve seen them all way too often in this campaign and too many more before.</p>
      <p>Take the equaliser we gave away on Saturday. Yes, it was a wonder strike from Georgios Efrem, but we still brought it on ourselves.</p>
      <p>When the ball’s 25 yards from goal, there’s no need for Scott McKenna to go through the back of his man, but he does anyway.</p>
      <p>And giving away stick-on free-kicks in enticing areas, you invite trouble. That’s us all over right now.</p>
      <p>From middle to front we can be as good as anyone, yet too much of the creative stuff is negated by the kind of poor decision-making that wouldn’t be acceptable in League Two never mind international level.</p>
      <p>Until we sort that out, we’ll always be our own toughest opponent.</p>
