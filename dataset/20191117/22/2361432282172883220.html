      <h1>Kanye West Says He's 'the Greatest Artist That God Has Ever Created'</h1>
      <h2>Rapper spoke to 16,000 parishioners at Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church in Houston Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:39:15+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/rosemary-rossi/" target="_blank">Rosemary Rossi</a></address>
      <p>Kanye West addressed a packed house of parishioners at Joel Osteen’s megachurch in Houston, Texas on Sunday, affirming his dedication to Christianity and calling himself “the greatest artist that God has ever created,” according to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/11/17/kanye-west-rants-sinning-christianity-joel-osteen-service/4223134002/">USA Today</a>.</p>
      <p>The rapper told the crowd of about 16,000 at Lakewood Church that the “devil stole all the good producers, all the good musicians, all the good artists, all the good designers,” but that a shift was coming because “now, the greatest artist that God has ever created is working for him.” He was referencing himself, USA Today wrote.</p>
      <p>“I know that God has been calling me for a long time and the devil has been distracting me for a long time,” West told Osteen during a 20-minute interview on stage.</p>

      <p>The “Jesus Is King” artist shared details of a low point in his life in 2016 when he was hospitalized after a “mental breakdown,” saying God “was there with me, sending me visions, inspiring me,” adding that rappers are distracted by alcohol, promiscuity and other “addictions” that “bring our Christian scorecard down.”</p>
      <p>Oh, and about that rumor that he’ll be running for President of the United States in 2024, West said, “I’m not going to run, I’m going to walk.”</p>
      <p>Last weekend, West took his “Jesus Is King” tour on an unexpected stop in <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-houston-prisons-video/">two Houston prisons</a> where he performed tracks from his gospel album. Last month, he released the album along with a short film featuring him and his Sunday Service gospel choir that screened in <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-box-office/">IMAX theaters, selling out screenings</a> in 24 cities worldwide.</p>

          <figcaption>It's been a crazy year for Kanye West. First he spent months commenting on contentious issues like the 13th Amendment and expressing support for President Trump. Then he ended October 2018 with a near-total reversal, renouncing politics as well as <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/kanye-west-renounces-politics-ive-used-spread-messages-dont-believe/">certain unnamed persons he said "used" him</a>.<br/>But that's just par for the course for the rapper, who has a long history of stirring things up, politically speaking. Let's review 13 times Kanye West fanned the flames of political strife.</figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"I would have voted for Trump" – Nov. 2016 <br/></b><br/>Nearly 11 years after denouncing George W. Bush, Kanye got political again, this time by expressing support for Donald Trump during a 24-minute interlude at the San Jose stop on his Saint Pablo Tour. "He wasn’t even in politics and he won," West told a crowd of confused concertgoers. "That shows you the level of possibility that’s out there," said Yeezy to plenty of boos. Of course, the rapper didn't actually vote that year, he just said <i>he would have</i> voted for Trump if he <i>had</i> voted. Maybe Trump will return the favor if Ye actually ends up running <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/kanye-west-pushes-back-presidential-bid-4-years-trump-meeting/">for president in 2024.</a><cite>Getty Images</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Blexit" Drama – Oct. 2018<br/></b>On Oct. 27 at a conservative conference, pro-Trump activist Candace Owens unveiled merch for her self-styled “Blexit” campaign, urging black voters to abandon the Democratic Party. Owens took pains to strongly associate Kanye with the campaign, <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/413527-kanye-west-t-shirts-urge-black-people-to-leave-democratic-party">telling Page Six</a> that he designed the campaign's X-shaped stick figure logo, and stating that the rapper was at the conference "in spirit." But maybe not: Just two days later, Owens <a href="https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1056921709708824577">clarified in a statement on Twitter</a> that West only designed the logo, and is not otherwise involved in the campaign.<br/><br/>That wasn't the end of it, however...<cite>ABC/Blexit</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>Kanye Renounces Politics -- Oct. 2018<br/><br/>On Oct. 30, West categorically denied any involvement in "Blexit" at all, <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1057382888520499201">tweeting,</a> "I introduced Candace to the person who made the logo and they didn’t want their name on it so she used mine. I never wanted any association with Blexit. I have nothing to do with it." <br/><br/>Then in <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1057382916760707072">a follow up tweet</a>, Ye renounced politics -- and certain unnamed people -- entirely.  "My eyes are now wide open and now realize I've been used to spread messages I don't believe in," he said. <br/><br/>But has Kanye West's political flame-fanning finally come to an end? Only time will tell.<cite>Twitter</cite></figcaption>
