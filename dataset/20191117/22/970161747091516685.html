      <p>The brother of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/26/mum-says-just-existing-daughter-disappeared-three-months-ago-9692342/">Leah Croucher</a>, a young woman who has been missing since February, has died suddenly.</p>
      <p>Haydon Croucher, 24, had been involved in the search for his younger sister, who was last seen in Buzzacott Lane in Furzton, Milton Keynes on Friday 15th February.</p>
      <p>His death was confirmed by dad John Croucher on Facebook, who wrote: ‘Be at peace Haydon. If Leah is up there with you look after each other as always, until we get there.’</p>
      <p>The circumstances in which Haydon passed away remain unknown, but his father claimed he died in hospital after police knocked on their door to tell them he was ‘fighting for his life’.</p>
      <p>Mr Croucher wrote: ‘What kind of life is it that you can speak to your son on Thursday evening to reassure him that we all feel the same sadness at Friday 15th, approaching nine months with no news about Leah is a terrible thing to face.</p>

      <p>‘We promise to meet up the following day so we can face it together.</p>
      <p>‘Hours later police knock at the door and tell you that Haydon is fighting for his life.</p>

      <p>‘The doctors say the prognosis is bad. You sit by his bedside and watch him deteriorate by the minute.</p>
      <p>‘You have to say your goodbyes. What do you say in that situation?</p>
      <p>‘You tell him you love him. You reminisce about funnier times. You beg him to come back to us.</p>
      <p>‘Finally you have to tell him to go and be at peace. You hold him as he slips away.</p>
      <p>‘To say our hearts and minds are broken is an understatement.</p>
      <p>‘Haydon was a kind, generous, funny, witty and loving person and in his words an amazingly good looking bloke. He had a huge heart.</p>
      <p>‘He was only 24. Too young to be gone forever.</p>

      <p>‘He has left behind two families and friends that loved him dearly.</p>
      <p>‘We will all miss him. Always.</p>
      <p>‘Be at peace Haydon. If Leah is up there with you look after each other as always, until we get there.</p>
      <p>‘We love and miss you both terribly. Our world could not be more broken than it is now.’</p>

      <p>Haydon had appeared at Aylesbury Crown Court accused of threatening a man who had dated his sister before he died.</p>
      <p>He received a restraining order and the case was dropped.</p>
      <p>In court, Judge Francis Sheridan told him: ‘This is a real tragedy. You and your family are entitled to and deserve our utter sympathy.’</p>

      <p>Leah, 20, and Haydon’s parents said in an interview that they believe their daughter may have been murdered.</p>
      <p>She went missing from her home in Quantock Crescent, Emerson Valley on Friday 15th February this year.</p>
      <p>Leah, who had not told her parents where she had been for 75 minutes on Valentine’s night, was last seen just after 8.15pm walking towards work in the direction of Loxbeare Drive and Chaffron Way.</p>
      <p>Her mobile phone and bank account have not been used since.</p>
      <p>Three witnesses reported that a female that could possibly have been Leah was seen by Furzton Lake on 15 February, between 9.30am and 11.15am.</p>
      <p>They claimed she seemed ‘angry, upset and crying’.</p>
      <p>A search of the lake was carried out but nothing was found.</p>
