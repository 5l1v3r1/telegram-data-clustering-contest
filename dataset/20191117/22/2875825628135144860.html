      <h1>Secret 12th I'm A Celebrity star confirmed as EastEnders star Cliff Parisi</h1>
      <h2>The 59-year-old actor, best known as the lovable Minty by soap fans, will be heading Down Under as one of this year's late arrivals on I'm A Celebrity</h2>

      <p>EastEnders and Call The Midwife actor Cliff Parisi is the final name heading into the I'm A Celebrity jungle.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old is known to millions as 'Minty' from his eight years on Albert Square and also now as handyman and gardener Fred Buckle on Call The Midwife.</p>
      <p>He will enter the show at the end of the week alongside Coronation Street's Andy Whyment and bosses think he will provide some laughs as he does not take himself too seriously and was once a stand up comic when he started out.</p>
      <p>In an interview Cliff recalled: “In those days you needed an equity card and there were only a few ways of doing it juggling, stripping or being funny. I was no good at juggling and no one was interested in me stripping.”</p>
      <p>ITV bosses are hoping the two soap stars will provide the show with a boost a few days into the series. Last year there was much hype around the late entrant – TV host Noel Edmonds. But he found himself being the first person kicked out just days later.</p>

      <p>An ITV source said: “With Cliff and Andy we have got too big soap names joining the jungle and they'll be a lot of fun</p>
      <p>“Cliff is the final piece in the puzzle and comes from two massive BBC shows. It will be interesting to see if he sees the funny side of things when he has been in there a while and the hunger and tiredness kicks in.”</p>

      <p>Cliff grew up in north London and is married to BBC production assistant Tara Wyer.</p>
      <p>He has previously spoken of how his school days were tough, because he was dyslexic but dis­­missed as “thick” and he left at 13.</p>

      <p>Unable to follow his dream of attending stage school because he lacked the necessary qualifications, Cliff became a stand-up comic.</p>
      <p>By the mid-80s he had become successful enough to get an Equity card and that was his passport into acting which was his career of choice.</p>
      <p>He was offered a bit-part in the 1989 film Queen of Hearts then landed the role of Lunchbox in the TV series Chancer.</p>
      <p>He also appeared in The Darling Buds of May and Drop the Dead Donkey and landed bigger parts in Kavanagh QC, Bramwell and A Prince Among Men before being cast as Minty in EastEnders in 2002. The actor has four children – daughter Mandy, 37, and sons Dean, 31, and Jack 27, are from previous relationships. Tara gave birth to Cliff’s fourth child, a son named Arthur, now nine.</p>
      <p>ITV declined to comment on the identity of the late arrivals going into camp this week.</p>
