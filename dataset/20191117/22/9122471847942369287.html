      <h1>DeAndre Hopkins Calls Out The NFL After Game vs. Ravens</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:26:21+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The Baltimore Ravens absolutely dominated the Houston Texans on Sunday afternoon, winning 41-7, in one of the most-impressive performances of the NFL’s 2019 regular season.</p>
      <p>The contest did include one extremely puzzling call by the referees that hurt the Texans in a major way.</p>
      <p>Houston went deep to DeAndre Hopkins early in the game on a 4th down attempt. The pass was incomplete, though it looked like Hopkins was interfered with. Houston challenged the no-call, but replay review upheld the decision.</p>
      <p>We’re not exactly sure why.</p>

      <p>Hopkins, who had 7 catches for 80 yards in the game, took to Twitter following the game.</p>
      <p>“As a leader in the NFL, we need someone new in New York deciding calls,” he tweeted.</p>

      <p>The NFL implemented the pass interference challenge rule following the 2018 season. It has not gone well. It seems like the majority of calls – whether they are right or wrong – are just automatically upheld by replay review.</p>
      <p>The league needs to take another look at this process in the offseason.</p>
