      <p>Dungog Commonwealth Bank branch has again joined the "#inthebag" campaign, setting up a collection point for handbags in new or near new condition filled with women's personal care and sanitary items.</p>
      <p>The initiative, run by Australian not-for-profit organisation <a href="https://sharethedignity.com.au/christmas-charity/">Share the Dignity</a>, has been providing homeless and at risk women with sanitary products since early 2015.</p>
      <p>Karen Hancock, Branch Manager of Commonwealth Bank Dungog said staff were thrilled to take part in the initiative,which helps make life a bit better for women experiencing homelessness or poverty.</p>
      <p>You can support Share the Dignity by donating a handbag in good condition filled with essential items to a participating Commonwealth Bank branch before December 7.</p>
