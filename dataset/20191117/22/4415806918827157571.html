      <p>Ariana Grande received advice on how to recover from her illness in a friendly Twitter exchange with Barbra Streisand on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Streisand prescribed Grande with a vitamin drink and a bowl of chicken soup to help with a bad sinus infection which forced the Thank U, Next singer to cancel a show that evening.</p>
      <p>The singer had been due to perform at the Rupp Arena in Kentucky on Sunday night as part of her Sweetener World Tour.</p>
      <p>Grande, 26, said: “My head was literally beyond pounding. Throat too,” when describing the effects of an illness which has made her “very sick”.</p>
      <p>Streisand advised her: “Take a strong Vitamin C drink with some Manuka honey, and of course get some chicken soup!”</p>
      <p>Grande replied: “My goodness. Love you so so much. Thank you my sweetest.”</p>

      <p>Grande told fans “it sucks” feeling sick, but “it sucks even more” that she could not be with them.</p>
      <p>She had posted earlier Instagram videos telling them that “my throat and head are still in so much pain”.</p>
      <p>“I sound OK, I’m just in a lot of pain and it’s difficult to breathe during the show,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I just really don’t know what’s happening with my body right now and need to figure it out.”</p>
      <p>Grande said she plans to see a doctor soon.</p>
      <p>She added: “I’m scared that I might have to cancel some things, so this is kind (of) just a heads up of like I don’t know what’s happening with my body, and I’m really disappointed and freaked out of why I can’t get better because it’s been over three weeks at this point.”</p>
