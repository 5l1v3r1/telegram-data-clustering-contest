      <p>Kate Garraway screamed in terror as she walked the plank hundreds of feet in the air on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here!</p>
      <p>The presenter and fellow contestants Ian Wright, Jacqueline Jossa, Roman Kemp, Andrew Maxwell and Myles Stephenson were all chosen to brave a plank walk 334 feet up on the roof of a Gold Coast building.</p>
      <p>Failure potentially meant living in a “rough camp” and basic rations.</p>

      <p>The group were flown to the roof in a helicopter and shrieked when they saw hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly on the top.</p>
      <p>They were told that, in pairs, they had to walk to the end of a plank, down a ladder and into a yellow zone, where they had to hit a light.</p>
      <p>As the wind picked up, Garraway admitted she was not sure she could do it.</p>
      <p>“I can’t do it, I’m falling,” she yelled as she took a few tentative steps. “It’s really windy.”</p>
      <p>“My legs are like jelly!” she called out.</p>
      <p>Urged on by her partner Maxwell, she made it to the ladder but struggled to let go until the rest of the contestants cheered her on.</p>
      <p>Garraway screamed with joy as she finally made it back to the roof.</p>
      <p>“Your legs are like jelly,” she said. “But I really nearly screamed to get off there, I just thought, ‘I can’t do it’.”</p>
      <p>Wright and Jossa also made it through, and the actress said it was actually “fun”.</p>

      <p>“That wind man, the most frightening thing I’ve ever done in my life,” said Wright.</p>
      <p>Kemp and Stephenson had the easiest time, zipping through the challenge in just one minute 45 seconds.</p>
      <p>Their success earned them “power pair” status.</p>
      <p>McPartlin told them: “That means you two will be heading into the better camp.”</p>
      <p>Donnelly added: “The rest of you aren’t so lucky, unfortunately you’ll be sleeping on the floor, sorry about that.”</p>
      <p>A total of 10 contestants are entering the jungle for the new series of the ITV show.</p>
