      <h1>Samsung’s Galaxy One S11 replacement may feature a 4-sided waterfall screen</h1>

      <p>There have been rumours that <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-might-merge-the-galaxy-s-and-note-lines/">Samsung is set to merge their Samsung’s Galaxy Note and S series</a> into a new device called the Samsung Galaxy One, after the device lines have been growing closer in terms of design evolution over the past few years.</p>
      <p>A new design patent by Samsung dating to March 14, 2019,  suggests that device may feature a rather stunning design.</p>

      <p>The design patent shows a handset with 4 “waterfall” edges, both at the sides and top and bottom, with the bottom edge having a slightly more gentle slope, presumably to allow you to more easily know which side is the top and which is the bottom.</p>

      <p>Samsung proposes to replace the side buttons with icons, which we presume to be pressure sensitive.</p>
      <p>There are of course other rumours flying regarding the next flagship Samsung handset, such as that it will have a <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsungs-upcoming-galaxy-s11-smartphone-could-feature-a-samoled-display/">108 Megapixel camera </a>in the rear and <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-to-launch-a-new-smartphone-with-under-the-display-camera-in-2020/">an under-screen camera in front. </a></p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if Samsung will be taking major risks with their next flagship smartphone, be it the Samsung Galaxy One or the Samsung Galaxy S11, but with increasing competition from Chinese OEMs Samsung may no longer be able to slack when it comes to smartphone innovation.</p>
