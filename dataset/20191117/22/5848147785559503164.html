      <h1>Tennis: Roger Federer says young guns catching up … but not just yet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:00:32+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/aap/" target="_blank">AAP</a></address>
      <p>After dominating tennis for so long, Roger Federer thinks the sport’s Big Three could face their toughest challenge yet from a new generation in 2020.</p>
      <p>Federer’s 2019 season ended with a semi-final loss to Stefanos Tsitsipas on Saturday at the ATP Finals, having seen Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal eliminated in the group stage of the tournament.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas – the 21-year-old Greek making his ATP Finals debut – is among the up-and-coming talents that appear ready to finally end the unprecedented era of dominance by the famed trio of veterans.</p>
      <p>Other youngsters at the season-ending tournament include defending champion Alexander Zverev at 22 and US Open runner-up Daniil Medvedev at 23.</p>
      <p>However, it’s not the first time 38-year-old Federer has heard about a talented crop of young players taking over.</p>
      <p>“It’s the same question every year at the end of the year,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But does it feel like this year might be the best year yet?</p>
      <p>“Possibly … But then I look at the list of who finished world No.1, who has been world No.1 all these years, and it’s just crazy that it’s always one of us.</p>
      <blockquote>But we are not getting any younger. So chances increase not because we are getting worse but because they are getting better.’’</blockquote>
      <p>Nadal clinched his fifth year-end No.1 title this week, putting him level with Federer and Djokovic.</p>
      <p>Since 2004, the only other player to finish the year atop the rankings was Andy Murray in 2016.</p>
      <p>In addition, the Big Three have won the past 12 grand slam titles between them.</p>
      <p>Until one of the youngsters ends that streak, any talk of a generation shift is premature.</p>
      <p>“Definitely it’s that next step they need,” Federer said.</p>
      <p>“The only issue is that it seems like me, Novak and Rafa are healthy, healthier than maybe in previous years, as well.”</p>
      <p>Zverev, for his part, is convinced that the new guard is ready to compete for majors.</p>
      <p>“I think next year will bring a new grand slam champion,” the German said after his loss to Dominic Thiem in the second semi-final at the O2 Arena.</p>
      <p>“You know, it can be Daniil, it can be Stefanos, it can be Dominic. I’m in the mix, as well, I hope.</p>
      <p>“We’ll see what next year brings, but I think for the young guys it’s going to be an exciting year.”</p>
