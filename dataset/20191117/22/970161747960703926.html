      <p>‘You were always so positive, kind and a great laugh to be around.</p>
      <p>‘You had my back when not many others did and I’ll always be grateful for the time that we spent together.’</p>
      <p>Sara’s ex-boyfriend Martin Haste, 54, said he had been left ‘absolutely devastated’ by her death.</p>
      <p>He told The Sun Online: ‘It’s such a shock. We split up three months ago but stayed good friends.’</p>
      <p>According to Sara’s Facebook page, she was working as a Planning Expeditor for local door supplier Permadoor.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Jim Bayliss said: ‘Our enquiries are very much in their early stages and at this stage the woman’s death is being treated as suspicious.</p>
