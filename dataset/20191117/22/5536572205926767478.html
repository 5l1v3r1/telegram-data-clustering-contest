      <h1>DeAndre Hopkins Calls Out NFL Refs After Game Against Ravens (TWEET)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:41:44+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:41</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>The Baltimore Ravens absolutely dominated the Houston Texans on Sunday afternoon, winning 41-7, in what was billed as one of the games of the season before the teams took the field.</p>
      <p>That game also included a terribly missed call where the refs hurt the Texans early on with a missed defensive pass interception.</p>
      <p>Deandre Watson went deep to DeAndre Hopkins early in the game on a 4th down attempt, but it fell incomplete, largely due to Hopkins being grabbed before the ball got there.</p>
      <p>Houston challenged it, and they still upheld the call.</p>

      <p>Hopkins, who had 7 catches for 80 yards in the game, took to Twitter and blasted the refs.</p>
      <p>“As a leader in the NFL, we need someone new in New York deciding calls,” he tweeted.</p>

      <p>The league put in this rule following the 2018 season but it has been horrendous all year long as calls are not getting reversed despite replay evidence.</p>
