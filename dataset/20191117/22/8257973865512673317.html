      <p>Nov. 17 (UPI) -- A Colorado woman had her wedding returned to her after losing it on a crowded beach while on vacation in Florida.</p>
      <p>Claire Land believed the ring was lost forever <a href="https://www.wesh.com/article/i-thank-everybody-students-raise-money-to-help-university-employee-buy-new-car/29821762">after she set it down</a> as she applied sunscreen while visiting Cocoa Beach last weekend.</p>
      <p>"I like dug in the sand, ripped the stroller apart, ripped our backpacks apart and it wasn't anywhere," she said.</p>
      <p>Land posted about the ring on Facebook and was eventually directed to Dave Mollison and a website called The Ring Finders.</p>
      <p>Mollison was skeptical when he learned that Land had lost the ring on a particularly b<a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/state/man-returns-womans-lost-wedding-ring-he-found-on-the-beach">usy stretch of the beach</a> and worried someone else may have already found it.</p>
      <p>"A lot of people go out at night and during the day metal detecting there and I didn't think it would still be there after a week," he said.</p>
      <p>However, after walking a grid pattern around the area for four hours on Friday Mollison heard a ping from his metal detector and found Land's ring 10 inches beneath the sand.</p>
      <p>Mollison texted a photo of the ring to a grateful Land who was moved to tears by the news it had been found.</p>
      <p>"I felt like crying again, but in an awesome way, like just disbelief," she said.</p>
