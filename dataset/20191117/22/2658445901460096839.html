You have to manage how you want to enter. Any thing you put a price on, must worth that price. If you are going to chose a name, it is very important that the relationship with you and your style. It is important to have a team with the same vision and supporting the vision,” she said.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian designer said she researched all markets her design would enter to have the best idea of what the customers want.</p>
      <p>“You can believe not just on the brand, but the quality and beauty. It is also important to involve the client to get the best design.
