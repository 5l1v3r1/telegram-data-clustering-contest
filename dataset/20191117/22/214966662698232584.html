      <h1>Folau bushfire comments ‘reprehensible’ </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:53:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.mygc.com.au/author/aap/" target="_blank">AAP</a></address>
      <p>Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has called Israel Folau “reprehensible” after the sacked Wallabies star claimed bushfires crippling Australia were God’s punishment for legalising abortion and same-sex marriage.</p>
      <p>Dumped by Rugby Australia after claiming homosexuals would go to hell, Folau has doubled down in a video sermon posted to the Truth of Jesus Christ Church Sydney.</p>
      <p>“His comments are in line with some of his other comments which are pretty reprehensible,” Mr Albanese told Sky News on Monday.</p>
      <p>“It would good if people thought before they spoke. These comments certainly won’t bring anything positive or constructive to the debate.</p>
      <p>“Mr Folau has a history of making provocative comments. He’s entitled to his view but it’s also incumbent upon people who have a bit of common-sense here to reject those comments.”</p>
      <p>Nationals backbencher Barnaby Joyce said it was pointless to engage with Folau.</p>
      <p>“He throws rocks at us so he feels good, we throw rocks back at him so we feel good … but not one of those actions is making a sandwich for a person fighting the fires,” Mr Joyce told the Seven Network.</p>
      <p>“Not one of those actions is actually in a fire truck trying to stop these fires. Israel can concentrate on what he wants to say and I don’t really care and we’ll concentrate on the fire.”</p>
      <p>During the 10-minute recording, Folau said the timing of the bushfire crisis, which has left six Australians dead, was no coincidence, but rather a taste of God’s judgment.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been looking around at the events that’s been happening in Australia, this past couple of weeks, with all the natural disasters, the bushfires and the droughts,” he said.</p>
      <p>Folau then linked a bible passage to the twin disasters of bushfire and drought and, in turn, the legalising of same-sex marriage and abortion.</p>
      <p>“The events that have happened here in Australia, in the last couple of years – God’s word says for a man and a woman to be together … they’ve come and changed this law,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Abortion, it’s okay now to murder, kill infants, unborn children.”</p>
      <p>Folau said he believed the scripture was talking to Australia.</p>
      <p>“Look how rapid these bushfires these droughts, all these things have come in a short period of time. Do you think it’s a coincidence or not?”</p>
      <p>“God is speaking to you guys. Australia you need to repent and take these laws and turn it back to what is right.”</p>
      <p>The controversy which saw Folau’s $4 million contract torn up in April was the dual international’s second run-in with Rugby Australia after being reprimanded for a similar social media post in 2018.</p>
