      <h1>Aaron Ramsey backs Wales' new generation to get the job done</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/james-candy/" target="_blank">James Candy</a></address>
      <p>“Get the beers in,” was the shout from a Wales player on the charter flight returning from Azerbaijan after Gareth Bale delivered the news the whole cabin had been praying for – a Croatia victory over Slovakia.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/16/wales-stroll-euro-2020-qualifying-victory-azerbaijan-now-eye/">Wales had done their part with a 2-0 win in Azerbaijan</a>, but their Euro 2020 hopes still hinged on the result in Rijeka.</p>
      <p>The talismanic Wales captain had taken on the role of delivering key updates as subdued staff and ­players prayed for a favour from the 2018 World Cup finalists, who had ­conceded an early goal.</p>
      <p>But there was cause for ­celebration as Croatia fought back to qualify automatically with a 3-1 victory and set up an all-or-nothing decider for Wales against Hungary on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Ryan Giggs, the Wales manager, now has a golden opportunity to take his talented new generation to a major tournament alongside some of the 2016 heroes who united a footballing nation.</p>
      <p>“It would mean everything again,” said Aaron Ramsey, who ­returned to the Wales side after a 12-month absence. “We missed out on the World Cup, which was very disappointing. We had the best time ever at the Euros and we want to experience something like that again. We have a lot of new faces that haven’t experienced that so for them as well it would be massive.</p>

      <p>“It’s good to be back. It’s a ­massive win for us tonight to keep the dream alive.”</p>
      <p>It will be knockout football in Cardiff on Tuesday night, and Giggs now has to decide who drops out of his starting XI to accommodate the fit-again Ramsey.</p>
      <p>Bristol City youngster Joe Morrell was the heartbeat of a mature and clinical display in Baku, while Harry Wilson scored a goal and ­provided another operating out of the No10 role.</p>
      <p>Neither knows the pain Ramsey endured when their last qualification campaign ended in disappointment at the hands of Ireland after a decisive final game. But the Juventus midfielder believes this new generation will not waste their chance to return to the top table of European football.</p>
      <p>“It will be a similar position. But we have come on a lot since then. We had some unfortunate injuries that night which played a part.</p>
      <p>“We did the hardest part tonight to get the win. To come away to a place like this is always difficult and tricky. Croatia came here and drew last time, so we know how difficult that is. We’ve got the win and it will go down to the last game.”</p>
      <p>Kieffer Moore was fighting for his footballing future in the lower leagues while Wales were on their Euro 2016 journey, but his physical presence and aerial ability is a real throwback to Chris Coleman’s Wales reign.</p>
      <p>His brace of goals has Wales on the brink of qualification. “There is everything on the line. It will rank the biggest game of my career,” he said.</p>
