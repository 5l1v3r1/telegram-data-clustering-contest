      <h1>ESPN’s Updated Prediction For Alabama-Auburn Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:07:39+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Alabama and Auburn both have effective bye weeks in Week 13, with the Crimson Tide taking on Western Carolina and the Tigers playing Samford.</p>
      <p>So, it’s time to start looking ahead to the Iron Bowl.</p>
      <p>The 2019 edition of the rivalry game will look a lot different than initially expected due to Tua Tagovailoa’s <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/breaking-tua-tagovailoa-is-reportedly-out-for-the-season">unfortunate season-ending injury</a>. The Crimson Tide remain the favorite, however.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Football Power Index has updated its prediction for the game. It’s predicted to be closer than originally projected, though.</p>
      <h3>ESPN’s Football Power Index is giving Alabama a 68.3 percent chance of winning this game, giving Auburn a 31.7 percent chance of pulling off the upset.</h3>
      <p>Alabama needs a win, perhaps in blowout fashion, to remain in the hunt for the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide and the Tigers are set to meet on Saturday, Nov. 30. A kickoff time and TV channel have yet to be announced.</p>
