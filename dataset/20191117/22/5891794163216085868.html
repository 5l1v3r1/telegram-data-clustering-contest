      <p>A variety of events were held in the Czech capital, Prague, to commemorate the Velvet Revolution on November 17. On that day in 1989, a crackdown on a student march by former Czechoslovakia's police triggered events that ended communist rule over the country. While people lit candles in the street where the students marched 30 years ago, Central European leaders attended a ceremony at Prague's National Museum.</p>
