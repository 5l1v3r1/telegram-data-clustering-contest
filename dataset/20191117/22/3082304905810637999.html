        <b>After a tactical battle with Lewis Hamilton at Interlagos, Max Verstappen described the Brazilian Grand Prix as “a lot of fun”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Max Verstappen said it felt “unbelievable” to win a thrilling Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old Dutch driver produced a terrific tactical race to take the victory for Red Bull, his third success of the 2019 season.</p>
      <p>He fought a long battle for supremacy with Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton and prevailed as the world champion wilted.</p>
      <p>“Lewis was very quick so I had to keep pushing,” Verstappen said.</p>
      <p>“All the time with the strategy, he pitted one lap earlier so we had to be really on top of our pit stops.</p>
      <p>“But two times we had a good move with him that brought us back into first [place] and from there onwards I could control the race with the tyres I had.”</p>

      <p>After finishing second – behind Hamilton – at Interlagos last year, this was a sweet result for Verstappen.</p>
      <p>“Unbelievable. It was a lot of fun out there and of course it was great to win the race,” he said.</p>
      <p>He was especially pleased with a key move after a pit stop that helped him get the better of the world champion, who sank to seventh after a frantic finish. Hamilton was involved in a crash with Alex Albon late on and was handed a time penalty after the conclusion of the race.</p>
      <p>“I was behind so I was pushing flat out on my out-lap to try to be close to him and it was my only shot,” Verstappen said.</p>
      <p>“Because of that I was close, into the DRS. We knew we had great top speed the whole weekend already, so that of course is a guess so I was very happy to get past.”</p>
