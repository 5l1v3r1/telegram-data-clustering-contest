      <h3>All of South Australia will be at severe fire danger on Wednesday this week while eight regions will be either catastrophic or extreme.</h3>
      <p>Brett Gage from the BOM told FIVEaa Breakfast on Monday:</p>
      <blockquote>“We’ve got catastrophic in four districts including the Mt Lofty Ranges. The other districts are Yorke Peninsula, the mid north, and lower Eyre Peninsula at this stage.<br/><br/>“We’ve got extreme fire danger for Kangaroo Island, the Flinders district, eastern Eyre Peninsula, and the west coast district… we do have severe fire danger for all remaining parts of South Australia so the whole state would be in a ban.”</blockquote>
      <p>The temp is tipped to reach 42 in Adelaide on Wednesday, before a cool change arrives late evening.</p>
      <blockquote>“We’ll have a cold front moving across the west of the state,” Brett said. “At this stage it’s looking like that front will reach Adelaide around about midnight or perhaps slightly after…<br/><br/>“And then there will be a fresh and gusty southerly change behind it, so the temperature will fall rapidly… but with the wind if there’s any fires going it will be extremely dangerous for fire fighters and anybody else.<br/><br/>“It’s pretty bad. We urge everyone to start thinking about their fire plans.”</blockquote>
