      <h1>Republicans Shift Defense of Trump While He Attacks Another Witness</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:19:32+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:19</time> by <a rel="author">Sheryl Gay Stolberg</a></address>
      <p>WASHINGTON — House Republicans, bracing for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/impeachment-hearings-schedule.html?module=inline">another week of impeachment hearings</a>, asserted on Sunday that President Trump had done nothing wrong because his plans for Ukraine to investigate his political rivals never came to fruition — even as the president complicated their efforts by attacking another witness.</p>
      <p>On a day of back-and-forth on Twitter and the morning television talk shows that are a staple of Sundays in Washington, Speaker Nancy Pelosi invited Mr. Trump to testify before the House Intelligence Committee, while the president’s allies shifted their emphasis away from the defense they offered last week, when they stressed that witnesses had only secondhand information against him.</p>
      <p>That argument may not work much longer, because lawmakers are about to hear from crucial witnesses who had direct contact with the president, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/who-is-gordon-sondland.html?module=inline">Gordon D. Sondland</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/who-is-gordon-sondland.html?module=inline">,</a> a donor to and an ally of Mr. Trump who served as his liaison to Ukrainian officials while the president withheld — but later released — $391 million in military aid to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>“The Ukrainians did nothing to — as far as investigations goes — to get the aid released,” Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of Mr. Trump’s chief defenders, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “So there was never this quid pro quo that the Democrats all promise existed.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Pelosi, also appearing on “Face the Nation,” suggested that Mr. Trump — who is blocking key witnesses like Mick Mulvaney, his acting chief of staff, from testifying — make his case for himself, while delivering a brief lesson in Latin: “If he has information that is exculpatory, that means ex, taking away, culpable, blame, then we look forward to seeing it.”</p>
      <p>Hours after that broadcast, Mr. Trump — who last week attacked Marie L. Yovanovitch, his former ambassador to Ukraine, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1195356198347956224">on Twitter</a> while she was testifying — unleashed an afternoon Twitter storm, lashing out at a second witness, Jennifer Williams, an adviser to Vice President Mike Pence.</p>
      <p>Ms. Williams, a longtime State Department employee with expertise in Europe and Russia who has been detailed to Mr. Pence’s national security staff, is among those who listened to a July 25 telephone call in which Mr. Trump asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to “do us a favor” and investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter.</p>
      <p>Mr. Trump had frozen the military aid about a week before.</p>
      <p>Ms. Williams told House investigators she thought the telephone call was “unusual and inappropriate,” adding, “I guess for me it shed some light on possible other motivations behind a security assistance hold,” according to a <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6463-transcript-jennifer-williams/362d08c68f242716407f/optimized/full.pdf#page=1">transcript</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/16/us/politics/impeachment-trump.html?module=inline">her deposition</a> released Saturday evening by Democrats.</p>
      <p>“Tell Jennifer Williams, whoever that is, to read BOTH transcripts of the presidential calls, &amp; see the just released ststement from Ukraine,” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1196155347117002752">Mr. Trump wrote</a>, making a typographical error in the word “statement.” “Then she should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don’t know &amp; mostly never even heard of, &amp; work out a better presidential attack!”</p>
      <p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1196158097628303361">later referred</a> to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/11/14/world/europe/14reuters-usa-trump-impeachment-ukraine.html?module=inline">statement by the Ukrainian foreign minister</a>, who said last week that Mr. Sondland never explicitly linked the aid to investigations into the Bidens.</p>
      <p>Ms. Williams is not the only witness who listened in on the call expected to testify this week. Others include Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the National Security Council’s top expert on Ukraine, who has told investigators he was so alarmed by the call that he immediately reported it to council lawyers. But Mr. Sondland’s appearance is the most anticipated.</p>
      <p>He has given somewhat contradictory accounts. While he had said in a text message that Mr. Trump did not seek “quid pro quo’s of any kind,” he has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/us/politics/impeachment-trump.html?module=inline">given a written statement to investigators</a> in which he acknowledged that he told a top Ukrainian official that “resumption of the U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anticorruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.”</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Chris Wallace, the host of “Fox News Sunday,” pressed Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, on that point, asking him whether Mr. Sondland might “blow a hole” in Republicans’ defense.</p>
      <p>“The president’s defense is that those things didn’t happen,” Mr. Scalise said, adding: “The real bottom line is he got the money. Ukraine got the money.”</p>
      <p>Later, Mr. Trump attacked Mr. Wallace on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://twitter.com/SteveScalise">@SteveScalise</a> blew the nasty &amp; obnoxious Chris Wallace (will never be his father, Mike!) away on Chris’s lowest rated (unless I’m on) morning show,” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1196148537525977088">the president wrote</a>. “This kind of dumb and unfair interview would never have happened in the <a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNews">@FoxNews</a> past. Great job Steve!”</p>
      <p>Both Mr. Scalise and Mr. Jordan have made such arguments before, but their remarks on Sunday suggest this will be Republicans’ core line of defense this week. What the two congressmen failed to mention, however, is that Mr. Trump released the administration’s hold on the money <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/us/politics/ukraine-aid-white-house.html?module=inline">amid a bipartisan uproar</a> on Capitol Hill and revelations of a whistle-blower’s report that prompted the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>Their responses underscore the difficulty party leaders face in fashioning a defense as evidence mounts against Mr. Trump. On Friday, the Democrats’ case was bolstered by another witness, David Holmes, a top official at the United States Embassy in Kiev, who told investigators in a closed-door deposition that he had overheard Mr. Trump on a cellphone call loudly asking Mr. Sondland if Ukraine’s president had agreed to conduct an investigation into one of his leading political rivals.</p>
      <p>“So, he’s going to do the investigation?” Mr. Trump asked, according to a copy of Mr. Holmes’s <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6459-david-holmes-statement/ce6f6d3c6f2038ebb4b5/optimized/full.pdf#page=1">opening statement</a>.</p>
      <p>“He’s going to do it,” replied Mr. Sondland, who had just come from a meeting with top Ukrainian officials and the country’s president, according to the statement. He also told Mr. Trump that Mr. Zelensky would do “anything you ask him to.”</p>
      <p>Given such clear-cut accounts, some Republican strategists say the party ought to pursue an entirely different strategy.</p>
      <p>“In my judgment, the best defense is that the presidential election has already started,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, “and that we are better off, rather than putting the country through yet another incredibly divisive impeachment process, letting the voters cast the verdict on the Trump administration, which will occur in less than a year.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Sondland, Ms. Williams and Colonel Vindman will be among eight witnesses to testify this week in open session before the House Intelligence Committee. The others are Kurt D. Volker, the former envoy to Ukraine; Timothy Morrison, a departing National Security Council official; Laura K. Cooper, the Defense Department official who oversees military aid to Ukraine; David Hale, the under secretary of state for political affairs; and Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official with expertise in Russia.</p>
      <p>Republicans are looking to Mr. Volker to provide exculpatory evidence. He told investigators that Ukraine’s leaders “never communicated a belief that there was a quid pro quo” and that they were not aware early on of the withholding of military aid “so there was no leverage implied.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Sondland, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/us/politics/impeachment-trump.html?module=inline">reversed himself</a> on parts of his account. In his closed-door deposition, he told investigators he “never” thought there was any precondition on the aid.</p>
      <p>But then he issued a written statement to investigators in which he acknowledged that he had told a top Ukrainian official that the country would most likely have to give Mr. Trump what he wanted — a public pledge for investigations — for the president to release the money.</p>
      <p>“I said that resumption of the U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anticorruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,” Mr. Sondland said in the new statement.</p>
