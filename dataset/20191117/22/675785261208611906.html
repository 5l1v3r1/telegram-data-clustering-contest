      <h1>Aaron Ramsey issues rallying cry to Wales ahead of huge do-or-die game against Hungary</h1>
      <h2>Wales' win over Azerbaijan coupled with Croatia's victory against Slovakia means a win against Hungary on Tuesday would see Ryan Giggs' side qualify automatically for Euro 2020</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p>Aaron Ramsey says Euro 2016 was the time of his life and has urged Wales to seize the chance to return to the finals.</p>
      <p>Victory over Azerbaijan set up a blockbuster final qualifier in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff</a> on Tuesday against Hungary for second spot in Group E behind winners Croatia.</p>
      <p>Ryan Giggs’ side have a play-off spot in the bag already via the Nations League, but are desperate to qualify automatically.</p>
      <p>They kept those hopes alive as they made it four qualifiers unbeaten with a dominant display in Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>Fourteen minutes into the second half, Ramsey, 28, made his first Wales appearance for a year when he came off the bench.</p>

      <p>And the fit-again <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> midfielder is now anxious for another crack at the Euros after helping Wales to the <br/>semi-finals three years ago when he was named in Uefa’s team of the tournament.</p>
      <p>Ramsey, who replaced Gareth Bale for his 59th cap, said: “We missed out on the World Cup, which was disappointing. But we had the best time ever at the Euros and we want to experience something like it again.</p>
      <p>“We have a lot of new faces who haven’t experienced that, so for them as well it would be massive.</p>
      <p>“We did the hardest part to win in Azerbaijan. To come away to a place like this is always difficult and tricky.</p>
      <p>“Croatia came here and drew last time so we knew how difficult it was.</p>
      <p>“Now we go into Tuesday knowing that a win will take us to the Euros. It would mean everything again.”</p>
      <p>Ramsey’s introduction helped Wales comfortably see out the game against opponents who are ranked 111th in the world, 87 places below Giggs’ men.</p>

      <p>Wales led 2-0 at the break. Harry Wilson’s set-piece was headed home by Kieffer Moore for the opener.</p>
      <p>And Dan James set up the second with a superb curler from outside the box which came back off the woodwork for Wilson to head into the net.</p>
      <p>Manager Giggs explained after the game that he could not risk star duo Bale and Ramsey on the pitch together as neither of them had played much for their club sides recently due to injury.</p>
      <p>But he is hoping to start the influential pair against Hungary for the first time in a year.</p>
      <p>Wales defender Chris Mepham said: “The pair of them are world-class players. Rambo made a massive difference when he came on.</p>
      <p>“He provided that assurance and calmness on the ball which filters through the team. As a centre-half it gives you that confidence to pick him out and he changed the game when he came on.</p>

      <p>“Now we have momentum at the right time.</p>
      <p>“We have to take all of these positives into Tuesday’s massive game in front of a home crowd, which always helps us.</p>
      <p>“I would just encourage the supporters to get behind us and believe we can get the result that is needed to take us into the Euros.”</p>
