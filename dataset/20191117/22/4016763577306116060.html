      <h1>The Latest MF DOOM Imposter Turned Out To Be Hannibal Buress</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:59:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:59</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Kelley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/mf-doom">MF DOOM</a> is still as elusive as ever. The eccentric rapper seemed to make a guest appearance during <a href="https://genius.com/artists/flying-lotus">Flying Lotus</a>’ set at the Adult Swim Festival in LA’s Banc of California Stadium. But the true identity behind the mask turned out to be none other than <a href="https://genius.com/artists/hannibal-buress">Hannibal Buress</a>.</p>
      <p>Before the big reveal, Buress performed <a href="https://genius.com/Madvillain-accordion-lyrics">“Accordion.”</a> When FlyLo unmasked the Doctor Doom-style villain, he asked, “Hannibal, what are you doing here?” The comic had this to say: “I wanted to help out.”</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first time a “DOOMposter” acted as a stand-in for the real deal. The <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Madvillain/Madvillainy">Madvillainy</a></i> artist is notorious for sending imposters in his place. Back in 2009, he spoke to <i><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/09/21/the-mask-of-doom">The New Yorker</a></i>’s Ta-Nehisi Coates about his thought process. “I’m the writer, I’m the director,” said the rapper known as Daniel Dumile. “If I was to go out there without the mask on, they’d be like, ‘Who the fuck is this?’… I might send a white dude next.”</p>
      <p>That same year, he elaborated on why he doesn’t view his stand-ins as imposters in an interview with <i><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.10799/title.promoter-says-doom-impostors-are-intentional">HipHopDX</a></i>. “I choose different characters, I choose their direction and where I want to put them,” he said. “So who I choose to put as the character is up to me. The character that I hired, he got paid for it. There’s no imposter."</p>
      <p>It’s unclear if he had any involvement in the setup at the Adult Swim Festival.</p>
      <p>FlyLo and DOOM previously linked up on <a href="https://genius.com/Flying-lotus-masquatch-lyrics">“Masquatch”</a> for <i>Grand Theft Auto V</i>. However, the electronic producer later <a href="https://www.factmag.com/2015/05/01/mf-doom-pulls-out-of-tonights-flying-lotus-gig-replaced-by-jay-electronica/">claimed the Madvillain MC “flaked”</a> on a joint gig in London, and he was replaced on the setlist by <a href="https://genius.com/artists/jay-electronica">Jay Electronica</a>.</p>
      <p>DOOM’s history with Adult Swim reaches back to 2005, when he teamed up with <a href="https://genius.com/artists/danger-mouse">Danger Mouse</a> on <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Dangerdoom/The-mouse-and-the-mask">The Mouse and The Mask</a></i>, constructed out of samples from Cartoon Network’s nighttime programming. In 2017, he worked directly with Adult Swim on <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Mf-doom/The-missing-notebook-rhymes"><i>The Missing Notebook Rhymes</i></a> project. He was supposed to drop 15 unreleased tracks in 15 weeks. But Adult Swim <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pakzny/doom-and-adult-swim-abruptly-end-their-relationship">abruptly cut ties</a> with him after week seven.</p>
      <p>Back in March, the masked rhymer talked to <i><a href="https://www.spin.com/featured/mf-doom-madvillain-interview-madvillainy-anniversary/">Spin</a></i> about how he has <a href="https://genius.com/a/mf-doom-says-he-has-three-or-four-albums-worth-of-unreleased-material-with-madlib">several albums worth of material</a> with <a href="https://genius.com/artists/madlib">Madlib</a> in the vault. “Since then, we’ve recorded a lot more stuff. There’s a few of them we could put out as whole albums. I’m just looking for the right time,” he said. “It’s hard to choose a time, as far as the manufacturing side, and the business side. Once that’s all out of the way, people will hear more of it. It’s a ton of stuff that we got.”</p>
      <p>DOOM’s last solo studio album, <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Mf-doom/Born-like-this"><i>Born Like This</i></a>, dropped back in 2009. Since then, he’s taken on collaborative projects like <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Nehruviandoom"><i>NehruvianDOOM</i></a> with <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Bishop-nehru">Bishop Nehru</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Czarface-and-mf-doom/Czarface-meets-metal-face"><i>CZARFACE Meets Metal Face</i></a> with <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Wu-tang-clan">Wu-Tang Clan</a>’s <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Inspectah-deck">Inspectah Deck</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/7l-and-esoteric">7L &amp; Esoteric</a>.</p>
      <p>The lineup at Adult Swim’s festival included <a href="https://genius.com/artists/vince-staples">Vince Staples</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/2-chainz">2 Chainz</a>, and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/rapsody">Rapsody</a>.</p>
