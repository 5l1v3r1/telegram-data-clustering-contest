      <h1>Charlotte Flair: WWE Evolution 2 is a matter of creating storylines that people want to see</h1>
      <h2>WWE Evolution pay-per-view was a groundbreaking event last year where Raw Women’s Champion Ronda Rousey overcame Nikki Bella, SmackDown Women’s Champion Becky Lynch was the Last Woman Standing against Charlotte Flair.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:03:46+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/rahul-sadhu/" target="_blank">Rahul Sadhu</a></address>
      <p>WWE changed the game one year ago with the historic ‘Evolution’ — the all-women’s pay-per-view, an event that played a huge role in the growth of the company’s women’s revolution.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly the event was met with plenty of fanfare from pro-wrestling fans across the globe leading to the clamour for a sequel.</p>
      <p>However, the company did very little to get viewers excited for another follow-up and solely relied on its initial buzz to build anticipation.</p>
      <p>So does it mean that there has been a loss in momentum?</p>
      <p>“That is a tough question but I do not think it has lost its momentum. I think its a matter of creating storylines that people want to see on the card for Evolution,” former SmackDown Women’s Champion Charlotte Flair told the <i><a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a></i>.</p>

      <p>A certain section of the fans also believes that since WrestleMania 35, WWE’s women’s division has taken somewhat of a backseat on both Raw and SmackDown.</p>
      <p>But Charlotte doesn’t think so.</p>
      <p>“I think we get the same amount of opportunities. So why have another all-women event? There were 4 Wrestlemania matches for women last year. Plus I want to be on the card with men and say I am better than you,” said Flair.</p>
      <p>One could argue that WWE’s problems to maintain a consistent viewing audience did have a lot to do with poor storytelling than the push of the women’s division, which, ironically enough, was a complete overthought en route to the inaugural Evolution pay-per-view last fall.</p>
      <p>This year, at the time, WWE was building to three pay-per-views at once—Evolution, Survivor Series and Crown Jewel and WWE unsurprisingly prioritized the latter two even though Evolution took place on October 28 while Super Show-Down and Survivor Series weren’t until November.</p>

      <p>So there is still some conflict over the culmination of Evolution II, at least for 2019. Only two events are remaining as per the current listing with one of them being Survivor Series on November 24th.</p>
      <p>The final PPV of the year will be WWE TLC on December 15th leaving no slot for another Network special. So the women superstars are likely to wait until 2020 to perform in another all-women show.</p>
      <p>With 2019 almost coming to an end what are the goals ahead for the 10-time Women’s Champion?</p>
      <p>“To continue with my momentum and main event again and build more depth on RAW and SmackDown,” she signed off by saying.</p>

      <p>Daughter of legendary WWE superstar Ric Flair, Charlotte is a second generation professional wrestler currently drafted under the RAW brand. She is currently on a three-day visit to India.</p>
