      <h1>Trump disses Pence aide Jennifer Williams after impeachment testimony</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:46:36+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:46</time> by <a rel="author">Ebony Bowden</a></address>
      <p>President Trump attacked Mike Pence’s top national security aide on Sunday after she told impeachment investigators she <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/pence-aide-calls-trumps-call-with-ukraine-unusual-and-inappropriate/">felt Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine were “inappropriate.”</a></p>
      <p>In an afternoon Twitter missive, the president attacked Jennifer Williams as a “Never Trumper” and told her to read both transcripts of his calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
      <p>“Tell Jennifer Williams, whoever that is, to read BOTH transcripts of the presidential calls, &amp; see the just released ststement [sic] from Ukraine. Then she should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don’t know &amp; mostly never even heard of, &amp; work out a better presidential attack!” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1196155347117002752">he wrote</a>.</p>
      <p>Williams is a longtime State Department employee who serves as Vice President Mike Pence’s special adviser for Europe in Russia and listened to the call between Trump and Zelensky <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/white-house-releases-transcript-of-trumps-first-call-with-ukraines-volodymyr-zelensky/">on July 25</a>.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, the House Intelligence Committee released the transcript of her closed-door testimony, in which she told investigators that the Trump-Zelensky call <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/pence-aide-calls-trumps-call-with-ukraine-unusual-and-inappropriate/">seemed “unusual and inappropriate.”</a></p>
      <p>Williams testified that she found the call “to be more political in nature” and “more political than diplomatic.”</p>
      <p>She also said she found the conversation “more specific to the president in nature, to his personal agenda … as opposed to a broad foreign policy objective of the United States.”</p>
      <p>Williams is expected to testify publicly next week as part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Trump’s dealings with Ukraine.</p>
