      <h1>Gonzaga women lose in overtime at 3rd-ranked Stanford</h1>

      <p>STANFORD, Calif. – <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/high-school/debate-settled-central-valley-girls-basketball-best-in-the-nation-and-washington-history/">Lexie Hull, a graduate of Central Valley High</a> in Spokane Valley, was unable to play against Gonzaga last year because of an injury, making a game against her hometown team this season even more special.</p>
      <p>Hull contributed 20 points and eight rebounds to lead No. 3 Stanford past the Zags 76-70 in overtime Sunday night.</p>
      <p>The Cardinal recovered from a poor-shooting first half that included going 2 of 14 on three-pointers.</p>
      <p>“We know that sometimes the offense won’t be there, so you focus on defense,” said Hull, a 6-foot sophomore guard. “You have to stay positive and stick together.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/gonzaga-bulldogs/gonzaga-women-take-down-no-8-stanford-79-73-to-improve-to-8-1-on-the-season/">Gonzaga beat Stanford 79-73 in Spokane</a> in December.</p>
      <p>Jill Townsend scored 18 points before fouling out in overtime to lead the Zags.</p>
      <p>Kayleigh Truong and Melody Kempton each added 12 points and Jessie Loera had 10.</p>

      <p>“We’re disappointed. We know how good they are and we know we’re a good team, too,” Gonzaga coach Lisa Fortier said. “We talked a lot about winning the possession game because Stanford is so efficient…We wanted to be decisive. We outrebounded them by one and we had one fewer turnover, but that wasn’t enough.”</p>
      <p>Hull scored eight points and grabbed an important rebound in the final 3:02 of overtime.</p>
      <p>“Lexie made some big shots, some big free throws and played great defense,” Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said.</p>
      <p>Townsend tied the score at 60 with 48 seconds remaining in regulation, making a big three-pointer.</p>
      <p>“I just had to step up with a lot of confidence to hit that shot,” said Townsend, who is from Okanogan. “We got big shots at the right moments to put ourselves in position.”</p>
      <p>Loera, who is from Moses Lake, made two free throws to put Gonzaga ahead with 17 seconds left, but Stanford’s Kiana Williams responded with a driving layup nine seconds later to force overtime.</p>
      <p>Williams scored 20 of her 22 points after halftime.</p>
      <h3>Pivec is voted MVP</h3>
      <p>CORVALLIS, Ore. – Mikayla Pivec of Lynnwood scored 18 points and was voted most valuable player of the tournament as No. 7 Oregon State beat Missouri State 80-69 in the Preseason WNIT championship game.</p>
      <p>Pivec also had seven rebounds and six assists.</p>
      <p>Destiny Slocum scored all 17 of her points in the second half for the Beavers (4-0).</p>
