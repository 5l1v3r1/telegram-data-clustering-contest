      <h1>Kulbhushan Jadhav is face of India's ''export'' of terrorism to Pakistan: FO</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:52:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:52</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) - Pakistan on Sunday rejected the unfounded remarks reportedly made by the Indian External Affairs Minister (EAM) in an interview with a French newspaper and in interaction with certain other media outlets.</p>
      <p>Foreign Office in a statement said this outburst is yet another reflection of India’s characteristic hubris and the BJP government s well-known smear campaign against Pakistan.</p>
      <p>It is deplorable that to further the RSS-BJP extremist ideological and nationalistic agenda, and to divert global attention from the gory reality in IoJ&amp;K, senior Indian officials continue to manufacture “facts” both with regard to the issue of terrorism and the situation in IoJ&amp;K. If anything, Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav is the face of India’s “export” of terrorism to Pakistan, it said.</p>
      <p>Similarly, India s frustration is evident from the fact that despite its relentless State-terrorism in IOJ&amp;K for decades, it has failed to muzzle the peaceful voices of the Kashmiri people and their demand for self-determination, promised to them in the United Nations Security Council resolutions, the statement added.</p>
      <p>India also continues to be the safe haven for those preaching hate and carrying out hate crimes, including against its own minorities, with impunity and indeed under state patronage.</p>
      <p>As regards the Minister s farcical claim that the “situation is back to normal” in IoJ&amp;K, the question is why this ‘normalcy’ is not visible to the outside world? For India, there is no escape from the reality that its State-sponsored repression cannot break the will and indomitable spirit of the Kashmiri people.</p>
      <p>India would be well-advised to move away from its obsession with Pakistan and also from its continued denial of reality.</p>
      <p>Pakistan, for its part, would continue to highlight the plight of the people of IoJ&amp;K and reiterate its call for the peaceful resolution of the international dispute of Jammu &amp; Kashmir.</p>
      <p>As a country that has suffered the most from cross-border terrorism, Pakistan would continue to contribute constructively to regional and global efforts to promote peace and prosperity in the region and beyond.</p>
