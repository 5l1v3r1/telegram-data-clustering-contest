      <p>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Former defense official Gotabaya Rajapaksa has been sworn in as Sri Lanka’s president and appealed to the minority Tamil and Muslim communities who voted against him to rally around him.</p>
      <p>Rajapaksa is credited with helping to end a long civil war and comfortably won last Saturday’s presidential election. But minorities feared his election over human rights allegations against him dating from the war.</p>
      <p>Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya administered the oath of office to Rajapaksa at the 140 B.C Ruwanweli Seya Buddhist temple in ancient kingdom of Anuradhapura in north-central Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p>In his address to the nation Monday, he also pledged to give national security priority and follow a neutral foreign policy.</p>
