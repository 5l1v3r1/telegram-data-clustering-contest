      <p>Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson and Ravens signal-caller Lamar Jackson are competing against each other for the league’s MVP award, but it’s all love between the two young stars.</p>
      <p>It was Jackson who came out on top during Sunday’s game — as he’s done over the past month, having beaten Watson, Russell Wilson and Tom Brady — with the Ravens destroying the Texans, 41-7.</p>
      <p>Still, the two quarterbacks shared a warm embrace after the game, with an interesting conversation as well. They even swapped jerseys on the field, swarmed by reporters and photographers.</p>

      <p>Watson shared what the two talked about after the game, and even revealed that he wrote “MVP” on Jackson’s jersey.</p>

      <p>Well, it appears Jackson has Watson’s vote for MVP. He does appear to be the current leader for the award, with Wilson right behind him.</p>
