      <h1>Celtic and Rangers Euro heroics could kibosh Scotland fixture postponement ahead of Euro 2020 play-off</h1>
      <h2>If Rangers, Celtic or both reach the last 16 of the Europa League, Steve Clarke's hopes of extra training time will be ruined.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:29:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Gavin Berry, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gavin-berry/</a></address>
      <p>Steve Clarke's plea to scrap top flight Sunday games ahead of Scotland’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> play-off is set to fall on deaf ears if the Old Firm progress in Europe.</p>
      <p><i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>can reveal that SFA chief executive <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ian-maxwell">Ian Maxwell</a> has written to SPFL secretary Iain Blair to formally request that no Scottish Premiership fixtures from the March 21 card are pushed back 24 hours.</p>
      <p>But if <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> or Rangers reach the Europa League last-16 then their games - at home to St Johnstone and away to St Mirren respectively - will have to be switched to the Sunday with the second leg of that round taking place on March 19.</p>
      <p>The Hoops have already secured their place in the knockout stage with their rivals on course to join them in the last 32.</p>
      <p>Clarke called for help from league fixture schedulers as he looks for support from the nation’s football chiefs ahead of Scotland’s first play-off for a major tournament in 17 years - the country’s most important fixture in a generation.</p>

      <p>And, speaking ahead of Saturday’s 2-1 in Cyprus, SFA president <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rod-petrie">Rod Petrie</a> even admitted they would consider asking for the entire card to be postponed in future discussions with their Hampden counterparts.</p>
      <p>That would giave Clarke 11 days as opposed to just five to work with his home-based players on the training ground ahead of the semi-final clash, like to be against Bulgaria or Israel, on March 26 before a potential final just five days later.</p>
      <p>It’s unlikely the SPFL would agreed to that, however, they will do their best to facilitate Maxwell’s written request for no Sunday games ahead of the play-off semi-final.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But that will depend on talks with broadcasters, which won’t take place until early next year, and the Old Firm’s Euro progress.</p>
      <p>A SPFL spokesperson previously said: “We would always be keen to help the national side if possible, but as Steve (Clarke) himself acknowledged, in a very congested schedule any such request is difficult to deliver. In addition, there is a real possibility of fixtures going to Sunday regardless of Celtic and/or <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> progress in the Europa League.”</p>
      <p>Scoland stand just 180 minutes away from ending a 22-year wait to reach a major tournament thanks to a play-off place secured by Clarke’s predecessor Alex McLeish through the Nations League.</p>
