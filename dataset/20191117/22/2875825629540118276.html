      <h2>I'm A Celebrity viewers were furious over the amount of abuse realty TV star Caitlyn received this evenning</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:09:16+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:09</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Furious I'm A Celebrity fans took to Twitter to defend Caitlyn Jenner over the torrent of transphobic abuse she was receiving online.</p>
      <p>Tonight, ten new celebrities began their jungle journey as they took part in a number of terrifying tasks before heading to camp.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, however, was fearless as she was asked to jump out of a plane - something she had never done before despite being a pilot for 45 years.</p>
      <p>But, unfortunately, tonight's show was ruined for some over the transphobia hurled Caitlyn's way.</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "I’ve already seen some comments but can u mfs pls have some decency and stop with this transphobic s*** towards caitlyn. you are not the comedians you think u are. you’re just being pricks. #ImACeleb."</p>

      <p>While another pleaded: "pls don’t be transphobic towards caitlyn, there’s no need #ImACeleb."</p>
      <p>A third fumed: "Ugh transphobic people already started about how Caitlyn Jenner is not a woman and it’s disgusting etc etc etc #ImACeleb."</p>

      <p>"Not ready to read all the unnecessary transphobic comments #ImACeleb," one commented.</p>
      <p>Another remarked: "I'm enjoying going through twitter and blocking everyone who makes transphobic jokes during the ad break. #ImACeleb."</p>
