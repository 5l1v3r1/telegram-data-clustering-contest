      <h1>ESPN’s New Year’s Six Bowl Projections After Week 12</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:56:59+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Week 12 is in the books following one of the most impactful weeks of college football all year. ESPN has updated its bowl projections to reflect the big results.</p>
      <p>Between Tua Tagovailoa’s season-ending injury for Alabama and Minnesota and Baylor both seeing their unbeaten runs snapped, there will likely be a lot of changes to the College Football Playoff and bowl game projections.</p>
      <p>Next week’s marquee game will be Ohio State vs. Penn State in a matchup of Big Ten titans with a spot in the Big Ten Championship Game – and possibly the College Football Playoff on the line.</p>
      <p>But before we examine who will win next week’s big games, let’s take a look at ESPN’s updated picks for the CFP and the New Year’s Six bowl matchups.</p>
