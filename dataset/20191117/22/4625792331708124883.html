      <h1>Pelosi: Trump has 'every opportunity to present his case' on impeachment</h1>

      <p>Nancy Pelosi claimed that President Trump has "every opportunity" to explain himself and his actions in the current impeachment investigation in the House of Representatives.</p>
      <p>During an interview with CBS News's Margaret Brennan on Sunday morning, the 79-year-old House speaker addressed claims from the president and House Republicans that Trump is not being afforded due process.</p>
      <p>"The president could come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants to take the Oath of Office or he could do it in writing. He has every opportunity to present his case," Pelosi remarked, before pivoting to compare the president's alleged crimes to the actions of disgraced President Richard Nixon.</p>
      <p>She added, "It's really a sad thing. I mean, what the president did was so much worse than even what Richard Nixon did. At some point, Richard Nixon cared about the country enough to recognize that this could not continue."</p>
      <p>At another point in the interview, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nancy-pelosi-trump-attacked-former-ambassador-to-ukraine-during-hearing-because-he-is-an-impostor">Pelosi was asked</a> about Trump's disparaging tweet about former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch during her testimony in front of the House Intelligence Committee on Friday. Yovanovitch was asked about it in real time and said the tweet, "<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/impeachment-hearing-day-two-nunes-reads-latest-call-transcript-yovanovitch-felt-threatened-by-trump">sounded like a threat</a>."</p>
      <p>"He knows her strength, and he was trying to undermine it," Pelosi said, giving her perspective of Trump’s criticism. "He should not frivolously throw out insults, but that’s what he does. I think part of it is his own insecurity as an impostor. I think he knows full well that he's in that office way over his head, and so he has to diminish everyone else."</p>
