      <p>America’s favorite momager might be headed to Bravo’s <i>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i>. <a href="https://www.etonline.com/kyle-richards-talks-lisa-vanderpump-and-whether-kris-jenner-will-ever-join-rhobh-exclusive-136470"><i>RHOBH</i>’s Kyle Richards teased a Kris Jenner cameo</a> in Season 10 of the reality TV series. Richards, who similarly appeared in an episode of <i>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</i> in early November, has been a longtime friend of the Kardashian-Jenner clan. At the 2019 BravoCon on Friday, Nov. 15, the Bravo star teased a possible cameo from her good friend ahead of the series’ 2020 return. “Stay tuned,” Richards told <i>Entertainment Tonight </i>of a possible Jenner cameo. "I'm just saying. You'll have to tune in this season and see for yourself."</p>
      <p>At BravoCon, Richards also teased the addition of new <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/rhobh-season-10-cast-will-include-new-housewives-garcelle-beauvais-sutton-stracke-18713309"><i>RHOBH</i> cast-members Garcelle Beauvais and Sutton Stracke</a> and said there would never be a “dull moment” in Beverly Hills. “We have a lot of stuff going on,” Richards said. “With all these women, two new cast members, like usual, not everyone gets along. Everyone has a different opinion about things, and it's not just only drama. We also do have fun too. Great trips and exciting stuff going on, so it's a little mix of everything.”</p>
      <p>Beauvais and Stracke’s addition to <i>RHOBH</i> comes after <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/bravos-statement-about-lisa-vanderpump-potentially-leaving-rhobh-focuses-on-the-current-season-17949885">Lisa Vanderpump departed the series in June</a> amid feuds with her co-stars on and off the screen. The <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/teddi-mellencamps-comments-on-the-rhobh-puppygate-drama-explain-why-she-got-involved-16988572">series’ “Puppygate” drama</a> and Richards’ Twitter spat with Vanderpump’s husband <a href="https://www.etonline.com/lisa-vanderpumps-husband-ken-todd-slams-rhobh-cast-their-pettiness-says-everything-129089">Ken Todd, who accused the cast of “pettiness”</a> and “nastiness” toward his wife, for example, have been a source of contention among the co-stars.</p>

      <p>While Vanderpump is no longer on the series, Richards told<i> ET </i>that she harbors no ill will toward her former co-star and would be gracious to her in the future. Richards said, "I would say, 'Hi, how are you?' I just bumped into her in Beverly Hills about a week and a half ago and I said, 'Hi. How are you?'" When pressed on whether their relationship was “cordial,” Richards said, “It is on my end."</p>
      <p>As for Jenner’s potential cameo, there’s no telling what the storyline would entail. Given <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/rhobh-star-kyle-richards-comments-on-kris-jenner-shows-their-friendship-is-the-real-deal-17298219">Jenner and Richards’ decades-long friendship,</a> however, fans could presume it’ll be drama free. In an interview with the New Zealand radio station The Edge in 2017, <a href="https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/kyle-richards-kris-jenner-friendship">Richards said of her bond with Jenner</a>, “I’ve known Kris for so many years, forever, when all the kids were babies and my nieces Paris and Nicky [Hilton] were friends with Kim and Khloé and Kourtney.”</p>
      <p>She added, “So I've known them forever and it's nice to have friends we've known each other before all this — before I was a <i>Housewife</i> and before <i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</i> and all that. We just love to hang out and laugh."</p>
