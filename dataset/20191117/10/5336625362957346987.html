      <p><b>TL;DR: </b>Get the nostalgic <a href="https://zdcs.link/p8eK4">Altec Lansing ALT-500 Turntable</a> for $74.99, a 50% savings. </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>We're not breaking any news by telling you that vinyl is back. In early 2019, a <a href="https://thevinylfactory.com/news/us-vinyl-sales-revenue-30-year-high/">report</a> by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) revealed that revenue from vinyl sales in the US had reached its highest point since 1988. While we typically assume old = bad when it comes to tech, it’s easy to see why <a href="https://zdcs.link/p8eK4">vinyl</a> has made a comeback.</p>
      <p>In the age of streaming, physically searching for a record, holding it in your hands, and hearing the stylus crackle as it rests on the vinyl can feel like an unexpectedly transcendent experience. Plus there’s that "warm, rich" sound that crate-diggers always swear by.</p>
      <p>But, unless you’re really committed to the vinyl cause, you’re still going to want to listen to music without having to buy an entire album. You know, like stream it. The way everyone else does. </p>
      <p>On that note, wouldn’t it be a space-saving stroke of luck if you could do this with the <a href="https://zdcs.link/p8eK4">very turntable</a> on which your analog dreams are made? </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/p8eK4">Altec Lansing ALT-500 Turntable</a> is a sleek, stylish looking throwback that will look great in your home. Along with vinyl records, it can connect with your devices via Bluetooth so you can stream your Spotify or Apple Music account (or whatever service you pledge your monthly cash to). The turntable has its own built-in speakers, but you can boost the sound quality by connecting with a Bluetooth speaker, or with your home Hi-Fi via RCA outputs.</p>
      <p>Just don’t get too close to it when you’re dancing. It might skip.</p>
      <p><a href="https://zdcs.link/p8eK4">Normally, you'd be able to grab it for $74.99</a> in the Mashable Shop. But today is not a normal day. This month, you can jump on Black Friday savings early by entering the code <b>BFSAVE15</b> for 15% off — bringing the price to just $63.74.</p>
