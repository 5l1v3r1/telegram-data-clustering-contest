      <p>Highways England reported on Twitter this morning that they were working to fix the issue as soon as possibly but that there was no time frame for it re-opening.</p>
      <p>However, the bridge was eventually lowered before 9.30am on Sunday morning (November 17).</p>
      <p>It was the second time that the bridge has closed in four days following technical issues.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.eadt.co.uk/1.6374668">diversion route had to be put in place on Thursday</a> after hydraulics problems meant that Highways England engineers were unable to lower the bridge.</p>
      <p>It remained closed all of Thursday morning, finally opening just before 3pm.</p>
      <p>The bridge is currently undergoing maintanence and is closed nightly from 8pm until 6am. Work is scheduled to finish on November 24.</p>
