      <p>Ready, Player One — we have mere weeks to prepare for<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/black-friday-2019-deals-when-best-sales-start-uk-shops/"> Black Friday 2019</a>'s annual avalanche of gaming deals.</p>
      <p>Come November 29, the digital world will once again be inundated with offers on the PS4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and every console-toting games bundle in between. </p>
      <p>Traditionally, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/predictions-best-tablet-deals-black-friday-cyber-monday-sale/">Black Friday’s tech</a> offering tends to include some of the best gaming deals of the year. The trick is figuring out where and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-black-friday-deals-2019-uk-what-offers-discounts-where/">when to find the best price</a> - particularly as the very best tend to sell out in a few hours.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re in the market for a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/0/best-christmas-gift-ideas-2019-top-presents-put-ask-this-year/">Christmas gift </a>that will keep your child smiling through the new year or you’re simply looking to expand your own PC and video games arsenal, it's time to get your game-face on.</p>
      <p>Here is our ultimate guide to the best predicted gaming deals in the Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2019 sales .</p>
      <h3>Predictions for Black Friday and Cyber Monday gaming deals </h3>
      <p>For gamers, the Black Friday draw is not only big savings on games and consoles, but the tech accessories required to game like a pro - gaming laptops, keyboards, monitors, headsets, graphics cards and more. </p>
      <p>If VR gaming has piqued your interest, it might even be the opportunity you’ve been waiting for to get a HTC Vive, Oculus Rift or Sony PlayStation VR at an affordable price. Black Friday deals are expected to knock more than £100 off the retail price of VR headsets, though prices will vary across different retailers on different days. HTC is also expected to throw a Viveport subscription into a HTC Vive or Vive Pro deal, as they’ve done in previous years. </p>
      <p>Consoles and video games tend to create the most buzz throughout Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but their popularity begets pandemonium and speedy sell-outs. We advise deciding what you’re looking for (and at what price) before the sales period begins to ensure you don’t delay and miss out on a deal. </p>
      <p>For a PS4 or Xbox specifically, it’s worth nothing that console-plus-games bundles are almost always better value than standalone console discounts. Before snapping one up, consider which games you may want to purchase in the coming months. Often, bundle deals drastically discount the cost of one or two popular titles and throw in genre-friendly games you may not discover otherwise.</p>
      <p>As console technology advances, many gamers also look towards 4K TVs to get the best visual experience. If full-game immersion is your thing, it may be worth taking a look at our <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-tv-deals-black-friday-2019-uk-cyber-monday-sales/">best Black Friday TV deals</a>.</p>
      <h3>Xbox One deals - what will be on offer?</h3>
      <p>The Xbox One X and Xbox One S are still two of the most desirable games consoles in the world, particularly over Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>
      <p>As you might expect, the cheapest deals are always found on the slightly-less-powerful Xbox One S — particularly when it's included in bundles. In the past, we’ve seen a Xbox One S 500GB bundled with Rocket League, COD WW2 and a NOW TV subscription for just £199.99.</p>
      <p>Xbox One X deals will always be more expensive than the S’s, but they’re also generally better value. Even now, <a href="http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(266696)a(2976589)epi=(customid)url(https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/xbox-one-x-1-tb-console-gears-5-limited-edition-bundle/8PGWFQ51SRPP?icid=Cat-Xbox-Hero1-GoW5-X1XLE)">Microsoft have bundled a Limited Edition Xbox One X</a>, full-game download of Gears 5 Ultimate Edition and the Xbox Wireless Controller for £449.99. Come Black Friday, prices could drop by £100 on such offers.</p>
      <p>If previous Black Fridays are any indication, we expect to see the Xbox One X at roughly £100 off, Xbox One S around £50 off, and deeper discounts for both consoles in their respective bundles.</p>
      <h3>PS4 deal predictions</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/ps4/">PS4 </a>Pro will be celebrating its fourth Black Friday this year, meaning it is likely to be offered at its lowest-ever price. Bundles for both the flagship PS4 and PS4 Slim could also exceed £100s off this year, following rumours that the models are heading into the final stage of their life cycle.</p>
      <p>All three consoles are still just as powerful and reliable as they were on release, making the best choice entirely subjective, but it is worth investing in the Pro model (for its upgraded GPU and a high CPU clock rate) if you’re eyeing up 4K-supported games.</p>
      <p>Last year, the best value PS4 deal was from Very. The online retailer bundled a PS4 Slim 1TB console with God of War and chopped the price from £359.99 to £269.99.</p>
      <p>Many retailers try to jump on Playstation’s Black Friday bandwagon to draw new customers in. Retail favourites like <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/amazon-black-friday-2019-best-deals-when-early-sale-start-uk/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/argos-black-friday-2019-deals-best-sale-predictions-toys-smart-home/">Argos </a>and Currys have all built a reputation on the back of their annually-awaited PS4 deals.<b> </b>Last year, Currys even bundled the standard PlayStation 4 Pro console with Red Dead Redemption 2 and a twin docking station for £229.99.</p>
      <h3>Nintendo Switch deals and discounts</h3>
      <p>In its short tenure the Switch has not only become the fastest-selling console in Nintendo's history, but has now become one of the most searched-for items over the Black Friday weekend. </p>
      <p>Still, the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/nintendo-switch/">Nintendo Switch’s</a> demand rarely falters and retailers continue to turn a profit on the handheld console. In short: discounts aren’t all that drastic. </p>
      <p>Last year the best Nintendo Switch deal was offered from Amazon, knocking £30 off the console’s retail price of £279. Bundles are also available at times, like last year’s console-plus-Super Mario Odyssey deal (from £329 to £299 at Currys), but the discounts don’t get much deeper.</p>
      <p>We expect bundle and console PS4 deals to be no more than £50 off throughout Black Friday 2019.</p>
      <p>It is worth remembering, however, that Nintendo has long reigned supreme as the leaders of handheld gaming and is  likely to offer much deeper discounts on the 3DS and 2DS. Based on patterns we’ve seen in previous years, the XL version of each model is likely to be reduced to roughly £130 (for the 3DS XL) and less than £100 (for the 2DS XL).</p>
      <h3>PC and video game deal predictions</h3>
      <p>Gaming chart-toppers will again be at the forefront of major retailers’ Black Friday deals because they get customers through the door – virtual or otherwise. </p>
      <p>This year, most people will be looking out for discounts on Borderlands 3, Tom Clancy's The Division 2.. Resident Evil 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/red-dead-redemption-2/">Red Dead Redemption 2 </a>- and they’re sure to find them.</p>
      <p>By the same token, many of 2019's long-awaited releases will come out in the weeks before Black Friday and could well be discounted as flash or ‘Lightning’ deals. Set <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/news/fifa-20-review-football-sim-takes-noisy-neighbour-fortnite-battle/">FIFA 20</a> (out September 27), Destiny 2: Shadowkeep (October 1), WWE 2K20 (October 24), Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Orde (November 15), Shenmue 3 (November 19) and Doom Eternal (November 22) on a deal alert so you don’t miss out.</p>
      <p>As always, beloved cult favourites like Divinity: Original Sin 2 are expected to use the annual sales event to reach a wider audience. Look for indie games outside of bundle deals to take advantage of rare discounts.</p>
      <p>Though you will be lucky to find new games discounted by more than £20, older games (think pre-2016) have been discounted by as much as 80 per cent in previous years’ sales.</p>
      <h3>The best gaming subscription deals</h3>
      <p>As they're almost never discounted, you will want to keep an eye out for deals on gaming subscriptions like PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Gold.</p>
      <p>We expect many of the best subscription deals will be offered in console bundles. With the increased price of PS Plus, notably, it might almost be worth choosing a subscription bundle over a games bundle to secure long-term discounts.</p>
