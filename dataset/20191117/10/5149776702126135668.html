      <h1>Could Nottingham Forest's arch-rivals Derby County lose manager Phillip Cocu?</h1>
      <h2>Cocu signed a four-year deal with Nottingham Forest's arch-rivals in July to take over from Frank Lampard</h2>

      <p>Phillip Cocu could become of interest to Feyenoord next summer, according to reports in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Frank Arnesen has been appointed the Rotterdam side's new sporting director and Dutch media outlet <a href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/sport/frank-arnesen-de-nieuwe-technisch-directeur-van-feyenoord-die-voor-een-cultuuromslag-moet-zorgen~b2fd5838/?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.derbycounty.news%2Fnews%2Ffeyenoord-could-reportedly-come-in-for-derby-county-boss-phillip-cocu-next-summer-amid-close-links%2F">de Volkskrant</a> reckon he could make a move for the Derby County boss.</p>
      <p>The report states that Arnesen, who left Anderlecht in October, wanted to take Cocu to the Belgian club before opting for Manchester City's Vincent Kompany.</p>
      <p>Cocu signed a four-year deal with <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>'s arch-rivals in July to take over from Frank Lampard, who left for Chelsea in the summer.</p>
      <p>Former Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat is currently in charge of the club, but the 72-year-old is only there until the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Arnesen was PSV's sporting director while Cocu was in his first stint as a player at PSV and the Rams boss has quite the pedigree in Eredivisie management.</p>
      <p>He won three top-flight titles for PSV as a manager and Chris van der Weerden - his assistant at Pride Park - is Arnesen's son-in-law, further strengthening the ties between Arnesen and Cocu.</p>
      <p>Cocu has Derby in 16th in the Championship table after 16 matches, winning five, losing the same amount and drawing six.</p>
