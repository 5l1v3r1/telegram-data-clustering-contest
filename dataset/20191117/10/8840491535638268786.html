      <p>MAYO ace Rachel Kearns has been honoured with a TG4 Ladies  GAA All-Star Award following a memorable year.</p>
      <p>The Crossmolina Lahardane MacHale Rovers forward was presented with the accolade at a gala ceremony in Dublin last night.</p>

      <p>Mayo GAA picked up two other awards at the event, Niamh Kelly was recipient of the 'Score of the Season' for her stunning goal against Galway in the championship while Christina Heffernan received the Hall of Fame award.</p>
