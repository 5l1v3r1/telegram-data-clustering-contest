      <p>Where has the electric <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%C4%9Flama">saz</a> been all my life? Terribly missing! A friend who knows I’m learning Turkish turned me on to this psychedelic rock band, though that description falls very short of what these musicians are capable of. BaBa ZuLa were founded in Istanbul more than 20 years ago and their members describe themselves as an “art group”. Sounds that seem recognisable and retro, and traditional Turkish instruments, are supercharged and given high-definition – the effect is strange, elating and brilliant. Listening while driving is definitely recommended, even if the fugue state means a lot of missed exits.</p>
      <h3>2. Film</h3>

      <p>This live-action Spanish movie won the short film Palme d’Or at Cannes in 2016 and it’s a remarkable piece of cinema that overhauls the cynical soul within 15 minutes. Luna and Diego work alternate day and night shifts in a parking garage, monitoring traffic via surveillance cameras. After an accidental piece of footage is seen, an astonishing, beautiful relationship develops. Should we be cautious about tales that suggest quotidian lives and jobs can be quit for something less ordinary and solitary? Or should we celebrate the idea of expressionism and connectivity and possible liberation of the spirit? I like the second option.</p>
      <h3>3. Poetry</h3>
      <h3><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/17/surfacing-kathleen-jamie-review">Kathleen Jamie</a>, Selected Poems</h3>

      <p>I’ve mentally carried around Jamie’s poems for decades, used them as invocations on planes, as epigraphs, and given away copies of her collections. I particularly like fearless female writers – and she is unmistakably that. The narrative voices, or consciousnesses, of her poems, while often humble within the landscapes they inhabit, are intrepid, observant, inquiring and perceptive. But to categorise Jamie as a nature writer is reductive – her poems are philosophical and political; they ignite radical thought and seem to me totally no-nonsense, like tonic doses of truth.</p>
      <h3>4. Philosophy</h3>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://humanism.org.uk/">Humanists UK</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I am about to renew my membership. In these divided times, I think we’re more compelled to question and think about our beliefs and values. I admire the pluralistic, realistic approach of the organisation and its human rights campaigns. The basic philosophy of humanism attempts to understand the universe through reason and inclusion, puts human welfare at the centre of morality and creates meaning in life in the here and now.</p>

      <p>One of my favourite artists is <a href="https://www.carollake.co.uk/">Carol Lake</a>. Her botanical textiles and paintings are vibrant and extraordinary. She’s teamed up with the Plant Den in Norwich and her studio shop is now a living canvas of exotic greenery and art, a reminder that nature can improve life. Candles scent the rooms like a musky autumn forest and the foliage has a dreamlike arboreal feel, so you feel like you’ve travelled whenever you’ve been there. Their collaboration is the perfect antidote to high-street chains.</p>

      <h3>6. Nonfiction</h3>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/28/who-owns-england-guy-shrubsole-review-land-ownership">Who Owns England? by Guy Shrubsole</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Next on my reading list is this much-awaited, provocative book. While researching a novel about the reintroduction of wolves to Britain, I became interested in land ownership and the need for fundamental reform in relation to wealth, rights and environmentalism. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andy-wightman">Andy Wightman</a>’s research into Scottish land ownership was really important. Thanks to the push towards transparency and freedom of information, we are beginning to see the reality of where power and money lie. Books like this perform a public service and are especially relevant in relation to Brexit debates, sovereignty and entitlement.</p>
