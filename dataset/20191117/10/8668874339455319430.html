      <h1>Tipuric offered massive deal by Bristol Bears - reports</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:55:30+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:55</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Cameron</a></address>
      <p>Star Welsh flanker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales/players/justin-tipuric/">Justin Tipuric</a> has been offered a massive deal by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bristol">Bristol</a> Bears – according to UK media sources.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.therugbypaper.co.uk/">The Rugby Paper</a></i> report that Pat Lam’s Bears want the Welsh breakdown specialist and have offered Tipuric a £500,000 deal to make the move across the Severn.</p>
      <p>The Ospreys – even with the benefit of a WRU National Dual Contract – would be unable to compete with such a figure.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old has 72 Welsh caps, meaning he can avail of the Wales’ Senior Player Selection Policy and continue to represent his country.</p>
      <p>Lam is eager to lure the backrow to Bristol, but he may have to compete with a number of French clubs who are also chasing the Trebanos man.</p>

      <p>Since making his Ospreys debut in November 2009 as a second-half replacement in a Liberty Stadium Anglo-Welsh tie against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/northampton">Northampton</a> Saints, Tipuric has gone on to make 168 regional appearances, his tally of 29 tries the highest by an Ospreys forward.</p>
      <p>Tipuric made his Welsh test debut against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/argentina">Argentina</a> in Cardiff on 20 August, 2011.</p>
      <p>At the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> 2019 he captained Wales for the first time in his test career, against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup/teams/uruguay">Uruguay</a> in their final pool stage game.</p>
      <p>He played in all five of Wales’ 2015 <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> games, starting in the contests against Uruguay and Australia. He also represented Wales at sevens in the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games.</p>
