      <p>Students at Santa Ynez Valley Charter School began the school year collecting used shoes in support of Soles4Souls, a nonprofit enterprise that provides relief and support through the distribution of footwear to adults and children in need. Through this endeavor Charter students learned that in developing countries a pair of shoes can enable children to walk to school and can be the difference in allowing adults to get to work. Students rummaged through closets and asked family members if they had shoes that were no longer used. Once collected, the shoes are sent all over the world in hopes of creating opportunities for others. <br/> <br/>3rd Grade students in teacher Lauren Dalton’s class determined the final count and prepped the shoes to be shipped to Soles4Souls. ‘We set a school goal of donating 100 pairs of shoes within six weeks. After all contributions we have received 268 pairs of shoes with six of our grades reaching 100% participation. This is definitely something to be proud of!’ said Ms. Dalton. <br/> <br/>Pictured are students Brianna Uribe and Danaka Cantrell who were among the 3rd graders tasked with organizing the shoes after they were donated. ‘I learned that other people need shoes more than we do and that we can give stuff to people that they really need,’ said Brianna. ‘My favorite part was sorting all the tiny little pairs.’ Danaka added: ‘We’re donating to give other people care. Some of the shoes have memories but others were almost brand new. We had pairs that were the same, too, so if there are triplets they could probably have them.’<br/> <br/>Volunteering and community service are an integral part of the founding vision of Santa Ynez Valley Charter School, now in its 20th year as an independent public school of choice. The K-8 school was founded to work collaboratively to create a challenging and supportive educational environment. </p>
