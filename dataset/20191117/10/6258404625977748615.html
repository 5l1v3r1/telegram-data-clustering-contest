      <p><a href="https://hothardware.com/news/best-buy-and-amazon-black-friday-deals">Black Friday</a> is nearly upon us, though as we have seen in recent years, the deals and bargains are rolling in ahead of time. We are not just talking about <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/best-buy-black-friday">previews</a>, either, but actual sales. Over at Walmart, for example, you can score a 70-inch smart TV with a 4K resolution, support for high dynamic range (HDR), and a built-in Roku streamer for a $499.99.<br/><br/>That is a banging price for 70 inches of real estate. The <b><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/ELEMENT-70-Series-4K-2160P-UHD-ROKU-Smart-LED-TV-E4SW7019RKU/632565655">Element 70-inch 4K Roku Smart TV for $499.99</a></b> has a list price of $798.00, so it's discounted nearly $300 right now. This also matches the lowest price we have ever seen this model go for.<br/><br/>Here are some specs at a glance...</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Diagonal Panel Size:</b> 70 inches</li>
        <li><b>Aspect Ratio:</b> 16:9</li>
        <li><b>Panel Resolution: </b>3840x2160 (4K)</li>
        <li><b>Brightness: </b>330 cd/m<sup>2</sup></li>
        <li><b>Dynamic Contrast Ratio:</b> 4,000:1</li>
        <li><b>Viewing Angle:</b> 160 x 150 degrees</li>
        <li><b>Response Time:</b> 8ms</li>
        <li><b>Panel Refresh Rate:</b> 60Hz (120Hz effective)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At just 330 nits, the brightness level is not going to make <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/hdr">HDR</a> content truly shine. You're basically paying for size and Roku-based smart functionality. That said, one of the user reviews states is titled, "Huge, Bright, Vibrant!," with the user saying, "awesome picture so far!!"Â  Take from that what you will.</p>

      <p>Connectivity options on this model include three HDMI ports (ARC support) and one each of the following: analog/digital TV tuner, composite video, LAN, USB, PC audio in, headphone, and optical digital output.<br/><br/>Based on the pictures, the legs on this model are spread pretty far apart, so make sure your TV stand is wide enough to accommodate this set. The dimensions are listed at 61.54 x 38.23 x 12.44 inches, and it weights 45.19 pounds.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/ELEMENT-70-Series-4K-2160P-UHD-ROKU-Smart-LED-TV-E4SW7019RKU/632565655">Go here</a> or hit the link in the Via field to snag this deal.</p>
