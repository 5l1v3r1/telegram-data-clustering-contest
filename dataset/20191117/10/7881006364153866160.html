      <p><b>Katihar</b>: Union Minister Giriraj Singh on Saturday said the time has come for him to take retirement from politics and assured that he will do so once a law to control population control is implemented.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters here, Singh said that construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya and population control were two main aims of his political career.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"My task to build Ram Temple in Ayodhya has come to an end. The time has come to retire for people like me. I will retire from politics once a rule to control population growth kicks in," the minister said.</p>
      <p>Singh, who is 67-year-old, is best known for making controversial comments and has been a strong advocate for measures for controlling population rise in the country.</p>
      <p>Notably, BJP has a policy not to field its leaders in elections who are more than 75 years of age.</p>
      <p>Last month, he participated in a yatra organised to spread awareness for population control and said that there was a need to check the rise in population in the country.</p>
      <p>Earlier in January, the minister suggested that certain communities were especially responsible for the rise in population.</p>
