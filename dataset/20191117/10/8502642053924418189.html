      <p>BEIJING, Nov 17 (Reuters) -</p>
      <p>* China and some Asian countries recently reached agreement on control and prevention of a destructive pest at an international industry workshop in Kunming, the Agriculture Ministry said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>* Eleven countries including Cambodia, Japan, Indonesia and Laos agreed to carry out regional joint monitoring of armyworm and establish information exchange mechanism, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China.</p>
      <p>* The countries also vowed to strengthen policy and financial support on the treatment of armyworm, the agricultural ministry said.</p>
      <p>* Fall armyworm, which feasts in large numbers on the leaves and stems of many plant species, can infest and damage hundreds of hectares of crops in a single night.</p>
      <p>* Bangladesh, Cambodia and Laos have suffered severe corn damage from armyworm this year. China also sees 1.1 million hectares of its land infested by the pest, according to the agricultural ministry. (Reporting by Min Zhang and Norihiko Shirouzu, editing by Louise Heavens)</p>
