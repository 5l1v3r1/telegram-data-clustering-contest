      <p>A Bilborough road has been closed while the council assesses the risk of a large tree falling down.</p>
      <p>Workers from Via East Midlands, who are responsible for the county roads, are currently at the scene.</p>
      <p>They have been dealing with the risk of "a large tree falling into the carriageway" at the A6002 Bilborough Road / Woodhouse Way junction with Strelley Road at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Bilborough</a>.</p>
      <p>The road is closed while the work is carried out.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/traffic-travel">Nottinghamshire County Council</a> said: "Our highways inspectors are re-opening roads where it is safe to do so.</p>
      <p>"Please be aware that the situation is continually changing. Please drive with extreme caution."</p>
