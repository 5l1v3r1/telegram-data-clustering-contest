      <p>LONDON — Foreign minister Dominic Raab said on Sunday it was not “remotely likely” that Britain would leave the European Union without agreeing a free trade deal at the end of a post-Brexit transition period.</p>
      <p>The governing Conservatives, who are hoping to win a majority in parliament at a Dec. 12 election to push through the Brexit deal Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed with Brussels, have said they will not extend the transition period.</p>
      <p>Asked by BBC TV if Britain could leave without a deal, Raab said: “No … I don’t think it’s remotely likely.” (Reporting by Kylie MacLellan, editing by Louise Heavens)</p>
