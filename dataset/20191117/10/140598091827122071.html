      <h1>Black Friday TV deals 2019: the best predictions so far</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:29:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:29</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Russell, Hannah Daly</a></address>
      <p>If this year’s <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/black-friday-2019-deals-when-best-sales-start-uk-shops/">Black Friday </a>is anything like the last, there are sure to be some great deals on TVs. In <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/did-black-friday-get-name-history-behind-biggest-sales-event/">last year’s sales</a>, there was as much as £1000 off some models.</p>
      <p>The Black Friday sales in November are a chance to upgrade your television - whether for a bigger screen or for better picture quality (an OLED instead of an LED). And, due to the huge savings to be made, it’s a relatively guilt-free experience.</p>
      <p>While this year’s discounts have not yet been announced, we have analysed last year’s sales and looked at TV retailers’ trends, to predict the best TV deals for Black Friday 2019. As an overview, a lot of last year’s sales items were 4K Ultra High Definition models with HDR and we predict retailers will be selling more up-to-date versions of these models this year.  </p>
      <p>For the specific models to look out for during the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-black-friday-deals-2019-uk-what-offers-discounts-where/">deals</a>, we have compiled the below guide, focusing on some of the major TV brands. We have also included a jargon-busting guide to screen sizes, smart TVs and the difference between LED and OLED, to prepare you for buying a new TV in the 2019 Black Friday sales. </p>
      <h3>Predictions on the best TV deals for Black Friday 2019</h3>
      <h4>LG </h4>
      <p>During last year’s Black Friday sales, LG had impressive discounts on three of their Smart LED TVs with 4K Ultra HD: The 43-inch 43UK6470PLC, the 49-inch 49UK6400PLF and the 65-inch 65SK8000PLB.</p>
      <p>This year we predict another round of sales on LG smart TVs, including the new 65-inch LG <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3090&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.very.co.uk%2Flg-lg-65um7660planbsp65-inch-4k-active-hdr-ultra-hd-tv-with-advanced-colour-enhancer%2F1600371149.prd">65UM7660PLA</a> model, which is already offered at a £500 discount at very.co.uk. LG has really pushed to expand its selection Smart TVs (there are now 27 on offer) and we predict that the AI-enhanced ThinQ TVs, with Google Assistant built in, will feature in this year’s sales - the 50-inch <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Ftv-and-home-entertainment%2Ftelevisions%2Ftelevisions%2Flg-50um7600plb-50-smart-4k-ultra-hd-hdr-led-tv-with-google-assistant-10191776-pdt.html">LG 50UM7600PLB</a> is already in the sales at Currys.</p>
      <p>The new LG NanoCell range (4K Ultra HD TVs with HDR) is already being sold at a reduced price at Currys - including the 49-inch  <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Ftv-and-home-entertainment%2Ftelevisions%2Ftelevisions%2Flg-49sm8600pla-49-smart-4k-ultra-hd-led-tv-with-google-assistant-10192664-pdt.html">LG 49SM8600PLA</a>, which has a £350 discount, and the 65-inch <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Ftv-and-home-entertainment%2Ftelevisions%2Ftelevisions%2Flg-65sm9010pla-65-smart-4k-ultra-hd-hdr-led-tv-with-google-assistant-10191925-pdt.html">LG 65SM9010PLA</a>, which has dropped £1000 in price since June.</p>
      <h4>Samsung</h4>
      <p>Last year, there were some great deals on Samsung’s Ultra HD sets - including the NU8000,  UE43NU7020 NU7000 and 6 Series UE65MU6200. All of these were 4K models, and we can probably expect more 4K models to be on sale this year, as well as Smart TVs - such as the 50-inch <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Ftv-and-home-entertainment%2Ftelevisions%2Ftelevisions%2Fsamsung-ue50ru7470uxxu-50-smart-4k-ultra-hd-hdr-led-tv-with-bixby-10191729-pdt.html">UE50RU7470UXXU</a> (and its 55-inch and 65-inch counterparts) which are already being sold at a reduced price at Currys. </p>
      <p>This year, however, we predict that the deals will also spread to some of Samsung’s QLED devices, as these will be a year old by Black Friday 2019. There are already savings to be made on the QE55Q80RATXXU 55" Smart 4K Ultra HD HDR QLED TV, which you can buy at a discounted rate from either <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Ftv-and-home-entertainment%2Ftelevisions%2Ftelevisions%2Fsamsung-qe55q80ratxxu-55-smart-4k-ultra-hd-hdr-qled-tv-with-bixby-10191540-pdt.html">Currys</a> or <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fsamsung-qe65q80r-2019-qled-hdr-1500-4k-ultra-hd-smart-tv-65-inch-with-tvplus-freesat-hd-apple-tv-app-eclipse-silver%2Fp4137279">John Lewis</a>.</p>
      <p>A number of Samsung's other QLED TVs have also been dropping in price over the year, including the 43-inch <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Ftv-and-home-entertainment%2Ftelevisions%2Ftelevisions%2Fsamsung-qe43q60ratxxu-43-smart-4k-ultra-hd-hdr-qled-tv-with-bixby-10191566-pdt.html">QE43Q60RATXXU</a>, the 75-inch <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fsamsung-qe75q70r-2019-qled-hdr-1000-4k-ultra-hd-smart-tv-75-inch-with-tvplus-freesat-hd-apple-tv-app-slate-black%2Fp4047638">QE75Q70R</a> and the iconic model, <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fsamsung-the-frame-2019-qled-art-mode-tv-with-no-gap-wall-mount-55-inch%2Fp4169224">The Frame</a>. So keep your eyes peeled for further reductions on these during the Black Friday sales. </p>
      <h4>Toshiba</h4>
      <p>In the past, Toshiba’s 4K TVs were seen as a bit of a joke, as they were the only brand to launch an ultra HD TV without HDR support. Which sort of defeats the point. </p>
      <p>But now Toshiba has truly joined the big boys, and includes HDR on their 4K models. Last year, there was a discount on the 75-inch 75U6863DB, which had 4K Ultra HD as well as HDR and all the features of a Smart TV.</p>
      <p>So, what can we expect from the tech giants this year? In effect, we predict they will get the ball rolling on more of their 4K Ultra HD Smart TVs that include HDR. The 55-inch <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Toshiba-55UL5A63DB-55-Inch-Ultra-HD-Freeview/dp/B07SJ8NBY9/?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">55UL5A63DB</a> model and the 49-inch <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Toshiba-49UL5A63DB-49-Inch-Ultra-HD-Freeview/dp/B07SJ8ND79/?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">49UL5A63DB</a>, for instance, are both already available at a discounted price on <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/amazon-black-friday-2019-best-deals-when-early-sale-start-uk/">Amazon</a>.</p>
      <h4>Virgin Media</h4>
      <p>In recent years, Virgin Media has launched a range of Black Friday deals, including some great discounts on their TV, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/predictions-best-mobile-phone-deals-black-friday-cyber-monday/">phone</a> and broadband bundles. Even better, the company has been known to offer additional free gifts to those who make a purchase during the sales.</p>
      <p>As well as gaming and mobile phone offers, the television, landline and internet provider previously reduced their Full House Bundle, including fibre broadband and more than 300 TV channels, from £56 to £46 per month. </p>
      <p>Those looking for a new TV package don't have to wait much longer for 2019 deals either, as a number of early Black Friday 2019 deals can now be found on <a href="https://www.virginmedia.com/shop/black-friday-deals#cable">Virgin Media's website</a>. This includes their bigger bundle TV and broadband package, which has been reduced from £62 to £45 a month (for the first 12 months). </p>
      <h4>NOW TV</h4>
      <p>Last Black Friday, NOW TV launched offers on their passes, with two months of entertainment for the price of one and 12 months reduced from £95 to £45. </p>
      <p>The 12 month kids pass was also reduced from £47 to £15, while a two month Sky Sports pass was on offer for £179, down from £305. </p>
      <p>In addition to discounted entertainment passes, this year we predict NOW TV will cut the price of their <a href="https://www.nowtv.com/smart-tv-stick">Smart Stick</a> and <a href="https://www.nowtv.com/tv-smart-box">Smart Box</a> devices.  </p>
      <h3>Other deals to look out for </h3>
      <p>Some of the best TV deals last year were on products from Hitachi, Panasonic and Philips, so we can expect some equally impressive deals for Black Friday 2019.</p>
      <p>The 43-inch <b>Hitachi</b> Smart 4K Ultra HD TV was on sale last year, and we can predict sales on their newer Smart TV models this year. In particular, we expect the new L series of Hitachi TVs, which are Smart TVs with HDR, 4K Ultra HD and Dolby Audio, will be on sale - the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/2490126/type/dlg/sid/customid/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/2007991">43-inch</a>, <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/2490126/type/dlg/sid/customid/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/3634837">50-inch</a> and <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/2490126/type/dlg/sid/customid/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/1932957">55-inch</a> models are already having their prices slashed at <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/argos-black-friday-2019-deals-best-sale-predictions-toys-smart-home/">Argos</a>. </p>
      <p>The 55-inch <b>Panasonic </b>TX-55FZ802B OLED HDR 4K Ultra HD Smart TV was in the sales last year, and we predict that the <a href="https://www.panasonic.com/uk/consumer/televisions/4K-OLED-TV/tx-65fz952b.html">65-inch version</a> of the model will be in the sales this year, as Panasonic has recently released a new OLED line of TVs. These OLED TVs are new to 2019 and thus fairly expensive (the 55-inch <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fpanasonic-tx-55gz2000b-2019-oled-hdr-4k-ultra-hd-smart-tv-55-with-freeview-play-technics-tuned-speakers-dolby-atmos-ultra-hd-premium-certified-graphite-black%2Fp4255257">TX-55GZ2000B</a> costs £3,999, for instance) so prices might be dropped to entice more customers. </p>
      <p><b>Philips</b>, too, is jumping on the OLED trend. Last year, the 55-inch 55POS9002/05 OLED TV, with 4K Ultra HD, was in the sales, and already Currys is offering Philips OLED models (such as the 65-inch <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Ftv-and-home-entertainment%2Ftelevisions%2Ftelevisions%2Fphilips-65oled803-12-65-smart-4k-ultra-hd-hdr-oled-tv-10187054-pdt.html">65OLED803/12</a> at a discounted price) </p>
      <h3>What to look for when buying a TV</h3>
      <p>Buying a television is a huge investment - not just from a financial perspective, but also because it takes prime position in your living room, the heart of any home.</p>
      <p>As such, you need to take a lot into consideration if you want to buy a new TV in the Black Friday sales. That’s why we have compiled this guide to help you navigate screen sizes, sound quality and to untangle the technical jargon (OLED, QLED and LED). </p>
      <h4>Screen size</h4>
      <p>While bigger isn’t always better, it’s worth noting that manufacturers often reserve their premium OLED and QLED models for larger screen sizes. As such, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/tech/best-4k-ultra-hd-tvs/">Telegraph writer Jack Rear</a> recommends going for a TV that’s at least 55-inches (NB: this is the distance from the bottom left to the top right of the screen, not its width). </p>
      <p>The screen should be parallel to your eyes, with no more than a 15-degree tilt upwards or downwards, or a 40-degree angle left or right.</p>
      <h4>Picture quality: What is 4K and Ultra HD?</h4>
      <p>The term 4K refers to ultra high-definition picture quality, and it is interchangeable with the term Ultra HD (or UHD on some models). A 4K Ultra HD has a premium screen resolution, with eight million pixels in total - which is four times as many as a HD TV. This means you get a crisper picture on the screen.</p>
      <p>In general, you should aim for a 4K television, as they are the highest-quality televisions - aside from the 8K televisions. </p>
      <p>However, 8K televisions aren’t really supported by the majority of broadcasters, and you can’t stream 8K or even buy 8K Blu-Rays. There are <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/tech/best-8k-televisions/">only two 8K models on the market</a> thus far - although LG has announced it has two models on the horizon. </p>
      <p>Until 8K becomes more mainstream, however, it’ best to stick to 4K TVs. Nearly all of these models have the ability to ‘upscale’ standard HD content, and premium 4K models might include HDR (High Dynamic Range), a contrast-boosting systems that makes colours more vivid on the screen. </p>
      <p>You may see other terms when researching a TV - such as “Full HD” and “HD Ready”. To clear up any confusion, the below is a hierarchy of TVs, ranked from the best picture quality to the worst:  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>8K</li>
        <li>4K/Ultra HD</li>
        <li>Full HD</li>
        <li>HD Ready</li>
        <li>Standard Definition</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Other terms to know: OLED, QLED and LED</h4>
      <p>The brightness of the TV screen depends on whether it is an LED, OLED or QLED device. An LED television uses a backlight and turns off areas of light during dark scenes. If you combine this with a HDR, you can get better screen resolution because of the contrast of colours. </p>
      <p>OLED (Organic Light Emitting Device) TVs have a more complex system. The pixels in these TVs emit their own light when electricity passes through, as opposed to relying on a backlight for brightness. As such, the pixels turn off their own colour during dark scenes - so dark colours appear darker and bright colours appear stronger. This method also means that OLED devices have a lower power consumption thn LED TVs.</p>
      <p>QLED (Quantum Dot Light Emitting Diode) technology was designed by Samsung and announced in 2018. QLED televisions use particles that are able to radiate far more colours at a greater brightness, as they have a microscopic particle filter. </p>
      <h4>What is a Smart TV?</h4>
      <p>A Smart TV will incorporate apps, catch-up services, streaming channels (such as Netflix and Youtube), and will give you access to the internet.</p>
      <h4>Sound</h4>
      <p>As screen size continues to get thinner, there is less space on the models for front-facing speakers. Therefore, we suggest either investing in a model with Dolby Atmos sound (for a cinematic effect) or <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/0/best-tv-soundbars-buy/">finding a soundbar</a> - which are usually in the Black Friday sales, too. </p>
