      <p>Former Australian rugby star Israel Folau told a crowd of worshippers at a church in Sydney that the bush fires devastating huge swathes of the country can be blamed on same sex marriage and abortion.</p>
      <p>Firefighters are battling 120 bushfires across the country with temperatures set to rise well above 40 degrees Celsius on Sunday. Queensland authorities have also issued emergency warnings for part of the state, where nearly 70 fires were burning.</p>
      <p>In New South Wales, 303 homes have been lost in the past week. There were 56 fires burning across the state with nearly half yet to be contained, NSW Rural Fire Services said.</p>
      <p>Footage has emerged of Folau – who had his AU$4 million (£2,113,826) Rugby Australia contract torn up after homophobic Facebook posts – delivering his latest message at the Church of Jesus Christ in Kenthurst in the north-west of Sydney on Sunday.</p>

      <p>In the sermon, which can be viewed on the church’s Facebook page, Folau said he believed that the bush fires were God speaking to Australia.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘What you see out there in the world – it’s only a little taste of what God’s judgement is like. The news is saying these bush fires are the worst we’ve ever seen in Australia – they haven’t seen anything.</p>
      <p>‘God is speaking to us. Speaking to you to repent and to turn away from this.’</p>
      <p>Folau told the packed church that same-sex marriage and abortion were evil in the eyes of God although society viewed them as acceptable.</p>

      <p>The first Australian athlete to be sacked for expressing his religious beliefs is no stranger to controversy.</p>
      <p>In June, he said transgender children were being allowed to go through treatment despite ‘not even knowing what they are doing’.</p>

      <p>He added: ‘This is what the devil is trying to do, to instill into the government, into this world, into society, and it is slowly happening.’</p>
      <p>Folau is suing Rugby Australia for unlawfully terminating his contract and is seeking AU$10million in damages.</p>
