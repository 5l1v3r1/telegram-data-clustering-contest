      <h1>10 of the best app deals we're featuring ahead of Cyber Monday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">StackCommerce</a></address>
      <p>Let's pit the pair of post-Thanksgiving sale days against each other: Black Friday versus Cyber Monday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/black-friday-cyber-monday-shopping-tips/">Black Friday</a> has been around for longer and is therefore more widely known. While it is associated with massive discounts and barrel scraping prices, it also conjures images of lines, fights, stampedes, and sleeping in a cot outside <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/best-buy-black-friday-2019-ad-scan/">Best Buy</a>.</p>
      <p>Cyber Monday, on the other hand, is younger and a shade more obscure. Even so, it's still synonymous with big savings. Better yet, big savings that can be purchased without even leaving the couch. (Though to be fair, you can get lots of Black Friday deals without leaving the couch too.)</p>
      <p>In the spirit of Cyber Monday's dedication to online consumption, here are the best deals on top-selling apps and software in the Mashable Shop a full two weeks early.</p>
      <p>
