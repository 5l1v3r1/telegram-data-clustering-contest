      <p>The coach of an Italian junior league team was sacked on Saturday for inflicting a humiliating 27-0 defeat on their opponents.<br/><br/>Paolo Brogelli, president of Invictasauro, a team based in Grosseto, Tuscany, slammed his team's win over rivals Marina Calcio as "disrespectful."<br/><br/>"We learned with amazement and regret the score of the match in which our junior team scored 27 goals," Brogelli said in a statement reported in the Italian press.<br/><br/>"The values of youth team football are antithetical to such a thing.<br/><br/>"The opponent must always be respected and today it has not happened. As president I sincerely apologize to the Marina team. Our board has decided, unanimously, to sack (coach) Mr. Riccini.<br/><br/>"Our coaches have a duty to train and, above all, to educate children. This has not happened today."</p>
