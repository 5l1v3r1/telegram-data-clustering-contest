        <b>The National Federation of Public and Social Workers' Unions have scheduled a national strike of non-teaching workers in schools on 29 November to protest the "chronic shortage" of these officials.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“This is a national problem for which we demand from the new PS Government the political responsibility of immediately ensuring a universal and inclusive public school with respect for workers and students' rights and the implementation of a human resources policy that solves, long-term, chronic shortage of non-teaching workers,” the federation said in a statement.</p>
      <p>In this sense, the federation decided to call a national strike of the non-teaching workers of the groupings of schools and non-grouped public schools for next November 29th.</p>
      <p>The union structure underlines that the lack of non-teaching staff has been dragging on "unsolved for years, despite promises from successive PS, PSD and CDS governments and that this school year has worsened."</p>
      <p>This situation, unions point out, has been demonstrated through the “struggle developed by the whole school community: unions and workers, parents and students associations with the closure of schools across the country”.</p>
      <p>The National Federation of Public and Social Workers' Unions also calls for an end to the precariousness and integration of the current precarious workers, the immediate hiring of over 6000 workers for the staff”.</p>
      <p>It also calls for "a new ordinance of ratios and salary and functional dignity, the end of the process of disenfranchisement of the Central State and decentralization \ municipalization of the public school, a universal, inclusive and quality public school".</p>
