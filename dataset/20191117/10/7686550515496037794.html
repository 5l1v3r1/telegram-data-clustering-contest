        <figcaption>A look back at the career history of new Cardiff City manager <b>Neil Harris</b></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Cardiff City have appointed Neil Harris as Neil Warnock's successor.</p>
      <p>Last Monday <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Bluebirds</a> chiefs decided that now was the best time to part ways with their veteran manager, and Warnock left the club by mutual consent.</p>
      <p>A swift managerial hunt ensued, and six days later, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/breaking-neil-harris-cardiff-city-17267157">Harris was announced</a> .</p>
      <p>The news <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-neil-harris-manager-17268364">wasn't universally heralded</a> but the new man should be given the opportunity to prove himself.</p>
      <p>Harris' career in the dugout is confined to his time at Millwall, and while he was in charge at The Den he gave a <a href="https://www.coachesvoice.com/a-step-back/">fascinating interview to The Coaches' Voice</a> , charting his rise from player through to under-23s coach then full-time manager.</p>
      <p>In the wide-ranging discussion Harris reveals what he and his assistant David Livermore want from their players, giving an insight into his own coaching philosophy.</p>
      <p>"I had that desire," he said.</p>
      <p>"You can’t make it up, and you certainly can’t make it up at this club. There’s having the winning mentality, the desire to want to win, and then there’s doing it in a Millwall shirt. You will lose games, and you will get criticised, but you’ve got to be able to take it. To have that extra edge, that hardness about your shell. That’s what David Livermore and I look for in our players now. We want them to be stubborn, resilient, nasty… but top lads too.</p>
      <p>"Kenny Jackett was the manager when I came back to the club. I’d just started doing my coaching badges, so was getting to a stage where I was really interested in what was being said. As coaches, Kenny and the late, great Ray Harford were the best I worked under when it came to delivering a message. They both kept things so simple. Was it because they weren’t going into much depth, or was it because they didn’t want to overcomplicate things? Was it just their style? Whatever it was, it worked, and the players reacted to it.</p>
      <p>"I’ve definitely taken that on now I’m a coach. 'Don’t overcomplicate things, lads,' I say. 'We’re going to make it as easy as we can. And it’s going to work for us'."</p>
      <p>During his early career Harris was hit by the devastating news that he had testicular cancer. He fought and won his battle but Harris refuses to believe that it shaped his decision-making process.</p>
      <p>"One question is always chucked at me: did having cancer change your perspective on life?" he said.</p>
      <p>"The answer is always no. My thought process towards life has never changed. I’m still a terrible loser. Terrible. I still lose my temper and get the red mist, as I’m sure most managers would admit to.</p>
      <p>"But it has definitely made me a better person, both on and now off the pitch. I’d like to think it has made me a better man-manager, more able to talk honestly and openly to my players. Life in football can be a goldfish bowl, but nothing is ever the end of the world. Everything always has a context.</p>
      <p>"There is always time to take a moment, and relax. To take a step back."</p>
      <p>Harris will get down to work this week, with this first game in charge against Charlton taking place on Saturday.</p>
