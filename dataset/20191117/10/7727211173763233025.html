      <h1>Hidden away house that's frozen in time</h1>
      <h2>There aren't many properties like this in Merseyside</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:32:28+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/lottie-gibbons/" target="_blank">Lottie Gibbons</a></address>
      <p>A quirky bungalow has come on the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">market in Merseyside</a> that looks straight out of the 1970s.</p>
      <p>Located on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/west-derby">The Drive in West Derby</a> , this <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/property">three-bedroom house</a> is a throwback to years gone by - and is hidden behind beautiful mature climbing plants and bushes.</p>
      <p>The home, up for sale with Entwistle Green, is priced at £600,000 - a £99,950 reduction on the original asking price of £699,950.</p>

      <p>In a listing on <a href="https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/52339797?search_identifier=82fb0e3e497026360ebc62b3b5d3705c">property website Zoopla</a> , the property is described as 'the jewel in the crown as far as bungalows go' - and there certainly aren't many homes like this in Merseyside.</p>
      <p>The bungalow is just around the corner from Walker Playing Fields, West Derby Golf Club and <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-fc-training-ground-housing-17093197">Melwood Training Ground.</a></p>
      <p>It has a secure gated parking entrance leading to a leafy landscaped garden with pond, optimised for privacy.</p>
      <p>Inside, the bungalow boasts three bedrooms with the interior design scheme looking virtually unchanged for decades.</p>

      <p>Following on from a wide and welcoming entrance hall, the art deco style of the property starts with the open plan kitchen and dining area.</p>
      <p>Wooden beams and exposed brick play a central theme in the dining area which is decorated with zebra sofas and French windows.</p>
      <p>In the lounge, interesting paintings and quirky lamps brighten up the room, along with light green velvet couches.</p>

      <p>The chalet style kitchen has a comprehensive range of solid wood base and eye level units which complement the tongue and groove ceiling.</p>
      <p>Adjacent to the dining room, one of the bedroom overlooks the rear view garden which is accessible via patio doors.</p>
      <p>Storage draws that double up as seating wrap around the walls, meaning there's plenty of space for clothes.</p>
