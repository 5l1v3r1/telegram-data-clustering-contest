      <p>Sri Lanka’s former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa has declared victory in the nation’s presidential election.</p>
      <p>Sri Lanka’s ruling party presidential candidate, housing minister Sajith Premadasa, conceded defeat to Mr Rajapaksa, saying he would honour the decision of the people.</p>

      <p>Mr Rajapaksa, the campaign front-runner who served as defence secretary under his brother, ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa, pledged to restore security to the Indian Ocean island nation still recovering from terror attacks last Easter.</p>
      <p>Mr Rajapaksa announced his candidacy shortly after the terrorist attack where militants linked to the so-called Islamic State group targeted churches and high-end hotels across the island on Easter Sunday, killing 269 people. Mr Rajapaksa criticised the government for intelligence lapses and letting the security sector falter.</p>
      <p>His victory in Saturday’s vote marks the return of a family ousted from power in 2015 elections amid constant reports of nepotism, skimming off development deals with China and alleged human rights violations during the end of the decades-long war with the Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009.</p>

      <p>The election also mirrors the global trend of populist strongmen appealing to disgruntled majorities amid rising ethno-nationalism.</p>
      <p>“As we usher in a new journey for Sri Lanka, we must remember that all Sri Lankans are part of this journey. Let us rejoice peacefully, with dignity and discipline,” Mr Rajapaksa tweeted.</p>
      <p>About 15 million people were eligible to vote, and Sri Lanka’s Election Commission estimated 80% turnout after polls closed.</p>
      <p>Flanked by Buddhist monks at campaign events, Mr Rajapaksa focused his message on Sri Lanka’s majority Sinhala Buddhist population, who comprise about 70% of the island’s citizens. The second-largest group are ethnic Tamil Hindus at 12.6%, while 10% are Muslims and 8% are Christian.</p>
      <p>He accepted support from Buddhist nationalist clerics who demanded the resignation of Muslim Cabinet members and governors they said were interfering with the investigation of the Easter attacks.</p>
      <p>The Muslim politicians temporarily stepped aside.</p>

      <p>The campaign said Mr Rajapaksa’s swearing-in ceremony would take place at Anuradhapura, a city about 124 miles from Colombo and the seat of the first Sinhalese kingdom known for a sacred tree that is said to be the southern branch of the Bodhi tree in India under which Lord Buddha attained enlightenment.</p>
      <p>Though counting continued, the preliminary result reflected voting along ethnic lines, showing “a badly polarised country” that will embolden right-wing Buddhist clerics, said Kusal Perera, a political analyst and independent journalist.</p>
      <p>“A Sinhala Buddhist theocratic state has been given a people’s mandate now,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Premadasa swept the majority Tamil and Muslim districts in the country’s north and east, winning as much as 80% of the vote. In majority ethnic Sinhala areas, Mr Gotabaya secured around 60%.</p>
      <p>Sinhala Buddhists’ votes usually do not vote as a bloc, unlike Sri Lankan minorities who have supported whatever party espoused policies comparatively favourable to them.</p>
