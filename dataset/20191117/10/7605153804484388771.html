        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 17 – Since his re-appointment as Harambee Stars head coach, Francis Kimanzi is yet to register a win with the national football team, he has however set that as his target when he leads his charges to facing Togo in Monday night’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations Qualifier at the Kasarani Stadium.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kimanzi, who led Harambee Stars to their final session on the eve of the match, will be looking to build on confidence they picked away in Alexandria where they came a goal down to hold Egypt 1-1.</p>
      <p>He will be however be without injured Ayub Timbe and goal keeper Patrick Matasi with the Chinese based winger having picked a knock during the Egypt match.</p>

      <p>“The players are motivated and focused on tomorrow’s (Monday) match. We had a lot of positives to pick from our draw against Egypt. We will be looking to build on that and I am confident we will post positive results,” Kimanzi said.</p>
      <p>“Our medical team is having a look at them but I think the match will be too soon for them. We, however, have enough depth in the team,” he confirmed on Timbe and Matasi injuries.</p>
      <p>Tickets will retail at Sh200 for terraces and Sh500 for VIP and will be sold on match day at Kenya Cinema, Ngomongo Roundabout, Opposite Safari Park Hotel and outside Kasarani’s Gate 12.</p>
      <p>Since making a comeback to the national football team as head coach, Kimanzi has so far drawn two matches against Uganda in friendly and Egypt in AFCON Qualifier and lost once against Mozambique in a build up match.</p>
      <p>A win for Stars will keep alive their dream of a back-to-back qualification to the Cup of Nations to be hosted in Cameroon.</p>
