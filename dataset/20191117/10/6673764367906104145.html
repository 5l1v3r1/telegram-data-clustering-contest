      <p>For a certain generation of fans there is only one name that comes to mind when discussing the greatest of all time and that name is Chiyonofuji.</p>
      <p>The muscular yokozuna dominated inside the ring and won hearts outside it during the 1980s.</p>
      <p>Known as “the Wolf,” the undersized Chiyonofuji possessed a lethal combination of technique and fighting spirit.</p>
      <p>His atypical physique brought many new fans into the sport, and the muscular Hokkaido native became something of a sex symbol.</p>
      <p>Incredibly, in a sport that normally sees a steep decline after the age of 30, Chiyonofuji had his greatest success in his fourth decade, winning 19 of his 31 titles in his thirties.</p>
      <p>Constant shoulder dislocations stymied his progress early in his career, but Chiyonofuji remained a handsome and popular young wrestler whose win over veteran ozeki Takanohana — a man who had been known as the “Prince of the Ring” — was the first sign of a changing of the guard and led to the latter’s retirement soon afterwards.</p>
      <p>In a twist of fate, Takanohana’s teenage son defeated Chiyonofuji a decade later, signaling the end for the great yokozuna, and he too rode off into the sunset a few days later.</p>
      <p>Chiyonofuji also holds the distinction of being the only man ever to decline the high honor of being awarded one-generation elder stock under his ring name.</p>
      <p>The Sumo Association bestows such a distinction on the greatest of the great. But rather than open a stable under his own name, Chiyonofuji eventually took over Kokonoe stable.</p>
      <p>Despite holding many positions in the JSA, Chiyonofuji never earned the top job.</p>
      <p>Stablemate Hokutoumi, whose own multiple championship-winning yokozuna career was overshadowed by Chiyonofuji while they were active, surpassed his senior post-retirement and has been JSA Chairman since 2015.</p>
