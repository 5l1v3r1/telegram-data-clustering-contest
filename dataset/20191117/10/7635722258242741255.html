        <b>Support for both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil has dropped in the latest political opinion poll.</b>
      </p>
      <p>However, Sinn Féin, Labour, Independents and the Social Democrats are all up slightly in the latest Behaviour and Attitudes survey for the Sunday Times.</p>
      <p>Fine Gael is down two percentage points to 27% while Fianna Fáil is down three to 25%.</p>
      <p>The survey of 923 people, carried out between the  November 1 and 12, takes in the first few days of the Lorraine Clifford Lee Twitter scandal.</p>
      <p>According to its results, Fine Gael remains the most popular party in the country, however, the satisfaction rating for Taoiseach and party leader Leo Varadkar down 2% to 43%.</p>
      <p>Support for Micheál Martin has also fallen to 44%.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Sinn Féin is up a point to 17% and may be hoping for a further boost following this weekend's Ard Fheis.</p>
      <p>Labour is up one to 6%, the same as the unchanged Green Party.</p>
      <p>The Independent Alliance doubles its support to 4%.</p>
      <p>The Social Democrats are up one to 2%, Solidarity People Before Profit are down one to 2%.</p>
