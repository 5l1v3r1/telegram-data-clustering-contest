      <p>A paternity test revealed that a teenage girl from Hull gave birth to her rapist’s baby – disproving his claim that the horrendous ordeal was ‘fabricated’.</p>
      <p>The shocking truth only emerged once the baby was born and a DNA test was taken, revealing the child’s father was Quaser Abas, 37.</p>
      <p>He was found guilty of rape after a five-day trial at Hull Crown Court and has now been jailed for 12 years.</p>
      <p>The girl, who the court heard was abused over a short period of time, went for a routine hospital check and discovered she was 23 weeks pregnant.</p>
      <p>Abas claimed during the trial that the test was ‘contaminated’.</p>
      <p>He also suggested the testimonies given by the girl and her mother during police interviews were ‘fabricated and concocted’, according to <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/quaser-abas-raped-hull-teenager-3544330">the Hull Daily Mail</a>.</p>

      <p>Prosecuting, Mark McKone read out a victim statement from the girl, who said Abas has ‘destroyed her life’.</p>
      <p>She explained: ‘I didn’t want a baby at this age, I didn’t want it to happen the way it did.</p>
      <p>‘I was scared to tell my mum.</p>
      <p>‘When I found out I was pregnant I was shocked and scared to tell anyone and was scared about what they might say and think. I didn’t want the baby but now it is here I wouldn’t change it for the world.’</p>
      <p>The girl said she is glad she spoke out so Abas could not do the same to anyone else.</p>
      <p>Mr McKone also read out a statement from the girl’s mother, who worried that that she would resent the baby.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘I can’t speak to her about it or speak about what happened. I thought she was safe.</p>

      <p>‘I can never get over it and need to ask why he did it.</p>
      <p>‘It would have been hard enough for her to have a child, never mind at this age. He has taken her childhood away from her. She has had to grow up so fast.’</p>
      <p>The girl’s age and name is not being revealed for legal and ethical reasons.</p>
      <p>Her mum continued: ‘He’s destroyed our family.</p>
      <p>‘One day we will have to tell the child what happened. I try not to think about it because when I do I feel like I’m going to cry and I love my grandchild now it’s here but I can’t think about it because I would resent it.</p>

      <p>‘I didn’t want to be a grandmother in these circumstances.’</p>
      <p>The court was told there could still be a chance for Abas to have a relationship with the baby.</p>
      <p>Judge David Tremberg told the jury that in the future he could apply for contact, and that would be the decision of the family court rather than the criminal courts.</p>
      <p>The court was told by Matthew Burden, acting on behalf of the defence, that Abas was of ‘previous good character.’</p>
      <p>But, sentencing him to 12 years imprisonment, Judge Tremberg said: ‘You took the opportunity to rape her, having full, unprotected sexual intercourse. She told you “no” but you pressed on and she simply submitted.</p>
      <p>‘In her police interview she said she had “no words” and was “so scared”. This immature, inexperienced girl did nothing to show sexual interest in you but you took the opportunity to use her to vent your sexual energy.’</p>
      <p>The court heard the girl did not report Abas at the time but soon faced a ‘different dilemma.’</p>
      <p>Judge Tremberg continued: ‘Matters came to light because when a visit to hospital and a routine test was carried out it turned out she was 23 weeks pregnant.</p>
      <p>‘Having had her child, the DNA (proof) that you were its father was overwhelming but you continued to protest your innocence instead of showing remorse, running your case that she had somehow fabricated it and the DNA must have been contaminated.</p>

      <p>‘Confronted with the decision of what to do she decided to keep the child and that has changed the path of her life.’</p>
      <p>He said Abas was a ‘serious sex offender’ and that there will be no likelihood that he will ‘ever, ever have the opportunity to be in a similar situation again’.</p>
      <p>Abas was will serve half of his sentence in prison and half on licence in the community.</p>
      <p>He has been made subject to a restraining order against the victim and handed a sexual harm prevention order for life – meaning he cannot have any unsupervised contact with female children under the age of 16.</p>
