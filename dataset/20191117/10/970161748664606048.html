      <p>An 18-carat gold friendship ring believed to have been given as a gift by acclaimed Irish playwright Oscar Wilde has been recovered 20 years after it was stolen.</p>
      <p>Arthur Brand – dubbed the ‘Indiana Jones of the Art World’ for recovering a number of stolen pieces – teamed up with London antiques dealer William Veres who put him in touch with George Crump, a man who Brand said has ‘a decent knowledge of the London criminal underworld’.</p>
      <p>The ring, worth £35,000, was stolen during a burglary at Magdalen College, Oxford in 2002. Wilde studied there and gifted the ring to a fellow student in 1876.</p>
      <p>There were fears that the ring, shaped like a belt and buckle, had been melted down but Mr Brand managed to track it down after Mr Crump used his connections and discovered the ring had been bought in 2015.</p>

      <p>Mr Brand said the appearance of the ring had been linked to the 2015 Hatton Garden burglary and added when it was stolen, no one knew it was linked to the famous writer.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘I was given the ring right in front of the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit… which I thought was a bit of English humour.’</p>
      <p>The ring will be returned to the university next month.</p>
      <p>Mark Blandford-Baker, home bursar of Magdalen College, said he was ‘very pleased to have back a stolen item that forms part of a collection relating to one of our more famous alumni.’</p>
