      <h3>POLICE Regional Office 3 director, Brigadier General Rhodel O. Sermonia, yesterday assailed the New People’s Army for ‘shamelessly recruiting’ government scholars and other students and out-of-school youths into their movement in Central Luzon.</h3>
      <p>He lashed out at the rebel movement in the aftermath of the capture of a 33-year old former coed-turned rebel following an encounter with security forces in Rizal, Nueva Ecija last Thursday.</p>
      <p>The official said that Redsa Balatan alias ‘Ka Sining’ used to be a former student at the University of the Philippines-Extension Program in Pampanga until she was recruited by the NPA and became a political instructor of Kilusang Larangang Gerilya-Sierra Made.</p>
      <p>Sermonia said that Balatan, along with some comrades were reported to be engaging in extortion activities in Barangay Estrella in Rizal, Nueva Ecjia when they were chanced upon by patrolling Army and police troops.</p>
      <p>A gunbattle erupted between the two groups resulting in the capture of the female rebel as well as from others identified as Lizel Labo alias ‘Ka Nido,’ Carlos Aguilar alias ‘Ka Badong,’ Danilo Sagun and Ernesto Quimzon, he said.</p>
      <p>Two other suspected NPA guerrillas identified as Michael Ledesma and one alias ‘Ka Miguel’ were also killed in the firefight. Recovered from the possession of the rebels were two M-16 Baby Armalite rifles, three caliber .45 pistols, 15 long M-16 magazines, dozens of cal. 5.56 live ammunition, a hand grenade, several gadgets and suspected rebel documents.</p>
      <p>Sermonia expressed sadness for the plight of Balatan whom he said was deceived by the rebels into joining “what she thought was the solution to issues that beset the country only to be captured and wounded while engaging in shameful extortion.”</p>
      <p>The official said that the case of Balatan should serve as a lesson to Filipino youths, especially students studying in state-owned universities and colleges, that abandoning their studies in exchange for following the deceptive path of armed struggle will not only waste their chances for a bright future but will also destroy the lives of their families and loved ones.</p>
      <p>Sermonia said that in more than 50 years of communist insurgency, those young people — like Balatan — who fell into the romanticism of NPA’s protracted war were among those who actually betrayed the Filipino people for allowing themselves to become instrument of violence that only deprive the masses of the chances to achieve genuine economic development.</p>
      <p>In a statement, he also appealed to state colleges and universities administrators to become vigilant with the covert recruitment of students that happen under their noses by the NPA’s front organizations in the student sector like the League of Filipino Students, National Union of Students of Philippines, ANAKBAYAN, Karapatan, and Kabataan Party-List, which sway students to abandon their education and join the NPA.</p>
