      <p>People living in a Derbyshire neighbourhood have vented their fury after being woken by fireworks in the early hours of this morning.</p>
      <p>Residents in the Petersham area of Long Eaton say loud bangs went off between 4.30am and 6am.</p>
      <p>Posting on the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/derby-news/surrogacy-derby-3391918">Spotted: Long Eaton Facebook page</a> , one person wrote: "Anyone else hear the fireworks at 5am this morning around the College Street area?"</p>
      <p>A number of people replied, including Lindsey Danielle who said: "Yes, I did. Quite a few went off too."</p>
      <p>Several complained that the fireworks had woken them up.</p>
