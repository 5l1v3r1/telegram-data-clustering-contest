      <h3>ADOPTING a resolution seeking to use the remaining P6.97-billion rice subsidy fund for the purchase of “palay” is ample proof that the House of Representatives is sensitive to the plight of farmers.</h3>
      <p>The issue of plunging “palay” prices following the controversial liberalization of the rice industry is acknowledged to be one of the reasons why there’s demoralization among the farmers.</p>
      <p>But it is heartening to note that the state, through concerned offices and agencies, continues to look for ways to help the beleaguered farmers, who comprise the bulk of the population.</p>
      <p>“This is our malasakit (compassionate) way of ensuring that the Duterte administration is always there to help our farmers,” said Majority Leader Martin Romualdez, a lawyer by profession.</p>
      <p>House Joint Resolution (HJR) No. 22 mandates the government to directly buy palay from the farmers, using public funds from the highly-successful Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps).</p>
      <p>Instead of cash, the country’s millions of beneficiaries of 4Ps will receive rice subsidy.</p>
      <p>The resolution stemmed from HJR No. 322 filed by Romualdez and his wife, Tingog party-list Rep. Yedda Marie K. Romualdez, and HJR No. 16 of Camarines Sur Rep. LRay Villafuerte.</p>
      <p>Villafuerte lauded the House of Representatives and the Senate for passing their respective versions of a joint resolution authorizing the use of rice subsidy funds intended for beneficiaries of the Conditional Cash Transfer program.</p>
      <p>Without doubt, participatory democracy flourishes when the government acts to meet the mushrooming needs of the burgeoning population, including the farmers in the countryside.</p>
      <p>And we share the view of various quarters that members of the Philippine Senate and the House of Representatives are in the best position to help our beleaguered rice farmers.</p>
