      <h1>Amazon Black Friday deals 2019: the best early predictions for the eight-day sale </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:08:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/katie-russell/" target="_blank">Katie Russell</a></address>
      <p>It’s the Godfather of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/black-friday-2019-deals-when-best-sales-start-uk-shops/">Black Friday</a>. Amazon, the online retailing giant that brought the November sales to the UK, consistently has some of the best deals on electricals, beauty and Amazon-branded products.</p>
      <p>The company sells everything from smartphones to dog bones and there is often something for everyone across their Lightning, Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals.</p>
      <p>This year will be no different. While the online retailer has not yet revealed its discounts, we have analysed trends from last year’s sales, as well as its recent deals in their End of Summer Sale, to predict some of the best Amazon offers for Black Friday 2019.</p>
      <p>Amazon's sales are slightly earlier this year and will run for eight days - from November 22 - 29. In a statement, the online retailer claimed it would be their "biggest ever Black Friday sale" and that shoppers will be able to save "tens of millions on thousands of new deals every day".</p>
      <p>So, what can we expect the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-black-friday-deals-2019-uk-what-offers-discounts-where/">best deals</a> to be in the sales? We anticipate that, as in previous years, Amazon will primarily champion deals on their own branded products (Echo, Kindle, Fire TV stick, etc). However, they usually offer great discounts on home tech, laptops, phones and beauty products - so we have included our predictions for these categories, too.</p>
      <h3>Latest news</h3>
      <p>The Amazon Black Friday sales for 2019 will start on November 22, the retailer announced this week. In the week leading up to the main event, you can expect significant deals on slightly older models - before the main round of fresh deals over Cyber Weekend.</p>
      <p>Lightning deals are already on offer - with significant savings to be made on electronics, jewellery and more. These deals are only available for a limited time only, which is why they sell out so quickly every year.</p>
      <p>The brand's much-anticipated '<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16032496031">Home of Black Friday</a>' customer experience is also returning for the third year running in London. From November 28 to December 1, the pop-up destination will offer complimentary workshops, experiences and the chance to try out the season's must-have products. Amazon has just announced that rapper Tinie Tempah will perform an intimate concert at their Home of Black Friday event in Lambeth on November 29.</p>
      <h3>Amazon-branded products</h3>
      <p>During last year’s Black Friday sales, Amazon offered some hefty discounts on both its new and old-generation products. The year-old Fire HD 8 tablet (and its kids’ edition) were in the sales, as were the Fire TV stick and the year-old second generation of the smart speaker, Echo Spot. The new Kindle Paperwhite was also one of the brand’s top-sellers in the Black Friday sales.</p>
      <p>So, what can we expect from Amazon in the 2019 sales? We looked at the retailer's reductions from their End of Summer Sales for an idea. Here, Amazon cut prices on the third generation of Echo Dot (which was brand-new in last year’s sales and therefore didn’t have a big discount). It also reduced the price of the old generation Fire 7 and Fire HD 8 tablets and the new Fire HD 10. We can anticipate that there will be similar reductions in the Black Friday 2019 sales. </p>

        <figcaption>The Amazon Echo Dot is likely to be in the Black Friday sales this year</figcaption>

      <p>There were large discounts on the Fire TV Stick (25% off) and the newer Fire TV Stick 4K (20%) so we anticipate similar deals for the November sales. Most of the Kids Edition tablets were significantly reduced, too, with the Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet given a 35% discount, the Fire HD 8 Kids Edition Tablet sold at 27% off, and the new Fire HD 10 Kids Edition tablet with an impressive 28% discount. </p>
      <p>It’s also worth mentioning that the new Echo Show was also in the sale, as were the Echo Plus and Kindle Paperwhite.</p>
      <h3>Laptops and Tablets</h3>
      <p>Last year, Amazon had stellar deals on the 15.6-inch Lenovo IdeaPad, the Microsoft Surface laptop and the Microsoft Surface Pro 6 tablet. This year, the same products will likely be on sale at a discounted price (the Microsoft Pro 6 tablet was in the End of Summer Sale) - but we predict there will be some more deals on offer this year.</p>
      <p>In the End of Summer Sale, there were discounts on a range of ASUS, Acer and HP laptops - especially the ASUS VivoBook and HP Stream models. There were also discounts on the Microsoft Surface Book 2 and the Windows 10 Pro (which had an almost £300 discount) so these deals are likely to re-emerge for Black Friday. </p>
      <p>We also predict that there will be deals on the Lenovo tablets - specifically the Lenovo Smart Tab (which comes with Alexa) and the Lenovo YOGA tab because Amazon has already cut these prices. </p>
      <h3>Phones </h3>
      <p>If we use the End of Summer Sales as a guide, we can expect some pretty exciting deals on some brand-new phones. </p>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy 9 was a top-seller in last year’s Black Friday sales, and this year's new Samsung Galaxy 10, the Galaxy S10+ and the Galaxy S10e had up to £100 off in the End of Summer Sales - so could these feature in the Black Friday sales?</p>

      <p>We also predict there will be savings on Huawei models - as the new Y6 and Y7 models were discounted (at 16% and 26%, respectively) in the End of Summer Sales. The new Huawei Mate 20 phone was also reduced, with a significant £300 discount, so we predict this phone will also be on offer for Black Friday 2019. </p>
      <p>Other notable mentions include the Sony Xperia 10 Plus and the Nokia 1, both of which we predict will be in the November sales. </p>
      <h3>Home tech</h3>
      <p>Juicers, drills, alarm clocks, blenders and printers were all in last year’s sales - and we predict a wave of fresh offers this year. </p>
      <p>Last year, the Oral-B Genius 8000 electric toothbrush was discounted - and we anticipate great deals on other <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/tech/best-electric-toothbrushes/">electric toothbrushes</a> this year. In particular, it seems likely that Amazon will reduce the price of their Oral-B CrossAction toothbrushes (whether the Pro 2 or the Pro 650) because these are already being offered at a discounted price. The Oral-B SmartSeries 6000 CrossAction is currently being offered at £69.99 - a huge saving, considering its RRP is £229.99. </p>
      <p>Home security products also featured heavily in last year’s sales - including the Arlo Pro Security System, and both the Ring Video Doorbell Pro and the Ring Video Doorbell 2. The popular products let you answer the door from anywhere using your iOS or Android smartphone, and are growing in popularity. This year, it's possible both Ring products will be in the sales, as well as other models.</p>
      <p>Probably inspired by the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/12/14/instagram-cleaning-star-mrs-hinch-secures-lucrative-book-deal/">Mrs Hinch revolution</a>, the Shark upright vacuum cleaner was in the sales last year - and we expect the same for 2019. The Shark Upright Vacuum Cleaner Pet Hair model already has a £110 discount on Amazon. Similarly, the iRobot Roomba 960 Robot vacuum cleaner was in the 2018 sales, and we anticipate the newer 981 model to be discounted this year. Amazon is already offering £100 off. </p>
      <h3>Beauty products</h3>
      <p>One of last year’s big sellers was the Maybelline No Make Up Make Up Gift Set - probably bought by those who had already started their Christmas shopping. This year, there's likely to be discounts on other gift sets - perhaps the Glow All Night or the Eye Candy sets from Maybelline.</p>
      <p>If you're in the market for a new set of straighteners, the Remington Shine Therapy Advanced Ceramic Hair Straighteners is currently reduced, and could well be discounted further during Black Friday.  Other potential hair products may include the ghd Original IV Professional styler - as these are currently in the sales - and the BaByliss Straight and Curl Brilliance Hair Straightener, which already has a discount, too. </p>
      <h3>How to shop on Amazon this Black Friday</h3>
      <p>To prepare you for the upcoming havoc of Black Friday, we have collated some tips on how to check in and check out of Amazon, with your basket of deals, as quickly as possible.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Create a membership.</b> Be sure to register as a new customer so you can check out your items as quickly as possible when the deals start. You could even save your card details to really speed up the process.</li>
        <li><b>Sign up for Amazon Prime.</b> Amazon often incentivise their customers by giving Prime members exclusive deals and early access to thousands of ‘lightning deals’ (the ones that usually sell out the fastest) 30 minutes before the rest of the internet.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Get there early.</b> Amazon have been known to launch their Black Friday deals as much as two weeks in advance. Many last-generation tech products pop up during this time, whereas newer ones usually emerge nearer to Cyber Weekend (this year, November 30). </p>
      <p><b>Keep track of the Telegraph’s </b><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/">live coverage of Black Friday</a> - so you can find the best deals as soon as they’re on offer. </p>
      <p><b>Check out the ‘Upcoming’ page.</b> When the 2019 offers are released, Amazon’s official Black Friday micro-site should have an ‘Upcoming’ page filled with future offers and the exact time of their launch. If you clikc the ‘Watch this deal’ button on anything listed, the Amazon app will send you a notification for each item’s deal launch.</p>
      <p><b>Pre-fill your basket.</b> Some savvy shoppers swear by pre-filling their baskets with rumoured products so they can check them out as soon as the deals go live. </p>
      <p><b>Shop around.</b> While Amazon does usually have great deals, it doesn’t hurt to browse the Shopping tab on Google for a better deal. </p>
      <p><b>Check Flubit for a better deal.</b> If you've found a product you like on Amazon, and you have a spare couple of hours, enter the URL into the <a href="http://telegraph.digidip.net/visit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fflubit.com%2F&amp;ppref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;currurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fblack-friday%2F0%2F13-black-friday-shopping-hacks-how-to-shop-online-like-a-pro%2F">Flubit</a> generator - it will tell you if there's a better deal elsewhere on the internet. This can take up to three hours and Flubit, which receives a commission on each deal it facilitates, does sometimes admit that Amazon has the best price on an item. </p>
