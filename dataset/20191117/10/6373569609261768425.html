      <h2>Horrific blaze engulfed most of the student block leaving many to wonder whether the cladding was safe</h2>

      <p>A student from Plymouth was caught up in the terrifying Bolton student accommodation blaze which has again raised concerns over the dangers of cladding since the Grenfell fire.</p>
      <p>Megan Maitland, from Plymouth, is currently studying in Bolton and lived in The Cube student accommodation in Greater Manchester.</p>
      <p>Numerous videos have been circulating on social media showing the outside of the building consumed by a raging fire while firefighters struggled to battle it.</p>
      <p>Footage shows fire crews attempting to contain the blaze before it turns into a huge inferno, spreading over several floors.</p>
      <p>Posting a message on her Facebook page late last night Megan, who studied at Devonport High School for Girls and City College Plymouth, wrote: "I AM SAFE!"</p>

      <p>The student, who is currently studying Special Make-up Effects for Film and TV BDes (Hons) at Bolton University added: "With a load of people at a local Travelodge for now.</p>
      <p>"Flat went completely up in flames and have nothing. But we are all safe. Thank you so much everyone who's messaged me I will get back to you properly now. Can't f***ing believe what's happened."</p>
      <p>She added that it "wasn't just my flat, it was the whole building" which was destroyed by the fire.</p>

      <p>The blaze appears to have started in one of the higher floors of the building, although no full explanation of the cause of the fire has been made public at this stage.</p>
      <p>Initial reports suggested the fire began at around 8.30pm on Friday night. Some students said they were only alerted to it from people shouting up at their windows. As the emergency services arrived, students were evacuated.</p>
      <p>Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service stated they were called to the fire at 8.29pm on November 15 at the six-storey building on Bradshawgate, Bolton.</p>

      <p>Around 40 fire engines, three aerial appliances and specialist appliances were involved in tackling the blaze, with around 200 firefighters using multiple jets during the entire night from Friday evening into Saturday.</p>
      <p>Students were asked to register at a nearby student accommodation and contact worried family members to reassure them.</p>
      <p>Jim Hutton, Area Manager, praise his "hardworking firefighters" who he said "have worked exceptionally hard during difficult conditions and prevented the fire from spreading to an adjacent building."</p>
      <p>He said the crews divided the fire itself into four sectors of firefighting, allowing firefighters to target their efforts on particular hotspots.</p>
      <p>They battled the blaze for several hours and remained at the scene for most of Saturday damping down hotspots.</p>

      <p>Professor George E Holmes DL, President and Vice Chancellor of the University of Bolton, said: “Supporting the welfare of our students is our number one priority and we have moved swiftly to assist in any way we can.</p>
      <p>“University colleagues have worked through the night to make sure support is in place for students over the weekend.</p>
      <p>“We have assisted in ensuring students have been given temporary alternative accommodation at the Orlando student halls and in some Bolton hotels.</p>
      <p>“We have also arranged to provide necessities such as toiletries for all students affected and are opening the University over the weekend so students can be supported. We will also provide food for them.</p>
      <p>“I would like to stress that The Cube is not owned by the University of Bolton. It is owned and managed by a private landlord and the students were not on our premises when during this incident.”</p>
      <p>It has now emerged that a post-Grenfell rescue plan helped save the lives of students caught up in the fire.</p>
      <p>Following the 2017 tragedy in London, the emergency services in Greater Manchester devised a new plan to deal with major fires in tower blocks.</p>
      <p>It was implemented for the first time when a devastating fire ripped through The Cube student accommodation in Bolton town centre on Friday night.</p>

      <p>Assistant county fire officer Dave Keenan said the plan had 'undoubtedly seen the safe resolution of this incident'.</p>
      <p>His officers implemented the action plan devised by Greater Manchester's 'High Rise Taskforce' set up in the wake of Grenfell. They had been practicing the plan the day before the fire.</p>
      <p>Valeo USL, which acts as property manager of The Cube stated on their website: "Valeo USL is deeply sorry that the fire in the Cube building it operates in Bolton has displaced all of the 221 students that were resident in the building and is of course concerned about the distress and disruption that the blaze has caused to the lives of those students.</p>
      <p>"Valeo USL acts as Property Manager at the Cube letting the rooms in the building and looking after the day to day welfare of the residents. Valeo USL manages the Cube for the leaseholders and the Landlord of the site is Idealsite Ltd. </p>
      <p>"Valeo USL was not responsible for the construction of or subsequent amendments to the construction of the Cube buildings."</p>
