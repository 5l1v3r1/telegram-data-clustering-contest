      <p>Police in Hoedspruit outside Phalaborwa in Limpopo are investigating a case of culpable homicide, after nine people died in a head-on collision on the R531 near Swadini on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson, Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo says it is alleged that a Toyota 4x4 single cab bakkie collided head-on with a Toyota Avanza.</p>
      <p>He says eight people died instantly.</p>
      <p>Two others were transported to hospital, where one of them later died.</p>
      <p>Mojapelo says members of the police's endangered species unit were also called to the scene, after the discovery of a consignment of buckets full of snake skins, dried starfish, dried crabs, and other marine animals.</p>
      <p>He says these were apparently transported on the back of the bakkie, and investigations into their origin are continuing.</p>
      <p>The cause of the accident is still unknown.</p>
