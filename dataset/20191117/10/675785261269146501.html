      <h1>Man gets £3,500 added to car insurance because he took a night shift at Tesco</h1>
      <h2>They're meant to save you cash, but you need to check the small print or could be landed with a massive bill as a result of getting a car insurance black box installed in your car, warns consumer lawyer Dean Dunham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Dean Dunham, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/dean-dunham/</a></address>
      <p>Teenagers behind the wheel is a scary thought but the cost of ­insuring them can be even more ­terrifying.</p>
      <p>Getting a black box installed in their car, which relays driving ­information and statistics back to the insurer, can save a packet.</p>
      <p>The insurer then calculates the premiums based on this and can offer lower premiums if you demonstrate safe driving.</p>
      <p>This telematics box takes ­account of speed, cornering, braking, acceleration and can even detect accidents.</p>
      <p>Black box insurance sounds good for ­everyone, especially young and new ­drivers, but some readers have told me there are major flaws you need to be aware of.</p>

      <p>18-year-old Sue took out a black box policy because it was far cheaper than conventional insurance at the time.</p>
      <p>In May she received a call from the insurer asking if she was OK because the black box recorded that her ­vehicle had been in an accident.</p>
      <p>But Sue had not been involved in any incident on the road and explained this.</p>
      <p>Still, two days later, the same thing happened.</p>
      <p>Sue, from Canterbury, again explained there had been no ­accident. When it happened for a third time, the insurer cancelled the policy, stating the reason as the failure to report an ­accident.</p>

        <figcaption>Justin didn't realise his Tesco night shift would cost him extra</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>17-year-old Justin thought it made sense for him to take out a black box policy after he passed his driving test.</p>
      <p>After eight months he received a letter saying his premium was being increased by £3,500 due to his negative driving score.</p>
      <p>When he looked into this it emerged that he had been ­penalised for driving at night, something he did four days a week because he had a night job working for Tesco.</p>
      <p>Justin, from Leeds, is furious and says this was not clearly ­explained to him when he took out the policy.</p>

      <p>19-year-old Lisa took out a black box policy and now regrets it.</p>
      <p>Four months in, she changed her car and Lisa, from Ashford in Kent, was landed with a £100 bill from the insurer for moving the box to her new motor.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Dean's Top tip:</b> Before taking out a black box policy, read the terms very carefully so you know what has a negative impact, such as night driving. If you have a dispute with your insurer, lodge a claim with the <a href="https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/">Financial Ombudsman Service</a> – they have had numerous complaints.</li>
      </ul>
