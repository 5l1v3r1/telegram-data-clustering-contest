      <p>I think we can all agree passionate fans are what make football so special</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-leeds-united-promotion-3543472">The Championship</a> is regarded by many as 'the most competitive league in the world', supported by the most loyal fan bases. </p>
      <p>Each week, thousands of fans spend their hard-earned money travelling up and down the country to support their team in their droves. </p>
      <p>It's, at times, a thankless task, which makes the good times all the more rewarding.</p>
      <p>Bristol City fans are one of the best clubs across the league at filling their stadium, with the 27,000 seater Ashton Gate in the top half of biggest stadiums in the Championship. </p>
