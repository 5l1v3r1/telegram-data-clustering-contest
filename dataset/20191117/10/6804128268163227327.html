      <h1>'Can't wait!' - Chelsea fans think they know what Gareth Southgate will do against Kosovo</h1>
      <h2>The Chelsea winger could be set to make his second start for England</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:43:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:43</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Callum Hudson-Odoi is among a handful of players who could come into England's line-up for the Euro 2020 qualifier against Kosovo on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Chelsea winger was an unused substitute during Thursday's 7-0 thrashing of Montenegro, a result which sealed England's place at the European Championship next summer.</p>
      <p>Southgate is set to recall Raheem Sterling after dropping the Manchester City winger for his role in the training ground bust-up with Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>Nick Pope is also poised to start over Jordan Pickford, with Southgate wanting to hand the Burnley goalkeeper some crucial international experience.</p>
      <p>Hudson-Odoi could also be set to come into the side ahead of Jadon Sancho, leaving the England boss with a tough selection headache.</p>
      <p>But Southgate says he is delighted to be blessed with a group of young, hungry players - many of whom ply their trade for Chelsea.</p>
      <p>“But I would imagine that Sven thought the same of Beckham, Scholes, Carrick, Gerrard, Lampard,” Southgate says. “If you’re the England manager, you’re normally in a reasonably privileged position. We have given young players their opportunity ahead of their time, which has given us a greater depth.</p>
      <p>“There’s nothing better than seeing the smile on Tammy Abraham’s face when he gets his first goal for England [on Thursday]. That almost makes everything worthwhile.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea fans took to social media before the game, with many believing Hudson-Odoi will indeed get his chance against Kosovo and win his third senior cap.</p>

      <p>Hudson-Odoi was heavily linked with a move to Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich in the summer before agreeing a new five-year contract at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>But the 19-year-old's new deal has not stopped speculation surrounding the Chelsea winger, and he is reportedly on a list of four young targets being monitored by Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane and president Florentino Perez.</p>
      <p>Spanish publication El Desmarque says both Zidane and Perez are admirers of England international Hudson-Odoi and are keeping tabs on the teenager ahead of a potential summer swoop.</p>
