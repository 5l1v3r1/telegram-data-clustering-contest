                            <h3>PR vs TST Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Heinrich Klaasen form Tshwane Spartans is our pick for this docket of our Dream 11. The wicket-keeper is someone who has played out significant knocks across the course of 2019, a bat always capable of not only keeping his intent in check but opening his arms with aplomb at any stage as well.</p>
                            <h3>PR vs TST Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>With Tshwane Spartans seeing both their encounters being abandoned, we have been left devoid and yearning for the batting heavy unit of the side to come out and immerse us in their stupendous brand of cricket. The side is lined up with some stellar names, stunning outstanding bats who are capable of coming out and cleaning any bowling unit in the world. </p>
                            <p>And we are indulging in the same stalwarts for this tie in the form of the duo of AB de Villiers and Dean Elgar and Theunis de Bruyn whilst from the other side we are venturing in with Faf du Plessis who scored 38 runs in a mere 20 balls in the side’s last outing. Opener Henry Davids played a good knock as well in the same match to guide his side to a win to see him be inducted in our setup as well for the day.</p>
                            <h3>PR vs TST Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Thriving in the ICC T20 World Cup Qualifiers, Roelof van der Merwe comes into our side not only due to his escalated batting order but the left hand brand of spin he’ll be doling out as well. On a wicket where the wickets will be extremely tepid to come by, the bowlers spinning away deliveries will make for a travesty to peel off, seeing him become an extremely wily bowler in this one.</p>
                            <p>We have the one player come in from Paarl Rocks as well for the day with Dwaine Pretorius finding a place in our Dream 11 side given his capabilities with the new ball.</p>
                            <h3>PR vs TST Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>With two wickets against Cape Town Blitz, frontline bowler and death overs operator Hardus Viljoen from Paarl Rocks was always going to be hammered down in the framework of our side for the imminent clash. He will be accompanied by spinner Tabraiz Shamsi who has been equally pivotal for the side whilst from the other side we are wrapping up our side with the pick of Lutho Sipamla.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>AB de Villiers will be captaining our side for the day while Faf du Plessis is our vice-captain.</p>
