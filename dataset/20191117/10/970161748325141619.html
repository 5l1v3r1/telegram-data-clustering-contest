      <p>A landlord faces prosecution after plastering a huge <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/iphone/">iPhone</a> advert across his tenants’ windows without warning.</p>
      <p>Up to 19 households are thought to have been deprived of natural sunlight after the banner promoting the latest iPhone was put up across a block of flats in Dalston, east London.</p>
      <p>Residents claim the hoarding was installed three years ago without notice and that their concerns have been repeatedly dismissed.</p>
      <p>Sevineh Nazif, 42, told <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/iphone-ad-block-windows-light-hackney-london-poverty-a9204566.html">The Independent</a>: ‘There’s no sunlight, no view out of the window. When the windows are closed I can’t breathe, I feel claustrophobic.’</p>
      <p>‘We never see the sun, it feels like we’re blocked out from everything. We’ve been abandoned.</p>
      <p>‘The landlord said the company had the right to put what they want up there. They’re not bothered. As long as they’re getting money for the advert they don’t care.’</p>

      <p>Another tenant, Ahmed Mehjoob, 55, added: ‘They just came and put it up. They said this is what we are doing, if you don’t like it you can leave the building. They are getting money from these people. They don’t care about us.’</p>

      <p>‘One day, I tried to cut it with a knife. I made a hole. They called me and said don’t do this again because they are renting to a company. The advertising company called the landlord and complained.’</p>
      <p>‘For us, there is no light, no sun, it is blocking us from the outside. It makes you isolated,’ he said, adding his rent costs £257 per week in housing benefit.</p>
      <p>Alex Armitage, Green Party candidate for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10355661/iphone-ad-building-tenants-living-in-darkness/">Sun Online</a>: ‘When your landlord sells the sunlight coming through your window, you know how brutal modern Britain can be.’</p>
      <p>‘Families are living there in desperate situations. Some are private tenants, others are homeless people housed by the council.</p>

      <p>‘The building is in a state of disrepair, cracked windows, rotting window frames.</p>
      <p>Hackney Council said they are taking action over the poster which they branded ‘illegal’, according to Sun Online.</p>
      <p>It was claimed the owner of the building and the owner of the advert will be prosecuted and have been issued with court summons.</p>
      <p>Twitter users posted pictures of the poster apparently being taken down in the early hours of Sunday morning.</p>
