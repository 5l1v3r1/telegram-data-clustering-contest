      <p>“Yesterday, what we saw were few (legitimate) demonstrators but thugs, bullies and morons,” Castaner told Europe 1 radio when asked about the violence in Paris on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators torched cars and pelted police with stones and bottles and police fired tear gas and water cannon during the rallies to mark a year since the birth of the anti-government yellow vest movement.</p>
      <p>Across France, police arrested 264 people on Saturday, including 173 in Paris, Castaner said.</p>
      <p>Some 28,000 people demonstrated across France on Saturday, including 4,700 in Paris.</p>
      <p>This was more than in recent weeks but less than the record 282,000 estimated for the whole country on Nov. 17, 2018.</p>
      <p>Yellow vest activists were staging protests in France on Sunday though these were largely peaceful.</p>
      <p>In early afternoon around 50 people, some wearing yellow vests, briefly entered the Galeries Lafayette flagship department store on Boulevard Haussman, a tourist hotspot in the centre of Paris.</p>
      <p>The activists were quickly evacuated by staff and police.</p>
      <p>The disruption forced the store to shut down for the rest of the day. A spokeswoman for Galeries Lafayette said the store will open as usual on Monday.</p>
