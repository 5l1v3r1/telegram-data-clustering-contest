      <p>Five days after her baby son had died Rhian Mannings faced a further tragedy - her devastated and grief stricken husband took his own life.</p>
      <p>Shocked and reeling from the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health/unimaginable-heartache-losing-son-husband-16147241">double tragedy</a> , Rhian needed help and support like never before. But nobody came.</p>
      <p>Amidst her darkest hour, the Pontyclun mum set up <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/mothers-day-brings-back-unimaginably-14376114">the charity 2 Wish Upon A Star</a> in 2012 which provides support to bereaved families.</p>
      <p>This week, she took her campaign to the steps of the Senedd before handing over a petition with 5,000 signatures on it.</p>
      <p>Rhian said if bereavement support services had been in place at the hospital immediately after George's death, her husband Paul may still be with her today.</p>

        <figcaption>Rhian Mannings suffered unimaginable heartache when her son George died suddenly just a week after his first birthday and her husband Paul took his own life five days later</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"We walked out into the night with nothing, alone and frightened," she said.</p>
      <p>"Nobody came, nobody reached out to support us and it was left to devastated friends and family to support my husband Paul and I.</p>
      <p>"Five days after we lost our son my surviving two young children and I faced more heartache when Paul took his own life. Once again nobody came."</p>
      <p>"Families require support immediately after such loss. They need to have a point of contact if they have questions and a friendly ear to listen."</p>
      <p>She added: "You never get over the loss of your child and families need to know there is long-term support in place for to help them through the grieving process.</p>
      <p>"There is no planning or preparation prior to a sudden death and the effect of traumatic loss can have a huge impact on the mental health of parents, siblings and other family members.</p>
      <p>"We believe this support is essential and will prevent families walking out into the night with no hope, no support and most importantly without their child."</p>

      <p>2 Wish Upon A Star already works with every health board in Wales and is supported by every police force.</p>
      <p>There are now immediate support pathways in place in every emergency unit and critical care unit.</p>
      <p>It also works with every coroner, mortuary, organ donation team and Wales Air Ambulance to make sure no family is missed.</p>
      <p>However, all of this support is currently funded by donations from the public. 2 Wish Upon a Star receives no public sector funding.</p>
      <p>This support includes counselling, memory boxes and an immediate support pathway. The causes of death include sudden infant death syndrome, accidents, illness and young suicides. More than 520 families have received support since 2015.</p>
      <p>However, many families are missed and Rhian hopes the petition will ensure this never happens in future.</p>
      <p>She added: "Staff have been known to 'forget' to give memory boxes, decided that the family of an 18-year-old does not require support as 'he had stubble' and that the offer of support at time of death is 'not appropriate'.</p>
      <p>"It is not for the health professional involved to decide if a family require support. We know by speaking to staff and families that our service is changing lives for everyone involved in the sudden death of a child or young adult and we want the Welsh Government to ensure all families get the offer of support when needed most."</p>

      <p>Rhian and her colleagues from 2 Wish Upon a Star were joined on the steps of the Senedd by families who have accessed the charity's support.</p>
      <p>One such family is the Roddas from Aberdare who lost their son Owen to an asthma attack last year.</p>
      <p>Owen’s mother Christine said of the petition: "After my son Owen died from an asthma attack in 2018, just knowing that 2 Wish Upon a Star were there to support us gave us so much comfort as there is nothing else out there in our area to help bereaved families.</p>
      <p>"Their ongoing support has been a lifeline to me and my family, and we have found their support group on Facebook particularly helpful.</p>
      <p>"The fact that you can talk to other parents in a safe, closed and monitored group has been invaluable. The whole team at 2 Wish have been amazing and it is good to know that they can support families as long as it is needed, but we just want to make sure that every family in Wales has the chance to receive the help we did."</p>
      <p>The petition which was handed in at the Assembly, calls on the Welsh Government to provide essential bereavement support to families of children aged 25 and under who die suddenly.</p>
      <p>The Assembly's petition committee will now examine the petition and will decide on next steps.</p>
