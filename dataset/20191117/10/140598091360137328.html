      <h1>John Lewis Black Friday deals: the best predictions for the 2019 sale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:18:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-reporters/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>As one of the big dogs of the high street, John Lewis consistently offers <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/black-friday-2019-deals-when-best-sales-start-uk-shops/">Black Friday</a> deals - and we expect nothing less from the 2019 sales.</p>
      <p>Last year, the famous British retailer cut prices on a range of sought-after items, from coffee machines to Mulberry handbags, home speakers to games consoles, as well as two of its most searched-for products - Apple Airpods and the Applewatch Series 3.</p>
      <p>This year, we can expect similar discounts on premium products - but make sure you log-on early if you're shopping online. The store revealed that last year it's busiest Black Friday shopping hours were between 6am and 7am. </p>
      <p>If you're a deal-hunter who likes to shop around for the best discount, John Lewis's Never Knowingly Undersold policy will also be a (financial) benefit this Black Friday, November 29, because it means the store will price match the promotions of its competitors. </p>
      <p>Looking at last year's sales and current market trends, the following are our predictions for the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-black-friday-deals-2019-uk-what-offers-discounts-where/">deals</a> we can expect from John Lewis for Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2019. </p>
      <h3>Best John Lewis Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals 2019</h3>
      <h4>Headphones and speakers</h4>
      <p>Last year we were particularly impressed by the deals on the Bose QuietComfort Noise Cancelling QC20 <b>in-ear headphones.</b> These are still on offer at John Lewis, so we predict further reductions this year.</p>
      <p>Given the increasing popularity in wireless headphones, we expect there will be significant reductions on headphones with cables - such as the Sony MDR-EX650 in-ear headphones.</p>
      <p>Moving with the times, we reckon there could also be slight price cuts on <b>wireless headphones</b> - such as the Bose SoundSport wireless in-ear headphones. John Lewis now stock a range of wireless headphones - from BOSE, Jabra, Beats and more. There could even be a slight reduction in the 2019 Apple Airpods, as the previous model had £15 off last year. </p>

      <p><b>Speakers</b> are also popular on Black Friday. Last year, the Sonos One Voice-Controlled Smart Speaker was in the sales. This year, we predict the second generation of the Sonos One speaker could have its price cut, to compete with the newer (and jazzier) model: the Sonos Move. This speaker similarly uses voice control and connects to Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, but it also works on the move and is fairly weather-resistant. </p>
      <p>As <b>smart speakers</b> continue to have their moment, we predict savings on some of the most popular models. Last year, the Google Home Mini hands-free smart speaker was almost half price (down to £25) and included a YouTube Music Premium membership at no extra cost. This year, we predict the Google Home Mini will again feature in the sales, as it has been slightly upstaged by newer models, such as the Google Home Hub and the Google Home Max. In light of this, the regular Google Home Hands-Free Smart Speaker might also feature in this year's sales. </p>
      <h4>Kitchenware and home appliances</h4>
      <p>It's the crème de la crème of kitchenware, and we predict that <b>Le Creuset</b> products will be in this year's Black Friday sales. Last year, a four-piece set of non-stick cookware pans were on offer, and this year we predict the <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fle-creuset-3-ply-stainless-steel-pan-set-4-pieces%2Fp751524">four-piece Le Creuset 3-Ply Stainless Steel Pan set </a>could well be in the sales too.</p>
      <p>Similarly, we predict savings on the set of four <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fle-creuset-stoneware-side-plates-22cm-set-of-4-assorted%2Fp3729330">Le Creuset Stoneware Side Plates</a> and the <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fle-creuset-signature-cast-iron-round-casserole-ultra-violet%2Fp3961951">Ultra Violet Le Creuset casserole dish</a> (which we rated one of the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/home/best-casserole-dishes-delicious-soups-stews-pot-roasts/">best casserole dishes</a> on the market), as these products are already being offered at a discount. </p>

        <figcaption>Le Creuset casserole dishes have a distinctive look - which is why they're so sought-after </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>KitchenAid</b> is another brand that is usually high on our wish lists, and we expect its iconic <b>stand mixer</b> will be in this year's sales. Last year the KitchenAid 150 Artisan 4.8-litre stand mixer was on offer, and this year we predict a slight reduction in the price of its upgrade: the 175 Artisan 4.8-litre stand mixer, which is currently retailing at £499. </p>
      <p>We also envisage sales on <b>coffee machines</b>, following discounts on the Tassimo Vivy coffee machine by Bosch and the particularly popular Sage SES500BSS Bambino Plus coffee machine last year. We recommend you keep your eye out for deals on The Telegraph's list of the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/equipment/the-best-coffee-machines/">best coffee machines</a> on the market for 2019. </p>
      <p>Black Friday is a good opportunity to invest in bigger products, too. Last year there was a significant discount on the Bosch WAT28371BG freestanding <b>washing machine</b>. This year, we predict the updated version of the machine will be on offer - the WAT28463GB, which has settings for washing different types of clothes, from woolly jumpers to sportswear. </p>
      <p><b>Vacuum cleaners</b> are also generally discounted during Black Friday. Last year, there was a 10 per cent discount on selected Dyson vacuum cleaners. This year, we predict similar savings on Dyson products - especially the slightly older models, such as the V7 and the V8, both of which are cordless. </p>
      <h4>Tech</h4>
      <p>If you're looking for a new phone, laptop or TV, it's worth waiting until Black Friday and Cyber Monday before you make your purchase. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/apple-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-best-predictions-2019/">Apple products </a>could well feature in the John Lewis sales. Last year some of the best-selling electrical products on Black Friday included the <b>Apple iPad</b> mini 4 (which had a £100 discount) and the Apple Watch series 3 (which had a £60 saving). This year, we predict deals on the Apple iPad Pro 11" model from 2018 (as the 2019 model has since upstaged it) and, if it hasn't sold out by then, the 2017 10.5" Apple iPad Pro, which was on offer last year and is currently reduced to clear. </p>
      <p>The<b> iPhone</b> XS and XR both featured in last year's sales - which is surprising, given that they were such new models. With the advent of the iPhone 11 Pro, we predict significant reductions on many former models - including the XR, XS and even the XS Max, and even bigger savings on older models, like the iPhones 8, 7 and 6s Plus. </p>
      <p>The <b>Samsung Galaxy 9 </b>was also in last year's sales, with a significant £170 discount. This year, we think there could be price reductions on the Galaxy 9 model, as well as a slight discount on the Samsung Galaxy 10 (as the Samsung Galaxy 10+ has since stolen the limelight). </p>
      <p>We also predict deals on <b>laptops</b>, following last year's deal on the Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series laptop with Intel Core i5. This year, there could be deals on Dell, Lenovo, HP and other mainstream brands - check out our predictions for the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/predictions-best-laptop-deals-black-friday-cyber-monday-sales/">best laptop deals</a> for 2019 to find out more. </p>
      <p>Similarly, we predict deals on larger products, such as <b>televisions</b>, given the inclusion of the<b> </b>​​Panasonic TX-55FZ802B OLED HDR 4K Ultra HD Smart TV last year. It seems that Ultra HD 4K televisions are here to stay - and we have rounded up our predictions of the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-tv-deals-black-friday-2019-uk-cyber-monday-sales/">best TV deals</a> you can expect to be in this year's sales. </p>
      <p>Lastly, <b>gamers </b>will be pleased to know that the Sony Playstation 4 was included in deals last year - often in a bundle with popular games, such as Red Dead Redemption 2. This year, we advise you keep an eye out for similar <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-gaming-deals-black-friday-2019-sale-nintendo-ps4-xbox-games/">gaming deals</a>.</p>
      <h3>How to shop at John Lewis on Black Friday</h3>
      <p>If you're not brave enough to elbow your way through the crowds in the store itself, don't worry: you can get the same impressive deals by shopping online from the comfort of your bed. </p>
      <p>But it's not quite as easy as it sounds - as systems can time out, and you can lose out on deals if you're not fast enough. Below, therefore, are our top tips for shopping online at John Lewis on Black Friday.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Get online early. </b>Last year, the busiest shopping hour on the website was between 6am and 7am on Black Friday. So you might need to set your alarm a little earlier if you want to find the best deals.</li>
        <li><b>Use your Bookmarks. </b>It's worth scouring the website a few weeks in advance and adding your wish-list products to your Bookmarks (if you create a new folder, this will make your life even easier). Then, on the day, you can quickly find out whether your dream purchases are on sale.</li>
        <li><b>Register as a member. </b>It can be worth registering as a member before Black Friday, as you will get email alerts from the retailer (which could include any deals from that day) and it will speed up your check-out process.</li>
        <li><b>Follow on social media</b>. Be sure to follow John Lewis on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram so you can find out about new deals.</li>
        <li><b>Read The Telegraph's live coverage. </b>We will be publishing our pick of the best Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals as soon as they become available, so be sure to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/">follow our page</a> for live updates. </li>
