      <p>Britain’s first gay dads have split up after 32 years - and one is now dating his daughter’s ex.</p>
      <p>Tony and Barrie Drewitt-Barlow have called time on their romance, reports on Sunday suggest.</p>
      <p>Self-made businessmen Tony and ex Barrie made history in the late 90s when they became the first gay men in the UK to father children through surrogacy.</p>
      <p>Barrie's new partner Scott Hutchison is reportedly daughter Saffron's ex-boyfriend - and they all live together in a £6million house.</p>
      <p>25-year-old Scott and 50-year-old Barrie's relationship has Tony and Saffron's "blessing", <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/britains-first-gay-dads-split-20898892">Mirror Online reports.</a></p>
      <p>55-year-old Tony and Saffron, 19, discovered their romance after a secret nine-month courtship.</p>

      <p>Scott, 25, announced it was "time for the world to know" about his relationship with Barrie.</p>
      <p>Barrie also broke his silence and insisted to  <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10361253/first-gay-dads-split-daughter-boyfriend/">The Sun</a>  he was "not having a mid-life crisis" and despite the age gap between him and Scott it 'felt right'.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’ve fallen in love with Scott and he has done the same. I feel stupid at my age to have these feelings about someone other than Tony and half my age.</p>

      <p>"But when you know something is right, it’s right. We have not made definite plans but I would like to marry Scott.</p>
      <p>“I’m not having a mid-life crisis - if I was having one I’d buy myself a Porsche 911. This is the real deal."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Scott, who has been Barrie’s PA for seven years, became “a shoulder to cry on” after Tony was diagnosed with throat cancer of which he is now in remission for.</p>
      <p>It also comes almost two years after Saffron said she  planned  to have her own twins via surrogate with Scott, who made no secret of being bisexual and said their relationship was never sexual.</p>

      <p>Barrie and Tony's twins, Saffron and brother Aspen, are the first children to be registered as having two fathers and no mother.</p>
      <p>The couple also have son Orlando, 16, and twin boys Jasper and Dallas, nine.</p>
      <p>They grew up on Manchester council estates, but now have a combined wealth of around £40 million and spread their time between a £6million water-front Florida property and a sprawling Essex mansion.</p>
