          <p>Liverpool are the reigning European Champions and Premier League leaders. Under Jurgen Klopp, the Reds have become one of the most dominant force in football right now. However, that was not always the case.</p>

                      <h4>Worst</h4>
                      <h3>#5) Paul Konchesky (2010)</h3>

                      <p>Paul Konchesky is the face of Liverpool’s worst period in the Premier League era. Having played under Roy Hodgson at Fulham, the then Liverpool boss brought him to the Anfield for a baffling fee of around £5 million.</p>

                        <anchor name="div-gpt-ad-ATD-TS-RES7">
                          <p>He was made the first choice left-back under Hodgson and had replaced the promising Emiliano Insua, who was loaned and eventually sold. However, with every passing game, it became evident that Konchesky was the worst player of an exceptionally poor side.</p>
                          <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148">
                            <p>That somebody like Paul Konchesky played for the Reds just under a decade back shows just how far they’ve come. However, despite being arguably the worst player on this list, his price tag and the little expectations off him keep him quite low on this list.</p>
                            <h4>Best</h4>
                            <h3>#5) Alisson (2018)</h3>
                            <figure>
                              <img src="https://i2.wp.com/thesportsrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/thumb_89353_default_news_size_5.jpeg?w=850&amp;ssl=1"/>
                            </figure>
                            <p>Liverpool purchased Alisson from Roma in the summer of 2018 for a fee of £67m. This made him the most expensive keeper at the time, the record though was broken just a few weeks later with Chelsea’s purchase of Kepa. Alisson has since proved to be worth the price and has become an integral member of the Europe Conquering Liverpool side.</p>
                            <p>He began his life in the Premier League with 3 consecutive clean sheets. With him between the sticks, Liverpool embarked on a 20-game unbeaten streak in the league. At the end of the season, Alisson had 21 clean sheets to his name, the most by any Premier League goalkeeper on his debut season.</p>
                            <p>He was also awarded the Golden Glove for his performances. His consistent performance, concentration, positional sense and ability to read the game has led to many calling him the best goalkeeper in the world. The claim finds its merit in the fact that he was named The Best FIFA Goalkeeper earlier this year.</p>
