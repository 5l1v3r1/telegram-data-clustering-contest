      <h1>General Election: Tories accused of 'pandering to Farage' on immigration policy</h1>
      <h2>The party has appeared confused after senior figures - including Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel appeared to differ on whether reducing migration was a firm commitment</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:00:57+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>The Tories have been accused of “pandering to Nigel Farage” with their immigration policy.</p>
      <p>It comes after days of confusion over the party’s approach to migration after senior figures appeared to disagree on policy.</p>
      <p>Home Secretary Priti Patel last night pledged to cut immigration “overall”.</p>
      <p>Just days before <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> appeared to row back on the promise, saying it “may” fall “in some sectors.”</p>
      <p>And today Security Minister Brandon Lewis, a former immigration minister, confirmed the party’s policy is to “bring immigration down” - but he said the Tories would not “set arbitrary targets”.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> ’s Jonathan Ashworth said: “Every single <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> the Tory immigration minister gets wheeled out to say this.</p>
      <p>“Have they ever delivered it? Have they heck. I mean, do you believe him? I don’t.”</p>
      <p>But he wouldn’t say whether Labour wanted migration to go up or down, adding they want a “balanced, fair approach” rather than “arbitrary targets.”</p>
      <p>And Lib Dem Home Affairs spokeswoman Christine Jardine accused the party of pandering to Nigel Farage with their immigration position.</p>
      <p>She said: “Pledging to cut immigration is just more evidence that the Tories are pandering to the likes of Farage in their lurch to the far right. </p>
      <p>“Equally the Labour Party continue to fail to be any sort of form of opposition, with Jonathan Ashworth refusing to say what Labour's immigration policy is.”</p>
