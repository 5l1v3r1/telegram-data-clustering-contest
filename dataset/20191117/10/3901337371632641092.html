      <h1>‘It Was The Same For Karim Benzema’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:27:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:27</time> by <a rel="author">Soccer Laduma</a></address>
      <p>It took Lebo Mothiba 10 league games before he could open his scoring account for his French club RC Strasburg this season, but the Bafana Bafana man reckons he may finally be over his slump in form.</p>
      <p>Mothiba has now added two more goals to his tally in his last three Ligue 1 games, a moral booster the national team could use as they face Sudan in another 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier this afternoon.</p>

      <p>“I looked also and it was the same for Karim Benzema at Real Madrid. He played 30-something games and he scored like four goals, so this happens as a striker,” said Mothiba, who was a late substitute in Bafana’s 2-0 defeat away to Ghana in their opening qualifier in Group C on Thursday night in Cape Coast.</p>
      <p>“My coach and everyone spoke to me to say I did not have a lot of holidays (Bafana were at the Afcon in June and July) and I have to take it slowly and when the time comes I would start playing. But I said I wanted to play, but they know my body and know I had to recover. That’s how they did it and I was playing in the second half, but now I am getting full games,” the 23-year-old forward explained.</p>
      <p>He’s hoping for a change of fortune for Bafana against Sudan at Orlando Stadium as coach Molefi Ntseki looks for his first win.</p>
      <p>“A lot of things haven’t changed that much because he (Molefi) worked with coach Baxter and they were always together. Some of the things we do, he used to do with Baxter. I think the guys are also happy with the sessions,” he said.</p>
