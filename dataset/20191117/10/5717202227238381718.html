      <p>Aston Villa pair Jack Grealish and John McGinn feature on Manchester United’s January wishlist.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/manchester-united/story/3990703/sources-manchester-united-to-make-enquiry-over-haaland-availability-in-january">According to ESPN</a>, Man United want to sign a number of players in January. Alongside the likes of Erling Braut Haaland and James Maddison, Villa duo Grealish and McGinn are also targets.</p>
      <p>Man United are looking at potential reinforcements and midfield. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admires Grealish and McGinn so that could be a potential route in January.</p>

      <p>Aston Villa will be desperate to hold onto their two midfield stars. Dean Smith uses them in his starting line-up and both midfielders are integral to his plans.</p>
      <p>McGinn joined Villa from Hibernian in summer 2018 and he is a hit in the West Midlands. The left-footed Scotsman’s energy, commitment and ability to create goalscoring opportunities has earned him a place as a cult hero at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Grealish is the fan favourite. The local lad has come through the ranks and Villa and he is a boyhood fan. Grealish is now the skipper and his performance levels have invited talk of an England call-up.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view</h3>
      <p>Man United have long admired McGinn. But after rewarding him with a new contract last year, Aston Villa are under no pressure to sell their prize assets.</p>
      <p>Grealish is the hero at Villa and he needs to stay. Under his leadership, Aston Villa are reaching new heights. The midfield star loves being the protagonist in the new era.</p>
