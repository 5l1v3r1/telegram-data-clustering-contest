        <b>THE heartbroken mum of a little girl who died after catching a bug at Glasgow's superhospital has demanded NHS chiefs stop "bullying" the whistleblower who exposed the "cover up".</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kimberly Darroch, 35, claims her daughter Milly Main, 10, c<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4959465/mum-daughter-killed-glasgow-hospital-dirty-water-health-truth/">ontracted a fatal infection while in remission from leukaemia the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.</a></p>

      <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde have said that they were not obliged to test for bloodstream infection Stenotrophomonas - listed as a possible cause on the child's death certificate - at the time of Milly's death and could therefore not determine whether the infection was linked to their water supply.</p>
      <p>But Milly's mother, from Lanark, has said she is "100 per cent" certain contaminated water caused the infection and told the BBC she feels "let down" and "lied to" in the wake of her daughter's death.</p>
      <p>Now, grieving Kimberly has called on the health board to show genuine remorse" for the scandal.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/super-hospital-chiefs-bullying-whistleblower-20896930">Sunday Mail</a>, she said: “I want to thank the whistleblower for coming forward and hope to meet them face-to-face one day to say thank you in person.</p>
      <p>“The bullying and intimidation from the health board has to stop and they need to show genuine remorse rather than the insulting statements they have been putting out.”</p>
      <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde earlier said they "remain very concerned" that a member of staff has made a claim of a link when "there is no evidence of this".</p>

      <p>But Scottish Labour MSP Anas Sarwar has demanded the health board be put into "special measures".</p>
      <p>He also accused hospital chiefs of "threatening and intimidating" the whistleblower who claimed that Milly's death was caused by contaminated water in 2017.</p>
      <p>It comes after the anonymous member of staff approached Mr Sarwar with the details.</p>
      <p>Describing NHSGGC as "not fit for purpose", Mr Sarwar said: "The Glasgow health board has unforgivably let down patients and staff.</p>
      <p>"There was an attempted cover-up of Milly's death, and there are still dozens of families who don't know the truth about infections contracted in the QUEH.</p>

      <p>"This only came to light following the brave actions of an NHS whistleblower.</p>
      <p>"But rather than seek answers for patients and the public, the health board has resorted to attacking the whistleblower, threatening and intimidating them.</p>
      <p>"This is a clear attempt to silence staff from speaking out, and prevent the truth being heard by the public."</p>
      <p>He added: "The Scottish Government must now step in and put the health board into special measures, so that ministers take control, staff can speak out in confidence they will not lose their jobs, and - most importantly - parents can learn the truth.</p>

      <p>"NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is not fit for purpose."</p>
      <p>The cover up allegations have led to calls for Health Secretary Jeane Freeman to resign.</p>
      <p>But Ms Freeman said: "I am at all times aware of the importance of patient confidentiality and so rightly, I believe, I did not treat this correspondence as a public matter.</p>
      <p>"The ward in which the child concerned in the correspondence I received on 20 September, 2A/2B, was closed and undergoing remedial and upgrading work.</p>
      <p>"Any suggestion that children were at risk after I received this information is therefore incorrect."</p>
      <p>An NHSGGC spokeswoman said: “We are sorry for any distress and anxiety being caused to families at this time.</p>
      <p>“The sole purpose of our communications is to tell the facts. The truth is there is no way to know whether Milly’s infection was linked to the water supply as we did not consider this to be the source at the time and we did not test for the particular infection in the water supply.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“A potential link between infections and the water supply only emerged the following year and this was confirmed earlier this year when Health Protection Scotland published their report on their investigations. We acted on this report and put in place extensive measures to improve the water supply, which is safe.</p>
      <p>“We are absolutely committed to providing patients and families with information and ensuring they get answers to the questions they have; it is really important that we base these answers on the facts.</p>
      <p>"We are working with Professor Craig White who has been appointed by the Cabinet Secretary to provide support for families.</p>
      <p>“We always have to take care when discussing our patients not to breach their rights to confidentiality. This can make it difficult to discuss in detail individual cases but we wish to make clear that we are taking these matters extremely seriously.”</p>
