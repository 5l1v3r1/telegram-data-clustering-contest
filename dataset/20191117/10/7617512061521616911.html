      <p>Northbound traffic on the Trans-Canada Highway is moving again following a rockslide south of Goldstream Provincial Park on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>A slide blocked the lane near the entrance to Ice Cream Mountain at about 10 a.m. Flaggers were sent to the scene to direct single-lane alternating traffic from Finlayson Arm Road to Westshore Parkway.</p>
      <p>Emcon Services, the road and bridge contractor for southern Vancouver Island, said a loader and dump trucks are clearing the lane.</p>
