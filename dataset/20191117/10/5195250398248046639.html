      <h3>Expect the upcoming scooter to take some of its styling inspiration from the Burgman scooters sold internationally</h3>
      <p>Suzuki has shifted its entire focus from investing in a new manufacturing plant towards adding a new product to their current lineup in an effort to attract more buyers. Suzuki has plans to introduce new premium models in its lineup. The Japanese two-wheeler manufacturer will likely introduce a bigger and more powerful Burgman street scooter alongside a 250cc Adventure tourer in the country soon.</p>
      <p>The Suzuki officials quite clearly stated that they are planning to add more premium scooters to their lineup which will likely include a 150cc scooter or maybe something with higher displacement. Suzuki’s current range of scooters includes – the popular Access 125 and the Burgman Street 125.</p>
      <p>Suzuki is still working on their upcoming 150cc scooter which will likely be based on the Burgman Street. We believe that upcoming Burgman Street 150 will comparatively be a more practical scooter for the Indian customers keeping in mind its size and features it will offer.</p>

      <p>The Burgman Street 125 which is currently available in India is popular because of its premium styling and exclusive features. The Burgman Street 125 is powered by the same 124cc, 4-Stroke, single-cylinder, air-cooled, SOHC, 2 Valve engine that powers the Access 125. The unit produces the same 8.7 ps of peak power and 10.2 Nm of peak torque.</p>
      <p>Recently, a patent image Haojue Holdings (Suzuki’s partner in the Chinese market) upcoming scooter codenamed, HJ150T-28 was leaked online. The scooter seemed to have taken some of its styling inspiration from the bigger and more powerful Burgman maxi scooters available for sale in the International market.</p>

      <p>As the name hints, the scooter will likely be powered by a 150cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled engine. The unit will likely produce around 9.5 ps of peak power and 10.5 Nm of peak torque.</p>
      <p>Although it’s too early to talk about the features, however, expect the upcoming 150cc premium scooter to feature a full LED headlamp, LED taillamp, a fully digital LCD instrument cluster, big and wide seat step up for the comfort of rider and pillion, and practical storage space under the seat.</p>
