      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:42:51+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:42</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Rugby star Israel Folau has claimed gay marriage and abortion are responsible for the bush fire crisis in Australia.</p>
      <p>Folau, 30, was filmed delivering a sermon at the Church of Jesus Christ in Kenthurst on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The devout Christian has previously had his Rugby Australia contract ripped up for homophobic posts on social media.</p>
      <p>Speaking in the footage, that was posted to The Truth of Jesus Christ Church's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page, Folau said: "They've legalised same-sex marriage... Going against the laws that God says.</p>
      <p>"Abortion – it's OK now to murder and kill infants, unborn children - and they deem that to be OK. </p>
      <p>"Look how rapid these bush fires, these droughts, all these things they've come in a short period of time – you think it's a coincidence?"</p>

      <p>Ex-Wallabies star Folau, who has previously criticised transgender children during his sermons, suggested God was punishing Australia for the legalisation.</p>
      <p>"What you see out there in the world – it's only a little taste of what God's judgement is like. The news is saying these bushfires are the worst we’ve ever seen in Australia – they haven't seen anything," he added.</p>
      <p>"God is speaking to us. Speaking to you to repent and to turn away from this."</p>

      <p>Folau is suing Rugby Australia for unlawfully terminating his contract because of his religious beliefs and is seeking £5.3m ($10m) in damages.</p>
      <p>He most recently played for New South Wales Warratahs in Super Rugby.</p>
      <p>Folau was also stood down from the club side after the homophobic social media post, where he stated those in same sex relationships would go to hell "unless they repent their sins".</p>
