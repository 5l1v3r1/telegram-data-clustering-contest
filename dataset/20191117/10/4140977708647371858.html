          <p>During the 18th match of the ongoing Marsh Cup between South Australia and Western Australia in Adelaide, Western Australia all-rounder Ashton Agar received a horrific blow which left him blood-soaked on the ground.</p>
          <p>It all happened on the third delivery of the 41st over when Agar’s younger brother Wes Agar hit a Marcus Stoinis delivery toward Ashton Agar at mid-on. In what was an easy catch, Ashton Agar slipping saw him getting hit in the face.</p>

                <p>With the ball hitting the sunglasses placed on his cap, it was the glass which started the blood flow. It was Western Australia pacer Jhye Richardson who immediately called for medical attention for Ashton. The 26-year old cricketer was witnessed with blood over his face and jersey and eventually left the ground on the back of applause from the audiences.</p>
                <p>Wes Agar, who registered career-best bowling figures of 10-1-40-5 in the first innings, couldn’t make the most of the reprieve as he was dismissed in the following over after scoring 9 (11). It was an exceptional 13th List A century from Callum Ferguson which saw the hosts nearly chasing a 253-run target.</p>

                      <p>Before becoming the last batsman to get out as South Australia were bundled out for 246 in 49 overs, Ferguson scored 127 (125) with the help of nine fours and four sixes. With bowling figures of 10-1-48-5, Western Australia fast bowler Nathan Coulter-Nile was the pick of their bowlers.</p>
                      <p>After South Australia captain Jake Lehmann won the toss and put the visitors in to bat, Western Australia scored 252/10 in 49.1 overs as Cameron Green top-scored for them with 86 (78) with the help of six fours and three sixes.</p>
