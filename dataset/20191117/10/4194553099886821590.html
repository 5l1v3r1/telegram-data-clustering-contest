      <p>Senegalese artist Boubou, known for going viral when some videos of him painting celebrities hit the internet by storm, has now tried his hand with Sadio Mane.</p>
      <p>As an extra twist, as if this skill wasn’t already hard enough to pull off, Boubou decided to use a football as a makeshift paint brush.</p>
      <p>He even does this upside down – I mean, he’s not upside down, but he paints Mane the wrong way around. It’s an incredible watch.</p>
