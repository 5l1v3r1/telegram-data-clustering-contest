      <p>HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) — The NASCAR Cup Series championship will be decided at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Joe Gibbs Racing drivers Kyle Busch, Denny Hamlin and Martin Truex Jr. are racing for the title Sunday along with Stewart-Haas Racing star Kevin Harvick.</p>
      <p>Busch, Harvick and Truex are all going for a second Cup championship. Hamlin is looking for his first.</p>
      <p>Las Vegas oddsmakers have basically posted the winner-take-all race as a dead heat with no clear favorite.</p>
      <p>This championship field is nearly identical to last year, with Busch, Harvick and Truex returning to the finale again. Hamlin has not been in the championship race since 2014.</p>
      <p>Homestead is moving on the 2020 schedule to March, ending its streak of 18 years as the season finale.</p>
