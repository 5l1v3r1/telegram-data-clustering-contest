      <p>A fraudster raked in £75,000 after she illegally sold a house without the real owner knowing, a court heard.</p>
      <p>Sarah Broadbelt's carefully planned deception saw her change her name by deed poll and take out a passport under her victim's identity to dupe authorities, reports <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/woman-house-stolen-after-fraudster-17227665">BirminghamLive</a> .</p>
      <p>The victim, Marion Patterson, only became aware of the crime when she went to sell the property but was told it had changed hands four months previously.</p>
      <p>Broadbelt, 32, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, has been jailed for 20 months, having previously admitted charges of fraud and possessing a false identity document.</p>
      <p>Jane Sarginson, prosecuting, told Birmingham Crown Court it was a "brazen and calculated" fraud that "struck at the heart of the conveyancing system".</p>

      <p>Passing sentence, Judge Michael Chambers QC told her: "You played a prominent role in a sophisticated fraud to deprive the owner of the house of its ownership."</p>
      <p>The court heard the real Marion had the house in Quinton, Northamptonshire, valued at up to £200,000, having rented out the home she had owned since 1993 after moving to Cornwall to get married.</p>
      <p>She was warned by Birmingham City Council that it was allegedly being used for benefit fraud by tenants, but still decided to put it on the market, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Ms Sarginson said: "On February 22, 2016 an estate agent rang up and told her her house had been stolen."</p>
      <p>She said it had been sold to a buyer in October 2015 for £75,000.</p>
      <p>The fraud was carried out after Broadbelt changed her name by deed to Marion Patterson and obtained a passport in the owner's name.</p>
      <p>A few days later she obtained a second passport to distance herself from the name change.</p>

      <p>The false document was then used by her to open two accounts with Halifax and one with Barclays.</p>
      <p>Miss Sarginson said Broadbelt also went to a firm of solicitors so the sale could be carried out.</p>
      <p>The firm noted that, according to the documentation, she bought the property when she was six but she managed to persuade them there was a trust in place.</p>
      <p>The proceeds were sent to the accounts that had been opened and were withdrawn in large sums over the course of five to six days.</p>
      <p>Miss Sarginson said, since the fraud had been uncovered, the property had been restored to its owner while the person who bought it had been reimbursed.</p>
      <p>Antonie Muller, defending, said: "This was someone else's device but she did actively participate.</p>
      <p>"They needed a lady because of the name on the deed and she played the actress."</p>
