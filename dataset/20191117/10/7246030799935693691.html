      <h1>Sanders Would Pick AOC as Running Mate But She’s Not Old Enough</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:26:21+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/di/" target="_blank">David Israel</a></address>
      <p>Bernie Sanders appears to be setting up the stage for a joint ticket with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), whom he’s already said was going to play a “very, very important role” in his White House should he be elected president of the United States in 2020.</p>
      <p>A week ago, ABC News asked Sanders directly if he planned to pick Ocasio-Cortez as his running mate, if she were old enough to run. Thank God and the Framers of the Constitution, one must be at least 35 years of age to be elected president or vice president. AOC was born in 1989 – pheew…</p>
      <p>Still, there’s no doubt that the revolutionary Democrat from the Bronx is going to hold a major post in a Sanders administration, and be groomed for higher office in a dystopic future in which the United States has gone socialist.</p>
      <p>“If I’m in the White House, she will play a very, very important role. No question. One way or another, absolutely,” Sanders declared.</p>
      <p>AOC, who graduated cum laude from Boston University College of Arts and Sciences with a BA in 2011, worked as an organizer for the Sanders campaign in 2016.</p>
      <p>“Look, I’ve said this before, let me say it again and I don’t want you to hear this because your head will explode,” Sanders told ABC, his head turned at AOC, “I don’t know of any person… who in the course of less than one year… has had more of an impact on American politics as a freshman member of Congress than she has.”</p>
      <p>“It’s not only that she has focus on the real issues impacting the American people, like climate change, the usury rates that Wall Street are charging working people in this country, but she has been an inspiration… to working people all across this country and to young people in particular,” Sanders said.</p>

      <p>AOC is one of the two congressional representatives of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) – the other one is Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich). The DSA is not only the largest socialist organization by far in the United States in the 21st century, it is also the largest socialist organization in the United States in more than 100 years. As of 2018, DSA membership has soared to 50,000, boasting a 180 local chapters across America, primarily due to youth reaction to President Donald. In fact, between 2013 and 2017, the median age of DSA membership went down to 33 from 68. In the 2017 election, fifteen DSA-affiliated candidates were elected to office in thirteen states, adding to the twenty members already holding elected office nationwide. In November 2018, AOC and Tlaib became the first DSA Congress members, while eleven others were elected to state legislatures.</p>
      <p>In May 2018, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the IDF’s use of deadly force against Arab rioters who stormed the Gaza Strip border fence. She called it a “massacre.” In a July 2018 interview on PBS, she said she was “a proponent of a two-state solution” and condemned Israel’s “occupation of Palestine.” In July 2019, Ocasio-Cortez voted against a House resolution opposing the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel. Spoiler alert: the anti-BDS resolution passed by 398-17.</p>
