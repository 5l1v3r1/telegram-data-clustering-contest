      <p>The 31-year-old - who battles crippling anxiety - recently claimed he isn't taken seriously in the industry because he's an X Factor winner.</p>

      <p>The singer today revealed his staff will take over his Twitter account moving forward.</p>
      <p>He wrote this morning: "Have to be honest some of the things I read on here go a bit toot far and quite frankly f***in hurt, if that was your goal you win Maybe I should have thicker skin at this point I don’t know but either way this is my last tweet, I’m loggin off. Peace out Twitter friends.</p>
      <p>"All posts will be done by digital team moving forward. Thanks for all the love and support shown by fans on this platform over the years it’s been emotional but I’ve gotta delete this app. Much love and respect JA."</p>
      <p>James deleted the app soon after revealing a teaser to his new video Quite Miss Home.</p>

      <p>It was a surprise to fans who have been sending him supportive messages in the wake of his statement.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old spoke out about the pressures of his industry as he claimed the likes of Lewis Capaldi, James Bay and Rag'n'Bone Man are taken more seriously than him.</p>
      <p>He told The Sun: “I don’t know whether the music industry really wants an X Factor winner to reach the kind of heights I have.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of guys that come up and have a lot of success very quickly and get a lot of accolades, that are doing a pretty similar thing to what I’m doing.</p>
      <p>“I’d be lying if I said that didn’t hurt sometimes ’cause I’m still here and I feel like the quality of what I’m doing is above a lot of these guys who get so much praise.”</p>
      <p>James won The X Factor in 2012. Last month he released his highly anticipated third album You.</p>
