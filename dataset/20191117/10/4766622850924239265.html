      <h1>Keto diet - Keto diet plan tips - the immune system's response to influenza</h1>
      <h2>According to the study published in the journal Science Immunology, ketogenic diet, which includes meat, fish, poultry and non-starchy vegetables, may help combat the flu virus.</h2>

      <p>This diet regimen activates a subset of T cells in the lungs not previously associated with the immune system’s response to influenza, <a href="https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/whats-in-a-cough-syrup-64102/">enhancing mucus production f</a>rom airway cells that can effectively trap the virus, said the study published in the journal Science Immunology.</p>
      <p>“This was a totally unexpected finding,” said co-senior author Akiko Iwasaki, Professor at Yale University in the US.</p>
      <p>The researchers found that mice fed a ketogenic diet were better able to <a href="https://www.thehealthsite.com/fitness/weight-loss-tip-120-add-calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplements-to-your-diet-to-reduce-body-fat-v0216-369510/">combat the flu virus</a> than mice fed food high in carbohydrates.</p>
      <p>Specifically, the researchers found that the ketogenic diet triggered the release of gamma delta T cells, immune system cells that produce mucus in the cell linings of the lung — while the high-carbohydrate diet did not.</p>
      <p>When mice were bred without the gene that codes for gamma delta T cells, the ketogenic diet provided no protection against the influenza virus.</p>
      <p>“This study shows that the way the body burns fat to produce ketone bodies from the food we eat can fuel the immune system to fight flu infection,” said co-senior author Visha Deep Dixit, Professor at Yale University.</p>
