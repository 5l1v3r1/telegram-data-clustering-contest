      <p>The owner of Almería, the Saudi Arabian Sheikh Turki Al-Sheikh, continues to strengthen his relationship with Barcelona and Argentina star Lionel Messi. He invited the forward to his residence in Riyadh this weekend to watch Almeria's game against Elche.</p>
      <p>Al-Sheikh and Messi met for the first time this week as Argentine played Brazil in Saudi Arabia. He expressed his desire to sign the Barça man "within five years" in a cordial atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Messi accepted the invitation to go to the Sheikh's house to watch the game, along with international teammates like Dybala, De Paul, Agüero and former Real Betis man Lo Celso. They enjoyed Al-Sheikh's hospitality as they watched the Spanish second division game, which ended 1-1.</p>
      <p>The draw did not satisfy Al-Sheikh, although Messi calmed him down by pointing that there is still a long way to go in the season. Almeria, coached by former Real Madrid player Guti, have won just one of their last 10 games, but remain third in the race for promotion to La Liga.</p>
      <p>Al-Sheikh is a big user of social media and posted a photograph of Messi and his Argentina teammates watching the game at his property in the Saudi Arabian capital.</p>
      <p>Argentina beat Brazil 1-0 on Thursday and have another game on Monday in Tel Aviv (Israel) against Luis Suarez's Uruguay side.</p>
