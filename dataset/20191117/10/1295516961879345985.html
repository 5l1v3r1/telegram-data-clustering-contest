      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/disney-plus/">Disney+</a> has been out for less than a week, and it is already being hacked.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/">ZDNet</a>, hackers started breaking into customers' accounts hours after the service launched. After logging in, they removed all the original user's devices and changed the password and username, giving themselves complete control over the account.</p>

      <p>The accounts were then placed up for sale online. Some were priced as low as $3, while others went as high as $11 (the service itself costs $6.99 a month). Disney  has made no public statement on the matter.</p>

      <p>The hack is the latest in a series of missteps for the streaming service as it concludes its first week of service. On day one, the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/disney-plagued-with-problems-following-early-morning-launch/">service experienced over 7,000 technical issues</a>, with many customers being unable to access their accounts for multiple hours. It was later revealed that service is not available on Vizio TVs, and that Vizio customers would have to wait until 2020 to access the service. Finally, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/disney-streams-x-men-animated-series-out-of-order/">the service streams the animated <i>X-Men </i>series out of order. </a></p>
      <p>Despite the bad news, the service still <a href="https://www.cbr.com/disney-plus-2019-signup-goal-first-day/">beat its 2019 signup goal on day one</a>. The House of Mouse aimed for 8 million by the end of the year and ended up with 10 million by the end of the day.</p>
