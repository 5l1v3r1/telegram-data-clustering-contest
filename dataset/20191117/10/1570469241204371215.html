      <p>A police officer was struck in the leg by an arrow shot by a Hong Kong protester on Sunday, an AFP report said quoting city's force.</p>
      <p>Graphic images showed the arrow embedded in the calf of the police officer, who was working at the scene of fierce clashes at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University on the force's media liaison team.</p>
      <p>The incident took place during a standoff between anti-government protesters and Hong Kong police around a barricaded university.</p>
      <p>Activists hurled petrol bombs, some by catapult, and shot arrows with bows at police who fired tear gas and water cannon in response in the standoff at the Polytechnic University in Kowloon.</p>
      <p>Clashes between protesters and police have become increasingly violent in the Chinese-ruled city, which is grappling with its biggest political crisis in decades.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations pose the gravest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.</p>
      <p>Xi has said he is confident the Hong Kong government can resolve the crisis. Until Saturday, Chinese troops in the city had remained inside their base during the protests.</p>
