      <h1>Report: Bielsa holds extensive talks with Leeds star Tyler Roberts</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7693511/Marcelo-Bielsa-set-entrust-Tyler-Roberts-number-ten-role-Leeds.html">According to a report from the Daily Mail</a>, Marcelo Bielsa has held extensive talks with Tyler Roberts this past week with the youngster set to be given a run as Leeds United’s number 10.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Roberts has worked his way back into the team this season. The 20-year-old has played the full 90 minutes of the Whites’ last two games, scoring the opener in the win over Queens Park Rangers.</p>

      <p>And it appears that playing a prominent role is something that Roberts will have to get used to again.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7693511/Marcelo-Bielsa-set-entrust-Tyler-Roberts-number-ten-role-Leeds.html">The Mail reports</a> that Bielsa has been impressed with the impact that the £4 million Wales international has made and has spoken to him at length in recent days about being the side’s number 10.</p>

      <h3>TBR View – Bielsa’s faith is a big statement</h3>
      <p>It says a lot that Bielsa has reportedly spent so much time working with Roberts in the last few days. The forward is currently away with his national team, so it is telling that Bielsa is still looking to work so closely with him.</p>
      <p>It is a hugely important role in Leeds’s system. It is no secret that the Whites have not scored enough goals so far this season. The two games before the international break saw Leeds bag more than one goal in two consecutive league fixtures for the first time this season. So it is essential that the number 10 is producing game-changing moments.</p>
      <p>And with players such as Pablo Hernandez waiting to come back into the team, it is a big statement that Bielsa feels that Roberts is the man ready to hold down that position.</p>
      <p>Judging by his form in the latter stages of last season, as well as the impact he has recently made, it would be no surprise if putting faith in Roberts proves to be another masterstroke from Bielsa.</p>
