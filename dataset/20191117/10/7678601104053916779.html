      <h1>Hyatt Hotels to reduce single-use plastic by 2021</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:05:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:05</time> by <a rel="author">The Jakarta Post</a></address>
      <p>Following the lead of major hotel chains like <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2019/08/29/marriott-hotels-ditching-small-plastic-toiletry-bottles.html">Marriott</a> and <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2019/08/01/hg-to-ban-sample-size-products-from-its-hotels-in-an-effort-to-fight-plastic.html">InterContinental Hotels Group</a>, Hyatt Hotels has become the latest group to announce plans to reduce single-use plastics within the chain. </p>
      <p>Hyatt, which owns brands like Park Hyatt, Andaz, Hyatt Regency, Thompson Hotels and The Unbound Collection, has pledged to reduce single-use plastic water bottles by June 2021 throughout its properties around the world. </p>
      <p>Other initiatives to reduce their plastic consumption include transitioning to large-format bathroom amenities that will replace travel-size toiletries like shampoo, shower gel, conditioner and lotion; adding more water fountains so guests can refill their reusable water bottles; and serving tap water in carafes and offering bottled water upon request. </p>
      <p>This past summer, Marriott International announced plans to phase out mini shampoo bottles by next December, while IHG also pledged to eliminate single-use plastic toiletries by 2021. </p>
      <p>The move away from plastic has also been adopted by major cruise lines including Royal Caribbean, Norwegian and Carnival.</p>
