      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/harry-styles">Harry Styles</a> has released his latest single, ‘Watermelon Sugar’, after debuting the track on <i>Saturday Night Live </i>last night (November 16).</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/one-direction">One Direction</a> singer was on both hosting and performance duties on the late-night US show, during which he made several jokes at his own expense and a few teasing comments about his former bandmates.</p>
      <p>‘Watermelon Sugar’ is the second track to be taken from Styles’ forthcoming second solo album, <i>Fine Line, </i>which is due December 13. Listen to the new song below.</p>

      <p>During a piano-led monologue, Styles offered up a few quips about the other members of One Direction. “I love those guys. They’re my brothers. Niall, Liam, Louis,” he said, pausing for comic effect. “And, uh, Ringo. Yeah that’s it.” He also joked that he was “so grateful Simon Cowell grew us in those test tubes”. Watch the full clip from last night’s show below.</p>

      <p>The new song follows ‘Lights Up’, the first single to be lifted from the forthcoming album. In a <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/track/harry-styles-lights-up-track-review-second-album-single">four-star review of the track</a>, <i>NME</i> said: “‘Lights Up’ handles the sheer excess of ‘Harry Styles’ with a lighter touch. It’s an intriguing taster of things to come.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this week (November 13), Styles announced details of <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/harry-styles-announces-details-2020-world-tour-2567556">an extensive 2020 world tour called ‘Love On Tour’</a>. Full details of all the UK and Ireland dates are listed below.</p>
