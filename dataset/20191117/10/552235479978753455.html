      <h2>Kristina Aburrow was crossing a road in the Granite City when a Rottweiler left her with both physical and mental scaring in an unprovoked attack.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:04:08+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:04</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Morrow, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/daniel-morrow/</a></address>
      <p>A Scots woman feared that her arm would be ripped off in a terrifying Rottweiler attack.</p>
      <p>Kristina Aburrow was crossing Great Southern Road, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> , when she was mauled by the dog.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old was rushed to hospital after suffering a four-inch gash after the animal clamped its teeth into her left forearm.</p>
      <p>She was able to make a physical recovery inside <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-royal-infirmary">Aberdeen Royal Infirmary</a> , however the mental scars remained for months after the ordeal.</p>

      <p>Kristina, who runs art classes for children, revealed that the kids she teaches are also terrified of the scar that has been left with.</p>
      <p>She says that she was unable to cycle, hike, or even do simple tasks like dress herself or prepare food as she lived with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/mental-health">PTSD</a> following the attack.</p>
      <p>“I can’t describe the panic and fear of seeing this giant animal tear at you”, Kristina said.</p>
      <p>“The teeth. The snarling. It was terrifying. I genuinely thought it would rip my arm off.</p>
      <p>“Now whenever I walk past big dogs I feel my heart pound.”</p>
      <p>Kristina recalls seeing a woman walking two Rottweilers crossing her path before one of them lunged at her on September 18, 2018.</p>
      <p>The art teacher reported the incident to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">Police Scotland</a> but was shocked to hear that officers have taken no action against the owner.</p>

      <p>She later secured justice in the civil <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">courts</a> and received damages, but called on the force and prosecutors to improve its handling of dog bite attacks.</p>
      <p>“There was no reason for that dog to go for me and I don’t know why it did”, she added.</p>
      <p>“I don’t believe in bad breeds, but I do believe there are bad owners and we rely on the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">police</a> to help society and victims by keeping bad owners in check.</p>
      <p>“For there to be no further action then is baffling - I wasn’t even pointed in the direction of other legal help or aftercare.</p>
      <p>“Fiscals or Police Scotland, whoever is responsible, needs to address these failings because a victim shouldn’t have to campaign for their own justice – isn’t that what the justice system is for?”</p>

      <p>Kristina's solicitor, Robert Kernaghan, Partner at Digby Brown’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dundee">Dundee</a> office, said: “This was a truly traumatic incident for our client and despite suffering a terrible physical injury it’s often the scars we don’t see that have the biggest impact.</p>
      <p>“That is why it is vital that victims know there are other ways to secure answers and justice in the absence of criminal prosecutions.</p>
      <p>“Civil law is clear on dog bite cases - if an animal has bitten someone then the owner of that animal is strictly liable, unless of course the animal was acting in self-defence or was goaded into attacking.</p>
      <p>“Digby Brown helps thousands of people every year after suffering from negligence such as road or workplace accidents, asbestos diseases or accidents abroad – and dog bite attacks are no different.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Police Scotland said: "Police were called to the Bridge of Dee roundabout, Aberdeen, around 4.40pm on September 18, 2018, following a report of a woman being bitten by a dog.</p>
      <p>"The woman was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for treatment.</p>
      <p>"Following enquiries, no crime was established and details were passed to the dog warden at Aberdeen City Council."</p>
