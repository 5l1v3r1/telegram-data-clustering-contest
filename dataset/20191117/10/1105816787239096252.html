      <h1>Sesame Street launches muppet show especially for Syrian children</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:33:53+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>The creators of beloved children’s program Sesame Street have collaborated with the International Rescue Committee for a new show geared towards Syrian refugee children.</p>
      <p><i>Ahlan Simsim</i> meaning ‘Welcome Sesame’ won’t focus on teaching numbers and letters like the U.S. based original but will place emphasis on emotions like fear, anger, loneliness, and caring.</p>
      <p>Worldwide, more than half of all refugees are children. And as intractable conflicts drag on for years and years, being a refugee today often means not going home for decades. “We know now that the average length of displacement for a refugee is close to 20 years,” says David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee (IRC).</p>

      <p>“And that’s why it’s a total tragedy that less than 2% of all humanitarian aid funding goes on education, even though half of the world’s refugees are kids.” Only a tiny sliver of that 2% goes to pre-school aged children, who are among the most vulnerable of all.</p>
      <p>In 2016, the MacArthur Foundation offered a $100 million grant to any organization that could “solve a big global problem.” The IRC and Sesame Workshop had already begun collaborating on ways to help the youngest refugees, and they saw an opportunity.</p>
      <p>“We defined the global problem we wanted to tackle was trauma, toxic stress among refugee children in the Middle East,” said Miliband.</p>

      <p>Their joint effort won the grant. Sesame would create a new show; the IRC would drastically ramp up in-person services to refugee kids, including in their makeshift homes.</p>
      <p>CBS News reports that in a featured episode, one of the show’s main characters, a girl Muppet named Basma, decides to make a toy drum to replace the one her best friend Jad had to leave behind when he left his old home.</p>
      <p>The show will air in 20 countries in the Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf starting in February.</p>
