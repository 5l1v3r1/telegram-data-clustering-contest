      <h1>You Don't Look Sick: 'People think I'm too young to be disabled'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:09:04+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://metro.co.uk/author/laura-abernethy/" target="_blank">Laura Abernethy</a></address>
      <p>‘But you don’t look sick’ is something that people with chronic illnesses often hear.</p>
      <p>Others judge them based on their idea of what disability looks like.</p>
      <p>Our series speaks to a different person each week about their experiences of living with a long term condition and how other people treat them.</p>
      <p>Colette Morgan, 29, from Nottingham, has coeliac disease, chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) and most recently, was diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome.</p>
      <p>Living with chronic illness has also contributed to Colette developing anxiety and depression.</p>
      <p>Although she has experienced chronic illness she was diagnosed with CFS/ME as a teenager, her health had improved until surgery on her right ankle in February 2018 triggered CRPS.</p>
      <p>CRPS is a rare condition where the body responds abnormally to an injury, causing pain that is persistent, severe and lasting much longer than usual. </p>
      <p>Colette had planned surgery on the lateral ligaments in her ankle after an injury and she was hopeful it would allow her to run again.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, her ankle didn’t heal as expected and instead she soon found she was unable to put weight on it and it became discoloured and swollen.</p>

      <p>She was diagnosed with CRPS in July 2018, five months after her surgery, after a series of tests and examination by orthopaedic surgeons, neurologists and a pain clinic.</p>
      <p>Colette tells Metro.co.uk: ‘I was really upset, confused and frustrated. I had the surgery on my ankle to repair an injury in the hope of being able to keep fit and active, but instead, I developed an extremely painful and life-changing condition which severely limits my mobility and impedes daily activities. </p>
      <p>‘Before being diagnosed I hadn’t heard of the condition and had no idea how it would affect my life.</p>
      <p>‘I did have experience of chronic illness due to having CFS/M.E as a teenager, my health had gradually improved over time, it was frustrating to think that I would lose all of the progress I had worked so hard to makeover time.’</p>
      <p>Now Colette needs crutches to get around her house as she cannot walk on her ankle and she uses a powerchair when she is out and about.</p>

      <p>Since her condition developed, her life has been turned upside down and she has lost a lot of independence.</p>
      <p>She explains: ‘I typically wake up feeling unrefreshed and in pain, I take medication upon waking up and then rest until it takes affect and I feel able to get up. </p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I need crutches to move anywhere around the house as I cannot weight bear on my right ankle, this makes moving around quite slow and wobbly. When I leave the house I tend to use a powerchair as both CPRS and CFS/ME means I get tired very quickly. </p>
      <p>‘I usually only leave the house every couple of days, typically for medical appointments and chores rather than fun stuff!’</p>

      <p>Colette had lived with depression and anxiety as a teenager but has struggled again with her mental health since developing CRPS.</p>
      <p>This means that as well as the physical difficulties of leaving the house, she doesn’t like to go out without her boyfriend or parents.</p>
      <p>They have been a huge support as she deals with all her health conditions.</p>
      <p>She says: ‘My family and friends are great. I need a huge amount of help around the house from my lovely boyfriend; from helping me to shower to cooking, fetching things and cleaning.</p>

      <p>‘Even on a ‘good’ day I need quite a lot of rest and to only do low energy activities like watching tv or simple crafts.</p>
      <p>‘On bad days I will be in huge amounts of pain and unable to do much more than sleep or nap on the sofa. </p>
      <p>‘I will require extra support from my boyfriend to bring me food and drinks etc. I take eight different medications daily, these do have side effects which can cause additional fatigue and brain fog.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>CRPS also causes extreme sensitivity in the affected area, meaning that anything touching her leg can cause extreme pain.</p>

      <p>‘I struggle with clothing and footwear,’ she says. ‘I can’t tolerate tight socks or tights on my affected foot as it triggers pain. </p>
      <p>‘I have to dress warmly as I don’t regulate my temperature very well and getting cold causes more pain. </p>
      <p>‘I can only wear certain shoes as anything too tight-fitting causes pain. My foot is also permanently swollen. I now need shoes a size and half bigger than before.’</p>
      <p>Although Colette now uses mobility aids all the time, she says that people still say things like ‘you don’t look sick’ because to most people, she looks healthy.</p>
      <p>She says: ‘I have had people say I am too young to be disabled and infer I ought to be walking etc instead. I typically just brush it off.</p>

      <p>‘If I am out and about using my crutches I get a lot of comments and questions, people make the assumption that I have a sports injury or temporary condition. </p>
      <p>‘I find these questions really intrusive and quite upsetting; it is hard to then explain to people I have a permanent condition.</p>
      <p>‘If I use my powerchair I don’t get as many comments, but people will then often ignore me and just talk to my boyfriend rather than me. </p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I do worry that people will judge me for using a powerchair when I can still move and use my legs, I get self-conscious about stretching or fidgeting with my legs.’</p>
      <p>Colette talks about her conditions on her Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/complexlycolette/">@complexlycolette</a> and says that meeting people from the chronic illness community online has helped her feel less isolated.</p>

      <p>She adds: ‘It just helps to be in touch with others who ‘get’ what I am going through.’</p>
      <p>Throughout November, she is posting about living with CRPS for the awareness month associated with the condition.</p>
      <p> She wants people to understand more about her condition and chronic illness in general.</p>
      <p>She says: ‘My use of mobility aids makes my disabilities more visible, but I do feel people ought to be more empathetic towards those with hidden illnesses. </p>
      <p>‘Too often there is an assumption that just because a person is younger, they can’t be disabled. </p>
      <p>‘Things are beginning to change, but more does need to happen. </p>
      <p>‘I also struggle with accessing a lot of places, too many shops/bars/restaurants have steps into the premises and do not provide any form of ramp or way for wheelchair users to access the building.’</p>
