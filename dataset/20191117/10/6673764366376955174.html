      <p><b>FUKUOKA – </b>Hakuho remained alone at the top of the leaderboard after beating Tamawashi at the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Having started the second week of the meet as outright leader, Hakuho made sure it stayed that way by forcing out the No. 4 maegashira in the final bout of Day 8 at Fukuoka Kokusai Center.</p>
      <p>The sole competing yokozuna continued his career dominance over his fellow Mongolian-born wrestler, who has won just one of their 17 top-level meetings.</p>
      <p>Following a pair of false starts, Hakuho (7-1) opened with a hard face slap, then resisted a half-hearted throw attempt as he bundled out Tamawashi (4-4).</p>
      <p>Hakuho, who is pursuing an unprecedented 43rd Emperor’s Cup, will face No. 4 Kotoyuki (4-4) on Day 9.</p>
      <p>The ranks of elite wrestlers at the 15-day tournament thinned even further Sunday with the sudden withdrawal of ozeki Takayasu due to severe lower back pain.</p>
      <p>The Tagonoura stable wrestler, who had taken part in the ring entrance ceremony, dropped to 3-5 after forfeiting his bout against No. 3 Takarafuji (4-4).</p>
      <p>Takayasu joins fellow ozeki Goeido, yokozuna Kakuryu and sekiwake Tochinoshin on the sidelines due to health concerns.</p>
      <p>The only ozeki in action, Takakeisho, had a convincing win by push-out against No. 4 Meisei. The pair collided heavily at the jump, but Takakeisho (5-3) had the momentum and bundled Meisei (4-4) out with little fuss.</p>
      <p>Struggling sekiwake Mitakeumi (4-4) continued clawing toward a respectable record by forcing out No. 5 Aoiyama (4-4).</p>
      <p>The pair opened with an exchange of pushes and slaps, with Mitakeumi nearly losing his balance before driving his Bulgarian-born opponent over the straw.</p>
      <p>The win was the second in a row following three straight losses for the Autumn Grand Tournament winner, who is laboring with a large gash above his right eye.</p>
      <p>Day 8 featured two bouts between komusubi, with Endo (4-4) defeating Hokutofuji (4-4), and Asanoyama (6-2) beating Abi (4-4).</p>
      <p>In a back-and-forth battle, Endo led with his left hand before finding Hokutofuji’s belt with his right and driving him to the straw.</p>
      <p>But Hokutofuji dug in and rallied back with a barrage of blows, almost slapping Endo down. Having survived the attack, Endo regained control and pushed his way to the win.</p>
      <p>Asanoyama stayed one win behind Hakuho with a straightforward victory against Abi. Shrugging off a slapping attack at the opening, Asanoyama calmly collected the win with a quick frontal push-out.</p>
      <p>No. 13 Kagayaki remained in a two-way tie for second at 6-2 following a force-out victory over No. 9 Kotoshogiku (2-6).</p>
      <p>In an unusual display, No. 11 Ishiura used the rare <i>mitokorozeme</i> technique, which involves attacking an opponent’s legs and chest at the same time, to force down No. 14 Nishikigi.</p>
      <p>Ishiura became the first rikishi to use the technique in a basho since Mainoumi in 1993.</p>
