      </p>
      <p>Karisma Kapoor’s style statement has always been high on western dresses, separates and casuals. So, it was indeed a welcome change to see the actress don a traditional suit at the airport. We are loving Lolo’s neutral-toned kurta with bright red and blue floral embroidery.</p>
      <p>Also, we love those braids that clearly enhance her overall look and give a better glimpse at her golden statement earrings. Look at those jootis that perfectly compliment the dress. The Kapoor sisters have seldom failed it on the fashion front, and Lolo’s traditional avatar is a total hit on our style meter.</p>

      <p>We advice the gorgeous actress to bring out more of such ethnic pieces. While we have seen her nail it in those western outfits, this comes as a welcome change and it’s good to go experimental at times right?!<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- Viral Bhayani</i></p>
