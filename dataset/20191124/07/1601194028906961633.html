      <h3>Asuka and Kairi Sane as a team</h3>
      <p>WWE Superstars <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/asuka">Asuka</a> and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/kairi-sane">Kairi Sane</a> were introduced as a tag team by Paige on the April 16, 2019 episode of WWE SmackDown. After feuding with then-WWE Tag Team Champions The IIconics - Billie Kay and Peyton Royce, the team went on a hiatus.</p>
      <p>They returned in September and scored a victory over Fire &amp; Desire - Mandy Rose and Sonya Deville. That win earned them an opportunity at winning the Women's Tag Team Championships from the team of Alexa Bliss and Nikki Cross. They defeated Bliss and Cross at this year's Hell in a Cell after Asuka used the green mist on Cross.</p>
      <p>The next night on RAW, they turned heel after they cut a scathing promo on RAW Women's Champion Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair in their native Japanese. They then defeated Lynch and Flair in a non-title match on the same night and Asuka used the green mist on Lynch.</p>
      <p>The Kabuki Warriors were drafted to RAW as a part of the 2019 WWE Draft and on the October 28 episode of RAW, they turned on Paige after Asuka spew the green mist on her.</p>
