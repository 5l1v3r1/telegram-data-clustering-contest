      <h1>This Christmas to be most expensive season of last decade</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:42:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>New figures show that this Christmas is set to be the most expensive festive season of the last decade.</p>
      <p>Double-digit inflation on travel costs and socialising means the price of the season is set to hit the Celtic Tiger peak.</p>
      <p>TAn analysis of new CSO data shows that the cost of Christmas has reached a ten year high.</p>
      <p>According to today's Sunday Independent this is mainly due to the recent price growth on items consumers typically spend more on over the festive season.</p>
      <p>Driving home for Christmas means spending around 25% more on fuel</p>
      <p>The cost of socialising in bars and restaurants is up by around 15%; while at home, tv services are up 17% while the cost of home heating has risen 37%.</p>
      <p>And anyone considering putting up Christmas lights should be aware- electricity is up 38% since 2009.</p>
      <p>It is predicted that inflation will continue to rise by about 1% in 2020.</p>
