      <h1>Motherwell defender makes outrageous Sadio Mane claim and eyes dream Liverpool transfer</h1>
      <h2>Motherwell defender Bevis Mugabi reckons played against Sadio Mane in the African Cup of Nations</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Kathryn Batte</a></address>
      <p>Motherwell defender Bevis Mugabi is certainly not short of confidence.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old might only have made four appearances in the Scottish Premier League this season but he's backing himself to turn out for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool </a>one day.</p>
      <p>This comes after the Uganda international played against <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/sadio-mane">Sadio Mane</a>'s Senegal in the African Cup of Nations last summer and Mugabi is adamant he had the Reds' forward under control.</p>
      <p>"I played against Sadio Mane in the last 16 of the African Cup of Nations and that was a good experience. I think he’s still in my pocket!" he told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bevis-mugabi-up-motherwell-challenge-20936236">Daily Record</a>.</p>
      <p>"Maybe it will get me a move to Liverpool."</p>
      <p>Ironically, Mane scored the only goal in the game in question and it was none other than Mugabi who was closest to him when the Liverpool man converted.</p>
      <p>The defender shared a changing room with Mane when they were both at Southampton and acknowledged the forward's talent.</p>
      <p>"His sharpness in the game and his decision-making was so much quicker than everyone else's, and that's borne out in the amount of goals that he's scored.</p>

      <p>"I think that's the only difference between being an elite player and an average player. that quick thought process and the sharpness that you can carry it out.</p>
      <p>"I was at Southampton with him as well, so I've seen his progression from being at Southampton to making that steup up to Liverpool, and now he's probably one of the best players in the world.</p>
      <p>"I definitely feel that I have the attributes to make that step up too. I just need the right coaching, and I feel like I’ve developed here [at Motherwell] as a player already with the gaffer’s style of play.</p>
      <p>"As long as I keep getting game-time and improving every day in training, I’m sure I can make that step up to a higher division."</p>
      <p>Mugabi might be dreaming of a move to Liverpool but he'll likely have to start more games for Motherwell before Sadio puts a word in for him - that's if he's made it out of his back pocket by then.</p>
