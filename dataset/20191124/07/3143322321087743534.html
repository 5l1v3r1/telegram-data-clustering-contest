      <p>It aimed to raise funds for the non-profit organisation (NPO), which provides lifesaving assistance and operations to children in local communities and throughout Africa.</p>
      <p>Founder, Dr Andre Hattingh, said that children are the innocent and fragile victims of their circumstances.</p>
      <blockquote>“They are totally dependent on their parents or the government for help.”<br/>Dave Walters handled the auction and encouraged everybody to, “make a difference to that one special child”.</blockquote>
      <p>Corporate fund-raiser for Pediatric Care Africa, Lee Melman, shared some of the organisation’s remarkable initiatives.</p>
      <p>They provide basic medical equipment, establish a functioning and sustainable prenatal and postnatal clinic in war-torn and disaster areas, identify special needs children in dire need of highly specialised surgery, supply commercial baby formula and food to malnourished babies, and supply qualified and registered medical doctors, nurses, laboratory staff and X-ray technicians to governmental and non-governmental hospitals and clinics.</p>
