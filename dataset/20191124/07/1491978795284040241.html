        <i>Aslan King, who is from Bristol, may have become disoriented, say police</i>
      </p>
      <p>The search to find a British tourist who went missing on Victoriaâ€™s Great Ocean Road on Saturday will be scaled back for the night and resume on Monday.</p>
      <p>Aslan King, 25, was camping with friends at Princetown, near the Twelve Apostles, when he hit his head about 2am on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He suddenly got up and ran off into the bushland but his friends could not find him.</p>
      <p>The police helicopter, officers riding horses, off-road motorcycles, and ground crews have been looking high and low to find King, who has been in Australia for two weeks.</p>
      <p>King is of medium build with short hair and was wearing trackpants, a light grey T-shirt and hoodie with green Reebok sneakers when he fled.</p>
      <p>He may have blood on his forehead.</p>
