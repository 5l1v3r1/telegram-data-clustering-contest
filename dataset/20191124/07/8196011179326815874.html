      <p>Comedian Andrew Maxwell broke down in tears on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! as he revealed he considered quitting the show.</p>
      <p>The Irish stand-up star became tearful during an exchange with co-stars James Haskell and Jacqueline Jossa in Saturday’s episode of the jungle-based reality show.</p>

      <p>Following a vote that saw Haskell chosen as the camp leader, and him picking Jossa as his deputy, Maxwell went into their newly-erected leaders cabin and sat on one of the beds.</p>
      <p>In Haskell’s absence, he told ex-EastEnders star Jossa: “I honestly thought that I was going to walk out, but I haven’t, when you’re tired, you just say ‘Have I done the right thing?'”</p>
      <p>The actress told him: “You’d never leave, I can tell that, you’re just tired.”</p>
      <p>Maxwell, 43, then started to cry as Haskell returned from having a shower.</p>
      <p>Jossa, 27, told Haskell that Maxwell was tired, and that “he’s been sleeping on the floor, he’s had six nights on the floor”.</p>
      <p>Former rugby player Haskell, 34, told the comedian that he is “an important part of the group, and we need you”, before advising him to eat some food.</p>
      <p>Maxwell replied that he is “just so tired”, and Jossa noted: “You’ve spent over two weeks away from your family, it’s a long time.”</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m just a little bit overwhelmed right now.”</p>

      <p>Haskell told his campmate that he is “brilliant”, and brings “so much energy and laughter” before promising to look after him.</p>
      <p>The sports star was chosen by the others in the jungle in a secret ballot vote to become the camp leader, giving him the power to rule over the others.</p>
      <p>He and his deputy Jossa are exempt from all camp chores.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn Jenner, who has become close to Haskell, quipped: “Our romance is over you picked someone else.”</p>
      <p>But Haskell told her: “No, no, the leader always has time for all the women in his life, don’t worry about that.”</p>
      <p>The latest episode of I’m A Celebrity also saw the 12 famous contestants face a stomach-churning trial, in which some of them had to hold critters in their mouths to free their co-stars from a jungle jail.</p>
      <p>The challenge saw Ian Wright gingerly hold a Huntsman spider between his lips for one minute and Roman Kemp keep a scorpion in his mouth.</p>
      <p>The second part of the trial, dubbed The Pest Office, saw others have to eat a jungle “delicacy” if their name was pulled from a hat.</p>
      <p>Haskell and Jenner were the first to be picked, and they each had to eat a cow’s eye.</p>
      <p>Nadine Coyle and Adele Roberts were then picked to eat a cow’s anus, both of them retching and struggling but ultimately succeeding.</p>
      <p>The trial was a success as the stars won 12 out of 12 stars, meaning they won a full feast to eat back at camp.</p>
      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! continues on ITV.</p>
