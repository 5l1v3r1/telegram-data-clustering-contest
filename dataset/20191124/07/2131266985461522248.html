      <p>Brisbane Broncos have re-signed veteran Kiwis back-rower and potential captain Alex Glenn for another two NRL seasons.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old looms as a replacement for under-fire Broncos leader Darius Boyd next season, after finally ending speculation and officially inking a deal until the end of 2021.</p>
      <p>The veteran of 259 NRL games reportedly knocked back interest from Penrith to remain at Red Hill.</p>

      <p>Glenn looks forward to stepping up in the absence of retired Matt Gillett, and providing guidance to a young Broncos outfit featuring David Fifita, Payne Haas and Kotoni Staggs.</p>
      <p>"I've enjoyed being a leader for these boys," said Glenn. "We've had 12 debutants in 2019 and they have all deserved their jersey this year.</p>
      <p>"But the thing that kept me going hard every single week was competing with these boys - they'll never beat me on my efforts."</p>
      <p>Broncos coach Anthony Seibold said Glenn's experience would be vital, as they begin life after 200-game veteran forward Gillett next year.</p>
      <p>"His consistency sets a great example for our whole squad and his leadership is important to the players at our club working to fulfil their potential," he said.</p>
      <p>"He always works hard and always gives his all - we want everyone at this club to follow the example that he sets."</p>
      <p>Brisbane will hope there are more player announcements to come.</p>
      <p>Boom forward Fifita - off contract in 2020 - is still in talks with the Broncos, while out-of-favour Melbourne halfback Brodie Croft is reportedly bound for Red Hill.</p>
      <p>News Corp said Brisbane may announce Croft's signing as soon as Monday, pending a release from the Storm.</p>
