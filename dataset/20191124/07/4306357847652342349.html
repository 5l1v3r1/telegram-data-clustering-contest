      <h2>Liverpool FC manager Jurgen Klopp says Xherdan Shaqiri is still part of his plans at the Anfield outfit</h2>

      <h3>Jurgen Klopp says Xherdan Shaqiri still has a future at Liverpool FC after recovering from a long-term injury.</h3>
      <p>The Switzerland international’s future has been a source of debate during the international break due to a lack of first-team opportunities at the Premier League leaders.</p>
      <p>Shaqiri has only featured in 25 minutes of competitive football so far this season, although the former Stoke City playmaker missed six weeks with a calf problem.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old hasn’t started a game since he was a surprise inclusion in Klopp’s starting line up for their 4-0 victory over FC Barcelona at Anfield in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final.</p>
      <p>Shaqiri has been <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/sources-liverpool-big-name-tells-friends-he-wants-to-quit/">linked</a> with a potential move in recent weeks due to his lack of first-team opportunities at Liverpool FC.</p>
      <p>Speaking at his pre-match media conference at Melwood training ground ahead of Liverpool FC’s trip to Crystal Palace on Saturday, Klopp said of Shaqiri:</p>
      <p>“Yes, he offers an option in attack, but he needs to be fit for that.</p>
      <p>“That is all we are concerned about at the moment. He was out long and he trained and was really good in moments and in other moments it was different to the rehab stuff he did before.</p>
      <p>“All good, the most intense period is coming so he will be ready for that hopefully if nothing happens again and you will see him on the pitch, 100%.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC were 3-1 winners against defending Premier League champions Manchester City in their last Premier League outing before the international break.</p>
      <p>The Reds won the Champions League title last season to end their title drought under the former Borussia Dortmund head coach in his third full season in charge.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC finished in second place in the Premier League table last term.</p>
