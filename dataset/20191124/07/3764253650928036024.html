      <p>The quintuplets; three boys and two baby girls were placed in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the hospital and are reportedly hale and hearty.</p>
      <p>According to Daily Trust, the nurses stated that four of the babies were born healthy, measuring the average weight of a newborn, except one who was underweight and was weighed 1.9 Kg.</p>
      <p>In her interview with Daily Trust, Egenti said within her 16 years of marriage, she had taken all medical options (except IVF) to get a baby but to no avail until she had the quintuplets. She said she resorted to traditional/herbal remedies to conceive a child but that was also futile, leaving her in perpetual despair.</p>
