      <p>Remember the Nissan Sentra? Well, an all-new version was recently revealed in the United States, where the nameplate remains the Japanese firm’s all-time best seller.</p>
      <p>The eighth-generation Sentra (previewed by the <a href="https://www.carmag.co.za/news/new-models/new-nissan-sylphy-unveiled-previewing-next-sentra/">Sylphy</a>) runs on a new platform that Nissan claims provides “greatly improved proportions and stance” (it’s about 50 mm lower and 50 mm wider than the outgoing model).</p>
      <p>The styling incorporates Nissan's latest design language, including the signature V-motion grille, slim LED headlamps and so-called "floating roof". The latest version of the sedan furthermore features new wheel designs and a range of fresh colours, including three new two-tone options.</p>
      <p>Inside, Nissan claims the new Sentra is “more refined and luxurious” than its forebear, featuring heated front seats trimmed in leather and the firm’s latest 360-degree camera system. You’ll also notice the eight-inch touchscreen display, which boasts Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality.</p>
      <p>Power comes from a new naturally aspirated 2,0-litre, four-cylinder petrol engine offering peak outputs 111 kW and 198 N.m. The automaker furthermore claims the Sentra’s handling abilities have been “greatly improved” thanks to the adoption of a new independent rear suspension and revised steering.</p>
      <p>In May 2017, the Sentra nameplate quietly left South Africa's new vehicle market. Given the current state of the local sedan market, we’re highly unlikely to see the new Sentra here...</p>
