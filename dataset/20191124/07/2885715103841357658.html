      <p>A patrolling team of Railway Protection Force (RPF) saved a 20-year-old student, who was being molested by a group of men, near Alandi railway station on Friday. According to the RPF, during the section patrolling near Alandi railway station around 10.30 pm, Inspector P C C Kasar of RPF, Ghorpadi and his staff B G Konde and N R Kumbhar noticed an abandoned two-wheeler.</p>
      <p>When RPF staff flashed their torchlight towards the spot, they saw an unknown person running away by crossing the railway track. They also found the girl near LC Gate lodge. The RPF, in its press release, said the woman is a journalism student. She came to the spot along with her three male friends in a four-wheeler. A group of around seven to eight persons armed with swords, iron rods came on two-wheelers and started harassing them, the release said.</p>
      <p>The male friends of the 20-year-old allegedly fled the spot, leaving her alone, the RPF said. The miscreants took the girl to an abandoned spot and started molesting her. They fled when they saw the RPF patrolling team, the release stated.</p>
      <p>The RPF team then secured the girl and informed the Pune Rural police. An offence was lodged at Loni Kalbhor police station against the unidentified accused on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Police Inspector Suraj Bandgar of Loni Kalbhor police station said, “We have identified some of the accused and investigation is on to nab all of them. We will also be conducting inquiry of the boys who had accompanied the girl but later left her alone. Also, we will be speaking to the authorities of the girl’s college and sensitise them.”</p>
