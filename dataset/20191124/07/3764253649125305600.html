      <p><i>"A lot of nurturing, love, and care from family and friends made me who I am today. Honestly, it would take a whole day to enumerate all the factors and traits that have played into the person that I am, but most importantly, I am grateful to God for the amalgam of characteristics he bestowed on me,”</i> she said.</p>
      <p>In talking about how Nigeria’s image can be redeemed, she said that the government and the individuals all have a major role to play in that regard.</p>
