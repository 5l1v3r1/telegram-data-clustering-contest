      <h3>Minor setback</h3>
      <p>During its unveiling, the Cybertruck suffered a minor setback when it saw its armored glass windows shattered. This came as a shock to Musk who said they had run extensive tests before.</p>
      <p>"We threw wrenches, we threw everything even literally the kitchen sink at the glass and it didn't break. For some weird reason, it broke now," Musk said Thursday. "I don't know why. We will fix it in post."</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck has a range of up to <b>500 miles</b> on a single charge. In a tweet that Musk has pinned at the top of his Twitter, he describes the car as "Better truck than an F-150, faster than a Porsche 911."</p>
