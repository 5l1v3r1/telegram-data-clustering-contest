      <h1>Higuain keeps Juventus top as Inter maintain chase</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:33:01+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>MILAN: </b>Gonzalo Higuain grabbed a second-half brace to fire Juventus to a 3-1 win at Atalanta that kept the champions top of Serie A on Saturday, despite Inter Milan’s comfortable 3-0 win at Torino that kept them in touch with the leaders.</p>
      <p>Maurizio Sarri’s Juve left it late to seal victory in Bergamo after Robin Gosens had nodded Atalanta ahead after 56 minutes.</p>
      <p>But Higuain hit back with two goals in eight minutes before Paulo Dybala marked his 200th Serie A appearance with the third goal one minute into injury time.</p>
      <p>Juve stay one point ahead of second-placed Inter Milan, who outplayed Torino in torrential rain in Turin, as Atalanta drop to sixth place after their fourth league game without a win.</p>
      <p>“We suffered, but in the final 20 minutes we gave everything we had to bring the win home,” said Sarri.</p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo missed the trip despite his four-goal spree for Portugal as he recovers from a knee problem ahead of Juve’s Champions League game against Atletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>“I hope Cristiano will be back for the Champions League on Tuesday,” said Sarri.</p>
      <p>“We’re solving this knee problem that has been bothering him for a while. Playing with a hint of pain will tire you out psychologically.</p>
      <p>“So far he has trained in the right way, so as not to overload his knee.”</p>

      <p>Higuain pulled Juventus level after 74 minutes with a ball that took a deflection off Rafael Toloi to beat Pierluigi Gollini in the Atalanta goal.</p>
      <p>The Argentine completed his double when he picked up a cross from Juan Cuadrado, who had put his hand on the ball during a sliding tackle at the start of the move.</p>
      <p>Then Dybala broke through the Atalanta defence to score his fourth Serie A goal this season.</p>
      <p>“It was a great test of maturity in a difficult field, three fundamental points for the championship,” said Higuain.</p>
      <p>Atalanta had their chances, with Musa Barrow missing an early penalty as the Bergamo side chased their first Serie A win over Juventus since February 2001.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old Gambian rattled the crossbar after 17 minutes after a spot-kick was awarded for a Sami Khedira handball.</p>
      <p>“Atalanta had perhaps their best performance this season and deserved to win, until that unlucky equaliser. That was the turning point,” said Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini.</p>
      <p>In Turin, Inter Milan earned their first win in three years over Torino despite difficult conditions with the game starting 10 minutes late because of heavy rainfall in northern Italy.</p>
      <p>Torino captain and Italy forward Andrea Belotti went off after 10 minutes after falling on the water-logged pitch, while Nicolo Barella was forced off a soaked pitch with a knee injury in the final minutes of the first half.</p>

      <p>Barella said he “felt the knee go click” and Inter later said the Italy international had suffered a sprained knee and would need further tests.</p>
      <p>“I hope it’s nothing serious because he’s he’s a warrior, an important player for us,” said coach Antonio Conte.</p>
      <p>A minute after Belotti’s departure Lautaro Martinez opened the scoring, before Stefan de Vrij volleyed in a Cristiano Biraghi cross just after the half an hour mark.</p>
      <p>Romelu Lukaku hit his 10th league goal of the campaign in the 55th minutes as Inter hammered home their title credentials.</p>
      <p>Antonio Conte’s side are 10 points ahead of third-placed Lazio and Cagliari, who play lowly Lecce and Sassuolo respectively on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy above all for the lads who are getting big results,” said Conte, “but the thing that makes me happiest is that we didn’t concede today.”</p>
      <p>But the pressure is mounting on Napoli coach Carlo Ancelotti ahead of his side’s Champions League trip to Liverpool midweek following their disappointing 1-1 draw at the San Siro.</p>
      <p>Serie A runners-up for the past two seasons, Napoli sit are seventh, 15 points behind Juve after 13 games and the stalemate is a poor result for a team that had title ambitions in the summer.</p>
      <p>Milan are struggling in 13th position with just one point from their last three games.</p>
