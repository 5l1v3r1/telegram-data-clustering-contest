      <h1>Fury's coach identifies key weakness in Wilder after 'poor' display vs Ortiz</h1>

      <p>Ben Davison believes many people will have branded <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/deontay-wilder/">Deontay Wilder</a>’s performance against Luis Ortiz ‘poor’ and believes <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tyson-fury/">Tyson Fury</a> has clearly left his mark on the WBC champion.</p>
      <p>Ortiz was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/deontay-wilder-pulls-off-stunning-comeback-scorecards-revealed-luis-ortiz-rematch-11208296/">knocked out in the seventh round by Wilder</a> after falling behind on the scorecards in the rematch.</p>
      <p>Wilder took time to figure out his range against Ortiz and Davison, Fury’s coach, thinks the WBC champion struggled with the pressure of his upcoming rematch with the Gypsy King.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve said before, Luis Ortiz is a fantastic fighter but he’s not Tyson Fury,’ Davison told Sky Sports after the fight.</p>

      <p>‘I also learned that he was a different man fight week to what he was to when he fought Tyson.</p>

      <p>‘Tyson 100 per cent got under his skin, I definitely saw that in there, which is pretty understandable.</p>
      <p>‘Pressure of a big fight around the corner affected him.</p>
      <p>‘People will say he looked poor, but he took his time and he did what he was supposed to do.’</p>
      <p>Team Fury were furious to learn Wilder had put the 22 February rematch at risk with his scheduling of the Ortiz fight in November, but that bout now appears set to go ahead.</p>

      <p>Wilder did not appear to pick up any injuries and was not hurt in the fight before unleashing a skull-crunching right hand.</p>

      <p>‘Obviously his power is something you have to negate,’ he said.</p>

      <p>‘Mentally, Tyson is the strongest fighter I’ve come across in history and he’s proved that on a number of occasions.</p>
      <p>‘How do we do it? I’m not going to say my ideas on how you would do it. But it’s definitely not what Luis Ortiz just did there.</p>
      <p>‘Fair play to him, he had a good go but he got complacent and walked straight into distance. That’s a recipe for disaster.’</p>
