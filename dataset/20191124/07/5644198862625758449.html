      <p>THE HAUGE:Â Former Dutch football great Marco van Basten apologised Saturday (Nov 23) after he was heard using a Nazi greeting to ridicule a Dutch television journalist's German during an interview.</p>
      <p>Van Basten, 55, who is regarded as one of the game's best ever strikers, made the comment on Fox Sports pay-to-view channel after an interview ahead of the Eredivisie clash between Ajax and Heracles.</p>

      <p>His words could be heard in the studio moments after TV presenter Hans Kraay's interview in German with Heracles' German manager Frank Wormuth.</p>
      <p>"Not too pretty, sieg heil, pfannkuchen (pancake)," Van Basten said, using the Nazi German greeting during World War II.</p>
      <p>His words unleased a Twitter storm and during half-time in the match the former Ajax and Ac Milan forward made his excuses for what he termed an "ill-placed joke".</p>
      <p>"It was not my intention at all to shock people. I only wanted to 'explain' Hans' German," a contrite Van Basten said.</p>
      <p>But Van Basten's misplaced comment left many fuming, not only because of what he said but also about its timing.</p>
      <p>Football clubs in the Netherlands are taking active measures to fight racism following an incident last weekend when racist chants caused a second division match to be halted.</p>
      <p>The referee briefly suspended Sunday's game between Excelsior Rotterdam and Den Bosch and Excelsior winger Ahmad Mendes Moreira walked off the pitch.Van basten</p>
      <p>Moreira said he heard monkey noises and songs about "Black Pete", a traditional Dutch Christmas-time character that appears in blackface and attracts accusations of racist stereotyping, Dutch media reported.</p>
      <p>Fox Sports also apologised for Van Basten's comments, the daily Algemeen Dagblad reported.</p>
      <p>"His comments were inappropriate. Not only for today, but for every day," a spokesman told the paper.</p>
