      <h1>Top 25 football roundup: No. 2 Ohio State holds off No. 8 Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:32:16+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:32</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>No. 2 Ohio State overcame three fumbles and a second-half rally by No. 8 Penn State to emerge with a 28-17 win in Columbus, Ohio, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Ohio State (11-0, 8-0 Big Ten) clinched the East Division, but it wasn’t easy, as the Nittany Lions (9-2, 6-2) almost erased a 21-point, third-quarter deficit.</p>
      <p>After the Buckeyes saw their 21-0 lead shrink to 21-17, Justin Fields threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to Chris Olave with 13:18 left in the fourth quarter for the final margin.</p>
      <p>Fields was 16 for 22 for 188 yards and two TDs. He added 68 yards on the ground but lost two fumbles. Junior J.K. Dobbins rushed for 157 yards on 36 carries and two TDs for the Buckeyes but also lost a fumble that contributed to Penn State scoring touchdowns 25 seconds apart.</p>
      <p>No. 1 LSU 56, Arkansas 20</p>
      <p>Clyde Edwards-Helaire rushed for 188 yards and three touchdowns as the host Tigers overcame a slow start to rout the Razorbacks and clinch the SEC West Division title in Baton Rouge, La.</p>
      <p>Edwards-Helaire had just six carries and scored on runs of 27, 26 and 89 yards. He also caught seven passes for 65 yards. The back stole a bit of the spotlight from presumed Heisman Trophy front-runner Joe Burrow, who had what has become a routine performance for him with 327 yards and three touchdowns.</p>
      <p>The Tigers will face East division champion Georgia in the SEC Championship Game on Dec. 7. LSU won its first division title since 2011, and a home victory against Texas A&amp;M next Saturday would match that team as the only ones in school history to have a 12-0 regular season.</p>
      <p>No. 4 Georgia 19, Texas A&amp;M 13</p>
      <p>In a game dominated by defense, the host Bulldogs made the biggest stops late, then rode their running back to close out the game and top the Aggies in an SEC clash in Athens, Ga.</p>
      <p>Leading 19-6, Georgia (10-1, 7-1) appeared to have the game in control until Texas A&amp;M (7-4, 4-3) drove 75 yards in 10 plays, drawing within six on a 19-yard pass from Kellen Mond to Jhamon Ausbon with 11:16 left.</p>
      <p>Following a Bulldogs punt, the Aggies took the ball and looked poised to take the lead. But the drive stalled at the Georgia 43, after seven plays and 47 yards, and Texas A&amp;M punted with 4:26 to play rather than go for it on fourth-and-11. Georgia held onto the ball the rest of the game, getting a trio of first-down runs by D’Andre Swift (19 carries, 103 yards) to run out the clock.</p>
      <p>No. 5 Alabama 66, Western Carolina 3</p>
      <p>Sophomore quarterback Mac Jones passed for 275 yards and three touchdowns in a little over a half as the Crimson Tide rolled over the FCS Catamounts in Tuscaloosa, Ala.</p>
      <p>Injured starter Tua Tagovailoa sat in a cart and watched from the sideline as his replacement completed 10 of 12 passes before true freshman Taulia Tagovailoa, Tua’s younger brother, took over in the third quarter and threw his first touchdown pass.</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide (10-1) ran their streak of 10-win seasons to 12 as they picked off quarterback Tyrie Adams four times, including one that safety Xavier McKinney returned 81 yards for a touchdown. Western Carolina (3-9) got its only points on Julian Pletz’s 38-yard field goal to start the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Arizona State 31, No. 6 Oregon 28</p>
      <p>Sun Devils freshman Jayden Daniels passed for a career-high 408 yards and three touchdowns as his team likely knocked the Ducks out of the College Football Playoff discussion with an upset victory in Tempe, Ariz.</p>
      <p>Daniels completed 22 of 32 passes, while wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk had seven receptions for 161 yards and a late touchdown to help seal it. Frank Darby added four catches for a season-high 125 yards as Arizona State (6-5, 3-5 Pac-12) broke a four-game losing streak and became bowl eligible.</p>
      <p>The Sun Devils gained 535 total yards, a season-high allowed by the Ducks (9-2, 7-1), who had a nine-game winning streak snapped. Oregon had previously not allowed an opponent to top 450 total yards in a game.</p>
      <p>No. 7 Utah 35, Arizona 7</p>
      <p>Senior running back Zack Moss ran for a season-high 203 yards, including a 41-yard touchdown, as the Utes controlled the Wildcats throughout in Tucson, Ariz.</p>
      <p>Moss carried 26 times as Utah (10-1, 7-1 Pac-12) won its seventh consecutive game, rushed for a season-high 297 yards and held Arizona to 196 total yards on its Senior Night.</p>
      <p>Utah needs to beat Colorado next Saturday at home to win the Pac-12 South. If it loses, USC will go to the conference title game to face North champ Oregon. Arizona (4-7, 2-6) dropped its sixth game in a row and will miss the postseason for the second consecutive season.</p>
      <p>No. 9 Oklahoma 28, TCU 24</p>
      <p>Jalen Hurts led the Sooners to touchdowns on their first three possessions, and they hung on despite second-half turnovers to beat the Horned Frogs in a Big 12 matchup in Norman, Okla.</p>
      <p>The win assured the Sooners a spot in the Big 12 title game against the Baylor Bears, whom Oklahoma rallied from 25 points down to beat 34-31 last Saturday.</p>
      <p>Hurts threw for two touchdowns and rushed for another in the game’s first 17 minutes as Oklahoma (10-1, 7-1) sped to a 21-0 lead. He added a rushing touchdown about midway through the third quarter.</p>
      <p>No. 10 Minnesota 38, Northwestern 22</p>
      <p>Tanner Morgan threw four touchdown passes, three to Rashod Bateman, and the Golden Gophers set a school record for most Big Ten wins in a season by defeating the Wildcats in Evanston, Ill.</p>
      <p>Minnesota (10-1, 7-1 Big Ten), which bounced back from a loss at Iowa, had never previously won more than six Big Ten games. Morgan completed 15 of 23 passes for 211 yards. Bateman caught seven passes for 78 yards, while Tyler Johnson hauled in seven for 125 yards and one score.</p>
      <p>After Northwestern starter Hunter Johnson left early with concussion-like symptoms, backup Andrew Marty passed for 95 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 52 yards and two scores for the Wildcats (2-9, 0-8).</p>
      <p>No. 12 Wisconsin 45, Purdue 24</p>
      <p>Jonathan Taylor rushed for 222 yards on 28 carries to lead the Badgers past the Boilermakers in a Big Ten West division matchup in Madison, Wis.</p>
      <p>Taylor scored one touchdown and fumbled twice. The performance marked the junior’s 12th career 200-yard rushing performance.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Jack Coan completed 15 of 19 passes for 203 yards and two scores for the Badgers (9-2, 6-2). He had one interception.</p>
      <p>No. 13 Michigan 39, Indiana 14</p>
      <p>Senior Shea Patterson threw for 366 yards and tied a Wolverines record with five touchdown passes in a Big Ten victory against the Hoosiers in Bloomington, Ind.</p>
      <p>Junior Nico Collins had six catches for 165 yards and three TDs for Michigan (9-2, 6-2), which will take a four-game winning streak into next week’s showdown against rival No. 2 Ohio State.</p>
      <p>Indiana (7-4, 4-4) got off to a strong start, but was unable to sustain it for both halves. The Hoosiers dropped to 0-14 against ranked teams in head coach Tom Allen’s three-year tenure.</p>
      <p>No. 14 Baylor 24, Texas 10</p>
      <p>Charlie Brewer passed for 221 yards and a touchdown and ran for 75 yards and another score as the Bears rolled over the overmatched Longhorns in Big 12 Conference action in Waco, Texas.</p>
      <p>With the victory, Baylor (10-1, 7-1) clinched a spot in the Big 12 championship game and a rematch with Oklahoma, who handed the Bears their only loss on Nov. 16.</p>
      <p>Denzel Mims caught seven passes for 125 yards for Baylor in the win, its first against Texas (6-5, 4-4) since 2014. Longhorns quarterback Sam Ehlinger was held without a touchdown through the air or on the ground for the first time this season. He was sacked five times and threw an interception.</p>
      <p>No. 15 Auburn 52, Samford 0</p>
      <p>JaTarvious Whitlow ran for two touchdowns, and the Tigers thoroughly dominated the visiting Bulldogs of the FCS in their final preparation before Alabama comes to town.</p>
      <p>Bo Nix was 15 of 23 for 150 yards and one touchdown in little more than one half for Auburn (8-3), which will return to Jordan-Hare Stadium next Saturday to play the rival Crimson Tide in the Iron Bowl.</p>
      <p>Auburn backup quarterback Cord Sandberg, a 24-year-old redshirt freshman who played six seasons in the Philadelphia Phillies’ minor league system, threw his first two career TD passes — both to Zach Farrar — in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>No. 16 Notre Dame 40, Boston College 7</p>
      <p>Ian Book passed for 239 yards and three touchdowns, and Jonathan Doerer kicked four field goals as the Fighting Irish cruised past the Eagles in South Bend, Ind.</p>
      <p>Notre Dame (9-2) outscored BC (5-6) 24-0 after halftime while outgaining the Eagles 501-191 for the game. Book helped steer the Fighting Irish to 34 unanswered points to close the game, completing 26 of 40 passes while connecting with Chase Claypool, Cole Kmet and Chris Finke for touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Boston College grabbed a 7-6 lead with 7:56 remaining in the second quarter. Eagles quarterback Dennis Grosel, who went 9-for-20 passing for 63 yards and an interception, capped a 16-play, 84-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown run.</p>
      <p>No. 17 Iowa 19, Illinois 10</p>
      <p>Keith Duncan made four field goals and quarterback Nate Stanley passed for 308 yards to lead the Hawkeyes over the Illini in Iowa City, Iowa.</p>
      <p>Stanley completed 18 of 35 passes with one interception. Wide receiver Ihmir Smith-Marsette caught four passes for 121 yards for Iowa (8-3, 5-3 Big Ten). Duncan made attempts from 23, 45, 24 and 29 yards.</p>
      <p>Illinois (6-5, 4-4) cut its deficit to 16-10 with 10:52 remaining on a 28-yard field goal by James McCourt, but quarterback Brandon Peters lost a fumble on Illinois’ next possession, leading to Duncan’s final field goal with 2:44 remaining.</p>
      <p>No. 18 Memphis 49, South Florida 10</p>
      <p>Brady White passed for all of his 222 yards in the first half, and Patrick Taylor celebrated his return from a foot injury by rushing for 95 yards and three touchdowns as the Tigers overcame a sputtering start to blast the Bulls in Tampa, Fla.</p>
      <p>Memphis (10-1, 6-1 American Athletic Conference) stayed on pace with Navy in the AAC West race with its fifth consecutive victory. The Tigers can clinch a berth in the league’s championship game with a win at home Friday against East-leading Cincinnati.</p>
      <p>Kenneth Gainwell ran for 128 yards for the Tigers, who gained 560 yards of offense and outscored South Florida 42-0 over the last three quarters. The Bulls (4-7, 2-5) saw their hopes to clinch bowl eligibility burst with a third straight loss.</p>
      <p>No. 19 Cincinnati 15, Temple 13</p>
      <p>Sam Crosa kicked two field goals, Coby Bryant returned a blocked extra point for two points, and the Bearcats edged the visiting Owls to win the American Athletic Conference’s East Division title.</p>
      <p>The title was the first in Cincinnati history and puts the Bearcats (10-1, 7-0 AAC) in the conference’s championship game on Dec. 7. Michael Warren II rushed for 106 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries for Cincinnati, which won its ninth consecutive game.</p>
      <p>Temple (7-4, 4-3) got 228 yards with a touchdown and an interception from quarterback Anthony Russo and won the yardage battled 310-210 but failed on a number of crucial special teams plays.</p>
      <p>No. 20 Boise State 56, Utah State 21</p>
      <p>Jaylon Henderson passed for three touchdowns, and George Holani rushed for a career-best 178 yards and scored two touchdowns as the Broncos annihilated the Aggies in Mountain West play at Logan, Utah.</p>
      <p>Avery Williams returned a punt for a touchdown for the second time this season and fourth in his career for Boise State (10-1, 7-0), who clinched the Mountain Division title and a spot in the conference championship game on Dec. 7 against West Division winner Hawaii.</p>
      <p>Jordan Love completed 21 of 36 passes for 229 yards, one touchdown and one interception — which was returned for a touchdown by Jalen Walker — for Utah State (6-5, 5-2).</p>
      <p>No. 21 Oklahoma State 20, West Virginia 13</p>
      <p>Dru Brown tossed two touchdowns in his first start for the Cowboys, and Chuba Hubbard tallied his ninth straight 100-yard rushing game in a Big 12 win against the Mountaineers in Morgantown, W.Va.</p>
      <p>A fifth-year senior who transferred from Hawaii in 2018, Brown replaced the injured Spencer Sanders and completed 22 of 29 passes for 196 yards. Hubbard rushed for 106 yards to lift his season total to 1,832 — tops in the country — and Oklahoma State (8-3, 5-3 Big 12) won its fourth straight game.</p>
      <p>Jarret Doege, who made his first start for West Virginia in last week’s upset win at Kansas State, was 28 of 38 for 307 yards and a touchdown. The Mountaineers (4-7, 2-6) were eliminated from bowl eligibility.</p>
      <p>No. 22 Iowa State 41, Kansas 31</p>
      <p>Sophomore quarterback Brock Purdy passed for 372 yards and four touchdowns while rushing for another score as the Cyclones survived six lead changes to beat the Jayhawks in Ames, Iowa.</p>
      <p>Purdy, who completed 29 of 42 passes, set Iowa State single-season records for passing yardage, total offense, completions and touchdown passes in the final home game for the Cyclones (7-4, 5-3 Big 12). Iowa State went ahead for keeps with a 5-yard touchdown rush by Purdy with 5:10 remaining.</p>
      <p>Kansas (3-8, 1-7) then threw four straight incomplete passes after quarterback Carter Stanley had seemingly found his rhythm with three touchdown strikes in the second half as part of a 328-yard performance.</p>
      <p>No. 23 USC 53, UCLA 35</p>
      <p>Kedon Slovis passed for a single-game school-record 515 yards, and his four touchdown throws powered the Trojans past the rival Bruins at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.</p>
      <p>Slovis completed 37 of 47 attempts against UCLA (4-7, 4-4) and bested Matt Barkley’s 493-yard effort against Arizona in 2012. He also broke Sam Darnold’s freshman season record with 3,242 passing yards.</p>
      <p>Four receivers surpassed 100 yards in the same game for the first time in USC history: Drake London caught eight passes for 142 yards and one touchdown; Amon-Ra St. Brown had eight for 128 yards; Tyler Vaughns finished with 106 yards on six catches; and Michael Pittman Jr. caught 13 passes for 104 yards and a pair of touchdowns.</p>
      <p>No. 24 Appalachian State 35, Texas State 13</p>
      <p>Darrynton Evans rushed for three touchdowns, and the Mountaineers took over in the second half to defeat the visiting Bobcats at rainy Kidd Brewer Stadium in Boone, N.C.</p>
      <p>Later in the day, Arkansas State beat Georgia Southern, allowing Appalachian State (10-1, 6-1 Sun Belt) to clinch the Sun Belt East Division and a berth in the conference championship game on Dec. 7. The Mountaineers reached the 10-win mark for the second season in a row, this time doing so under first-year coach Eliah Drinkwitz.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Zac Thomas threw for two touchdowns for the Mountaineers, who led only 14-13 in the third quarter before Evans began a stretch of three touchdown runs to end the scoring.</p>
      <p>Navy 35, No. 25 SMU 28</p>
      <p>Quarterback Malcolm Perry ran for 195 yards and two touchdowns on 38 carries to lead the host Midshipmen past the Mustangs in Annapolis, Md.</p>
      <p>Navy (8-2, 6-1 American Athletic Conference) enters its conference finale at Houston tied for first in the West division with Memphis, which has the tiebreaker but must play East-leading Cincinnati next week.</p>
      <p>Perry scored on a 70-yard touchdown run with 6:11 remaining for what turned out to be the game-winning touchdown. SMU (9-2, 5-2) then drove down to the Navy 12-yard line but was stopped on fourth-and-4 with 2:36 remaining when Shane Buechele threw an incomplete pass. Navy ran out the clock from there.</p>
