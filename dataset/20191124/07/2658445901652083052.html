      <p>Liverpool continued a seemingly relentless push for their first league title since 1990 after a late goal by Roberto Firmino gave them a scrappy 2-1 win at Crystal Palace on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The result extended Liverpool’s unbeaten Premier League run to 30 games stretching back to last season as they stayed top of the table, eight points ahead of closest rivals Leicester City who were 2-0 winners at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.</p>
      <p>Firmino struck from close range in the 85th minute, shortly after Wilfried Zaha cancelled out Sadio Mane’s opener for the visitors who had looked toothless in the first half with Mohamed Salah on the bench nursing a sore ankle.</p>
      <p>Although Liverpool were far from impressive, they ground out yet another late win as the Merseyside club again demonstrated the kind of resilience they have often lacked in previous campaigns.</p>
      <p>Jordan Ayew and Gary Cahill missed chances for Palace before the home side had a 43rd-minute effort ruled out by VAR, the replay showing Ayew had pushed Dejan Lovren before James Tomkins headed the ball in at the far post.</p>
      <p>The visitors looked sharper immediately after the break, with Mane firing wide before he netted a 49th-minute goal with a scrambled shot which goalkeeper Vicente Guaita got a hand to but could not keep out.</p>
