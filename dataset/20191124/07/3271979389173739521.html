      <p><b>Justin Timberlake</b> was spotted holding hands with actress <b>Alisha Wainwright</b> at a bar in New Orleans on Saturday, leading to allegations he might be cheating on wife <b>Jessica Biel</b>. Despite the speculation, sources close to the situation tell <b>Gossip Cop</b> there’s “nothing happening here.” The two are currently working together on the drama <i>Palmer</i>, and were joined by several members of the cast and crew during their outing.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, photos and videos spread online which show Timberlake enjoying drinks with a group of people on a balcony overlooking Bourbon Street. At one point in the footage, Wainwright can be seen resting her hand on Timberlake’s knee. The two also appear to be very briefly touching hands at another point. The footage went viral, resulting in a firestorm of speculation on social media, as well as straight-up accusations of Timberlake cheating on his wife. He’s been married to Biel since 2012, and the two share a 4-year-old son together.</p>
      <p>An individual close to Timberlake exclusively tells <b>Gossip Cop</b> there’s “nothing happening” when it comes to any speculation about the singer having some sort of fling with his co-star. We’re assured they were out with a group of other people working on <i>Palmer</i>, in which Timberlake stars as an ex-convict who becomes the caretaker of a boy abandoned by his mother. Sources involved in the production of the film also tell us that several members of the cast and crew went to the bar for drinks during their downtime from the shoot. Timberlake and Wainwright didn’t hit the town alone, and we’re assured they’re just friends and colleagues.</p>
      <p>It should be noted, Timberlake appears to be slightly inebriated in the footage. If the singer is guilty of anything, it was having a bit too much to drink on Saturday. In fact, it appears that Wainwright was simply a bit concerned about his well-being, which is why she placed her hand on his knee. Towards the end of the video, an unidentified woman can be seen helping Timberlake up from his chair and leading him out of the bar.</p>
      <p>At this point, Wainwright stays behind and continues chatting with the other people in their group. The full video of the interaction has gotten much less attention than some of the still shots of Wainwright touching Timberlake’s hand and knee. The full video, however, paints a more accurate depiction of what transpired. It appears the singer just drank a bit too much and was told he should call it a night. Wainwright continued her night after Timberlake went home. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can confirm there’s nothing to see here.</p>
