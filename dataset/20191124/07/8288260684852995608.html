      <h1>'Long way' - Here's how Ahmed Hegazi played on his West Brom comeback</h1>
      <h2>Jaquob Crooke reports on the Egyptian defender's first start of the season in Albion's win over Sheffield Wednesday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jaquob Crooke</a></address>
      <p>West Bromwich Albion’s 2-1 victory over Sheffield Wednesday seen Ahmed Hegazi make his much-anticipated return to the starting eleven.</p>
      <p>Albion’s accomplishments this season are made all the greater when you consider they have been without their stalwart defender, and it had been hoped that the return of Hegazi would help to aid Slaven Bilic’s side pursuit of clean sheets.</p>
      <p>However, it was evident that there is still a long way to go before the Egyptian’s back at his resilient best, with the defender looking fairly rusty upon his return to first-team action.</p>
      <p>And Hegazi didn’t exactly make a composed start to proceedings.</p>

      <p>His centre-back partner Kyle Bartley presented a difficult situation for Hegazi to contend with as he allowed a high ball to go over his head to where Hegazi was positioned, but the Egyptian was flat footed in his approach and poor judgement enabled Jacob Murphy to nick the ball off him.</p>
      <p>Hegazi was fortunate that Murphy’s pull-back was overhit as Steven Fletcher stretched out a leg at the back post, but the Baggies were able to recover and Hegazi’s blushes were spared.</p>
      <p>As the game progressed Hegazi soon settled, providing a composed outlet in possession for West Brom when playing out from the back.</p>

      <p>Hegazi was present in the penalty area for all of Albion’s set-pieces, although the defender’s aerial threat wasn’t utilised in the opening period with a string of poor deliveries.</p>
      <p>With that being said, Hegazi had lost his marker Julian Borner on several occasions, with his opposite number providing a hands-on test for Hegazi to negotiate.</p>
      <p>However, Hegazi’s lack of match sharpness crept into the fore once again when a breakdown in communication between himself and Filip Krovinovic let the ball slip through for Fletcher, however Bartley was there to thwart a Wednesday counter.</p>
      <p>Hegazi was once again found in no man’s land as half-time approached, being pulled out of position by Fletcher before failing to make his tackle stick and that enabled Kieran Lee to work some space before Conor Townsend cleared.</p>

      <p>The 28-year-old returned for the second-half offering a more reassured performance than at the end of the first-half.</p>
      <p>The visitors started the second period strongly and Hegazi’s positioning was vital to breaking down Sheffield’s attack, and the centre-back was confident in neutralising the threat of Lee when Wednesday countered down Albion’s left.</p>
      <p>Then the most hair-raising moment of the game occurred in the 63rd minute, and it was all of Hegazi’s own doing.</p>
      <p>The Egyptian was hapless in possession and gifted the ball to Sheffield substitute Adam Reach in a dangerous area, and just as the midfielder looked to play in Fletcher who was free in the box, Hegazi got a vital toe to deflect the ball away before racing across to block Reach’s low strike.</p>
      <p>The presence of Wednesday striker Fletcher had given Hegazi a constant headache and his battle with the forward was summarised when Fletcher drifted off his shoulder before being picked out by Bannan, and then lifted the ball over Hegazi and rifling a volley over the crossbar.</p>
      <p>Hegazi was left in a tangle but the referee’s whistle had spared the Egyptian’s blushes, adjudging Fletcher to have handled the ball in the build-up.</p>
      <p>And in the 74th minute, Hegazi’s afternoon came to a premature conclusion as he was substituted, with Bilic opting to bring on Gareth Barry and drop Semi Ajayi into the centre-half role.</p>
      <p>A mixed afternoon for Hegazi, who gained some vital minutes under his belt.</p>
      <p>However, it’s clear to see he is still some way off the pace and with Romaine Sawyers and Jake Livermore returning to the fold for midweek, it seems unlikely that he will retain his place in the starting XI.</p>
