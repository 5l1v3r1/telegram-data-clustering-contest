      <p>Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia has accused the National Democratic Congress (NDC) of seeking  to fuel tribalism and propaganda with claims the Volta Region roads have been ignored in the 2020 budget</p>
      <p>He noted that their argument that the Volta Region had been ignored by the Akufo-Addo administration with regards to the construction of critical roads is flawed and far from the reality.</p>
      <p>“If only they took their time to read the budget! But they don’t like reading. They like propaganda. They like to knock our heads against each other. They like tribalism. They like division. Under Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo this country is going to be governed as a united country. No region will be overlooked. That is why we have policies like one constituency one ambulance, one district one factory, one district one warehouse, one village one dam, water for all, toilets for all, and free SHS for all, to ensure inclusion of all”.</p>
      <p>Dr Bawumia revealed that even before the 2020 Budget was read in Parliament, contractors for the Hohoe-Jasikan and Jasikan-Dodo Pepsi roads  had already  mobilised  to site,  stressing that the NDC were  merely engaged in propaganda  when they  accused government  of deliberately ignoring  the  Volta Region  with  regards  to the construction  of ‘critical ‘ roads.</p>
      <p>The Vice President made this known when he cut sod for the construction of the Eastern Corridor Hohoe-Jasikan and Jessika-Dodo Pepsi roads recently.</p>
      <p>The Vice President laughed off claims by NDC legislators and party activists that the Volta region has been overlooked in the 2020 Budget statement.</p>
      <p>“When the budget was read, even though in the budget you could see mention of roads in many regions and in the Volta region the dualisation of the Ho town roads, construction of Ho bypass, Dufor-Adidome road, Asutsuare-Aveyime road, upgrading of Klefe town roads, Akatsi town roads, Ketu South area roads, upgrading of selected Kpando Municipality roads and Ketu North roads. All of these were in the budget. But after the Budget we were being told that we have ignored Volta region”, he disclosed.</p>
