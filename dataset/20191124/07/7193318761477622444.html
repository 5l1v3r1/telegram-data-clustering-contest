      <p>If you like reading about history, criminals or westerns, Jerry Thompson's new nonfiction book may be ideal for you.</p>
      <p>"Wrecked Lives and Lost Souls: Joe Lynch Davis and the Last of the Oklahoma Outlaws" is the latest release from the University of Oklahoma Press. It examines the life of Thompson's grandfather, which Thompson brought to life through "sleuthing into his family's past" and doing meticulous research, according to a news release.</p>
      <p>"Growing up ... Thompson knew only that his grandfather was a gritty, 'mixed-blood' Cherokee cowboy. ... That was all anyone cared to say about the man," the release states. "But after Thompson's mother died, the award-winning historian discovered a shoebox full of letters that held the key to a long-lost family history of passion, violence, and despair."</p>
      <p>Turns out that Davis, Thompson's grandfather, was a central figure in any number of crimes, including "systematic cattle rustling, feuding, gun battles, a bloody range war, bank robberies, and train heists in early 1900s Indian Territory and Oklahoma."</p>
      <p>The box of letters was a starting point for unraveling Davis' story. But Thompson also brought "painstaking detective work" to bear, hunting down archival records, digging up newspaper accounts and court proceedings and interviewing whoever he could. His efforts exposed not only Davis' life, but also the lives of his cadre of "long-forgotten ... outlaws" whose crimes rivaled those of the unforgettable Younger gang. The book also chronicles "the dark path of a Cherokee diaspora from Georgia to Indian Territory."</p>
      <p>Thompson teaches history at Texas A&amp;M University and has authored many books on Texas history and the American southwest, including "Cortina: Defending the Mexican Name in Texas."</p>
