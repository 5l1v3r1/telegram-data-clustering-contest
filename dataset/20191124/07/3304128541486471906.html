      <p>Michael Olunga was on fire, scoring a whopping seven goals as Kashiwa Reysol humbled Kyato Sanga 13-1 in the Japanese second division league on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Harambee Stars forward finished the season with 26 goals, two less than Brazilian Leonardo Nascimento of Niigata.</p>
      <p>Kashiwa ended the season first, a year after being relegated, confirming their topflight status next season.</p>

      <p>Olunga has enjoyed a fine form in his second season at Kashiwa and was the main man in front of goal. The former Gor Mahia playerâ€™s future at the club is however doubtful.</p>
      <p>According to grapevine, Olunga could end up in Bundesliga next season.</p>
