      <h2>The Strictly Come Dancing judge, 59, on the truth behind the glitz, getting gooey over her new love, how her mum is often by her side and teaching Tom Cruise to dance</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>The Shirley we’re used to seeing on  <i>Strictly</i>  is warm, smiley and a good-time girl. She seems absolutely lovely and down-to-earth, doesn’t she?</p>
      <p>That’s why, when we met her a couple of years back and she was frosty and slightly spiky, we were surprised. So when Shirley invites us to her home for a chat, it feels a bit like entering a lion’s den.</p>
      <p>But when she asks us, ‘Do I seem different to the last time you met me?’ we get the impression that even  <i>she’s</i>  shocked by how far she’s come.</p>
      <p>Because the woman who greets us is a dream.</p>
      <p>She  <i>is </i> warm and smiley and an absolute good-time girl, laughing loudly and telling us the stories behind the photographs that line the wall of her kitchen, which, of course, has subtle sequins and a fully stocked bar leading into the living room.</p>

      <p>This happiness (which is literally beaming out of her, the term ‘glowing’ doesn’t cut it) could be down to her boyfriend <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/danny-taylor">Danny Taylor</a> .</p>
      <p>The pair met doing panto last year and became an item in March, leaving her as giddy as a school girl (her phone background is a zoomed-in picture of his face) and sparking rumours he might just become her husband number three.</p>
      <p>Also close to Shirls' heart is her son Mark, a professional dancer, and her beloved mum, Audrey, 82, who spends almost every waking hour with her daughter, lovingly helping with her washing and ironing.</p>
      <p>In fact, mother dearest is ironing Shirley’s knickers in front of us and serving us coffee in cute teddy bear mugs, while Shirley sits in leggings and a jumper, curled up on a chair for our chat. </p>
      <p>A new man, good health (Shirley had her breast implants removed a few weeks ago after a health scare), a third year on the glitziest show on the telly nearly done and dusted… The future is looking sparkly.</p>

        <b>The Strictly final is almost here…</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, and what an electric atmosphere in the build-up. I’ve loved working with Motsi, she’s fitted in seamlessly.</p>
      <p>I’ve known her years, I used to judge her in competitions when she was a little girl.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You seem to have a great relationship…</b>
      </p>
      <p>We have the same sense of humour and we stay in touch off-screen, so it isn’t just like we’re friends at work.</p>
      <p>I’m glad she’s been herself, that’s what makes her unique.</p>
      <p>
        <b>We’re anticipating some full-scale glamour from you for the big night…</b>
      </p>
      <p>The glam isn’t my favourite part. I’ve worn 40 dresses by the time the series ends. But luckily I have a stylist to dress me, or else I’d walk out in a pair of hot pants.</p>
      <p>Then I have enough make-up for 50 faces, all that’s missing is a blow torch to blast my wrinkles.</p>

      <p>
        <b>We think you always look very elegant.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Well, this series I’ve been more natural. My son and boyfriend said sometimes I can look a bit dated – slightly Dynasty.</p>
      <p>So they suggested less is more and I look less plastic.</p>
      <p>
        <b>So your boyfriend’s opinion is valued?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hugely! He’s so handsome, have you seen him?! My son is the worst critic, then my mum.</p>
      <p>I call her every Saturday at 5pm in my outfit for the night and she has no problem telling me if she hates my dress. Danny is softer in his approach.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You seem besotted with Danny…</b>
      </p>
      <p>Oh my goodness yes, can we talk about him, please? How many hours have you got?</p>
      <p>He’s lovely, he’s 47 next birthday. He’s not a toy boy! People keep saying that and I think it’s sexist.</p>
      <p>He’s nearer 50 than 40, so my mum quite rightly says.</p>
      <p>
        <b>It seems as though you met at the perfect time.</b>
      </p>
      <p>I hadn’t dated for six years when I met him. My choice, not because I wasn't asked.</p>
      <p>Then I opened my mind and it’s been a whirlwind, I haven’t put my feet on the ground.</p>
      <p>Mum, what do you love most about Danny?</p>

      <p><b>Mum:</b> (Now ironing his pants) His bum.</p>
      <p><b>Shirley:</b> He does have a cute bum! He was in a best bottom competition once and he won.</p>
      <p>Well deserved. That’s why Mum likes ironing his pants, so she can get close to it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You seem to be in such a happy place…</b>
      </p>
      <p>The happiest I have ever been. I didn’t go out at all before I met Danny.</p>
      <p>Only to the garden centre at weekends with my mum. But now I have a social circle and we do date night.</p>
      <p>Totally new for me to do that. He insists on quality time together under no pressure. Is he too good to be true?</p>

      <p>
        <b>So wedding bells must be on the horizon?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mother, buy a hat! I think he’s the one. I’d say yes if he asked me.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How does he find the celebrity side of your life?</b>
      </p>
      <p>He’s not interested. He works in theatre. When we met on panto he genuinely thought he was in a show with Shirley Bassey.</p>
      <p>But in Liverpool it’s him who gets stopped and me who’s the chopped liver. He’s so well known there for his theatre that people walk towards us and I think, ‘Oh, here we go,’ and they ask me to take a picture of them with Danny.</p>
      <p>I’m stood there thinking, ‘Er, and a picture with me too maybe?’</p>

      <p>
        <b>You like being recognised?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m just used to it. I don’t wear much make-up now I am with Danny.</p>
      <p>But if we’re out for the evening I’ll make an effort. When I was married to my second husband he liked a full face of make-up, so I’d sleep in a full done-up look.</p>
      <p>It was something he liked. The first time Danny stayed over he was peeling off my eyelashes and wiping my face and said, ‘There she is.’</p>
      <p>I thought that was very sweet, as I felt quite naked without make-up in the past. He likes it more casual.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What have you learnt about yourself being with him?</b>
      </p>
      <p>That it’s OK to be just me. I don’t always have to be on point. I don’t feel anxious any more, as he calms me.</p>
      <p>That’s the opposite to anything I’ve had before, so it’s been quite revealing. I don’t have to be dolled up 24/7.</p>
      <p>My ex-husband had a thing where I couldn’t get into bed if my toe polish was chipped. It’s nice that I don’t have to do that.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Has your son met Danny?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, and we FaceTime him a lot. He think’s he’s a really nice guy. Which is good because my son and I couldn’t get any closer.</p>
      <p>He’s a real mummy’s boy.</p>

      <p>
        <b>What are your best and worst qualities?</b>
      </p>
      <p>My mum says I’m forgiving. She can’t believe what I forgive sometimes, but I think that means I have a real human element.</p>
      <p>The worst is I’m too hard on myself. I never feel like I’m good enough, slim enough, or pretty enough.</p>
      <p>People compliment you in this business and I couldn’t handle it at first. I’d never experienced it before, definitely not when I was married to either husband!</p>
      <p>
        <b>How do you handle reading negative comments online?</b>
      </p>
      <p>My mum tells me not to read anything, she’s very no-nonsense, but it can be tricky.</p>
      <p>I mean, I’m 59, I wasn’t raised with a father, and the 1960s wasn’t an era where people were overly complimentary or tactile.</p>
      <p>My mum didn’t tell me I was great all the time. If she came to watch me dance and I was sh*t, she’d tell me.</p>
      <p>I think that served me well. But even now if I sulk she’ll say, ‘Well, don’t ask for my opinion.’</p>

      <p>
        <b>You seem quite sensitive?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m quite shy, to be honest. You need an alter ego in this business.</p>
      <p>I won’t even change in front of people on set. But on the floor as a dancer, I’m different. You can put it on.</p>
      <p>You’ll never make it if you’re a Debbie Downer. When my brother took his own life in 2003, I had to go back to work shortly after.</p>
      <p>My mum told me to leave the problem at the door and you pick it up at the way out. And she’s right.</p>
      <p>You need ‘take no prisoner’ qualities.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you have a diva side?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I was raised in the north, I have a mother who never gave me a chance to have a diva moment because she’d slap me.</p>
      <p>If she thinks I sound above my station she will pull me down a peg or two.</p>
      <p>Humans need a cuddle and love. We’re all the same.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Have you ever been starstruck?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Oh yes, me and mum love that programme with Paul O’Grady and the dogs, so I was frozen when I met him.</p>
      <p>I also taught Tom Cruise how to dance before he took his wife out once.</p>
      <p>My feet could barely move, but I taught him the salsa.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Everything seems pretty good right now, what could top it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I try to wake up every day and pat myself on the back. As a single woman at 57, to get a job on Strictly was brilliant.</p>
      <p>But I want it all. Hot air balloons, skydives, learn how to fly…</p>
      <p>There’s no slowing down, we’re go, go go!</p>
