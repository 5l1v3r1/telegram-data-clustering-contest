      <p>There was chaos at a Hwange hospital when a se_x starved man accused his sick wife of overstaying in hospital and attempted to kidnap her so that they could be intimate.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.sundaynews.co.zw/hwange-man-abducts-sick-wife-demands-sex/">Sunday News</a>, Tinos Muzamba (23) of Bhangali Village, the s_ex starved man,  was peeved that his sick wife had been away from home for long and accused her of overstaying in the hospital. He lashed out at her accusing her of being insensitive to his conjugal needs as he had been unable to have se_x since she was admitted in the hospital. It was not disclosed what the wife was suffering from or how long she had been admitted in hospital.</p>
      <p>The medical personnel at St Patrick’s Hospital tried to reason with Muzamba but it was to no avail as he tried to discharge his wife himself. Muzamba was so incensed that he had to be forcibly restrained and subdued by security personnel at the hospital.</p>
      <p>But even after being subdued he started shouting out threats and obscenities at his wife telling her that he would murder her when she returned home. He accused her of listening to the doctors while ignoring his wishes.</p>
      <p>Muzamba was charged with Domestic Violence Act (physical abuse) for threatening his wife with death. When he appeared before Hwange provincial magistrate Mr Gift Ntando Dube last week, Muzamba readily pleaded guilty to the charge.  In mitigation, he claimed that he was se_x starved.  Magistrate Dube remanded  Muzamba in custody awaiting sentencing.</p>
      <p>Muzamba is also facing 17 counts of unlawful entry and theft.  The magistrate said that those matters will go trial after his current trial is done.</p>
