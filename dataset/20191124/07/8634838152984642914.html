        <b>A heartbroken father emotionally recounted the demise of his sons on Friday night, November 22 in the landslide that left a death trail in West Pokot County.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As first reported by<i> The Standard</i>, <b>Chemuruto Yopokapel</b>, one of the survivors of the unfortunate event disclosed losing his three sons.</p>
      <p>In desperation, Yopokapel, ran and fell several times as stones hit and injured him in a bid to rescue his sons who were sleeping in one bed.</p>

      <p>"I scampered to save lives to save the lives of my family but I could not get back inside the house to save the three boys aged 6, 8 and 10," the father disclosed.</p>
      <p>He eventually gave up as his efforts became futile. His wife and two daughters who sustained several injuries, however, managed to escape. The three boys were recovered strapped together.</p>
      <p>The devasted father has since had his fingers crossed with the hope that he would be reunited with the surviving members of his family.</p>
      <p>"I'm here stranded. My house has also been flattened and my animals swept away. I fear staying in this place, it is dangerous, I am willing to be relocated," he added.</p>
      <p>The massive landslide resulted in the death of 37 people. The incident occurred between Friday night and the wee hours of Saturday, as it was raining heavily and was also too dark.</p>
      <p>In a statement sent to newsrooms, President <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46751-uhuru-takes-action-after-deadly-landslide"><b>Uhuru Kenyatta</b> stated that he had directed the deployment </a>of resources including rescue personnel from our various security and humanitarian agencies, among them the Kenya Defence Forces, the National Police Service and Special Programmes to the affected region.</p>
      <p>The team would help provide mitigative action against further loss of lives. </p>
