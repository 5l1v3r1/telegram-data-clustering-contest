      <p>Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng says it's a shame that inequality in South Africa has become "sharper" during a constitutional democracy.</p>
      <p>Delivering the 17th annual Nelson Mandela Lecture at the University of Johannesburg's Soweto campus on Saturday, Mogoeng said: "It really is a shame that 25 years down the line we still have so much of our people suffering as they do."</p>
      <p>"It is a shame that inequality has become sharper during constitutional democracy. We need unity now more than before," Mogoeng said in his keynote address.Â </p>

      <p>He spoke under the theme: "Constitutionalism as a tool for transformation."</p>
      <p>"We will be betraying the legacy of Madiba if we don't give practical expression to the injustices of our past."</p>
      <p>He also said each citizen had the responsibility to build the country and that people should not waste time polarising society.</p>
      <p>"Let's confront and expose any institution and anybody who practices discrimination."</p>

      <p>The chief justice said most of the country's problems were a direct consequence of colonialism and apartheid.</p>
      <p>"Anybody who says don't blame anything on colonialism and apartheid is being mischievous. Most of the problems we have to deal with right now are a consequence of colonialism and apartheid. It's critical that we never stop talking about it. What we cannot do is blame it all on colonialism and apartheid.</p>
      <p>"It is therefore absolutely necessary that we never stop talking about colonialism...and apartheid."</p>
      <p>Mogoeng called on South Africans to unite, adding that "unity is essential for what Madiba calls 'the vision enshrined in the Constitution'."</p>
