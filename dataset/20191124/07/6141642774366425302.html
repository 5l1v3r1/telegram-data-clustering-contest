      <p>Producer and director Arthur Marks, who helmed many episodes of the Perry Mason TV series and produced several hit blaxploitation films, died aged 92.</p>
      <p>Marks died on November 13 at his home in Woodland Hills, California, his son Paul said.</p>
      <p>“My brother and I learned everything about the film industry from my father,” said Paul Marks, who is a TV producer.</p>
      <p>“He was a pillar of the industry.</p>
      <p>“He taught us the morals of the industry and how to treat people.”</p>
      <p>Arthur Marks’ grandparents and parents worked in the film business, and he grew up in it.</p>
      <p>Marks was the director and producer of 80 episodes of Perry Mason.</p>
      <p>He also directed episodes of the TV shows I Spy, Mannix and The Dukes Of Hazzard.</p>

      <p>They include Detroit 9000, which was re-released in cinemas in 1998 by Quentin Tarantino, and two films starring actress Pam Grier: Friday Foster and Bucktown.</p>
      <p>“I believe when you put in the mix; a good script, a terrific cast, an experienced and perceptive director and a professional production what is the result?</p>
      <p>“A film that audiences will enjoy and play eight weeks in a downtown theatre in Chicago, Detroit or Kansas City,” Marks said.</p>
      <p>“My intention was never to sell my films as a ‘black’ film, rather a film that will damn well entertain for 120 minutes…with excitement, passion and a heart moving story.”</p>
      <p>In addition to his son Paul, Marks is survived by another son, Beau; two daughters, Kathleen and Elizabeth; six grandchildren; and five great grandchildren.</p>
