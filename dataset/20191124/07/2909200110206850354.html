      <p>The opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) feels embarrassed by the artistic impression roads it claimed to have constructed in the infamous Green Book which turned out to be otherwise in reality, Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia has observed.</p>
      <p>“Contrary to all the nice pictures in the Green Book, we realised that the reality on the ground was very different. For eight years of the previous NDC government, they did not pay much attention to Volta or Oti roads. For eight years. But today they want to tell us they care more about Volta and Oti than we (NPP) do. Eight years. They accomplished very little”, he revealed at sod cutting ceremony.</p>
      <p>He said “the NDC, I’m sure they are very embarrassed by their record. Very embarrassed, because it is an embarrassing record, if the truth is to be told. They claimed they had fixed so many roads in the country, but today there are demonstrations everywhere across all the regions for more and more roads. In their eight years they didn’t fix one major road in Upper East region. Not one. In their eight years in office, not one major road in Upper West region did they complete. Not one. So should these regions also say you have ignored them completely, wouldn’t they be justified?”</p>
      <p>According to him, upon the assumption of the current administration, government promised to focus on roads which is a major cry of the citizens promising the current government is determined to pursue it to the latter.</p>
      <p>“We identified these roads more than two years ago and said we were going to do these roads. And the Minister for Finance in the budget mentioned specifically that we are going to do Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu road. And this is what we are seeing today. We are seeing that Hohoe-Jasikan is being done as we speak today, and Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu is being done.</p>
      <p>What is very interesting, and what the country should know is that, through the efforts of the Minister for Roads, Hon Kwesi Amoako Atta, the contractors for Hohoe-Jasikan and Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu were mobilised and on site two weeks before the budget statement of Hon Ken Ofori-Atta. Two weeks before the budget they had already mobilised to site. So how can you ignore a region by mobilising for the construction of their roads”, he quizzed.</p>
      <p>Responding to the recent claims by section of the NDC that roads in the Volta Region had been captured in the 2020 budget, he said “Another point. Of all the roads that were listed under critical roads in the budget, the only roads that have started are the Hohoe-Jasikan and Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu. They are the only two. All the others that have been listed are still under procurement. So how can you even think that we have ignored Volta region when it is the one that is starting, before anybody else “Eight years, you didn’t fix the Volta region roads. You didn’t fix the Oti roads. And I can go on and on.” ?”</p>
