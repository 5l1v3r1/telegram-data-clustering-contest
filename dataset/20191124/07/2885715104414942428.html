      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:03:06+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Actor Vidyut Jammwal says he is happy people recognise him as Commando and believes acceptance from the audience is the best thing an outsider like him can ask for.</p>
      <p>Vidyut established himself as the next generation action hero with 2013 action drama Commando, which grew to become a franchise. The second installment came in 2017 and now he is gearing up for the third chapter, to be released on November 29.</p>
      <p>The actor, who made his debut with 2011 Telugu film Shakti, entered Bollywood the same year — as an antagonist in Force, featuring <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/john-abraham/">John Abraham</a> in the lead.</p>
      <p>“Commando was my first film as a hero and I have been fortunate my character received so much love from the audience. It’s rare for an actor’s first film to go on to become a franchise. Even today when I step out, I am referred to as Commando by people. That is special to me,” Vidyut, 38, told PTI in an interview.</p>
      <p>He has since straddled Telugu, Tamil and Hindi films, including Baadshaho and Junglee.</p>
      <p>“For an outsider, the most important thing is that the audience should love you. I have worked very hard and I am glad the audience has got me back to the theatres. I feel blessed there are people who watch my films, love and respect me, feel inspired by me.”</p>
      <p>In the first Commando film, Vidyut’s title character, Karan Singh Dogra fought for love, while in the second one, his fight was against corruption and black money.</p>
      <p>The latest installment is about saving the country.</p>
      <p>“There is <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/intel/">intel</a> that an attack is being planned that will cause huge devastation and the task at hand is to stop and neutralise the threat,” the actor said.</p>
      <p>Post Commando 3, Vidyut will be seen in Khuda Hafiz, which is based on true events.</p>
