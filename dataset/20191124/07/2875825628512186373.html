      <h2>Former World’s Strongest Man Eddie Hall on his stomach-churning diet eating 8,000 calories a day, teenage panic attacks – and driving himself to hospital with an agonising training injury</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Everyone has an image of what the World’s Strongest Man looks like, and former champion Eddie ‘The Beast’ Hall is the epitome of super sized.</p>
      <p>At 6ft 3in and weighing 28 stone, maintaining his physique is a full-time job. And it starts from the second he wakes up.</p>
      <p>‘On average I eat 8,000 calories a day,’ smiles Eddie. ‘I have two breakfasts.</p>
      <p>'A full English at first – four slices of bacon, four sausages, black pudding, eggs, fried bread, beans, the works.</p>
      <p>'Then a second breakfast of porridge and about five portions of fruit.</p>
      <p>'I snack all day on cashew nuts and beef jerky and lunch will be steak or chicken with rice, pasta and veggies and half a family-sized cheesecake for pudding.</p>
      <p>'Then I have a steak and rice meal then the evenings get hefty. Spaghetti bolognese or a curry and the other half of that cheesecake to polish it off.’</p>

      <p>To many, that would seem an obscene amount of food, but with the three hours in the gym Eddie commits to each day, it’s the bare minimum he needs to fuel his impressive frame.</p>
      <p>‘I get my vitamins in and make sure I cover all the food groups,’ he says seriously.</p>
      <p>‘I see a nutritionist and have a good mix of protein, carbs and fats, but to power a body my size in training, I can more or less eat what I like.</p>
      <p>'My wife is brilliant and does most of the cooking. She has to cook separately for herself and the kids, and cooking these extra meals for me is constant.</p>
      <p>'At the times where I’ve been training really hard, our food bill was £300 a week. And that’s just for me. The other family supplies were on top of that,’ he explains.</p>
      <p>But it’s quite a process for someone to go on to be crowned the strongest man in the entire world.</p>
      <p>For hundreds of years, crowds have marvelled in wonder at watching men lift, pull and throw their way to the ‘world’s strongest’ title.</p>
      <p>Early accounts of the event include reports of men lifting elephants, pulling planes and as the movement increased in popularity, due to icons such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, it opened it up to a mainstream audience.</p>

      <p>Little Eddie was just five when he realised he had a flair for fitness.</p>
      <p>‘My mum was a swimming teacher and I have two older brothers – anyone with siblings knows that it makes you competitive,’ he laughs.</p>
      <p>‘I had to be faster than them in the pool and by the time I was 10 I won the national championships and had broken records. But unfortunately my life took a turn after that.</p>
      <p>'I went into a depression following anxiety attacks. I was thrown off the swimming squad, I got a girl pregnant and my nan was diagnosed with cancer. My world came crashing down.</p>
      <p>'I hardly left the house for two years until one day my parents suggested joining a gym. I never looked back.’</p>
      <p>Slowly, Eddie, now 31, started to love his time in the gym. Surrounded by men his own age, he felt a rush of endorphins when he finished a training session, hugely helping with his mental health issues.</p>
      <p>‘The euphoric feeling the gym gave me became addictive,’ he explains.</p>
      <p>‘When I was 19 I’d built up such a huge strength and the stronger I became, the more the demons stayed at bay.</p>

        <figcaption>He was a swimming champion when he was younger, winning a chestful of medals</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>'I started posting videos of my progress on YouTube and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> and realised I was one of the strongest men in the country.</p>
      <p>'I said on that day, “I’m going to win the World’s Strongest Man,” and 10 years later to the day, I achieved it.’</p>
      <p>With a love of weight training and sheer determination, Eddie won the UK’s strongest man every year between 2011 and 2017, and then went on to achieve the highly coveted world title in 2017, the first win for the UK in 24 years.</p>
      <p>But being a beast for a living has its challenges. ‘I’ve broken a few sofas in my time,’ he laughs sheepishly.</p>
      <p>‘I plonk myself down on my friends’ sofas and often they split straight down the middle. I have a custom-made, heavy-duty bed at home, but I’ve broken my fair share of hotel beds, too.’</p>
      <p>Transport is another issue that’s tricky to navigate. ‘It’s a real nightmare to be honest,’ Eddie says.</p>
      <p>‘It has to be first class on trains, business class on planes – I don’t fit in an economy seat. I drive the largest car I could get in the UK, a Ford Ranger pick-up. Even that’s a squeeze,’ he adds.</p>

        <figcaption>As soon as he put his mind to it, Eddie was determined to become World's Strongest Man</figcaption>

      <p>Another inevitable issue with maintaining a strongman body are the health risks. Having being criticised for his size, Eddie has to agree with their concerns.</p>
      <p>‘It is unhealthy when you’re at the very top level of strongman,’ he says. ‘To be the best in the world you push your body to absolute limits.</p>
      <p>'I was 32 stone when I won it. The NHS would say that’s one of the most morbidly obese men who’s ever lived. But it’s muscle weight.</p>
      <p>'I see doctors regularly and have tests and, touch wood, I haven’t had a scare yet. But marathon runners die, footballers drop dead, any sports come with a risk.’</p>
      <p>Another risk of extreme weight lifting (Eddie broke the world record by lifting 500kg, or 79 stone, in a deadlift then passed out) are inevitable injuries.</p>
      <p>But Eddie seems to brush off injuries that would make any other grown adult cry like a baby.</p>
      <p>‘I piled a load of heavy weights on a leg-press machine and then heard a loud thud. It had come crashing down and the weights had landed on my penis. I nearly bled to death,’ he says.</p>
      <p>‘It was bad. The worst ever. I didn’t cry for help though. I just lifted them off, drove myself to hospital and got stitched up. I was back training soon enough.’</p>

      <p>Becoming a massive name in the strongman world, Eddie is now famous across the globe and has masses of fans, something he and his family have managed to adapt to seamlessly.</p>
      <p>‘The kids fully get it. It wasn’t overnight fame so they had time to get used to it. They know if they pop into Tesco with their dad it won’t take 10 minutes, it’ll take an hour,’ he smiles.</p>
      <p>‘But we take it in our stride. Even on my honeymoon in Mauritius I was recognised everywhere.</p>
      <p>'Fans always want to arm-wrestle or for me to pick them up! But I totally embrace it. I even train in a public gym because I like the atmosphere.</p>
      <p>'Of course people want pictures, but I shun my home gym to get in there and train with everyone else.’</p>
      <p>Eddie has also gained a few celebrity fans, and unsurprisingly, a few want his help when it comes to hitting the gym.</p>
      <p>‘Paddy McGuinness comes and trains with me when he can. I have to train a different body part each day for three hours to stay on-brand, plus four hours of cardio on top,’ he says.</p>
      <p>‘But Paddy has transformed his physique. He’s been a bit chubby in the past but he’s solid now, fair play to the guy.’</p>

      <p>Eddie is also surprised by how many celebrities know who he is.</p>
      <p>‘I’m always amazed when I go on game shows and all these big stars want pictures! But for me, it’s Arnie himself being a fan that blows my mind.</p>
      <p>'He comes to watch me and cheers me on and he mentions me in his speeches. I had the opportunity to train with him and we had breakfast.</p>
      <p>'Five-year-old Eddie Hall would be so excited right now. He was my hero growing up,’ he smiles.</p>
      <p>Aside from knowing Mr Schwarzenegger on a personal level, Eddie has now had a chance to work with him to inspire others, just as Arnie inspired Eddie as a young boy.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve been able to produce a documentary with Arnold all about mental health, which is out soon. It’s hard to follow in his footsteps, but I’ve achieved so many goals that it’s now great to work with him and speak out.</p>
      <p>'He’s got me out of some dark places, if I can do that for someone else, that would be great.’</p>
      <p>And the sky is the limit for Mr Hall, who plans on grabbing every single opportunity that comes his way.</p>
      <p>‘I’m starring in a Hollywood film which is so exciting!</p>
      <p>'I did the reality show Celebs In Solitary, which was absolutely awful, but I’d love to do Strictly and I’m A Celebrity. Watch this space!’</p>

      </figure>
      <p>He also has two small children to keep him busy and he admits, ‘Yes, their friends love coming over for playtime and being picked up!’</p>
      <p>He certainly wouldn’t mind them carrying on his legacy one day.</p>
      <p>‘If my kids wanted to do it I’d love to help them. Even my daughter could do strongwoman.</p>
      <p>'It’s a sport which is growing and I’d support them whatever they wanted to do. If I could turn my little lad into the world’s strongest man, I’d love to.</p>
      <p>'He has the tools, I have the knowledge. But for now they have it good. In the age-old argument of, “My dad’s bigger than your dad,” they win every time!’</p>
