      <p>The deceased was in prison as a result of theft charges but has several previous convictions, including robbery, possession of a knife and burglary.</p>
      <p>A prison spokesman said: "Shortly after midnight, gardai and emergency services were called by prison authorities following an incident involving two male prisoners in custody at the prison.</p>
      <p>"A man in his late 30s was treated by emergency services but was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later."</p>
      <p>The Coroner has been notified and the services of the State Pathologist and Garda Technical Bureau have been requested."</p>
      <p>In a statement, the IPS said all practicable measures were taken by prison management and staff to ensure the safety of those in custody.</p>
      <p>But it added that no prison system could be entirely free of violence and it said that assaults between prisoners did happen.</p>
