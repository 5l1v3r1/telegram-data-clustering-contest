      <p>Jason Derulo has denied photoshopping his pants <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/need-wash-eyes-soap-seeing-jason-derulos-nsfw-photo-anaconda-11200092/">after a rather NSFW snap sent fans wild</a> this week.</p>
      <p>The singer, 30, shared a photo of his recent trip to Bali with fans… but the only thing people noticed about the shot was the blatant ‘d**k print’ in the photo.</p>
      <p>Jason shared the photo of him wearing the world’s tiniest and tightest pair of black swimming trunks (or possibly boxers, we’ve been too scared to zoom in too close) as he stood on the edge of an infinity pool.</p>
      <p>Of course, fans were quick to comment on the racy photo, asking what he had in his pants… to which Jason replied that it was an ‘anaconda’.</p>

      <p>After fans assumed he’d gone a little ham on the editing tools, Jason has denied he altered the photo.</p>

      <p>It’s au natural, baby.</p>
      <p>‘It was in Bali. I honestly [didn’t] feel like that was going to be my most liked picture when I woke up this morning,’ he<a href="https://www.tmz.com/videos/112219-jason-derulo-4680686-0-eltd04lw/"> laughed to TMZ</a> over the weekend.</p>
      <p>‘I posted the mother*cker very early. It was [a photo] from months ago. It was not even something that I just did.’</p>
      <p>When asked about photoshop, he said: ‘Photoshop? Photoshop? Don’t make me [pull it out].</p>
      <p>‘There’s not enough women in this area. Just know that us Haitians, we look different.’</p>
      <p>It’s been a big couple weeks for the star, who recently reacted to criticism of the ‘creepy’ Cats trailer, in which he stars as Rum Tum Tugger.</p>
      <p>He told Confidential: ‘I don’t think I have ever seen such a polarising reaction from any other trailer ever.</p>
      <p>‘I knew that was what it would be from the jump and that is what I hoped it would be because that is what I felt like was the magic of the stage play.</p>
      <p>‘It is unlike anything that you’ve ever seen before so everything that has been said about it being creepy or left and weird, it is all of that and more.’</p>
