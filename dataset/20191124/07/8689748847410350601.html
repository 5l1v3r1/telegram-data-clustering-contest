      <h1>Bhim fans attack M.anifest for teaming up with Kelvynboy to diss Stonebwoy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:34:21+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/staff/" target="_blank">Nana Yaw</a></address>
      <p>If you want to feature an artist on a diss song, look no further, M.anifest is the one to go for since his records speak so well for him.</p>
      <p>The Ghanaian rapper seems to have carved a niche for himself after helping Strongman throw shots at Medikal <a href="https://www.ghbase.com/during-my-beef-with-medikal-several-people-called-to-give-me-dirty-secrets-of-fella-makafui-so-i-could-use-but-i-refused-strongman/">during their lyrical beef some months ago.</a></p>
      <p>In the recent development, m.anifest also known as God MC has teamed up with Kelvynboy to release a diss song directed at Stonebwoy and social media users have already waded into the beef sharing their view on the diss song, ‘Yawa No Dey’.</p>
      <p>The lyrical content of the song taking into critical thinking seems to have been recorded with Stonebwoy in mind.</p>
      <p>Well, whatever and however you may take it, social media have come to the conclusion that Manifest has now become a “lawyer of beef” who is hired by artistes to bring down the hard-earned reputation of other artistes into disrepute.</p>
      <p>Commenting on M.anifest’s post after he uploaded the link to the song on Facebook, many users took him for teaming with Kelvynboy to diss Stonebwoy.</p>
