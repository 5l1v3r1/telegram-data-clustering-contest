        <b>After having left Barcelona for Zenit Saint Petersburg earlier this summer, Brazilian winger Malcom has hinted that he may return to the La Liga defending champions next summer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a recent interview with <i>RMC Sport</i>, Malcom revealed that he has been getting messages from Barcelona fans, asking him to return to the Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>“I can say that I receive messages about returning to Barcelona,” he said, before adding:</p>
      <p>“Every time the coach gave me an opportunity to play, I did my job and I think I did it well. That’s why Barcelona fans love me.”</p>
      <p>The former Bordeaux star created quite a lot of controversy ahead of the 2018-19 season, as he initially agreed to join AS Roma – and just before the deal was agreed to by both Bordeaux and the Serie A side, Barcelona hijacked him and took him to Spain.</p>
      <p>He then made the move to Zenit St. Petersburg ahead of the ongoing 2019-20 season, after making 24 appearances and scoring four goals for the Catalans across various competitions.</p>
      <p>Malcom also made it clear that he does not regret the fact that he had to leave the <i>Blaugrana</i>.</p>
      <p>“No, I don’t regret it,” he said, before adding:</p>
      <p>“I’m young and I want to play anywhere, because I like football. Zenit are the team who gave me the opportunity to play football, so I don’t regret it.”</p>
