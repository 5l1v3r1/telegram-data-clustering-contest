        <b>Cody Simpson has shared a sweet tribute to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/miley-cyrus/">Miley Cyrus</a> on her birthday, days after Elsa Pataky said ex-husband Liam Hemsworth ‘deserved better’.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Miley’s boyfriend Cody posted a message to his lady on her 27th birthday over the weekend, thanking her for ‘being herself’.</p>
      <p>The pair have been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> for a short while, following Miley’s September split with Hunger Games actor Liam.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Cody, 22, had a sweet message for the Mother’s Daughter singer when, alongside a cute video, he wrote: ‘Happy birthday baby. Thanks for being you (sic)’.</p>
      <p>Cody wasn’t the only one sharing birthday shout outs to Miley as her father Billy Ray Cyrus also had a sweet message for the star, writing: ‘Happy Birthday @mileycyrus!!! Love you so much (sic)’.</p>

      <p>So much love.</p>
      <p>It seems Miley and Cody are full steam ahead after it was previously claimed that Miley has a ‘very easy’ relationship with the Australian singer and swimmer.</p>
      <p>An<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/miley-cyrus-cody-simpsons-relationship-dubbed-easy-split-rumours-11204887/"> insider told People:</a> ‘Miley and Cody have their separate lives. Cody had to stay in LA but has visited Miley in Tennessee. They have a very easy relationship. They see each other when they can, and when they are apart, things are good too. This works for both of them…</p>
      <p>‘They are very happy together. She has a new house in LA and when she’s in town, she has been spending most nights there. She was out of town and they definitely missed each other. They reunited and you could see how happy they were to be back together again. I</p>
      <p>‘t’s clear they are very into each other. She has a busy schedule and a lot of work commitments that have kept them apart. But when they are together there’s no doubt they are crazy about each other.’</p>
      <p>The Wrecking Ball hitmaker apparently values the ‘freedom’ she gets in her relationship with Cody.</p>
      <p>It comes after her former sister-in-law Elsa – who is married to Chris Hemsworth –<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/liam-hemsworth-heads-elsa-patakys-comments-deserves-better-miley-cyrus-11207181/"> spoke about her support for Liam</a> in the wake of his marriage split.</p>
      <p>She said at a press conference in Madrid this week: ‘My brother-in-law, well… after a relationship that you’ve dedicated 10 years to, he’s a little bit down, but he’s coping well.</p>

      <p>‘He’s a strong boy and he deserves the best. I think he deserves much better.’</p>
      <p>Speaking about the support Liam received from his big brother Chris after escaping back to Australia following the split, Elsa added: ‘You always find support in your family, and he’s joined at the hip with [Chris], who has been there to give all the strength he needed.’</p>
