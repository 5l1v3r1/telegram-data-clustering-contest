      <p>A showcase of research and opportunities for Irish food and beverage producers took place in the Teagasc Food Research Centre, Moorepark, Fermoy, Co. Cork, on Thursday, November 21.</p>
      <p>The Teagasc Gateways event titled: ‘Food Biotransformation – Biological Processes for Sustainable and Novel Food Development’ aimed to provide an opportunity for food and beverage producers, to find out about national and international activity in the area.</p>
      <p>According to a statement from Teagasc, the event offered attendees the opportunity to engage with experts, see demonstrations of technologies and service platforms available within Teagasc and obtain information on innovative supports from National Development Agencies.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The programme for the Teagasc Gateways event included presentations by national and international experts, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prof. Lene Lange, retired Technical University of Denmark;</li>

      <p>Commenting on the event, Teagasc food researcher Kieran Kilcawley said: ”Food biotransformation is receiving renewed interest because it is seen as a more natural process, more consumer and legislation friendly, can potentially add value to food-waste streams and can offer a more sustainable alternative to other production processes.”</p>

      <p>The edition describes the current technologies, capabilities, services and expertise available.</p>
