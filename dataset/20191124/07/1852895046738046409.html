      <h1>Will Ferrell Reunites With Maya Rudolph In Hilarious Pocahontas Themed Skit On ‘SNL’</h1>

      <h4>Former ‘SNL’ cast members Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen returned to Studio 8H for the epic reunion that took us back to the 1600s — and reminded us no one can digest corn.</h4>
      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/will-ferrell/"><b>Will Ferrell</b></a>, 52, returned to the <i>Saturday Night Live </i>stage for his fifth time as host and he didn’t disappoint! Just in time for Thanksgiving, Will took us back to the first-ever dinner in 1621 and played the hilarious role of Pocahontas’ grandfather — and we aren’t talking about the Disney version. <b>Maya Rudolph</b> and <b>Fred Armisen</b> returned to the stage to reunite with the <i>Anchorman</i> actor, and the trio had the most hilarious moment of the night — right down to Fred and Will’s near-perfect wigs!</p>
      <p>In the skit, 12-year-old Pocahontas brings home her 30-year-old boyfriend John Smith for the first time, introducing him to her parents played perfectly by Maya and Fred. Grandpa Will is immediately suspicious of the “pale faced” John Smith — played by <b>Beck Bennett</b> — who he accuses of stealing buffalos, land, and “those blankets that are getting everybody sick” — wait, what? “Who told you the blankets are getting people sick?” Maya asked, as Will quickly interjected, “The Fox” — a not-so-subtle jab at Fox News! “He knows what’s up…since when is it our job to take care of this world’s problems?”</p>
      <p>Beck’s John then returns to the table after running to the bathroom multiple times, with a little too much TMI for a family dinner. “I think my stomach is having a hard time digesting this food — I saw some whole kern kernels in my stool and I specifically remember chewing them all.” It turns out he wasn’t alone, as Fred’s character exclaimed “yeah, that happens to me too!”</p>

      <p>Breaking the fourth wall, Will then addressed the audience directly. “If you’re anything like me, you know there’s a lot of problems in this crazy, crazy sketch,” he began. “I mean, white actors playing Natives, what is this — 2014? But no matter what year it is, or what color we are — whether we get our news from a fox or a peacock — one thing is for sure: none of us can digest corn.” Perhaps that’s the PSA we all needed before Thanksgiving dinner!</p>
      <p>Fans had plenty to say about the not-so-politically correct skit on Twitter, and their comments were on point. “@SNL is hysterical tonight. Will Ferrell is so freakin’ funny, and that Thanksgiving sketch was simply brilliant!” <a href="https://twitter.com/C_Heckart/status/1198483315516305408">@C_Heckart</a> tweeted, while <a href="https://twitter.com/kylie_zach/status/1198494921260298240">@kylie_zach</a> posted “Fred Armisen and Maya Rudolph’s friendship is so cute!! #SNL.” <a href="https://twitter.com/hercAICN/status/1198494471362531329">@hercAICN</a> added “The Thanksgiving sketch with Maya &amp; Armisen killed too, as did the teen party and the pizza commercial. A truly, truly great #SNL. Good luck topping that, <b>Eddie Murphy</b>!!!!” referencing Eddie’s upcoming hosting gig on Dec. 21.</p>
      <p>Maya was previously a full-time cast member on <i>SNL </i>from 2000-2007, while Fred was on the series from 2002-2013 — and the pair currently co-star on the Amazon series <i>Forever</i>. Tonight was a milestone for Will — who was a full-time cast member on <i>SNL </i>from 1995 until 2002 — as he joined the coveted five-timers club! The elite group, which refers to those who have hosted the show five times, also includes actors <b>Tom Hanks</b>, <b>Justin Timberlake</b>, and <b>Jonah Hill</b>, to name a few. The <i>Elf </i>actor <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/28/snl-will-ferrell-opening-monologue-blood-head-wound/">last appeared</a> on the popular NBC series on Jan. 27, 2018.</p>
