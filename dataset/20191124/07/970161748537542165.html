      <p>Finally the campmates were reunited on Saturday night’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…Get Me Out Of Here – although they all had to do a rather gruesome trial so that they could be together again.</p>
      <p>However, it was it was all worth it because after the bushtucker trial, the campers won 12 stars for the camp – so at least they didn’t go hungry.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> did gag on a cow’s eye and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> Roberts had to eat a cow’s anus (yummy) in the process of it.</p>
      <p>Things were also getting a bit too much for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> and Andrew Maxwell as they both shed a tear over missing family.</p>
      <p>The camp also received their luxury items – and it’s safe to say we love Cliff even more now.</p>
      <p>So if you missed Saturday night’s show don’t panic as we have picked out the best bits.</p>

      <h3>Cliff Parisi’s luxury item was the thing best ever</h3>
      <p>The Call The Midwife actor decided to bring a bit of festive cheer to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/im-celebritys-cliff-parisi-brings-christmas-tree-luxury-item-fans-absolutely-loving-11207662/">jungle in the form of a Christmas tree (and I didn’t think we could love him anymore).</a></p>
      <p>Camp Leader <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-haskell/">James Haskell</a> and his deputy <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> entered the camp bearing gifts – or at least the remaining luxury items that had yet to be won.</p>
      <p>He and Jacqueline handed them out to the delighted celebrities who sat around the camp stove.</p>
      <p>Cliff was given his oddly shaped present and he said ‘This is something I think we might all enjoy a little bit’ as he unwrapped a Christmas tree to cheers from the other campmates.</p>
      <p>As Caitlyn Jenner was handed her she exclaimed how she couldn’t sleep with a dry face explaining her choice of luxury face cream.</p>

      <p>Roman had a mug with a picture of his girlfriend and dog on it. Nadine had a tangle teaser for her hair.</p>
      <p>Ian explained that his luxury item ‘wasn’t physical’</p>
      <p>Music started to play in the Jungle clearing and Ian explained that his luxury item was his favourite track – Kirk Franklin’s Looking For You, which he could have played three times.</p>
      <p>All the campmates danced around the camp stove with joy at hearing music for the first time for ten days.</p>
      <p>Andy chose lip balm, Myles had a disposable camera, Andrew had an inflatable chair, Jacqueline had a pillow with family photos on and James had a memory foam neck support pillow.</p>

      <p>Fans swiftly took to Twitter to share their love towards Minty.</p>
      <h3>They brought back the ‘hold in mouth trial’</h3>
      <p>The main camp and the jungle jailhouse camp came together to take part in a rather gruesome-sounding trial – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/im-celebrity-use-live-bugs-bushtucker-trial-stars-hold-spiders-mouths-despite-controversial-ban-11206966/">and they had to hold live bugs in their mouths for 60 seconds</a> (rather them than us).</p>
      <p>One group of campmates had to endure the ‘critter drop’ where they had a selection of creepy crawlies poured all over them.</p>
      <p>The other group had to take part in the ‘hold in mouth trial’.</p>

      <p>‘They are going to take a hold in mouth trial where they have to hold different critters in their mouth for 60 seconds,’ Kate explained to Adam Thomas ahead of the trial.</p>
      <p>‘And there’s going to be lots of horrible ones like the Huntsman spider.</p>
      <p>‘The trial will end with them eating a cow’s anus and a cow’s eye.’</p>
      <p>Ahead of the show, it was reported that producers<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/im-a-celebrity-bosses-ban-live-insects-from-bushtucker-trials-after-animal-rights-backlash-11165998/"> banned the use of live insects on the programme.</a></p>
      <h3>Caitlyn Jenner gagged on a cow’s eye</h3>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/im-a-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-gags-on-cows-eye-in-gruesome-bushtucker-trial-11207520/">After the bushtucker trial, Ant and Dec told the celebs that they would then pick names out of the hat –</a> and if they were picked they would have to eat a jungle delicacy.</p>
      <p>First up was James and Caitlyn who each had to eat a cow’s eye.</p>
      <p>James chomped through his with ease earning another star and releasing Myles.</p>

      <p>The next two celebrities had to eat a cow’s anus – and poor Adele Roberts and Nadine Coyle had to do it.</p>
      <p>Nadine and Adele were picked with the pop star going first. She chewed and retched but got it down and Adele asked everyone to sing to encourage her and again ate the cow’s anus meaning between them the campmates won 12 out of 12 stars.</p>
      <h3>Other highlights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>James Haskell was voted as the team leader – and had to divide up the camp chores.</li>
        <li>Myles and Nadine cooked dinner which was wallaby hind, naploes, daikon, sugar beet leaves, yellow chanterelles and casimiroa for dessert.</li>
      </ul>
