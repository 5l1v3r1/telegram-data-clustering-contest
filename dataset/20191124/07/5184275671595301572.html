      <p>Recently, the actor shared pictures of her first test look from the movie on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Pooja shared the picture with the caption, “Throwback to my first look test for #Housefull4 in my period look as Rajkumari Mala?? Just took out my phone and took some pictures in the dressing room to see how it was looking… what say?”</p>
      <p>She also wrote, “I wanted to keep the make-up extremely minimal for #RajkumariMala as I wanted her to just look fresh, innocent and true to that time… Often it can get very challenging to maintain the same brief as it’s very easy to get carried away when u do a commercial film like Housefull 4. So glad that people loved the look and appreciated it.”</p>
