      <h1>Man Utd clash will show Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder how far he's come</h1>
      <h2>After hanging up his boots aged 33 due to injury, Wilder spent three days working on a building site - now he's managing the Premier League's surprise package</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:46:41+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:46</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Bates, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/steve-bates/</a></address>
      <p>Every time Chris Wilder drives past Meadowhall on the outskirts of Sheffield he can’t help picking out one particular house that links his past to his ­present.</p>
      <p>Almost 20 years ago, as he struggled with life after playing football, Wilder spent three days putting a roof on, as he laboured on a building site.</p>
      <p>“It’s a permanent reminder of what my life could have been like after finishing playing,” said the Sheffield United boss.</p>
      <p>“That’s why every day I’m just so grateful I’m still earning a living out of football at 52.</p>
      <p>“It’s all I’ve ever known, apart from those three days on a site in Sheffield.</p>

      <p>“I’d finished my playing career at Halifax through injury and came out of game at 33 not ­knowing what the future held.</p>
      <p>“I got a job on a building site and I was carrying roof trusses up a ladder at Meadowhall.</p>
      <p>“It was in January and it was freezing cold. I was wearing gloves and the other guys on site were looking at me and I knew what they were thinking.</p>
      <p>“I just thought ‘this isn’t for me’. Football is all I’ve ever known.</p>

      <p>“I still drive past that house regularly and I always look for it. I can’t believe the roof is still on to be honest!”</p>
      <p>Just how far Wilder has come from those uncertain days will be clear today as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> ­arrive at Bramhall Lane... sitting below the Blades in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>But Wilder’s fans aren’t confined to the Steel City – with Harry Redknapp even suggesting the Blades boss should have been in the frame for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> before they appointed Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>That makes Wilder chuckle – but he appreciates the support from men like England manager Gareth Southgate, Sir Alex Ferguson, Sam ­Allardyce and Redknapp, as the ­no-nonsense ­Yorkshireman flies the flag for home grown Premier League ­managers.</p>

      <p>“For me and for the ­players it’s been a great start to the ­season and the ­exposure that this league gets globally is like no other ­division in football.</p>
      <p>“So when you are doing okay and ­surprising a few ­people winning a few games you get the limelight – but it’s just ­important to keep your feet on the ground.</p>
      <p>“That’s always been my way of working and nothing will change. I just keep my head down and ­always have done. Wherever the pathway takes you it will happen.</p>
      <p>“I don’t look too far ahead of myself and neither do my ­players and staff.”</p>

      <p>That attitude has helped the Blades ruffle some big feathers already – but even if Manchester ­United’s plume is not in its finest shape ever, Wilder remains wary of today’s visitors.</p>
      <p>“We are in good nick, good form, but we know we have to play well and respect United. We won’t be ­awestruck but my lads won’t agree that we are favourites either.</p>
      <p>“It’s still Manchester United whether or not they are in ­transition and have injuries. Against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> recently we didn’t want to be ­standing back admiring their ­players because we believe we’re a good team and the opposition have to play well to beat us.</p>
      <p>“Liverpool and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> both beat us, but when I was having a beer afterwards with their ­managers they knew we’d made them work for it.</p>
      <p>“If Ole and his United team play well and get a result I want to make sure they’ve had to work hard for it. That’s our thought process on everything.”</p>
      <p>Wilder will seek out Ferguson after the game and perhaps share a glass with him.</p>
      <p>“I know Alex and Sir Bobby Charlton are coming over and I’ll try to get a word with Alex if I can.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t like losing and ­neither do I – so we’ll see!”</p>
