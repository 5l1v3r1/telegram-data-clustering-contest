      <h1>(Video) van Dijk’s highlights from Palace further proof that he’s the best in the world</h1>

      <p>Virgil van Dijk put in a monstrous performance as Liverpool claimed all three points in a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace over the weekend.</p>
      <p>It was a testing affair, as they say – no game in the Premier League is easy, and it could have very easily been a draw, if not for the intervention of VAR.</p>
      <p>But that would be discrediting a lot of the work van Dijk did throughout the game, as the big centre half willed on a defiant performance from the Reds.</p>
