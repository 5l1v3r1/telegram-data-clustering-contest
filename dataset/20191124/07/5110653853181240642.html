      <p>The NBA fined Los Angeles Lakers guard Rajon Rondo $35,000 one day after he was ejected from a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>
      <p>Rondo paid the price for "unsportsmanlike physical contact" on Thunder guard Dennis Schroder in LA's 130-127 win Friday in Oklahoma City.</p>
      <p>The Lakers veteran was assessed a Flagrant 2 foul and ejected in the fourth quarter at Chesapeake Energy Arena.</p>

      <p>Rondo appeared to kick Schroder, with the NBA also penalizing the former on Saturday for "verbal abuse of a game official and failing to leave the court in a timely manner upon his ejection."</p>
      <p>Rondo is averaging 7.2 points, 2.8 rebounds and 5.6 assists this season.</p>
