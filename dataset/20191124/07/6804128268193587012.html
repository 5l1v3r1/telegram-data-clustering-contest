      <h1>Bellerin, Torreira - Latest Arsenal injury news and return dates ahead of Eintracht Frankfurt</h1>
      <h2>The latest injury news as Arsenal take on Southampton after the international break</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:42:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:42</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal drew 2-2 with struggling Southampton at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday to heap further misery on Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>The result leaves the Gunners seventh in the table, 12 points adrift of the top four.</p>
      <p>The poor form has caused unrest among supporters, with many calling for a managerial change to be made at the club, ahead of the trip to Norwich next weekend.</p>
      <p>Take a look at the latest injury news from the Emirates below:</p>
      <h3>Dani Ceballos</h3>
      <p>The midfielder was substituted early in the second half of the Europa League clash against Vitoria before the international break with an injury problem.</p>
      <p>Ceballos pulled up with what looked like a hamstring problem while closing down an opponent and was replaced by Matteo Guendouzi in the 54th minute, despite appearing to want to continue.</p>
      <p>The Spanish international missed both the trip to Leicester and his country's games over the international break, and Arsenal have revealed that the midfielder could be out of action for a bit longer yet.</p>
      <p>An update claimed that Ceballos will "return to training in mid-December", meaning that the midfielder could miss as many as the five next Arsenal matches.</p>
      <h3>Joe Willock</h3>
      <p>The young midfielder has already made 15 appearances for the Gunners this season.</p>
      <p>And his form has earned England recognition in the form of the Under-21s as well.</p>
      <p>Willock was in action during the international break, starting the 3-0 win over Albania last week.</p>
      <p>He was substituted after 64 minutes though, with his Arsenal team-mate Reiss Nelson coming on and scoring the third in a 3-0 win.</p>
      <p>There was no indication that the substitution was injury related, although the 20-year-old was not picked to start the follow-up clash with the Netherlands on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>His return to fitness was rubber stamped when he was named in the squad for the Southampton clash and came off the bench.</p>
      <h3>Kieran Tierney</h3>
      <p>Kieran Tierney was not called up for international duty with Scotland, for whom he would have got some playing time given Andy Robertson's injury.</p>
      <p>Steve Clarke left him out of the squad for the Euro 2020 qualifiers against Cyprus and Kazakhstan, but that is not because Tierney has suffered a setback in his recovery from injury.</p>
      <p>Instead, Arsenal requested that he did not feature as part of a pre-planned recovery programme to get him back up to speed quicker.</p>
      <p>And Tierney was named in the starting line-up against Southampton.</p>

      <h3>Sead Kolasinac</h3>
      <p>The Bosnian returned from international action last week with a tight left hamstring and was only named on the bench against Southampton.</p>
      <h3>Granit Xhaka</h3>
      <p>The Arsenal midfielder was left out of the squad against Southampton, but it is understood the Swiss midfielder was not injured.</p>
      <h3>Emile Smith Rowe</h3>
      <p>It's been an injury-hit season for the attacking midfielder thus far and he suffered a setback prior to the Europa League tie against Vitoria and was left out of the travelling squad.</p>

      <p><b>football.london</b> reported this was simply a precaution due to a tight calf muscle and that the injury is not a serious problem.</p>
      <p>The teenager wasn't named in the squad to face Southampton, but is back to full fitness and should be in contention for the Eintracht Frankfurt clash on Thursday.</p>
      <p><b>Hector Bellerin</b> and <b>Lucas Torreira</b> were both substituted against Southampton, but it understood both changes were tactical decisions by Unai Emery.</p>
