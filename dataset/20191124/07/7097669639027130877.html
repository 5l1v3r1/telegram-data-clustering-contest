      <h1>State of Emergency: Why Chile Is Facing a Crisis</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T07:36:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 07:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Alexis Javier Apablaza Campos</a></address>
      <p>After a month of sometimes deadly demonstrations against inequality, <a href="https://www.trtworld.com/americas/chile-president-to-lift-state-of-emergency-at-midnight-protests-continue-30880">Chile may be making its way toward peace</a>.</p>
      <p>A coalition of parties from across the political spectrum says it will support a <a href="https://time.com/5730814/next-chile-protests/">constitutional referendum next year</a> to decide whether and how Chile’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/15/chile-referendum-new-constitution-protests">1980 Constitution should be changed</a> in response to protester demands.</p>

      <p>Chile’s protest movement, which killed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/11/06/world/americas/06reuters-chile-protests.html">about 23 people</a>, according to the attorney general’s office, began on Oct. 18, 2019 with mass fare evasions on the Santiago Metro after an increase of 30 Chilean pesos – about US$0.04 – on the price of rush hour tickets.</p>
      <p>On that day, which ended with <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/chile-president-seeks-cross-party-help-end-street-violence-2849385">20 subway stations and more than 15 buses set aflame</a> across the capital, President Sebastián Piñera made his first crisis-time speech to the Chilean people: He decreed a state of emergency in Santiago.</p>
      <p>Over the next week, Piñera would make a series of speeches aimed – unsuccessfully, it turns out – at quelling the crisis.</p>
      <p>
        <b>All the president’s speeches</b>
      </p>
      <p>Demonstrations, looting and fires occurred in various cities after the transit uprising in Santiago, resulting in <a href="https://www.efe.com/efe/english/portada/curfew-imposed-in-several-chilean-cities-amid-unrest-3-killed-fire/50000260-4091045">curfews being declared</a> across the country on Oct. 19. Chile’s Armed Forces took to the streets to try to restore order and to prevent – during certain hours – free movement through the streets.</p>
