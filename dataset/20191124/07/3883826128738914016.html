        <b>Captain Leon Smith says Great Britain can be excited about their chances of future success in the Davis Cup despite a heartbreaking semi-final defeat by a Rafael Nadal-inspired Spain in Madrid.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Doubles pair Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski lost the deciding rubber to Nadal and Feliciano Lopez in a 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (10-8) defeat.</p>
      <p>It clinched a 2-1 win for hosts Spain, who play Canada in Sunday's final.</p>
      <p>"I look forward to a really positive 2020," Smith said.</p>

      <p>Britain's five-man team of Andy Murray, Dan Evans, Kyle Edmund, Jamie Murray and Skupski reached the last four of the inaugural season-ending finals, which are the brainchild of Barcelona footballer Gerard Pique, to ensure an automatic spot in next year's event.</p>
      <p>Edmund, 24, was the star player for Britain, winning all three of his singles rubbers in straight sets, despite a disappointing ATP season where he has slipped to 69th in the world.</p>
      <p>Andy Murray, 32, missed the last three matches after struggling for fitness during a sluggish three-set win over world number 179 Tallon Griekspoor in the opening victory over the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Evans, who won one of his four singles matches, is ranked as the British number one, while Jamie Murray and Skupski are continuing to improve as regular doubles partner.</p>
      <p>Smith also pointed to Cameron Norrie and doubles player Joe Salisbury - Britain's sole representative at the recent ATP Finals - to illustrate the depth at his disposal.</p>
      <p>"Everyone's got their different journey to go on, but I think we should be excited by what we have in British tennis," said Smith, whose side also beat Kazakhstan and Germany.</p>
      <p>"We've got so many different things going. I think it's great, it's positive.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully everyone can just keep on that path and we come back here next year with an even stronger team than the strong team we have already got."</p>

      <p>Jamie Murray and Skupski, who had an impressive week on his Davis Cup debut, could not convert any of four second-set points against world singles number one Nadal, 32, and 38-year-old Lopez in Saturday's semi-final.</p>
      <p>The Spanish pair, roared on by a boisterous home crowd in the Caja Magica, swung the momentum back in their favour and converted a second match point to leave the British contingent devastated.</p>
      <p>"The emotion is still raw," Smith told BBC Sport.</p>
      <p>"You're within a couple of points of going into a deciding third set and then it's game on. There was nothing in it. I'm proud of all of them.</p>
      <p>"We're hurting, but we've seen an amazing tie here against Spain, who are arguably the strongest team in the competition, especially with Rafa in it.</p>
      <p>"We've pushed them within a couple of points to a deciding set to see who goes into the final.</p>
      <p>"To reach semi-finals is a brilliant achievement, we have come through tough matches and tough moments.</p>
      <p>"Everyone has stepped up and we'll look back proudly on this."</p>
