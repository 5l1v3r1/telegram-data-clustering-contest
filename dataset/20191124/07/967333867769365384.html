        <b>A young man in Australia claiming to be a Chinese spy was reported earlier on Saturday to have applied for political asylum in Australia and gave authorities details about the espionage operations he was allegedly involved in.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shanghai Police claimed on Saturday that the alleged Chinese spy Wang "William" Liqiang, who is now hiding in Sydney on a tourist visa, is a convicted fraudster, according to the BBC.</p>
      <p>The Chinese police reportedly said that Wang Liqiang, 26, is from the eastern province of Fujian and had been <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201901211071660762-washington-subway-chinese-contract-letter/">sent to prison in 2016 over fraud</a> cases.</p>
      <p>Liqiang, who was reported to have provided the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) with information about operations in Australia along with Hong Kong and Taiwan, claims that he has been<a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201811051069530512-Fearing-Chinese-Spying-US-Institution-Scientists/"> involved and personally participated</a> in a number of “espionage activities”.</p>
      <blockquote>Treasurer of Australia Josh Frydenberg said that Wang Liqiang’s accusations are "very disturbing" and his case has been passed to the relevant law enforcement agencies, according to the BBC.</blockquote>
      <p>The alleged Chinese spy reportedly handed a 17-page statement to Australian authorities in October, although his allegations only appeared in the media on Saturday. The statement reportedly <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201810291069333111-Chinese-Spy-Plane-South-Korean-Airspace/">contains the details on how the alleged espionage</a> operations were carried out and has named senior Chinese intelligence officials who run these operations.</p>
