      <p>It is the annual question that plagues working families as temperatures rise and Christmas looms: what to do with the kids?</p>
      <p>The so-called school holiday conundrum reflects the disparity between WA school children’s entitlement to about 12 weeks a year and the four weeks of paid leave on offer to the average full-time working parent.</p>
      <p>The rise of double working parent households has exacerbated the problem, which comes to a head every year in the summer holidays.</p>
      <p>On paper the summer break — the longest of the year — is only about six weeks but any harried parent knows that a quirk in the space-time continuum can make them feel endless.</p>
      <p>Many families scramble to secure spots in vacation care programs, some of which can run to $100 a day and operate with hours that make a full day in the office impossible.</p>
      <p>Others hire nannies to cover at least a few weeks of the break. Organisations such as Nanny Share Perth, which offers to match families to share the cost, can help make it more viable, if not exactly cheap.</p>
      <p>Frequently, grandparents are drafted in for short or long-term stints for those fortunate to have them nearby. And for those with family interstate or overseas it is not unheard of for the children to be sent away for a summer holiday.</p>
      <p>Depending on the whims of employers, many mums and dads will also work from home, take unpaid leave or both.</p>
      <p>For most families the solution is a messy combination of all of the above, which requires a good memory, strategic reminder texts to all involved parties and a carefully-curated calendar.</p>
      <p>It also costs money, whether paying for caregivers or missing out on work, and anecdotally is more likely to involve mothers re-jigging their lives or working hours.</p>
      <p>Tania Cecconi is an experienced juggler when it comes to school holidays and her eight-year-old daughter. The Gender Equity chief executive has had a mixed experience with vacation care: some was expensive, some only ran from 11am and 3pm and some had questionable value, where they “run the kids ragged” with “no real skills development and no free play”.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know how families with three or four (children) do it,” she said. “I think we have created a model of work that hasn’t changed since post-industrial revolution.”</p>
      <p>Her solution this year will involve her daughter’s father, grandparents and some flexible working hours.</p>
      <p>Roxanne Elliott is the co-founder of Careforkids.com.au — a website that aims to connect parents with childcare providers. She and her husband Mark started the business out of frustration with the struggle to find childcare for their daughter Nina, now 19. For parents with children in private schools, she said, holidays could add up to about three months a year.</p>
      <p>“We were running a different business at that time so it was quite a shock and, you know, child care was incredibly difficult to find so we ended up doing a tag team situation whereby we had a couple of days in the office each and tagged with Nina, our daughter, working from home so that’s how we managed it,” she said.</p>
      <p>She said the trend was for sessional care or occasional care and grandparents as care-providers were “definitely a big one because obviously it’s very cost effective”.</p>
      <p>Yokine couple Katrina and Todd Gannon have been sending their children to day care since they were seven-months-old. With both parents working full-time, Mrs Gannon said she always wanted a family but wouldn’t give up her career.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a plan in place, so hubby starts work early and I finish later, so he picks up the kids. We’ve got the kids in day care — on the days they’re not in school — for the full day, then they’ve got before-school care. Then next year after-school care as well,” she said.</p>
      <p>“My role (at work) I look after quite a large team, so I have 125 reports and I love my career as well, so I’m happy I can maintain my career and have a family at the same time.”</p>
      <p>Mr Gannon said their family needed a double income, and while they rely on their parents sometimes, day care was their only option.</p>
      <p>“Everything is expensive nowadays, your mortgage, rates, bills, putting food on the table. Nowadays if you want to live in a half-decent suburb, you’ve got to have two incomes in to be able to afford it, and before and after school care definitely helps us out because without it, I don’t know what we’d do,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Our kids go to see their nanna and pop once a week on a Tuesday, and that saves us money as well, the day care fees and everything like that.”</p>
      <p>Joy Robustellini, from Tuart Hill Baby and Child Care said the pressure parents are under during school holidays has increased over the years.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been in the industry for 23 years, I’ve found that it’s actually becoming more stressful. I’m finding that parents are finding it more difficult to have extra time off because of their financial commitments, so they stick to the four-weeks more,” she said.</p>
      <p>For the Gannons, day care hasn’t just helped them stay at work during school holidays, Mrs Gannon said her kids enjoy it.</p>
      <p>“Going to this day care has been a second family for us, They’ve watched our kids grow up. I highly recommend kids going to day care, because the transition for our kids going to day care, then going to school was much easier for them,” she said.</p>
      <p>“They had that socialisation, and watching them learn and develop, I mean, there’s lots that we can teach them at home, but they pick up so much from learning around other kids.”</p>
      <p>South Yunderup mother Carrie Griffin, who juggles running her fitness business with raising three children with husband Sam, said this summer break would be the first since her mother died a month ago.</p>
      <p>“My mum used to help us, so we never had to worry about it before,” she said. “But now we have no one.”</p>
      <p>She said she would bring her children, Ben, nine, Levi, seven, and Neva, five, to work on one day a week, employ a baby sitter for one day, drop them at a friend’s house another day and pay for one day of vacation care.</p>
      <p>She will take unpaid leave on Fridays to look after friends’ children as well as her own.</p>
      <p>Mrs Griffin said the cost of vacation care would outweigh her earnings if she had to put her children in full-time.</p>
      <p>“I understand when people don’t work because it’s so hard to juggle,” she said. “It feels like the school holidays are getting longer.”</p>
