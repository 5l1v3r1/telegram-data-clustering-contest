      <h3>Dimitar Berbatov is backing Sheffield United to hold Manchester United to a draw at Bramall Lane on Sunday afternoon.</h3>
      <p>The Red Devils have won two of their last three Premier League games to hoist themselves up to seventh place in the table before the international break.</p>
      <p>However, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side have still struggled on the road in the current campaign after losing 1-0 to Bournemouth in their last away Premier League fixture.</p>
      <p>Manchester United will start their top-flight clash a point adrift of promoted side Sheffield United after the Blades’ impressive start to the season.</p>
      <p>Sheffield United are in fifth position in the Premier League table following a respectable return of four victories and three stalemates.</p>
      <p>Former Manchester United striker Berbatov doesn’t believe that the Red Devils have enough to beat Sheffield United at Bramall Lane on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“What the **** are Sheffield United doing in fifth place in the Premier League, can someone explain that to me!?” Berbatov told <i>Betfair</i>.</p>
      <p>“Joking aside, they are playing some really good football, their 3-5-2 formation is slick, going to five at the back when someone is attacking them is so effective, they are a solid team and for me they are one of the surprises of the season.</p>
      <p>“Of course I want United to win, but sometimes you have to look at things from the perspective of how things are, it will be a tough game and I think both teams will get a point.”</p>
      <p>Sheffield United are one of the Premier League’s form teams following a five-game unbeaten run to hoist themselves into the European places.</p>
      <p>The promoted side are looking to win three consecutive top-flight home fixtures for the first time since August 1993.</p>
      <p>Manchester United have only managed to win three of their last 10 games on the road in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are looking to win back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since March.</p>
