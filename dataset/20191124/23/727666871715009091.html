      <p>Mia X is hoping to change the way young people view hip-hop.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Shout out to all the OGs who are making an impact and teaching the youth about the fundamentals of hip-hop.</p>
      <p>The first female rapper on No Limit Records Mia X plans to give back in a major way.</p>
      <p>Mia X, real name Mia Young, <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/exclusive-mia-x-records-soundtrack-for-her-popular-things-my-grandma-told-me-culinary-series-_lyf7Ic0w06XHdZi2VNZXw/">is best known for her come up</a>, breaking down the gender barriers of the hip-hop industry and proving females can spit as hard as the men.</p>
      <p>Now has a new identity: Professor X.</p>
      <p>Under the new moniker, she will be teaching rap at the Loyola University School of Music Industry in New Orleans.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://nola.verylocal.com/becoming-professor-x-mia-young-takes-hip-hop-to-a-new-degree/96229/">Mia was brought on board to strengthen the program, though a partnership with chief instructor Lovell “U-P” Cooper.</a>
      </p>
      <p>While she’s used to traveling around the globe playing sold-out shows, this will be the first time she’s performing in front of college students.</p>
      <p>“Most of these children were born between 1999 and 2002. I wasn’t even making records when they were born. I was finished making records," <a href="https://nola.verylocal.com/becoming-professor-x-mia-young-takes-hip-hop-to-a-new-degree/96229/">Mia X told Nola.com</a>. "They did not come up in my era. They did not come up when my music was popular. These children — I call them children because I look at them like my babies — I told them I was their mama the first day I came into class. Even though they are young men, they are definitely babies in this hip-hop game. They are just getting their feet wet.”</p>
      <p>At this point, all the students in the class are comprised of males, which she hopes to change soon.</p>
      <p>She hopes to transform the way audiences view rap as a genre and art form, and not just entertainment.</p>
