      <p>Tim Minchin said he was “traumatised” by the experience of having his animated film Larrikins cancelled.</p>
      <p>The Australian comedian, 44, spent four years developing the project for DreamWorks Animation, but it was shelved indefinitely in 2017.</p>
      <p>Margot Robbie and Hugh Jackman were thought to have signed up to voice characters.</p>

      <p>The same year, despite a commercially successfully and well-reviewed run at the Old Vic in London, his musical adaptation of Groundhog Day closed early on Broadway.</p>
      <p>Minchin told the PA news agency he had found the writing process for his TV series Upright therapeutic.</p>
      <p>He said: “Yeah, I really like it. I mean, this is my first telly script. First script of any description really, apart from my film that will never see the light of day.</p>
      <p>“And what I learnt… I mean, this is the point – I came off the back of losing four years of work in LA and having Groundhog Day shut down on Broadway and I was properly f***ing traumatised by those experiences.</p>
      <p>“But out of that shit… Upright wouldn’t have happened without that, and Upright is the best thing I’ve ever been involved in.</p>
      <p>“So interestingly, the show’s themes are reflected utterly by what the show did for my life, which was get me back on track.”</p>
      <p>Upright airs on Sky Atlantic on November 28 with all episodes available on NOW TV.</p>
