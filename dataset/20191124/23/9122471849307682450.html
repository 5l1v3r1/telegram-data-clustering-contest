      <h1>Jason Garrett Criticized For The Cowboys’ Undisciplined Performance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:51:44+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>You can’t beat the New England Patriots with mistakes. Unfortunately for the Dallas Cowboys, they’ve been unable to avoid them in Foxborough this evening.</p>
      <p>New England is leading Dallas, 10-6, early in the fourth quarter. It’s been an error-filled game for the Cowboys, who haven’t been able to get out of their own way for much of the 2019 regular season.</p>
      <p>Dallas had a punt blocked and an interception in the first half. In the second half, the Cowboys have had multiple penalty-killing drives, along with some crushing special teams mistakes.</p>
      <p>On a rainy, windy night at Gillette Stadium, all of the small things add up quickly. And Jason Garrett’s team has been incapable of doing them successfully tonight.</p>
      <p>Of course, the blame is going to Garrett.</p>
      <p>“I’m really looking forward to Jason Garrett coaching the Giants in 2020. Unless the Cowboys reach the NFC Championship Game, which ain’t happening because we can’t beat good teams, it’s time for a change. We have too much talent to be this crappy,” one fan tweeted.</p>
      <p>“If you were waiting for a Jason Garrett-coached team to do all the little things in poor weather on the road to beat a good opponent… keep waiting. This game is over,” one reporter added.</p>
      <p>It’s been a rough afternoon all along for the Cowboys’ head coach.</p>

      <p>There’s still time left in this game, as the Patriots are leading the Cowboys, 10-6, with a little more than 11 minutes to play.</p>
      <p>Dallas, though, has yet to prove it’s able to avoid the kind of mistakes that will ultimately seal the win for New England.</p>
      <p>The game is on FOX.</p>
