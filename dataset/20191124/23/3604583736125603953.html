      <p>The Art Gallery of Ballarat, as a concert venue, has become a major attraction, with fine performances occurring there on a regular basis, two last week-end. On Friday evening, as a fundraiser for the Ballarat Arts Foundation, the "Love, Lust, Heartache" program presented by two of Australia's long-established opera singers, Peter Coleman-Wright and Cheryl Barker, was a happy blend of art songs and operatic arias from across four centuries.</p>
      <p>Performing solo and together, the sense of enjoyment was easily projected with confidence and security. The contrasts in the varied program were expertly handled, from the folk song-like "It was a lover and his lass" of Finzi to Puccini's "Ah! Che insiem delizioso!" from Manon Lescaut. The Cole Porter medley summed up the perfect communication of the singers and the sympathetic support of accompanist Wendy Rechenberg.</p>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon in the gallery, Melbourne-based chamber choir "Polyphonic Voices" presented an exceptional program of mostly recent American compositions titled "American Thanksgiving". From the ethereal "Three Songs of Faith" (Eric Whitacre) to the harmonically more traditional "Pater Noster" (Nico Muhly) and arrangements of folk song/spirituals, the vocal quality and precision were outstanding. The harmonic textures and balance between parts were exquisitely realised. The endings of soft, long notes, particularly in "Surge, amica mea" (Daniel Knaggs), were sublime as the evenness of the texture and dynamics were perfectly maintained. Conductor Michael Fulcher deserves full credit for creating such an outstanding ensemble and program.</p>
