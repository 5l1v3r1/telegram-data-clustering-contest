      <h1>The Betting Line For Florida-Florida State Has Been Set</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:09:29+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The final matchup of the Florida Cup in 2019 will be Florida vs. Florida State at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in Gainesville.</p>
      <p>Florida is angling for a New Year’s Six bowl game at 9-2 on the season. If not for a close loss to Georgia, they’d be competing in the SEC Championship Game the week after.</p>
      <p>Florida State, on the other hand, has been an unmitigated mess for most of the season. But after firing head coach Willie Taggart, the Seminoles won back-to-back games to secure bowl eligibility at 6-5.</p>
      <p>Despite FSU’s current hot streak, though, the bettors are pretty confident Florida has this game wrapped up.</p>
      <p>According to CircaSports, the hosting Florida Gators are 18 point favorites against the Seminoles.</p>

      <p>The Gators beat the Noles in Tallahassee last year after losing the previous five meetings. But it’s been a decade since Florida beat FSU at home.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the Gators don’t have the kind of homefield advantage over FSU that they really need. And maybe interim head coach Odell Haggins and lock up the job for good if he can lead his Noles to an upset win.</p>
      <p>Then again, maybe the Gators will just steamroll the Noles the way they have almost every other team this year.</p>
      <p>The game will be played at 7:30 p.m. EST and will air on the SEC Network.</p>
