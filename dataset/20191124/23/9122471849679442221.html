      <h1>Mason Rudolph Officially Responds To Myles Garrett’s Allegation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:22:21+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Mason Rudolph and the Steelers will face the Cleveland Browns next weekend. It remains to be seen if Rudolph will start after he was benched earlier today, but he’ll be in uniform.</p>
      <p>Myles Garrett will not. The Browns defensive end has been suspended indefinitely by the NFL after he swung Rudolph’s own helmet at the QB during an altercation in a game 10 days ago.</p>
      <p>During Garrett’s appeal hearing with the NFL this past week, he alleged that Rudolph provoked his actions by calling Garrett a racial slur. Rudolph and his agent vehemently denied the claim.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the NFL said they could not determine that a slur was said. After today’s game, Rudolph was asked to comment on the accusation on the record for the first time.</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, he said Garrett was lying.</p>

      <p>At this point, it doesn’t look like there is any definitive proof regarding what was and wasn’t said on the field in Cleveland that night. Garrett doubled down on his version of the story a couple of days ago.</p>
      <p>Rudolph did the same today, and whoever is lying, they aren’t going to admit their untruthfulness any time soon.</p>
