      <h1>Navy Secretary Richard Spencer asked to resign over Navy SEAL case</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:56:52+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:56</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Uria &amp; Darryl Coote</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 24 (UPI) -- Defense Secretary <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mark-Esper/?tps=1">Mark Esper</a> asked for the resignation of Navy Secretary <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Richard-V-Spencer/?tps=1">Richard V. Spencer</a> on Sunday, citing his handling of the case of a Navy SEAL found guilty of posing for photos with a dead prisoner of war.</p>
      <p>Esper lost "trust and confidence" in Spencer after he learned the Navy secretary had contradicted his public position by privately proposing to the White House that President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a> allow the Navy to conduct an internal review of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher and he would then restore his rank and allow him to retire with his Trident pin.</p>
      <p>"I am deeply troubled by this conduct shown by a senior DOD official," said Esper. "Unfortunately, as a result I have determined that Secretary Spencer no longer has my confidence to continue in his position. I wish Richard well."</p>
      <p>The decision comes one day after Spencer <a href="https://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2019/11/23/Navy-secretary-denies-reports-hell-resign-over-Trumps-intervention-on-Gallagher/4531574559056/">denied reports</a> that he had threatened to resign after President Donald Trump intervened in Gallagher's case.</p>
      <p>In July, Gallagher was acquitted of war crimes charges that included murdering a teenage <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Islamic-State/?tps=1">Islamic State</a> captive, shooting civilians and threatening those who gave their superiors information on him during his time in Iraq. He was convicted of posing for a photo with the IS fighter's dead body and sentenced to four months confinement and loss of rank.</p>
      <p>The Navy's top officer upheld the punishment last month, but Trump restored Gallagher's rank to E-7 and later tweeted that the Navy would not remove his Trident pin.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the Pentagon said that "given the events of the last few days" Esper had directed that Gallagher retain his pin.</p>
      <p>Trump said he thanked Spencer for his service and confirmed that Gallagher will "retire peacefully with all of the honors that he has earned, including his Trident Pin."</p>
      <p>He said Spencer was relieved of his position due to cost overruns and his dissatisfaction with how the Navy handled the Gallagher situation.</p>
      <p>"I was not pleased with the way that Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher's trial was handled by the Navy," Trump said <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1198746358091530241">via Twitter</a>. "He was treated very badly but, despite, this, was completely exonerated on all major charges."</p>
      <p>In his <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/24/politics/read-navy-secretary-richard-spencer-resignation-letter/index.html">resignation letter</a>, Spencer said he couldn't in good conscience continue to serve under Trump due to their conflict of opinions on the issue.</p>
      <p>"As Secretary of the Navy, one of the most important responsibilities I have to our people is to maintain good order and discipline throughout the ranks. I regard this as deadly serious business," he wrote. "Unfortunately, it has become apparent in this respect, I no longer share the same understanding with the Commander in Chief who appointed me, in regards to the key principle of good order and discipline."</p>
      <p>Undersecretary of the Navy Tom Modley will serve as acting Navy secretary and Trump said he will nominate U.S. Ambassador to Norway Kenneth Braithwaite to be the next secretary.</p>
      <p>"A man of great achievement and success, I know Ken will do an outstanding job!" Trump said.</p>
