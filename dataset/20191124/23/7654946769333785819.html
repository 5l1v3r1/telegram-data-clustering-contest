      <h1>Jets enraged by Raiders fans’ boos in MetLife takeover</h1>

      <p>With the weather raw and rainy and the home team sporting a 3-7 record, it was a late-arriving Jets crowd into MetLife Stadium for Sunday’s game against the Raiders.</p>
      <p>There was however, a hearty contingent of Raiders fans — decked out in their black and silver, masks, makeup and all — who turned up early and formed their own pregame Black Hole of sorts, taking over the front several rows of the north end zone.</p>
      <p>Raiders players trotted onto the field first for warm-ups and the Oakland fans cheered loudly.</p>
      <p>Moments later, as the Jets players ran onto the field, loud boos were audible, and they didn’t fall on deaf ears.</p>
      <p>It infuriated the Jets, who were so livid some indicated after the game that it ignited their fast start en route to a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/jets-report-card-adam-gase-doubters-owe-him-credit/">34-3 rout of the Raiders.</a></p>
      <p>The reception the Jets received was the topic of conversation when the players returned to the locker room before the game. Some, including safety and team leader Jamal Adams, spoke up, firing up the rest of the team.</p>
      <p>“We felt disrespected,’’ Jets left tackle Kelvin Beachum told The Post. “We were very unhappy. You never want to get booed in your own stadium, and we came out for pregame warm-ups and were getting booed. I’ve never had that happen in my career in a game at home.</p>

      <p>“There were a lot of guys that were very upset about it. This is a home game for us and we’re coming out of the tunnel to boos. That’s not something you anticipate or expect.</p>
      <p>“Everybody was talking about it in the locker room’’ before the game, Beachum said. “I think it provided a little jolt to us at the start of the game.”</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to lie to you: When we came out onto the field, we felt disrespected,’’ Adams said. “We got booed in our home stadium by Oakland fans. We came back into this locker room and it was a hell of a talk. It was something that needed to be said. I’m not going to get into what was said, but … I came in here and sparked it off.</p>
      <p>“We felt disrespected and went out there and put up or shut up. I don’t want to sound arrogant and cocky, but I think [the Raiders] came in a little too happy, let’s put it like that. They thought it was going to be an easy game. Put it like that.’’</p>
      <p>Listening to some of the Oakland players speak after the game seemed to back up Adams’ assertion that the Raiders, who entered the day on a three-game winning streak, might have taken the Jets lightly.</p>
      <p>“We just didn’t show up today,’’ Raiders defensive tackle Jonathan Hankins said.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t show up … didn’t bring enough energy,’’ Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby said.</p>
      <p>Asked if the game was a “learning experience’’ for his team, Crosby said, “Yeah, you can’t take anyone lightly.’’</p>
      <p>Raiders quarterback Derek Carr said, “Give praise to the Jets; they showed up better than we did,’’ added, “Hopefully, this is an eye-opener.’’</p>
