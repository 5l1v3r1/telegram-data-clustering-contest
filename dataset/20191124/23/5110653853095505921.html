      <h3>Is George Kittle playing Sunday night?</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Kittle is officially ACTIVE.</p>
      <p>Kittle has missed the past two games because of a knee injury, but after getting in limited practices all week, he's listed as "questionable" and says he's moving in the "<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28132854/niners-te-george-kittle-returns-practice-hopes-face-packers">right direction</a>". ESPN's Adam Schefter reported early Sunday morning that Kittle is <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1198482497518088192">expected to play</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WEEK 12 PPR RANKINGS: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-12-fantasy-ppr-rb-rankings-running-back-sleepers/1x0x7s3rojv001j4w68nm8zos7">Running back</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-12-ppr-rankings-wr-fantasy-football-wide-receiver-sleepers/1o9fjg2z6mzra1nyyh9xc82iar">Wide receiver</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-12-fantasy-ppr-rankings-tight-end-sleepers-te/1w752s5mgwmem1ie8oz1iw01e9">Tight end</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>At this point, it's tough to say if Kittle will suit up, but he seems to be trending toward being active. If he's out, Ross Dwelley would once again resume starting TE duties. He's received 12 targets the past two games, and last week against Arizona, he scored two touchdowns. Green Bay is a top-five matchup for TEs, so if Kittle is out, Dwelley is in play as a TE1.</p>
      <p>If you're going to wait out Kittle this week, you should have either Dwelley or someone else from the prime-time games ready to go as a backup. Mark Andrews and Gerald Everett likely aren't available in your league -- and Jimmy Graham might not be either -- so you'd be left with Dwelley or someone like Tyler Higbee or Hayden Hurst. Kittle is worth waiting for, though, and if he's active, he's a must-start even if he plays slightly fewer snaps than usual.</p>
