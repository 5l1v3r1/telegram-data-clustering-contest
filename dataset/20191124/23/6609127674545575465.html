        <b>A TERMINALLY ill mum will try to give her young daughters the best Christmas — despite knowing it will be her last.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jennifer Bell has only a matter of months to live after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease earlier this year.</p>

      <p>But doctors told mum-of-two Jennifer, 28, there was a strong chance she will still be alive into the new year, allowing her to spend precious time with daughters Georgia, eight, and Kacey, one.</p>
      <p>Jennifer said: “I feel OK at the moment — you wouldn’t know anything was wrong with me unless I started talking.</p>
      <p>“Physically nothing’s changed apart from my speech. They told me they won’t be surprised if I’m here for Christmas — however, they think it’ll be early 2020.</p>
      <p>“My oldest daughter goes to Marie Curie for counselling every week and we are preparing her as best we can. They are currently making a book with her of pictures of my life.</p>
      <p>“I have accepted it and I’ll make Christmas as happy as I can for everyone’s sake.”</p>
      <p>Jennifer has given her support to The Scottish Sun’s pop-up Christmas charity shop, which opens on Wednesday with proceeds going to MND Scotland and Alzheimer Scotland.</p>

      <p>She is also staging her own event to raise vital funds.</p>
      <p>Jennifer said: “The support and help MND Scotland offers — for example, complimentary therapies and counselling — are excellent.</p>
      <p>“Those in Scotland who suffer from it and their families couldn’t manage without it in place.”</p>
      <p>We told previously how Jennifer had urged people to stop taking life for granted in a poignant social media post.</p>
      <p>Her perception of life has changed dramatically since she was given the bombshell news.</p>
      <p>She had been studying to become a nurse and had returned to university just two weeks after giving birth to her second daughter in March.</p>
      <p>But as she approached the end of her studies, she was diagnosed with MND and given just a few months to live.</p>
      <p>She described finding out she had the condition as “gut-wrenching”.</p>

      <p>And she told how she can’t stand people moaning about “trivial” things now — and urged people to make the most of their lives.</p>
      <p>Jennifer wrote: “Since being diagnosed with a terminal illness your perception of things, people and places change.</p>
      <p>“Your priorities are different and things that you once took for granted, you no longer do.</p>
      <p>“Day-in day-out, whether it’s on social media or it’s in public, I hear people moaning and I think to myself ‘I wish that’s all I had to worry about’.</p>

        <figcaption>Jennifer also told how her perception of life has changed dramatically</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“We are all human and have difficult times but here’s something for you to think about — not for you to feel bad, simply for you to realise that every day is a gift and you should really count your blessings instead of moaning about what you don’t have.”</p>
      <p>Jennifer told The Scottish Sun how she was surprised at the reaction to her heartfelt message.</p>
      <p>She said: “I wrote my Facebook post in bed one night when I couldn’t sleep and thought nothing of it but it now has over 800 likes and almost 400 shares, which is unbelievable.</p>
      <p>“It’s overwhelming to have so much support.”</p>
      <p>And the mum says she wants to raise awareness of the horrible illness.</p>
      <p>She has arranged an event at Ellangowan Social Club in Milngavie, Glasgow, this Friday for MND Scotland.</p>
      <p>She told us: “While I’m here and able to, I want to raise as much awareness as possible.</p>
      <p>“And hopefully one day a cure will be found.</p>
      <blockquote>I wrote my Facebook post in bed one night when I couldn’t sleep and thought nothing of it but it now has over 800 likes and almost 400 shares, which is unbelievable.</blockquote>
      <p>“If one of my girls grew up and had it I would feel that I had let them down by not trying to do something about it while I could.</p>
      <p>“I want to make them proud of me, like I am of them.”</p>
      <p>Jennifer told on Facebook how she had been a single mum working 60 hours a week as a support worker at the age of 20.</p>
      <p>But she made the decision to go to university to study learning disability nursing as she decided she wanted to improve her life.</p>
      <h3>THANKS TO...</h3>
      <p>WE couldn’t open our Sunta Store and raise cash for chosen charities MND Scotland and Alzheimer Scotland without the generosity of ALL the companies who donate stock and prizes.</p>
      <p>A huge thanks goes to: Amazon, Weber Shandwick, United Wholesalers, St Enoch Centre, Flip Out, Tennent’s, Halloumi, Rioja, Kilmurry &amp; Co, the Irn-Bru Carnival, FRAME, McCurrach, National Trust for Scotland, Quiz, Hudson Sandler, Lidl, Shearer Candles, Stagecoach, SPD Print &amp; Design, Promotional Warehouse Scotland, Decca Records, HarperCollins, Benefit, Edrington, WIRE, Ladbrokes, Tunnock’s, Golden Casket Sweets, Duff Christmas Trees, Aulds, Co-op, Pavilion Theatre, M&amp;D’s, Hilton, SEC, Radio Clyde, Anton Danyluk, The People’s Postcode Lottery, Beattie Communications, Glasgow Distillery Company, Whyte &amp; Mackay, Sun Bingo.</p>
      <p>Her post continued: “I juggled childcare, days in university, writing essays at home, full-time placement, plus I had to work at least three night shifts a week on top of a 37-hour placement week to put food on the table and pay rent.</p>
      <p>“At the end of my long hard journey, when I could see the light at the end of the tunnel, I was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in my final year of studying when I thought my life would finally be easier. That to me is unfair.</p>
      <p>“It’s unfair that two wee kids at 8 and 1 are going to lose their mum.</p>
      <p>“If there’s something you don’t like change it.</p>
      <p>“If you’re not earning enough money bite the bullet, go and study and get a better job.</p>
      <p>“If you’re not happy in a relationship — leave.</p>
      <p>“It’s your life and I believe that the life you live is your choice.</p>
      <p>“Stop wishing for more than you have or you will never find happiness as it comes from within.”</p>

      <h3>200 diagnosed a year</h3>
      <p>JENNIFER is one of 400 people currently living with MND in Scotland</p>
      <p>Around 200 are diagnosed with the condition each year.</p>
      <p>Iain McWhirter head of fundraising at MND Scotland, said: “When everything becomes too much, we’re here to help people through the worst of what MND throws their way and, as Jennifer says, live life to the fullest.</p>
      <p>“Jennifer reminds us that, if we try, every special moment can last a lifetime.”</p>
      <p>MND is a rapidly progressing terminal illness which stops signals from the brain reaching the muscles.</p>
      <p>This may cause someone to lose the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink or breathe unaided. There is currently no cure or effective treatment for MND and the average life expectancy from diagnosis is just 18 months.</p>
      <p>MND Scotland provides a wide range of services including physical, emotional and financial support. The charity is investing £2.3million into research projects across the UK.</p>
