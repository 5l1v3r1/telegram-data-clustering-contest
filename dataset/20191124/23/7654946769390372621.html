      <h1>Bench rallies St. John’s to significant early-season win</h1>

      <p>UNCASVILLE, Conn. — LJ Figueroa and Mustapha Heron were on the bench. St. John’s was trailing underdog UMass by eight. The only positive was the Red Storm weren’t going broke at the nearby craps tables.</p>
      <p>But just when it seemed like they were out of luck, St. John’s rolled a pair of sevens.</p>
      <p>The bench, and Josh Roberts, refused to lose, rallying the Johnnies for a significant early-season victory. From David Caraher’s offensive infusion and Marcellus Earlington’s hustle to Nick Rutherford’s stellar defense and Roberts’ rim-protecting and finishing, the team’s lesser-regarded players keyed a come-from-behind 78-63 victory over UMass in the Hall of Fame Tip-Off consolation game at Mohegan Sun Arena.</p>
      <p>St. Johns trailed by five with 10:54 to go and outscored the Minutemen 30-10 the rest of the way without Heron re-entering and Figueroa coming on late. The two combined for just 13 points, but they weren’t needed. Caraher scored a St. John’s career-high of 17 points, Roberts added 16 points, eight rebounds and three blocks and Rutherford notched six rebounds, two assists and two steals.</p>
      <p>The game took a decided turn early in the second half, Figueroa and Heron picking up their third and fourth fouls, respectively, sending both to the bench. Without their two leading scorers, St. John’s quickly found itself down eight, in a game it led by seven late in the first half.</p>
      <p>Caraher didn’t let the deficit grow wider, quickly hitting a 3-pointer and adding back-to-back driving baskets to get the Johnnies within two. Soon, St. John’s was ahead, on the strength of a 13-1 run that began with a Julian Champagnie 3-pointer and Rutherford completed with a free throw. Roberts put the icing on the game, hammering home a two-handed follow slam to push the lead to nine with 2:47 left.</p>
