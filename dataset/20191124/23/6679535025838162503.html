      <h1>La Liga | Sevilla go third with helping hand from VAR</h1>
      <h2>The win took Sevilla up to third in the standings on 27 points after 14 games, unseating Atletico who drew 1-1 at Granada on Saturday. Valladolid meanwhile are 14th on 17 points.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:32:54+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:32</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Sevilla benefited from two video assistant referee (VAR) interventions to beat Real Valladolid 1-0 on Sunday and climb above Atletico Madrid into third place in La Liga, thanks to a converted penalty from Ever Banega.</p>
      <p>Julen Lopetegui's side were awarded a penalty early in the game after a VAR review determined forward Nolito had been fouled by Valladolid's Javi Moyano as he shaped to shoot, even though his team mates had barely appealed for a foul.</p>
      <p>Argentine midfielder Banega stepped up to take the penalty and his effort was saved by Jordi Masip but VAR informed the match official that the goalkeeper and a re-take was ordered, to the dismay of the home supporters.</p>
      <p>Banega converted his shot at the second time of asking to put Sevilla ahead in the 13th minute on a bitterly cold and wet evening at the Jose Zorrilla stadium.</p>
      <p>Nolito missed a glorious chance to double his side's lead later in a first half which was high on intensity but short on goalmouth action, firing into Masip's hands when unmarked in the box.</p>
      <p>The visitors had talisman Lucas Ocampos sent off for a second booking in stoppage time but they still managed to grind out the victory, becoming the first side to beat Valladolid away from home this season.</p>
      <p>The win took Sevilla up to third in the standings on 27 points after 14 games, unseating Atletico who drew 1-1 at Granada on Saturday. Valladolid meanwhile are 14th on 17 points.</p>
      <p>Lopetegui's side are one point behind leaders Barcelona and second-placed Real Madrid, who beat Leganes and Real Sociedad respectively the previous day and who have a game in hand each.</p>
      <p>“VAR exists to make decisions like this and we players have to just focus on playing,” said match winner Banega.</p>
      <p>“This was a difficult game at a really tough ground and we go home with the three points, which is the most important thing.”</p>
      <p>Valladolid goalkeeper Masip was disappointed that his penalty save counted for nothing.</p>
      <p>“I didn't pay attention to where my feet were, I was focusing on stopping the shot and it seems I moved forward a tiny bit and the rule was applied very harshly. We need to think more about goalkeepers in situations like this,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We played very well, we tried throughout the 90 minutes and we ensured that a top team like Sevilla was made to suffer here.”</p>
