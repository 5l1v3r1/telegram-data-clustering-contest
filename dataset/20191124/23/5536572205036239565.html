      <p>Rob Gronkowski is certainly making himself at home since joining FOX’s NFL crew. That was evident during halftime of Sunday’s Dallas Cowboys-New England Patriots game.</p>
      <p>With the Patriots up 10-6, the former New England tight end went on to explain why the Patriots are much better suited in bad weather, which is what the team is dealing with in their matchup on Sunday at Gillette Stadium.</p>
      <p>He also took aim at owner Jerry Jones for coddling the Cowboys players to play inside a bubble in bad weather.</p>

      <p>Gronk isn’t wrong, as the Cowboys are known for practicing indoors at the Ford Center whenever there is bad weather outside.</p>
