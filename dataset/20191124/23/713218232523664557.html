      <p>Smoke, fires, dust, thick fog - even a drizzle of rain - could not shrink the success of Dorrigo's 108th show or the enthusiasm it generated.</p>
      <p>Final preparations for the show were carried out during 13 weeks of constant threat from bushfires on the plateau and an unwelcome pall of thick smoke every day.</p>
      <p>Some show features, such as the Fun Run, had to be cancelled because of safety concerns or key people being away on fire fighting duties.</p>
      <p>But conditions did not deter a record crowd at the Dorrigo Bull Rides on Friday evening nor a strong sense of celebration during the official opening and grand parade.</p>
      <p>Show officials, speaking on Sunday afternoon, said they were pleased with the outcome, despite the hardships.</p>
      <p>"We believe this weekend has engendered a great deal of happiness and good feelings on the plateau and we feel that is very important," one senior official said.</p>
      <p>Oxley MP Melinda Pavey, a regular guest at the show, warmly commended officials and plateau residents for their efforts in staging the show under difficult conditions.</p>
      <p>"Dorrigo is a wonderful show and more so this year for the challenges currently faced by people living here on the plateau," she said.</p>
      <p>"To Sally Duckett and your team thank you for persevering and delivering the 108th annual Dorrigo Show.</p>
      <p>"Despite the drought, the fires, and the smoke you made it happen, giving everyone the distraction they needed."</p>
      <p>The show was officially opened by Bellinger Shire's Youth of the Year, 2019, Shanlee Duckett, who encouraged young people to help their communities.</p>
      <p>"I would like to encourage all other young people to get involved with volunteering in the community," she said. "This is important for communities and organisations to survive.</p>
      <p>"A great example is the Dorrigo Show which is in its 108th year due to the hard work of a committed team working all year round to deliver a fantastic family event highlighting Dorrigo's versatile agricultural productivity."</p>
      <p>Dorrigo's Show girl for 2020 is Catherine Burley, a fourth generation member of a prominent plateau Jersey stud family.</p>
      <p>Catherine is in her third year studying at the University of Newcastle to be an occupational therapist.</p>
      <p>She spent her morning leading cattle in the dairy section for her family's Moonpah stud.</p>
      <p>She proved to be multi talented, winning prizes in the cooking events: first for a carrot cake and second in a number of other sections.</p>
      <p>Catherine will represent Dorrigo in the regional Show Girl judging which will be held in Dorrigo early next year.</p>
