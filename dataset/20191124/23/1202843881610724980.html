      <p>Algiers:  The secretary general of a youth movement at the forefront of protests in Algeria has been charged with undermining national unity, his lawyer said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Fouad Ouicher of the Youth Action Rally was charged alongside Saida Deffeur, one of the organisation's activists, said lawyer Seddik Mouhous.</p>
      <p>Huge demonstrations started in February against longtime president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, forcing him to resign in April, but weekly rallies have continued against a system many view as illegitimate.</p>
      <p>Alongside undermining national unity, the two are also charged with taking part in rallies without authorisation, on the basis of images recorded on their mobile phones and circulated on social media, added Mouhous.</p>
      <p>They were arrested on Friday after a protest against presidential elections next month and appeared in court on Sunday, he said.</p>
      <p>The defence team boycotted the hearing, in line with a decision by lawyers representing others detained during Algeria's months-long protests.</p>
      <p>Protesters see the presidential election planned for December 12 as a sham, since all five candidates approved to run have links to Bouteflika.</p>
      <p>Two of the candidates -- Ali Benflis and Abdelmadjid Tebboune -- served as prime ministers under the former head of state.</p>
