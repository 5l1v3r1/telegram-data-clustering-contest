      <p>MILAN, Nov 25 — Felipe Caicedo snatched a late winner to keep Lazio third in Serie A with a 2-1 victory over Sassuolo yesterday, just ahead of city rivals Roma, who beat Brescia with England defender Chris Smalling involved in all of his side’s three goals.</p>
      <p>Champions Juventus maintained their grip on the top of Serie A with a 3-1 win at Atalanta on Saturday, to stay one point ahead of Inter Milan who eased past Torino 3-0.</p>
      <p>The two Roman outfits are now third and fourth respectively before Cagliari, a point behind in fifth, play lowly Lecce later yesterday.</p>
      <p>“It’s an important success,” said Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi.</p>
      <p>“Third place consolidated? It’s still early, we are there and the others too, every day things can change.”</p>
      <p>Serie A top-scorer Ciro Immobile struck to put Lazio ahead on 34 minutes with his 15th league goal this season.</p>
      <p>But struggling Sassuolo pulled a goal back through Francesco Caputo just before the break.</p>
      <p>Ecuadorian Caicedo came off the bench to seal a fifth consecutive league win in injury time to keep Lazio seven points behind Inter Milan in third place.</p>
      <p>Roma are now two points behind their local rivals after defender Smalling scored and set up the other two goals in a 3-0 victory over bottom club Brescia.</p>
      <p>Smalling, on loan from Manchester United, headed in the first from a corner in the 48th minute at the Stadio Olimpico.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old then provided the cross that allowed fellow defender Gianluca Mancini to volley in eight minutes later, with Edin Dzeko completing the rout on 66 minutes after Smalling’s headed assist.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes you have to raise your voice,” said Roma coach Paulo Fonseca of his half-time pep talk.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t play with great intensity and aggressiveness in the first half, we were slow, that changed after the break.”</p>
      <p>Smalling added: “Long may this continue, because we’ve got some big ambitions this season and we need to keep improving each game.</p>
      <p>“I’m enjoying my football and I think the team, as you can see, is enjoying our football too. We need to keep going because there is a long way to go yet.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Fight hard’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brescia, now coached by 2006 World Cup winner Fabio Grosso, remain rooted to the bottom of the table.</p>
      <p>Forward Mario Balotelli was dropped for yesterday’s game because of his lack of commitment in training.</p>
      <p>The Italy international tried to play down Thursday’s training ground bust-up with Grosso.</p>
      <p>“Recovery! Coming back soon, for the moment let them talk,” the former Marseille attacker said in a post on Instagram showing him undergoing physiotherapy.</p>
      <p>But Grosso insisted he was not ready to take back the 29-year-old as the promoted side fight for top-flight survival.</p>
      <p>“Mario can be a protagonist in this team if he has the will, the determination and the enthusiasm, which he has so often lacked,” said Grosso.</p>
      <p>“When you are at the bottom of the table like us you need more than a player who knows how to hit the ball hard and score when he can.</p>
      <p>“We need someone ready to work for the team, fight hard for the 90 minutes.”</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Samuel Di Carmine scored the only goal as Verona piled the pressure on Fiorentina, despite Franck Ribery returning after his three-match suspension. </p>
      <p>The Tuscany side are in 10th place with just one point from their last three games. — AFP</p>
