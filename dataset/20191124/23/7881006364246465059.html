      <p><b>Hyderabad: </b>A nine year-old boy died after falling in an elevator shaft from the third floor of a residential apartment at Raidurgam on Sunday. The boy, who was playing along with his elder sister, opened the door of the elevator and was looking down when it hit him while moving down, said Raidurgam police.</p>
      <p>According to police, Sesha Bhattachary, a priest, along with his wife, Priya, and four children including Dhanush, 9, moved to TVS Lake View Apartments located at Panchavati Colony in Raidurgam about one and a half months ago.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>There are four blocks in the premises with 28 flats in each block. The family was living on the seventh floor of the B1 block, and each floor has seven flats.</p>
      <p>The police said that the incident took place at around 5 pm when Dhanush along with his elder sister was playing on the fourth floor.</p>
      <p>“The boy was constantly pulling the elevator door and it suddenly opened while the lift was above. Unaware of this, Dhanush peeped through the shaft and the elevator which was moving downwards hit him and he fell to the ground floor from the third floor. He died on the spot with a severe head injury” said Raidurgam sub-inspector Saidulu.</p>
      <p>The SI said that the door should open only when the elevator stops on the particular floor.</p>
      <p>A case of suspicious death has been registered currently and based on the outcome of the investigation, sections of the case will be altered if necessary, the police officer said.</p>
      <p>Dhanush, the third child of the couple Bhattachary and Priya couple, was learning Vedas at home. He was about to join a Veda pathashala soon.</p>
