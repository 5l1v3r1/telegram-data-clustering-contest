      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:19:35+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:19</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Davidson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/tom-davidson/</a></address>
      <p>A drug submarine carrying 3,000kg of cocaine was intercepted by police off the coast of Spain.</p>
      <p>The vessel appeared in waters off the northwestern region of Galicia on Sunday, a source with the central government's delegation to the region told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Spanish media report that the submarine was from Colombia and police are trying to work out whether it sailed all the way from South America with the drugs.</p>
      <p>Narco-subs have been used to smuggle drugs from Latin America into the US.</p>
      <p>The source said: "Early this morning an international operation was able to locate a small submarine of around 20 meters near the beach of Hio in the province of Pontevedra."</p>

      <p>News agency EFE reported that the vessel was carrying some 3,000 kilograms of cocaine, citing sources from Spain's Guardia Civil.</p>
      <p>Two South American men were detained as part of the operation, in which the Guardia Civil and National Police participated, while a third man escaped, the source said.</p>
      <p>The submarine is  20 metres long with Galician Minister Javier Losada stating that this “method of drug trafficking is very inventive for the transportation of drugs in the Galician coast.”</p>
      <p>Authorities will attempt to refloat the vessel on Monday morning after attempts on Sunday proved unsuccessful.</p>
