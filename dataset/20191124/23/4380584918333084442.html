      <h1>Canó praises Mets' 'great hire' in Beltrán</h1>

      <p>MIAMI -- After a tough start to his Mets career in 2019, Robinson Canó will report to Spring Training in February looking to prove that he can remain healthy and productive as New York’s starting second baseman. Next season, his playing time will be in the hands of new manager Carlos Beltrán.</p>
      <p>Canó was traveling in Europe when Beltrán’s hiring was announced on Nov. 1. He says he reached out to congratulate Beltrán, but that there has not been much communication between them since.</p>
      <p>“For me, it was a great hire,” Canó said, in Spanish, at the 12th annual David Ortiz Celebrity Golf Classic in Miami. “We all know the kind of person Carlos is and what kind of player he was. I think he’s going to help us a lot, on and off the field.”</p>
      <p>A nine-time All-Star, Beltrán played 20 seasons in the Majors with seven teams, including the Mets from 2005-11 and the Yankees from 2014-16. Following his retirement as a player after the 2017 season, he spent a year as a special advisor to Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, but has never coached or managed at any level in professional baseball.</p>
      <p>Canó believes Beltrán will do well as skipper despite his lack of experience, but emphasized the importance of having a qualified bench coach. Former Major League managers Jerry Narron and Fredi González have all emerged as candidates for the position, as well as longtime coach Hensley Meulens, who most recently served as the Giants’ bench coach.</p>
      <p>“Always, to be a good manager, you have to start with a good bench coach,” Canó said. “The decisions happen quickly. If you have someone good next to you, he’s going to help you make those decisions and make sure they are good.”</p>
      <p>Canó, who at 37 is the oldest player currently on the Mets' roster, has four seasons left on the 10-year, $240 million contract he signed with the Mariners prior to the 2014 season. He hit .256 with 13 home runs, 39 RBIs and a .736 OPS in 107 games in his first season in Queens after being acquired in a trade with Seattle prior to the 2019 season.</p>
      <p>Canó said in September that he had no plans to alter his offseason routine after landing on the injured list three times this year because of leg ailments.</p>
      <p>“Not really, because if it’s something that gave me results for like 13 or 14 years, that’s just the body,” said Canó.</p>
