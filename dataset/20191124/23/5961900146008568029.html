      <h1>Score Free Flights Or Accommodation (+ Condoms) For A Summer Vacay Designed To Get You Laid</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:26:48+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:26</time> by <a rel="author">By Steph Panecasio</a></address>

        <a href="https://lifestyles.com.au/pages/summer-lovin">PEDESTRIAN.TV has teamed up with LifeStyles to get you more bang for your buck.</a>
      </p>
      <p>There’s nothing quite like getting steamy on a summer holiday. It’s the perfect combination of factors designed to make doing the deed feel more satisfying than ever before — from someone else making the bed after you’ve somehow wound up (ahem) making a mess, to a nearby beach that you can dive in to cool your jets.</p>
      <p>You know the one thing that can make that situation even hotter? Not having to pay for it. We’re talking free flights, we’re talking free accommodation, and yes, we’re talking free condoms and lube.</p>
      <p>Your skin-tinglingly close mates at LifeStyles are running a big ol’ competition, inspired by the concept of <a href="https://lifestyles.com.au/pages/summer-lovin">Summer Lovin’</a> and aimed to get your motor running this summer. Best part? You can go in the running whether you’re already loved up or if you’re on the prowl for some prime post-winter partnering.</p>

        <i>my body is ready</i>
      </p>
      <p>Not sure what you’re in for? Allow me to flesh it out… So to speak. Rest assured, the process for entering isn’t <i>too</i> long and hard.</p>
      <p>All you’ve got to do is purchase any LifeStyles products, then <a href="https://lifestyles.com.au/pages/summer-lovin">head online</a> and tell ’em in 25 words or less where you’d want to go to get down or meet the hunky summer fling of your dreams. Pop in your details and you’re set!</p>
      <p>The more LifeStyles gear you buy, the more entries you can have — so depending how quickly you shloop out your lube or hammer through a box of dommies, you could have more of a crack at winning.</p>
