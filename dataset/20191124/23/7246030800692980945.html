      <p>British Police say they have detained a suspect in connection with a vicious anti-Semitic attack last Friday by a man on the London Underground who verbally browbeat a Jewish family despite numerous attempts by other passengers to intervene.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The suspect was arrested in Birmingham a day after the incident and now faces charges of a racially aggravated public order offense, according to a <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/birmingham-northern-line-semitic-arrest-3572116">report on the <i>StokeOnTrentLive</i> news site</a>.</p>
      <p>“A man has been arrested in connection with an anti-Semitic incident on the London Underground,” said a spokesperson for the British Transport Police, who said officers “attended an address in Birmingham” Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>“The man was arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated section 5 public order offense,” the spokesperson said, adding that the man “remains in custody” after harassing passengers and targeting them “with anti-Semitic abuse.”</p>
      <p>Filmmaker Chris Atkins was a passenger on the Northern Line train at the time, and he caught the incident on video, filming the man holding a Bible in his hands and jamming his finger at the page while hurling anti-Semitic slurs at the family as he stood towering over them.</p>
      <p>Although the Jewish man seemed not to be intimidated at the time, his young son was very frightened.</p>
      <p>A courageous Muslim woman, Asma Shuweikh, confronted the attacker and slammed him for his behavior before he left the train despite his threats to physically assault other passengers. The Jewish father has said he would like to meet her in person to thank her, now that the terrifying event is over.</p>
