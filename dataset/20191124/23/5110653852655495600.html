      <h1>Fantasy Injury Updates: Julian Edelman, Alshon Jeffery, Emmanuel Sanders among Week 12 WR active/inactive worries</h1>

      <p>It's not a bad week for important WR injuries. JuJu Smith-Schuster has already been declared out (which his owners likely don't mind), and we've already been graced with the returns of Will Fuller and T.Y. Hilton. Heading into Sunday's games, Julian Edelman, Alshon Jeffery, Emmanuel Sanders, Deebo Samuel, Nelson Agholor, Mohamed Sanu, and Phillip Dorsett are the most important "questionable" wide receivers, butWeek 12 fantasy start 'em, sit 'em decisions shouldn't be impacted too much. We'll have the latest updates below throughout the day.</p>

      <h3>Is Julian Edelman playing Week 12?</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Edelman is officially ACTIVE.</p>
      <p>Edelman (shoulder) is once again listed as "<a href="https://twitter.com/NoraPrinciotti/status/1197986392095240192">questionable</a>" despite not being a realistic injury worry the entire week. There's no reason to expect him to sit when the Patriots play the Cowboys Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Given New England's spate of other WR injuries (see below), Edelman will likely see even more targets than usual. He's a solid WR2 in standard leagues and a borderline WR1 in PPR leagues.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Alshon Jeffery injury update</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Jeffery is officially OUT.</p>
      <p>After "<a href="https://twitter.com/DZangaroNBCS/status/1197896961946476544">trending in the right direction</a>" all week, Jeffery (ankle) was listed as "questionable" for Sunday's game against the Seahawks.</p>
      <p>The expectation is that Jeffery will play (ESPN's Adam Schefter <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1198482331641749506">reported as much</a> early Sunday morning), and given the matchup against a leaky Seattle secondary that allows a lot of wide receiver receptions, he's a viable WR3, especially PPR leagues.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Is Emmanuel Sanders playing Sunday night?</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Sanders is officially ACTIVE.</p>
      <p>After getting in limited practices all week, Sanders (ribs) is "<a href="https://twitter.com/mattbarrows/status/1197990458846171136">questionable</a>" for Sunday night's game against the Packers.</p>
      <p>It's likely Sanders will be active, but like last week, he probably won't be fully healthy or play a full complement of snaps. At this point, he's a risky WR3, and given the prime-time start, you'd need to have another prime-time backup ready to go if he's a surprise scratch. If he's out, Deebo Samuel, who's also questionable, and Kendrick Bourne would see the biggest uptick in targets.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Deebo Samuel injury update</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Samuel is officially ACTIVE.</p>
      <p>Samuel (shoulder) was limited in practice throughout the week, and like Sanders, he's also "questionable" for Sunday night's game against the Packers. The San Francisco Chronicle reports he is <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/49ers/article/49ers-George-Kittle-could-be-healed-enough-to-14856461.php">expected to play</a>, though, and ESPN's Adam Schefter <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1198482497518088192">echoed that</a> early Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>Samuel has posted back-to-back eight-catch, 100-plus-yard games. He's a decent WR3 even if Sanders and George Kittle (knee) are active, as both could be more limited than usual, though Samuel owners should temper their expectations a bit.</p>
      <h3>Nelson Agholor injury news</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Agholor is officially OUT.</p>
      <p>Like Jeffery, Eagles coach Doug Pederson said Agholor (knee) is "<a href="https://twitter.com/DZangaroNBCS/status/1197896961946476544">trending in the right direction</a>" earlier this week. He's officially "questionable" for Sunday's game against Seattle, and ESPN's Adam Schefter reported early Sunday morning that he's <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1198482331641749506">unlikely to play</a>.</p>
      <p>If Jeffery plays, Agholorshouldn't be started in fantasy leagues. However, if Jeffery is out, Agholor is in play as a WR3 in PPR leagues because of all the receptions Seattle allows to wide receivers.</p>
      <h3>Mohamed Sanu, Phillip Dorsett injury updates</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Sanu and Dorsett are officially OUT.</p>
      <p>According to the Boston Herald, Sanu (ankle) is <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/11/22/patriots-wr-mohamed-sanu-expected-to-miss-sundays-game-vs-cowboys/">not expected to play</a> on Sunday against the Cowboys, though ESPN's Adam Schefter reported early Sunday morning that Sanu <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1198481736952418304">won't make a final decision until after warm-ups</a>, as he was feeling better on Saturday. Phillip Dorsett (concussion) is unlikely to play, as he's <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeReiss/status/1198241620115759104">yet to be cleared for football activities</a> as of Saturday.</p>
      <p>Assuming both receivers are out, N'Keal Harry and possibly even Jakobi Meyers make for WR3 sleepers. Harry makes more sense as a boom-or-bust WR3 in standard leagues, but Meyers has more appeal in PPR formats.</p>
