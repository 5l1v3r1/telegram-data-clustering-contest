      <p>REUTERS: French luxury group LVMH is nearing a deal to buy U.S. jewelry chain Tiffany &amp; Co for about US$16.3 billion, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday.</p>
      <p>LVMH is nearing a deal to acquire the chain for US$135 per share, the source said, adding that a deal could be announced as early as Monday.</p>

      <p>Reuters reported earlier this week that LVMH had persuaded Tiffany to provide it with confidential due diligence after it raised its bid to close to US$16 billion.</p>
      <p>Tiffany this month rebuffed LVMH's initial US$120-per-share all-cash offer, arguing it significantly undervalued the company.</p>
      <p>The news was first reported by the Financial Times.</p>
      <p>Both companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.</p>
