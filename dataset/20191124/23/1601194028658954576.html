      <p>The team of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/dolph-ziggler">Dolph Ziggler</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/bobby-roode">Robert Roode</a> from <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/smackdown">SmackDown</a> won the battle royal to score the first point for the Blue Brand.</p>

      <h3>The Tag Team Battle Royal</h3>
      <p>The Battle Royal match featured 3 teams from RAW (The OC, Zack Ryder &amp; Curt Hawkins, and The Street Profits), 3 teams from NXT (The Forgotten Sons, Breezango and Imperium) and 4 teams from SmackDown (The Revival, Dolph Ziggler &amp; Robert Roode, Lucha House Party and Heavy Machinery).</p>
      <p>According to the rules, if one member of the team gets eliminated by getting thrown over the top rope, the whole team gets eliminated. The Forgotten Sons were the first team to get eliminated after Steve Cutler was tossed out.</p>
      <p>Gradually, the number of Superstars in the ring got lesser as more and more tag teams got eliminated and it was down to The Street Profits and Ziggler &amp; Roode. At one point it looked like The Street Profits were going to pick up the win but in the end, Roode eliminated Montez Ford to get the win.</p>
