      <h1>Kyle Richards, Dorit Kemsley And Sutton Stracke Throw Shade At Former RHOBH Co-Star Lisa Vanderpump By Wearing Crowns â€“ Details!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:37:07+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:37</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Markus</a></address>
      <p>While in attendance at an event, it seemed like several Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast members were trying to throw some shade at former co-star, Lisa Vanderpump. More precisely, Dorit Kemsley, newcomer, Sutton Stracke, as well as Kim Richards all wore crowns as they posed for pics which might mean that they were making reference to Lisaâ€™s season 7 tagline!</p>
      <p>Now, fans are convinced Kylie Richards was indeed dissing her ex best friend with her post.</p>
      <p>All three ladies can be seen rocking crowns with floral motifs as they pose for the camera and in the caption, Kyle wrote: â€˜If the crown fits, wear it ðŸ‘‘.â€™</p>
      <p>At the time, the RHOBH co-stars were are a Dolce and Gabbana store in Rome, Italy and were definitely feeling themselves!</p>
      <p>As for the reason why social media thinks the crowns and the pictureâ€™s caption were all meant to shade the former member of the cast, itâ€™s that in season 7, Lisa Vandeprumpâ€™s tagline was: â€˜The crown is heavy, darlings. So just leave it where it belongs.â€™</p>

      <p>And that is not all! This pic comes after Erika Girardi pretty much declared Kyle the new â€˜queenâ€™ of the series since she is an OG.</p>
      <p>Erika told boss Andy Cohen that â€˜Not only is she the original, but sheâ€™s the leader of the group. ..Because she is the one we are all connected to, she binds us together.â€™</p>
      <p>Dorit, who also has beef with Lisa over the whole PuppyGate scandal, took to her platform to share a clip of the three ladies posing with the crowns as well, writing alongside it: â€˜Outta my way ladies ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘‘@kylerichards18 @suttonstracke @dolcegabbana.â€™</p>
      <p>Fittingly enough, in the video, she pushes them away.</p>
      <p>To make it even more obvious that they were shading Lisa, Doritâ€™s husband, PK commented: â€˜Clearly wasnâ€™t that heavy â€¦ðŸ¤£.â€™</p>
      <p>In case you were thinking the crown-wearing and the captions were just a coincidence, the manâ€™s comment shattered all doubts about their intentions.</p>
