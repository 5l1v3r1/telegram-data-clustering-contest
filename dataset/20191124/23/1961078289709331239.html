      <h1>A Threat Against Times Square on Reddit, and Police Are Mobilized</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:02:52+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:02</time> by <a rel="author">Christina Goldbaum</a></address>
      <p>Early on Sunday morning, the New York governor’s office received a concerning message from law enforcement officials: Someone had made a threat online to detonate a bomb in Times Square.</p>
      <p>It was deemed that the threat was not credible, officials said. But soon after receiving the news, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo released a statement at around 10 a.m. calling for increased police presence in Times Square and an investigation into the online post.</p>
      <p>“The bomb threat made against Times Square is a despicable and cowardly act meant to instill fear and panic in our community, and New Yorkers will not tolerate these scare tactics,” Mr. Cuomo’s statement read, and added that “there is no indication that this threat is credible.”</p>

      <p>The unusually public response to a threat police deemed not credible underscores officials’ sensitivity to the security of New York City landmarks and Mr. Cuomo’s eagerness to appear proactive in addressing them.</p>
      <p>In response to the post, the New York Police Department said they had opened an investigation and had increased police presence in the area, although they would not specify how many additional officers were deployed. The iconic New York City area has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/nyregion/06shahzad.html?module=inline">the target of terrorist plots</a> at least twice in the last decade, both of which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/nyregion/times-square-plot-attack.html?module=inline">were foiled</a> by the authorities.</p>
      <p>But that the governor would draw attention to an unsubstantiated threat made on the online chat forum Reddit seemed to surprise some New Yorkers. Mayor Bill de Blasio even took to Twitter to remind New Yorkers that police had deemed the threat not credible.</p>
      <p>“The N.Y.P.D. always maintains a strong security presence in Times Square. They are investigating this morning’s threat but do not deem it credible,” <a href="https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1198629814032359424?s=20">Mr. De Blasio wrote </a>almost an hour after Mr. Cuomo’s statement.</p>
      <p>The governor issued the statement to address concerns from New Yorkers after news of the threat began to spread on social media, according to a state official.</p>
      <p>The post, published in a Reddit forum for Bronx residents that has around 2,700 members, warned that the author planned to detonate a bomb in Times Square and target minorities. The message was removed around three hours after it was published, according to Reddit users, and had garnered two up-votes — the Reddit equivalent of a “like” — and four comments.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Reddit confirmed the post had been removed and that the user had been permanently banned from the site.</p>
      <p>One Reddit user who saw the threat took a screenshot of it and <a href="https://twitter.com/LandlordLinks/status/1198579360376246272?s=20">posted it on Twitter to alert law enforcement</a> officials.</p>
      <p>“It was alarming to see that. I don’t think we can take these things lightly now, there’s a lot of anger and things are a lot more tense today,” said Kirby Sommers, a Manhattan-based real estate consultant, who noticed the post on Sunday morning when she was doing her routine scan on Reddit for potential clients.</p>
      <p>The post came as Times Square geared up for the busy holiday season, when shoppers flood the area’s stores and visitors line the streets to watch the ball drop on New Years Eve. Around 360,000 people visited the area daily in November and December 2018, according to the Times Square Alliance, which supports local businesses.</p>
      <p>On Sunday afternoon, Times Square was buzzing with life as usual. Tourists in plastic ponchos took selfies next to the Disney Store. A light rain sprinkled hot dog vendors and street performers. Many people had not heard about the bomb threat, but even those who did appeared unfazed.</p>
      <p>“I heard Cuomo saying something about how we needed to stay vigilant. I thought, ‘Whatever.’ This is New York, you know?,” said Robert Burck, 48, a Times Square street performer. “But it also kind of gave me a little motivation to come out today. You know, out in the rain, because we’re not scared.”</p>
