      <h2>Sir Alex Ferguson opens up about Man United's current situation under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</h2>

      <h3>Sir Alex Ferguson is confident that Manchester United will be able to turn around their form under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</h3>
      <p>It has been something of a stop-start few months for the Red Devils under their new boss, with Manchester United having struggled to find consistency in the Premier League all season.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are currently quite some way of the top four in the race to secure Champions League qualification for next season.</p>
      <p>Manchester United have struggled to find consistent form ever since Ferguson called time on his glittering career at Old Trafford back in 2013.</p>
      <p>However, the former Red Devils boss seems to be confident that Manchester United will be able to get things right under Solskjaer in the coming weeks and months.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/sir-alex-ferguson-speaks-manchester-uniteds-struggles-ole-gunnar-solskjaer-11205835/">Metro</a> before the clash with Sheffield United, Ferguson said: “Well, we’ve got a great structure at the club. We’ve got a lot of good young players coming through, that’s never changed.</p>
      <p>“There’s always that challenge, and what’s happening at the moment is a challenge, but with a bit of luck – and a bit of perseverance – we’ll sort it out.”</p>
      <p>Manchester United will return to Premier League action with a home clash against Aston Villa at Old Trafford next weekend.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are aiming to try and break back into the top four this season after they finished sixth and without a trophy last season.</p>
