      <h3>The family of tragic Premier League footballer Jlloyd Samuel has accused his wife of “faking” his death in a fireball car crash - to cash in on an insurance fraud.</h3>
      <p>The sister of the former Aston Villa and Bolton Wanderers defender believes her brother is still alive.</p>
      <p>The family allege that Jlloyd was not at the wheel of his £100,000 Range Rover when it burst into fire after crashing on in May 2018 on a country lane in Cheshire.</p>

      <p>They hoped to raise their concerns at an inquest into his death which is due to open on Tuesday November 26.</p>
      <p>But Jlloyd’s sister and parents have complained that the coroner and Cheshire Police have refused to allow the family to carry out their own DNA tests on the remains found in the car.</p>
      <p>Furious sister Leslie-Ann Samuel posted a picture of a letter from the coroner’s office in which they explain how Jlloyd’s remains were identified by dental records and radiographs carried out at Warrington hospital on 17 May 2018.</p>

      <p>Leslie-Ann has also made a string of bizarre claims on social media since her brother’s death.</p>
      <p>She said: “Jlloyd we WILL see you soon, in this life.”</p>
      <p>Leslie-Ann wrote in another post: “Jlloyd brother we know you are ALIVE and well and we know the DNA the pathologist have is not your DNA .. 100%... Lies…”</p>
      <p>Jlloyd married Emma in 2008 and the interior designer has three children with him.</p>
      <p>A Cheshire police spokesman confirmed the force had received a complaint from a member of Jlloyd’s family regarding the investigation into his accident.</p>
      <p>The spokesman said: “Her complaint was investigated thoroughly by senior officers who ruled that the investigation into Mr Samuel’s death was proportionate, timely and of the standard required.</p>
      <p>“These conclusions were verified in a peer review by an independent police force.</p>

      <p>As such, the complaint was not upheld.</p>
      <p>“The family member has been informed of this and of the conclusions reached following the investigation into her complaint.</p>
      <p>“She was given a 28-day period in which they could appeal the decision, but no appeal was received.”</p>
      <p>Last night Jlloyd’s widow Emma refused to comment at her home in Lymm, Cheshire, about the allegations from his family.</p>
      <p>But she added: “I do not wish to make any comment at this time. My only concern right now is getting through next week’s inquest and protecting my three beautiful children who have had to not only deal with the tragic loss of their father but also witness relentless fake news, threats and personal attacks on social media. I will make a short statement at the conclusion of the inquest and would ask for our privacy to be respected until then.”</p>
      <p>Leslie-Ann did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
      <p>In September 2018 The Sun on Sunday revealed Jlloyd had secretly married a second wife in Iran, singer Helia Sahimi, where he played at the end of his career.</p>
