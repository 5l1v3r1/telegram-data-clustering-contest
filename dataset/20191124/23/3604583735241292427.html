      <h1>Jasper wasn't much of a reader, until he met some Western Bulldogs</h1>

      <p>WHEN he has a bit of free time, Canadian Lead pupil Jasper likes to grab a book to read and relax. Jasper's favourite books right now are Tui T Sutherland's Wings of Fire graphic novel series, delving into fantasy worlds of dragons.</p>
      <p>It is a big change for Jasper who used to not like reading or writing at all, only doing what he needed to get by at school.</p>
      <p>Then Jasper met some Western Bulldogs players and got talking about books. Jasper was in grade three when first introduced to the club's Bulldogs Read program, an exclusive literacy program in partnership with Ballarat Libraries for selected schools and pupils who need a bit of a reading boost.</p>

      <p>Jasper had a year off but this year asked teachers if he could rejoin Bulldogs Reads because he felt it made a difference, not just in his school work but in confidence to try new things.</p>
      <blockquote>I asked because the program made me like writing and reading again.<cite>Jasper, grade five</cite></blockquote>
      <p>"I asked because the program made me like writing and reading again," Jasper said. "It also gets kids more interested in sports - not just the kids who are good at sports."</p>
      <p>Pupils write book reviews for Western Bulldogs' AFL players to read and, if lucky, to chat about with them in a Skype session. Reviews are also published on the <a href="https://www.bulldogsread.com.au/book-reviews-2019">Bulldog Read website</a> to share with others. A record 498 reviews were posted this year from pupils at Alfredton, Warrenheip, Yuille Park and Canadian Lead primary schools.</p>

      <p>Japser used to review Aaron Blabey's popular Pig the Pug picture books but said he had moved well past picture books to now enjoying detailed chapter books.</p>
      <p>He has also become a passionate football fan, devouring statistics but also enjoying reading about different players.</p>
      <p>Western Bulldogs is his team now - Jasper was converted from Collingwood - and had a chance to take his grandma to a Bulldogs AFL game at Docklands. Jasper was one of the lucky few readers to earn a ticket to the Bulldogs' round 23 clash at Mars Stadium - with finals on the line - and chose to take his pop, who had not been to an AFL game for 63 years.</p>
      <p>"Pop had fun but says he wouldn't give up fishing for it," Jasper quipped. They like to kick a footy together after school some nights.</p>

      <p>Bulldogs' star midfielder Marcus Bontempelli is Jasper's favourite player. The Bont had a chat to Jasper after a training session at the Bulldogs' Whitten Oval base one day. Jasper had a sprained arm at the time.</p>
      <blockquote>Definitely ask to do it. This was the best experience I've done at this school.<cite>Jasper, grade five</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Canadian Lead Bulldogs Read teacher Leslie Sullivan said watching the progress of students in Jasper was incredible, not just in reading but in overall confidence.</p>
      <p>"We had about 20 students from grades three, four and five and were feeding off each other. Some were avid readers already but this program gave purpose to writing about it because players do read reviews," Ms Sullivan said.</p>
      <p>"They saw themselves as members of a little team.</p>
      <p>"There are so many different experiences for these kids. I came from a strong football background, talking about footy is part of my life growing up. These kids don't get to play much football so linking that interest has a spin-off effect with us now identifying more AFL players and knowledge, which is a big thing in Victoria."</p>
      <p>For those thinking about trying the program Jasper's advice is clear: "Definitely ask to do it. This was the best experience I've done at this school".</p>
      <p>Bulldogs Read is part of a suite of Western Bulldogs' community programs in Ballarat, including holistic health forums Sons of the West and Daughters of the West and youth Leadership Project.</p>
