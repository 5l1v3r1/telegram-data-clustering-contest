      <p>Dame Maggie Smith and Andrew Scott were among the big winners at the Evening Standard’s Theatre Awards.</p>
      <p>Dame Maggie was awarded her fifth Natasha Richardson Award for best actress for her performance as Goebbels’ secretary in A German Life, fending off competition from Hayley Atwell, Cecilia Noble, Juliet Stevenson and Anjana Vasan.</p>
      <p>The veteran stage and screen star, 84, now holds the record for the most wins in the category, having previously won the accolade in 1962, 1970, 1984 and 1994.</p>

      <p>Smith was nominated for her role in Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.</p>
      <p>Duff’s other competitor in the musical category was Fiddler On The Roof’s Andy Nyman.</p>
      <p>Play of the year went to American playwright Lynn Nottage’s Sweat, a production that explores the relationships and fears of a community left divided by de-industrialisation.</p>
      <p>Oscar-winner and star of The Crown Olivia Colman was in attendance at the event to present the prize for Nottage’s play.</p>
      <p>Nottage is the first and only woman to have won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama twice in America – first for Ruined in 2009 and then in 2017 for Sweat, which made its Broadway debut that year.</p>
      <p>Sir Ian McKellen accepted the editor’s award for his Ian McKellen On Stage tour, which saw him perform to more than 80 theatres in the year of his 80th birthday.</p>
