      <p>RIYADH: Women’s rights in the Kingdom have seen an unprecedented transformation, thanks to the historical decisions made under the leadership of King Salman, said Dr. Awwad Al-Awwad, president of the Saudi Human Rights Commission (HRC) in his opening speech at a symposium on International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.</p>
      <p>He explained that the day aimed to raise awareness about the magnitude of the multiple forms of violence women around the world are exposed to.</p>
      <p>It provides an opportunity to defend, promote, and transform women’s rights into constructive dialogues, so that they may live in a better world.</p>
      <p>Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has accorded high priority to women’s rights, affirmed Al-Awwad. Among over 60 recent decisions made to improve the situation of human rights in the Kingdom, 22 were related to women. </p>
      <p>These included issuing such laws as the Protection from Abuse Law and the Anti-Harassment Law, eliminating the guardianship system, allowing women to drive, ensuring greater female participation in the workforce, especially the legal sphere, dedicating a call center for domestic violence issues, establishing the Family Affairs Council (one of whose committees is devoted to women’s affairs) and setting up courts for family cases.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>Violence against women was one of the most widespread, persistent and destructive human rights violations in the world, but that most of it remained unreported.</b>

      </blockquote>
      <p>Al-Awwad confirmed none of this would have been possible without political will.</p>
      <p>Women are the foundation of society, being the schools that shape future generations, instillers and upholders of good values handed down across generations, he said.</p>
      <p>Al-Awwad also met with German Minister of State Niels Annen at the German Federal Foreign Office, where they reviewed issues related to human rights.</p>
      <p>Al-Awwad highlighted the Kingdom’s efforts, under the leadership of the king and crown prince, in supporting human rights. He pointed to developments in the Kingdom and pioneering steps toward achieving sustainable development on making human beings the focus of development in accordance with Vision 2030, which aims to achieve the overall development of a better future for the country.</p>
