      <p>Nov. 24 (UPI) -- The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Chicago_Bears/?tps=1">Chicago Bears</a> bounced back from last week's loss to the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/los-angeles-rams/?tps=1">Los Angeles Rams</a> with a 19-14 win over the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New_York_Giants/?tps=1">New York Giants</a> on Sunday at Soldier Field.</p>
      <p>Bears star pass-rusher <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Khalil-Mack/?tps=1">Khalil Mack</a> set up a touchdown with a strip-sack of Giants quarterback Daniel Jones, while wideout <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Allen-Robinson/?tps=1">Allen Robinson</a> recorded a season-high 131 receiving yards and a score to give Chicago (5-6) its second win in three games.</p>
      <p>The Giants (2-9) lost their seventh straight game and clinched their third consecutive losing season with Sunday's defeat.</p>
      <p>New York grabbed a 7-0 lead midway through the first quarter after Kaden Smith hauled in a 3-yard touchdown pass from Jones. Eddy Pineiro converted a 26-yard field goal before the end of the first to cut the Bears' deficit to 7-3.</p>
      <p>Bears quarterback <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mitchell-Trubisky/?tps=1">Mitchell Trubisky</a> tossed a 32-yard touchdown to Robinson early in the third quarter and Pineiro added a 24-yard kick to boost their lead to 13-7.</p>
      <p>Mack notched only his second sack in seven games when he brought down Jones deep in Giants territory and stripped the ball. Bears defensive lineman <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Nick_Williams/?tps=1">Nick Williams</a> recovered the fumble, which led to a 2-yard touchdown run by Trubisky to make it 19-7 late in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>The Giants cut the lead to five with 4:10 remaining in the game after Golden Tate came down with a 23-yard score on fourth-and-18. Chicago went three-and-out before punter Pat O'Donnell pinned the Giants at their own 6-yard line, and the Bears held on to seal the victory.</p>
      <p>Trubisky completed 25-of-41 passes for a season-high 278 yards. He had one touchdown pass and threw two interceptions.</p>
      <p>Jones was 21-of-36 for 150 yards and two touchdowns. Giants star running back <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Saquon-Barkley/?tps=1">Saquon Barkley</a> had 17 carries for 59 yards and two receptions for one yard.</p>
      <p>The Giants will host the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Green_Bay_Packers/?tps=1">Green Bay Packers</a> next Sunday. Chicago will play the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Detroit-Lions/?tps=1">Detroit Lions</a> on Thursday.</p>
