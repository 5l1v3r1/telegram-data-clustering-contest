      <p>The crew of a Russian passenger plane desperately appealed for medical help on Sunday after a pilot suffered from an acute health problem mid-flight, according to <i>Russia Today</i>.</p>
      <p>The pilot died shortly after the jet made an emergency landing.</p>
      <p>The Aeroflot Airbus 320 took off from Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport on its way to Anapa, a Black Sea resort. The aircraft had to make an emergency landing in Rostov-on-Don, however, after its first officer was suddenly struck by a health issue.</p>
      <p>The cause of death is unclear but it is believed to have been a heart attack or blood clot. A source told <i>RIA Novosti</i> that the pilot had earlier complained about having chest pain.</p>
      <p>One of the passengers, Yelena Voronova, told <i>Channel 5</i> that prior to landing the crew announced on loudspeaker that a crew member was feeling bad.</p>
      <p>“A stewardess practically ran across the aisle. They later asked if there were any doctors on board and said they really needed them. Then they asked again,” she said.</p>
