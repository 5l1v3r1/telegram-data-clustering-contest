      <h1>Giant pandas Wang Wang and Fu Ni to stay in Adelaide until 2024 under new agreement</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:57:33+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/" target="_blank">ABC</a></address>
      <p>Giant pandas Wang Wang and Fu Ni will officially be staying at the Adelaide Zoo for another five years after a deal was clinched between the zoo and their Chinese owners.</p>
      <p>The deal with the China Wildlife Conservation Association comes after the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-07/giant-pandas-wang-wang-and-fu-ni-to-remain-at-adelaide-zoo/10979268">state government agreed to extend the pandas lease until at least 2024</a> earlier this year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-13/adelaide-zoo-pandas-not-pregnant/10806430">Despite high expectations the zoo would already be boasting the patter of tiny paws</a>, Wang Wang and Fu Ni have so far failed to produce offspring.</p>
      <p>However, with the extension officially signed on Sunday, zookeepers plan to continue breeding attempts for the pair, which has been described as a major tourism drawcard for South Australia.</p>
      <p>Zoos SA chief executive Elaine Bensted said the zoo was thrilled and was always positive a deal would go ahead.</p>
      <p>“The giant pandas are a huge drawcard, helping people to connect with nature and learn about this incredibly special species,” she said.</p>
      <p>“From young to old, everyone who visits our Bamboo Forest falls in love with Wang Wang and Fu Ni.</p>
      <p>“They are always a delight to watch, whether they’re exploring their habitat, laying in the sun, climbing trees or eating bamboo.”</p>
      <p>Under the new deal, the zoo will received funding from the state government to support the giant panda conservation.</p>
      <p>The money will go towards research and breeding programs in China in exchange for having the giant pandas in Adelaide, where they have been since 2009.</p>

      <h3>‘Pandamonium’ at Adelaide Zoo</h3>
      <p>Trade and Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham on Sunday said the next step would be to plan ahead for the future of Wang Wang and Fu Ni.</p>
      <p>“It sounds like there’ll be a little bit of ‘pandamonium’ here as Adelaide Zoo celebrates the fact that Fu Ni and Wang Wang are here to stay for the next five years,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said the financial support from the federal government over the past 10 years, and the state government for the next five would help the conservation program.</p>
      <p>“… the state has stepped up here to fill this void here in terms of making sure the funding is there for the deal with China,” he said.</p>
      <p>Premier Steven Marshall also welcomed the signing of the deal, despite his frustration at how long it is taking to produce cubs.</p>
      <p>He could not say how much the agreement would cost taxpayers, but said it was a better deal than previous arrangements.</p>
      <p>“They’re much loved, they bring lots of visitors to the zoo and hopefully, hopefully, we will see them have another panda some time in the future. We’ve been waiting a long time so far,” he said.</p>
      <h3>‘We remain hopeful every year’</h3>

      <p>Ms Bensted said the zoo did not to attempt to breed the giant pandas this year while the agreement was being negotiated.</p>
      <p>Instead, researchers collected valuable samples from female panda Fu Ni in a bid to help the program in the future.</p>
      <p>“That will all feed into the research and from Spring 2020 we will absolutely be giving our panda breeding program another go,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We would absolutely love to see a giant panda cub, the first one ever that would be born in Australia.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had five attempts. We remain hopeful every year.”</p>
      <p>Giant pandas only have a short yearly reproductive window of approximately 24 to 72 hours.</p>
