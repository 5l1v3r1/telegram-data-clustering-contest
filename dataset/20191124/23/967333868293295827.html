        <b>MADRID (Sputnik) - Spanish law enforcement agencies have seized a submarine with 3 tonnes of cocaine on board near the coast of the autonomous community of Galicia, the country's media reported on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the LaSexta TV channel, the 20-meter-long submarine, which arrived from South America, was spotted near the coast of Pontevedra province.</p>
      <p>Two of crew members were detained. During the police operation, the crew reportedly <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201812111070567660-two-pensioners-arresred-cruise-possesion-cocaine/">attempted to sink the vessel</a>. Now, law enforcement agencies are trying to lift it to the surface, Spanish government representative in Galicia Javier Losada told the Galician radio. The situation is complicated by bad weather conditions.</p>
      <blockquote>Another suspect is supposedly at large. Police do not rule out that the crew has managed to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201907161076266669-man-caught-hiding-cocaine-toupee/">get rid of part of the cargo</a>.</blockquote>
      <p>According to the Pais newspaper, the vessel came from Colombia, while those detained are Ecuadorian nationals.</p>
      <p>The La Voz de Galicia newspaper, in turn, reported that the vessel had arrived from Portugal.</p>
