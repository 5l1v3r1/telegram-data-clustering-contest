      <p>Three persons have been booked by the Pimpri-Chinchwad police for allegedly organising a bullock cart race, which is in violation of the Supreme Court order banning such races. Besides the violation of public order, the three have been booked under statute against cruelty on animals.</p>
      <p>An FIR in this regard has been registered at Alandi police station, according to which a bullock cart race was held in a forest area near Markal village on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Those booked have been identified as Pappu Haribhau Lokhande, Ajit Bhuse and Bhau Bhuse, all residents of Markal village in Khed taluka.</p>
      <p>Assistant Inspector Vinay Bahir of Alandi police station said, “Our teams are on round-the-clock patrolling duties for the ongoing festivities in Alandi temple. We received a call about a bullock cart race being held on a road in forest area from Markal village to Koyali village. As our team approached the place, we could see at least eight bullock carts participating in a race. But by the time we reached, the organisers and participants along with the bullock carts fled into the forest area. We have now launched a search for them. An offence was registered at the police station in the afternoon.”</p>
      <p>Bahir added, “The carts that were used were very small which made it easy for them to flee. There is a High Court order in place prohibiting the bullock cart races which was later upheld by the Supreme Court. The case has been registered for disobedience of order duly promulgated by public servant and relevant sections of of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.”</p>
