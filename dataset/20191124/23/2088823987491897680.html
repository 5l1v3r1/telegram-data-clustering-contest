      <p>This time the Buffalo Beauts made it all the way back against the National Women’s Hockey League Isobel Cup champion Minnesota Whitecaps.</p>
      <p>Taylor Accursi’s third-period hat trick, including the winning goal on the power play with 2:56 left, gave the Beauts a stirring 4-3 victory over Minnesota on Sunday at Northtown Center in Amherst.</p>
      <p>Buffalo trailed 2-0 after two periods and the margin was 3-0 when Jonna Curtis of the Whitecaps scored at 5:30 of the third.</p>
      <p>That’s when Accursi, who had two goals in the Buffalo rally from a 4-0 deficit before Minnesota held on for a 5-3 victory in the series opener on Saturday night, went to work.</p>
      <p>Accursi beat Whitecaps goalie Amanda Leveille at 8:10 after Corinne Buie led a Buffalo rush.</p>
      <p>The Beauts narrowed the margin to one just 22 seconds later when Erin Gehen tipped home a long shot by Iveta Klimasova on the power play.</p>
      <p>Accursi tied it with 7:07 left with a shot into the top corner.</p>
      <p>Buie set up Accursi for the winning goal, at the side of the net, on the power play to complete the comeback and moved Buffalo (4-4-1-0, 10 points) back into second place ahead of the Whitecaps (4-3-0-1, 9 points) and behind the Boston Pride (9-0-0-0, 18) in the standings.</p>
      <p>Accursi credited the Beauts’ ability to come back on energy left over from Saturday.</p>
      <p>“I think today we had a way better first period,” she said. “I think that was a result of our momentum from yesterday’s second and third periods. We really took that into today. Our second period slowed us down because of penalties, but we were really able to pick it up in the third period today and get the win.”</p>
      <p>Accursi was an easy choice as the game’s first star. Beauts goalie Mariah Fujimagari was the second star. She stopped 39 shots in a game where Buffalo was outshot, 42-29.</p>
      <p>“I think, overall, it just goes to show the character in this locker room,” Fujimagari said. “I think even more than the two points, it shows how relentless we are, and how we don’t just play for the scoreboard, we don’t play for the time — we just continue to play our game, and we stick to our fundamentals. When we do, we have success.”</p>
      <p>The Beauts’ next game is on the road against the Connecticut Whale at the Danbury, Conn., Ice Arena at 4:30 p.m. on Saturday.</p>
