      <h1>Sean Payton Takes Shot At Refs Over Pass Interference Review</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:17:49+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:17</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>The New Orleans Saints may have walked away with a win on Sunday, but Sean Payton was not happy.</p>
      <p>The Saints head coach took a shot at officials over a pass interference review at the end of Sunday’s win over the Carolina Panthers that went against his New Orleans Saints.</p>
      <p>The Saints and Panthers were tied at 31 late, with Carolina having the ball with a 3rd-and-goal from the five. Panthers challenged a play in hopes of getting an incompletion overturned to a pass interference.</p>
      <p>We’ve seen worse plays not get overturned, yet the refs came back to do just that and gave the Panthers a fresh set of downs.</p>
      <p>Panthers kicker Joey Slye would go on to miss a chip shot and the Saints drove and kicked a field goal to win it 34-31.</p>
      <p>After the game, Payton let the refs know he was upset.</p>

      <p>The New York part is in direct reference to the NFL’s replay center in New York, where challenges are reviewed.</p>
      <p>It’s just kind of messed up that the league overturned a pass interference call in New Orleans when they couldn’t even get a PI call during the playoffs last year that cost them a chance at advancing to the Super Bowl.</p>
