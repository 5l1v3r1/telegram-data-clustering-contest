      <p>The Speaker, House of Representatives, Mr. Femi Gbajabiamila, has advised pupils to shun cultism, drug abuse and truancy if they want to progress and live a fulfilled life.</p>
      <p>Stressing the importance of education, the Speaker said: “I am where I am today because of God favour, but I will not be in this position if I didn’t go to school.”</p>
      <p>Gbajabiamila spoke in Lagos yesterday at the closing ceremony of a two-day education and health intervention for 5,000 secondary school pupils in Surulere 1 Federal Constituency.</p>
      <p>It was organised by Gbaja Professional Volunteers, a group of professionals promoting community development.</p>
      <p>The pupils benefitted from free medical services on eyes and dental screening, free eye glasses and free treatment of common skin disorders.</p>
      <p>Gbajabiamila, who relived his teaching experience, said:  “When I go round the schools to teach the children, I make it a point of duty to address certain things away from academics. I never hesitate to talk to children about drugs, being out of school, cultism and those things that will get them nowhere. I always tell them that it is important that they continue to imbibe the culture of going to school regularly, staying away from drugs. They should beware of teenage pregnancy and beware of cultism.”</p>

      <p>On the impact of his teaching, the Speaker said he was usually fulfilled even if he could change the life of one pupil.</p>
      <p>“I am glad to say that when I get feedback from parents of those pupils who ordinarily tried to stay away from schools, but after motivating them in the class, they are the ones that wake up early before their parents to tell them it is time to go to school, I feel fulfilled, I feel accomplished.”</p>
      <p>He told the pupils: “I want you to take it seriously that education is not for the sake of education, it is for the sake of progressive life. I want to advise you to take it seriously. I want to come back in 20 years from now, I want to see those pupils I have taught have become lawyers, doctors, engineers, members of House of Representatives, senators, and governors in their respective states. It is not a pipe dream, you can achieve it, that is my belief and I am sure that is your belief as well.”</p>
      <p>Gbajabiamila hailed the organisers for including health initiatives in the programme.</p>
      <p>He said: “It is only healthy children that can be educated. I have heard of people who have simple toothache that has led to paralysis and even death. It is only a healthy nation that can make progress. We will continue to do this. It is a continuous project. We will continue to engage our children so that we can preserve their future and the future of Nigeria.”</p>
