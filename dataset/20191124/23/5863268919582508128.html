      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:34:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:34</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>LAHORE (Web Desk) - Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) President Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday criticised the statement of U.S. Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Alice Wells about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).</p>
      <p>Shehbaz Sarif said US envoy Alice Wells  statement about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) showed her ignorance of the project.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter, Shehbaz said that his party rejected Wells  criticism and dubbed it  ill-founded . "As someone who was closely associated with negotiation process, I must say that CPEC envisions a community of shared interests," he tweeted.</p>

      <p>Wells had said that the lack of transparency in the CPEC projects would foster corruption and put more burden on Pakistan s economy.</p>
      <p>Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Yao Jing affirmed that Pakistan-China relations have been based on win-win cooperation and are mutually beneficial for both nations.</p>
      <p>While addressing the 5th CPEC Media Forum in Islamabad, he expressed astonishment over Alice Wells’ statement of higher tariff in power plants, established under the corridor.</p>
      <p>“In 2013, when the Chinese companies were establishing power plants in Pakistan, where was the U.S.?” the ambassador questioned.</p>
      <p>“Why the U.S. had not invested in Pakistan’s power sector despite knowing that Pakistan was in dire need of electricity?” he asked.</p>
      <p>He said China has always come forward to assist Pakistan in need without any political or government differences.</p>
      <p>“If Pakistan is in need, China will never ask it to repay its loans in time, whereas, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which is mainly governed by the West is strict in its repayment system.</p>
      <p>Under the CPEC, he said China would provide industrial cooperation to Pakistan and for this purpose over two dozen leading Chinese and Pakistani manufacturers and industrialists were engaged to boost production and exports of Pakistan.</p>
      <p>“Media is a major vehicle of information and platform of interaction […] media from both Pakistan and China have already been playing role in promoting state-to-state relations.”</p>
      <p>Ambassador Yao said he was “shocked and surprised” at Ms Wells’ speech which “fully exposes her ignorance of Pakistan-China relations”.</p>
      <p>He categorically rejected her statement of higher tariff in power plants, established under CPEC, saying that he himself had earlier briefed her about the tariff structure of these power plants and told that the tariff structure was the lowest among all the countries to whom the Chinese companies provide electricity.</p>
      <p>With respect to the US’ allegation of corruption in CPEC projects, Yao Jing said it was easy to allege anyone without having evidences.</p>
