      <h1>Watch: Did Cowboys QB Dak Prescott snub Jason Garrett on sideline?</h1>

      <p>The Dallas Cowboys got off to a rough start against the New England Patriots on Sunday, and a video that surfaced made it seem like Cowboys QB Dak Prescott may have taken out some of his frustrations on coach Jason Garrett.</p>
      <p>Prescott was jogging to the sideline in the first half just before the Cowboys punted the ball, and a clapping Garrett stuck his hand out to give the quarterback a high-five. </p>
      <p>Prescott ran right past him.</p>

      <p>In all likelihood, Prescott simply didn’t see Garrett. For starters, Garrett stuck his hand out at the last second. Then there was the weather element, as it was about 40 degrees and pouring ran. Prescott had his hands tucked inside his hand warmer and looked like he wanted to get inside that jacket as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>All that said, the exchange — or lack thereof — was noteworthy for a lot of people because there was a similar situation earlier in the year when it seemed like several defensive players completely ignored Garrett. </p>
      <p>That video was a bit more concerning and came late in a game when the Cowboys were losing to the New York Jets.</p>

      <p>There’s no reason to think Prescott would give Garrett that treatment.</p>
