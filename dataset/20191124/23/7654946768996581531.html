      <p>Defense Secretary Mark Esper canned Navy Secretary Richard Spencer over his handling of the internal disciplinary review of SEAL Eddie Gallagher.</p>
      <p>Esper asked Spencer to resign after discovering that the Navy secretary had privately told the White House that if it did not intervene in Gallagher’s case, Spencer would make sure Gallagher would be able to retire and keep his Trident pin that designates him as an elite warrior, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2019/11/24/pentagon-chief-asks-navy-secretarys-resignation-over-private-proposal-navy-seals-case/">The Washington Post reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Spencer did not inform Esper of the proposal during a number of conversations and contradicted his public stand on how Gallagher’s review should proceed.</p>
      <p>Esper said he was “deeply troubled by his conduct.”</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, as a result I have determined that Secretary Spencer no longer has my confidence to continue in his position,” Esper said in a statement. “I wish Richard well.”</p>
      <p>Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said Spencer submitted his resignation.</p>
      <p>Esper learned of Spencer’s offer after meeting with President Trump on Friday, a day after the commander-in-chief tweeted that the Navy “will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher’s Trident Pin.”</p>
      <p>Spencer reached out to Trump before he posted the tweet.</p>
      <p>The Navy began the process to boot the SEAL after Gallagher was found not guilty last July of murdering an Islamic State military member while deployed to Iraq in 2017. But he was convicted for posing with the terrorist’s corpse.</p>
      <p>Gallagher earlier Sunday thanked President Trump for <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/trump-says-navy-seal-edward-gallagher-wont-lose-commando-unit-pin/">intervening in his war crimes case</a> and said top brass in the elite commando unit are retaliating against him.</p>
      <p>“I’m overjoyed he stepped in again, being the leader he is,” <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/navy-seal-eddie-gallagher-says-hes-being-retaliated-against-in-war-crimes-case/">Gallagher told “Fox &amp; Friends.”</a> “It’s all about retaliation.”</p>
