      <p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a>, one of the main reasons that the brand is so beloved is the commentary team. <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/mauro-ranallo">Mauro Ranallo</a>, Nigel McGuinness, and Beth Phoenix are considered the best announce team in the company, and it's easy to see why.</p>
      <p>With the insights from two legendary performers and a third man who many have compared to Good Ol' Jim Ross, the trio is able to both inform and entertain viewers throughout the night.</p>
      <p>Last night was no different, with the NXT commentary desk delivering some great lines at War Games. However, Ranallo himself received some criticism from colleague <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/corey-graves">Corey Graves</a>. It seemed that Graves was hinting that Ranallo may have been overdoing it, not giving McGuinness or Phoenix a chance to get a word in.</p>

      <p>Along with that, Graves chimed in when a fan brought up the Chicago specific references that the Bipolar Rock'n'Roller was dropping throughout the night. It was a bit much, for Graves, it seemed.</p>

      <p>As far as what Ranallo thinks about Graves and his comments, it looks like we won't be getting that answer. At some point, Ranallo deleted his Twitter account. This left fans aggravated with Graves, as you can see by the responses from his tweets.</p>
      <p>Frank Shamrock, a close friend of Ranallo's, even responded, believing that Graves was disrespecting the NXT commentator.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Whether or not Ranallo and Graves have heat with one another is unknown. Graves has been known to comment without fear of repercussions in the past, and he could've just been casually speaking his mind without any ill-will towards Ranallo.</p>
