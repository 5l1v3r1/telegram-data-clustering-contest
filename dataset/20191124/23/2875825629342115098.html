      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity's</a> new camp leader apparently has a sassy side.</p>
      <p>Rugby legend <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/james-haskell">James Haskell</a> snapped back at Geordie duo Ant &amp; Dec after they asked him what had happened during tonight's live Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>Tonight saw most of the campmates take on the live trial, with the majority of them winning a roast dinner.</p>
      <p>However, since James and Roman Kemp failed to win their stars, Ian Wright, Cliff Parisi and Andy Whyment would all have to make do with some rice.</p>
      <p>The trial, based on another of ITV's reality smashes Love Island, saw the famous faces take on a number of challenges, which included downing blended vomit fruit and finding a star in a pot of mealworms using only the mouth.</p>

      <p>James and Roman had to reach into boxes filled with all sorts of critters and unscrew their stars - but they didn't get them in time, meaning three of their pals wouldn't be getting their roast.</p>
      <p>The pair made their way back to the others with heavy hearts and their heads hanging low.</p>
      <p>"That was unlucky," said Dec, "What was it, James?"</p>
      <p>A disgruntled James came back: "What was it?!</p>

      <p>"The very fact that there was a giant crab in the way that you wanted me to carefully caress in a different direction while I was trying to unscrew a star in its face."</p>
      <p>Dec mocked: "Alright, somebody's getting a bit prickly!"</p>
      <p>"The competitive spirit!" James laughed.</p>

      <p>Tonight's episode saw tensions reach a fever pitch as camp drama queen Andrew Maxwell clashed twice with different people.</p>
      <p>One saw him slam the camp as "shambolic" after he didn't think they'd properly discussed the answer to a question that could win them a treat.</p>
      <p>He hugged it out with James after they had a spat, saying: "I said my piece, everyone said their piece and big James gave me a hug, job done."</p>
      <p>James headed to the Bush Telegraph to confide: "Everyone's tired, everyone's a bit chippy, everyone's had a long day, things happen.</p>
      <p>"I'm just mortified if he thinks I just closed him down."</p>
      <p>Another argument saw the comedian accuse Ian Wright of shouting at him, before they too hugged it out and Andrew threatened to let the waterworks flow again.</p>
