      <h1>CoverGirl's New $8 Mascara Is Ideal For Anyone Who Wants a "No-Makeup" Makeup Look</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T23:20:03+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 23:20</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Siegel</a></address>
      <p>There's a lot that beauty-lovers hope for from <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Best-Mascaras-46178462">mascaras</a>, but those dreams can be instantly ruined if the formula is too thick or goopy, looking more like tar on your lashes than makeup. If the idea of a single clump sends shivers down your spine, CoverGirl just created a new mascara you'll be thankful for.</p>
      <p>The new <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/buy/CoverGirl-Exhibitionist-Uncensored-Mascara-518680?url_pos=body-url&amp;p_name=CoverGirl%20Exhibitionist%20Uncensored%20Mascara&amp;retailer=target.com&amp;pid=518680&amp;price=8&amp;evar1=bella%3Aus&amp;evar3=article%3Agallery-one&amp;evar9=46908001&amp;evar98=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2Fbeauty%2Fcovergirl-exhibitionist-uncensored-mascara-review-46908001&amp;list1=covergirl%2Cmascara%2Cmakeup%2Cbeauty%20review%2Cnewsletter&amp;prop13=desktop&amp;page_name=bella%3Aus%3Aarticle%3Acovergirl-exhibitionist-uncensored-mascara-review-46908001&amp;pdata=17359799">CoverGirl Exhibitionist Uncensored Mascara</a> ($8) is a dream for lovers of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/-Makeup-Makeup-Foundation-Experiment-46406786">natural-looking makeup</a>. It's formulated with coconut and jojoba oils, which means it hydrates your lashes while you're wearing it. When I first tried it, I was relieved to see that the spoolie wand coated every single one of my lashes in a dark black pigment. The formula is easy to build on, too â€” even with the multitude of layers I applied, it never looked clumped. In fact, the mascara just made it look like I was born with really dark, defined, envy-inducing eyelashes.</p>
      <p>Another perk? It will not smear or flake. There's nothing worse to me than when a mascara starts flaking off, creating a flurry of black dots beneath my eyes. I spend quite a lot of time <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Best-Under-Eye-Concealers-6854911?">brightening up</a> that area, so it infuriates me when a mascara ruins it. Luckily this product stays put all day, allowing my eye makeup to look as good as when I first applied it.</p>
      <p>While I might prefer a more dramatic mascara for the evening, this pick is ideal for workdays and weekends when I just want a little bit extra definition to my eyes, without looking like I have a lot of makeup on. Check out the mascara ahead.</p>
