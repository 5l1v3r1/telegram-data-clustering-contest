      <p>"This is great news for a lucky player in Offaly to wake up to this morning and Birr is certainly having its rub of the green of late," said a National Lottery spokesperson.</p>
      <p>"We are asking all our players all across the country, especially those who play in Birr, Co. Offaly, to check their tickets carefully in-store or by scanning the ticket’s barcode using the National Lottery App. If you are this lucky winner be sure to sign the back of the ticket and call the National Lottery claims team on 01 836 4444 and we will arrange for you to collect your prize."</p>
