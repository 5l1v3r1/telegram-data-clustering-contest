        <li>The US wants to secure a trade deal with China by year's end but can't overlook violence in Hong Kong, a senior official has said.</li>
        <li>"We're not going to turn a blind eye to what's happening in Hong Kong," Robert O'Brien, the head of the National Security Agency, said Saturday.</li>
        <li>Donald Trump <a href="https://www.insider.com/trumps-response-to-hong-kong-protests-2019-11">said on Friday he warned Chinese President Xi Jinping</a> that suppressing protests wil have "a tremendous negative impact" on attempts to end the trade war, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-war-us-china-tariffs-lost-no-meaning-2019-11?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=ingest">now into its 16th month.</a></li>

      <p>The US wants to ink a trade deal with China by the end of 2019, but can't overlook violence in Hong Kong, the head of the National Security Agency has said.</p>
      <p>"We were hoping to have deal done by the end of the year. I still think that's possible," Robert O'Brien said <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trade-china/still-hope-for-u-s-china-deal-this-year-u-s-official-idUKKBN1XX0L6">during a security conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"At the same time, we're not going to turn a blind eye to what's happening in Hong Kong or what's happening in the South China Sea, or other areas of the world where we're concerned about China's activity."</p>
      <p>O'Brien, Donald Trump's fourth security advisor, said it "would be a good sign" if Sunday's local elections in Hong Kong passed without clashes between pro-democracy protesters and police. </p>

      <p>Trump <a href="https://www.insider.com/trumps-response-to-hong-kong-protests-2019-11">says he has warned Chinese President Xi Jinping</a> that suppressing protests in Hong Kong wil have "a tremendous negative impact" on attempts to end the trade war, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-war-us-china-tariffs-lost-no-meaning-2019-11?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=ingest">now into its 16th month.</a></p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/donald-trump-fox-and-friends-interview-transcript-trump-interviewed-after-impeachment-hearings">Fox &amp; Friends</a> on Friday, Trump said that if it weren't for him, "Hong Kong would have been obliterated in 14 minutes."</p>
      <p>He said that Xi had "a million soldiers standing outside of Hong Kong that aren't going in only because I asked him, 'please don't do that.'"</p>

      <p>Trump also said he could veto bipartisan US legislation, passed on Wednesday, that outlined support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, suggesting it will anger China and derail trade talks.</p>
      <p>"We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I'm also standing with President Xi. He's a friend of mine, an incredible guy."</p>
