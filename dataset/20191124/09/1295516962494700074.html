      <p>Concept art from the final fight in <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/avengers-endgame/">Avengers: Endgame</a><i> </i>displays the lumbering gorilla Chitauri in high resolution for the first time.</p>
      <p>Featuring a significant amount of detail and featuring the designs from multiple angles, Marvel concept artist Jerad S. Marantz posted up-close shots of the beasts to his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5IlKughg_3/">Instagram</a>. With the images, Marantz shared, "Funny story, I was in between characters on Spiderman Far from Home and got this assignment. They were rethinking this character/creature in the final battle in #endgame and needed a new design...I got it approved in the first pass. It was really exciting to work on #endgame again after so much time."</p>

      <p>Describing the pictures, which feature the gorilla Chitauri's advanced armor, Marantz noted, "I’m not sure how this guy fits in the alien race, he’s either a less involved version of the #Chitauri or some genetically modified version for battle."</p>
      <p>We also recently got a look at <a href="https://www.cbr.com/mcu-baby-thanos-concept-art/">concept art for baby Thanos</a> along with versions of the Mad Titan as a teenager. Given the scope of the massive MCU film, expect a lot more discarded concepts and detailed looks at elements from the movie to continue pouring in.</p>
      <p>Directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> stars Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Brie Larson as Captain Marvel, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, Don Cheadle as War Machine, Karen Gillan as Nebula, Danai Gurira as Okoye and Bradley Cooper as Rocket, with Gwyneth Paltrow Pepper Potts, Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Benedict Wong as Wong, Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie and Josh Brolin as Thanos.
