      <p>Reports in Italy claimed that the Italian striker was involved in alleged bust-up with head coach Fabio Grosso on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>It is believed that Gross told Balotelli to leave as he was not impressed with the striker's attitude during the session.</p>
      <p>The Brescia president claims he has not had any contact with the head coach, but he does feel Balotelli has not been happy since the Verona game where he was racially abused by the fans.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t there,” Cellino told Gazzetta dello Sport.</p>
      <p>“Grosso didn’t call me; I have to assume that there aren’t any problems. Anyway, Mario hasn’t been smiling since Verona.”</p>
      <p>Verona are yet to be punished for their supporters' behaviour on November 3, after the initial stand closure ban was suspended, pending furthr investigation.</p>
