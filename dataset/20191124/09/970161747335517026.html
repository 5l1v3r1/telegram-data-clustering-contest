      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/patrice-evra/">Patrice Evra</a> was a captivated spectator when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michael-venom-page/">Michael Venom Page</a> took less than two minutes to knock out Giovanni Melillo at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bellator/">Bellator</a> London on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> legend met MVP for the first time before the fight and watched his new friend in action in the main event at the SSE Wembley Arena.</p>
      <p>Page dominated Melillo from the first bell and stopped his opponent with a quick overhand right in the first round.</p>
      <p>Evra was watching the action unfold on TV and released a hilarious blow-by-blow account of the fight on his Instagram story.</p>

      <p>‘Couldn’t come to the fight but I’m watching it on TV. Make it quick, I’m tired, I need to go to sleep,’ Evra said as MVP made his entrance.</p>
      <p>After the British welterweight made short work of Melillo, Evra celebrated MVP’s latest victory .</p>

      <p>He said: ‘Bro what’s wrong with you, man? What’s wrong with you? Let me just hit my popcorn man. One punch.</p>
      <p>‘MVP is too much, you have to stop man. Wow, that’s it. There we go. MVP, well done bro. I’m proud of you.’</p>
      <p>Page will now push ahead with his campaign to fight welterweight champion Douglas Lima following his win in London.</p>
      <p>Lima beat MVP in the welterweight grand prix earlier this year and sent a message to his rival.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Solid performance Michael Page. But I need to see wins against ranked opponents then you know where I’ll be.’</p>
