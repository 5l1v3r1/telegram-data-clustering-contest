      </p>
      <p>Three people were confirmed dead on the spot while four others were rushed to hospital in critical condition following a tragic road accident along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway.</p>
      <p>Reports indicate that all the casualties as well as the deceased are members of the same family.</p>
      <p>The accident occurred after a trailer rammed into the rear of a personal car that was ferrying the occupants from Nakuru to Nairobi.</p>
      <p>Upon the impact, the car crashed into another trailer ahead of it.</p>
      <p>Among the dead in the Saturday night accident are two women and a six-year-old boy.</p>
      <p>The accident which happened near Marula farm in Naivasha saw transport along the busy road temporarily paralyzed.</p>
      <p>Police and well-wishers moved in to rush the injured to hospital and retrieve the bodies from the wreck before the wreck was towed away.</p>
      <p>The incident was confirmed by Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru who stated that the injured are admitted to Naivasha sub-county hospital in serious but stable condition with the bodies of the deceased moved to a morgue within the same facility.</p>
      <p>“Initial investigations point to the driver of the last trailer for the accident which claimed three lives and he shall be charged in court once investigations are through,” he said.</p>
      <p>A witness who arrived at the scene shortly after the accident recounted that the personal car was squeezed between the two trailers killing the three and seriously injuring others.</p>
