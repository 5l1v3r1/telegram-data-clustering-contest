      <h2>The defense earns high marks for its dominating performance</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.heraldnet.com/author/npatterson/" target="_blank">Nick Patterson</a></address>
      <p>Here’s how the Seattle Seahawks grade out in their <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=401128008">17-9 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles</a> on Sunday at Lincoln Financial Field:</p>
      <p>
        <b>OFFENSE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Seattle’s offense left a lot of points on the field in this one. Quarterback Russell Wilson missed a wide-open Jacob Hollister in the end zone and DK Metcalf dropped a touchdown pass, preventing the Seahawks from creating distance. Indeed, Wilson was short of his usual MVP self against a Philadelphia defense that came into the game playing excellent football. However, running back Rashaad Penny stepped up at just the right time, rushing for 129 yards and scoring on a 58-yard run that essentially ended the game.</p>
      <p><b>Grade:</b> C</p>
      <p>
        <b>DEFENSE</b>
      </p>
      <p>This was an superb performance by Seattle’s defense as the Seahawks forced five Philadelphia turnovers, with those coming every time the Eagles were threatening to move the ball. Seattle was able to get pressure on Philadelphia quarterback Carson Wentz, registering three sacks and nine quarterback hits despite the absence of defensive end Jadeveon Clowney because of a hip injury. The only Eagles touchdown came with 20 seconds remaining as the Seahawks went into a prevent defense and more or less conceded the score.</p>
      <p><b>Grade:</b> A</p>
      <p>
        <b>SPECIAL TEAMS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both place-kicker Jason Myers and punter Michael Dickson seemed to be affected by the windy conditions at the start, but both adjusted well as the game progressed and performed their jobs flawlessly the rest of the way. Dickson in particular was effective at pinning the Eagles deep inside their own territory, with Ugo Amadi providing the highlights in coverage as he twice downed punts inside the 2-yard line.</p>
      <p><b>Grade:</b> B+</p>
      <p>
        <b>COACHING</b>
      </p>
      <p>This was a well-schemed game by the Seahawks, particularly on defense where the coaches recognized the Eagles’ lack of offensive weapons. Philadelphia tight end Zach Ertz, the only real threat available, was regularly double-teamed and rendered a non-factor until Philadelphia’s final drive. On offense, the Seahawks showed creativity, as Seattle went to a trick play at just the right time to score its first touchdown on a throwback pass, and the coaches were rewarded for showing faith in Penny. The soft defense at the end made the final score closer than it should have been.</p>
      <p><b>Grade:</b> B+</p>
      <p>
        <b>OVERALL</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Seahawks are completely unfazed by going on the road. Seattle is now 6-0 on the road this season, and Sunday was the fourth time this season the Seahawks flew to the Eastern time zone, played what was for them a morning game, and emerged victorious. But perhaps the most important development was the continued progress made by the defense. If the Seahawks can get that straightened out, they’ll make themselves legitimate championship contenders.</p>
      <p><b>Grade:</b> B+</p>
