      <p>At a truck stop in Laramie, Wyoming is a you-won't-believe-it situation from the world of trucker cuisine. "If you'd bet me, I would have bet $100 there'd be no decent food of any kind in here," said one customer. And she would've lost that bet.</p>
      <p>Just off Exit 290 on I-80, the Indian food that Mintu Pandher and his staff are cooking up in this small kitchen guarantees that.</p>
      <p>"This smells like we're in Mumbai, not in Laramie," said correspondent Jim Axelrod.</p>

      <p>Just a few feet away from the motor oil, the military hats, and trucker shirts are storage shelves full of fresh turmeric, coriander, and other spices maybe you haven't heard of.</p>
      <p>Pandher explained, "This is a leaf, it's called kasuri methi – I mean, if you start putting this on, you will not eat anything without it!"</p>
      <p>There's a rice steamer with no off-switch, an always-full pot of chai, and the soul of any Indian kitchen: a clay oven, the tandoor. "The tandoor, the flavor goes in the meat, not out of the meat," said Pandher. "Like, if you put on a grill, everything kind of drips down. This way the heat is all around, it's surrounded by the heat."</p>
      <p>When Pandher bought this truck stop in 2014, it came with a griddle for hot dogs and hamburgers. But figuring truckers could get those up and down I-80, he went with a menu they wouldn't find anywhere else.</p>
      <p>Axelrod asked, "Do they ever come in and say, 'All you got's Indian food, and I want meatloaf, I want a hamburger, I want a strip steak'?"</p>
      <p>"So then, we tell 'em, 'Hey, try this. You're gonna have that on the next stop anyway,'" Pandher replied. "99 out of 100, they would call again: 'Hey, I want somethin' what I ate last time. That stuff was delicious. I want that meal. I don't know what it was named, but this guy, he gave it to me. I think it's number 29!'"</p>

      <p>From cross-country truckers ("I don't know how to rate it." "One to ten?" "I'd say it's probably, you know, a good nine!") to locals, like Sheriff's Deputy Bill Yates ("If this is the area I'm patrolling, I know where I'm gonna stop to eat lunch"), Pandher's food has been a hit.</p>
      <p>Deputy Yates is partial to both the yellow curry <i>and</i> the broader field of vision that comes with it.  "It's bringing the world here rather than keeping our world small," he said.</p>
      <p>Strictly speaking, the restaurant accounts for a small part of Pandher's revenue, but that's not how he speaks – or thinks. "I would say 5% to 10% at the most, 10%," he said.</p>
      <p>"So, why bother?" Axelrod asked.</p>
      <p>"This is not a whole picture with the food. So, they would come in and spend rest $500, $600 on fuel because they know they can get their meal they desire from last 800 miles here."</p>

      <p>He's opened another spot in Nebraska, and will soon add a third in New Mexico. Turns out there's some money in all those smells and tastes, especially with the changing face of trucking, since nearly 19% of long-haul truck drivers in America are now immigrants.</p>
      <p>Axelrod asked, "No surprise for you that you can recreate all that stuff in the middle of a truck stop on I-80?"</p>
      <p>"Well, that was the plan," Pandher said. "So we succeeded."</p>
      <p>All it took was for Mintu Pandher to trust his gut – and those of hungry truckers driving by.</p>
