        <b>Champion jockey Oisin Murphy added another notable victory to his CV as he claimed the Japan Cup aboard Suave Richard.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Murphy has enjoyed a landmark year, being crowned top jockey for the first time, and he teamed up with the Yasushi Shono-trained five-year-old in the Tokyo Group One.</p>
      <p>Suave Richard was sitting in third at the top of the straight in the 12-furlong contest, but switched to the rail by Murphy, the son of Deep Impact found an extra burst to grab the lead.</p>
      <p>Murphy's mount went on to win by three-quarters of a length with Curren Bouquetd'or second and Wagnerian third.</p>
      <p>Frankie Dettori, William Buick and Ryan Moore also had rides in the race, but they all finished down the field.</p>
