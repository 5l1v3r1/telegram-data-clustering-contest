      <h1>REVIEW: South Africa safari will blow you away</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:00:30+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Beresford</a></address>
      <p>If you have been following our South Africa review, you’ll have read last week all about our 220km trip from Cape Town to Swellendam in the Western Cape.<br/>It was a four-day journey that saw us take in sights like Table Mountain in Cape Town to Marloth Nature Reserve in Swellendam as well as a marine safari in Gansbaai.<br/>And while that was all absolutely incredible, the best was still to come.<br/>I briefly mentioned Mossel Bay in my previous article (which can be found now up on www.buzz.ie) — a harbour town situated along the Garden Route and one which I claimed was my favourite spot we stopped at thus far on our trip<br/>It’s most famously known for the 19th-century Cape St. Blaize Lighthouse, which offers spectacular bay views, and Santos Beach which looks out onto crystal clear waters.<br/>Mossel Bay is absolutely worth stopping at on any drive along the Garden Route — in fact, it’s where most people begin their journey of the route and once you visit, it is very easy to see why.<br/>From Mossel Bay we headed towards Wilderness where we enjoyed lunch at Salinas Beach Restaurant (www.salinas.co.za/). With an outdoor terrace that looks out onto the beach, we spent the afternoon dolphin-spotting while tucking into a delicious fish lunch, including calamari, prawns and my personal favourite, the fish tacos.</p>

      <p>The food here is only beaten by the views of what is probably the most pristine Blue Flag beach I have ever sunk my toes onto.<br/>With our bellies full, we took a stroll along the white sands before jumping back into the car for our next stop.<br/>Our final destination on Day 5 was Knysna — a stunning town which roughly marks the midway point, or ‘the heartbeat of’, the Garden Route — but no drive to Knysna can be undertaken without at least three stops along the way.<br/>We had already stopped at Mossel Bay and Wilderness, but our final stop before reaching Knysna was about to be my favourite yet.<br/>Owners Paul Theron and Elmay Bouwer, of Blackwaters River Lodge (www.blackwaters.co.za), boast that their luxury accommodation is “a place of magic” and it is impossible to disagree.<br/>Tucked away in a valley on the banks of the Goukamma River, this hotel is set among perfectly-manicured gardens surrounded by indigenous forest — we even saw wildlife as we enjoyed a picnic on the grounds looking out at what can only be described as paradise.<br/>At Blackwaters River Lodge, there is 20 beautifully-decorated rooms, including 12 luxury suites with private balconies and eight classic suites with private patios.<br/>If you enjoy activities, Blackwaters have you covered — the accommodation is set on a pristine par-3 golf course while you can also stand-up paddleboard along the tranquil waters, which we did, with Tripout (www.tripout.co.za).<br/>After we arrived back on dryland, we enjoyed a glass of bubbles (you become very accustomed to this in South Africa!) and a picnic as we took in our incredible surroundings.<br/>As far as hotel views go, they don’t get better than those on offer at Blackwaters River Lodge.<br/>After our picnic, we headed to our guesthouse, the Hide Away Guest House (www.hideaway.co.za), owned by Cecil and Colleen who are a wealth of Knysna knowledge.<br/>Don’t let the name fool you though, while the Hide Away is quiet and peaceful, it is just 1.5 kilometres from the centre of town, Knysna waterfront and the absolutely picturesque Thesen Island.<br/>After we settled into our spacious rooms, with views overlooking the water, we headed for dinner at The Drydock Food Company (www.drydock.co.za).<br/>This lagoon side restaurant is situated right on the water’s edge and serves the best pesto pasta I’ve ever tasted — including on a visit to Italy!<br/>I wasn’t quite brave enough to try Dry Dock’s speciality of oysters — which are served both wild and cultivated — but the food I did indulge in here was some of the best I had tried yet.<br/>The Malva pudding dessert, which is native to South Africa, at Dry Dock is an absolute must. It is essentially what we know here in Ireland as sticky toffee pudding but it is so delicious, alone it is worth the air miles for another.<br/>After dinner, we enjoyed a little wander around the harbour before heading back for a good night’s sleep ahead of our first full day in Knysna.<br/>Waking up the following morning, I was excited for what lay ahead, as we were about to see two opposite sides of the Knysna coin.<br/>In the morning, we headed on a township tour with our guide Anita Best, of Hashtag Tours, who herself is from the township.<br/>I was stunned to learn that, with a population of 79,000 people in Knysna (according to the last Census), 49,000 of these live in the township.<br/>Within the township — which was gutted in 2017 from fires which ripped through Knysna — there are three primary schools and two secondary schools.<br/>The main language here is Kosa, while the majority of the locals also speak English.<br/>There are many nationalities here, also, including Ghanaian, Nigerian and Somalian, and plenty of different types of businesses, too.<br/>We visited ‘Joe the Cobbler’, who sells his own shoes, purses, keyrings and other quality keepsakes, before heading for the library, where I was pleasantly surprised to pick up wifi.<br/>Afterwards, I was left grinning from ear to ear when we visited one of the local creches, where the children sang for us, including the South African national anthem. There is an incredible sense of community in these townships where absolutely nobody is left fending for themselves.<br/>Our next stop was just two kilometres from here, where we were about to see the flipside of that coin on a walking tour with Mandy from Knysna Hike and Bike (www.knysnahikeandbike.co.za).<br/>We strolled across to Thesen Island, which is what retirement dreams are surely made of — beautiful, quiet and relaxed.</p>

      <p>The place itself looks like it jumped off of a postcard while the Turbine Boutique Hotel (www.turbinehotel.co.za) is a perfect example of when 5* luxury meets retro modernity.<br/>We tucked into burgers at The Exchange (www.exchangegrill.co.za) before getting our thrills with Scootours Knysna (www.scootours.co.za) in Knysna Forest National Park.<br/>Scootours seem, at first, a terrifying mode of transport — you basically scoot down the park, rough terrain and all, picking up speed as you go downhill.<br/>Thankfully, our guides Brave (in name and nature) and Jeffrey let us go at our own speed — even if Brave went much, much faster than us.<br/>I’ll admit, I used my brake quite a bit to begin with, but once I got the hang of it, 40 minutes just didn’t seem like long enough.<br/>Later that night we had dinner at Blend Country Restaurant &amp; Pub, which is tucked away from the bustle of Knysna, with fairy lights leading the path to the door.<br/>Like I’ve said throughout, though, the best — and this time there can be no doubt! — was yet to come as the next morning we set off for Pumba Game Reserve.<br/>At 31, this was my first wildlife safari and I was beyond excited. My expectations, I feared, had been set too high, but when it comes to Pumba, your expectations are exceeded — and then some.<br/>You could go there, see none of the Big 5 (though, this won’t happen) — elephant, lion, leopard, buffalo and rhino — and yes, you’ll be a little disappointed, but you will still have had an experience to remember. That’s a testament to how impressive everything at Pumba is — from the stunning lodges to the wonderful staff.<br/>We saw four of the Big 5, spotting a leopard on the last of four game drives (there are two drives per day and you don’t want to sleep it out, or in, for any of them) before we left Pumba for Port Elizabeth Airport.<br/>And it was, put simply, a surreal experience. The leopard brushed past our jeep, slowly and calmly, as we sat in stunned silence just centimetres from an animal who, by its very nature, is bred to kill.<br/>But, while your heart definitely pumps, it is, dare I say it, a somewhat calming experience — almost an outer body one. It helps that we were in the safe hands of our ranger Cameron, whose complete lack of fear helped us relax from the get-go.<br/>While the leopard rounded off what was an incredible three days at Pumba, it was just one memory in a long line of spectacular ones.<br/>From coming so close to elephants that you could feel their breath on your neck to watching lions as they roamed in their natural habitat and having sundowners in the bush, every second in Pumba is one to treasure.<br/>Awaking each morning to the sounds of nature and the sun appearing on the horizon as the animals — mainly giraffes — made their way to the wells for a drink is an experience that you will simply never, ever forget.<br/>And each evening, as the guests gathered around the fire to discuss the animals we had seen, it was hard to be anything but thankful — not just for the spectacular time we were having but for the stunning animals that spend their lives roaming the wild. They are fighting a daily battle for survival, but they are happy — because the wild is where they belong.<br/>And being among that is the most special memory I have from my time in South Africa.</p>
