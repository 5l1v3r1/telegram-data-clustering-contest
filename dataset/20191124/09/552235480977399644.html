      <h1>Alan Brazil claims Celtic captain Scott Brown 'deserves' to play in Euro 2020 for Scotland</h1>
      <h2>The pundit is adamant that Scotland will be improved by the return of the Celtic captain.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:36:38+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:36</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Former Scotland and Manchester United star Alan Brazil has backed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-brown">Scott Brown</a> to return to the Scotland team.</p>
      <p>Brown retired from Scotland duty in August 2016 before reversing his decision three months later when answering an SOS from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/gordon-strachan">Gordon Strachan</a> .</p>
      <p>He drew a line under his international career for a second time in Febuary 2018 but recent comments have suggested a potential change of heart.</p>
      <p>Brown said: “They still have two games to get through but....you never say never.</p>
      <p>“It would be phenomenal to get to a finals after 22 years. I remember watching the games at France '98 as a 13-year-old and my mum put <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> flags all around the windows and outside in the street.</p>
      <p>“It was great and it shows you the whole country wants us to get back there again. The Tartan Army are great supporters, whether it’s at home or abroad and it would be good for them as well."</p>
      <p>And Brazil reckons that should be music to the ears of the Tartan Army because a player of Brown's quality deserves a chance to play to a major international tournament.</p>

      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.sundaypost.com/">Sunday Post</a> , he said: "I want to see Broony back in the national side.</p>
      <p>"I understand why people might be wary. The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> skipper has retired from international football twice now, and some will accuse him of more comebacks than Frank Sinatra.</p>
      <p>"He's also 34-years-old  and plays in an area of the park where Scotland are strong. But I don't think there is another Scottish midfielder that does the job Scott does.</p>
      <p>"He looks after the ball well. That goes without saying but is there another player with Broony's bite?</p>
      <p>"I don't think so and with the Euro 2020 play-offs coming up, that could be vital."</p>
      <p>He continued: "Can he do a job on the park? 100%.</p>
      <p>"So, for me, it's a no-brainer.</p>
      <p>"And I understand from Scott's perspective why he's open to the prospect of returning.</p>
      <p>"He's a player who deserves to play at a major international tournament."</p>
