      <p>James Forrest hit a double and he was joined by goals from Odsonne Edouard, now 14 from 25 games, and Scott Brown.</p>
      <p>Livingston beat<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/"> Celtic</a> last time round – but the nine-in-a-row chasing hosts have been absolutely rampant since then.</p>
      <p>It’s now five straight league victories, eighteen goals and <b>NONE</b> conceded.</p>
      <p>Celtic now also have a three-point lead ahead of <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> going to Hamilton on Sunday.</p>
      <p>And a further bonus – if it were needed – was the return to action of frontman Leigh Griffiths after a three-month lay-off.</p>

        <b>MAN OF THE MATCH</b>
      </p>
      <p>Celtic had a number of excellent performers. Livi produced next to nothing in attack but Christopher Jullien and Kris Ajer still set the tone for the champions by being utterly commanding. However, the top player for Celtic was unquestionably Jeremie Frimpong.</p>
      <p>The teenage right-back was magnificent. Electric pace, dazzling footwork and an end product. Defensively the Dutch youngster was always alert.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MAN IN THE MIDDLE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Andrew Dallas was possibly too lenient on Livi striker Lyndon Dykes in the early stages following a number of questionably challenges.</p>
      <p>But Dykes eventually got a card. Dallas also later booked sub Scott Tiffoney and Scott Brown.</p>
      <p>However, the whistler otherwise handled the game sensibly and with calm authority.</p>
      <p>It was hard to question many of his decisions as for once he emerged from a game relatively unscathed. Several times he also wisely opted for advantage than bring the game back for a free-kick.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MEN IN THE DUGOUT</b>
      </p>
      <p>Neil Lennon would’ve really savoured this win as revenge for what happened at the Tony Macaroni.</p>
      <p>Celtic properly dealt with the West Lothian side and Lennon would’ve been thrilled with his players’ attitude and some of their football.</p>
      <p>For Gary Holt it was another defeat but Livi’s season doesn’t rest on games against the Old Firm. However, they need to start winning again at some point.</p>
      <p>The Hoops wanted to tame the Lions as much as they’ve ever done following that shocking defeat in West Lothian.</p>
      <p>It’s easy to forget also that since that memorable October 6 result Livi have been woeful.</p>
      <p>Indeed, since the end of August they’ve managed just that one victory, with seven defeats going into the game.</p>
      <p>Parkhead is hardly a place to go for a club like Livi when seeking a morale-lifting outcome.</p>

      <p>But they were typically stuffy – a well drilled back four bolstered by a solid bank of four in front of them.</p>
      <p>And lone striker Lyndon Dykes wasn’t shy the whole match in putting himself about, especially irritating Hoops stopper Christopher Jullien with a number of late challenges which eventually got him booked.</p>
      <p>It was always going to be a frustrating game for the champions, requiring patience and will to be relentless in breaking the visitors down.</p>
      <p>Right-back Jeremie Frimpong has quickly established himself as a fans' favourite and it’s never hard to see. He really is a pocket dynamo.</p>
      <p>Time after time he attacked the byeline and got balls in the box.</p>
      <p>Six minutes in the ex-Man City youngster produced a cut-back for Ryan Christie and he sliced a left foot shot well wide.</p>
      <p>Sixty seconds later he created a chance for himself following a slick Celtic move which saw Brown and Christie move the ball slickly before the Dutch starlet got the chance to run at and beat the lumbering Jon Guthrie in the box.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, Frimpong had clear sight of Livi No1 Matija Sarkic – but from close range he could only manage a weak left foot shot at the keeper.</p>
      <p>Livi were offering nothing other than stubborn defending.</p>

      <p>Forrest had a right foot volley headed over in the 14th minute and then Callum McGregor unleashed a left foot volley straight at Sarkic.</p>
      <p>You felt a goal was coming.</p>
      <p>And it did for Celtic in the 19th minute.</p>
      <p>Tom Rogic’s through ball had Livi believing Edouard was offside.</p>
      <p>But there was no flag and the Frenchman ran on and showed great composure before clipping a superb left foot shot over a sprawling Sarkic from 12-yards.</p>
      <p>Celtic were immediately desperate to put the game to bed with a second goal.</p>
      <p>Rogic produced a deflected left foot shot which Sarkic saved easily.</p>
      <p>McGregor fired well over in the 32nd minute.</p>
      <p>Livi had virtually been camped in their own half – but they broke up the pitch in the 33rd minute and Steven Lawson had a right foot volley well wide.</p>
      <p>Almost immediately Celtic responded and Edouard was presented with another chance.</p>
      <p>Rickie Lamie missed an attempted clearance and the ball fell for the Hoops talisman at the edge of the box. But his side-footed right foot shot was comfortably saved.</p>

      <p>Seven minutes from the break Edouard was put in on goal by a brilliant reverse pass by Forrest and he found himself in an identical position to his goal.</p>
      <p>But this time Sarkic read his intentions and produced a fine save to block his shot.</p>
      <p>Three minutes later great play by Frimpong saw him get to the byeline and clip a perfect pass back for Rogic at point-blank range.</p>
      <p>But just as the Celts fans were preparing to celebrate the Aussie instead shot well over with his left foot. It was a chance.</p>
      <p>Hoops left-back Jonny Hayes had hurt his left shoulder in the first half and it was obviously affecting him early second half.</p>
      <p>After consulting boss Neil Lennon he was replaced by Scotland star Greg Taylor.</p>
      <p>It’s a big credit for Taylor that despite limited club action he’s still come in for his country and delivered.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Now here he had a major chance to press home his claim for a Celtic slot with only a second appearance since a £2 million summer move from Kilmarnock.</p>
      <p>And Taylor impressed.</p>
      <p>Within six minutes of coming on he rattled Sarkic’s near post with a deflected left foot shot from a fine Forrest pass into the box.</p>
      <p>But Celtic got their deserved second goal in the 57th minute.</p>
      <p>Forrest and McGregor combined before Brown – taking the latter’s square pass – hit a right foot shot from 22-yards which ricocheted off Jon Guthrie, sending Sarkic the wrong way, and nestled in the net.</p>
      <p>It was a big goal – finally putting Livi away.</p>
      <p>And the Hoops made it 3-0 in the 64th minute.</p>
      <p>The outstanding Frimpong raced in on goal and forced Sarkic to push up his right foot shot.</p>
      <p>The ball came down from the skies and Forrest, with an accomplished first time right foot volley, caught it cleanly for a stunning eight yard finish.</p>
      <p>Celtic merited the score-line and were relentless in their pursuit of a fourth, carving out numerous chances.</p>
      <p>With just over 20 minutes left the home fans were in raptures again – this time to welcome Griffiths back to the first team.</p>
      <p>His sub appearance got a standing ovation and a firm pat on the back of encouragement from boss Lennon.</p>
      <p>Frimpong produced more great footwork to create a shooting chance, his left foot effort smothered by Sarkic.</p>
      <p>Then Griffiths – from 20-yards – had a left foot shot deflected narrowly over.</p>
      <p>Forrest grabbed Celtic’s fourth in added time with a clinical right foot shot after being put in by Christie.</p>
