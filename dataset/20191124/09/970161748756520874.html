      <p>The subject on everyone’s lips – well, David’s anyway – is Leonard’s proposal to Jill.</p>
      <p>She seemingly dropped a few hints at the end of last week – saying that she had yearned to become her late husband’s wife when they were <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a>, so that he became <i>her</i> husband, not his former wife’s.</p>
      <p>Keen bean Leonard takes this as ironclad evidence Jill wants him to propose to her.</p>
      <p>‘I was happy with things the way they were,’ he tells an incredibly awkward David, as he asks for his blessing with his trousers round his ankles and cow pat up his legs. ‘But I’m quite sure Jill wants to get married.’</p>
      <p>Of course, there is one way to find out without actually having to ask her cold – subtly ask Jill if she’d like to marry again some day. But that wouldn’t be as dramatic, would it – so it’s Leonard to the slaughter.</p>

      <p>Has he got the wrong end of the stick? Yes – it turns out he has.</p>
      <p>David spends the week getting his knickers in a twist about his mum remarrying – after all, he has been gibbering if Leonard does up his mum’s buttons or cooks her a casserole – let alone proposes marriage.</p>
      <p>As one fan wrote on the Archers Appreciation Facebook group, why can’t David just say, ‘”That’s fine Leonard, I’m very happy for you”, and stop being the oldest snowflake in town?</p>
      <p>David finally tells Elizabeth it’s because he doesn’t want Leonard to replace their dad.</p>
      <p>When he finally works through his issues and gives Leonard his blessing, he galumphs into Jill and blows the surprise.</p>
      <p>Jill isn’t as horrified as we suspected she might be – but she did confirm Leonard had misinterpreted her reminiscing.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, looks like it’s time to buy a hat!</p>
      <p>Over to the Grundys and Alf tries to slip off without saying goodbye – but Eddie intercepts him and invites him to stay for Christmas. They’re family, after all, he says.</p>
      <p>Alf is not for turning and heads off – a lone wolf, Eddie tells Ed and Will when they ask where he’s gone. Did you check the valuables, Ed asks  – but Eddie’s not amused. Alf is a lone wolf, and that’s how it will always be.</p>
      <p>Lily is in a huge stew after she told Johnny she saw Bella snogging another man in The Bull – only for Johnny to turn on her and call her a homewrecker.</p>

      <p>Russ manages to squeeze it out of her and is outraged on her behalf.</p>
      <p>As for Johnny, he’s putting brave face on it. He doesn’t want to jeopardise his relationship with Bella and if that means burying his head in the sand, so be it.</p>
      <p>Talking of relationships, Tracey might be about to get into one. She and Emma go to the Grey Gables theatre meal she’d brought in for Oliver – and one of the actors makes eyes at her during the performance.</p>
      <p>Harrison plays wingman and escorts Tracey over to speak to the man – called Roman – but turns out to be the worst at the role, lingering around when they’re trying to flirt and not getting the hint.</p>
      <p>Eventually, Emma comes along and practically drags the third wheel off home, leaving Tracey to get on the pull, as she’d put it.</p>
      <p>Finally, in news that surprises everyone, Justin is enthusiastic about the rewilding!</p>
      <p>Phoebe and the gang are pitching to the board on Tuesday. Finally some enthusiasm. Let the howling wolves come to Ambridge…</p>
