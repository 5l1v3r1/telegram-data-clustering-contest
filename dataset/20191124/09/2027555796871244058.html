      <p>Australia Pakistan's Babar Azam scored his second Test century as his side continued to fight hard to save the first Test against Australia at the Gabba in Brisbane on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Azam brought up his century off 160 balls when he drove Pat Cummins through cover for four runs, his 13th boundary of his innings.</p>
      <p>His only scare came when he was on 75 when he survived a close lbw shout off the bowling of Josh Hazlewood.</p>
      <p>The Australians reviewed the decision but ball tracking showed umpire Richard Kettleborough had made the right decision.</p>
      <p>The visitors still need 127 to make Australia bat again.</p>
      <p>They earlier lost Shan Masood for 42 and Iftikhar Ahmed for a duck in the first session.</p>
