      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:32:37+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:32</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson will promise to keep charging thousands of patients, visitors and staff to park outside hospitals.</p>
      <p>The announcement is set to come in today’s Conservative manifesto - which only ends charges for a fraction of patients, staff and visitors.</p>
      <p>Most NHS staff on daytime shifts and the majority of outpatients would still be stung with fees to park outside hospitals.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> ’s manifesto promises to end the charges for patients, visitors and staff.</p>
      <p>It would only apply to “protected groups” including the elderly, disabled, terminally or gravely ill patients and their families plus NHS nurses working night shifts.</p>
      <p>Labour have described the charges as a "tax on the sick". Labour’s Andrew Gwynne said: "This is another empty promise that shows just how out of touch the Tories are - they offer tinkering when the country needs real change.</p>

      <p>"Under this proposal NHS staff on daytime shifts and the majority of outpatients will still have to pay for parking, leaving people out of pocket just for using public services.</p>
      <p>"In Wales, Labour has shown it’s possible to end this tax on sickness. If the Tories are genuinely committed to ending this problem they have to go further and match Labour’s pledge to ban all charges."</p>
      <p>He added: “Young people can’t afford to buy a home, older people are going without the care they need, our NHS is heading into the worst winter crisis on record and millions of children are growing up in poverty.</p>
      <p>“The only people who benefit from this no hope manifesto are big business and the super-rich who don’t want to see the real change this country needs.</p>
      <p>“This election is a once-in-a-generation chance to elect a Labour government that will transform our country, with a manifesto that offers real change, and take on the vested interests holding people back.”</p>
      <p>The pledge will be funded with £78million-a-year for hospitals in England and £216million in capital funding for 19 hospitals to build multistorey car parks, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Overall, the Tories said today their manifesto will announce:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>No rise in Income Tax, National Insurance or VAT </b>for five years</li>
        <li><b>£78m a year to fund partial free NHS hospital parking for a select few</b> in 'vulnerable groups' - disabled people, frequent outpatient attendees, gravely ill patients, visitors to relatives who have an extended stay in hospital or their carers, and staff on night shifts</li>
        <li><b>Raise threshold for National Insurance to £9,500 next year, </b>which he says will mean a £100 tax cut for 31 million workers - though experts say it won't help the poorest who already don't pay NI</li>
        <li>
          <b>Keep pensions triple lock, winter fuel payment and the older person’s bus pass</b>
        </li>
        <li><b>£1bn for extra childcare on school premises</b> after lessons and during holidays in a bid to get 250,000 more primary school children onsite childcare over the summer. This is £250m a year for 3 years to boost term-time and holiday provision in schools; and £250m capital for the first year to kick-start the plan by getting staff, equipment or premises</li>
        <li>
          <b>£6.3bn making social housing more energy efficient</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Keep energy price cap</b>
        </li>
        <li><b>New ban on exporting plastic waste </b>to poorer countries outside OECD</li>
        <li>
          <b>£2bn over four years for a national programme to fill potholes</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>But he will not give automatic free TV licences to over-75s - saying that will remain the BBC’s responsibility despite the Tories breaking a previous pledge to protect the benefit.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-boris-johnson-breaks-pledge-20939263">Boris Johnson has rejected calls to help women hit by state pension age rises,</a> despite <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/labour-party-promises-30000-payouts-20947106">Labour pledging a £58bn package today.</a></p>
