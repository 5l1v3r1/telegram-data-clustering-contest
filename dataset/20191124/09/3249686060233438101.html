      <p><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/top">T.O.P</a> recently shared good news regarding a recent art auction involving his great-grandfather <b>Kim Hwan Ki</b>'s work.</p>
      <p>On November 24 KST, the idol took to his personal Instagram account to write:<i> "I'm so proud of my great-grandfather, whose masterpiece has set another world record tonight. A true artist who bridged between modernism and contemporary art! His new world record that he broke again! #anotherworldrecord #15.5bil #13mil #mygreatgrandfather #koreanlegend #kimhwanki."</i><br/><br/>The post included a short video from <b>Christie's</b> auction house's Asian social media account, which went over not only a bit about Kim Hwan Ki's art personality, but also introduced his painting '<b>Universe</b>,' which sold during a Christie's auction in Hong Kong for over $13.2 million USD.<br/><br/>'Universe' is a 254 cm x 254 cm (roughly 8 foot x 8 foot) two-panel painting, easily the artist's largest work. It is comprised of a series of blue dots ranging in hue, with no two dots being exactly the same. The painting is the first by a Korean painter to be sold for over 10 billion won (roughly $8.5 million USD).<br/><br/>In response to this exciting news, T.O.P's Instagram followers left comments such as: <i>"Wow, a true masterpiece! It's beautiful!," "Wow, art really runs in your blood," "Congratulations!,"</i> and <i>"'Universe' is pretty. Kim Hwan Ki painter created really beautiful pieces."</i></p>
