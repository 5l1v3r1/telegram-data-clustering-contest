      <h1>Chorley turn the tables on Torquay United</h1>

        <b>Chorley 1 Torquay United 0</b>
      </p>
      <p>A very committed performance brought Chorley back-to-back National League wins for the first time and now the Magpies remain bottom of the table only on goal-difference with three teams on 19 points.</p>
      <p>A missed penalty cost Jamie Vermiglio’s men an easier second-half ride but they stood tall and soaked up Torquay’s pressure, though the visitors in truth did not possess that extra edge which might have produced an equaliser.</p>
      <p>The sharpness of the league’s leading scorer Jamie Reid – out injured – was clearly much missed.</p>
      <p>Experienced manager Gary Johnson pulled no punches in assessing his side’s poor performance.</p>
      <p>He said: “You wouldn’t have realised who was bottom of the league and who was nearer the top. Chorley had more about them and they beat us in every area.</p>
      <p>“From the first minute they were better than us. I feel for our travelling fans because we did absolutely nothing out there today.”</p>
      <p>There was plenty of pace and energy in the game from the start but it took time to produce anything of real danger.</p>
      <p>However, the Magpies struck in the 24th minute to create a lovely goal. Mark Ross played a one-two with Matt Challoner and slung over an inviting cross from which Marcus Carver beat Shaun MacDonald with a measured looping header from 10 yards.</p>
      <p>Nortei Nortey was close to adding a second, firing only just wide from 25 yards.</p>
      <p>As the interval approached Matt Urwin was twice called upon to make regulation saves but he excelled shortly after the break with a great stop from Ben Whitfield, Adam Blakeman hacking the loose ball clear.</p>
      <p>Chorley were given the chance to extend their lead from a penalty on 52 minutes when Charles Vernam was felled in the box.</p>
      <p>But McDonald guessed correctly and pulled off a superb diving save from Vernam’s spot-kick.</p>
      <p>The Magpies lacked nothing in resolve and defended with impressive tenacity in the face of mounting Torquay pressure, while at the same time threatening on the break.</p>
      <p>Vernam curled one fine effort just past the post and Nortey struck a low drive towards the bottom corner of the net, MacDonald again distinguishing himself in turning the ball behind.</p>
      <p>Torquay did fashion a couple of late chances but Manny Duku could not convert either of them.</p>
      <p>Off-balance at close range, he directly the ball tamely at Urwin and then forced the keeper to dive and smother his header.</p>
      <p>But in the end the points stayed at Victory Park, a gritty win loudly acclaimed by the home fans in a decent crowd of 1,281.</p>
      <p>“I’m delighted for everyone at the club but especially for the players, who have had a really tough time of it in this league,” said boss Vermiglio.</p>
      <p>“We haven’t just dragged ourselves over the line today, we’ve played some good football and could have scored two or three.</p>
      <p>“And when we had to defend, we defended very well. It’s still going to be tough but we’ve given ourselves a chance now to climb the table.”</p>
      <p>CHORLEY: Urwin, Baines, Nortey, Meppen-Walter, Challoner, Ross, Blakeman, A Newby (O’Keefe 76), Carver (Massanka 80), Vernam (Cottrell 90+2). Subs not used: E Newby, Holroyd.</p>
