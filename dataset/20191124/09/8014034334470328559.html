      <p>WINDHOEK, Namibia — Namibia votes Wednesday in an election that promises to be far removed from the overwhelming victories enjoyed by former liberation movement SWAPO since independence in 1990.</p>
      <p>President Hage Geingob faces an unexpected challenge from a dentist who is running as an independent but retains his membership in the ruling party.</p>
      <p>Observers say challenger Dr. Panduleni Itula could grab a sizeable share of the youth vote in the southern African country where inequality and unemployment are high.</p>
      <p>The ruling SWAPO has been shaken by the weakening economy, which has shed thousands of jobs. Some 46% of youth are unemployed. Meanwhile more than 700,000 people have registered for drought relief as hunger grows.</p>
