      <p>It's not secret that the reason behind Jin's good pronunciation is the result of his hardwork as he learned <a href="https://twitter.com/tinyseokjinnie/status/1014373167240900608?s=19">acting vocalization</a> when he studying to become an actor back then before he become a trainee at bighit.
