      <p>A driver has been charged after £10m worth of cocaine was found hidden in a load of frozen fish.</p>
      <p>The haul was discovered in the back of a refrigerated van when the vehicle was searched as it came off a ferry at Newhaven port, in East Sussex, in the early hours of Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Officers found 97 packages, each containing around 1kg of cocaine.</p>
      <p>The National Crime Agency said the drugs could have been sold for about £10m at street value.</p>
      <p>James Satterley, 50, from Cookham, Maidenhead, has been charged with importing class A drugs. He was remanded in custody and is due to appear before Brighton magistrates on Monday.</p>
      <p>Paul Morris, the NCA senior investigating officer, said: “NCA officers are working alongside Border Force, Sussex police, Thames Valley police and the south-east regional organised crime unit to investigate this seizure and the circumstances around it.</p>
      <p>“Working with partners, we are determined to do all we can to disrupt the organised crime groups involved in the large-scale importation of class A drugs, which fuel serious violence and impact some of the most vulnerable members of our society.</p>
      <p>“Making seizures like this is an important part of that work.”</p>
