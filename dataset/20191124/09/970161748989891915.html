      <p>Gavin And Stacey co-creator Ruth Jones switched on the Barry Christmas lights in Wales in the character of Nessa and obviously, it was everything.</p>
      <p>Wearing her iconic black cropped hair and dressed in typical Nessa gear, the 53-year-old actress filled her speech with classic lines from the BBC comedy much to the delight of the excited audience.</p>
      <p>Taking to the stage, the star asked the packed crowd ‘what’s occurin’?’ before adding that it was ‘crackin’ to see everyone gathered around for the special occasion.</p>

      <p>‘There are some lookers out here tonight,’ Nessa continued. ‘A few exes in the crowd there I can see.’</p>
      <p>Honestly, this has got us buzzing tenfold for the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/05/the-first-reviews-for-the-gavin-and-stacey-christmas-special-are-in-and-its-lush-11043406/">hotly-anticipated Gavin And Stacey Christmas special</a> that’s due to land on our television screens on 25 December.</p>

      <p>‘Over the last 10 years we’ve talked a lot about Gavin And Stacey – where they might be today and what their lives might look like,’ they said in a joint statement.</p>

      <p>‘And so in secret we took the plunge and wrote this one-hour special.</p>
      <p>‘We’ve loved revisiting Barry and Essex again and bringing the characters back together has been a joy.’</p>
      <p>Earlier this month <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/gavin-stacey-cast-arrive-press-launch-countdown-christmas-special-officially-begins-11038639/">the cast of Gavin And Stacey were all smiles</a> as they arrived for the press screening for the hotly-anticipated Christmas special in London.</p>
      <p>Actress Alison Steadman, who plays meme queen Pam Shipman, said that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/gavin-and-staceys-alison-steadman-reveals-christmas-special-was-like-family-reunion-11205246/">returning for the one-off episode was like a ‘family reunion’</a>.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘[Filming] was brilliant,’ she recalled. ‘It was so good to be back on Barry Island! I really was quite nervous about it because expectations are so high.</p>
      <p>She continued to <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/gavin-stacey-star-alison-steadman-20938379">OK!</a>: ‘I thought, “Can I do it again? Can I get the character back properly?” But as soon as we were all back together it was just like a family reunion. At the end we were all really sad to say goodbye.’</p>
      <p>Not long to go now, folks!</p>
