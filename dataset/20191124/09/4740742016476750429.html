      <p>Home to England’s first female doctor and the iconic suspension bridge, our city is one which is steeped in history.</p>
      <p>But this past year has been phenomenal for Bristol, with many interesting and exciting things taking place in just the past 12 months alone.</p>
      <p>So we have reflected back and summed up some of the amazing things which have happened in Bristol since the German market last rolled into town. </p>

      <p>Celebrating Bristol and all of its character, we received more than 1,000 nominations from you, and short listed 56 businesses.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Thekla is one of the cities paramount venues for music and entertainment and has welcomed a huge number of the world’s very best bands and acted as a platform for up-and-coming acts to showcase their talents.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year it was highlighted just how popular Thekla is amongst Bristolians as a survey carried out in January revealed that the existing hull was nearing the end of its life, sparking fears amongst musicians and regular visitors.</p>
      <p>But, following a three-month closure, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/bristol-music-venue-thekla-return-3274965">the iconic ship saw a £1m restoration and reopened on September 9</a>.</p>

      <p>This was an outstanding achievement as although the city missed out on the main prize of one million Euros, Bristol was one of five runners up to receive cash.</p>

      <p>Bristol’s food scene serves up plenty of reasons for us to feel proud and this month it earned an impressive award.</p>

      <p>Bristol residents demonstrated community strength as almost 100,000 signed a petition in support of the teenager who was told he would be deported when he turned 18.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/stiven-bregu-bristol-petition-deportation-3151057">Stiven Bregu saw victory in July as he won his appeal.</a>
      </p>
      <p>And the great news didn’t stop there. In August, Stiven learned he had been successful in the exams he sat at St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School, Bristol.</p>
      <h3>Team of women caught runaway dog after stray lived at Blaise Castle for four months</h3>

      <p>Another memorable and amazing achievement of 2019 concerns a team of women, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/incredible-story-zena-terrified-runaway-3380782">who came together to catch a runaway stray that had been missing for six months</a>.</p>
      <p>The terrified dog, who swam the River Avon at Shirehampton at least five times and lived as a stray at Blaise Castle for four months was finally caught in October 2019.</p>
      <p>Shelly Spiller, Amanda James, Hazel Richards, Denise Preston and Linda Edwards refused to give up on Zena, who was petrified of humans after a traumatic ordeal.</p>
      <p>We were touched by this remarkable experience and are pleased to say that Zena is in the care of Claws and Paws, recovering from her ordeal, and ready to restart her new life in Bristol again.</p>
      <h3>The first black-owned TV production company launched</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Bristol is well known for award-winning TV entertainment, particularly in drama, wildlife documentaries, and animation. However, diversity and a lack of representation continues to be an issue in this sector.</p>
      <p>According to the latest Creative Skillset employment census, BAME representation in the industry declined across production, distribution and exhibition from 2009-12, and BAME employment in the film-production sector fell from 10 per cent to three per cent.</p>
      <p>But, in October we revealed <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/first-black-owned-tv-production-3463708">Bristol had welcomed its first black TV production company to the city - Blak Wave</a>.</p>
      <h3>The Wave opened</h3>

        <figcaption>Sessions in the intermediate area have been cancelled<cite>(Image: James Beck/Freelance)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>After nearly a decade of planning, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/the-wave-location-easter-compton-3465566">Bristol opened its doors to The Wave in October.</a></p>
      <p>Nine years after ambitious plans were unveiled by surfer Nick Houndsfiled, members of the public and professional surfers are now able to ride the waves at the new inland surfing lake.</p>
      <p>The £25million venture, based in Easter Compton, is the first full-size facility, open to the public in Europe, that is powered by Wavegarden’s Cove wave-making technology and provides up to 1,000 waves of varying sizes and shapes an hour.</p>
      <p>And it is right here in Bristol. Aren’t we lucky?</p>
      <h3>Bristol Pride</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-pride">Bristol Pride</a> outdoes itself every year, but 2019 was even bigger as thousands took part in the festivities to celebrate Bristol Pride’s 10th anniversary that took place on Saturday, July 13.</p>
      <p>From circus nights, to dog shows, to gaming events - the lead up to the South West’s biggest pride parade and festival was booming.</p>
      <p>This year the festival moved from its usual home of Millennium Square, to a new location at The Downs, and it was amazing to see thousands celebrating the LGBT+ community.</p>
      <h3>First slave trade lecturer</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>October was a month of magnificent happenings and the employment of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/university-bristol-slavery-history-professor-3474699">Bristol’s first professor of the History of Slavery</a> is amongst those.</p>
      <p>Prof Olivette Otele will take up her new role, at the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/university-of-bristol">University of Bristol</a>, in the New Year, and one of her first jobs will be to undertake wide-ranging research into the city’s involvement in the transatlantic slave trade.</p>
      <p>The new role provides Bristol with an opportunity to interrogate our history, working with staff, students and local communities to explore the University’s historical links to slavery, Prof Squires told Bristol Live.</p>
      <p>We are proud of Bristol and everything the city has accomplished this year. What else should be on this list?</p>
