      <p>Simon Francis was also sent off before the half-time break, and a 57th-minute header from Steve Cook was not enough to salvage anything for the 10-man Cherries.</p>

      <p>That form, the performance against Bournemouth and the individual display of Moutinho have all come in for praise from the national media.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Here's how they reported <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves'</a> latest victory...</i>
      </p>
      <h4>THE TELEGRAPH</h4>
      <p>On the day Jose Mourinho returned to the Premier League, Wolves fans were left singing ‘Nuno’s the Special One’ as their own Portuguese manager masterminded an impressive victory of his own.</p>
      <p>It lifts Wolves into fifth place as Raul Jimenez scored his fourteenth goal of the season, a tally that leaves him level with Raheem Sterling.</p>
      <p>Santo’s classy side had eased into a two goal lead in half an hour as Bournemouth struggled to match their movement and tenacity in the early stages.</p>
      <p>It was a nightmare 45 minutes for Howe’s men as captain Simon Francis was sent off ten minutes before half time for two bookings. He was starting his first game in the Premier League since December following a cruciate knee ligament injury.</p>
      <p>Francis picked up his first booking as he scythed down Diogo Jota just outside the penalty area as Wolves raced down the left.</p>
      <p>Joao Moutinho punished the mistake but curling a brilliant free-kick into the top right-hand corner leavning Aaron Ramsdale stranded in the Bournemouth goal.</p>
      <p>Ten minutes later they had a second, this time exploiting space on the other flank.</p>
      <p>Moutinho was once again integral, initiating a quick free-kick to release Adam Traore who centred for Raul Jimenez to score from close range.</p>

      <p>Wolves climbed to fifth after first-half goals from João Moutinho and Raúl Jiménez brushed aside a slovenly Bournemouth, who had the returning club captain, Simon Francis, sent off before the interval.</p>
      <p>Nuno Espírito Santo’s side turned in a peerless display, with Moutinho’s sublime free-kick setting Wolves en route to victory before Jiménez, one of the division’s best predators, doubled their advantage with his 14th goal of the season, prompting fans to unfurl a Mexico flag in the away end.</p>
      <p>Steve Cook pulled a goal back but Wolves extended their unbeaten streak to eight league matches.</p>
      <p>Eddie Howe’s side appear on a slippery slope, having won only one of their past eight matches. I</p>
      <p>t does not get any easier either, with a trip to Tottenham Hotspur next – José Mourinho’s first home game in charge – and dates with Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea to follow in December.</p>
      <p>This was a pedestrian performance from a Bournemouth perspective, tepid from the start and, in truth, they were fortunate to trail by only two goals at the interval, with Cook denying Jiménez a second off the line.</p>

      <p>“The first half must be our reference for the way we want to proceed,” Espírito Santo said.</p>
      <p>Francis’s first league start since Boxing Day proved chastening, with the 34-year-old, who returned to captain Bournemouth on the right of a back three, guilty of chopping down Diogo Jota on the edge of the box, giving Wolves a free-kick from an acute angle.</p>
      <p>It proved an enticing challenge for Moutinho, who last night signed a new contract with the club until 2022.</p>
      <p>He fired a curling shot high into the far corner of Aaron Ramsdale’s goal: a spectacular finish to match an impressive start.</p>

      <h4>DAILY MAIL</h4>
      <p>Joao Moutinho gave Wolves further reason to offer the Portuguese a new deal after pulling the strings in a needlessly nervy win at Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>Moutinho hit the first, a quite brilliant free-kick, and was instrumental in Raul Jimenez's second from a clinical dead ball move.</p>
      <p>Wolves looked home and hosed with two-thirds of the game to go. They were then handed a numerical advantage on 37 minutes after Bournemouth skipper Simon Francis was sent off for two fouls on Diogo Jota.</p>
      <p>It was so one-sided that this appeared as clinical an away performance as you are likely to see, any mention of Leicester City aside.</p>
      <p>But Eddie Howe made half-time changes, Jefferson Lerma coming on for Philip Billing and Arnaut Danjuma for Harry Wilson. Bournemouth were transformed. The crowd too.</p>
      <p>The Vitality Stadium woke up from its slumber and lived up to its name. They hit back through Steve Cook, whose header from Ryan Fraser's corner took a deflection off Adama Traore.</p>

      <p>After a slow start to the campaign, Wolves are beginning to demonstrate the type of form that last season earned them a place in Europe for the first time in 39 years.</p>
      <p>The visitors could hardly have wished for a more comfortable first half and should perhaps have led by a greater margin at the interval.</p>
      <p>Traore was a constant thorn in the Cherries' side down the right flank, but it was Moutinho's ability from set-pieces that gave his side a comfortable two-goal cushion before the break.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese midfielder's dipping free-kick from the edge of the penalty area flew over Aaron Ramsdale and into the top corner to break the deadlock.</p>
      <p>Moutinho's quick thinking from another free-kick then released Traore, whose cross was turned in by Jimenez for the Mexican's 14th goal of the season in all competitions.</p>
      <p>The visitors continued to threaten on the counter-attack in the second half, with Jota twice going close to a third for Wolves.</p>
      <p>The striker had a smart finish disallowed for offside before seeing another powerful effort tipped around the post by Ramsdale.</p>
      <p>Cook's header, which took a slight deflection off Traore, set up a nervous finish on the south coast, but Wolves defended resolutely to close out the win.</p>
