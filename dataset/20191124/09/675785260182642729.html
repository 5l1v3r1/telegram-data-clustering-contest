      <h2>A new ‘hyper-immersive’ gaming experience has opened in London, where players become part of classic games, including Pacman and Brick Breaker</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>From virtual reality to high-definition displays, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/video-games">gaming </a>technology has come on leaps and bounds in recent years.</p>
      <p>Now, a new ‘hyper-immersive’ gaming experience has opened in London, where players become part of classic games, including <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/pacman">Pacman </a>and Brick Breaker.</p>
      <p>The experience, called Electronic Theatre’s LightBox, sees players don <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wearable-technology">visors</a>, each with a unique antenna on it, before entering a small square room.</p>
      <p>While the room seems pretty bare, cleverly-placed projectors quickly transform the walls into motion-sensing touch screens.</p>
      <p>Teams of up to six are then put through a series of interactive games and challenges, ranging from memory tests to agility training.</p>

      <p>The unique antennas on the visors allow the room to track the position of each player, meaning games can be controlled by physically moving around the space.</p>
      <p>For example, during a Brick Breaker game, each player becomes a paddle, and must run up and down the room to bounce the ball up towards the bricks.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, during Pacman, players take it turns to run around the room to collect coins, while avoiding the ghost.</p>

      <p>Will Dean, founder and CEO of Electronic Theatre, said: “Electronic Theatre is an experience that any group - be they friends, family, or work-mates can complete and feel a bit closer to each other.</p>
      <p>“Creating shared memories bonds groups like nothing else. By completing one of our Adventures, teams will create a memory they can look back on together”.</p>
      <p>The first site is located on London’s Southbank, and is open to the public now.</p>
