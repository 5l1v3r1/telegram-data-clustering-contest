        <b>Everything is going Liverpool’s way at the moment, with a late goal from Roberto Firmino this weekend maintaining the Reds’ unbeaten start to the season and their big lead at the top of the Premier League table.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Liverpool narrowly missed out to Manchester City for the title last term, but are now nine points ahead of the reigning champions after a superb start to the 2019/20 campaign.</p>

      <p>While LFC have been brilliant, they’ve also no doubt benefited from some moments of luck, most notably with a number of late goals and some questionable decisions from VAR during their recent win against City at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Pep Guardiola has also had to contend with a number of major injury problems, with the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/pep-guardiola-fears-worst-sergio-20946963">Daily Mirror</a> now reporting on yet another blow.</p>
      <p>Guardiola is quoted by the Mirror as suggesting Sergio Aguero has picked up a bad muscular problem, which will no doubt make it even harder for MCFC to catch up with their rivals.</p>

      <p>“Sergio will be bad, I think. Tomorrow we will know it. The feeling is it’s muscular,” the manager said.</p>
      <p>City have Gabriel Jesus as a very capable alternative up front, but few players in world football can truly replace what Aguero brings this side.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have, meanwhile, coped well with injuries of their own, with Alisson missing a large chunk of the start of the season, while Mohamed Salah also sat out the win over Crystal Palace on Saturday.</p>
