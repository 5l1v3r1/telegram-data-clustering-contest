      <p>Rudy Giuliani said in a tweet Saturday that he has a safe stuffed with “files” on the Bidens.</p>
      <p>“The statement I’ve made several times of having an insurance policy, if thrown under the bus, is sarcastic &amp; relates to the files in my safe about the Biden Family’s 4 decades monetizing of his office,” President Trump’s personal lawyer tweeted Saturday.</p>

      <p>The odd tweet followed by three hours an earlier Saturday tweet by the former federal prosecutor insisting, “The Mafia couldn’t kill me so NO, I am not worried about the swamp press!</p>

      <p>The posts followed an interview with Fox News, during which the former NYC mayor also got defensive when asked if he was concerned that Trump could throw him “under the bus” as the impeachment process heats up.</p>
      <p>Giuliani also ridiculed Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden for claiming he never knew that his son Hunter was on the board of a controversial Ukrainian gas company during his vice-presidency.</p>
      <p>“He says, ‘I don’t know my own family’s business’ — some of it <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/23/rudy-giuliani-joe-biden-is-like-kay-corleone-in-impeachment-drama/">sounds like Kay Corleone,” he said</a>, referring to the pivotal scene in which a mob wife willfully blinds herself to her Mafia-boss husband’s crimes.</p>
