        <b>Machakos Governor <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/politician/alfred-mutua">Alfred Mutua</a> was on Saturday, November 23, elevated to a new leadership role.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Maendeleo Chap Chap Party leader was speaking at Mutonguni Thanksgiving celebration held in Tulia Market, Kitui. During the celebrations, he was installed as a Kamba Elder by <i>Thome wa Akamba</i>, Council of Elders.</p>
      <p>The ceremony was held to the people of Mutonguni ward for voting in the Maendeleo Chap Chap (MCC) member Hon Eng. <b>Muse Mati </b>as the next Member of County assembly for Mutonguni ward.</p>
      <p>“Truly humbled by the honour bestowed unto me by the <i>Thome wa Akamba</i>, Council of Elders today as they installed me as a Kamba Elder. They also tasked me with the responsibility of leading the Kamba nation, a role I humbly accept,” Mutua’s post read.</p>

      <p>Mati won the seat after garnering 2,892 votes against Wiper Party candidate <b>Stephen Kihuka</b>’s 2,147 in the by-election held on October 17, 2019. The victory was seen as a blow to <b>Kalonzo Musyoka</b> who has for a long time been regarded as the defacto Kamba leader.</p>
      <p>“I congratulate the Hon. Eng.<b> Muse Mati</b> on his election to represent the great people of Mutonguni Ward and thank all leaders who came to celebrate with us from all corners of our Country,” Mutua thanked the crowd.</p>
      <p>The event was also graced by other leaders from all over the country such as ODM Member of Parliament Simba Arati. He reassured the voters from Mutogoni ward that Raila Odinga is fully behind them.</p>
      <p>“Raila Odinga has told me that <b>Alfred Mutua</b> is a friend, his invitation must be honoured. Thank you for voting in the engineer” Mr Arati told the crowd.</p>
      <p>Governor <b>Alfred Mutua</b> also took the opportunity to call for peace as the Kenyans wait for the anticipated results of the BBI report on Tuesday, November.</p>
      <p>“As we await the BBI report, I call on all of us to remain objective. Let us all embrace the clarion call of unity, cohesion and peace. The sanctity of Kenya is our ultimate responsibility and I want to affirm my commitment to this noble cause,” Mutua stated.</p>
