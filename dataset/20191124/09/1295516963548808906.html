      <h1>Suicide Squad's David Ayer Releases New Photo of Joker and Harley Quinn</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:11:42+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:11</time> by <a rel="author">Math Erao</a></address>
      <p>David Ayer posted a never-before-seen photo of the Joker and Harley Quinn from his film <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/suicide-squad/">Suicide Squad</a>.</p>
      <p>While there's a new <i>Suicide Squad</i> film on the horizon, Ayer wanted to throw back to his stab at the franchise. In the photo, posted to his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5N3Ocngbn9/">Instagram</a>, we see Margot Robbie and Jared Leto during a makeup and wardrobe test for the film. Check it out:</p>

      <p>Ayer won't be back for the new movie, as <a href="https://www.cbr.com/the-suicide-squad-james-gunn-margot-robbie/">James Gunn will work with Robbie</a> for <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/suicide-squad-2/">The Suicide Squad</a>, the follow-up to/reboot of the 2016 film. As for Leto, he won't be involved in the project, as Warner Bros. seems to have firmly moved on from his taken on the Joker. And with Joaquin Phoenix's Clown Prince of Crown breaking records left and right, it's no surprise that DC doesn't want to juggle two versions of the character.</p>

      <p>But while this Joker won't be getting the last laugh, the new film is said to be even funnier than the first, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/suicide-squad-margot-robbie-comedy/">according to Robbie</a> at least. Luckily, fans of her take on Harley Quinn will get their fill. Along with <i>The Suicide Squad</i>, Robbie will reprise the role in next year's <a href="https://screenrant.com/suicide-squad-2-harley-quinn-role-birds-prey-details/amp/">Birds of Prey</a>.</p>
