      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:02:27+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:02</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, Milo Boyd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>These are the first pictures of a mother and daughter who died when their car was crushed by a falling beech tree in the Cotswolds.</p>
      <p>Elaine Reason, 56, and her 16-year-old daughter Grace, from Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, were driving close to their home when the tragic incident happened at about 10pm on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Heartbroken friends have paid tribute to the pair, who were remembered as the "loveliest" and "kindest people you could ever meet".</p>
      <p>Police are investigating the circumstances of the tragedy at Stanway Hill, near Winchcombe, in Gloucestershire, but he landowner, Lord Wemyss, has claimed: "It is likely that the very wet recent <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> was a cause of the accident.”</p>

      <p>A devastated friend wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> : "We are going to miss then both so much. Grace (was) such a massive kind hearted girl that has been taken way too early.</p>
      <p>"The sky has gained its brightest star yet. Rest in peace both Grace and Elaine. Massive hugs to Tim, Philip, Caroline and the rest of the grieving family."</p>

      <p>Another wrote: "Oh god no! I only saw Grace a few days ago; wearing a beaming smile and with impeccable manners as always!</p>
      <p>"A true role model to other young girls. They were both just the loveliest people. This is absolutely heartbreaking news, I can’t believe it."</p>
      <p>One posted: "I’m still in shock. The kindest people you could ever meet and Grace was always the happiest child with the most infectious smile. Utterly tragic."</p>

      <p>And another added: "As a pair of ‘older’ mums Elaine was always a great support. Grace was just the smiliest, loveliest, girl and they will be so sadly missed by everyone who knew them.</p>
      <p>"Our little community is a sadder place this evening and we have lost two of our brightest stars."</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old mum's car - thought to be a Land Rover Freelander - appeared to be flattened across the middle and was covered by a tarpaulin when it was removed on the back of a truck on Friday afternoon.</p>

      <p>The tree that fell on the car was on land within the privately-owned Stanway Estate, <a href="https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/cheltenham-news/mother-56-daughter-16-thought-3569370">Gloucestershire Live reported.</a></p>
      <p>Estate owner Lord Wemyss issued a statement revealing he had only applied to the county council to fell trees along the affected stretch of road on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He said: “I confirm that the land either side of the road where the tree fell is owned by Stanway Estate.</p>
      <p>“I am very saddened at this tragic accident. I extend deepest sympathy to members of the family.</p>
      <p>“Stanway Estate, which owns the fallen beech tree, has since 2007 professionally assessed the condition of the trees on Stanway Hill, and regularly fells suspect trees. The latest assessment was in 2018.</p>
      <p>“The Estate applied only yesterday to the county council for permission to close Stanway Hill to traffic, in order to carry out further tree felling for safety purposes.</p>
      <p>"It is likely that the very wet recent <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> was a cause of the accident.”</p>
