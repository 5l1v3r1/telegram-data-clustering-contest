      <p>PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (WPBF/CNN) - Police in Florida say when a dog’s owner stepped out of his car, the dog accidentally knocked the car into reverse, sending it in circles around the cul-de-sac.</p>
      <p>Anne Sabol walked outside her house Thursday morning to see a car driving in circles around the Port St. Lucie, Fla., neighborhood. There was no driver behind the wheel.</p>
      <p>"First, I thought I saw somebody backing up, but then, they kept going, and I'm like, ‘OK what are they doing?’” Sabol said. "Then, I saw the dog get out of the car. It was a big, black lab or something, and I'm like, ‘OK, this is turning weird.’”</p>
      <p>Police say the owner of a dog named Max made a wrong turn into the cul-de-sac. He stopped the car and got out, leaving Max inside. The dog accidentally shifted the car into reverse, locking his owner out and causing it to drive in circles.</p>
      <p>Sabol says the car hit a mailbox, a few garbage cans and bricks that were in front of one of the homes, as it circled the neighborhood for about an hour.</p>
      <p>Police finally stopped the car by entering a code in the keypad on the driver side door.</p>
      <p>“When the cops got the door open, a black dog jumped out. I was like, ‘They should give that thing a license,’” Sabol said.</p>
      <p>No one was injured during the incident. The driver said he would replace the destroyed mailbox.</p>
