      <h1>Human Tripod Jason Derulo Denies Photoshopping Peen Pic &amp; Well, Love That For Him</h1>

      <p><b>Jason Derulo </b>initially sent the internet into a frenzy over the weekend after posting a straight-up schlong pic to the ‘gram. Like, a hardcode, in-your-face, schlong pic. Schlong city.</p>
      <p>Exhibit A:</p>

      <p>I mean, seriously, that thing could poke a bloody eye out.</p>
      <p>He then sent users into a <i>further</i> frenzy after acknowledging the… err… <i>anaconda</i> in the room.</p>

      <p>Following speculation that the now-viral Instagram pic was a photoshop job, Derulo reiterated that his manhood is in fact au naturel.</p>
      <p>Speaking with <i><a href="https://www.tmz.com/videos/112219-jason-derulo-4680686-0-eltd04lw/">TMZ</a></i>, the “Swalla” muso admitted that he didn’t expect the pic to be as successful as it was. “It was crazy, man. I honestly didn’t feel like that was going to be my most liked picture, when I woke up this morning. I posted the mother-fucker very early.”</p>
      <p>When asked if his eggplant was digitally enhanced, Derulo adamantly refuted any photoshop theory. “Photoshop? <i>Photoshop?</i> Don’t make me [show you], eh… there’s not enough women in this area.”</p>
      <p>“Just know that us Haitians, we look different.” Well then.</p>
      <p>He’s since capitalised on the pic’s virality, posting a “who did it better” image. If you’ve got it, flaunt it, I guess?</p>

      <p>Good for you Jason Derulo, good for you.</p>
      <p>In other, non-reptilian news, Jason released his EP <i>Side 1</i> earlier this month, and was recently in Australia doing promo for <i>Cats</i>, the highly-anticipated film hitting cinemas next month.</p>
