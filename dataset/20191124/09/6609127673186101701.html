        <b>CELTIC star James Forrest reckons Scotland’s players would welcome back Scott Brown with open arms.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> skipper Broony refused to rule out a return to the national set-up if Steve Clarke’s side make it to the Euro 2020 finals next summer.</p>

      <p>He has retired twice before but has left the door open to a shock comeback if we make it through March’s play-offs.</p>
      <p>Hoops boss Neil Lennon has dampened down those expectations.</p>
      <p>But Forrest, who has 34 caps, thinks the entire Scotland squad would be over the moon to see veteran Brown, 34, step back in.</p>
      <p>He said: “We all know how much Scott does at club level, day in and day out. So if he’s saying that, if he did come back then the staff and players would welcome it.</p>

      <p>“That’s twice he has retired, but he kind of cast a wee bit of doubt on whether he actually retired the second time!</p>
      <p>“But if he came back this time it would be great. It’ll be up to him and the manager to see how everyone is feeling about it, though.”</p>
      <p>Friday’s draw saw Scotland handed a play-off tie with Israel at Hampden on March 26.</p>
      <p>Win that one-off game and a trip to either Norway or Serbia will stand between us and a return to a finals for the first time since 1998.</p>
      <p>Forrest hit a hat-trick to fire Scotland to a 3-2 win over Israel to seal qualification from the Nations League group and into the play-offs when they last faced each other at Hampden a year ago.</p>
      <p>Asked about his treble, Forrest said: “It was a great night for me and for the team. It was the game that got us into the play-offs.</p>
      <p>“When this game comes around we’ll take confidence from that, as we will from the last couple of wins. I got my first Scotland goals in the game against Albania before that match.</p>
      <p>“We had to beat Israel to go through and I was buzzing to get the hat-trick that did it.</p>
      <p>“One of the goals, the one I flicked up and volleyed in, is one of the best I’ve scored — for Celtic or Scotland.</p>
      <p>“It was always going to be a hard game, no matter who we got. We’re at home and we’ll have the fans behind us, so hopefully we can get the same result.</p>
      <p>“There was a bit of banter with Nir Bitton and Hatem Elhamed as soon as our physio Tim Williamson came out and told us the draw! Nir missed the games before so he’s excited about it.</p>
      <p>“They have struggled a wee bit recently but it’s a one-off game and they’ll be right up for it, so it’s still dangerous for us.</p>
      <p>“That’s quite exciting as well. We’ve not had many games for Scotland against some of the other guys who play with us at club level. So there’s a fair bit of banter flying about.</p>
      <p>“Nir’s giving us a bit and big Kris Ajer is quite outspoken, too. They are all wanting to get there, the same as we do.</p>
      <p>“We know Norway and Serbia are both decent but it would be massive if we got there and won.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had guys here who have gone to play in finals for their countries and they come back and tell you all the stories.”</p>
