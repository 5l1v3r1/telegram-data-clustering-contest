      <p>Anil Ravipudi has been teasing the audiences with tidbits and information about his forthcoming Sankranthi release ‘Sarileru Neekevvaru’. One of those teases happens to be about an extraordinary character.</p>
      <p>In the interview that he gave on his birthday, he said that actor Ajay will be seen playing an extraordinary character that represents Mahesh Babu and that character was something that the Telugu Cinema has witnessed.</p>
      <p>Any guesses who would Ajay reprise in ‘Sarileru Neevvaru’ that would be representing Mahesh Babu in real life? Our guess is, it could be one of senior superstar Krishna’s iconic roles or someone who is really close to Mahesh Babu.</p>
      <p>One more guess. It could be one of the most liked entertaining characters that <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/movienews/mahesh-babu-inspires-naga-chaitanya-samantha-akkineni/">Mahesh Babu</a> played like Pandu in ‘Pokiri’ or any other popular entertaining role that the superstar played. This particular track will play throughout the movie. Sounds interesting!</p>
      <p>By the way, there will be an entire train episode, says Anil Ravipudi, a 30-35 minute long train episode picturised on Mahesh Babu that would be mesmerising for the audiences. The director’s confidence is increasing our curiosity day by day, isn’t it?</p>
