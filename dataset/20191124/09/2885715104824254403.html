      <h1>Vidya Balan and Sujoy Ghosh’s Kahaani prequel in works?</h1>
      <h2>Vidya Balan, who featured in Kahaani installments, is reportedly going to collaborate with Sujoy Ghosh for the prequel of the franchise.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:15:01+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/vidya-balan/">Vidya Balan</a> is collaborating with Sujoy Ghosh for the third time after Kahaani and Kahaani 2. If reports are to be believed, the director is planning a prequel, which will trace the journey of Vidya Venkatesan Bagchi and how she came up with the idea of taking revenge in Kahaani.</p>
      <p>“The new version is being planned as a Kill Bill kind of an idea. Vidya Balan has just completed the shoot of her film Shakuntala Devi: The Human-Computer, and is expected to work on her next film depending on which of the scripts that she is perusing works out the best and the quickest. Sujoy has an idea for the prequel, but he will not be directing this one. His daughter Diya Ghosh, who has assisted him on Badla and also made an English short earlier in 2018 called Neighbourhood Ties, is expected to helm the venture,” a source revealed to The Deccan Chronicle.</p>
      <p>On the work front, Vidya Balan wrapped up Shankuntala Devi biopic in which the actor plays the lead role. Backed by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sony/">Sony</a> Pictures Networks Productions and Vikram Malhotra, the film will see a worldwide release in the summer of 2020.</p>
      <p>Sujoy, on the other hand, had a great year with Badla release and Netflix series Typewriter.</p>
