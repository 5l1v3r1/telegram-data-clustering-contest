      <p>I attended the Everett City Council meeting on Nov. 13. Item 19 on the agenda was in regard to the recommendation from the Planning Commission to the council on the topic of the 2016 Ordinance allowing “supportive housing” on any public owned property, including single-family neighborhoods, throughout the city.</p>
      <p>I was not only surprised at the premature recommendation by a council member to allow 34-70 apartments in a single-family neighborhood without discussion or fact-finding with other city council members or even a clear understanding of what the planning commission was recommending, but additionally saying that single family neighborhoods are “a thing of the past,” and she would like to see more multifamily and supportive housing in all neighborhoods, and no more single-family neighborhoods in Everett.</p>
      <p>Clearly, using all of her own stated personal experience demonstrates her possible inability to be unbiased and represent all of our citizens.</p>
      <p>Do the residents of Everett really want to lose all of our single-family neighborhoods? Are we being represented fairly? If you want to witness this meeting for yourself tune into Everett Channel 21 for televised recording.</p>
