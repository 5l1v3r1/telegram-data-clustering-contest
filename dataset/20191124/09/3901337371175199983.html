      <p>Mourinho began his Spurs tenure with a 3-2 victory over London rivals West Ham United on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The win ended a barren of poor results on the road in the Premier League season, but Mourinho felt the need to apologise for not going to the away stand at the end of the game.</p>
      <p>"At the end of the game I didn’t want to go to our fans because I felt I shouldn’t,’ Mourinho told Spurs TV.</p>
      <p>"It’s about the players, not about me.</p>
      <p>"Apologies for that, I stayed away.</p>
      <p>"But I appreciate the few thousand who were there behind the team and I think really enjoying and understanding the difficulties and supporting, and probably now as happy as we are."<br/><br/><b><a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/english-premier-league/five-players-jose-mourinho-could-sign-in-january/667822">Read: Five Players Mourinho Could Sign In January</a></b></p>
