        <b>CELTIC star Leigh Griffiths scored two goals last week in a bounce game against Stenhousemuir.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not quite up there with the two free-kicks he bent around Joe Hart two years ago, but it’s a start.</p>

      <p>And if it means the striker has beaten the demons that have plagued him, good for him.</p>
      <p>Griff is proof that a fat wage packet doesn’t immunise footballers from mental illness.</p>
      <p>Having battled depression himself, Neil Lennon will know what his player has overcome.</p>
      <p>But let me be brutally honest. Now the striker is fit enough to play, he has to get the finger out.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> couldn’t have done more to support Griffiths. You can bet he’s had the best medical support money can buy.</p>
      <p>When they could have been tempted to rush him back, they’ve given him breathing space. Now he’s pulling his boots on again, he must give Lennon some payback.</p>
      <p>Frankly, for all his talent, he has never been a model pro.</p>
      <p>Ronny Deila flagged that up when claiming Griff’s fitness wasn’t good enough. Deila wanted the striker to become a “24-hour athlete.”</p>
      <p>The Norwegian wouldn’t be the last Celtic boss to question the player’s attitude.</p>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers called Griffiths out when he was spotted at Newcastle races while Celtic were training in Dubai last year.</p>
      <p>At the time Rodgers said he had “ongoing issues” that saw him check into rehab.</p>
      <p>Enraged by Griffiths’ appearance on Tyneside, Rodgers reminded him he wasn’t on holiday saying “The club can only help him if he wants to help himself.”</p>

      <p>Fast forward ten months and Griffiths finds himself at a crossroads. He can either bust his backside getting back to being the player he was, or throw away what’s left of his career.</p>
      <p>In a sport where nobody escapes the brutality of time, the clock is ticking down on the 29-year-old. Lennon has to hope the striker will wise up.</p>
      <p>A fit Griffiths would be priceless for Celtic heading towards the business end of the season. Right now Celts are a hostage of Odsonne Edouard’s fitness.</p>
      <p>An injury to the young Frenchman will leave Lennon seriously short up front.</p>
      <p>It could come down to how much trust Lennon has in Griffiths. If he believes the player is doing all he can to get back up to speed, he’ll stick with him.</p>
      <p>Anything less will see Neil look elsewhere for a striker in the January window.</p>
      <p>Given his track record, I wouldn’t write Griffiths off, he’s spent his career proving people wrong.</p>
      <p>When he was scoring for fun in the First Division for Dundee, not one top-flight Scottish club fancied him.</p>

      <p>Instead, he had to prove himself at Wolves where he was top scorer by the time Celtic bought him in 2014.</p>
      <p>Despite Deila’s doubts about him, Griffiths was also Celts’ top scorer in his first full season.</p>
      <p>When Moussa Dembele was running riot for Rodgers, Griff couldn’t get a sniff. But he later emerged as a key player during that unbeaten season.</p>
      <p>Even at international level, he has found himself up against it. For long enough Gordon Strachan couldn’t see past Steven Fletcher and Chris Martin.</p>
      <p>When it would have been easy for Leigh to walk away, he hung in there. By the time he made a fool of Hart at Hampden he was the first name on Strachan’s team-sheet.</p>
      <p>But all of that is in the past. It’s where Griffiths wants to go now that counts.</p>
      <p>If he looks across the city he’ll see Jermain Defoe still playing at 37. That doesn’t happen by accident, only by slavish dedication to the job.</p>
      <p>Does Griffiths have that in him? He has already written his chapter in Celtic history. Anyone getting to 50 goals in fewer games than Henrik Larsson has achieved something special.</p>
      <p>But he can either make an ignominious exit from the club or prove his doubters wrong again.</p>
      <p>Given what he’s come through, getting up to match fitness should be a breeze for him if he still has the appetite.</p>
      <p>With this season’s title race shaping up to be a nerve shredder, he couldn’t ask for a better incentive.</p>
      <p>A succession of Celtic managers could have given up on Griffiths, but made it their business to help him instead. Now it’s time for Griff to help himself.</p>
      <p>CHARISMATIC SFA president Rod Petrie says Hampden will be “European class” in time to host next summer’s Euro 2020 games.</p>
      <p>What does that mean? Supposedly undercover on the TV gantry last week, broadcasters were getting soaked during the Kazakhstan game.</p>
      <p>God knows what it was like for punters paying top dollar for front row seats. Right now Hampden is a soulless relic.</p>
      <p>If Petrie’s gang want to do Steve Clarke a favour for the Israel game, they’ll move it to Celtic Park or Ibrox.</p>
      <p>WHEN it comes to job security who wouldn’t want to be a director of football?</p>
      <p>You get to recruit the players and when they’re not good enough the guy in the dugout gets sacked.</p>
      <p>Most recently at Hibs, Paul Heckingbottom was emptied while head of recruitment Graeme Mathie was promoted to sporting director.</p>
      <p>Of Jack Ross’s appointment Mathie says: “I want to make sure everybody understands we’re all culpable for performances on the pitch.”</p>
      <p>I’ll remind him of that if Ross ever gets his P45.</p>
      <p>I’M in agreement with Neil Lennon who once said Under-21 football is a waste of time.</p>
      <p>Makes you wonder what he makes of the possibility of losing Odsonne Edouard for Celtic’s European qualifiers next summer.</p>
      <p>Edouard wants to play for France’s Under-23 Olympic team in Tokyo. If France make the final the striker would miss five Champions League or Europa League qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Lenny should remind Edouard that Celtic pay his wages.</p>
      <p>PARTICK THISTLE fans should take Colin Weir’s name off their main stand. They should build a statue of him instead.</p>
      <p>The EuroMillions winner’s purchase of the club prevented the Jags from becoming a feeder club for Barnsley.</p>
      <p>Instead, Thistle will be debt-free, fan-owned and underpinned by their own youth academy. With Ian McCall in charge, the only way is up.</p>
      <p>LIVERPOOL’S Joe Gomez could be excused if he quits England duty.</p>
      <p>The innocent party in the brawl with Raheem Sterling, Gomez found himself booed by England fans when coming on as sub against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>That had head teacher Gareth Southgate saying: “It’s been a tough week but one that will make him stronger and one that he’s dealt with well.”</p>
      <p>Had Southgate been savvy enough to keep the spat in-house instead of grandstanding to the media, Gomez would have been spared humiliation.</p>
