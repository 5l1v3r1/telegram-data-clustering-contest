      <p>DUBAI — Creditors of Abu Dhabi-based Al Jaber Group are considering enforcing claims against the owners of the group after delays in executing a restructuring agreement, the latest in a long-running debt dispute, two sources familiar with the matter said.</p>
      <p>Al Jaber, best known as a contractor but with interests across a range of sectors, has struggled since a construction downturn in the United Arab Emirates after the global financial crisis.</p>
      <p>The group agreed late last year restructuring terms for 5.9 billion dirhams ($1.6 billion) of debt, in a deal that would have seen the company reduce its obligations through asset sales and a debt buyback mechanism with a 52% discount.</p>
      <p>But delays in implementing some aspects of the deal have frustrated a majority of creditors – including hedge funds and Abu Dhabi lenders Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and First Abu Dhabi Bank – who are planning to take action against the group owners, the sources said.</p>
      <p>“Lenders have reached the finish line,” one of them said.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Al Jaber said the company signed earlier this year the terms of an agreement with its lenders, but not all of its creditors approved it.</p>
      <p>“Since then, the group has continued to pursue its core objective of reaching a similarly structured agreement at the earliest opportunity and has been encouraging all lenders to participate in productive dialog towards this end.”</p>
      <p>First Abu Dhabi Bank and Abu Dhabi Commercial banks declined to comment.</p>
      <p>The company began talks with creditors in 2011 after building up debt to expand beyond construction work.</p>
      <p>As part of the latest agreement, it was expected to appoint a new board, sell operating companies, some of its investment portfolio, and shareholder assets such as the Shangri-La hotels in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p>In exchange for this, creditors – who are advised by PwC – agreed to extend the maturity of Al Jaber’s 5.9 billion dirhams loan, cut interest rates, and provide additional revolving debt.</p>
      <p>But while the company has fulfilled some aspects of the agreement, it has so far not sold assets, despite receiving interest from potential buyers, said one of the sources.</p>
      <p>The potential enforcement by creditors would be on a “related party balance” of 4.5 billion dirhams that the company’s chairman owes to the business, and which creditors have security over, the same source said.</p>
      <p>Before its latest restructuring agreement, Al Jaber had reached a debt restructuring deal in June 2014, but it missed debt repayments in the following years.</p>
      <p>Several companies in the UAE have sought to extend their debt maturities or agree better terms over the past few years to avoid defaults, after a collapse in oil prices hit firms’ revenues, particularly in sectors such as construction and energy services.</p>
