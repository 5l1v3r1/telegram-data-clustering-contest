      <p>She may seem all sweetness and light from the exterior but unsettling nanny Jade Rowan (Lottie Henshall) looks set to destroy the lives of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fiz/">Fiz Stape</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jennie-mcalpine/">Jennie McAlpine</a>) and Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) with some inexplicable scheming. But who is she and why does she have a vendetta?</p>
      <p>We have already seen her try and manipulate both Tyrone and his nan Evelyn Plummer (Maureen Lipman) as well as showing that she has some sort of issue with Fiz during her time spent with Hope.</p>
      <p>Fiz is completely oblivious to anything amiss but savvy Corrie fans aren’t – and are seriously worried about what Jade might have in store for the family.</p>

      <p>As Hope’s behaviour starts to threaten to get out of control once more, Tyrone reckons that he and Fiz should give in to her tantrums over her demands for a fireworks party.</p>
      <p>However, they are left regretting it when a fire takes hold in the back yard, with pyromaniac Hope watching the flames with amusement. But when Jack Webster mentions that the fire had already started when he and Hope got to the yard, it seems like there is something else afoot. Could Jade have been involved?</p>

      <p>As Fiz despairs and comes clean to Tyrone about how bad things got with Hope, Jade offers to babysit so they can have a night out together – but what is she plotting this time? Hope and Tyrone have a frank discussion about Hope and make the decision to be more disciplined with her.</p>
      <p>But Jade privately takes Evelyn aside and voices her worries about Fiz’s behaviour management and parenting skills. Is she trying to formulate doubt around Fiz? And is she determined to drive a rift in the family with suspicion?</p>
      <p>Later, Fiz is glad to get Hope started back at Bessie Street primary and she tells Jade that she is no longer needed. But this could just be a red rag to a bull…</p>
