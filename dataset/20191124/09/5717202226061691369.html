      <h1>Leeds United will hope change of circumstances impact Matej Vydra’s wage demands</h1>
      <h2>Leeds United are believed to be keen on a deal for Czech Republic international Matej Vydra.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:15:53+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United are reportedly looking into a deal for Burnley attacker Matej Vydra, according to reports. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/?service=responsive">The Mirror (22/11/2019; pg 74) are reporting </a>that the West Yorkshire side are plotting a £7.5 million bid to bring the Czech Republic international from Turf Moor to Elland Road. </p>
      <p>Leeds were, of course, heavily linked with a move for Vydra in the summer of 2018, before he eventually left Derby County to join Sean Dyche’s men.</p>
      <p>That move has not proved to be a success, with Vydra struggling for regular first-team football at the Lancashire club. </p>
      <p>Considering Vydra’s excellent record in the Championship, it will undoubtedly be a deal that has Leeds fans excited. He could provide the spark needed to help Leeds in their elusive hunt for promotion back to the Premier League.</p>

      <p>However, Leeds will have to overcome the same problems that prevented his potential 2018 switch. </p>
      <p>Former chief Leeds correspondent <a href="https://twitter.com/PhilHay_/status/1019149074761764864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1019149074761764864&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthe72.co.uk%2F110057%2Fleeds-matej-vydra-huge-wage-demands-are-crazy-money%2F">at the Yorkshire Evening Post</a>, Phil Hay, tweeted back in July 2018 that Vydra wanted in excess of £50,000-a-week to make the move to Leeds just 18 months ago. </p>
      <p>Those wage demands eventually saw Leeds back away from a deal and instead make a move for Patrick Bamford. </p>
      <p>The problem back then was that Vydra was not desperate for a move away from Derby and that he also the Rams as equals to Leeds when it came to a promotion battle. </p>
      <p>In the end, he headed to Burnley but is now struggling for first-team football. With one eye on a potential Euro 2020 squad spot, Vydra will want to be playing regularly and that could give Leeds the chance to bring those wages down on this occasion. </p>
