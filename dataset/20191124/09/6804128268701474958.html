      <h1>Spurs fans will love Lucas Moura's tweet to a supporter after Jose Mourinho's first win</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham beat West Ham 3-2 at the London Stadium</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:01:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:01</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho won his first game as Tottenham Hotspur head coach after a 3-2 win against West Ham United.</p>
      <p>Goals from Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane sealed Spurs' first three points away from home since January and lifts the north London side to ninth in the table.</p>
      <p>Moura was handed a start by Mourinho, after being benched by Mauricio Pochettino for the 1-1 draw against Sheffield United before the international break.</p>
      <p>And the former Paris Saint-Germain winger rewarded his new head coach with a goal in the first half to give Tottenham a 2-0 lead.</p>
      <p>After the game, Moura posted a tweet regarding a chance he missed during the game. A fan wrote: 'Can we take a minute to discuss your miss please Lucas?'</p>
      <p>The Brazilian responded with a grinning emoji. Another Spurs supporter replied with: 'That night in Amsterdam more than makes up for the miss!!'</p>
      <p>And the 27-year-old said: 'Hahahahha thank you.'</p>

      <p>Speaking after the game, Mourinho explained the slight tweaks he made for the game.</p>
      <p>"I think sometimes you see 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 and sometimes people think it's the same. It's never the same because with the same positional, tactical base, the most important thing is the dynamic you bring</p>
      <p>" I think I want to do my things. I've started to do my things. I hope that you don't understand it very well and don't speak about it a lot but you know positional play is different and very adaptive to the players.</p>
      <p>"I tried to give the players comfort and especially in this moment where a little bit of emotion around it and trying to give them comfort by asking of them things that they can give. Sometimes we complicate things and ask things of the players that they're not ready to give.</p>
      <p>"I try to ask the boys, Dele, of course <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/harry-kane">Harry</a> , Son, Lucas, Harry Winks, Eric, I tried to give them exactly what the easiest job is for them, adapted to their qualities and I think Dele feels very comfortable in this role, with freedom but following principles and things that we do in training.</p>
      <p>"So I think they're fine. We have a game in two days. I think we can go and win that match at home and qualify in the Champions League and I think the mood becomes high for the boys."</p>
