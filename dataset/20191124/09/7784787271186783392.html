      <h3>Goalkeeper Mark Birighitti has produced some crucial saves for Central Coast who have kept their first clean sheet in 39 A-League matches to beat Western United 1-0 in Gosford.</h3>
      <p>United created most of the chances, especially in Sunday evening’s first half, but were off target or denied by Birighitti.</p>
      <p>The sole goal came in the 49th minute when a shot from Giancarlo Gallifuoco deflected off United defender Aaron Calver.</p>

      <p>United had two penalty shouts for handball in the second half, but neither was given.</p>
      <p>It is the first time the Mariners have kept a side goalless since round 21 in February 2018.</p>
      <p>The new franchise suffered back-to-back losses for the first time and their first away defeat.</p>
      <p>The Mariners’ second win of the season lifts them from last to sixth, one spot and three points behind United.</p>

      <p>Central Coast started brightly with Tommy Oar putting an audacious chip just over the bar.</p>
      <p>From that point, United created the best first-half chances, with the visitors’ star imports all having attempts.</p>
      <p>Alessandro Diamanti had a free-kick saved by Birighitti and fired another fierce shot just wide, while Panagiotis Kone blazed over from close range and Ziggy Gordon cleared an Andrew Durante header off the line.</p>
      <p>United had further chances after halftime, with Besart Berisha missing one from close range and having another effort saved brilliantly before being replaced just after the hour.</p>

      <p>Sam Silvera shot straight at Filip Kurto and Jack Clisby almost doubled the Mariners’ lead, but his long-range attempt was tipped away superbly by Kurto. Birighitti preserved the lead by saving an 80th-minute effort from substitute Max Burgess and Diamanti fired another attempt wide.</p>
