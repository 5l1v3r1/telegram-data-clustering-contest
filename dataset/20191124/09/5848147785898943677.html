      <h1>R Kelly’s ex changes her tune and brands him the ‘daddy’ of all abusers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:45:35+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/erin-nyren/" target="_blank">Erin Nyren</a></address>
      <p>One of R.Kelly’s girlfriends has changed her tune, striking a harsh new note about the singer she formerly defended against multiple allegations of sexual abuse in three states.</p>
      <p>Joycelyn Savage opened up about her experience, saying that she is a victim of his sexual domination and psychological torture.</p>
      <p>Until recently, Ms Savage had been a loud proclaimer of Kelly’s innocence, saying that it was a gross injustice that he has been  behind bars since July.</p>

      <p>Savage, 24, has now recounted how the pair first met, what their early relationship was like, and how it allegedly devolved into controlling and invasive behaviour.</p>
      <p>She said the 52-year-old rapper flew her and a friend to California, promising that he’d help her realise her dreams of becoming a model and singer.</p>
      <p>She says he told her he could help her become like the late R&amp;B artist Aaliyah, who Kelly illegally married in 1994 when she was 15.</p>
      <p>“Robert told me so many lies my 19-year-old mind believed everyone of one them,” she now says.</p>
      <p>After a few months, Kelly began insisting that she always address him as “master” or “daddy.”</p>
      <p>Savage’s accounts are very similar to other girls and women who have claimed Kelly abused them, particularly in the <i>Lifetime</i> docuseries <i>Surviving R. Kelly</i>.</p>

      <p>Savage also wrote that he employed multiple assistants at his home. She says they never spoke to her, but watched her constantly, even as she showered.</p>
      <p>Telephone calls to her parents were not allowed to occur in private, and Savage says she was sometimes told what to say.</p>
      <p>“‘All this can stop today, you want a career?'” Kelly would allegedly ask her. “‘Or do you want to live a normal life?'”</p>
      <p>In the past Savage has said that she lived with Kelly willingly, and that her estranged parents’ claims he’d brainwashed her were false.</p>
      <p>Kelly has denied all claims of physical or sexual abuse and domestic violence.</p>
