      <p>The presidency has denied reports claiming that the federal government was planning to take over the electricity distribution companies (DisCos).</p>
      <p>Laolu Akande, a media aide attached to the office of the vice-president in a statement on Friday, November 22, faulted as misleading media reports that suggested that the recent <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277943-governor-el-rufai-appointed-head-committee-review-ownership-discos.html">meeting by the National Economic Council (NEC)</a> was related to the government's takeover of the DisCos</p>
      <p>The presidential aide clarified that the issue which came up for discussions at NEC meeting was about the quantum of state governments’ interests in the 40% shares retained by the Nigerian government in each of the DisCos at the point of privatisation.</p>

      <p>“<i>For the purposes of clarity and accurate records, the ONLY issue which came up for discussions at NEC yesterday was about the quantum of State governments’ interests, if any, in the 40% shares retained by the Nigerian Government in each of the DisCos at the point of privatization. A Committee was then constituted to review historical records and advise the Council accordingly,"</i> the statement read.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277293-senate-begins-probe-poor-power-supplies-by-electricity-companies.html">poor power supply to Nigerians is the current focus</a> of the Senate as the legislators have commenced an investigation into the activities of electricity generation and distribution companies in the country.</p>
      <p>The Senate asked its committee in charge of <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1256503-power-season-6-cast-episodes-where-to-watch.html">power</a> to commence the probe of these companies to unravel why they have failed the citizens in the area of effective power supply and report back to the red chamber within four weeks.</p>
