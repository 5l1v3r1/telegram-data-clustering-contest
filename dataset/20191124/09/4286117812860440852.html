      <p>The Bharatiya Janata Party and Ajit Pawar on Sunday got a 24-hour breather as the Supreme Court did not order an immediate floor test in Maharashtra as demanded by the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress.</p>
      <p>A bench of Justices N V Ramana, Ashok Bhushan, and Sanjiv Khanna instead asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to place before it letters of Maharashtra Governor BS Koshyari inviting Devendra Fadnavis to form the government and of Fadnavis staking claim.</p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>While the tripartite post-poll alliance of the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, represented by senior advocates, Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Manu Singhvi demanded an immediate floor test, the Supreme Court decided to review the matter further when the hearing resumes on Monday at 10.30 am.</p>
      <p>The top court also issued notices to Centre and Maharashtra government based on the petition filed by the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine against the Maharashtra governor's decision to swear in Fadnavis early on Saturday. Individual notices were also issued to Devendra Fadnavis and his deputy Ajit Pawar, who is NCP chief Sharad Pawar's nephew.</p>
      <p>
        <b>24-HOUR BREATHER</b>
      </p>
      <p>The top court's decision comes as a breather for Ajit Pawar and Devendra Fadnavis as most of the NCP MLAs who had gone missing or were untraceable have returned to the party.</p>
      <p>According to NCP's Jayant Patil, they have the support of 51 MLAs, which leave only three including Ajit Pawar out of the equation. NCP had won 54 seats in the recent Maharashtra Assembly elections.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut also claimed on Sunday that the NCP-Sena-Cong combine has the support of at least 165 MLAs and that the BJP will not be able to prove a majority if an immediate floor test is conducted.</p>
      <p>Senior advocates Kapil Sibal and AM Singhvi reiterated this in court and demanded an immediate floor test to be conducted.</p>
      <p>Terming Maharashtra govenrnor's decision to revoke President's Rule at 5.47 am on Saturday as "bizarre", Singhvi said it was a "murder of democracy".</p>
      <p>On the other hand, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for two BJP MLAs and some independents, questioned the petition filed by NCP-Sena-Congress and said they should have approached the Bombay High Court.</p>
      <p>However, the petitioners stuck to their point and questioned how the Maharashtra governor allowed BJP to form the government in the state when they do not have the support of 51 NCP MLAs out of 54.</p>
      <p>"If Devendra Fadnavis has numbers to prove majority, let him prove it on the floor of House, else we have numbers to form the government in Maharashtra," Sibal said.</p>
      <p>Sibal also questioned BS Koshyari's decision to give BJP time till November 30 to prove its majority.</p>
      <p>"It is a complete betrayal and annihilation of democracy where the government has been allowed to be formed when 51 NCP MLAs are not with them," they submitted.</p>
      <p>
        <b>NCP ASKS AJIT PAWAR TO RETURN</b>
      </p>
      <p>Just ahead of the Supreme Court hearing today, NCP sources told India Today TV that extended family of Sharad Pawar is trying to convince Ajit Pawar to return to the party fold.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar's grandson Rohit Pawar and NCP MP Supriya Sule also appealed to Ajit Pawar to resign as Fadnavis's deputy and come back to the party.</p>
      <p>NCP's Jayant Patil also went to Ajit Pawar's residence to convince him to return to the party.</p>
      <p>However, no response or comment on the matter has come from Ajit Pawar, who was sacked as the party's legislative leader on Saturday following the Maharashtra coup.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WHAT NEXT?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The twist of fate in Maharashtra on Saturday forced NCP-Congress-Sena to relocate their MLAs to hotels fearing poaching by BJP.</p>
      <p>Senior leaders of Shiv Sena and NCP including Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray have reached the Renaissance Hotel in Powai, where the NCP leaders have been lodged. Both leaders are expected to request the MLAs to stick together as they fear that BJP may attempt to lure them away.</p>
      <p>Congress MLAs have also been shifted to JW Mariott while Sena MLAs have been sent to The Lalit.</p>
      <p>A series of hectic meetings are also expected throughout the day in Mumbai as leaders of Sena Congress and NCP discuss their future strategy in the wake of tomorrow's hearing in the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>BJP, on the other hand, said the Supreme Court's decision was a victory for them while NCP-Congress was humiliated over their petition. BJP's Ashish Shellar also exuded confidence that Devendra Fadnavis has the support of 170 MLAs and will prove his majority when the floor test is conducted.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE MAHARASHTRA TWIST SO FAR</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a stunning turn of events, Fadnavis on Saturday returned as chief minister propped up by Ajit Pawar, who took oath as his deputy, just hours after the new alliance of Shiv Sena, the NCP, and the Congress reached a consensus that Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray will be their chief ministerial candidate.</p>
      <p>Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar were sworn in by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari at a hush-hush ceremony in Mumbai moments after President's rule was lifted in the state.</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar's volte-face created fissures in the NCP and Sharad Pawar distanced himself from his nephew's dramatic action, saying the decision to back Fadnavis was Ajit's personal choice and not that of the party.</p>
      <p>On Saturday evening, the NCP removed Ajit Pawar as the party's legislature unit head, saying his move was not in line with the party's policies.</p>
      <p>The BJP and the Sena, which fought the last month's Assembly polls in an alliance, secured a comfortable majority by winning 105 and 56 seats respectively.</p>
      <p>The Sena, however, broke its three-decade-long ties with the BJP after the latter declined to share the chief minister's post.</p>
      <p>The Congress and the NCP, both pre-poll allies, won 44 and 54 seats respectively.</p>
      <p>(With inputs from PTI)</p>
