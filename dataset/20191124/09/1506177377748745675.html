      <p>Greek Australian actor and comedian, Nick Giannopoulos has warned other comedians to stop using the word “wog”, stating that he would take legal action if they use that phrase to promote their shows.</p>
      <p>The comments were made to <a href="https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/nick-giannopoulos-puts-fellow-comedians-on-notice-for-using-wog-in-shows/news-story/80575aa587b21a4d58f9818cfc03424c">The Herald Sun</a> on Saturday, explaining that “My trademarks are wogs or wogboys… My lawyers have been hired by me to protect my trademark.”</p>
      <p>“The Wog Boy” of Australia added that “the government ruled in my favour in the mid-90s saying the word “wogs” is associated with my previous shows…They granted me that trademark so that I could protect my business interests.”</p>
      <p>Nick Giannopoulos rose to fame after playing the character of Jim on the 1990s sitcom Acropolis Now, whom he stared alongside Mary Coustas, who played his cousin known as Effie Stephanides<i>.</i></p>
      <p>In 2017 during an interview with radio hosts Kyle and Jackie O, he revealed that he trademarked the phrase because he “wanted to take that word, that word that had been used against me my whole childhood, and claim ownership of it…The word I hated the most in the world, I now own.”</p>
      <p>Nick has also stared in the film ‘The Wog Boy’ (2000) and sequel ‘Wog Boys 2: Kings of Mykonos’ (2010) and had many successful stage shows including Wog Boys, Wog-A-Rama, Wog Story and Star Wogs.</p>
