      <p>This is <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/look-back/">"Look Back,"</a> a feature that I plan to do for at least all of 2019 and possibly beyond that (and possibly forget about in a week, who knows?). The concept is that every week (I'll probably be skipping the four fifth weeks in the year, but maybe not) of a month, I will spotlight a single issue of a comic book that came out in the past and talk about that issue (often in terms of a larger scale, like the series overall, etc.). Each week will be a look at a comic book from a different year that came out the same month X amount of years ago. The first week of the month looks at a book that came out this month ten years ago. The second week looks at a book that came out this month 25 years ago. The third week looks at a book that came out this month 50 years ago. The fourth week looks at a book that came out this month 75 years ago.</p>

      <p>Today, we look at the silliness that was November 1994's debut of...Extreme Justice!</p>
      <p>Now, don't get me wrong, let me open this up right away by saying that Dan Vado was stepping into a rough situation when he took over writing duties on Justice League America in 1994. The series had started as the "Bwah Ha Ha Ha" era of the Justice League and when the original writers on the series, Keith Giffen and J.M. DeMatteis left the book, Dan Jurgens took it over with the intent to do the book as a more traditional superhero group. However, Jurgens was stuck with the cast of the book that was already there, plus the addition of Superman. So basically, you had the funny cast with the intention of making it more traditional superheroics. In other words, you weren't making ANY one happy because the book was still the funny cast, so the traditional superhero fans weren't interested in characters who had been established in one way for five years and the fans of the funny book weren't interested because now the same characters were all acting much more serious.</p>
      <p>Then Superman famously was killed off and Jurgens revamped the book with a new cast, a cast that mostly didn't stick around. So by the time Dan Vado took over the series, it was a mish-mosh of a cast and a team that really didn't have much of a voice.</p>
      <p>Vado reintroduced Captain Atom into the series, now working as a government agent...</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Here's how bad things were. Kevin West was drawing this book and Guardians of the Galaxy for Marvel (Ken Branch inked him on this book). He had to drop one of the titles and he chose to drop Justice League America! That's pretty embarrassing when you'd rather draw the Guardians of the Galaxy instead of the Justice League.</p>
      <p>#85 was his last issue...</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>In the next issue, a new artist took over, Marcelo "Marc" Campos, working with Ken Branch and Kevin Conrad.</p>
      <p>Campos was a peer of Mike Deodato and Deodato later noted that Campos getting the Justice League assignment is what led to Deodato applying to be the artist on Wonder Woman.</p>
      <p>Campos was a dynamic artist, although he was perhaps a bit on the raw side, as some of his figure work was sorely lacking (Deodato, on the other hand, came to DC a lot more formed as an artist - and Deodato himself has grown tremendously from those early Wonder Woman days). Check out his debut, which also shows how sad the book was, as they dedicate a few pages just to Superman turning them down for picking up membership on the team now that he is alive again...</p>

      <p>In the same issue, we see Captain Atom be his typical "tough guy take charge" attitude...</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And we see the introduction of a new version of the Amazing Man, the grandson of a character Roy Thomas had created during his All-Star Squadron days (as a retroactive black superhero in the DC Universe during the 1940s)...</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/justice-league-america-86-6.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=1486&amp;dpr=1.5"/>

      <p>Anyhow, Zero Hour comes along and there are three Justice League titles. Justice League America (by Vado, Campos and Conrad), Justice League International (by Gerard Jones, Chuck Wojtkiewicz and Bob Dvorak), a quirky book that was once Justice League Europe and Justice League Task Force (by Sal Velluto and Jeff Albrecht and rotating writers), a book starring Martian Manhunter and Gypsy going on missions with different superhero configurations each issue (the book was launched by writer David Michelinie but had a different writing team for each mission).</p>
      <p>DC decides to revamp their Justice League titles. Jones and Wojtkiewicz bring their quirky stuff to the main title, Justice League Task Force becomes a "Martian Manhunter training young heroes" series and Vado and Campos get to launch their own new series.</p>
      <p>The problem is that while the other two series launched alongside DC's August Zero month...</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/starman-0.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=1492&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Extreme Justice #0 is delayed for whatever reason and doesn't come out until November, without the Zero Hour trade dress, of course...</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/extreme-justice-0-0.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=1476&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>So, during the Justice League crossover Judgement Day, which led to the teams all breaking up, Booster Gold was killed, but since all death and life on Earth had been frozen by a powerful being known as the Overmaster, Booster got to continue to fight until the heroes won, at which point Blue Beetle had turned his armor into a machine that kept his heart beating. Essentially, it was the Tony Stark concept once again.</p>
      <p>So Captain Atom decides that there needs to be a proactive Justice League that can keep an eye out on the rest of the heroes and also take care of stuff that the other heroes wouldn't touch due to red tape, etc. For some reason, this new idea appealed to Booster and Beetle and also Amazing Man, mostly because the character had been introduced by Vado, so, well, he was taking him for this new book, consarnit!</p>
      <p>Here is the team in action...</p>

      <p>Campos (inked by Ken Branch) had definitely improved, but the book was still more than a bit too busy. The characters didn't really make any sense together and the book failed to have any real direction. For a "proactive" team, they mostly just reacted to outside threats the same as any other team. An alternate version of Captain Atom who had become the Monarch became the main villain working behind the scenes in the early issues.</p>
      <p>Their second storyline brought a revamped Firestorm to the group (Ronnie Raymond could now become Firestorm by himself)...</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Campos was off the book by #7...</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/extreme-justice-7.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=1465&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>And Vado was gone by #8...</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/extreme-justice-8.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=1462&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The incoming writers did their best with the concept, but, again, there wasn't much THERE there, so the book was canceled with #18 (just in time for Grant Morrison to revamp the Justice League much more successfully in JLA).</p>
      <p>If you have any suggestions for November (or any other later months) 1994, 1969 and 1944 comic books for me to spotlight, drop me a line at brianc@cbr.com! Here is the guide, though, for the cover dates of books so that you can make suggestions for books that actually came out in the correct month. Generally speaking, the traditional amount of time between the cover date and the release date of a comic book throughout most of comic history has been two months (it was three months at times, but not during the times we're discussing here). So the comic books will have a cover date that is two months ahead of the actual release date (so October for a book that came out in August). Obviously, it is easier to tell when a book from 10 years ago was released, since there was internet coverage of books back then.</p>
