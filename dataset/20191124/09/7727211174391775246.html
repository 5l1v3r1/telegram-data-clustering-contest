Me and my daughter were in a queue to watch Frozen, loads of little kids there, all dressed up and everything, then these girls jumped on another girl and loads of these kids just started fighting.</p>
      <p>"Armed police came with Tasers. All the people that were fighting run off into the cinema. There’s about 15 to 20 police cars. I’m shaking."</p>

      <p>Witnesses claimed the youths were scrapping over new film Blue Story.</p>
      <p>The film, released on Friday, explores gang culture in southeast London and the dynamic between young people in the capital.</p>
      <p>Mr Khan, manager of Pepe’s Restaurant at Star City told <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/one-scariest-moments-life-moment-17306756">BirminghamLive</a>:  "I heard shouting and screaming outside the restaurant. I understand a big fight started in the cinema.</p>
      <p>"There were so many people running past the restaurant, I’d say around 60 to 70 were involved.</p>
      <p>"The police escorted everyone out. We’ve heard that the cinema has had to empty the screens and are not letting anyone else in. I guess people who have bought tickets will get a refund."</p>
