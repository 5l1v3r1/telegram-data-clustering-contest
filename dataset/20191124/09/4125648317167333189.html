These airstrikes reportedly paved the way for the Syrian Arab Army’s (SAA) 25th Special Mission Forces (formerly Tiger Forces) to advance at the town of Musharifah Al-Shmaliyah. A source near the battlefront told Al-Masdar that the Syrian Army captured the town after the main defensive line for the jihadist rebels collapsed on Sunday morning.
