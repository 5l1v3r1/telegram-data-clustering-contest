        <b>A RANGERS fan has pranked Boli Bolingoli with a picture of his BUM - after the Celtic star slid into his girlfriend's DMs.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Belgian defender contacted fitness fanatic Emma Lonsdale, 23, in the early hours of Friday morning when he sent her a loveheart emoji on Instagram.</p>

      <p>He complimented her on her physique but the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> ace got more than he bargained for when Emma's boyfriend Richard Lind, 29, replied later that day.</p>
      <p>During the hilarious conversation, Richard - posing as Emma - told Bolingoli that she'd just finished off a session at the gym.</p>
      <p>When Bolingoli said she looked like she was working hard on her bum, Richard asked if he wanted to see a better picture of it.</p>
      <p>He then sent the defender an image of his <b>OWN</b> bum, but with Bolingoli then questioning whether it was Emma, Richard sent another full-body image to reveal it was actually him.</p>

      <p>Speaking exclusively to <i>SunSport</i>, the couple, from Glasgow, lifted the lid on the funny interaction and highlighted that the Belgian even shared a laugh with them about it.</p>
      <p>Richard said: "I was at work and Emma sent me a screenshot and we just kind of played it from there.</p>
      <p>"We just carried it on as we got home and then just sent the photos!</p>
      <p>"We didn't want to put it on anything but then I started getting random messages from a few boys saying it was in their work group chat, and that it was going wild."</p>
      <p>Emma added: "Richard had sent it to his small group chat and they've obviously sent it on and it's been spread about.</p>
      <p>"I've been getting messages off people that I don't even know like, 'this is so funny, it's in my group chat and I didn't realise it's your boyfriend'.</p>
      <p>"I've been like, 'what?'"</p>

      <p>Richard, a big <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> fan, couldn't resist the chance to have a laugh at a Celtic player's expense, but praised Bolingoli for being a good sport.</p>
      <p>He said: "I'm a Rangers fan so I thought right, we'll have a laugh with this.</p>
      <p>"The majority of my pals are Rangers fans so it was just about having a laugh, and it's just went wild since then.</p>
      <p>"He was a good sport with it. He'll get pounded for it for a laugh and that'll be it. If it got done to me I'd be absolutely howling!"</p>
      <p>Images of the conversation have been liked nearly 3,000 times on Twitter while Emma has gained around 200 more followers on her Instagram account.</p>
      <p>And while it has mostly been Rangers fans reacting to it, they aren't the only ones.</p>
      <p>Richard added: "People have been saying it's brilliant. A few Rangers pages have shared it and hundreds of Rangers fans have been liking it.</p>
      <p>"A Bolingoli page actually liked it as well!"</p>
      <p>SunSport have contacted Celtic and Bolingoli for comment.</p>
