        <b>This Anees Bazmee multi-starrer gets a thumbs down from the audience, despite a solo release at the box-office. Pagalpanti mints only Rs 6.25 crore on Saturday totaling up the collection to Rs 11.25 crore. The movie is facing huge competition from the animated movie Frozen 2. Frozen which opened on 3.35 crore, doubled up to 6.75 crore on Saturday</b>

      <p>Anees Bazmee’s multi-starrer <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/tags/pagalpanti">Pagalpanti</a> is having hard time at the box office. Starring Anil Kapoor, John Abraham, Pulkit Samrat, Kriti Kharbanda, Pooja Hegde, Urvashi Rautela; opened on a poor note and continues to follow the same on the weekend as well. Opening with Rs. 5 crore, it has escalated to only Rs. 6.25 crore on Saturday as per reports in Box office India.com. Though Anees got Anil-John together on the silver screen, he failed to create the magic and give that entertainment dose to the audience.<br/><br/>Moreover, this comic caper was supposed to clash with Yeh Saali Aashiqui, but the movie was pushed ahead at the last minute. Despite of a solo release, this multi-starrer is finding it hard to get footfalls in the cinemas. This brings the total collection of the movie to Rs. 11.25 crore. Meanwhile animated movie, Frozen 2 is rapidly racing ahead at the box office, opening on Rs. 3.25 crore, it doubled up on Saturday to Rs.6.75 crore. The movie now stands at Rs. 10 crore.

      <p>He further mentioned in his review, “First, the 64-million dollar question: What was going on? Second, the million-dollar question: Did the producers (T-Series and Anand Pandit) not realise at any point that what was being made needed to be stopped? What a waste of time, money and resources-actually, quite a distinct feature in almost every sphere of life with the kind of mediocrity that has set in around us.”</p>
