        <b>Michael van Gerwen’s 9-darter against Adrian Lewis at the Players Championship Finals was the 22nd of his career, going level with Phil Taylor at the top of the list of perfect legs.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The world number one fired in 180, 177, 144 in the eighth leg of his second round clash in Minehead, going on to beat Jackpot 6-5.</p>
      <p>The few seconds of magic came out of nowhere, with the Dutchman not playing at his best beforehand, ending the match with an average of just 96.40.</p>
      <p>It was the first televised 9-darter of 2019, with the last coming at last year’s Grand Slam of Darts when Dimitri van den Bergh managed perfection against Stephen Bunting.</p>
      <p>There have been plenty away from the cameras this year, though, with 33 perfect legs being thrown on the main tour in non-televised events.</p>

      <p>MVG himself has hit three already, nailing 9-darters at Players Championship 2 and 3 in February and again at the European Darts Open in March.</p>

      <p>‘The nine-darter is always nice,’ said the world champ. ‘Adrian was pushing me and put me under pressure, so you have to do the right things at the right moments.</p>
      <p>‘It’s only one leg and I’ve got to be better tonight, because if you give the other guys a finger they take your whole hand and you can’t afford any mistakes.’</p>
      <p>MVG was better later on, beating James Wade 10-6 in the third round with a vastly improved average of 105.96.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old now takes on Mervyn King in the quarter-finals on Sunday, with the semi-finals and final all played on the same day.</p>
      <p>Van Gerwen and Taylor are well ahead of the field when it comes to 9-darters, with Lewis being third on the list with 12 perfect legs, followed by Dave Chisnall on 11 and both Raymond van Barneveld and Simon Whitlock on nine.</p>
      <p>However, Taylor is still ahead of the game in televised 9-darters as this was only MVG’s sixth, while the Power is on 11.</p>
