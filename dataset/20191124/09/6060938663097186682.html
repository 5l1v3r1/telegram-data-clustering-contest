      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/reliance-communications">Reliance Communications</a> (RCom) on Sunday said its lenders have rejected the resignation of chairman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anil-Ambani">Anil Ambani</a> and four other directors, and asked them to cooperate in the ongoing corporate insolvency resolution process.</p>
      <p>Ambani, along with four directors — Ryna Karani, Chhaya Virani, Manjari Kacker and Suresh Rangachar — had resigned from the company earlier this month. The company is going through insolvency proceedings following an application filed by Swedish telecom gear maker <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ericsson">Ericsson</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/National-Company-Law-Tribunal">National Company Law Tribunal</a> has handed over control of the company to an insolvency resolution professional. Sources estimate that RCom Group’s total secured debt is around Rs 33,000 crore. Lenders had submitted claims of around Rs 49,000 crore in August.</p>
      <p>RCom had posted a consolidated loss of Rs 30,142 crore for the September 2019 quarter due to provisioning for liabilities after the Supreme Court’s ruling on statutory dues. This had marked the second-highest loss posted by any Indian corporate till date, after Vodafone Idea’s Rs 50,921 crore loss.</p>
      <p>During July-September 2019, RCom set aside Rs 28,314 crore on account of provisioning following the Supreme Court order on calculation of annual adjusted gross revenue of telecom companies.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Bharti Airtel, RIL, UV Asset Reconstruction Company, Varde Partners and I Squared Capital are likely to bid for RCom’s assets on Monday, the last date for submission, according to sources. RCom’s committee of creditors will also meet on the same day to open bids.</p>
      <p>RCom has put all its assets for sale, including spectrum holding of 122 MHz, towers business, optical fibre network and data centres.</p>
