      <h1>‘No Capitulation’ — Bitcoin Miners Completely Unfazed by Price Drop</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:16:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:16</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) is not seeing capitulation among <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-mining">miners</a> despite its price <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-drops-below-73k-as-china-vows-to-dispose-of-exchanges">dipping over 15%</a> in the past week, new data suggests.</p>
      <p>According to estimates of Bitcoin’s hash rate from monitoring resource <a href="https://coin.dance/blocks/hashrate/linear">Coin Dance</a>, participation remains as strong now as before the price drop. Hash rate refers to the amount of computing power dedicated to maintaining the Bitcoin network.</p>
      <h3>Hash rate sees 2nd all-time high</h3>
      <p>According to some measures, the hash rate on Nov. 23, in fact, nearly matched its previous all-time high. At 134 quintillion hashes per second, Saturday’s reading was almost identical to that from Oct. 10, Coin Dance statistics suggest.</p>
      <p>BTC/USD traded at around $7,200 on that day, compared to $8,600 in October. </p>

      <p>Previously, Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-may-hit-4-500-but-miners-have-mostly-capitulated-analysts">reported</a> on the rising consensus that Bitcoin miners were exiting their positions as losses mounted. According to statistician Willy Woo, that process had already almost completed as of this week. </p>
      <p>Taking an opposing position based on the fresh data, entrepreneur <a href="https://twitter.com/alistairmilne/status/1198304416136388609">Alistair Milne</a> suggested miners were in fact little concerned with current price action. </p>
      <p>“There is NO miner capitulation,” he summarized in a tweet on Sunday. He continued: </p>
      <blockquote>“They are acutely aware of the upcoming halving and are apparently unphased by the recent dip.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Difficulty reverses upwards</h3>
      <p>Milne also linked to the rising difficulty in mining Bitcoin, an indicator which until recently had been in decline. </p>
      <p>The difficulty is a measure of the effort required to solve Bitcoin block equations and regularly adjusts to suit current miner sentiment. Earlier this month, difficulty saw its biggest drop of the year, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-sees-biggest-2019-drop-as-hash-rate-spikes">falling 7%</a>. Since then, a roughly 2% uptick likewise contradicts the idea that miners are staying away, according to <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/difficulty">Blockchain</a> figures. </p>

      <p>For analyst PlanB, creator of the highly-popular Stock-to-Flow Bitcoin price model, difficulty trends also point to continued faith in mining profitability.</p>
      <p>“+2% difficulty adjustment: no miner capitulation,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1197582827069591553">wrote</a> on Friday, adding the historical precedent called for a price rise after such behavior.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://diff.cryptothis.com/">Crypto This’</a> real-time difficulty generator, the next adjustment on Dec. 5 could be almost 5% higher than current levels.</p>
      <p>Unlike difficulty, the hash rate is difficult to estimate beyond a limited degree of accuracy, and should not be taken as a definitive guide to miner involvement.</p>
