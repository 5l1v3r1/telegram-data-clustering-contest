        <b>West Ham are ready to go one step ahead of Arsenal and Wolves by making a move for Southampton defender Cedric Soares in January, TEAMtalk understands.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 28-year-old, whose contract at St. Mary’s runs out at the end of the season, has made only five Premier League appearances this season with Yan Valery preferred at right-back by boss Ralph Hasenhuttl when the club opt for a back four.</p>
      <p>TEAMtalk understands that Soares has informed the Saints of his desire not to sign a new deal on the south coast with the Hammers, Arsenal and Wolves all keen.</p>
      <p>However, while the latter two clubs have enquired about the possibility of signing the right-back, it is West Ham who are set to go ahead with a January bid.</p>
      <p>Soares will become a free agent in the summer and an offer could tempt Southampton into selling up, given that they otherwise face the prospect of losing him for nothing.</p>
      <p>Soares – a 33-cap Portugal international – joined Southampton from Sporting in 2015 and has made 126 appearances for the club to date, chipping in with three goals and 10 assists in that time.</p>
