      <h1>Felix Auger-Aliassime to make Davis Cup Finals debut in final vs. Spain</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:51:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/author/ryan-mckenna/" target="_blank">Ryan McKenna</a></address>
      <p>Felix Auger-Aliassime will make his Davis Cup Finals debut for Canada on Sunday in the first singles rubber against Spain.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old from Montreal sat out the start of the week with an ankle injury suffered last month, but has been healthy for the last few days.</p>
      <p>Canada captain Frank Dancevic has used Vasek Pospisil in his first singles rubber of every tie until that point and he won every single match until Saturday’s semifinal against Russia.</p>
      <p>Auger-Aliassime, ranked No. 21, will face Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut for a chance to gain an early advantage in the championship tie.</p>
      <p>Denis Shapovalov will then face No. 1 Rafael Nadal in the second singles rubber.</p>
      <p>Should a doubles rubber be needed to decide a winner, Pospisil will slot in beside Shapovalov. The duo teamed up to beat Russia in three sets on Saturday to advance.</p>
