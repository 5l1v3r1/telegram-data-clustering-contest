      <h1>“The sign of champions, winning ugly” – Roy Keane says Liverpool win will upset City</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T09:24:02+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 09:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United legend Roy Keane has admitted that Liverpool have shown they have the “<b>sign of champions</b>” by defeating Crystal Palace 2-1 over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The Reds were hard pressed in the game, with nothing but credit to Palace, but kept the pressure on and eventually grabbed a late winner through Bobby Firmino.</p>
      <p>There was some controversy over a goal by the hosts being ruled out by VAR, but when isn’t there an issue when the Reds win yet again?</p>
      <p>But Keane didn’t have any time for that, and got straight down to the facts – Liverpool have won another game, having only dropped points to Manchester United, away from home, this season, and people are starting to talk about the title.</p>
      <p>“<b>It was a tricky game for Liverpool,</b>” <a href="https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2019/11/24/roy-keane-impressed-by-liverpools-win-at-crystal-palace/">Keane told Sky Sports (via HITC).</a> “<b>Going down to Palace, after the international break and they will be looking at the game where a few decisions went their way. I’ll go back to what I said, it was a great win for Liverpool.</b></p>
      <p>“<b>It’s the sign of champions, winning ugly and that’s a great sign. It would keep going [on his message when Manchester United were chasing down Newcastle in the late ’90s].</b></p>
      <p>“<b>People think there are big speeches every week or words of wisdom from everyone at the training ground. It’s not. It’s keep your head down and try to keep winning football matches and what you are in control of. Of course, City would have been upset with Liverpool winning late on.</b>”</p>
      <p>It’s hardly a surprise that people are talking about Liverpool as if we’re champions-elect, given the current form we are in.</p>
      <p>If we simply carry on performing around about as well as we have, and continue to win ugly, as Keane put it, then surely we’ll be in an enviable position by the time 2020 kicks off.</p>
