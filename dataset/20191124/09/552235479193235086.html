      <p>Dogs who have been injured or abandoned now have a place to relax in peace thanks to a special garden at Hamilton’s rescue centre.</p>
      <p>The Scottish SPCA has unveiled a new sensory garden for dogs at their base on the town’s Bothwell Road.</p>
      <p>Scotland’s animal welfare charity cares for thousands of abused, injured or abandoned animals each year.</p>
      <p>Some of the dogs are from illegal puppy farms or environments where they haven’t been able to express natural behaviours. Often they have not experienced anything other than a kennel environment.</p>
      <p>Centre manager Gillian Boyle said: “The garden is full of different dog-friendly plants and scents which encourage them to use their senses. This provides physical and mental stimulation within the surroundings.</p>
      <p>“The garden also includes different surfaces and textures, along with recycled tyres and plastic bottles, which create an element of fun for the dogs, as well as many other objects to keep them entertained.</p>
      <p>“We’ve designed this area to incorporate many different experiences for the dogs, including a safe, quiet space for them to relax in.</p>
      <p>“Our centre in Glasgow opened their sensory garden last year and since opening, the team have witnessed positive changes in the confidence levels of the dogs, especially those that came from puppy farms. It would appear that this has been enriching for the dogs.</p>
      <p>“We’re so grateful to all those who have contributed to our new sensory garden. We believe this will greatly enhance the dogs’ behaviours whilst in our care and moving forward into their forever homes.”</p>
      <p>The creation of the garden was made possible due to the kind monetary donation and staff involvement of Tesco (bags of help), JenFlow systems and Cadzow Bridge Building Supplies as well as Argyll Holidays and kind donations from the public.</p>
