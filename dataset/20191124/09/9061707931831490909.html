      <h2>It gave him a last lease of life</h2>

      <p>A Derby woman has given an emotional thanks to the hospice who gave her dying dad a last lease of life.</p>
      <p>Louise Mellor, 34, said the care her father received at the Treetops Hospice during his final months "helped him to live while he was dying".</p>
      <p>She said her 70-year-old dad, Dennis Mellor, would always make an effort to go to the hospice even when he struggled to get out of bed.</p>
      <p>When her father, who died in February, was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, Miss Mellor said it came as a massive shock.</p>
      <p>She said: "Dad had a really bad cough which initially was thought to be a chest infection but within a couple of months, he was diagnosed with Mesothelioma."</p>
      <p>Mesothelioma is a rare form of incurable lung cancer and Mr Mellor was given between three to nine months to live.</p>
      <p>"We decided as a family that weâ€™d assume it was three months, because then we would make every day count up to then," Miss Mellor said.</p>
      <p>Once he had been diagnosed, she said her father accepted it quickly because he wanted to make the most of the time he had left.</p>

      <p>"It was inspiring and his attitude helped me to accept his diagnosis, we had always been close, my mum used to say were were like peas in a pod," she said.</p>
      <p>After researching places where her dad could go to improve his quality of life, Miss Mellor found the Treetops Hospice in Risley.</p>
      <p>Mr Mellor started visiting Treetops every week and his daughter said it made a huge difference to his life.</p>
      <p>"My dad looked forward to going, he would come back so excited to tell us all about what he'd done each week.</p>
      <p>"It was somewhere he went where he could still be himself, not his illness," Miss Mellor said.</p>
      <p>As well as talking "a lot about the food", Mr Mellor tried things that he "would never have" before like Reiki and therapeutic massage.</p>
      <p>Miss Mellor said: "It was so nice to see him happy and that helped me to cope a little better."</p>
      <p>It was only when the illness took hold that Miss Mellor said she realised just how important Treetops was to her father.</p>
      <p>She said it kept him going, even on days when he wouldn't have been able to get out of bed, Treetops arranged transport for him.</p>
      <p>"He kept setting himself little goals and one of his last goals was to have Christmas dinner at Treetops.</p>
      <p>"It was just as important to him as having Christmas with me and mum," she said.</p>
      <p>Mr Mellor made it to the Christmas dinner but that was the last time he visited the hospice.</p>
      <p>"Treetops helped dad to live while he was dying, they were a massive part of his last year of life and whatever he needed, nothing was too much trouble.</p>
      <p>"I genuinely can't thank them enough."</p>
      <p>Miss Mellor urged people to support their local hospice so that the "amazing gift" could be there for other families.</p>
