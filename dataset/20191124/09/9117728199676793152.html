        <b>Two-time F1 champion Mika Hakkinen believes that the incident which occurred at the Brazilian Grand Prix between teammates <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/charles-leclerc">Charles Leclerc</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> will only cause problems for the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> team principal Mattia Binotto.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The pair clashed towards the end of the race in Brazil last weekend which resulted in both finishing outside the points, hampering their chances of securing third in the drivers' championship.</p>
