      <h3>Valentine Holmes is officially back in rugby league.</h3>
      <p>North Queensland announced late Sunday evening the 24-year-old has signed a big six-year deal with the NRL club.</p>
      <p>He will return from the US after being cut by NFL franchise New York Jets.</p>
      <p>Holmes sensationally walked away from his contract with Cronulla last year to chase a dream in American football.</p>
      <p>Ultimately that failed, and he couldn’t resist the lure or rugby league riches bringing him “home” to Townsville.</p>
      <p>He played 105 NRL games with the Sharks after debuting in 2014, and was essential to their 2016 premiership season.</p>
      <p>He’s also represented Queensland and Australia and was considered one of the best young players in the game before leaving.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys have been crying out for some top-end talent to help the team improve on a couple of dire seasons on the trot.</p>
      <p>“This is a wonderful signing for our club,” Cowboys director of football Peter Parr said.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t long ago that Valentine was one of the best players in the competition before his courageous decision to go to the NFL. His form in 2018 was as good as any player in the NRL, particularly in the second half of that season.</p>
      <p>“He’s a proven big game player, he’s won a grand final and he’s played some terrific football for both Queensland and Australia.</p>
      <p>“Valentine has been a top-class performer at wing and fullback and we’ve made no secret we had a desire to strengthen our outside back stocks.”</p>
