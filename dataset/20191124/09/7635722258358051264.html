        <b>The latest political opinion poll has seen a drop in support for Fine Gael.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The party dropped two points to 30% in the Business Post/Red C poll – but still remains the most popular in the country.</p>
      <p>Fianna Fáil is unchanged at 26%.</p>
      <p>Labour has picked up a two point boost from its recent national conference in Mullingar. And now sits on 6%.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin is still stuck on 11% despite holding its Ard Fheis in Derry last weekend.</p>
      <p>The Green Party is unchanged on 7%.</p>
      <p>It comes ahead of four by-elections due to be held on Friday and the upcoming General Election, likely to be held in the first half of next year.</p>
      <p>The drop in support for Fine Gael comes after its Wexford by-election candidate Verona Murphy twice had to apologise for linking asylum seekers to Islamic State.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil has had issues with its Dublin Fingal candidate Lorraine Clifford Lee who has apologised for racist and offensive tweets she posted in 2011.</p>
      <p>Support for independent TDs has dropped by one point to 12%, while the Independent Alliance is unchanged on 4%.</p>
      <p>The Social Democrats remain unchanged on 2% while Solidarity People-Before Profit are up one on 2%.</p>
      <p>The Red C Poll was taken between last Thursday November 14th and Thursday November 21st.</p>
