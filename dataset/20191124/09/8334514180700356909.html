      <p>Britons vote in a parliamentary election on Dec. 12, with opinion polls showing the ruling Conservative Party led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson ahead of its challengers.</p>
      <p>“We will be balance day-to-day spending and we can still afford to borrow up to a limit for investment in economic infrastructure,” Javid said.</p>
      <p>“We are still clear that even with our program, our program for investment, that debt will be lower at the end of this parliament than at the start of parliament.”</p>
