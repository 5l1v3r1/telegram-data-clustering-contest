        <b>Disaster is something of a common occurrence in Albert Square, but a very different kind of disaster ensues in upcoming EastEnders episodes, as Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) carries out his plan of winning the ‘Best Pub’ competition — with a wife swap competition.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With plenty of stress on her plate, Linda (Kellie Bright) has been going through something of a rough time. Mick was determined to cheer her up with the ‘Best Pub’ competition.</p>
      <p>However, when she wasn’t all that interested, the Queen Vic landlord came up with a winning idea — a Walford Wife Swap.</p>

      <p>In the coming episodes, Mick orchestrates his plans for the wife swap competition, and as the day of the event arrives, he hopes that everything runs smoothly. Mind you — given that this is Walford we’re talking about — that was never going to happen.</p>
      <p>Everyone gathers at The Vic to hear the outcomes, but Gray (Toby-Alexander Smith) isn’t too chuffed about the whole thing, and thus he sets about sabotaging the results. However, how he attempts to do so remains to be seen.</p>

      <p>Later, Ruby move into The Vic to stay with Mick and Ollie, while Kat (Jessie Wallace) moves in with Patrick (Rudolph Walker), and Kush (Davood Ghadami) ends up with Sheree (Suzette Llewellyn).</p>
      <p>However, living with Patrick proves rather difficult for Kat, and thus she tells Kush to put an end to the whole thing.</p>
      <p>With plenty of new dynamics set to be explored as a result of the wife swap competition, there’ll no doubt be plenty of conflict ahead!</p>
