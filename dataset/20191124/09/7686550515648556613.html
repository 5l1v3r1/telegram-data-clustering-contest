        <b>The Millwall tactic Swansea couldn't overcome</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tom Bradshaw was something of a surprise omission from the Lions' starting XI at the Liberty Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Welsh striker has scored seven goals so far this term, making him Millwall's top scorer.</p>
      <p>But he was sacrificed for the game in South Wales, with Gary Rowett opting to go for a more defensive approach while packing out the midfield when his side weren't in possession.</p>
      <p>And while Swansea saw 68% of the ball, they desperately struggled to cut through the visitors whose organisation left Steve Cooper's men somewhat bewildered.</p>

      <p>"We did work on a five-at-the-back system over the international break, and we saw opportunities where it could really help us away from home," said Rowett.</p>
      <p>"We did press too high at times which enabled a good side like Swansea to play through, but I don't think they caused us too many problems and we had the better of the chances.</p>
      <p>"Swansea have good rotations and good movements, so we did think packing the middle of the pitch could have worked, but in our shape here we did really limit them I thought.</p>
      <p>"When we had to defend, the back five and midfield two were very disciplined. Connor Mahoney and Jed Wallace were excellent getting us up the pitch - it was a bit of a gamble, but it paid off for us as we then had three pressing from the front rather than two, and there are great transition opportunities to get up the pitch."</p>
      <p>Tactically, Millwall got it spot on, and Swansea simply couldn't find a way to turn the odds in their favour.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sloppy passing proves costly</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Swans gave away possession on numerous occasions in the early stages, needlessly so which did little to lift the mood of the fans.</p>
      <p>And it's telling that five of the 10 outfield players that took to the field for the home side ended the match with a pass completion rate of lower than 80%.</p>
      <p>Ben Wilmot was the best performer in this department with an 89.9% completion rate.</p>
      <p>But Wayne Routledge (77.8%), Jake Bidwell (76.7%), Bersant Celina (76.1%), George Byers (75.2%) and Kyle Naughton (70.3%) all flattered to deceive when it came to passing, with captain Matt Grimes (80.4%) only just ending with a rate of better than four in five.</p>

      <p>These returns are far from disastrous, although it was often the timing of the mis-placed passes that drew moans and groans from the Jack Army.</p>
      <p>Positive field position was so often surrendered while swift counter attack opportunities went begging as a result of the Swans' sloppiness on the ball.</p>
      <p>It means Millwall were able to pounce on the loose ball at every opportunity while it also ensured by the time Swansea did get into the final third, the Lions were well organised to ensure their defence wasn't breached.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Poor home form explained?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Swansea have suffered only four defeats from their 17 league fixtures so far this season. But all of those have come on home soil.</p>
      <p>Cooper's men are the only side to boast an unbeaten away league record in the English Football League, but after winning all four of their home Championship matches in August, Swansea have claimed just four of the last 18 points on offer at the Liberty Stadium.</p>
      <p>And former Swan Andy Legg believes that Cooper's men have struggled to cope when the onus has been on them to take the game to their opponents at the Liberty.</p>

      <p>"When they play away from home, teams at home have got to go and press the ball, so when Swansea keep the ball at the back and try and entice players out, teams at home will go and press them," said Legg on the BBC's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000bl88">Call Rob</a> phone-in.</p>
      <p>"If you take today as an example, Millwall just sat in and didn't want to know about what Swansea did with the ball in their own half.</p>
      <p>"They just backed off, played with a 4-5-1 and just got behind the ball and made it difficult.</p>
      <p>"When you play away from home it absolutely suits you down to the ground."</p>
      <p>
        <b>The man who's earned a shot to impress</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Swans were lacklustre to say the least in the opening half against Millwall.</p>
      <p>Cooper responded by sending on Kristoffer Peterson for the second half, with Routledge being the man to make way.</p>
      <p>It was the Swedish winger's first taste of action since the 3-0 defeat to Brentford almost exactly a month earlier.</p>
      <p>And it didn't take long for Peterson to show his qualities, ones that Swansea were so desperately lacking against the Lions.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old's direct approach was certainly different to that of Routledge on the left flank, and his pace ensured he caused a few problems in the second 45.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Swansea's best chance of the game actually fell to Peterson who carved out the opening himself with a sublime turn on the edge of the box to escape the attention of his marker, only to be thwarted by Bartosz Bialkowski.</p>
      <p>The lack of a full pre-season along with an illness have both contributed to Peterson's failure to get regular minutes since making the move from Heracles to South Wales.</p>
      <p>Other changes aer likely to be made, but ex-Liverpool man Peterson deserves his chance to shine, either against Huddersfield Town or Fulham this week.</p>
