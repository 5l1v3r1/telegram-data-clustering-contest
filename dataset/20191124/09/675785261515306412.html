      <p>Paul Hollywood is certainly a creature of habit - after landing a new younger barmaid lover he decided to whisk her off to his favourite holiday spot - where he got married 20 years ago.</p>
      <p>Blue-eyed baker Paul is now reportedly dating barmaid Melissa Spalding - who at 36 is 12 years older than his ex Summer Monteys-Fullam.</p>
      <p>The dewy eyed pair were spotted holding hands at the Paphos resort Annabelle in Cyprus after booking an exclsuive sea view suite.</p>

      <p>Melissa is in charge of the Chequers Inn in Smarden, Kent, near Paul's former home he shared with Summer.</p>
      <p>It is believed Summer confronted Paul about his friendship with Melissa before they split.</p>
      <p>Paul was head chef at the resort 23 years ago when he met ex wife Alex - they wed two years later in 1998.</p>
      <p>She described their time in Cyprus as "incredibly happy" back in 2013.</p>

      <p>A source told The Sun: “It is a bit odd that he brought his new girlfriend to a place he had so many memories with his ex, including where their actual wedding took place."</p>
      <p>“They went for a Japanese meal one evening and came back holding hands. I think they want to stay low key so they haven’t been talking to guests.</p>

      <p>“They will be in the honeymoon stage. They certainly don’t seem to have eyes for anyone else.”</p>
      <p>Paul split from girlfriend Summer in August. Mirror Online has contacted Paul for a comment.</p>
