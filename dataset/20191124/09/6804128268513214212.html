      <h1>Andros Townsend names the Crystal Palace youngster with an exciting future</h1>
      <h2>The former Tottenham and Newcastle winger has taken a shine to one youg Eagle</h2>

      <p>Andros Townsend has named the Crystal Palace youngster who is exciting him most on the training pitches - Brandon Pierrick.</p>
      <p>At just 17 he is already impressing Townsend with his bravery when training with the first team under the watchful eye of Roy Hodgson. Stories of Palace's last breakthrough star Aaron Wan Bissaka facing off against Wilfired Zaha in training are well known, and the former Tottenham and Tottenham winger might have now have had his interest piqued once again.</p>
      <p>Townsend told the official Crystal Palace programme: "Quite a few of the players have caught my eye and come up and done themselves justice. But the main player I like at the moment is Brandon. I think that's because he's a tricky winger, he's trained with no fear and he's been looking to take on senior defenders and that reminds me of when I was a youngster.</p>
      <p>The young winger is the only player to have started every game for the under-23s this season and bagged a brace for the first team during pre-season against AFC Wimbledon. Pierrick appears to be taking it all in his stride and has appreciated Townsend's and efforts to help him so far.</p>
      <p>The under-23 star said: "It's a nice feeling hearing him say those sorts of things because he's obviously a top player. He's doing his thing on the pitch, I'm doing my thing and I hope one day we will be playing on the pitch together.</p>
      <p>"Whenever a player comes across to train with the first-team, Andros and a couple of the others are the ones to go to if you're feeling a bit by yourself; they will help integrate you."</p>
