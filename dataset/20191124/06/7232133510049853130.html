      <h3>Ethereum Price Weekly Analysis</h3>
      <p>This past week, Ethereum declined heavily after it broke the key $172 support against the US Dollar. ETH price traded below many key supports near the $170 and $165 levels.</p>
      <p>Moreover, there was a break below the $150 support and the price settled well below the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). A new multi-month low was formed near $138 and the price recently corrected higher.</p>
      <p>It broke the $145 and $150 resistance levels. Besides, Ethereum recovered above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $177 high to $138 low.</p>
      <p>However, the price seems to be facing a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/22/ethereum-eth-hits-final-bearish-target-whats-next/">strong resistance</a> near the $155 level. More importantly, there is a major breakout pattern forming with resistance near $152 on the 4-hours chart of ETH/USD.</p>
      <p>Therefore, an upside break above the $152 and $155 levels might push the price higher. An immediate resistance is near the $158 level. It represents the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $177 high to $138 low.</p>
      <p>The main resistance is near $160 and a connecting bearish trend line on the same chart. A clear break above the $155 and $160 resistance levels could start a decent recovery. In the mentioned case, the price could recover towards the $172 resistance.</p>
      <p>On the downside, an immediate support is near the $150 level. If there is a downside break below the $150 support, the price is likely to retest $140.</p>
      <p>Any further downsides may perhaps open the doors for a push towards the $132 and $130 support levels. The next major support is near the $125 level, where the bulls may emerge.</p>
