      <h1>Jeremie Frimpong reveals the Celtic legend he's been getting tips from as youngster's rise continues</h1>
      <h2>The exciting full-back put in a man of the match performance in Celtic's comprehensive win over Livngston.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Scott McDermott, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-mcdermott/</a></address>
      <p>Skipper <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-brown">Scott Brown</a> plays the role of a director in Celtic’s new Christmas advert.</p>
      <p>But even he had to take a back seat as he was upstaged by young upstart <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jeremie-frimpong">Jeremie Frimpong</a>’s virtuoso display.</p>
      <p>The former Manchester City kid’s acting skills might be a bit ropey, judging by that club video.</p>
      <p>But the 18-year-old was a star turn on the pitch in this comfortable win over Gary Holt’s side.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/james-forrest">James Forrest</a> helped himself to a double, with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/odsonne-edouard">Odsonne Edouard</a> also on the scoresheet, as Celtic avenged their defeat to Livi in October to move clear of Rangers at the top of the Premiership.</p>
      <p>Brown wasn’t far behind Frimpong in the man of the match stakes as he orchestrated from the middle of the park and hit the Hoops’ crucial second goal.</p>

      <p>But the little full-back, keeping Moritz Bauer out of the team, was relentless on the right.</p>
      <p>He bombed up and down all afternoon, as TWO Livi players – Steve Lawson and Aaron Taylor-Sinclair – couldn’t live with him.</p>
      <p>It’s early days in Frimpong’s Parkhead career but he already looks like a sound investment.</p>
      <p>After the game, boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> heaped praise on him and said: “Frimpong is amazing.</p>
      <p>“That performance is one of the best I’ve seen from a right-back at Celtic. It had everything, pace, power, assists, shots on goal, recovery runs, defending.</p>
      <p>“For a kid at 18 to come into a daunting environment like this – he’s handled it brilliantly.</p>
      <p>“His talent is unequivocal at the minute. He’s made us a better team, there’s no question about that.</p>
      <p>“We thought he’d be a good emerging talent, a development player. But meteorically, he’s come through.</p>
      <p>“It’s all down to him, no-one else. It was a team effort getting him, but his performances are down <br/>to him.</p>
      <p>“People think he struggles with height but he deals with it with great upper body strength.</p>
      <p>“He’s amazing with the ball and is a real find for us.</p>
      <p>“He’s contributing immensely right now and it’s his place to lose.”</p>

      <p>Frimpong is a buzz-bomb off the pitch as well as on it and he revealed he’s even been getting tips off legendary Hoops and Scotland right-back Danny McGrain.</p>
      <p>He said: “When I get on the pitch, I just do what I do best – attack and help the team out as much as I can.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully the manager will keep putting me in. If you want to play at the top you can’t be shy, you just have to go and play.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been ready for this all my life so it’s great. I enjoyed that a lot today.</p>
      <p>“When I first came here I spoke to Danny and he helped me a lot.”</p>
      <p>Frimpong was always going to start here for Celtic and there were no major surprises in either line-up. Lennon opted for Jonny Hayes ahead of Greg Taylor at left-back, while Tom Rogic got the nod over Olivier Ntcham in midfield.</p>
      <p>Livingston simply don’t change for anyone. Their robust 4-5-1 was set up by Holt to frustrate their hosts and Celtic had to deal with their physicality.</p>
      <p>Early on, there was a bit of needle and that livened up proceedings.</p>
      <p>Christopher Jullien couldn’t handle Livi striker Lyndon Dykes in that 2-0 loss in West Lothian and they renewed hostilities here, leaving a bit on each other when the ball was gone.</p>
      <p>Brown also had a nibble at the big Aussie seconds after Dykes had shoulder-charged him.</p>
      <p>Livi were only playing to their strengths – literally – but Celtic stood up to it.</p>

      <p>And on 20 minutes, they got their noses in front. Rogic picked out a pass for Edouard that Ricki Lamie will feel he should have cut out.</p>
      <p>Suddenly the in-form French striker was clean through and his sublime dinked finish beat keeper Matija Sarkic all ends up.</p>
      <p>It was a class finish from Edouard. Leigh Griffiths would later make his comeback from the bench for Lennon’s men – but he’s got a mammoth task trying to replace the former PSG kid.</p>
      <p>Livi couldn’t get themselves far enough up the pitch to trouble Celtic in the first half and Sarkic was kept busy.</p>
      <p>He denied Edouard before Rogic fired a shot over after terrific work from the effervescent Frimpong.</p>
      <p>Lennon was forced into a change shortly after the break when Taylor came on for the injured Hayes, but it didn’t upset their rhythm, with Brown pulling the strings.</p>
      <p>They needed a second goal to put Livi to bed and the skipper provided it.</p>
      <p>Ryan Christie’s pass found him just outside the box and his shot deflected off Jon Guthrie to deceive Sarkic.</p>
      <p>Brown’s rare goal prompted the biggest cheer of the day and Celtic’s players fed off it.</p>
      <p>They got a quick-fire third when Edouard sent Frimpong clear on goal – and when Sarkic saved his effort Forrest followed up to bury a volley.</p>

      <p>For Holt’s men it was now a case of keeping the score down, so the sight of Griffiths coming on as a sub wouldn’t have helped.</p>
      <p>The Scotland striker hasn’t played since August but he immediately looked a threat.</p>
      <p>He fizzed a shot over before his rustiness cost him a goal at the back post when his touch let him down.</p>
      <p>Sarkic, who’s been an excellent signing for Livingston, produced a super stop to thwart Christie.</p>
      <p>But he could do little to prevent Forrest making it 4-0 after great pressing play from his Scotland team-mate.</p>
      <p>That was plenty for Lennon’s team, who edged ahead in the Premiership – and passed the baton on to rivals Rangers today in the title race.</p>
