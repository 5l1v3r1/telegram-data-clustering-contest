      <p>Reece Jones did not realise the Audi Quattro had been stolen in London almost a month earlier when he was loaned it by a friend to get home after having a hair cut, a judge was told.</p>
      <p>But he knew he had neither insurance nor a valid driving licence after being released early from jail where he had been serving a sentence for robbery, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard.</p>

      <p>So the 24-year-old put his foot down when a police patrol started to follow him along Great Bridge Road, Tipton on the afternoon of October 4 after spotting the car was on false plates, said Mr Neil Ahuja, prosecuting.</p>
      <p>Alarmed witnesses estimated the £16,000 high-powered Audi was travelling at between 60 and 90mph on a wet surface as it flashed past them down the street and turned into Bradley Lane, Bradley, where Jones lost control and skidded into a garden wall after overtaking numerous vehicles.</p>
      <p>The crash demolished the wall, wrecked a set of electric gates - causing an estimated £5,000 damage - and wrote off the car, continued Mr Ahuja.</p>

      <p>Jones was trapped for around 30 minutes and had to be cut free by firefighters along with his passenger.</p>
      <p>The impact broke both legs of the defendant who is still on crutches.</p>
      <p>His passenger also needed hospital treatment but refused to release his medical records and declined to support the prosecution case, it was said.</p>

      <p>Traffic was brought to a standstill on Bradley Lane <a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-hubs/wolverhampton/bilston/2019/10/04/men-injured-after-car-strikes-wall-outside-bilston-homes/">as police shut the road in the aftermath of the crash.</a></p>
      <p>Mr Andrew Jackson, defending, said a friend allowed Jones, who had just had his hair cut, to drive the car in the rain not knowing it had been stolen.</p>
      <p>Jones, from Windsor Road, Tipton, who had 12 previous convictions, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and not having insurance or a valid licence and was jailed by Judge James Burbidge QC who told him: "Witnesses said you came out of nowhere and flew past them on wet roads at speeds of up to 80 or 90mph - and the inevitable happened.</p>
      <p>"You crashed causing £5,000 damage and writing off the £16,000 car."</p>
