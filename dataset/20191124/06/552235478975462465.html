      <h1>Scott Brown has no business returning to Scotland squad for Euro 2020 playoffs - Gordon Waddell</h1>
      <h2>Gordon thinks it would be unfair on the younger generation of midfielders if the Celtic skipper returned to the national fold.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Waddell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>Thanks but no thanks. The only four words Steve Clarke needs for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-brown">Scott Brown</a>.</p>
      <p>Unless the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> captain wants to grow six inches and turn himself into a centre-half in the next six months.</p>
      <p>Ideally, would Broony be in your team? Seven days out of seven – and twice on Sundays.</p>
      <p>If you said no to that question, you’ve just not been paying attention these past few years.</p>
      <p>He’s a guy who’s been the beating heart of a club who have won the lot.</p>
      <p>Whose leadership has been as important as a standard of play that rarely drops below an eight out of 10.</p>
      <p>This isn’t about that, though. This is about creating a set of standards for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> – and sticking to them.</p>

      <p>To be fair to Brown, he wasn’t being Billy Big-balls about it when he was asked. He wasn’t saying he should be picked, wasn’t saying he was better than what we have.</p>
      <p>Just that if the manager needed him, he’d have the conversation – because it’s the biggest regret of his career, not playing in a major finals.</p>
      <p>Which is exactly what it should be.</p>
      <p>We have 11 straight failed campaigns in our locker after the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> groups, the doggy life we’re nursing through the Nations League notwithstanding.</p>
      <p>Brown has earned his 55 caps in six of them. Like it or not, he and the generation he has come and gone with are tainted with international inadequacy. Damn right that should foster regret.</p>
      <p>But if the pick-and-choose brigade think they can come and go when the permanently outgoing tide of misery suddenly takes a turn for the better without them, they should generally be told to ram it.</p>
      <p>But if Clarke decides to take him up on it, who gets cast aside? Kenny McLean? Callum McGregor? Scott McTominay? Ryan Jack? After all, one of them has to go.</p>
      <p>One of the guys who turned up for the misery of Kazakhstan, endured the boos of San Marino – while Brown’s been on the golf course – doesn’t make the cut.</p>

      <p>Does that seem right?</p>
      <p>Listen, the argument that all that matters is you pick your best team stands pretty tall.</p>
      <p>If you’re the national manager, why cut off your nose to spite your face?</p>
      <p>At the same time, however, the short-term gain could destroy the long-term build. As soon as Broony rakes out the TaylorMades for the first international break of the next campaign, you need to go cap-in-hand back to the guy you shafted to make way for him.</p>
      <p>Some players may well welcome him with open arms but they’ll probably be the guys whose place he doesn’t threaten.</p>
      <p>He’s already backed away twice, for his own benefit, and fair play to him for having the self-awareness to know he needed it. No question, Celtic have benefitted.</p>
      <p>He came back for Gordon Strachan because he loved the wee man – and that’s fair enough. He turned up for the one squad Malky Mackay took, even though he didn’t play – he was asked to be an influence in the dugout and the dressing room and he was.</p>
      <p>But this column said then that the in-out-in-out hokey cokey had to stop, and nothing’s changed.</p>
      <p>If players who haven’t turned up suddenly wish they had because we’re in a finals, great.</p>
      <p>Scotland needs to become an environment where regret and envy are part of the mix.</p>
      <p>It’ll maybe make players think twice about taking the p***.</p>

      <p>And miracle or not, it’s still possible that could come in the summer. It wasn’t great against Cyprus and Kazakhstan last week – but it was certainly better.</p>
      <p>Defensively, Scotland were all over the shop at times but eventually got to where they needed to be by the second half on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>And up front is still a problem.</p>
      <p>If it wasn’t before, it should be 4K clear that neither of the Olis are good enough – and they’ve had enough auditions.</p>
      <p>So Clarke needs Stevie Naismith to stay injury free and Leigh Griffiths to be physically fit, mentally ready and also playing again – and who knows how likely any of those three things are to happen?</p>
      <p>And he also needs to hope that Steven Fletcher takes the same kind of tumble to himself that Scott Brown seems prepared to make.</p>
      <p>That’s not hypocrisy.</p>
      <p>At least Fletcher has contributed heavily to getting us to the point where we can qualify. If he turns out in March, he can say he earned us the right to be there.</p>
      <p>His return last season for the games against Albania and Israel was exactly what we needed, it showed how much we’d been missing a player like him.</p>

      <p>We scored seven goals in two games, he scored one and had a massive hand in the all-round <br/>excellence of Ryan Fraser, James Forrest and Ryan Christie.</p>
      <p>It’s as good as it’s been for us in the past few years. Yet for exactly the same reasons as Brown, he hasn’t turned up in a year since.</p>
      <p>He’s 32, troubled by niggles and needs to protect his body for his club as they chase promotion.</p>
      <p>But he’s played 43 games in the year since, played 15 out of 16 in the league for Sheffield Wednesday so far this season. He’s hardly porcelain.</p>
      <p>Yet here we are, two games away from possibly our first major finals in donkeys years. If there’s a single Scottish soul out there, Fletcher included, who thinks they can still take or leave these play-offs, then regret is all they deserve.</p>
      <p>Brilliant news for Partick Thistle last week. My club Falkirk tried to make the same move to fan ownership this year but didn’t have what Partick have – Colin Weir.</p>
      <p>Benevolent financial leadership.</p>
      <p>As Hearts and St Mirren have proven, you need an Ann Budge or a Gordon Scott. Someone to take the slack until the wider support have a framework for stewardship and are ready to pull their weight.</p>
      <p>Without it, you’re doomed. Look at Dundee.</p>
      <p>And the interim Thistle board looks excellent, a group of people who care deeply but are also professional and skilled enough to understand the concept that fan-owned should never mean fan-run.</p>
      <p>Good luck to them. Wish it was us.</p>
