      <h1>Jose Mourinho isn't a winner any more - Tottenham had better chance under Mauricio Pochettino</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham have sacked a manager who turned them into Champions League contenders, and brought in Mourinho who will never lead Spurs to the Premier League title</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Daniel Levy's decision to sack Mauricio Pochettino and hire Jose Mourinho is ­modern-day football lunacy.</p>
      <p>And the only way the decision will ever be justified is if Mourinho leads Tottenham to Premier League or Champions League glory.</p>
      <p>I’m going to stick my neck on the line here, though, by telling you that, despite his claims to the contrary, Mourinho will never – NEVER – win the top flight with Spurs.</p>
      <p>He may have got off to a winning start against a very poor West Ham team, but he won’t be able to get the right players and the right ­aggressive, tempo-laden set-up in place that is needed to win the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Spurs stood a much better chance with Pochettino in charge.</p>

      <p>And what embarrasses me about his departure is that the football fraternity seems to think a man who builds a castle should be vilified for not quite putting the flag on top, while someone who puts flags on crumpled castles is hailed as some kind of genius.</p>
      <p>Let’s get this right, though.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is only at Spurs because of his PR ability and because he was a good manager years ago.</p>
      <p>He has known that, by dangling his hook in the water by appearing on Sky Sports in recent weeks, ­eventually the chairman of a big club would swim up and swallow it.</p>
      <p>Levy has been snagged and what ­amazes me is that even the supposed best chairmen in the country can still be wowed by a bright, shiny new toy.</p>

      <p>The response to Mourinho’s ­appointment in some quarters has astonished me as well, with plenty of people arguing that Spurs now have a winner in the Portuguese.</p>
      <p>Not any more he isn’t.</p>
      <p>I know he might win Spurs a League Cup, FA Cup or even a Europa League, but that’s a very ­narrow definition of a winner, isn’t it?</p>
      <p>I’d say a winner is someone who leaves a club in a much better place than the one they found it and in a position to ­compete at the business end of elite competitions for the next five, 10 or 15 years. And when did Mourinho last do that?</p>
      <p>Take his first 10 buys at Manchester United – Eric Bailly, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Paul Pogba, Victor Lindelof, Romelu Lukaku, Nemanja Matic, Alexis Sanchez, Fred, Diogo Dalot and Lee Grant?</p>

      </figure>
      <p>How many of those players did he make better? None.</p>
      <p>Yet Pochettino improved just about every player he worked with at Spurs in his five-and-a-half years there and turned the club into serial Champions League competitors for the first time.</p>
      <h3>Slaughtered</h3>
      <p>The only glass ceiling Pochettino needs to break now is in winning that first trophy, but he will do that sooner rather than later and build great things wherever he goes next.</p>
      <p>If getting a club to their first ­Champions League final isn't a ­reflection of its good health, then I’m not sure what is.</p>

      <p>He is the antithesis of Mourinho and, as I have said several times this season, he should have been given the keys to the club in the summer and told to build a new team that would fight even harder for those elusive titles and trophies.</p>
      <p>But Levy has axed a man who ­promotes youth, develops talent, has a personal bond with his players and stays with them through thick and thin.</p>
      <p>That’s in comparison to ­someone who fell out with players at all of his clubs, who ­slaughtered Luke Shaw at United, despite the fact he was trying to overcome such a horrible injury, was increasingly­ ­spiteful and obstinate and hasn’t worked within a budget since 2003.</p>
      <p>Levy has swapped evolution for a revolution that might leave them with an FA Cup or League Cup in three years, but at a big cost.</p>
      <p>If you read this and you do not believe that what Poch brings to a club is better than what Mourinho brings, then I directly accuse you of knowing zero about football.</p>
