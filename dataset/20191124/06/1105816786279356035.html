      <h1>Liam Hemsworth's sister-in-law says he deserves more than Miley divorce</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:43:58+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>Star-studded former married couple Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are seeming to stay out of the spotlight as of late relating to their messy divorce in August. That is, until Liam’s sister-in-law Elsa Pataky shared her thoughts on the break-up.</p>
      <p>Elsa, who is married to <i>Thor</i> star and Liam’s borther Chis Hemsworth, gave everyone an update on <i>The Hunger Games</i> actor, who has been keeping a low-profile and dating fellow Australian Maddison Brown, reported <i><a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29890327/liam-chris-hemsworth-elsa-pataky-divorce-miley-cyrus-deserve-better/">Cosmopolitan </a>.</i></p>

      <p>At the Madrid launch of a lingerie line, Elsa started out by saying, “My brother-in-law, well, after a relationship where he dedicated 10 years, he’s discouraged…but he’s taking it well.” She didn’t elaborate on the discouraged part, but she did go on to say, “He’s a strong guy and he deserves the best. I think he deserves much more.”</p>
      <p>Elsa continued that Liam is getting through these tough times by really leaning on his brother Thor Chris. “Family is always there to protect you,” she shared. “He and his brother are so close, and he’s really been there for him to give him the strength he needs.”</p>

      <p>Miley, who has been pretty vocal on social media throughout their breakup, hasn’t responded to Elsa’s comments. And Liam probably won’t ever say anything based on the Instagram he posted shortly before he filed for divorce in August.</p>

      <p>At the time, he wrote, “Hi all, just a quick note to say that Miley and I have recently separated and I wish her nothing but health and happiness going forward. This is a private matter and I have not made, nor will I be making, any comments to any journalists or media outlets. Any reported quotes attributed to me are false. Peace and Love.”</p>
