      <h1>Flight embarrassment motivates Derbyshire woman to lose 10 stone</h1>
      <h2>She was determined to slim down</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:30</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Lyons</a></address>
      <p>An awkward incident on a plane prompted a determined Derbyshire woman to lose weight and <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/health">transform her health and her life</a>.</p>
      <p>Katrina Brown, from Heanor, was verging on 24st when she found the motivation to start losing weight in October, last year.</p>
      <p>With a dress size of 30, Katrina struggled to walk around and her weight caused her leg and back injuries.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, on a flight to Dublin, her size meant that other passengers had to move seats so that she could fly.</p>
      <p>Incredibly, just 13 months on, the 30-year-old has slimmed down to 13st 8lbs thanks to a big shift in her diet.</p>
      <p>As a result of her weight loss, Katrina's energy levels have increased, her confidence has been boosted and she now swims and goes for long walks.</p>
      <p>Katrina, a soft play manager <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/heanor">from Heanor</a>, said: "I was always big growing up and I just got bigger and bigger.</p>
      <p>"I wasn't fit enough to do any exercise, didn't do much cooking at all and had takeaways or went out for food most nights.</p>
      <p>"At my heaviest, I was struggling to even walk around because I kept hurting my leg and back.</p>
      <p>"I was off work for a while with the injuries too, so I decided it was time to do something about it.</p>
      <p>"One of my goals was to sit in a normal seat on a plane, without needing extra leg room.</p>

      <p>"I went to Dublin and ordered an extra leg room seat, but I couldn't even sit on it because I didn't have a seat belt extender.</p>
      <p>"That was really embarrassing because some of the people on the plane had to move for me.</p>
      <p>"I didn't want to have to go through that again."</p>
      <p>Katrina joined the Ilkeston Slimming World group in October, last year.</p>
      <p>Supported by five of her friends and family, she lost 6.5lbs in her first week and soon made big changes to her daily diet.</p>
      <p>Katrina said: "We go to Slimming World together. My mum, sister, sister-in-law, and two friends all go to the same group.</p>
      <p>"I've always done Slimming World in the past, but I never stayed to a group for long enough.</p>

      <h3>How Katrina's daily diet has changed</h3>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p><b>Breakfast:</b> No breakfast</p>

      <p>"But, I stuck to it this time. I cook food from scratch most of the time, planning my daily diet by writing it all down.</p>
      <p>"I used to drink a lot of Coca-Cola, but I've swapped it for Coke Zero and squash. I do still have hot chocolate quite often though.</p>
      <p>"For snacks, I used to have chocolate, cake or whatever I could get hold of.</p>
      <p>"But, now I have fruit, low-fat yogurts, and do portion control by weighing my food before I eat it."</p>
      <p>Now a size 14, Katrina is delighted that her weight loss has allowed her to get into swimming and enjoy walking again.</p>
      <p>She added: "The weight loss means I can now go swimming twice a week and dog walking most days. I would never have dreamed of going swimming before my weight loss.</p>
      <p>"I never do less than 12,000 steps a day, and some days I do 20,000 when we take the dogs out on longer walks.</p>
      <p>"I used to read weight loss stories in the paper and think 'how have they done that?', and I never thought it would be me who's lost the 10st.</p>
      <p>"The weight loss has given me loads more energy at work and my confidence has grown so much.</p>
