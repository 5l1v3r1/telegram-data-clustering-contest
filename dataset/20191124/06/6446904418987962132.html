      <p>THE MAJORITY OF people in the Republic of Ireland would like to see an Irish unity referendum in the next five years. </p>
      <p>That’s according to the latest Amárach/Claire Byrne Live poll for <i>TheJournal.ie </i>which found that 51% people would like to see the referendum take place in the next five years. </p>
      <p>The poll found that 29% of people would not like to see the referendum take place in the next five years, while 20% of people were unsure. </p>
      <p>If a border poll was to take place, the people of Northern Ireland would be asked whether they want to remain part of the United Kingdom or create a united Ireland.</p>
      <p>Depending on the result, the Republic would then vote on the matter.</p>
      <p>Under the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Secretary of State can initiate a border poll in circumstances where it is clear public opinion had swung towards Irish unity.</p>
      <p>Looking at a regional breakdown of the poll, Munster was the area with the most amount of people in favour of a referendum over the next five years, at 62%. </p>
      <p>In Leinster (excluding Dublin), 55% of people were in favour of the referendum, while 47% in Connaught/Ulster and 40% in Dublin were in favour. </p>
      <p>In the age range 18-24, a total of 70% of people wished to see the referendum take place, while just 9% were against the idea. </p>
      <p>The least amount of people were in favour of the referendum in the 45-54 and 55+ age range categories, both at 43%.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-united-ireland-4867156-Oct2019/">Speaking last month</a>, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he would like to see a united Ireland in his lifetime. </p>
      <p>When asked if he would like to see a united Ireland, he said: “I would, but only in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement, so that’s only with the consent of the majority of people in Northern Ireland.” </p>
      <p>He said “that’s really important stuff and nobody should be forced into anything they don’t want”. </p>
      <p>“And also, I think, if we ever get to that point, we need to make sure that unionists in Northern Ireland and British people in Northern Ireland feel that a united Ireland is a warm place for them,” Varadkar said. </p>
      <p>“We don’t want to have a repeat of what happened 100 years ago when a minority was left behind.”</p>
      <p>
        <i>The Claire Byrne Live / Amarách Research Panel consists of over 1,000 Irish adults, all aged 18+. The poll was conducted earlier this week.</i>
