      <p>Alec and Hilaria Baldwin are planning to try for another baby after their recent miscarriage heartbreak.<br/><br/>The yoga instructor had been four months along in her latest pregnancy when she learned they had lost their fifth child, a baby girl, earlier this month. It was Hilaria's second miscarriage, as she also lost a baby back in April, but she and Alec are still hoping to give their four children another sibling - in time.<br/><br/>"We're going to have another one, just not now. It's a question of time... It was a surprise," Alec said as he and Hilaria spoke to reporters at the American Museum of Natural History's 2019 Museum Gala on Thursday night.<br/><br/>"We can't end on that note. I don't want to," Hilaria added to Entertainment Tonight. "At least, we're trying not to end on that note. Cause that was a sad note."<br/><br/>"Yeah, we're gonna have another one," Alec smiled. "We're gonna have another one."<br/><br/>As for how she's coping, Hilaria told Extra: "Physically, I am feeling a lot better. Emotionally, I'm feeling a lot better. Sharing can be hard, but once you share, it feels a little more real and then once it's more real, you can heal" It also made me feel not alone."<br/><br/>James Van Der Beek's wife Kimberly also recently suffered a miscarriage, and Hilaria added that she had been in touch with her following their sad news.<br/><br/>"We connected, and I guess we truly know what's going on for each other," she said. "It's been tough. She's very strong and my heart is with what's going on with them."</p>
