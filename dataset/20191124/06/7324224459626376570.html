      <p>
        <b>LIAM ROBERTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>A clean sheet and another solid performance from Roberts. He wasn't troubled with any real opportunities as the defenders blocked most of the Stevenage shots. However, his distribution was poor at times and he did drop one corner, which fortunately didn't end in a goal. <b>6</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>SHAY FACEY</b>
      </p>
      <p>Facey has made the right-back slot his own since returning from injury and he looks to be keeping it. Defensively he was strong and due to the front three of Stevenage he was often having to defend, rather than attack. This meant he was limited going forward. <b>6</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>JAMES CLARKE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Probably Walsall's best defender of the game, Clarke is consistently putting in good performances. Strong, good on the ball and effective in the air, he did well. He also tends to make players around him better and Dan Scarr certainly benefited from it. <b>7</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>DAN SCARR</b>
      </p>
      <p>In recent weeks, before his suspension, Scarr has struggled and made several individual mistakes. Alongside Clarke for this game he was much more composed and often won his aerial duels. His goal-line clearance saved Walsall from conceding another late goal too. <b>6</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>CALLUM COCKERILL-MOLLETT</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 20-year-old is putting together consistent performances in a row and this was no different. Defensively strong as always, he also offered a threat going forward in the second half. As with Facey, in the first 45 he was pegged back. <b>7</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>RORY HOLDEN</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not his best performance, but also not his worst. First half, alongside the rest of his team-mates, Holden struggled to get on the ball. In the second half he was much better and got himself into good positions. An excellent save stopped him getting his first Saddlers goal. <b>6</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>ALFIE BATES</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the first half, Bates really struggled. He couldn't get on the ball and when he did he was misplacing too many passes. The introduction of Guthrie was instrumental and Bates hugely improved. Despite this, he consistently put in the effort throughout the whole 90 minutes. <b>6</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>LIAM KINSELLA</b>
      </p>
      <p>It wasn't the best day for Kinsella, who only lasted 45 minutes. He wasn't alone in a difficult first half for Walsall, but he was rightly replaced. Less because of his own game, but more because of the effective introduction of Guthrie who was excellent. <b>5</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>WES MCDONALD</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alongside Kinsella, McDonald was hauled off after 45 minutes. Usually he's electric and causing all sorts of problems on the wing. But against Stevenage he was isolated. When he did get on the ball, he wasn't quite at it and often gave the ball away. <b>5</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>JOSH GORDON</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gordon hasn't scored in two games now, but his performances are still relatively consistent. He works extremely hard and was creating chances from sheer perseverance. Gordon and Lavery are still the way to go up front and the goals will keep flowing with him.<b> 6</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>CAOLAN LAVERY</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lavery is technically very good and also works very hard alongside Gordon. His experience and nous is what is most impressive and he could have easily set up a goal in this game. Perhaps both Lavery and Gordon need to come more centrally and occupy the box. 6</p>
      <p>
        <b>DANNY GUTHRIE (for Kinsella 45)</b>
      </p>
      <p>After a poor second half, Guthrie’s introduction was the right move from Darrell Clarke. He’s the most talented and experienced player in the squad and after only 45 minutes was surely the man of the match. He could have won it at the end and his performance would have warranted it. <b>7</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>JAMES HARDY (for McDonald 45)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Many fans have called for Hardy to get a chance but it didn’t quite click for him. Out wide he certainly struggled and couldn’t affect the game. When he moved more centrally he looked more comfortable but was slightly off the pace still. <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>SUBS:</b> Adebayo (for Holden 75) <b>6</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Subs not used:</b> Rose, Norman, Sadler, Gaffney.</p>
