      <p>The NBA is investigating an incident between Boston guard Marcus Smart and a fan in Denver, after the Celtics guard said he heard a derogatory comment and was unhappy with the way that he believed security in the arena responded to the matter.</p>
      <p>Smart said a fan told him to "get on your knees" after he pursued a loose ball along the sideline during Friday's game in Denver. Smart said one of his feet got tangled in frame of a courtside chair, and while he was trying to free himself he heard the comment.</p>
      <p>NBA spokesman Tim Frank said Saturday the league is investigating the matter.</p>
      <p>“The fan told me, ‘That’s right, stay on the ground, get on your knees,’” Smart told reporters postgame Friday night. “Excuse me? I just told him, 'Listen, just watch the game because if we retaliate to you guys and if we were on the street, I guarantee you wouldn't say that.”</p>
      <p>Smart said security at Denver's Pepsi Center essentially ignored him. At least one security guard was seen speaking to fans in that section moments after the fourth-quarter incident, but it was unclear if any further action was taken.</p>
      <p>The incident is just the latest in several derogatory exchanges that have caught the NBA's attention in recent months. Russell Westbrook, DeMarcus Cousins, Kyle Lowry and others were involved in such incidents last season, prompting the NBA to say that it wants arena security personnel to have zero tolerance for abusive or hateful behavior.</p>
      <p>"That's a problem in the league that we've got to fix," Smart said. "If we retaliate to protect ourselves, we're the ones getting in trouble. They're not. And that's not right. ... There's nowhere in this league for it."</p>
