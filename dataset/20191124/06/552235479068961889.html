      <h1>The advice Neil Lennon gave to Celtic No.2 John Kennedy after he was approached by Hibs</h1>
      <h2>The Hoops assistant rejected a move by Hibs to lure him as Paul Heckingbottom’s replacement.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Waddell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>Neil Lennon insists that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-kennedy">John Kennedy</a> is ready to be a boss now – at any club, including Celtic.</p>
      <p>The Hoops boss was thrilled his No.2 rejected a move by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> to lure him as Paul Heckingbottom’s replacement.</p>
      <p>And speaking for the first time about the 36-year-old’s decision to stay put at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a>, Lennon claims it’s only a matter of time before Kennedy’s his own man.</p>
      <p>He said: “John could do it right now. He is ready to go into management or the head-coach role.</p>
      <p>“He has been doing it now for four five years.</p>
      <p>“People say that you never know when you are ready and that would be the case, but I think he is ready.</p>
      <p>“Some people say they are not ready but if an opportunity comes along and it is the right one then I think he would make a fine job of it wherever he went really.”</p>

      <p>The Hibs approach may be the first for Kennedy - but Lennon knows that it won’t be the last.</p>
      <p>The Northern Irishman said: “He’s been first-team coach under a few managers at Celtic, but this time he is number two – or number one-and-a-half, as I call him because he is that close to me.</p>
      <p>“That has maybe really captured people’s attention.</p>
      <p>“He is still young enough not to take the plunge just yet but if you ask me if he is ready to go into management, I would say yeah.</p>
      <p>“He did ask me about taking the Hibs job – I gave him short shrift! I said ‘Look, I’m not surprised but you’re just too important to what we are doing here. You know your time will come’.</p>
      <p>“He is ambitious, but the club means a lot to him.</p>
      <p>“He’s made a huge contribution to the club and he still has a big contribution to make before he either steps in here, in the hot seat eventually, or he goes and does his own thing.</p>
      <p>“I’m not surprised he’s sought after, though, because he is excellent. He’s worked under Ronny Deila and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> for the past five years so he has a wealth of coaching expertise now.</p>
      <p>“You can see the way he works with the players that he has a great relationship with them and he was really important to me coming in.</p>
      <p>“I needed that stability and am so glad he has decided to stay."</p>
