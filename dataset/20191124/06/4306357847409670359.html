      <h3>Frank Lampard has revealed that he has already exchanged messages with new Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho.</h3>
      <p>The Portuguese head coach secured a return to Premier League management last week after Mourinho was appointed as Mauricio Pochettino’s replacement.</p>
      <p>Mourinho took over the reins of the north London side nearly 11 months after Manchester United sacked the two-time Champions League winner.</p>
      <p>His appointment at Spurs is controversial given Mourinho’s association with their bitter London rivals Chelsea FC.</p>
      <p>Lampard won two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the League Cup under Mourinho’s management.</p>
      <p>The retired England international is currently in charge of Chelsea FC following his appointment in the summer.</p>
      <p>Speaking at his pre-match media conference ahead of Chelsea FC’s trip to Manchester City on Saturday evening, Lampard backed Mourinho’s record as a manager.</p>
      <p>“We had a couple of messages,” Lampard said. “I think history and results speak for themselves. He has done that consistently. It’s what we measure him and us as managers.</p>
      <p>“He has got a good team. They were a lot of people’s favourites to be in the race. Pochettino did a great job.</p>
      <p>“They have the structure there and will be a threat. They are in the top four race.</p>
      <p>“When you look at the quality. The strength that they have, Kane and players like that.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC started the weekend in fourth place and 12 points ahead of Mourinho’s Tottenham side in the race to secure a top-four finish in the Premier League this season.</p>
      <p>The Blues turned to Lampard in the summer after Maurizio Sarri stood down as Chelsea FC manager to take charge of Serie A champions Juventus after just 12 months in charge.</p>
      <p>Lampard’s previous managerial experience was limited to 12 months in charge of Derby County.</p>
