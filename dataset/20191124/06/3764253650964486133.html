      <p>Deontay Wilder produced a stunning knockout on Sunday morning, November 24, at MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas to beat Luis Ortiz just when many thought he was going to lose his WBC heavyweight belt</p>
      <p>Right up till the seventh round, the 'Bronze Bomber' was being outclassed by his 40-year-old opponent Ortiz and even failed to land any significant blow in the first six rounds of the bout as Ortiz looked to be coasting to victory.</p>
      <p>However, Wilder showed he is still the king of 1-punch knockout as his vicious right blow caught Ortiz in the seventh round that ended the contest.</p>

      <p>Ortiz was laid flat on the canvas and failed to make the 10 count as Wilder went on to retain his WBC belt in the most spectacular fashion.</p>
