      <p>Princess Beatrice helped her Prince Andrew set up his car-crash Newsnight interview - and has been crying since, it is reported.</p>
      <p>His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, was also among the key figures who pushed for Prince Andrew to go ahead with the televised interview.</p>
      <p>Fergie believed the public would be convinced the Duke was telling the truth if he talked about the Jeffrey Epstein scandal in his own words, according to reports.</p>
      <p>It's said the Duchess had also been keen to end the speculation about the Duke's involvement with convicted paedophile ahead of Beatrice's wedding next year.</p>

      <p>But the interview has led to Prince Andrew stepping down from his royal duties and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/queen-cancels-prince-andrews-60th-20948024">has his birthday party downgraded to a much smaller family dinner</a> by the Queen.</p>
      <p>Beatrice, 31, and her father met Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis three days before the formal interview, it's reported in the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7718663/Princess-Beatrice-helped-set-father-Prince-Andrews-car-crash-BBC-interview.html">Mail on Sunday</a>.</p>
      <p>A source said: "Sarah [Ferguson] was abroad so Beatrice sat in on the discussions. Initially, Beatrice was sceptical that a television interview, which would inevitably delve into her father's private life, was such a good idea.</p>
      <p>"She was asking lots of pertinent questions and had her doubts.</p>
      <p>"But by the end of the meeting she was convinced by the Newsnight team and Amanda Thirsk [Duke's then-private secretary] that they had no choice - that it was the only way to put all the rumours behind them."</p>

      <p>Princess Beatrice is now mortified that she did not do more to stop the interview going ahead, the source said.</p>
      <p>The insider added: "Both Sarah and Andrew rely on Beatrice's judgement a lot when it comes to dealing with the public as she's got an old head on young shoulders.</p>
      <p>"You can't really blame Beatrice because I think the odds were stacked against her on this one.</p>
      <p>"Andrew, Fergie and Amanda decided they had to do it."</p>

      <p>But Beatrice was seen 'tearful' while hosting a party for her fiance's 36th birthday on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The source said: "Beatrice was sombre and make-up-free for the birthday dinner.</p>
      <p>"She seemed quite tearful at times. In fact, Beatrice has been in tears every day since the interview went out."</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew has since announced to 'step back from public duties for the foreseeable future'.</p>
