      <p>I’ve done a bit of online dating, so I was pretty comfortable meeting someone I’ve never met before. I have been hoping to meet a partner after being divorced for nearly a year. I have to say I don’t really have any deal breakers but in the past my height has become an issue for some.</p>
      <p>I have found with online dating around 30 or 40 per cent of girls mention their height first, or once I mention that I’m 177cm they say that doesn’t work for them because they don’t want anyone shorter than them which can be brutal. One girl did say to me that she wanted to feel feminine and she couldn’t feel that way with me with someone shorter than her.</p>
      <p>Meeting Frizz out the front of The Flour Factory was pretty easy, it was a Tuesday night so not that busy on King Street. When I first saw her she was very pretty and had a lovely smile. Once we got inside and started chatting she was really to talk to straight away she said she was a little bit nervous but didn’t seem that way at all.</p>
      <p>We went to the bar, and they had a table reserved for us, and we sat and chatted for about 10 minutes before we even ordered a drink.</p>
      <blockquote>We sat and chatted for about 10 minutes before we even ordered a drink.</blockquote>
      <p>I found out she’s very heavily into sport with what she does so we had a lot in common it turns out with her job as a radio producer has a lot to do with sport and supports the team that I coach (West Perth Football Club) so had a lot to talk to about that.</p>
      <p>As Christmas is coming up we talked about what we do around that time with our families and I happened to say I liked Star Wars which she did too, which is quite the odd combination for a girl to have a liking to, to enjoy sport and Star Wars I don’t think I’ve ever met a girl or seen that before.</p>
      <p>We got a couple of drinks each and a bite to eat, there wasn’t any gaps in the conversation where you’re trying to think of something to say. It all flowed pretty well but there just wasn’t a romantic connection.</p>
      <p>I’ve been on dates in the past where I’ve felt I wouldn’t mind that couple of hours back but I didn’t feel that way though I don’t really see it progressing much as a friendship. She was really nice and someone I’d spend time with but in terms of a relationship nothing I could forsee yet but you never know.</p>
      <p><b>VERDICT</b>: 7.5 to an 8/10</p>

      <p>I was totally nervous because I am kind of new to dating, even though I am the age that I am so it was really confronting. So the whole getting ready for the date, I’ve never really done that before.</p>
      <p>I wanted to be the most comfortable I can because I knew everything else I was going to be out of my comfort zone so I wore jeans and a t-shirt, comfy heels and just something that was really me and I felt good in.</p>
      <p>On meeting Todd he was not someone I would normally go for, I’d normally go for guys a lot taller so he took me by surprise a bit, but he seemed like a nice gentleman which is pretty rare these days.</p>
      <p>I then found out that he actually is a coach at the footy club that I’m involved with (West Perth) so know all his players, it was just so typically Perth.</p>

      <p>We sat down at the bar and showed us to a table, it was a really nice place to have a conversation. We ordered a couple of cocktails and just some little share food and stuff like that, and that was a bit awkward to be honest because I’ve got dietary requirements.</p>
      <p>We just made a few jokes about how I’m allergic to sesame seeds. I have an epi-pen for it so we had a joke about what he had to do if he suddenly had to use it.</p>
      <p>I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to anyone that works at a bank, that sounds really weird, completely opposite to what I do.</p>
      <p>I’m a breakfast radio producer at 6PR and also a football producer so we spoke about our jobs and a lot about sport and footy. We spoke a bit about family, a big part of my life and seems to be with his life aswell. We had a good chat about the important people in our lives, it was really nice.</p>
      <p>I don’t think there was any chemistry throughout the night, I feel like it was kind of a friend zone thing on both our parts, we exchanged numbers but I don’t know if anything will come of it. We got along really well but I don’t think that spark was there. But you never know.</p>
      <p><b>VERDICT</b>: 8/10</p>
      <p>
