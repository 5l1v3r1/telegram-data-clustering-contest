      <h1>Haniyeh: Netanyahu indictment 'raises our morale'</h1>
      <h2>Hamas leader claims Netanyahu indictment a sign “of more steadfastness” for Palestinians.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:41:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:41</time> by <a rel="author">Arutz Sheva Staff</a></address>
      <p>Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on Saturday weighed in <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/272066">on the indictment</a> of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, claiming it “raises the morale” of Palestinian Arabs.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters in Rafah in southern Gaza and quoted by <i>The Associated Press</i>, Haniyeh claimed that the corruption charges against Netanyahu were a sign “of more steadfastness” for the Palestinians.</p>
      <p>The leader of the terrorist group that controls Gaza also said the indictment means more “resistance, both popular and armed.”</p>
      <p>Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian legislative polls, which were the last ones to have been held. Recently, however, Palestinian Authority (PA) chairman Mahmoud Abbas <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/269453">renewed a pledge</a> to hold fresh parliamentary elections.</p>
      <p>Abbas' term as PA chairman <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/168590">was meant to expire in 2009</a>, but he has remained in office in the absence of elections.</p>
      <p>In order to hold a general election, Abbas needs the agreement of Hamas to resume control of Gaza. Hamas is opposed to holding general elections that are not part of a comprehensive reform of PA institutions, including the Palestinian National Council, and it also demands that a new leadership be established in which Hamas and Islamic Jihad representatives will be integrated.</p>
      <p>Abbas recently sent a memo on elections to Gaza-based factions, requesting their signatures to declare their commitment to the 2007 elections law and to holding the elections in eastern Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>However, Gaza's political factions, especially Hamas which insists on holding dialogue before elections, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271186">rejected Abbas’ request</a>.</p>
