      <p>BayleyBayley's new look</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE </a>SmackDown Women's Champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/bayley">Bayley </a>was recently spotted sporting a new look during the Survivor Series Meet and Greet session. Bayley's appearance seems to be inspired by her best friend <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/sasha-banks">Sasha Banks</a>.</p>
      <p>A short while ago, Bayley shocked the WWE Universe by attacking WWE RAW Women's Champion Becky Lynch. Soon after, Bayley debuted a completely new look right before a match where she was scheduled to compete against <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/charlotte-flair">Charlotte Flair</a> for the blue brand's Women's Title. Bayley's new look consisted of short black hair and a new outfit. To add to it, she destroyed the Bayley Buddies while making her entrance for the match, completing the heel turn.</p>
