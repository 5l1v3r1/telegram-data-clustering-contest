      <h1>We Totally Dig This Rendering Of A 1965 Ford Mustang Wagon</h1>
      <h2>Would you have bought one?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:26:40+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/jacob-oliva/" target="_blank">Jacob Oliva</a></address>
      <p>I think we can all agree that the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/mach-e/">Ford Mustang Mach-E</a> is a controversial car. A name that has been known as a fossil fuel-burning, low-riding, two-door coupe was given a brother with the same name. But this time, it's a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/mustang/">Mustang</a> that's practical and electric – words that are hardly best to describe the pony car.</p>
      <p>But what if Ford did the same thing with the 1965 Mustang? Would it have received the same flak as the Mustang Mach-E?</p>
      <p>That's the exact train of thought by the folks over at <i>Abimelec Design</i>. Posted over at their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/606198686193087/posts/1934323846713891/">Facebook page</a>, the design gurus made a realistic rendering of a Mustang wagon dubbed as the Mustang Mach-4.</p>

      <p><i>Abimelec Design</i>'s Mustang Mach-4 isn't electric, though. But they have employed a little parallelism between their rendering and the Mustang Mach-E, taking what makes the electric Mustang sacrilegious and translated them into what could have been their equivalent in 1965.</p>
      <p>Instead of being electric, the Mach-4 runs on a Lotus-tuned four-cylinder engine with dual camshafts. To give it an SUV vibe, the supposed Mach-4 was rendered as a wagon (or a shooting brake) and was given a four-wheel-drive system. Again, two things that you'll never find in a Mustang – except for a Mustang station wagon concept that never hit production.</p>

      <p>With this rendering, we got to thinking – if Ford pushed for production of a Mustang wagon, would we be more accepting of the full-electric Mustang Mach-E? Wouldn't that change our perception that the pony car should remain as a coupe for its entire lifetime?</p>
      <p>And more importantly, would you have bought one if Ford had made this a reality? Let us know in the comments section below.</p>
