      <p>Comedian Dave Hughes was among the disappointed crowd and told his Instagram followers he was left with two disappointed fans.</p>
      <p>"We survived an actual fire at premiere of Frozen 2," he said.</p>
      <p>"Rivoli Cinema in Camberwell evacuated in an orderly fashion. Firetrucks on the scene now. Smelt smoke but didnâ€™t see flames.</p>
      <p>"Girls say it was at vital moment of movie. They are eating popcorn in the car now."</p>
