      <h1>“Anti-goal merchants”: Gary Lineker slates VAR after Palace opener ruled out against Liverpool</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:59:19+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>BT Sports and BBC pundit Gary Lineker has taken a swipe at VAR after the technology was utilised to rule out a Crystal Palace goal over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The Eagles thought they had drawn first blood against Liverpool, but it was ruled out after the officials discovered Dejan Lovren had been fouled in the area.</p>
      <p>Former Leicester City man Lineker was quick to jump on social media to call out the technology, and label the users of it “<a href="https://twitter.com/garylineker/status/1198266909545906177?s=12"><b>anti-goal merchants</b></a>“.</p>
      <blockquote>Took a while, but VAR rules out a Palace goal against Liverpool. If you look for long enough the anti-goal merchants will find something. 🙄<br/>— Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/1198266909545906177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>There hasn’t been a week that has gone by in which something controversial hasn’t happened, relating to VAR, and the Reds seem to be getting a bit of grief for it.</p>
      <p>Putting aside the fact Roberto Firmino’s armpit was offside a few weeks ago, the ruling out of Palace’s goal in our 2-1 win may be the first time we’ve benefited from VAR this season as in the way of points.</p>
      <p>The win against the Londonders means we remain eight points clear of Leicester, and now sit nine ahead of Man City and have 11 on Chelsea.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Opinion</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s disappointing to see Gary take this route, to be honest – he’s usually a bit more level-headed than this. When looking back at the footage, you can clearly see Lovren being pushed. It is a foul.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t matter if the players involved affected the play – the Liverpool man was fouled.</p>
