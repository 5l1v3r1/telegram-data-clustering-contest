      <h2>West Bromwich Albion are top of the Championship with Leeds United in second place</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Dicken, https://www.facebook.com/alexdickenjournalist/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United star Adam Forshaw has paid West Bromwich Albion the ultimate compliment.</p>
      <p>The Baggies extended their lead at the top of the Championship table with a 2-1 win over Sheffield Wednesday at The Hawthorns, sealed by Charlie Austin’s late penalty.</p>
      <p>Slaven Bilic’s team are two points ahead of second-placed Leeds and five in front of Preston in third.</p>

      <p>And Leeds midfielder Forshaw, who hasn’t played since September due to a hip problem, reckons Bilic’s Baggies will take some beating.</p>
      <p>“For me personally I think anyone who finishes above West Brom will get promoted,” Forshaw said during a punditry appearance on QUEST.</p>
      <p>Albion’s latest win was their third in succession and came without key duo Romaine Sawyers and Jake Livermore, both of whom missed out due to suspension.</p>

      <p>They were heading for a share of the spoils against Wednesday before Matheus Pereira was clattered by Owls’ goalkeeper Keiren Westwood to give the Baggies the chance to seal all three points.</p>
      <p>Austin duly delivered from 12 yards and Forshaw insists Wednesday can have no complaints about the decision to award the spot-kick.</p>
      <p>He said: “Pereira is a top player and he’s just nicked in front. Unfortunately for the goalkeeper, he’s made the referee’s mind up. He’s come out and with the momentum I’d say it’s a penalty.”</p>
