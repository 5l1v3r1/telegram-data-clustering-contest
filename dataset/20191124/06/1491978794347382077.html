        <i>The actor on being at home in Palm Springs… or away at fan conventions</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>What’s a regular Sunday morning?</b> I’m up at 8 or 9am; my husband Scott will still be sleeping. I open the sliding doors to the garden and have a coffee with the dogs. After an hour I’ll wake Scott up. Sometimes I like to put my face in the space between his shoulders and his neck, and breathe in its familiar smell.</p>
      <p><b>Fresh air? </b>We’ve got a 10,000ft mountain at the back of the garden here in Palm Springs, so if we go for a stroll it’s not for nature. We prefer to walk the streets to look at property and go to open houses. I love poking around other people’s homes.</p>
      <p><b>Your signature dish? </b>Sundays are for bacon, always greasy, so brunch is either at <a href="http://www.johnsrestaurantpalmsprings.com/">John’s Restaurant</a> when we’re here, or at a branch of <a href="https://www.dennys.com/">Denny’s</a>. Scott always has a coupon.</p>
      <p><b>Do you work? </b>Two weekends a month I’m away at a fan convention: France, Asia, Italy, Scotland. Last week it was Rhode Island. I’d definitely like to be at home more, but I’m not complaining. Meeting the people who’ve given me success is a pleasure.</p>
      <p><b>Do you shop?</b> One Sunday I arrived home in a car I was test driving to see if Scott liked it. He said it was an old man’s car. I took it back and turned up in another. ‘It’s sporty and fun,’ he said, ‘now take it back.’ It was too late, I’d already bought it.</p>
      <p><b>How were Sundays spent growing up?</b> At Gran Barrowman’s council flat in Glasgow with sandwiches and matchbox cards on her swirly carpet. She’d make a Victoria sponge every week without fail. I’m still trying to hunt down the family recipe.</p>
      <p><b>Do you have an evening routine?</b> A cocktail or two at 5pm in the pool - that’s my daily exercise. Then we watch a movie. I’m at an age where I prefer to be sprawled out on the sofa with my husband scratching my feet than anywhere else.</p>
