      <h3>Pakistan</h3>
      <p><b>Shaan Masood</b> Showed fight and good technique in both innings for Pakistan. One of their few decent performers with the bat. Made a patient 27 to blunt the new ball first time around then added 42 in the second innings when out hooking against Cummins <b>6.5</b></p>
      <p><b>Azhar Ali</b> Formed part of a stoic opening stand with a first-innings 39 that defied the Australians until lunch on day one. Needed to repeat the dose to give them any hope of a draw in the second innings but was trapped in front by Starc for five <b>6</b></p>

      <p><b>Haris Sohail</b> The Pakistan No.3 never looked likely with the bat, recording scores of one and eight, edging to Tim Paine off Mitchell Starc on both occasions. Took 2-75 with his tweakers but he's there primarily to make runs <b>4</b></p>
      <p><b>Asad Shafiq</b> Produced a fighting 76 in the first innings to help Pakistan avoid complete disaster and ended up as only one of two tourists to make it past 50. Undid some of that with a duck in the second dig when his side desperately needed him to hang around <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Babar Azam</b> The richly talented Babar threw his wicket away in the first innings for one with a swipe outside off-stump that was neither necessary nor successful. Bounced back in the second innings with a superb century to give himself and his side a timely confidence boost <b>8</b></p>
      <p><b>Iftikhar Ahmed</b> Made his way to seven in the first innings before going for a duck in the second innings. Throw in 0-53 with the ball and you have yourself a forgettable few days in the Queensland sun, of which he saw plenty standing around in the field <b>3</b></p>
      <p><b>Mohammad Rizwan</b> The little keeper tried hard to give his side a lift with his energy behind the stumps and some spirited batting in the middle order. Finished with a spritely 36 in the first innings and followed it up with a determined 95 in the second. A lot to like <b>8.5</b></p>
      <p><b>Yasir Shah</b> Bowled a mountain of overs and conceded plenty but managed to end up with 4-205, with one of those wickets being that of Steve Smith, who has become a bunny of sorts for the legspinner. Also claimed both Australian openers but not before they'd scored 10,000 runs <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Shaheen Afridi</b> The left-armer was the most economical of the Pakistan bowlers but they dearly needed wickets, not maidens. Like the rest of the seam attack, never found the right length on a bouncy Gabba track for long enough to create sustained pressure <b>5.5</b></p>
      <p><b>Naseem Shah</b> He's quick, that much we know. Had some of the Australians dancing about and would have had Warner gone if not for a no-ball. Was used sparingly due to age and inexperience but looks the goods <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Imran Khan</b> A controversial inclusion over Mohammad Abbas, Imran didn't produce a great body of work to show selectors made the right call. Took 1-73 but rarely looked as if he was causing much trouble, only getting the late wicket of Pat Cummins <b>5</b></p>
      <h3>Australia</h3>
      <p><b>David Warner</b> The dashing opener returned with a boom to Test cricket, loving the fast and bouncy conditions and belting 154 as part of a 222-run stand with Joe Burns. Put the Australians in charge early and never looked back <b>9</b></p>
      <p><b>Joe Burns</b> Earned a deserved recall and now looks set for the summer after making his way towards a century, only to fall for 97. Enjoys batting with Warner and looked as solid as Uluru out there <b>8</b></p>

        <figcaption>Marnus Labuschagne made a fine 185 on Saturday at the Gabba.<cite>Getty</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Marnus Labuschagne</b> The accidental hero no longer, Labuschagne delivered his first Test century in emphatic style. He ended with 185 and has added some quality and class to the top order. Could score a stack this summer <b>9.5</b></p>
      <p><b>Steve Smith</b> It felt like we had stepped into an alternate universe, one where Steve Smith gets yorked by a leg-spinner for just four, when his stumps were rattled by Yasir Shah. Didn't get another go either and was Australia's lowest scorer. Weird <b>4</b></p>
      <p><b>Matthew Wade</b> Continued the plunder when he batted, adding 60 as Australia ploughed their way to a match-winning total. Would have loved to go on with it but nicked one off Sohail <b>7.5</b></p>
      <p><b>Travis Head</b> Was probably trying to up the run rate by the time he came to the crease with a hefty Australian total already in the bank. Went for 24 in a match with limited opportunities for him <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>Tim Paine</b> Made 13 before mis-timing an ungainly pull shot but kept very sharply, rotated his bowlers well in the heat and pulled the right string on a few DRS decisions as well. Very solid outing from the skipper <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Pat Cummins</b> Took 3-60 in the first innings and along with Josh Hazlewood, upped the ante after Pakistan's early resistance. Just oozes class when he bowls and always looked dangerous on one of his favourite surfaces <b>7.5</b></p>
      <p><b>Mitchell Starc</b> Was Australia's top wicket taker with 4-52 in the first innings and broke the Pakistan top order apart with the new ball as he sent Sohail and Azhar back cheaply. First innings yorker to demolish Yair's stumps was unplayable <b>8</b></p>

      <p><b>Nathan Lyon</b> Toiled away on a track that had bounce but not a great deal of sideways assistance for the off-spinner. Got the big wicket of Babar in Pakistan's second innings to ensure the result would come in four days <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Josh Hazlewood</b> He bowled better than his first innings figures of 2-46 but remains Australia's premier line and length man. Found his range from the second session onwards and did the damage in the second innings as well, taking four wickets <b>8</b></p>
