      <h1>Government plans fintech push to boost export sector</h1>

      <p>Senator Jane Hume has signalled the potential for new global agreements to propel Australian fintechs into new markets, acknowledging Australia's current agreement with the UK to encourage exports of Australian tech isn't being used to its full potential.</p>
      <p>"The 'fintech bridge' is probably under-utilised, particularly at the moment in the Australia-to-the-UK side of things," the Assistant Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and Financial Technology told a Visa fintech panel in Melbourne on Friday.</p>

      <p>The fintech bridge agreement was unveiled in 2018 as a way to better facilitate trade and collaboration for banking disruptors across the two nations.</p>
      <p>Senator Hume said the UK agreement was an exciting project but had only taken its "first steps" towards fostering cross-border trade so far.</p>
      <p>In October the UK's department of international trade brought a cohort of UK companies to Melbourne for the Intersekt fintech festival.</p>
      <p>A number of UK competitors, including software business <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52zpe.html">TrueLayer</a> and small <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p537vb.html">business bank OakNorth,</a> signalled they will enter Australia ahead of the rollout of the open banking regime.</p>

      <p>The British fintech market is more mature than Australia's, with the region already operating under an open banking scheme where customers can share their data between banks to get better deals.</p>
      <p>There are 526 fintechs in Australia as of 2019, according to a Visa Future of Fintech report released on Friday â€“ an increase of 37 per cent on a year ago.</p>
      <p>Half of these companies want to expand overseas in the next 12 months, according to the 2019 EY Fintech census, with the UK and the US the most popular markets.</p>
      <p>Senator Hume said while it was early days, the government was determined to broker similar policies with other nations, including through a potential agreement with Singapore to help Australian companies expand into that region.</p>
      <p>"Certainly, when I was in Singapore they were very keen to establish something similar. We have started conversations already," she said.</p>
      <p>The hope is that a fintech bridge could be added as part of an Australia-Singapore digital economy agreement which is under discussion.</p>
      <p>There was also the option of a future trilateral fintech agreement between Australia, Singapore and the UK, she said.</p>
      <p>"That is a really exciting opportunity, particularly when we start talking about things like data and access, where we are so far ahead of the curve."</p>
      <p>Chief commercial officer at co-working space and startup support hub YBF Ventures, Niels Maartens, told the panel the local fintech market was maturing.</p>
      <p>"The hype is lowering and the amount of revenue growth is up and I like that aspect of it," he said.</p>
      <p>However, many local players may not be generating enough revenue to consider global expansion at this stage.</p>
      <p>Visa's report suggests only one in 10 local players have revenue of $1 million or more, while one third are post-revenue but make less than $100,000 a year.</p>
      <p>A Senate inquiry into the <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52qit.html">financial technology and regulatory technology</a> sectors is currently underway, with early submissions pointing to the importance of stable policies and access to talent.</p>
