      <h1>Ryan Reynolds Awkwardly Crashes ‘SNL’s Weekend Update With Scarlett Johansson’s Fiancee Colin Jost</h1>

      <h4>Colin Jost is currently engaged to Scarlett Johansson, who Ryan Reynolds was married to from 2008 – 2011 — talk about awkward!</h4>
      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/ryan-reynolds/"><b>Ryan Reynolds</b></a>, 43, popped up on <i>Saturday Night Live </i>several times on Nov. 22 and we definitely weren’t expecting <i>this</i> interaction! The <i>Deadpool</i> actor showed up in the sketch series’ popular Weekend Update skit, which is hosted by none other than <b>Colin Jost</b>, 37. Ryan rolled into the skit — literally, on a chair with wheels — looking straight out of a country club in a striped shirt and orange vest. Introduced as “Guy Who Knows The Owner” (because we all know one of those) Ryan had some interesting and — um — and very sexual innuendo. “It’s tight to be here, CoJo — I was in the areola,” he hilariously announced as Colin tried to keep a straight face. “This Thanksgiving, if you want to move out the friend zone and into her end zone, pay her a compliment — like ‘nice cooking’,” Ryan continued. “Remember — class leads to a–!” For some reason, we can picture him saying that to wife <b>Blake Lively</b>, 32.</p>
      <p>Colin, of course, is <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/05/19/scarlett-johansson-colin-jost-engaged/">engaged to <b>Scarlett Johansson</b></a>, 35, and the duo met when Scarlett hosted <i>SNL</i> in March 2017. The <i>Avengers</i> actress was previously married to Ryan, tying the knot back in 2008 but eventually filing for divorce in 2011 — making for some pretty wild connections! In the years since, <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/10/16/blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-baby-girl-picture-first-photo/">Ryan married Blake</a> and has had three kids, while Scarlett was married to <b>Romain Dauriac </b>until 2017. Colin finished the skit by referring to Ryan as his “best friend” — does that mean Ryan and Blake could get an invite to Colin and ScarJo’s wedding?!</p>
      <p>Fans immediately began reacting to the appearance, <i>and </i>wondering if there was any backstage tea between Ryan and Colin. “Just realized Ryan Reynolds’s ex wife, Scarlett Johansson is now Colin Jost’s current fiance 😮,” <a href="https://twitter.com/tokingblackgirl/status/1198475346816974848">@tokingblackgirl</a> tweeted. “RYAN REYNOLDS USED TO BE MARRIED TO SCARJO AND NOW JOST IS ENGAGED TO HER WHAT IS THE BACKSTAGE DYNAMIC I NEED TO KNOW #SNL,” <a href="https://twitter.com/laurenleti/status/1198474383033020416">@laurenleti</a> added — girl, us too! “Is this awkward? Ryan Reynolds is ScarJo’s ex-husband. And sitting there with Colin Jost. #snl,” <a href="https://twitter.com/DayNewYork/status/1198474933728403456">@DayNewYork</a> also tweeted.</p>

      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/will-ferrell/"><b>Will Ferrell</b></a>, 52, returned to the <i>Saturday Night Live </i>stage for his fifth time as co-host and he was just a <i>little</i> distracted in his opening monologue by Ryan, as well. The actor, who was a regular cast member on <i>SNL </i>from 1995 to 2002, began by addressing his longstanding history on the show. “It’s great to be back at Studio 8H, I was a cast member for seven years and really had some of the best times,” he said — only to take notice of a guy in the front row who turned out to be none other than Ryan himself.</p>

      <p>“Excuse me, you look a lot like Ryan Reynolds — is it you?” Will asked. “Thank you, yes it is me,” Ryan replied, adding that he’s a “huge fan.” Will couldn’t believe that Ryan — a.k.a. <i>Deadpool </i>— made the trek down to the NBC studios to see him! “I can’t believe you’re here. Ryan Reynolds is here,” Will announced to the audience, completely thrown off his game. “Backstreets Back, alright!” the comedian sang in excitement, as Ryan urged him to “stop looking at me” and stick with the script. Unable to contain his um, inner fangirl, Will then started impersonating former <i>SNL</i> cast member <b>Tracy Morgan</b> who also joined the opening! “Ryan Reynolds, you listen to me,” Tracy urged Ryan. “Will can do whatever he wants!” Talk about a star-studded opener!</p>
