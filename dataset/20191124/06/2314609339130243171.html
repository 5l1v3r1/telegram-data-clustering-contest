      <h1>Warring Liberals fail to reach truce in Victorian preselections stoush</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:25:41+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:25</time> by <a rel="author">Noel Towell</a></address>
      <p>Weekend peace talks between Victorian Liberal federal MPs and their party's administration have failed to produce a truce in their bitter row.</p>
      <p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and other MPs and Senators met with members of the party's Administrative Committee on Saturday in an effort to dissuade them from <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53aqy.html">opening Victorian seats for preselections in January</a>, up to two-and-half years out from a national election.</p>

      <p>The talks were held in Ballarat at the party's State Council, which was told by its Victorian Leader, Michael O’Brien, that it <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53dj6.html">must become more positive</a> to compete against the Andrews Labor government.</p>
      <p>Mr O’Brien told the Liberals meeting in Ballarat on Sunday morning that being seen by voters as the “party of ideas” was the key to recovering from last year’s devastating state election loss.</p>

      <p>Mr Frydenberg, who <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53dfe.html">addressed the council</a> on Saturday, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison fear preselection brawls and challenges to sitting members will open up fault lines in the party at a time when the federal leadership wants stability.</p>
      <p>But time is running out for a change of heart among the committee members, many of who remain angry after the party's rank-and-file were denied a vote on candidates for this year's election campaign and are determined to prevent a repeat.</p>
      <p>Some of those present at the talks in Ballarat on the weekend say the discussions were cordial but that no agreement was reached.</p>
      <p>With the committee nearly evenly split on the question, Mr Frydenberg's camp needs only to convince one member to change their vote to have the preselections postponed.</p>
      <p>But state party president Robert Clark, a driving force behind the push for early preselctions, appeared unmoved by efforts to persuade him to change his mind.</p>
      <p>The committee meets again in mid-December.</p>

      <p>Speaking in Ballarat on Sunday, the party's state leader Michael O'Brien urged the parties to the dispute to keep talking.</p>
      <p>"People of good conscience can have a a disagreement," Mr O'Brien said.</p>

      <p>"Both Robert and Josh are great people, great Liberals of great conscience.</p>
      <p>"The past practice has always been that the state and federal parties respect each other when it comes to these sort of questions and I've indicated to Josh that I'm happy to support the federal position on that basis."</p>
      <p>The leader also used the gathering to launch an ambitious policy to stop any Victorian household rubbish going to landfill within 16 years, promising new technology to burn waste material, generating enough electricity to power two large regional cities.</p>
      <p>Mr O'Brien said the technology to make the "zero to landfill" policy possible was already available and he committed $120 million to start to fit-out the state’s recycling depots and other waste facilities to allow waste-to energy activity.</p>
      <p>Mr O’Brien pointed to Australian Paper’s $600 million plans for a waste-burning power plant to fuel its mill at Maryvale in the state’s east.</p>
      <p>“In just five years, the Hallam tip will be full,” he said.</p>
      <p>“That will mean hundreds of thousands of truck trips taking waste from Melbourne’s south-east to the west because Labor has no plan to resolve their waste crisis.”</p>
