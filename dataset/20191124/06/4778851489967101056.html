        <b>Boris Johnson has warned that the SNP will “tear apart our incredible union” as he pledged to stop a second referendum on independence.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Prime Minister will today unveil the Tories <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/general-election">election</a> manifesto as the party sets out a £14.3 billion tax “bombshell” facing Scotland under the SNP and Labour tax plans.</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson said: “There is a clear choice for voters across Scotland in this election: a vote for the Scottish Conservatives who will stop a second independence referendum and focus on investing in Scotland’s future, or a vote for the SNP to prop up Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street and tear apart our incredible Union.</p>

      <p>The Scottish Tories, who will publish their own manifesto next week, have today published new research setting out a £14.3 billion tax bill for Scotland. This includes an additional £500 million for Scottish income tax and a potential £42 million on the workplace parking levy under the SNP. It also includes £387 million in capital gains tax, £2.2 billion in corporation tax and</p>
      <p>£11 billion in North Sea windfall tax under Labour.</p>
      <p>“Scotland is already the highest taxed part of the UK, but this shows the unholy alliance of Sturgeon and Corbyn would squeeze Scots dry,” said Scots Tory leader Jackson Carlaw.</p>
      <p>But SNP economy spokeswoman Kirsty Blackman said a decade of Tory cuts to Scotlnd’s budget will reach £14.8 billion next year.</p>
      <p>She said: “The Tories will always prioritise the rich over the poor and if we had followed their lead on tax policy, we would have £500 million less to spend next year on the NHS and other vital services. The SNP has delivered a more progressive tax system in Scotland that protects lower and middle income taxpayers.”</p>
