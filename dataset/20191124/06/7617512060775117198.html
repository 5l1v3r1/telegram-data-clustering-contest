      <p>An Oak Bay councillor wants to ban gas-powered leaf blowers in the municipality as a way to take action on climate change at a local level.</p>
      <p>Tara Ney is proposing the ban to demonstrate specific actions that municipalities can take to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
      <p>Like many local governments in the region, Oak Bay council has declared a climate emergency.</p>
      <p>“This is an opportunity to take some action that will make a real difference in our community to address climate change, and human health and well-being,” Ney said.</p>
      <p>She points to research by the California Air Resources Board, a state agency tasked with protecting the public from the effects of air pollution, to show the effect gas-powered leaf blowers have on emissions.</p>
      <p>According to the agency, using the best-selling commercial leaf-blower for one hour emits as much smog-forming pollution as driving about 1,770 kilometres in a 2017 Toyota Camry. By contrast, the agency equates the emissions from one hour of lawn mower use to driving about 480 km in the same vehicle.</p>
      <p>Ney’s motion also seeks to address noise pollution in Oak Bay, something she said she hears a lot of complaints about.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never had so much response on any one issue in 10-plus years on council. This is an issue that hits a nerve in our community,” Ney said.</p>
      <p>James Gifford, who owns Green Heron Garden Service and Lawn Care, said he wouldn’t work in Oak Bay if Ney’s motion passes.</p>
      <p>“There’s no way I could work in a cost-effective manner without a gas leaf blower and provide the level of service demanded at a price that anybody would be willing to pay,” Gifford said.</p>
      <p>He said he sympathizes with people who don’t like the noise, and he doesn’t enjoying inhaling the fumes from gas-powered blowers, but he couldn’t provide the level of service customers expect with a rake and a broom, or electric leaf blowers.</p>
      <p>Kara Wouters, owner of Pacific Organic Landscape Design, does about 30 per cent of her work in Oak Bay. She said although gas-powered blowers make her job easier, she wouldn’t mind using a rake for jobs in Oak Bay. But a ban would mean higher prices for customers in the municipality, whether they support Ney’s motion or not.</p>
      <p>Wouters said she supports climate action and would use battery-operated leaf blowers if she could afford them, but they’re still significantly more expensive than gas-powered blowers.</p>
      <p>Ney said the municipality needs to take landscapers’ concerns seriously, but it’s the government’s job to set policy and let innovation follow.</p>
      <p>“If we can work towards the banning of these leaf blowers, we can talk more generally about cleaner and quieter neighbourhoods,” she said.</p>
      <p>Ney proposed a similar ban in 2014.</p>
      <p>Oak Bay council will consider the motion at a council meeting on Monday evening.</p>
