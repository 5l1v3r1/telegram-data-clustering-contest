      <h1>Deontay Wilder's message to Tyson Fury after KO win over Luis Ortiz</h1>
      <h2>Wilder is scheduled to rematch Fury on February 22 in Las Vegas after his seventh-round win over Ortiz</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:11:56+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:11</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Deontay Wilder knocked out Luis Ortiz and then warned Tyson Fury: You're next.</p>
      <p>Wilder was outboxed for six rounds by the tricky Cuban in Las Vegas on Saturday night but detonated his right hand in the dying seconds of the seventh session.</p>
      <p>Ortiz rose to his feet too slowly and the referee waved the fight off as Wilder retained his heavyweight world title.</p>
      <p>And the American insisted he will be ready for his rematch with Fury which is scheduled for February 22.</p>
      <p>"Fury is next," said Wilder. "Then I want a unification fight with whoever wins, Anthony Joshua or Andy Ruiz Jr.</p>
      <p>"We're ready for Fury and hopefully he's ready for me. I know his trainer is here and I hope he got some notes down.</p>

      <p>"I'm ready to go at any given time and any given moment and February is looking like our time.</p>
      <p>"I was very confident in my ability and my skill. I tell people all the time that my intellect in the ring is very high so I know exactly what I'm doing.</p>
      <p>"I had to calculate Ortiz perfectly; he's a very dangerous fighter that's why no other heavyweight wanted to give him the opportunity.</p>
      <p>"These guys have to be perfect for 12 rounds, I have to be perfect for two seconds and every time I prove that.</p>

      <p>"It was a game plan, I had to calculate with him. I wasn't getting tired or fatigued, I was having a lot of fun. he was getting tired, once i had my range and distance, it was goodnight."</p>
      <p>Ortiz looked to have tied Wilder up in knots and was seconds away from the end of the round when he was dumped on the canvas.</p>
      <p>The Cuban said: "This is boxing, I told everybody that it was going to be him or me and that it wasn't going to go 12 rounds.</p>
      <p>â€œI was clear-headed. When he said seven I was trying to get up but the count was maybe quicker than I thought."</p>
