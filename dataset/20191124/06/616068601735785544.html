      <p>CRIME:           BREAK-IN AT PUB</p>
      <p>DATE:             November 17, 2019</p>
      <p>RCMP FILE:    2019-72088</p>
      <p>Security personnel from Turtle Bay Pub located on Woodsdale Road in Lake Country contacted RCMP at about 5 a.m. on November 8th when an alarm was activated at the premises.  Upon arrival, the front door was found damaged and insecure, however nothing else was damaged or missing.  Surveillance video shows two suspects entering the premises and attempting to move the ATM before being spooked by the alarm.  On November 17th another break-in was reported, this time the suspects managed to hook up a chain and cable around the ATM, but luckily they didn’t bring enough chain so had to leave empty-handed when the alarms sounded.  A witness watched the two suspects run to an older model dark truck, possible a Ford, and drive northbound toward Vernon. </p>
