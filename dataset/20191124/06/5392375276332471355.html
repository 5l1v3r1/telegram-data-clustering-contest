      <p>With its front panel, the Redmi K30 will look like the Samsung Galaxy S10+, the designers have opted for a dual punch-hole display in order to minimize the frames. Now, the latest <a href="https://twitter.com/TechMate01/status/1198124662082789376">news</a> is that the main camera will be round.

Where artificial intelligence will help to create high-quality photos.</p>
