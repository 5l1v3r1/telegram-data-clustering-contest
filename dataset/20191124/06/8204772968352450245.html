      <p>Castles, five-star hotels and upmarket department stores are just some of the venues proving to be popular locations to indulge in the ritual of afternoon tea. With Christmas approaching, many of them are rolling out festive editions of their lavish spreads. Here are a few to choose from.</p>

      <h4>Luttrellstown Castle</h4>
      <p>This fairytale castle in Castleknock is only open on certain dates during the year, but for each Sunday during December, as well as Monday 23rd, it will welcome guests for afternoon tea.</p>
      <p>This year the tea has a Victorian theme, in honour of Queen Victoria who made two visits to the estate. It features sandwiches of smoked Knockanore cheddar with homemade Branston pickle, and roast pork loin with cranberry stuffing and apple relish. Sweet treats include plain scones as well as cinnamon and rum and raisin varieties, served with clotted cream, and a miniature Victoria sponge.</p>
