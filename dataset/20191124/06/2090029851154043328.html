      <blockquote>I wanna give a concise testimony of what happened to me lately.<br/>Read and pay keen interest.<br/>God’s Grace is big enough<br/><br/>25/10/2019<br/>The above date happened to be d of my jean carnival for my final year week, same day UNIBEN got her new VC, same day UNIBEN got her new VC, same day I planned traveling for Miss Nigeria audition, date for the audition was 26/10/2019, 8am, @owerri<br/><br/>After my jean carnival, I took off to the park to get a bus, heading for Owerri, my Audition venue.<br/><br/>Before I left school, my body kept giving me signs to go back to my hostel, but I insisted on traveling, i got to maingate there was no bus, finally I got a bus, went to the pack but unfortunately no bus at the park, i kept resisting my body sign bcs Miss Nigeria audition is slated for the next day 26/10/2019, 8 am. I didn’t want to miss out<br/><br/>Finally I saw a bus already filled but with one space left @agbor park, I boarded the bus (18 seater) I told dm I wanted to stop at onisha, since it was getting late, some passengers were highlighting, while some were entering, I was focused on where I was going, little did i know, I enter a wrong bus… the bus kept driving.. we got to agbor, most of the passengers came down left with few of them.<br/><br/>The conductors came to meet me and said, go to the front seat, we wanna load new passenger, so he will pick on the way, it’s was passed 8:00pm…. later the driver said to me (Lydia Okojie) the vehicle light is bad and he would want me to pass the night in the hotel, I told him I don’t want to he should take me to Onitsha, where I told them I was going.<br/><br/>Not up to 5 seconds the vehicle light returned to normal, ds time he was driving on speed, it down on me that i just entered RITUALIST VEHICLE he lefy the high way and turned right ward, he kept driving on speed, I could jump down cos it was dark, might not know if there’s a vehicle ahead of me, I messaged a frnd and told him (Hassan) my current location immediately and dropped my phone back in my bag they knew i wrote someone. The got to a lonely place and packed the vehicle, asked me to come down, in the middle of NOWHERE I CRIED FOR MY LIFE.<br/><br/>Just few weeks to be a graduate… there I was fighting for life, I reminded God of my service in His House, and all the alms I give, d conductor was distracted with my bad, the call distracted the driver, that was my escape moment, I removed my hand from the driver and began to run inside the bush, i didnt even know if where I was running to was where dey where slaughtering.. i kept running and praying my cheeks as i kept running.. the driver couldn’t pursue me again cos he wasn’t with toech and bfr the conductor could turn I ran it was 10:44 pm<br/><br/>I hid in the bush, d driver told d conductor dey have to leave, dt where dey are was a bad spot, i was listening where i was hiding they threw all my things away and drove off.<br/><br/>That lady and her sister-in-law fed me, cloth me, sheltered me and gave me comfiot I came to Benin the next day… didn’t even get to half of my journey… when i got to Benin I remembered my hostel mate told me of the dream she got about me.. i prayed as my strength could carry me.. the result of what happened would have been DEATH, but God reveals to Redeem, His mercies are new every morning.<br/><br/>that’s where I came out but wore my clothes and ran to the high way where i met my Guardian angel, A traveler with her baby, she was scared when she saw me but was bold enough to render help, she didn;t know if i was a Ghost, she was heeding for her sister-in-law house to pass the night to continue her journey the next day<br/><br/>The story would have been an unidentified body found dead in the bush, she followed a yahoo boy, only farmers or hunters could have found LYDIA OKOJIE, how would my parent take it, how would my siblings feel, not to talk about you reading but the story now is different.<br/><br/>Am forever grateful to God<br/><br/>We all underestimate the air we breath, waking up to see the day is a blessing no man can pay for. Life is a gift. I owe all to God.</blockquote>
