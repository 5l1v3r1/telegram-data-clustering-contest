      <p>The striker got the Seasiders back on level terms during the first half of Saturday's clash at Portman Road after Gwion Edwards had given the Tractor Boys an early lead.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old, whose only other goal this season came in the EFL Trophy, slammed home from close range after his initial header from James Husband's cross had been blocked.</p>
      <p>“It was exceptional cross in from James Husband on the left," Nuttall said.</p>
      <p>“I headed it straight away and I’ve seen it blocked, but it’s bounced right in front of me straight away so there wasn’t enough time to be disappointed.</p>
      <p>“It was just about reacting, getting onto the second one and putting it away.</p>
      <p>"I’m delighted to score, it’s been a while coming."</p>
      <p>Nuttall was again involved in the thick of the action in the second half when he was penalised for a handball in the penalty area.</p>
      <p>Ipswich, who had gone 2-1 behind just five minutes previously courtesy of Jay Spearing's spot kick, levelled matters through Luke Garbutt's effort from 12 yards.</p>
      <p>While there's no denying the ball did fall onto Nuttall's arm, Pool will claim there was no intention to stop the ball.</p>
      <p>“It’s a tough one," Nuttall said of the controversial decision.</p>
      <p>“I’ve tried to get my hand out of the way, but I didn’t manage to react quick enough. But I thought it was a bit harsh.</p>
      <p>“The referee had a long look at it and I didn’t think he was going to give it at first, but then when I saw him point to the spot I was devastated.</p>
      <p>“But we just had to carry on, try and get the win while at the same time staying compact and not concede again.</p>
      <p>“It’s a hell of a point, they’re a great side.</p>
      <p>“A point is definitely better than none so we’ve just got to build on this performance.”</p>
