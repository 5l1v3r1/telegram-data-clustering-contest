      <p>WACO, Texas — Charlie Brewer accounted for 296 yards and two touchdowns and No. 13 Baylor wrapped up a spot in the Big 12 championship game with a 24-10 victory over Texas on Saturday, a week after the Bears missed a chance to do so with their first loss of the season.</p>
      <p>The Bears (10-1, 7-1 Big 12, No. 14 CFP) have their sixth 10-win season, and fifth since 2011. This one comes just two years after the school’s only 11-loss season in coach Matt Rhule’s debut when he took over in the aftermath of a sprawling sexual assault scandal that led to two-time Big 12 champion coach Art Briles getting fired 3 1/2 years ago.</p>
      <p>Texas (6-5, 4-4) lost for the third time in four games, ending its long-shot bid to get back to the Big 12 title game for the second year in a row.</p>
      <p>Brewer, the junior quarterback from Austin whose dad and grandfather played for Texas, completed 16 of 25 passes for 221 yards with a touchdown, and ran 18 times for 75 yards and another score. But he left the game for good with 11 1/2 minutes remaining after taking a helmet-to-helmet hit when being tackled at the end of a 5-yard run.</p>
      <p><b>IOWA STATE 41, KANSAS 31:</b> With a chance to finish off the surprisingly tough Jayhawks, Iowa State coach Matt Campbell put the game in sophomore quarterback Brock Purdy's hands.</p>
      <p>Purdy made Campbell look like a genius, closing the door on Kansas with a fourth-down touchdown pass with 1:09 left.</p>
      <p>Purdy threw for 372 yards and four TDs including the game-clinching one on fourth-and-goal from the 4 and Iowa State rallied to beat Kansas 41-31 on Saturday and clinch its third straight winning season.</p>
      <p>La'Michael Pettway had 96 yards receiving and two touchdowns for the Cyclones (7-4, 5-3 Big 12), who've now complied three consecutive winning years just twice in the modern era. Iowa State, under coach Earle Bruce, won eight games each in 1976, 1977 and 1978 before Bruce bolted for Ohio State.</p>
      <p>Carter Stanley threw for 328 yards and three TDs for Kansas, and Pooka Williams ran for 154 yards.</p>
      <p><b>KANSAS STATE 30, TEXAS TECH 27:</b> Joshua Youngblood returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown and Skylar Thompson passed for 246 yards and two touchdowns for the Wildcats.</p>
      <p>Blake Lynch kicked two 32-yard field goals and a 43-yarder for Kansas State (7-4, 4-4 Big 12), which snapped a two-game losing streak.</p>
