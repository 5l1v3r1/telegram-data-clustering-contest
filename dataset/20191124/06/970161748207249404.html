      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/deontay-wilder/">Deontay Wilder</a> has assured fans the rematch with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tyson-fury/">Tyson Fury</a> will go ahead after his demolition of Luis Ortiz in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>The WBC champion successfully defended his belt with a seventh-round stoppage, adding <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/19/deontay-wilder-told-dominic-breazeale-loved-chilling-knockout-victory-9598289/">yet another one-punch knockout</a> to his impressive resume.</p>
      <p>Ortiz was ahead on the scorecards when Wilder landed the telling blow and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/frank-warren-deontay-wilder-anthony-joshua-tyson-fury-fight-luis-ortiz-11200797/">he is set to fight Fury next</a>, although the American appeared reluctant to commit to the 22 February date.</p>
      <p>‘Next, of course we have Tyson Fury, the rematch,’ Wilder said in the ring after his victory.</p>

      <p>‘It’s definitely set to be done in February, so we’ll see how that goes.</p>
      <p>‘Then I’m looking for a unification fight. I want one champion, one face, one name. He go by the name of Deontay Wilder.</p>

      <p>‘The heavyweight division is too small to have so many belts, it should just be one champion.</p>
      <p>‘It’s too confusing for the fans. I think I’m the perfect guy for the job.’</p>
      <p>Ortiz was struggling to beat the count when he was knocked down, with the referee deciding the Cuban could not continue.</p>
      <p>The fight had gone Ortiz’s way before the explosive right hand from Wilder and the champion explained he couldn’t take any risks.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘With Ortiz, you can see why no heavyweight wants to fight him, he’s very crafty, he moves strategically and he moves craftily.</p>
      <p>‘I had to measure him in certain places. Some people say I can’t fight on my back feet but that’s my specialty.</p>
      <p>‘I had to go back and forward, my intellect is very good in the ring.</p>
      <p>‘I finally found my measurement, I saw the shot and I took it. He’s one of the best in the world, you’ve got to give him that.’</p>
