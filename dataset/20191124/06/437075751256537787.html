      </p>
      <p>Modidima Mannya asks: As we move on to address South Africa’s obvious troubles, we may have to consider what comes first. Do we want to be trapped in the race trap or do we want every single capable South African on board?</p>

        <b>e</b>
      </p>
      <p>The EFF’s national communications manager Sixolise Gcilishe challenges party leader Julius Malema on the formation of a women’s command, saying if they did not create a special wing to lure men, it should not be done for women either.</p>
      <p>
        <b>ANC Youth League needs its Nasrec moment</b>
      </p>
      <p>The youth league will be rescued by young people who appreciate that the ANC has always been led by the most talented, educated and smart young leaders from its founding through its century of existence, says Yonela Diko.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why is Thabo Zulu in hiding in a free South Africa?</b>
      </p>
      <p>If the state cannot protect whistle-blowers, we need to ask who is the state protecting, writes Omry Makgoale.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why sex education is vital in our schools</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stanely Ncobela says that the more sexual education is injected at the appropriate stages of puberty, the lower the chance of adolescents suffering from consequences of uninformed, unwise and unhealthy sexual activities.</p>
