      <p>Staff at a grassroots agency in Esquimalt that provides programming and support to sex workers have been serving up to 200 meals a day with an oven that never heated up enough and a broken dishwasher.</p>
      <p>After a massive renovation by hundreds of volunteers, Peers Victoria Resources Society has a new kitchen, new floors, new offices, a new classroom and an entirely new space to support clients.</p>
      <p>“There’s only one bathroom I think that really didn’t change,” said Rachel Phillips, executive director of Peers. “It was a gut job.”</p>
      <p>On Saturday, the agency held an event for the community to visit the revamped space.</p>
      <p>The transformation by HeroWork, a charity that completes radical renovations of other charities, will give staff more time and space to support the community.</p>
      <p>“Because our space is organized better, there’s room for growth now, so we can add more programs and have the space to deliver them,” Phillips said.</p>
      <p>Watching 500 volunteers dedicate thousand of working hours to transform the space showed Phillips that the stigma against sex workers isn’t as strong as it once was.</p>
      <p>“This says the community supports sex workers in a very profound kind of way,” she said.</p>
      <p>Sarah Smith, who works at Peers as a drop-in coordinator, said she is most excited about a new heated closet. Smith said many clients come in out of the rain, drenched without a change of clothes. The heated closet means they can dry their clothes and shoes before going back outside.</p>
      <p>Peers supports nearly 600 current and former sex workers annually, providing a range of services from housing and health care to clothing and meals.</p>
      <p>Volunteers started the renovations, valued at more than $625,000, in the first week of October. About 115 companies donated supplies to the renovation, which is HeroWork’s 12th project.</p>
      <p>“The transformation of charity buildings helps to transform charities,” said HeroWork founder and CEO Paul Latour. “When you’re serving in a building that doesn’t work, and it’s ugly and debilitating and inefficient, it’s hard for a charity to operate well.”</p>
      <p>Peers is recruiting new volunteers to help provide programming to the community.</p>
