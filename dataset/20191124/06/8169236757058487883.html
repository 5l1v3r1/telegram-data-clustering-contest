        <b>Arsenal’s decline under Unai Emery has been fairly obvious from watching them on the pitch, with the Gunners no longer the stylish, attack-minded side that they were under Arsene Wenger.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even though Wenger had his problems for much of the second half of his Arsenal reign, he did at least consistently deliver top-four finishes (apart from his last two seasons, at least), and his sides could almost always be guaranteed to put on a show.</p>

      <p>Emery, however, has not yet got Arsenal looking like a top four side as they missed out last season and continue to struggle this term.</p>
      <p>On top of that, the Spanish tactician has his teams playing some dire football as they’re often outplayed even by opponents such as Crystal Palace, Watford and Southampton.</p>
      <p>To sum up just how bad it’s got, this graph from David Wall in the tweet below paints a very clear picture…</p>

      <p>In terms of shot difference, Arsenal were always pretty consistent under Wenger in creating more chances than their opponents.</p>
      <p>AFC were often criticised for not taking those chances, but the drop off in actual shots in comparison to their opponents in Emery’s two seasons is hugely alarming.</p>
      <p>From a shot difference of +170 in Wenger’s final season, Arsenal were down to -32 last year, and are currently on -56.</p>
      <p>It will surely soon be time for change at the Emirates Stadium if Emery cannot get even these basics right.</p>
