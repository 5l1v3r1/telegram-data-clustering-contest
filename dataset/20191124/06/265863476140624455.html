      <h1>Jerod Sechrist From Deadliest Catch Arrested For Shoplifting At Ikea</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:47:42+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:47</time> by <a rel="author">Bridget Hill</a></address>
      <p>According to a report from FoxNews.com, Jerod Sechrist, the Deadliest Catch alum, was detained by authorities in Tampa, Florida, after he supposedly was busted stealing from an Ikea furniture store. The 33-year-old purportedly stole around $1,000 worth of items from the store on Wednesday claims Fox 13.</p>
      <p>Jerod was taken to a Tampa Bay jail and slapped with a grand theft charge. Mr. Sechrist hasn’t posted the bond money yet claims Fox News. The police accused him of stealing multiple items in October as well, however, this was the first time he was caught.</p>
      <p>This won’t be the first time that the reality star was caught by the police though. In October of this year, Mr. Sechrist was arrested for possessing drug paraphernalia as well as heroin. Police apprehended the reality star on the 5th of October after acquiring an arrest warrant for a reckless driving incident.</p>

      <p>After they took him into the jail, the police found he was carrying heroin. Reported first by TMZ.com, the site claims the star appeared in three episodes of the Discovery series three years ago in 2016.</p>
      <p>While on the show, Sechrist claimed he had a lot of experience crab fishing but didn’t perform well on the boat. In August of the same year, Jake Harris, another fisherman who appeared in Deadliest Catch until 2012, was slapped with an 18-month sentence.</p>
      <p>The police reportedly chased him in the state of Washington, USA. Jake was arrested for a number of charges, including possession with intent to manufacture or deliver heroin as well as driving under the influence. There’s no question that reality stars don’t always go on to big named films and productions.</p>
      <p>Christmas Abbott, a contestant in the 19th season of Big Brother back in 2017, was arrested on a felony charge of criminal mischief on the 6th of November, Tuesday, back in 2018.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Abby Lee Miller from Dance Moms was arrested for fraud and tax evasion and even served time in prison. Following her release, she was diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma and has been fighting it ever since.</p>
