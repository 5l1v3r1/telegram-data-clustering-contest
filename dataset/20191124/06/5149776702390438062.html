      <h1>'It's such an exciting time for the city' - Residents react to Nottingham's huge southside redevelopment</h1>
      <h2>'I think the city will be unrecognisable when it's all done'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Reid</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham residents have said the city is going through "one of its most exciting times" as the £600m southside redevelopment progresses.</p>
      <p>The Broadmarsh is currently undergoing a major £89m regeneration <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/broadmarsh-redevelopment-whats-happening-what-1968027">that will bring a cinema and bowling alley to the shopping centre.</a> It is expected to be completed in summer 2021.</p>
      <p>The redevelopment of the shopping centre is part of a wider £250 million regeneration scheme of the Broadmarsh area, which includes the demolition and rebuild of the car park and bus station.</p>
      <p>Broadmarsh's revamp programme forms part of the £600m worth of regeneration in the southside area of the city such as at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/education">Nottingham College</a>, Station Street and Unity Square.</p>
      <p>The new Nottingham College City Hub represents a £58m investment in education for the city - with an expected completion date in September 2020.</p>
      <p>Nottingham <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-castle">Castle</a> is also undergoing a £30m transformation.</p>
      <p>Residents said they expected the area to be "unrecognisable" once all the work is completed.</p>
      <p>Jordan Woodward, 26, of St Ann's, said: "It's really one of the city's most exciting times, I reckon. Seeing all the cranes and investment is really positive. If it helps people getting jobs and brings money in then I'm all for it.</p>
      <p>"I walk past the work most days to work and it seems to be going up rapidly. It's really cool."</p>

      <p>Corey Flint, 28, an IT technician, of the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-city-centre">city centre</a>, said: "I think the city will be unrecognisable when it's all done.</p>
      <p>"Nottingham has been crying out for investment of this scale for years. I think it will go a long way to helping the city compete. My personal favourite will be the castle. I can't wait to see what they've done with that."</p>
      <p>Kirsty Wood, 33, of Sneinton, added: "I'm most looking forward to the Broadmarsh all done up. It needs a bit of love to bring it back.</p>
      <p>"Shopping should be good fun, I hope there's lots of choice. I am enjoying seeing all the work go on. It's a good time to live here."</p>
      <h3>'Thousands more visitors'</h3>

      <p>Nottingham City Council Leader, David Mellen, said: “There’s a real sense of progress and excitement about the way the city’s southside is being reshaped and repurposed. With the cranes and new developments come opportunities for local people and local businesses.</p>
      <p>"Once everything is complete the area will be almost unrecognisable from how it used to be and that transformation will help to breathe new life into this part of the city.</p>

      <p>“A buzzing college hub and huge new offices along with new flats will attract thousands of students and workers, while new shops, leisure outlets, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/">bars and cafes</a> and a fantastic modern Central Library - all surrounded by pleasant pedestrian-friendly streets - will attract more visitors, who can arrive at a new car park, new bus station or the well-connected train and tram facilities.</p>
      <p>"And of course thousands more visitors are expected to be attracted to our revitalised Nottingham Castle experience.”</p>

      <p>Nottingham College CEO John van de Laarschot added: “Thanks to funding from the city council and the Local Enterprise Partnership, the college is able to develop a truly iconic building that offers students top class facilities, gives them a first-rate college experience and prepares them for employment or higher level study.</p>
      <p>"We’re on track for completion in September 2020 and, once complete, the City Hub will become a real focal point for the redevelopment of the whole Southside area.</p>
      <p>"We’re proud to play our part in the regeneration of a significant area of our city centre, improving not only the economic prosperity of the southside zone but leaving a fantastic lasting legacy for further education in Nottingham.”</p>
