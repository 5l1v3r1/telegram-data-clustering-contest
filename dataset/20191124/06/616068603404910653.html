      <p>Kelowna is going the wrong way when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p>The city has set a target of reducing GHG emissions by four per cent compared to 2007 levels by 2023.</p>
      <p>However, in 2017, the last year data is available, emissions actually increased by nearly six per cent.</p>
      <p>Figures in a report for council on the city's Community Climate Action Plan shows GHG emissions since 2007 have fluctuated wildly. In 2010, the city had reduced its output by 4.7 per cent, while in 2016, that number had dropped to 2.8 per cent.</p>
      <p>"Variations in emissions are noted from year to year, which can in part be due to weather factors," the report states.</p>
      <p>"The concerning trend, however, is the community is losing ground and has not been able to achieve the same degree of absolute emission reduction that was achieved in 2010. Progression on absolute emission reductions is paramount to limiting the extent and impacts of climate change."</p>
      <p>The report goes on to say while 2018 data is not available, it is encouraging that fuel sales in the community have declined by about three per cent over 2017 figures. Fuel sales in 2017 had spiked by six per cent over the previous year.</p>
      <p>The report also shows the city has made some strides in implementing the 47 actions endorsed by council last year.</p>
      <p>To date, 32 of the 47 identified actions are either complete, ongoing or in progress.</p>
      <p>Some of those include implementation of the Energy Step Code which will begin implementation next month, policies around the Pedestrian and Bicycle Master Plan and Transportation Master Plan, and a retrofit and electric vehicle strategy through a grant from FortisBC.</p>
      <p>The city's climate action plan seeks a reduction from 2007 levels of 25 per cent by 2033 and 80 per cent by 2050.</p>
      <p>"In order to make significant progress on the targets, it is imperative that everyone – residents, businesses, industry, and senior levels of government – do their part.</p>
      <p>"The city’s actions are essential to support a transition to lower emissions, but it will ultimately be a shift in the community’s behaviour and regulation at the senior government level that is necessary to achieve the targets."</p>
