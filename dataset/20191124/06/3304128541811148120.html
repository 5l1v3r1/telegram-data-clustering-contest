      <p>The Eastmatt supermarket supervisor, who was recently caught on camera assaulting a female cashier in Kajiado, has been arrested.</p>
      <p>The man identified as Ibrahim Taraiya had reportedly been arrested on Tuesday when he assaulted Sharon Atieno but was re-arrested on Saturday after the CCTV footage went viral.</p>
      <p>Reports indicate that Taraiya was freed on Wednesday after Sharon allegedly withdrew the case.</p>
      <p>For the better part of Friday and Saturday, netizens shared the video widely forcing the Directorate of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji to order for his arrest.</p>
      <p>“The ODPP has ordered for immediate arrest of Ibrahim Taraiya, a supervisor at Eastmatt Supermarket in Kajiado for assaulting a teller,” the DPP statement reads in part.</p>

      <p>The DPP said the man will be arraigned in court on Monday to take plea on the assault charges to be levelled against him.</p>
      <p>In the video, Taraiya is seen slapping the cashier several times before pulling her by the hair and then hitting her again several times.</p>
      <p>The incident angered netizens as it took time before a man restrained Sharon’s assailant.</p>
      <p>Eastmatt on Saturday morning issued a statement confirming that the man, who had earlier been identified as a customer, was their employee.</p>

      <p>The management said that he had been suspended.</p>
      <p>“We as EastMatt condemn and do not stand for such heinous acts of disrespect against out staff more so women. the individual in question acted solely and has since been suspended with a report officially being filed at Kajiado County Police,” read the statement.</p>
      <p>Sharon, the management said is receiving treatment at a local hospital following the assault.</p>
