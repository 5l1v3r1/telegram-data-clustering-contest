        <b>Arsenal are reportedly up against Inter Milan in a transfer battle for exciting Brazilian wonderkid Reinier Jesus.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 17-year-old looks a hugely promising attacking midfield talent who could be the next big thing from Brazil to make a career for himself in Europe.</p>

      <p>Arsenal did well to sign another teenage talent from Brazil during the summer as they brought in Gabriel Martinelli, who has made a fine start to life at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>And now, it’s being claimed by the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10406535/arsenal-inter-milan-transfer-reinier-aubameyang/">Sun</a> that they’re alongside Inter in the running for this potential £60million transfer deal.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are targeting a move for Reinier amid doubts over the future of star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, so he could be being eyed as a long-term replacement, the Sun’s report suggests.</p>
      <p>Most Arsenal fans would surely agree that some investment is needed as soon as possible after a poor start to the season.</p>
      <p>Still, many would probably also argue that the priority should be changing the manager as Unai Emery seems to be badly struggling to get the best out of this squad.</p>

      <p>The Spanish tactician has, however, tended to be quite good at bringing young players through, so could perhaps do with a big talent like Reinier coming in as another option.</p>
      <p>If, however, there is some chance of losing Aubameyang, as the Sun mention, it’s surely going to take more than just signing youngsters like this to fill the void.</p>
