      <p>The jailbreak community is bustling with new activity this holiday season, and much of the newfangled excitement comes by way of the checkra1n team’s unpatchable <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/checkra1n/">checkra1n</a> jailbreak, which leverages @axi0mX’s checkm8 bootrom exploit to liberate almost any A7-A10 device from the iPhone 5s to the iPhone X. Best of all, all of this works on <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/ios-13/">iOS 13</a> – Apple’s latest and greatest mobile operating system.</p>
      <p>If you’re in the market for <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/jailbreak-apps-tweaks/">jailbreak tweaks</a> and add-ons that will make your jailbroken handset more exciting, then you’ve come to the right place. This roundup will encompass all the latest jailbreak tweaks from Monday, November 18<sup>th</sup> to the Sunday, November 24<sup>th</sup>. As always, we’ll kick things off by discussing our favorite releases and then wrap things up with a brief outline of the rest.</p>
      <h3>Our favorite releases this week</h3>
      <h4>AdaptiveDarkMode – FREE</h4>

      <p>Dark mode is one of my favorite features of iOS 13, but Apple leaves a lot to be desired in the toggling department. Here to help is a newly released jailbreak tweak called <b>AdaptiveDarkMode</b>, which raises the bar for conditional dark mode toggling on any jailbroken iOS 13 device.</p>
      <p>Two of my favorite things this tweak can do is enable dark mode when Do Not Disturb or Low Power Mode is turned on. These features work great with dark mode, especially because it’s easy on the eyes and the battery.</p>
      <p>You can learn more about AdaptiveDarkMode and how it can augment your life <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/18/adaptivedarkmode/">in our full review</a>.</p>
      <h4>Continuty – $1.00</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>One of the most intimate forms of customization that an iPhone user gets right out of the box is setting a custom wallpaper for their Home screen, but due to the iPhone’s tall (versus widescreen) display, some of the nicest desktop wallpapers just don’t look right.</p>
      <p><b>Continuity</b> is a jailbreak tweak that fixes this problem by making widescreen wallpapers scrollable as you swipe through the Home screen’s pages. It makes any widescreen wallpaper iPhone-friendly, and I’d recommend to anyone with a jailbreak. I hope Apple will implement something like this into native iOS at some point in the future.</p>
      <p>You can learn more about Continuity and how it works <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/18/continuity/">in our full review</a>.</p>
      <h4>ipadify – FREE</h4>

      <p>There are a handful of awesome features that Apple seems to safe especially for iPadOS that would also fare well on the iPhone. The same can be said about certain mobile apps, which would run just fine on the iPhone, but are (for some reason) limited to Apple’s tablet platform.</p>
      <p>With a new jailbreak tweak called <b>ipadify</b>, you can enjoy native Picture-in-Picture video playback from most apps on the iPhone and you can also use a handful of iPad-only apps on the iPhone, such as the new Photoshop app from Adobe.</p>
