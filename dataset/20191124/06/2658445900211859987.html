      <h3>Osagie Otabor, Benin</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>THE Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), a subsidiary of NNPC, said it has provided scholarships for over 2000 undergraduates from its host communities.</p>
      <p>Managing Director of NPDC, Mr. Mansur Sambo, who spoke to newsmen at the pre-selection examination for indigent students of the company’s host communities said 4000 undergraduates have participated in its scholarship examinations.</p>
      <p>He stated that the pre-selection examination was taking place simultaneously in Delta, Imo and Rivers.</p>
      <p>“This year, over 300 students are participating in the scholarship examinations, after which the successful students will be awarded the scholarship.</p>

      <p>The number reduced this year because our assets reduced. The scholarship scheme is not a one year scheme but the one that will take them through the university untill they graduate. But the scheme does not include employment.</p>
      <p>We have also donated science books, e-library, chairs and desks to OML 111 host communities and about 150 tricycles to OML 40 host communities.</p>
      <p>So, we will continue to do our best to ameliorate the untold hardships in the communities. The main thrust of NPDC corporate social responsibility policy is education. The relevant of education in any society cannot be overemphasized,” he said.</p>
