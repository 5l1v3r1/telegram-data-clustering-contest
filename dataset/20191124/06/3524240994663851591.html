      <p>The Peoples Democratic Party says it will reform itself following its loss to the All Progressives Congress during the November 16 governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states.</p>
      <p>In an interview, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, on Saturday said the reforms would involve membership drive and an overhaul of the party’s workings.</p>
      <p>During the governorship elections, the PDP candidate in Kogi State, Mr Musa Wada, lost to the APC’s and incumbent governor, Mr Yahaya Bello, while in Bayelsa State, the PDP candidate, Mr Douye Diri, also lost to the APC’s, Mr David Lyon.</p>
      <p>Also, the PDP candidate at the 2019 presidential election, Atiku Abubakar, recently lost to the APC’s President Muhammadu Buhari at both the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal and the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>Following the losses, Ologbondiyan said, “There will be reforms in the party, starting from membership drive and also an overhaul of the internal workings of the party.</p>
      <p>“We would see how we can prepare ahead of future elections. We are working on the modalities to improve on our membership drive. It will come in any form.”</p>
      <p>The PDP also said the party did not have confidence in the Independent National Electoral Commission led by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu to deliver credible elections in the future.</p>
      <p>He alleged the commission had become partisan and favouring the APC.</p>
      <p>“If he (Yakubu) is not removed from INEC, his tenure will spell doom for our nation’s democracy. We do not have confidence in INEC under him to conduct credible elections,” he said.</p>
      <p>Also, the Chairman, PDP Board of Trustees, Senator Walid Jibrin, said the party would be strengthened and made more united.</p>
      <p>He stated that the BoT had formed various committees to assist its leadership.</p>
