      <p>The WWE Draft and NXT's move to the USA Network changed the landscape of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> entirely. With Superstars being more exclusive their respective brands, the WWE Universe were eagerly waiting as to how this year's <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">Survivor Series</a> will pan out. The addition of NXT to the mix took the PPV up a notch.</p>
      <p>The buildup to the PPV also helped a lot as we got to see some memorable invasions from all three brands in the last few weeks. With NXT TakeOver: WarGames (full results <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/wwe-nxt-takeover-wargames-2019-results-november-23rd-takeover-wargames-grades-video-highlights">here</a>) already setting the pace, this weekend could turn out to be a very memorable one for the WWE Universe.</p>
      <p>There will be three title defenses as Bray Wyatt will square off against Daniel Bryan for the Universal Championship, Brock Lesnar will lock horns with Rey Mysterio in a No Holds Barred Match for the WWE Championship and Adam Cole putting his NXT Championship on the line against Pete Dunne.</p>
      <p>The focus, however, will be on the Triple Threat matches. The biggest one of them all will be the one between Becky Lynch, Shayna Baszler and Bayley. With each of these competitors taking rough shots at each other, it would be very difficult to pick a winner in this dream match.</p>
      <p>The traditional elimination matches, will also feature all three brands as the likes of Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns will be leading the Men's teams of RAW and SmackDown respectively. Team NXT is yet to be revealed.</p>
      <p>The Women's Team for both RAW and SmackDown are solid with Charlotte Flair and Sasha Banks leading the charge for both team. It was revealed after WarGames that Rhea Ripley will lead Team NXT which will also consist of Toni Storm, Io Shirai, Bianca Belair and Candice LeRae.</p>
      <p>Which brand will reign supreme at this year's Survivor Series?</p>
      <p>Guess you will have to tune-in to find out!</p>
