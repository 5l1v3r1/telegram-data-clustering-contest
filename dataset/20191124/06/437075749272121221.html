      <h1>Zille wins with Ngwenya return</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T06:36:44+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 06:36</time> by <a rel="author">S'thembile Cele</a></address>
      <p>Legal opinion sourced by DA federal council chairperson Helen Zille has given the green light for the return of former MP Gwen Ngwenya as head of policy.</p>
      <p>City Press reported last week that plans were afoot to bring Ngwenya back after her dramatic exit from the party just months before this year’s crucial May 8 polls.</p>
      <p>Zille had last week moved to bring Ngwenya back, but was met with resistance at the level of the federal executive.</p>
      <p>She tried again at last week’s federal council and it is alleged that a lengthy debate about Ngwenya’s return ensued, with many questions asked about whether Zille had the authority to unilaterally make that decision.</p>
      <p>The matter was ultimately deferred to a sitting of the federal executive, where it’s understood that Zille presented the meeting with a legal opinion saying that she had not overstepped in her appointment of Ngwenya, marking Zille’s second major victory since her return.</p>
      <p>A post-federal executive meeting statement confirmed that Ngwenya had been appointed.</p>
      <p>“Considering the party’s policy conference scheduled for April 4 and 5, the federal executive considered the appointment of a head of policy. It is critical that a head of policy is appointed as soon as practically possible to get the ball rolling as it relates to the policy conference. The [appointee] will be tasked with implementing political decisions and direction as it pertains to policy,” the statement read.</p>
      <p>Among those who argued against Ngwenya coming back, some were of the view that she had brought the party into disrepute on social media, specifically on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Insiders allege that Zille responded that no one had come forward to lay a formal complaint against Ngwenya for her conduct.</p>
      <p>Members of the DA federal council have told City Press that a decision was taken by some following the sitting to lay complaints against Ngwenya with the federal legal commission.</p>
