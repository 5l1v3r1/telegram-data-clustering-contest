      <p>In an extraordinary development, Bollywood megastar Salman Khan on Sunday extended his support to Asim Riaz after his fight with Siddharth Shukla dominated the proceedings inside the <i>Bigg Boss </i>house for nearly a week. Speaking to friends and relatives of some of the <i>Bigg Boss </i>contestants, Salman said that Siddharth would have been thrashed if there was someone else in Asim’s place.</p>

      <p>Defending his brother, Umar Riaz told Salman that Siddharth had been frustrating Asim and had resorted to shouting and pushing only when it became unbearable for him. Salman agreed with him as he said, “Yes agree, Asim’s frustration level had reached a tipping point.”</p>
      <p>Salman also said that he had warned Siddharth about his aggression and arrogance all through the show. “I had been telling Siddharth from the beginning that arrogance won’t work. Asim hadn’t pushed him that hard. If there was someone else in place of Asim, Siddharth would have been thrashed,” Salman added.</p>
      <p>Salman said that both Paras and Siddharth were wrong.</p>

      <p>Shefali Jariwala’s husband expressed his displeasure over some objectionable comments made by Paras Chhabra for his wife. He said, “I am hurt. I was ready to sacrifice my life for Paras. I had considered him like my younger brother. But the way he made personal comments about Shefali (linking him with Asim), this was not acceptable.”</p>
      <p>Paras’s girlfriend Akansha Puri felt that Paras had resorted to some dirty games in the house but defended him saying that he was playing his game beautifully. She also said that she had warned him about his behaviour with girls inside the house before he entered the competition.</p>
      <p>Salman had earlier dared Siddharth<a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/salman-khan-lashes-out-at-siddharth-shukla-dares-him-for-physical-fight-either-inside-or-outside-bigg-boss-house/273389/"> for a fight</a> with him either outside the house or inside the reality show house.</p>
