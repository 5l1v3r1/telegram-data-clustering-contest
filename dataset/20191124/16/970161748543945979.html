      <p>Shocking pictures of a malnourished baby boy at hospital in Yemen highlight the stark claim that a child under five dies every 10 minutes due to extreme hunger in the country.</p>
      <p>Doctors are seen treating the infant at Al-Sabeen hospital in the capital of Sana’a on Saturday.</p>
      <p>A nearly five-year-long war has created what the UN calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with at least 12 million children caught up in the conflict.</p>
      <p>The fighting has killed tens of thousands of civilians and driven millions to the brink of famine, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project NGO.</p>
      <p>The UN envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, said on Friday that momentum is building to end the war within the first few months of 2020.</p>

      <p>‘In recent weeks, there have been entire 48-hour periods without air strikes for the first time since the conflict began,’ Mr Griffiths added.</p>
      <p>‘We call this de-escalation, a reduction in the tempo of the war, and perhaps a move towards an overall ceasefire in Yemen.’</p>
      <p>Wrecked health infrastructure and chronic poverty could mean child deaths continuing in numbers well beyond any upcoming truce.</p>
      <p>The bleak statistic on infant deaths was reported by the public health minister in the Iran-backed Houthi-run administration in an address to the UN given at the hospital, according to al-Masirah TV.</p>

      <p>Taha al-Mutawakel added that six newborns also lose their lives every two hours.</p>
      <p>‘We are not demanding toys and video game consoles, but we are calling for incubators and other related devices to give children the right to life,’ Mutawakel said in his address.</p>
      <p>‘Stop shedding tears for our children who get killed, whilst there is no credibility whatsoever in your international reports and they do not help assuage this tragic situation.’</p>
      <p>He went on to claim that 5,000 Yemeni children suffer traumas caused by weapons of mass destruction, some of them internationally banned.</p>
      <p>International experts convened by the UN have accused both sides in the conflict of committing war crimes.</p>
