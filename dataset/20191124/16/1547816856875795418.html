        <b>Bigg Boss 13's latest eviction has a back story that connects to Akshara Singh. who was believed to have moved on from Khesari's camp to Pawan's camp but was actually made a pawn in the war between Pawan and Khesari. Read the juicy story</b>
      </p>
      <p>Well, Khesari Lal Yadav's shocking eviction from Bigg Boss must have made Pawan Singh happy. Pawan is a big star and Khesari's nemesis in Bhojpuri cinema and the two are NOT on talking terms. </p>
      <p>Why do Khesari and Pawan don't see eye to eye? Well, if you recall, Bhojpuri actress Akshara Singh had registered a complaint against Pawan alleging that he and his associates were sending vulgar messages to her. The reason for this abuse was reportedly a press conference held by Akshara revealing that she had a relationship with Pawan that ended on an ugly note.</p>

      <p>Now what you perhaps don't know is the fact that before this fiasco, it was believed in Bhojpuri cinema that Akshara first belonged to Khesari's camp and had later moved on to Pawan's camp. Sooner and not later, Bhojpuri cinema had the unsaid and unwritten war between Pawan and Khesari all over it. The insiders in Bhojpuri cinema tell us that even today, there are two distinct camps when it comes to Khesari and Pawan.</p>

      <p>Another twist came into play when little over a year ago, Akshara went to do on a music video with Khesari. </p>
      <p>"Naturally, Pawan must have not liked Akshara working with Khesari again and hence, today he must be very happy that Khesari is evicted from Bigg Boss 13," says a source from the Bhojpuri industry.</p>

      <p>The source further reveals that Akshara was made a pawn in the Khesari-Pawan war. "Akshara never belonged to any camp per se. Both Pawan and Khesari obtained a good amount of mileage in the press with her name being thrown into thew articles as the bone of contention between them."</p>
      <p>Well, well, well... Pawan, our pages are always open for you if you want to tell us how happy you are feeling about Khesari being shown the door and not making much headway in Bigg Boss 13.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- pinterest, khabarin, laturadelsorigen</i></p>
