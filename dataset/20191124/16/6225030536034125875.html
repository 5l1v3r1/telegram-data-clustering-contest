      <p>Upon its founding in 2017, Amer Abdulaziz Salman’s Phoenix Thoroughbreds made a swift and far-reaching impact on global racing. Self-proclaimed as the “world’s first regulated thoroughbred fund,” Phoenix -- whose investors Abdulaziz has never identified -- paid out vast sums to acquire high-end bloodstock, resulting in major wins around the world.</p>
      <p>This week as part of the trial of Mark Scott, a U.S.-based lawyer who was found guilty of money laundering as part of the international OneCoin cryptocurrency scam, the Racing Post <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/news/phoenix/phoenix-thoroughbreds-founder-accused-of-stealing-eur100m-from-global-ponzi-scam/410788?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=RP%20-%20News&amp;utm_content=-Phoenix%20Thoroughbreds&amp;utm_term=Null"><b>reports Abdulaziz was named as having stolen</b></a> $110 million as part of the fraud and using those funds to launch Phoenix Thoroughbreds.</p>
      <p>Racing Post notes “the stunning claim” was made during the testimony of Konstantin Ignatov, who co-founded the fake cryptocurrency OneCoin. Ingatov, who pleaded guilty to the scam worth an estimated $4 billion, said Abdulaziz was one of the operation’s money launderers.</p>
      <p>“Amer Abdulaziz, after he stole 100 million euros from OneCoin, he started buying racehorses for, like, 25 million euros. [He was] one of the main money-launderers,” Ingatov testified.</p>
      <p>In a Racing Post profile published in September 2018, Abdulaziz said to that point Phoenix had spent $55 million building its global racing operation.</p>
      <p>Phoenix Thoroughbreds has tallied Grade 1 wins in the U.S. and Australia and also been in the winner’s circle at Royal Ascot. Among its notable U.S.-based runners are Gronkowski, who was second in this year’s Dubai World Cup, and Grade 1 winner Dream Tree.</p>
      <p>Abdulaziz has previously declined to reveal any investors in Phoenix, saying only that they are “non-racing people” who don’t wish to be identified.</p>
