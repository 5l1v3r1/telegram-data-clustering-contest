      <p>Goo Hara has been found dead, according to South Korean media, prompting fans to head to the K-pop star’s final Instagram picture in their thousands to post emotional tributes.</p>
      <p>The singer, who was better known as Hara, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/k-pop-star-former-kara-member-goo-hara-found-dead-28-11209087/">was 28 years old.</a></p>
      <p>Her final post to her 1.2 million followers on the photo-sharing site was a selfie, along with the caption ‘goodnight’, which was shared yesterday (23 November 2019).</p>
      <p>It had amassed almost 75,000 comments at the time of writing. Among them were heart-breaking notes such as ‘rest in peace’ and ‘you will be dearly missed and we love you.’</p>
      <p>According to police, Hara was found in her home of Seoul, South Korea, on Sunday evening. The cause of death is being investigated.</p>
      <p>She was a member of the massive-selling girl group Kara, who were active from 2007 to 2015.</p>
