        <b>Koalas have been made "functionally extinct" due to the damage the recent bushfires in Australia have caused.</b>
      </p>
      <p>80 per cent of their habitat has been destroyed by the <a href="https://www.joe.ie/news/koalas-functionally-extinct-bushfires-destroy-80-percent-habitat-687684">fires</a> and that combined with a severe drought has led to many koalas needing to be rescued from the wild.</p>
      <p>Deborah Tabart, chairperson of the Australian Koala Foundation said that over 1,000 koalas have died because of the fires.</p>
      <p>"Functional extinction," according to Forbes, happens when an animal population becomes so small that they no longer can play a significant role in their ecosystem.</p>

      <p>It is possible, as a result, that the population of koalas in Australia will become so limited that they will struggle to reproduce enough to avoid complete extinction altogether.</p>
      <p>Koala's main souce of food comes from eucalyptus trees, many of which have been destroyed by the fires and it is estimated that it will take months for them to grow back, leaving the koalas without any food.</p>
      <p>Port Maquarie Koala Hospital recently set up a GoFundMe page to try and raise money to help the koalas and they have already raised over $1,000,000 and plan to establish a breeding program to save the species.</p>
