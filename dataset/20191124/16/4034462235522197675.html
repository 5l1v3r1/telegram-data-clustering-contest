      <h1>Tuner Builds The Hardcore 4C That Alfa Romeo Won't</h1>
      <h2>Quadrifoglio badges? Pogea Racing don't need no stinkin' Quadrifoglio badges!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:35:32+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:35</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Joseph</a></address>
      <p>Even six and a half years now since it first arrived on the scene, we still have to give kudos to Alfa Romeo for having introduced the 4C in the first place, and for producing it still. Unfortunately, though, it's never given the nimble little mid-engined sports car the power and performance upgrades it arguably deserves. But Pogea Racing has.</p>
      <p>The German tuner has a proven track record at upgrading the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/alfa-romeo/4c-spider">Alfa Romeo 4C</a>, and has now introduced its latest. And while it may not be as potent as the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/this-is-the-500-hp-alfa-romeo-4c-quadrifoglio-of-our-dreams">500-horsepower, limited edition Nemesis</a> it revealed last year, it certainly brings it closer to the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/alfa-romeo/giulia-quadrifoglio">Quadrifoglio</a> territory into which Alfa has refused to take it.</p>

      <p>The enhancements start, of course, under the hood – or rather rear deck, we should say – where Pogea has squeezed even more out of the already high-strung 1.75-liter turbo four than <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/alfa-romeo-4c-gets-the-power-it-deserves">its last version</a>. So instead of 237 horsepower, the Pogea Racing 4C Zeus now produces 354. And where the standard version kicks out 258 lb-ft of torque, this one makes 343. That's enough to send the "little sports car that could" rocketing to 62 in just 3.4 seconds (down from 4.5 in stock form) and on to a top speed quoted at 189 mph (up from 160).</p>

      <p>As you can see, Pogea Racing didn't stop there. It also fitted an upgraded aero kit, including a new front splitter, side skirts, and spoiler, apron and diffuser at the rear – all made in Germany – helping the 4C not only generate more downforce, but better cool its even higher-stressed mechanical components. The tuner also fitted a set of forged alloys measuring 18 inches at the front and 19 at the back, shod with sticky Michelin Pilot Sport 4S rubber and fitted with a front-axle hydraulic lift to clear speed bumps and curbs.</p>

      <p>It also coated this particular example in unique matte Petrol Volturi Pearl paint, and enhanced the interior with new seats and fine leather upholstery.</p>
      <p>None of these upgrades come cheap, though. Pogea will only make 10 of these, and has already sold four. And it charges €50,100 (before tax, or about $55k) just for the enhancements, not including the cost of the donor car that, at about $67k, is still the cheapest mid-engined sports cars on the market this side of a base <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/porsche/718-boxster">Porsche 718 Boxster</a> or the new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/corvette">C8-generation Chevrolet Corvette Stingray</a>.</p>
