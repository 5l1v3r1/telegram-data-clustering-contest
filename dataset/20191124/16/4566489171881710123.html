      <h1>Thousands in Brussels protest violence against women</h1>

      <p>Around 10,000 people took part in a protest march in Brussels on Sunday calling for an end to violence against women, police said, a day after similar demonstrations in France and Italy.</p>
      <p>The protesters in the Belgian capital paid homage to women killed by partners or ex-partners, then marched to the Palace of Justice where they placed pairs of red shoes as a symbol of femicide victims.</p>
      <p>"Belgium is a very complex country with many levels of power; federal, regional and communal and all these levels of powers do little things to tackle violence against women. But the main thing we are demanding is a national plan," said Celine Caudron, one of the organisers of the protest.</p>
      <p>"It is important to punish the perpetrators but what we want most is that the violence doesn't happen in the first place."</p>
      <p>The marchers held up placards bearing messages such as "That's enough" and "Not one more life".</p>
      <p>Also prominent were the names of the 22 women killed by men in Belgium this year.</p>
      <p>Outside the law courts building the demonstrators set off alarms and made noise as a "protest against the silence" which surrounds the deaths of battered women.</p>
      <p>According to Mirabal, a Belgium umbrella group of organisation opposing violence against women, there have been 98 femicides in the country since 2017, a figure "which, in proportion to the population, is well above the average for European nations".</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands marched in France and Italy on Saturday calling for an end to violence against women.</p>
      <p>The marches came ahead of the UN-recognised International day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women on Monday.</p>
