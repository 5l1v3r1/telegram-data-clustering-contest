      <p>The Hornets bossed the first half at Vicarage Road on Saturday but failed to find a breakthrough, and paid a hefty price as Dyche's Clarets fought their way to victory after the break.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chris-wood/"><b>Chris Wood</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ashley-barnes/"><b>Ashley Barnes</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-tarkowski/"><b>James Tarkowski</b></a> all found the net to send Watford bottom of the league and Burnley up to sixth, leaving boss Dyche delighted with his side's grafting qualities.</p>
      <p>And Dyche lauded England goalkeeper Pope for keeping Burnley's defence in check under that first-half pressure.</p>
      <p>He said: "As an attacking team you shape to cross, and you think 'maybe we've got a chance', but then the cross comes in and a big monster like him comes and takes it.</p>
      <p>"A goalkeeper can bring a calmness to a team. The defensive unit kept us in it at half-time.</p>
      <p>"We couldn't get a foothold in the game in that first half. So that resilience to make sure we stayed intact is a very important factor in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"You have to stay in it to win it and we did. I don't think it was a 3-0 performance, Watford gave as good as they got, but you end up taking it, of course.</p>
      <p>"Nick Pope has been brilliant and he'll definitely take confidence from his time with England, and I hope he continues to grow for us now off the back of that."</p>
      <p>Watford boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/quique-sanchez-flores/"><b>Quique Sanchez Flores</b></a> was left to count the cost of a seventh defeat in 13 league matches that saw the Hornets slump to the foot of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>An unwanted club-record 11th consecutive winless home league match compounded Watford's heavy reverse, but the Spaniard remains relaxed about his rebuilding job.</p>
      <p>Defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/craig-dawson/"><b>Craig Dawson</b></a> had complained of dizziness before kick-off and was later forced out of the match after a nasty clash of heads left him with a big cut above his left eye.</p>
      <p>Flores revealed the 29-year-old had been battling a virus and was a doubt to play right up until kick-off, hailing the former West Brom centre-back for his resolve in making it to the pitch in the first place.</p>
      <p>"He was really bad with his stomach before the match," said Flores.</p>
      <p>"He was the best defender in the first half, despite all those problems.</p>
      <p>"He's OK now, he has a cut above his eye.</p>
      <p>"It was tough before the match, but he was very professional to be able to play at all.</p>
      <p>"That kind of spirit was great from him, and hopefully he will be fine quickly.</p>
      <p>"I don't want fans to think it's an excuse, but six consecutive matches to lose a player in the first half, that's not normal.</p>
      <p>"It's incredible, I'm unhappy with that amount of injuries."</p>
