      <h1>Kemba Walker doubtful for Monday with sprained neck</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:33:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:33</time> by <a rel="author">Tim Bontemps</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics">Boston Celtics</a> announced Sunday morning that <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6479/kemba-walker">Kemba Walker</a> is doubtful for Monday night's home game against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sac/sacramento-kings">Sacramento Kings</a> with a neck sprain after his collision with teammate <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3056602/semi-ojeleye">Semi Ojeleye</a> during Friday night's loss in Denver.</p>
      <p>Walker fell to the ground and hardly moved after running headfirst into Ojeleye's midsection in the second quarter against the Nuggets; he was eventually immobilized and stretchered off the court and taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation.</p>
      <p>Before the game had ended, the Celtics announced Walker had been diagnosed with concussion-like symptoms, and later in the evening the team said he had been released from the hospital and allowed to rejoin the team to travel back home following the conclusion of its five-game West Coast swing.</p>
      <p>The Celtics are scheduled to practice Sunday afternoon ahead of Monday's game at TD Garden against the Kings.</p>
      <p>Walker is averaging 21.1 points, 4.6 rebounds and 4.7 assists in his first season with the Celtics after spending the first eight years of his career with the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cha/charlotte-hornets">Charlotte Hornets</a>. The man Walker replaced at point guard for the Celtics, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6442/kyrie-irving">Kyrie Irving</a>, has already been ruled out for the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets">Brooklyn Nets</a> for Wednesday's game between the two teams in Boston, which was supposed to be Irving's first game at TD Garden since joining the Nets as a free agent this summer.</p>
      <p>After hosting Sacramento and Brooklyn this week, the Celtics play in Brooklyn on Friday and at Madison Square Garden against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks">New York Knicks</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Boston is already without forward <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4249/gordon-hayward">Gordon Hayward</a> for the next few weeks after he underwent surgery last week to repair a broken bone in his non-shooting (left) hand. After going 2-3 on their West Coast swing, the Celtics are 12-4 and tied for second in the Eastern Conference.</p>
