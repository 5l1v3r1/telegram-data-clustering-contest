      <p>Niantic, the team behind augmented reality mobile game Pokémon Go, has revealed its upped the game's storage limits.</p>
      <p>In a tweet on the <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1197985622549573633">official Twitter account</a>, it was confirmed Pokémon Go has expanded the capacity limits so the game now offers Pokémon storage and item storage limits of 3,000 and 2,500 respectively.</p>
      <p>"Attention, Trainers!" the tweet exclaims. "The limit on Pokémon storage has now been expanded to 3000. Need more room? Item capacity upgrades now allow you to store up to 2,500 items!"</p>

      <p>The extra space doesn't come free, of course; to unlock the extra room, you'll need to cough up 200 PokéCoins for every additional 50 spaces in either allocation.</p>
