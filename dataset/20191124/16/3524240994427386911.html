        <b>Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, has said the United States laws are only targeted at those who flout them.</p>
      <p>In her reaction to the indictment of the Chief Executive Officer of Air Peace, Allen Onyema,  Onochie said the American government only goes after law breakers. She, therefore, advised Onyema to go to the United States to clear his name.</p>
      <p>The President’s aide said this in a series of tweets on Sunday.</p>
      <p>She lamented the manner in which funds meant for the Niger Delta amnesty programme were allegedly diverted into private pockets.</p>
      <p>The Air Peace boss is believed to have worked as a consultant for the Niger Delta amnesty programme in charge of training repentant militants.</p>
      <p>Onochie said, “I do not understand what President Buhari has to do with Mr. Onyema of Air Peace being indicted and charged in the USA. According to our attorney-general, the Federal Government has not even been informed of the situation.</p>
      <p>“American laws go after those who break them. What a man sows… How much has Nigeria invested in the Niger Delta amnesty programme, NDDC and 13 per cent derivation funds? All, mostly in a black hole (sic).</p>
      <p>“Do we know the extent of poverty, ignorance and disease in the Niger Delta? Please let America too help us see how Niger Delta underdeveloped Niger Delta. Those of us from the Niger Delta who are the direct beneficiaries of the suffering that emanated from the looting of our wealth will tackle them. It is our war that is being fought.</p>
      <p>“Laws, Nigerian or American, go after those who break them; so we must mind our business. QED! We are smarter now than ever before. Gradually, the scales of tribalism, religious affinity and political loyalty are falling off our eyes and being replaced by Nigerianism. Nigerians are not keen on tales by moonlight. Let him return to America to face his accusers.”</p>

      <p>Onyema, who was praised nationwide for helping to evacuate Nigerian victims of xenophobia from South Africa, was indicted last Friday for allegedly laundering suspicious funds in excess of $20m in the US.</p>
      <p>His associate, Ejiroghene Eghagha, was also indicted.</p>
      <p>They were accused of conniving to commit money laundering and bank fraud for several years.</p>
      <p>The allegations also included how Onyema facilitated fraudulent letters of credit to American banks to procure aircraft, equipment and luxury goods.</p>
      <p>The CEO has since denied the charges, promising to clear his name in the United States’ court as necessary.</p>
