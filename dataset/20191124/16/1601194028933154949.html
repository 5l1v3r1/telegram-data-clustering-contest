      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">WWE Survivor Series 2019</a> will witness the Tag Team Champions of all the three brands locking horns in the battle for brand supremacy. RAW will be represented by the reigning champions, The Viking Raiders who have been a dominant force in the division for the last few months.</p>
      <p>SmackDown will be represented by The New Day after Kofi Kingston and Big E defeated The Revival to become the Tag Team Champions for the seventh time. Together, they will look to pick an easy win to earn more points for the Blue brand.</p>
      <p>Lastly, the Undisputed Era will represent NXT as Bobby Fish and Kyle O’Reilly will be hungry to pick up a surprise victory at the Allstate Arena in Chicago.</p>
      <p>As the three teams gear up for their upcoming battle, we take a look at the five potential finishes to this match.</p>

      <p>At WWE Crown Jewel 2019, The Viking Raiders were pinned by The OC who then went on to become the ‘Best Tag Team in the World’. This led many fans to believe that the massive push for the reigning RAW Tag Team Champions was coming to a halt.</p>
      <p>Tonight, they are set to go up against the tag team champions of the other two brands and it would be huge for them if they manage to pick up a clean victory at the PPV. They have shown immense growth ever since their arrival on the main roster. Both Erik and Ivar are a dominant force to reckon with and can turn the tide in favor of the Red brand with a dominant display in their match.</p>
      <p>The Viking Raiders have had a decent run as the RAW Tag Team Champions and can prove to the locker room that they pose a serious threat to the entire division. If they win clean, it will be a member of the Undisputed Era who is most likely to take the pin.</p>
