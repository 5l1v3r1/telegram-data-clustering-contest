      <h1>ESPN Releases Prediction For Oklahoma-Oklahoma State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:45:56+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Rivalry Week is here, and one of the games we’ll have a close eye on is the annual “Bedlam Series” between Oklahoma and Oklahoma State.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen how much Oklahoma’s College Football Playoff chances improved this weekend, but the Sooners did their part by beating TCU last night. A win over the Cowboys would close out a third-straight 11-1 regular season.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma State, meanwhile, has ripped off four wins in a row following a midseason mini-slump. The Cowboys haven’t beaten their in-state rivals since 2014, but a win next weekend would be extra sweet considering everything at stake.</p>
      <p>ESPN has <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401112121">unveiled a prediction</a> for the game. The computer favors the Sooners on the road.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>OU has 74.4 percent chance of winning, according to the FPI. Oklahoma State is at 25.6 percent.</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The television info for the “Bedlam Series” has not been released, but should become available later in the week.</p>
      <p>The game is being played in Stillwater, where the Cowboys haven’t beaten the Sooners since 2011.</p>
