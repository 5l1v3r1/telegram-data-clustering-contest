      <p>Made In Chelsea’s Sam Thompson has jokingly called out Manchester United player Brandon Williams and former player Patrice Evra after he allegedly caught both contacting his girlfriend, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a> star Zara McDermott.</p>
      <p>The two officially got together <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/24/love-islands-zara-mcdermott-and-mics-sam-thompson-go-instagram-official-with-cute-pda-10044159/">earlier this year</a>, and are no strangers to a cheeky romantic selfie or two shared to social media, as they happily give fans a glimpse into their relationship.</p>
      <p>Sam has since noted that his partner seems to be getting a lot of attention from football players recently, as he claims both Brandon and Patrice, who is married to wife Sandra Evra, DMd her on Instagram.</p>

      <p>Taking to his Instagram story, the 27–year-old decided to grill the two over their actions, although no harm was done, as he joked that he has always ‘dreamed’ of talking to footballers, but is only able to do so through his girlfriend’s phone.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve always dreamed of footballers, but no one ever replies to me,’ he begins to say.</p>
      <p>‘The only way I can talk to them is through my girlfriend’s phones on the DMs.’</p>

      <p>As he shows the audience the messages that the Man Utd players had sent, he congratulates Brandon on his recent debut to the team.</p>
      <p>‘We’ve got Brandon Williams today who is actually sick and got his debut, congratulations Brandon,’ he continues. ‘Little eye emoji, yes boy. Love that, classic stuff.</p>
      <p>‘We’ve got Patrice Evra on there who’s like a hero of mine and who I absolutely love. He’s sent of one of those things where he says, “I love this game.”</p>
      <p>‘Why don’t they reply to me, but slide into her DMs? I’m just as good.’</p>
      <p>The reality star then makes a plea for players of Chelsea Football Club to get in contact – a club much closer to his home.</p>
      <p>‘It’s always Man United, but where are the Chelsea boys?’ he questions. ‘Mason Mount, slide in. Or Tammy Abraham, you’re my hero, come on.’</p>
