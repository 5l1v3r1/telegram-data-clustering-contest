      <p>Two major players in the rural real estate industry have announced a partnership they say will deliver benefits for both customers and shareholders.</p>
      <p>Farmlands Real Estate and Property Brokers have combined to establish a specialised, nationwide real estate and property management service with aspirations to lead the provincial realty market.</p>
      <p>Property Brokers is one of New Zealand's most prominent provincial real estate and property management providers, with 45 branches and more than 650 staff nationwide.</p>
      <p>Farmlands Co-operative is New Zealand's largest farmer-owned co-operative.</p>
      <p>Under the partnership, Property Brokers now owns and manages the day-to-day real estate business created from the agreement.</p>
      <p>Farmlands Co-operative will continue to support real estate through its extensive network, events, customer loyalty programme and shareholder discounts.</p>
      <p>The long-term strategic partnership will provide a broader footprint, increased scale, more resources and improved service for customers, including Farmlands' 70,000 shareholders and Property Brokers' provincial client base.</p>
      <p>Under the new partnership, the co-operative retains its investment in real estate and will receive a contribution on future sales.</p>
      <p>Farmlands' farmer-grower shareholders still receive special real estate offers as part of their co-operative ownership model - including an exclusive discount on commission and Choices Rewards Points (the co-operative's customer loyalty scheme).</p>
      <p>A large store network has been created, with existing Property Brokers sites throughout New Zealand being supplemented by most of the co-operative's real estate offices.</p>
      <p>The combination of breadth and depth is something both company CEOs are excited about.</p>
      <p>"Farmlands Co-operative has a strong network, highly regarded brand and expert knowledge of the rural sector. Property Brokers is a business that solely focuses on real estate - we know and understand provincial property and real estate agents," said Property Brokers general manager Conrad Wilkshire.</p>
      <p>"We are a growing business, and our real estate track record is backed up with strong training, systems and marketing support."</p>
      <p>Chairman of Property Brokers, Tim Mordaunt, said the new partnership would give the pair 20 percent share of the rural property market.</p>
      <p>"Farmlands is one of the largest players in rural New Zealand. Bringing Farmlands and Property Brokers together, with a network of offices, scaled-up infrastructure and a focused realty business is very exciting," he said.</p>
      <p>"Together, we aspire to grow our market share considerably."</p>
      <p>Farmlands chief executive Peter Reidie said the partnership between the co-operative's real estate arm and Property Brokers was a great result for shareholders.</p>
      <p>"We are an ambitious business and to achieve the size and scale we want for our shareholders, we have partnered with a nationwide brand that has a proven track record in this highly specialised service," he said.</p>
      <p>"More customers up and down the country will now have access to specialist rural, lifestyle and residential real estate services and property management*."</p>
      <p>That partnership reach will take Property Brokers to over 700 staff across 64 locations, from Kaitaia to Invercargill.*</p>
      <p>"Together, we can grow this business on a scale we could not achieve on our own," said Reidie.</p>
      <p>* Farmlands will continue to administer its property management portfolio and its West Coast real estate sites, pending Commerce Commission clearance.</p>
