      <h1>Bambam announces pregnancy — a week after white wedding</h1>

        <b>Bamike ‘Bambam’ Olawunmi, former housemate of the 2018 season of the Big Brother Naija (BBNaija) reality television, has announced that she is expecting her first child.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The announcement comes barely a week after she <a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/watch-videos-from-teddy-a-bambams-white-wedding-in-dubai/"><b>had her white wedding</b></a> with Tope ‘Teddy A’ Adenibuyan, her fellow housemate, in Dubai.</p>
      <p>The talented reality star took to her Instagram page to share the good news to her over one million fans.</p>
      <p>Clad in a dazzling white rope and flaunting a stunning pose, Bambam, who seems to be developing a protruded tummy, which is suggestive she could actually be pregnant, seems to be addressing her unborn baby in the post.</p>
      <p>“The little one decided to photobomb my hot shot, seems baby would be as vain as me,” she wrote.</p>

      <p>The couple’s star-studded white wedding, held last week, comes over two months after they had their <a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/teddy-a-bambam-traditional-wedding/"><b>traditional marriage ceremony</b></a> at Ibese, Ilaro in Ogun state — <a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/teddy-a-bambam-ex-bbnaija-housemates-announce-engagement/"><b>following their engagement.</b></a></p>
      <p>Their long-standing relationship started during the third edition of the reality TV show and ever since they left the house, the duo have not shown signs of breaking that emotional bond.</p>
      <p>In a previous <a href="https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/teddy-a-women-bambam-bbnaija/"><b>chat with TheCable Lifestyle</b></a>, Teddy A had revealed why it was easy for him to connect with Bambam back then in the house.</p>
