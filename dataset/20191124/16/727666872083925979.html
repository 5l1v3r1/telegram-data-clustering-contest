      <p>Atlanta rap star 21 Savage paid it forward by talking to Atlanta students about avoiding the street life.</p>

      <p>"Lot of struggles in my life, I've dealt with a lot of the same things you are going through today," <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/community/21-savage-guns-down-heads-up/85-a238e20a-041d-49d6-82b2-2c318028383e">21 Savage told the students.</a> "Stay out of the way, do the right thing. It's a sense of calm and it can change your life."</p>
      <p>Despite being a superstar rapper, 21 Savage, real name Sh√©yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, is still facing serious legal problems of his own.</p>
