      <h1>Conway: Bloomberg entry shows 'Democratic field is underwhelming'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:11:25+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/zack-budryk" target="_blank">Zack Budryk</a></address>
      <p>Counselor to the President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/kellyanne-conwaya">Kellyanne Conway</a> Sunday said the entry of former New York City Mayor <a href="https://thehill.com/people/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> into the 2020 presidential race demonstrated that "the Democratic field is underwhelming."</p>
      <p>Bloomberg’s entry, Conway said on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” was the former mayor’s way of saying “I don’t think any of you can beat <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>,” but decried his first campaign ad, saying it was “all unicorns and rainbows” and comparing it to Obama’s campaign, adding “as we sit here today over 10 million have no health insurance of any kind.”</p>
      <p>The billionaire announced his entry into the race on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“America already elected a builder,” Conway said, adding that she “wish[ed] Bloomberg would be mayor of New York City again.”</p>
      <p>Conway demurred when asked by CBS’ Margaret Brennan why Trump had continued to promote conspiracy theories about Ukraine being responsible for the hack of the Democratic National Committee’s server, instead saying that Trump’s attitude on his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was that after <a href="https://thehill.com/people/robert-mueller">Robert Mueller</a>’s investigation, “the president looks at it as, it’s his turn, he wants to get to the bottom of what happened in 2016.”</p>
      <p>Conway also cited declining public support for impeachment, saying numerous Democrats who represent districts that voted for Trump “have to go back home and say ‘I know I promised to lower your drug prices, I know I promised to keep the great economy going… but we’re impeaching the president.’”</p>
