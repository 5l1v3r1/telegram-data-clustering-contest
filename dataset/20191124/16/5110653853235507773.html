      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:25:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:25</time> by <a rel="author">Tadd Haislop</a></address>
      <p>Playing through pain had never been an issue for Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford until team doctors told him it was. The 31-year-old passer had started 136 regular-season games for Detroit before he was ruled out for the team's Week 10 game in Chicago.</p>
      <p>The reasons, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28048473/source-lions-qb-matthew-stafford-broken-bones-back">according to ESPN</a>, werefractured bones in Stafford's back, an injury that reportedly dates back to last year. The pain intensified through the 2019 season to the point where Stafford was told he should not play.</p>
      <p>Stafford, who has three seasons left on <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/detroit-lions/matthew-stafford-6078/">his current contract</a> beyond 2019, had not missed a start for the Lions since 2010. While he's out with an injury the team is calling week-to-week, Detroit is playing Jeff Driskel at QB. Before his injury, Stafford was maintaining career-highs in passer rating (106.0) and QBR (73.1) this season.</p>
      <p>Below is all you need to know about Stafford's injury, including a timeline of his injury updates and when the Lions might get him back in the lineup.</p>
      <h3>How long will Matthew Stafford be out?</h3>
      <p>According to ESPN, the initial word on Stafford's injury was it couldkeep him out one week"or three weeks." We've reached three weeks, and NFL Media <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001077217/article/lions-matthew-stafford-could-miss-a-month-and-a-half">reported</a>last week that the Lions QB "could miss up to a month and a half."</p>
      <p>Stafford, who was ruled out for Detroit's Week 12 game in Washington, wants to play again this season despite the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28149632/sources-lions-discuss-shutting-matthew-stafford-qb-hopes-return-season">team reportedly having discussed</a> shutting him down for the rest of the year.</p>
      <p>After the Redskins game in Week 12, the Lions in Week 13 are scheduled to play their annual Thanksgiving day game, this year at home against the Bears. They'll get a mini-bye after that Chicago game before they play the Vikings in Minnesota in Week 14.</p>
      <p>Shortly after Stafford's status for the Week 10 Bears game was announced, Stafford's wife Kelly <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1193541987993096192">wrote</a> in an Instagram post, "I'm happy his body will get a little healing time."</p>
      <h3>What is Matthew Stafford's injury?</h3>
      <p>According to multiple reports, Stafford has fractured bones in his back. It's unclear when the injury initially occurred, but according to ESPN, it "dates back to last season, when he played through the pain and didn't miss a game, even though those around him knew how much he was suffering."</p>
      <p>Stafford <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001074686/article/matthew-stafford-backhip-out-vs-bears-jeff-driskel-to-start">also is dealing with a hip injury</a>, according to NFL Media.</p>
      <p>On the Saturday night before the Chicago game in Week 10, ESPN reported Stafford <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1193409444010438656">was being told not to play</a> due to the back injury. He had been listed as questionable on the injury report and was practicing through the week while hoping to play through the pain.</p>
      <p>The next morning, Stafford evidently gave in to doctors' suggestions to get further testing done on his back. He had an MRI a couple days before the Bears game, per NFL Media,</p>
      <h3>Matthew Stafford injury timeline</h3>
      <p>Stafford had been playing through pain in his back all season thanks to an injury that reportedly bothered him last year, too.</p>
      <p>Before he was ruled out for the Chicago game in Week 10, Stafford had been listed as questionable on Detroit's injury report five times dating back to last season. According to ESPN, he nearly missed the Lions' home game against the Chiefs in Week 4 due to the pain in his back.</p>
      <p>NFL Media noted that a big hit Stafford took in the Lions' Week 9 loss to the Raiders could have been the shot that made him unable to keep playing through the injury. Yet in the week leading up to the Bears game, Stafford was practicing through the pain and telling reporters he was fine.</p>
      <p>"I'll be good to go," Stafford said that Wednesday. "I'm not really worried about it. Something different, but I'm totally good." (He wasn't.)</p>
      <p>That Saturday, ESPN reported Stafford was being told not to play against the Bears, but he was hoping to play through the pain like always. On themorning of the game, multiple reports indicated Stafford would be inactive in Chicago.</p>
      <p>ESPN reported Stafford's injury would keep him sidelined up to three weeks, though he was being considered week-to-week.</p>
