      <h1>Hilary Duff Had This Cryptic Response About Miranda Returning to Lizzie McGuire</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:09:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:09</time> by <a rel="author">Hilary Weaver</a></address>
      <p>Lizzie's back. Disney+ <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a28804968/hilary-duff-lizzie-mcguire-reboot-details/">has resurrected</a> the early aughts favorite <i>Lizzie McGuire</i>, much to the delight of every past fan who is now rapidly approaching 30. Hilary Duff, the show's star, has been pretty candid about posting Lizzie updates as she and the rest of the cast have started filming. When <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/23/hilary-duff-miranda-return-lalaine-lizzie-mcguire-reboot-gordo/">TMZ approached her on the street</a>—with her young daughter in tow—she seemed comfortable to answer a few questions.</p>
      <p>As she wrangled her 1-year-old, Banks, Duff politely answered a few questions about the reboot. But when the man behind the camera asked if there was "anybody else that you hope to come back," Duff just responded, "I can't tell you that!" Then, smiling, she walked into a store with Banks in her arms—likely to avoid having to skirt around any other details.</p>
      <p>It was clear that TMZ was curious if Lalaine Vergara-Paras, who played half of Lizzie's best-friend group, Miranda, would be joining the team. Curiosity is spiking as Duff continues to create social media excitement with Adam Lamberg, who plays Gordo.</p>

      <p>"Gordo was an essential piece of the puzzle to what made the original <i>Lizzie McGuire</i> so authentic and beloved," Hilary Duff said in a statement. "I couldn't imagine the series without him. I can't wait for fans to see what he's up to 15 years later and how he fits into Lizzie's adult world."</p>
      <p>After Disney+ posted this video on Twitter, teasing adult Lizzie and Gordo's friendship, real fans are surely wondering if the trio will be return. For now, it's pretty obvious that Duff is not talking.</p>
