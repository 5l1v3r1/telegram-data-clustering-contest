      <h1>Pope Francis rides in carbon-free popemobile in Japan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:36:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/ap" target="_blank">AP</a></address>
      <p>Pope Francis rode in a carbon-free popemobile at his Mass in Nagasaki, an appropriate choice in line with his environmental concerns.</p>
      <p>Organisers say Francis used a Toyota hydrogen-powered Mirai, customised with a stand and handrails. He will use a similar model while in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>The pope held a big Mass at a Nagasaki city baseball stadium. Earlier Sunday, he demanded world leaders renounce atomic weapons and the Cold War-era doctrine of deterrence and paid respects at a memorial for the 26 martyrs.</p>
      <p>Environmental protection is one of Francis' key agenda items and is also part of the theme of his Japan visit.</p>
