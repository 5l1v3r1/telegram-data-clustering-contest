      <h1>This One Battle Proved Why General George Patton Is a Legend</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Warfare History Network</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point:</b> Patton's leadership made the Third Army highly motivated and deadly.</p>
      <p>Lieutenant General George Patton’s Third Army had come a long way since it was activated on August 1 in Normandy. Following the breakout from Normandy in late July, Patton’s army had swept 400 miles in one month’s time all across central France to the Lorraine region, where it was met by General der Panzertruppen Otto Knobelsdorff’s First Army, which was determined to defend the Moselle line.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the XII Corps under Maj. Gen. Manton Eddy on Patton’s right, or southern, wing, was able to cross the Moselle and concentrate at Arracourt, while his other corps, the XX Corps, under Maj. Gen. Walton Walker, aimed directly for Metz.</p>
      <p>Reinforced by General der Panzertruppen Hasso von Manteuffel’s 5th Panzer Army in the middle of the month, Knobelsdorff’s First Army was in a position to launch a major counterattack against Eddy’s XII Corps bridgehead. A surprise attack against Eddy’s right flank at Lunéville on September 18 marked the beginning of a protracted 11-day tank battle in which German forces tried unsuccessfully to isolate and destroy Eddy’s bridgehead on the east bank of the Moselle.</p>
      <p>Throughout the course of the <a href="http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/wwii/first-day-at-arracourt-pattons-third-army-vs-monteuffels-panzers/">Battle of Arracourt</a>, the Germans were constantly forced to scale back their objectives when the Americans successfully parried one blow after another. During the fighting, Maj. Gen. John Wood’s 4th Armored Division––dubbed “Patton’s Best” by its members and “Roosevelt’s Butchers” by the enemy––was able to inflict heavy losses on German panzer units.</p>
      <p>The fighting fizzled out when German Führer Adolf Hitler transferred Manteuffel’s Fifth Army north at the end of the month to counter the Allies’ moves against the West Wall, as well as part of preparations for a planned winter attack through the Ardennes.</p>
