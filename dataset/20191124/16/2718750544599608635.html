      <p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/watch-alec-baldwin-will-ferrell-snl-cold-open-video.html">Will Ferrell</a> is now an esteemed member of <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/11/snl-maya-rudolph-kamala-harris-democratic-debate-watch.html"><i>SNL</i>’s</a> Five-Timers Club (and, you know, VIP cast member for life), and yet that didn’t stop him from spiraling into a fan-crazed abyss at the mere sight of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/ryan-reynolds-hobbs-and-shaw-cameo-how-it-happened.html">Ryan Reynolds</a> during his opening monologue. Yes, that’s Ryan Reynolds in the audience. <i>The </i>Ryan Reynolds. Mr. Blake Lively. The <i>Deadpool </i>guy. All Ferrell wants to do is make him laugh after confirming he’s definitely, 100 percent the Canadian actor who starred in <i>The Proposal, </i>and his “terrible” monologue can take a backseat so he can do some sucking up instead. Can’t say we blame him.</p>
