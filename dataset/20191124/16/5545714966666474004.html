      <p>The prevailing theme in October is usually horror games due to the strong influence of Halloween on pop culture. In keeping with Destructoid's annual tradition of blog writing in October, the theme is related to scary games. Just as this year’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../bloggers-wanted-hello-darkness--567622.phtml">"Hello Darkness"</a> prompt suggested, it revolves around games that solicit feelings of dread and horror. However, are games of this genre the only games that solicit these types of feelings?</p>
      <p>If you think about it, scary games are designed to be one thing above all, and that is to be as uncomfortable for the player as possible, while at the same time providing enough room for the players to willingly delve deep into the non-comfort zone.</p>
      <p>It is clear that horror games are not the only games that can extract you from your comfort zone. Many games of different genres attempt their best to simultaneously upset and cajole the player to invoke alternate feelings of frustration and helplessness, while also providing moments of pure joy and victory. Some games, like <i>Papers Please</i>, don’t provide the slightest form of joy or release.<br/><br/>But outside of challenging games - which is a form of discomfort that is pivotal to gameplay to a certain degree - there are also those games that aim to harass the player in unique and inventive ways.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The survival genre is built on the concepts of scarcity and continuous maintenance. The idea that resources must be scavenged to be consumed regularly, and that there may be a possible shortage that leads to failure. Note that the possibility of shortage may simply be suggested and could be a very remote possibility, but it will affect how the player reacts to the game.</p>
      <p>This concept is brilliantly used in a game I am playing now, <i>The Banner Saga</i>. In this game, you oversee a caravan of warriors for most of the time. This caravan consumes resources that deplete with each passing day. Resources can be bought using experience points that can also be used to buy items and upgrade characters as well. These scarce resources force you to juggle three different priorities, creating a situation where the player must debate within themselves.</p>
      <p>When an event happens that mentions half the supplies could be poisoned, you must balance the risks of that being true vs. the risk that poisoned supplies would kill off some of your warriors. There is a distinct possibility that none of this could matter. You might have more than enough supplies. However, until you know for sure, the illusion of scarcity raises the stakes so much that you become more invested in the game.</p>
      <p>Other games aim to be emotionally, morally, or even viscerally uncomfortable. Sometimes, games try to transmit these feelings through the gameplay itself. Adding layers that cause tensions, difficulty, discomfort, or any other negative feeling. Often, this is where receptions can widely vary.</p>
      <p>For instance, the animal character in <i>The Last Guardian </i>was designed to ignore the player in the early game, becoming more responsive as trust is built between the two. This is the feeling I got from the game, and one I think was true to its message and concept. However, some people found that degree of unresponsiveness annoying, and they didn’t appreciate this relationship between story concepts and gameplay.</p>

        <i>
          <b>
            <sub>I found the way the boy's relationship with Trico developed to be organic, others found it confusing and tedious.</sub>
          </b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>This is usually where developers need to be careful to differentiate between being difficult or uncomfortable and being plain tedious. As with many horror games, you usually fail if you scare players away from playing your game. You want to be scary, but also provide enough hope so that the player want to progress.</p>
      <p>Recently, Hideo Kojima’s <i>Death Stranding </i>was released to mixed reviews, despite its respectable 84 Metacritic score, where even reviewers who gave it high scores used adjectives such as "boring," "tedious," or "pretentious" to describe its gameplay and story. Since I haven't played the game, I will not attempt to make any statements about the game itself, but rather its reception.</p>
      <p>I think similar to how <i>The Last Guardian </i>was received, not all players will engage with <i>Death Stranding’s </i>gameplay with the way some of the reviewers (or even Kojima himself) wished them to. How someone can receive a game and interact with it is difficult to control (which is why some games opt for over-long tutorials that ensure the players know how to best play the game).</p>
      <p>In the end, games that aim to discomfort, horrify, or otherwise upend the established norms all face an uphill battle. By definition, their attempts could fall flat, be too successful and off-putting, or simply become tedious to go through.</p>
      <p>It's a tight balancing act, and I don’t think you can include every demographic in that balance easily, but I think games that push the envelope make gaming more interesting as a whole, even if I end up being bored to tears playing <i>Death Stranding </i>three years from now.</p>
