      <p>You’ll be hard pressed to find a more-passionate television analyst than Michael Irvin these days. The former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver loves football and he <i>really </i>loves his former team.</p>
      <p>Irvin had a special message for the Cowboys ahead of this afternoon’s game against the Patriots.</p>
      <p>“I want my young Dallas Cowboys to know, those young Davids to know this giant that sits before you today, he is not for your destruction, it is for your construction,” Irvin said.</p>
      <p>“SLAY. THIS. GIANT.”</p>
      <p>You can watch his full rant below:</p>

      <p>That should get everyone fired up ahead of today’s NFL slate.</p>

      <p>The game will be on FOX.</p>
