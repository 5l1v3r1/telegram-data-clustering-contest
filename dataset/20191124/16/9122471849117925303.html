      <h1>ESPN Releases Prediction For Nebraska-Iowa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:48:28+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Two storied Big Ten West programs collide in Rivalry Week when Iowa takes on Nebraska at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln. But while one team hopes to secure a New Year’s Six berth, the other just hopes to be playing come bowl season.</p>
      <p>The Hawkeyes have somewhat quietly been putting together yet another stellar season with Kirk Ferentz at the helm. After beating then-unbeaten Minnesota last week, Iowa avoided a letdown this week with 19-10 win over a solid Illinois team. Considering that their only losses have been to ranked teams, the Hawkeyes have proven about as tough as they come.</p>
      <p>The Huskers are coming off easily their strongest win of the season (which isn’t saying much unfortunately) following a 54-7 thrashing of hapless Maryland on the East Coast. They’re 5-6 on the season, already exceeding their win total of the last two seasons, but need this win to get bowl-eligible.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=401112200">ESPN’s computer model</a> has released its prediction for the Nebraska-Iowa game.</p>
      <h3>ESPN’s computer model believes that Iowa is the most likely winner. The computer model gives the Hawkeyes a 70.5 percent chance to win this Saturday’s game.</h3>
      <p>Iowa is currently on a four-game winning streak against Nebraska, and has three straight wins at Memorial Stadium.</p>
      <p>With such talented opposition, Scott Frost will need to put all of his money where his mouth is to get that coveted sixth win.</p>
      <p>The game will be played at 2:30 p.m. EST on BTN.</p>
