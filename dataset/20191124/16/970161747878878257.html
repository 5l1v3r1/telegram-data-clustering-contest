      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> manager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> says he has favoured the experience of Phil Jones in picking his line-up to face Sheffield United on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old is making his first <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> appearance of the season in the trip to Bramall Lane, with Solskjaer appearing to have matched up with Chris Wilder’s back three formation.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian coach was coy when asked if he was playing with three defenders, suggesting Jones could step up into midfield, while he says Axel Tuanzebe was not quite fit enough.</p>

      <p>‘We know about Sheffield United’s strengths and we’ve got to defend well. Obviously set plays in the box, stop crosses,’ explained Solskjaer to <i>Sky Sports</i> before kick-off.</p>
      <p>‘We know tactically we have to be spot-on and of course mentally, because this ground is not an easy one if you don’t get a good start.</p>

      <p>‘So Jones comes in with the experience. He’s been fit now for a while and been training hard and well, so he will give us a good option in two positions.’</p>
      <p>Probed on whether he would be in midfield or defence, Solskjaer smiled and replied: ‘He might do midfield for a little while, he might do at the back – it depends on how the game goes.’</p>
      <p>On Tuanzebe, he added: ‘Axel’s back in the squad, not really ready to play yet.’</p>

      <p>Expanding on the decision to <i>MUTV</i>: ‘Phil has been training well. He’s got experience of playing both central midfield and at the back.</p>
      <p>‘When you show the attitude he’s shown in training, it’s time for him to get a chance. Marcos [Rojo] is injured, Axel isn’t really ready to come in so it was an easy option.’</p>
