      <h1>Emmerdale fans spot 'proof' paedo Maya is NOT having Jacob's baby</h1>
      <h2>There's been a bit of blunder</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:23:03+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:23</time> by <a rel="author">Entertainment Daily</a></address>
      <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> reckon they may have spotted proof that Maya Stepney <i>isn't</i> having Jacob Gallagher's baby.</p>
      <p>Fans were shocked last week as the paedophile teacher was released from prison early - and very visibly pregnant.</p>
      <p>Now they have pointed out that Maya must know who the father of her baby is and how it won't be Jacob Gallagher - because the baby would be proof she abused him and would send her back to prison.</p>
      <p>One said: "I think that, at the time of the trial, Jacob maintained that sex had not taken place, so Maya got a light sentence, just found guilty of grooming a pupil.</p>

      <p>"If the baby is Jacob's, that will be a different offence and she will go back to prison."</p>
      <p>A second said: "Let's just ignore the fact that a baby would be proof she slept with Jacob and get her sent right back to jail, for a much longer spell. #Emmerdale"</p>
      <aside>A baby would be proof she slept with Jacob.</aside>
      <p>A third said: "Agreed. Maya wouldn't risk that."</p>
      <p>Other fans were left disappointed by the twist claiming it was sensationalising what should have been a serious storyline.</p>

      <p>One said: "Maya is pregnant!! Wow, #Emmerdale really likes to link the abuser to their victims. It's disgusting."</p>
      <p>A second said: "What is it with the producers of Emmerdale, they can't get anything right.</p>
      <p>"First Maya is pregnant now Luke and Wendy are there when Vic goes into labour, her rapist's family?</p>
      <p>"Do these producers have any experience at producing a show it's like amateur hourðŸ™„."</p>
      <p>A third said: "Wait... Maya is pregnant? Another pregnancy that is a result from rape? Sigh...#Emmerdale."</p>
      <p>Another added: "Just when i thought #Emmerdale couldn't sink any lower... Maya is pregnant ðŸ™„ðŸ”«."</p>
