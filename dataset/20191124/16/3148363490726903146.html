      <p>On Sunday’s broadcast of NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) said House Democrats wanted the so-called whistleblower to testify until President Donald Trump’s comments.</p>
      <p>Schiff said, “We had a deep interest in having the whistleblower testify until two things happened. One, we were able to prove everything in the whistleblower complaint with witnesses that had first-hand information.”</p>
      <p>He continued, “Second, the president and his allies effectively put the whistleblower’s life in danger. The president said the whistleblower and others should be treated as a traitor or a spy, and we ought to use the penally we used to use for traitors and spies, and that is the death penalty.”</p>
      <p>He added, “We don’t need the whistleblower’s secondhand evidence anymore. It would only serve to endanger this person and gratify the president’s desire for retribution. That is not a good enough will-be reason to bring in the whistleblower.”</p>
