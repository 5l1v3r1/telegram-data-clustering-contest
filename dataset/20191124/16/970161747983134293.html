        <b>Michael van Gerwen has labelled Mervyn King ‘bad for darts’ after beating the Englishman in a bad-tempered contest at the Players Championship Finals.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Neither were at their best in the quarter-final match, but MVG was able to get over the line with a 10-6 win, averaging just 92.15.</p>
      <p>King has been playing through serious back pain throughout the event, and it was clearly bothering him in the contest with the world champion, although MVG felt he was milking it somewhat.</p>
      <p>In fact, Van Gerwen thinks that King complains so much during games that he has become bad for the sport.</p>
      <p>‘Mervyn didn’t want to make it a game, he was complaining about everything, the wind, the dartboard, but I had the same,’ Van Gerwen told ITV. ‘Merv was the old Merv.</p>
      <p>‘People like him are bad for darts. Normally I don’t say that, but if you are that injured on your back, why would you play? Simple.</p>

      <p>‘Of course, if people keep complaining…we’re all here to do a job, try to win the game with a good performance.</p>
      <p>‘The way he keeps making excuses, what Mervyn is like, we all know that, that’s not nice, it doesn’t do the game any favours.’</p>

      <p>Van Gerwen may have gone on to win the game, but he says that King’s complaints were causing him to under-perform.</p>
      <p>‘People that know me, they know it put me off. I don’t want to win games like this,’ continued the Dutchman.</p>
      <p>‘People like him, it’s not good. It wasn’t really a battle, just a battle against myself. I was really annoyed, I’m still annoyed.</p>
      <p>‘I want to play nice games, with a great battle. If I lose I lose, if I win I win, but not like that with silly excuses.</p>
      <p>‘I have to look at the positives because you always learn, it’s not always easy, I need to keep in mind that I won the game but I want to show everything that I’m capable of.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t like games like this.’</p>

      <p>This is not the first time these two have had a run-in, with Van Gerwen describing King as a ‘disgrace for darts’ after a ProTour match in February.</p>
      <p>King played poorly in a 7-3 defeat to the world number one, and MVG accused him of not trying.</p>
      <p>‘He was not even trying [to beat me]. A disgrace for darts,’ said Van Gerwen. ‘Things like this should not happen in darts. I always give hundred percent. No one can ever judge me on that.</p>
      <p>‘If people want to beat me, then they need to push me. For the rest, I don’t care.’</p>
      <p>Mighty Mike referenced the incident again in October ahead of their Grand Prix quarter-final, saying: ‘Yeah but he did [give up]. Prove me otherwise.</p>
      <p>‘If people talk about it I don’t mind, and if people say it’s not true, prove me otherwise.’</p>
