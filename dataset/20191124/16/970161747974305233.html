      <p>Gary Neville has warned <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> players that they could be in for a difficult test in front of a raucous Sheffield United crowd.</p>
      <p>The Blades have been hugely impressive since their promotion into the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> and sit eighth in the table, two places above the Red Devils after 12 games.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s side have bounced back from a dismal run of form to win five of their last six matches in all competitions, but their struggles on the road will give Sheffield United confidence on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Speaking on <i>Sky Sports</i>, Neville revealed that he’d received some stick from Sheffield United fans before kick-off and predicted that his former club could be in for a tough afternoon at Bramall Lane.</p>

      <p>‘I’ve already been abused about five times outside this ground so it’s going to be hostile as well,’ he said.</p>

      <p>Geoff Shreeves jokingly replies: “That was just by the staff!”</p>
      <p>Neville added: ‘It definitely will be [a tough game for United].</p>
      <p>‘I think it’s incredible that Sheffield United, with very much the same team as last season almost, have performed the way they have in the way in which they have. They’re great defensively.</p>
      <p>‘Man United have been poor away from home, when they concede first they really struggle which tells you where they’re at in terms of their maturity or lack of it as a team.</p>
      <p>‘Manchester United need to score first today to have any chance. I think if they [Sheffield United] get in front the atmosphere will be incredible.’</p>
