      <h1>Watching Tesla Cybertruck’s ‘vault’ bed cover in action is hypnotizing</h1>

      <p>The Tesla Cybertruck’s design is so bold and unapologetically sci-fi that a lot of its clever features ended up being swept under the rug following the vehicle’s unveiling. Yet beyond its origami-style design and its Syd Mead-inspired looks, the Cybertruck is chock-full of innovative features. Take its Vault’s motorized tonneau bed cover, for example, which is downright hypnotizing to watch. </p>
      <p>It’s pretty amusing to note that following the Cybertruck’s unveiling, critics of the vehicle online argued that the truck was not a real truck at all since it does not have a bed. This is a false assumption of course, since the Cybertruck actually has a <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-daily-range-boosts-solar-panels/">6.5-foot-long bed</a>. It just so happened to be covered by a motorized tonneau cover that, according to the electric car maker, is sturdy enough to stand on. Tesla describes the feature in the vehicle’s page on its official website. </p>
      <p>“With up to 3,500 pounds of payload capacity and adjustable air suspension, Cybertruck is the most powerful tool we have ever built, engineered with 100 cubic feet of exterior, lockable storage — including a magic tonneau cover that is strong enough to stand on,” Tesla wrote. </p>

      <p>Fortunately, Tesla community member <a href="https://twitter.com/MattLondre">M@ttLond.re</a> was able to capture footage of the Cybertruck’s tonneau cover in action from the unveiling event. Based on his video, it could be seen that the cover actually rolls past the rear window and gets stowed away underneath. The entire contraption is activated through a rather discrete button on the rear end of the Cybertruck. Such a system is a rather elegant Tesla-esque solution for such a utility-focused feature. </p>
      <p>The Tesla Cybetruck’s motorized tonneau cover gives several advantages to the vehicle, the most notable of which is aerodynamics. Musk has also hinted at the cover being laid with solar panels, which could give the Cybertruck around 15 miles of range per day. These, together with the cover’s clever stow-away system, shows that a notable amount of thought went into designing the Cybertruck and its functions.</p>
      <p>With the <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-future-of-pickup-design/">motorized tonneau cover</a> engaged, drivers inside the vehicle would not be able to get a clear view of the Cybertruck’s rear using a traditional rearview mirror. To solve this, Tesla has gone ahead and utilized a rear camera in place of a traditional rearview mirror. It’s a very simple solution, and it taps into an already existing system that Tesla has used with its vehicles since the first-generation Model S came out seven years ago. </p>

      <p>The Tesla Cybertruck is not for everyone. That much is sure. Elon Musk has given the internet ample warning in the months leading up to its release, stating several times that the Tesla Pickup Truck will be polarizing. Following the vehicle’s unveiling, Musks’ words have rung true. Yet, even in its polygonal, meme-worthy form, the Cybertruck appears to be <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-cybertruck-disappoints-wall-st-buyer-support-price-function/">gaining a notable number of supporters</a>, even among those <i>outside</i> the Tesla community. </p>
      <p>This could be seen in Elon Musk’s announcement that Tesla has already received 146k orders for the Cybertruck as of Saturday. That’s following an unveiling event that could have gone better, no advertising, overwhelmingly negative and sarcastic coverage from mainstream media, and absolutely no paid advertising. Musk also noted that so far, 42% of the Cybertuck’s reservation holders have opted for the dual-motor variant, 41% have selected the tri-motor setup, and 17% have ordered the vehicle’s $39,990 base version. </p>
      <p>That’s not too bad for such a polarizing vehicle. </p>
