      <p>A senior commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards has urged the country's judiciary to mete out harsh sentences to what he described as "mercenaries" involved in protests against a fuel price hike last week, the judiciary's Mizan news site reported.</p>
      <p>"We caught all the mercenaries who openly confessed they were doing mercenary work for America and, God willing, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/iran/hard-line-iranian-newspaper-reports-protesters-face-execution-1.8151891">the judicial system of the country will give them maximum punishments</a>," Rear Admiral Ali Fadavi, a deputy Guards commander, was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/iran/iran-warns-regional-states-of-consequences-if-they-stoked-unrest-1.8165607">Iran has blamed "thugs" linked to exiles and foreign foes</a> - the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia - for stirring up unrest which has led to some of the worst violence in a decade.</p>
      <p>Fadavi said several people were killed after being shot at from behind with a handgun from a close distance during the protests, which he said indicated the shooters were among the crowds.</p>
