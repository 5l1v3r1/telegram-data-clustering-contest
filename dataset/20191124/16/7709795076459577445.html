        <figcaption>Sheffield United celebrate George Baldock's goal at Tottenham</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Sheffield United have already taken points from Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea and were so close to getting something against Liverpool, so they will be confident for the visit of Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Chris Wilder's side return from the international break hoping to extend their unbeaten run to six matches (two wins, three draws), against a Red Devils side who have won just four of their last 11 in the Premier League. They have, though, won five of their last six in all competitions and the timing of the break was not at all ideal.</p>
      <p>The Blades have been a breath of fresh air in the top flight this term and look good value to get something on home turf.</p>
      <p>They have shown that they're tactically astute, not afraid to dig in and are rarely phased against big-name opposition. Teams can often return from the internationals in sluggish fashion and United's group of internationals could be vulnerable in South Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>There is definite value in backing the hosts in the +1 handicap market, but the preference is to go with at least two home goals at over 2/1.</p>
      <p>They have only failed to score in three of 11 games this term, scoring two or more on just three occasions, but a couple may well be needed here against a leaky United defence who have conceded at least once in each of their last 11 on the road.</p>
      <p>Sheffield United have a good defensive record, with only Leicester conceding fewer goals than them this term and they have incredibly gone 60 matches in all competitions since last losing by more than one goal.</p>
      <p>This one should be close though and if either side wins, it could be narrow so the 13/10 price on the winning margin to be just one goal is appealing.</p>
      <p>That run of Wilder's will, of course, come to an end eventually and this market allows for a close victory for either side.</p>

        <figcaption>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: Manchester United boss talks to the press</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>After beating Man Utd 2-1 on the first ever day in Premier League history in August 1992, Sheffield United have lost each of their last five against the Red Devils in the top-flight.</li>
        <li>In all competitions, Manchester United have won their last seven meetings with Sheffield United, by an aggregate score of 14-1.</li>
        <li>Sheffield United vs Manchester United is famous as being the fixture to produce the first ever Premier League goal â€“ with Brian Deane netting for the Blades after five minutes in their meeting on 15th August 1992.</li>
        <li>Since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club, Manchester United have lost six of their 19 away Premier League games against promoted sides (W11 D2 L6) â€“ just one fewer than they did in 62 such games with the Scotsman in charge (W36 D19 L7).</li>
        <li>Sheffield United are unbeaten in their last five Premier League games (W2 D3), winning both home matches in that run. The Blades are looking to win three consecutive top-flight home games for the first time since August 1993.</li>
        <li>Manchester United have won just one of their last 10 Premier League away games (D3 L6), and have conceded at least once in each of their last 11 on the road. The Red Devils havenâ€™t failed to keep a clean sheet in 12 consecutive top-flight away games since a run of 15 in the 1985-86 campaign.</li>
        <li>Against Brighton last time out, Manchester United fielded the youngest starting XI in the Premier League so far this season (average age of 23y 350d). Indeed, only Bournemouth (25y 88d) have a younger average starting XI across the Premier League this season than Man Utd (25y 103d).</li>
        <li>Sheffield Unitedâ€™s John Lundstram has scored three goals in 12 Premier League appearances this season â€“ as many goals as heâ€™d scored in his previous 55 league matches combined. Lundstramâ€™s three goals this term is the joint-most heâ€™s ever scored in a single English league campaign (also three in 2017-18 and 2015-16).</li>
        <li>All of Manchester Unitedâ€™s Premier League goalscorers this season have been aged 23 and under, with Anthony Martial their oldest scorer so far (23y 326d vs Norwich). Heâ€™s the youngest oldest goalscorer for a club in the competition this season.</li>
        <li>Marcus Rashford has scored five goals in his last five games in all competitions for Man Utd, and is looking to score in three consecutive games for the Red Devils for the first time since September 2017.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Odds correct as of 1300 GMT on 22/11/19</p>
