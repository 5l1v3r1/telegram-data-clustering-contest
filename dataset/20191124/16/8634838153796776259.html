      <p>The Jubilee Senator had on Tuesday, November 19, posted a picture of her late father, <b>Kihika Kimani,</b> celebrating 15 years since his passing.</p>
      <p>"15 yrs later, it’s not a constant, overwhelming, consuming grief, but the little things, within which grief hides, that hit me when I least expect it.</p>
      <p>"I miss your friendship, incredible sense of humour, generosity, love, wisdom, vision and your guidance! I miss you so much dad," she wrote.</p>

      <p>However, a user Gabriel Oguda, who's a columnist for the <i>Daily Nation</i> was on Sunday, November 24, pointed out that her father's political path had its downfalls.</p>
      <p>"Your father was a hateful figure who had no boundaries of decorum," he began. </p>
      <p>He further referenced the senator's owned political alliances disclosing, "You've been so loud with your anti-dynasty talk yet you're a product of a political dynasty - your father at one time even fielding all his eight wives in various political seats. Hypocrite."</p>
      <p>Kihika, on her part, fired back," Eight? Must have included your mother and grandmother."</p>
      <p>The Senator's father, was a Moi-era politician. Susan is one of the 41 children that her father sired. She was his sixth child with his second wife, Alice.</p>
