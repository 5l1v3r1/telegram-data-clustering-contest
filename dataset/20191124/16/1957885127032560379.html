      <h1>Nintendo Switch Lite gets price cut in Black Friday sales</h1>
      <h2>A lighter price tag.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:52:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:52</time> by <a rel="author">Colm Ahern</a></address>
      <p>With Black Friday right around the corner, you're probably scouring the internet for half price goods, but don't turn your nose up at this deal: the Nintendo Switch Lite is available on Amazon for £189.99.</p>
      <p>The handheld launched back in September to much applause, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2019-nintendo-switch-lite-review">Digital Foundry calling the Switch Lite “an absolute triumph”</a>, and many others claiming similar. Before this week most retailers were flogging the smaller Switch for around £200, so if you were thinking about taking the plunge, now might be the time to do it. You'll pay a little extra if you want the Pokémon version, so we recommend spending your cash on a discounted grey, turquoise or yellow model to get one of the better <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-25-nintendo-switch-black-friday-deals-2019">Nintendo Switch Black Friday</a> deals.</p>
