      <h1>Goo Hara is second young K-pop star to die since October</h1>

      <p>Nov. 24 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/K-pop/?tps=1">K-pop</a> icon Goo Hara was found dead at age 28, police in South Korea said Sunday -- less than six weeks after another young female singing star from the Asian nation died.</p>
      <p>An acquaintance discovered the former Kara singer's body in her home in Seoul around 6 p.m., <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20191124002952320?section=national/national">Yonhap News Agency reported</a>. Police and firefighters were notified.</p>
      <p>The police said they are currently looking into the exact cause of and reason for the death, keeping the possibility of suicide in consideration.</p>
      <p>The BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50535937">reported</a> the entertainer was hospitalized in May after a suicide attempt, but had recently been trying to focus on her music and television career.</p>
      <p>She <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5LVadAFvWC/?utm_source=ig_embed">posted</a> on Instagram Saturday a photo of herself in bed with the caption "Good night" written in Korean.</p>

      <p>Goo Hara's agency, Production Ogi, urged Korean media to refrain from speculating regarding her death.</p>
      <p>"Currently, the family members of the deceased, as well as her friends and acquaintances, are going through a tough time from psychological impact and instability," <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/11/goo-haras-agency-requests-fans-and-media-outlets-to-refrain-from-speculation">the agency wrote</a>. "Therefore, we earnestly ask that media outlets and their related personnel, as well as the fans' condolence calls, refrain from spreading rumors or speculative reports."</p>
      <p>Goo was a good friend of <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Choi_Jin/?tps=1">Choi Jin</a>-ri, known as Sulli of girl group f(x), who was found dead in her home in Seongnam by police on Oct. 14 of a suspected suicide.</p>
      <p>Goo shared photo images of herself with 25-year-old Sulli on her Instagram account, saying, "Jin-ri (will be able to) to do as she wishes in the world over there." Jin-ri is Sulli's legal name</p>
      <p>Sulli's death sparked a closer look at her career as a musician and a feminist who was often the target of cruel Internet trolls.</p>
      <p>Mental health experts are worried about copycat suicides. Several anti-cyber bullying bills have been introduced in the National Assembly in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Since Sulli's death, IU's 2012 song "Peach" -- which was reportedly inspired by her friendship with Sulli -- re-emerged at the top of streaming charts.</p>
      <p>K-pop star Kim Jong-hyun died by suicide in 2017.</p>
      <p>"Women are, of course, discriminated against much more partially in Korea than many other countries in the world," Andrew Eungi Kim, a professor of international studies at Korea University, <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/11/07/Suicide-of-K-pop-star-Sulli-puts-spotlight-on-cyberbullying/4371573147309/?upi_ss=%22Kelly+Kasulis%22">told UPI</a> earlier this month. "And bullying matters more, I think, for Korean kids and teenagers than Westerners. You can choose to be alone or different in the U.S. But here, there's a really strong stigma -- being different is something you really fear."</p>
      <p>Goo was an advocate against cyber bullying and spoke candidly about her own battle with depression.</p>
      <p>"Cyber bullying has been affecting Korean society a great deal as people spend more and more time on social media," Min Byeong-cheol, a professor at Hanyang University, told UPI through an interpreter. "The last few years, several celebrities and a number of students have died because of cyber bullying. A middle school student killed herself by jumping from her family's 10th-floor apartment because five of her classmates bullied her in a social media chatroom. This is a serious social issue in Korea.</p>
      <p>Goo launched a solo music career after being a member of the five-member girl group Kara from 2008 to 2015. She appeared in films and on TV shows as well as major fashion events in Japan.</p>
      <p>She released a Japanese single "Midnight Queen" on Nov. 13 and had a concert tour at four Japanese cities from Nov. 14-19.</p>
      <p>Goo was involved in a revenge pornography case with her ex-boyfriend and hairdresser.</p>
      <p>Last year, he threatened to release an intimate video of her in the wake of a breakup in an effort to end her entertainment career. He didn't leak it despite contacting news outlets over the video.</p>
      <p>In August, he received a suspended jail term by a lower court because of the threat and other criminal behavior.</p>
