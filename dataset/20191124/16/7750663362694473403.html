      <h1>Real Madrid team news: Injury, suspension list vs. Paris Saint-Germain</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> will be looking to keep their hopes of finishing top of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/2019-20/group-a.html">Group A</a> alive when they welcome Paris Saint-Germain to the Bernabeu in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/"><b>Champions League</b></a> on Tuesday night.</h2>

      <p>Los Blancos are currently second in the section on seven points, five behind leaders PSG, who recorded a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/champions-league/result/result-di-maria-scores-twice-as-psg-beat-real-madrid_371930.html">3-0 win</a> in the reverse clash in Paris earlier this season.</p>
      <p>Madrid would book their spot in the knockout round with a victory, although they could lose and still advance providing that third-placed Club Brugge do not overcome Galatasaray in the group's other match.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> rounds up Madrid's latest injury and suspension news ahead of Tuesday's European tie in the Spanish capital.</p>
