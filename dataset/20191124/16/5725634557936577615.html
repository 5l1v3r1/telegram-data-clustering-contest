      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Estee Lauder Companies has agreed to acquire the remaining portion of Have &amp; Be at an enterprise value of $1.7 billion.</li>
        <li>Have &amp; Be is a Seoul-based beauty brand with over $500 million in annual sales.</li>
        <li>With the deal, EL is making a major move into Asia. I expect more acquisitions in the future.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Quick Take</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Estée Lauder Companies (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EL">EL</a>) <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/pr/17701799-estee-lauder-companies-acquire-dr-jart">announced</a> it has agreed to acquire the remainder of Have &amp; Be for an undisclosed amount.</p>
      <p>Have &amp; Be operates as a global skin care company, marketing its products under the brands Dr.Jart+ Skincare and Do The Right Thing.</p>
      <p>With the deal, EL is acquiring an existing partner and its first Asia-based beauty brand as management hints at more acquisitions in the region.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Target Company &amp; Market</b>
      </p>
      <p>Seoul, South Korea-based Have &amp; Be was founded in 2005 to manufacture and market its skincare and men’s grooming products under the brands Dr.Jart+ Skincare and Do The Right Thing, respectively.</p>
      <p>Management is headed by Founder and CEO ChinWook Lee.</p>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-global-skin-care-products-market-size-is-projected-to-reach-usd-183-03-billion-by-2025-expanding-at-cagr-of-4-5-300898330.html">market research report</a> by Report Buyer, the global skin care products market is projected to reach $183 billion by 2025.</p>
      <p>This represents a forecast a CAGR of 4.5% between 2019 and 2025.</p>
      <p>The main drivers for this expected growth are the increasing demand for natural, herbal, and organic products that have no adverse effects, primarily due to a rising geriatric population.</p>
      <p>Major vendors that provide skin care products include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>L'Oréal (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LRLCF">OTCPK:LRLCF</a>) (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LRLCY">OTCPK:LRLCY</a>)</li>

        <b>Acquisition Terms and Financial</b>
      </p>
      <p>EL didn’t disclose the acquisition price and terms and didn’t file a form 8-K or provide a change in financial guidance.</p>
      <p>The firm is acquiring the remaining two-thirds of Have &amp; Be that it previously did not own. EL invested in Have &amp; Be in 2015.</p>
      <p>Have &amp; Be’s current enterprise value is estimated to be $1.7 billion and EL said it will fund the deal with debt.</p>
      <p>To that end, perhaps, EL filed an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000110465919066266/tm1922703-3_8k.htm">8-K stating</a> that it has completed offerings of a total of approximately $1.8 billion in senior notes.</p>
      <p>A review of the firm’s most recent published <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000110465919058209/el-20190930x10q815441.htm#CONSOLIDATEDBALANCESHEETS_347144">financial results</a> indicates that as of September 30, 2019, EL had $2.3 billion in cash and equivalents and $10.9 billion in total liabilities, of which $2.9 billion was long-term debt.</p>
      <p>Free cash flow for the three months ended September 30, 2019, was a negative ($295 million).</p>
      <p>In the past 12 months, EL’s stock price has risen 37.0% vs. the U.S. Personal Product industry’s rise of 21.9% and the overall U.S. market’s growth of 16.1%, as the chart and corporate events graphic indicates below:</p>

        <b>Commentary</b>
      </p>
      <p>EL is acquiring the remaining two-thirds of Have &amp; Be according to its original investment agreement as the firm acquires its first Asian beauty company.</p>
      <p>As EL stated in the deal announcement,</p>
      <blockquote>As one of the fastest growing skin care brands globally, Dr. Jart+ is expected to help further strengthen The Estée Lauder Companies’ leadership position in skin care, and will especially help expand the Company’s consumer reach in Asia/Pacific, North America, the United Kingdom and travel retail.</blockquote>
      <p>South Korean beauty brands have demonstrated their influence far beyond the country’s borders and into China, Japan and Asia more broadly.</p>
      <p>The deal, noted as the ‘first acquisition,’ will likely not be EL’s last acquisition in Asia.</p>
      <p>EL is smart to acquire a firm it has already partnered with, reducing any integration risks or the potential for culture clashes.</p>
      <p>With interest rates continuing to move lower, EL funding the deal with debt doesn’t present a short-term financial hardship.</p>
      <p>While EL’s stock may be overvalued at its present level, acquiring Have &amp; Be should be a positive over the longer term as EL pivots to Asia to a more substantial degree.</p>
