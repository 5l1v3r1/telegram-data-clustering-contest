      <h1>New Tua Tagovailoa NFL Draft Rumors Are Swirling</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:04:54+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Tua Tagovailoa is believed to have played his last downs of college football. The Alabama junior quarterback suffered a season-ending hip injury in the Crimson Tide’s win over Mississippi State. It’s widely believed that Tagovailoa will declare for the 2020 NFL Draft, where he’s expected to be a first-round pick.</p>
      <p>According to the latest report from the NFL, though, Tagovailoa has not yet made a decision on his future. He’s believed to be genuinely considering all of his options.</p>
      <p>Among those options: Returning to Alabama for the 2020 season or returning to school for another year just to rehab.</p>
      <p>Of course, the NFL remains very much in play, as well.</p>
      <p>“With Tagovailoa expected to make a full recovery, it’s worth noting he has not yet made a decision about his future, sources say. One consideration is returning to school even if that doesn’t including playing. Another, of course, is entering the draft.</p>
      <p>“If he does, according to five high-ranking executives, Tagovailoa is still expected to be taken in the first round, with all believing he’ll end up in the first half of the round. He may not be the top three pick he was slated to be before the injury, but the fall from the ailment is not expected to be catastrophic—pending the results of his medical evaluations,” <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001079537/article/alabamas-injured-tagovailoa-still-projected-for-1st-round">NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport reported</a>.</p>
      <p>It would be fairly stunning to see Tagovailoa back at Alabama in 2020, but top NFL Draft prospects have made surprising decisions before.</p>

      <p>One ESPN analyst suggested that Tagovailoa should come back for the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>“It pains me to say this, I think Tua has to go back to school,” Emmanuel Acho said. “And it is monetarily speaking, what does Tua have to lose by going back to school? If he gets hurt again, he already has the injury notion that he is injury prone but if he goes back and he plays clean, you are talking about 15-plus million dollars guaranteed … I’m not for college athletes going back typically but in this case, Tua has more to gain by going back.”</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa has time to make his decision. For now, he’s focused on getting healthy and helping his Alabama teammates get a win over Auburn.</p>
