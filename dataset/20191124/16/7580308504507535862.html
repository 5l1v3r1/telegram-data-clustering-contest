      <h1>Foreign national killed as UN vehicle hit in Kabul blast</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:02:23+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:02</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>A foreign national was killed and at least five other people wounded in a grenade attack on a United Nations vehicle in Kabul on Sunday, an Afghan official said.</p>
      <p>The attack happened on a road frequently used by UN traffic shuttling workers between central Kabul and a large UN compound on the outskirts of the capital.</p>
      <p>“At around 6:20 pm (1350 GMT) a grenade was hurled at a UN vehicle,” interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said.</p>
      <p>Aside from the one fatality, Rahimi said five other people — including two Afghan staff — were wounded. The nationalities of the other victims were not released.</p>
      <p>A UN official did not immediately return a message seeking comment, and no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
      <p>The blast comes during what has been a period of relative and uneasy calm in Kabul, where large-scale attacks have dropped over recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The comparative lull followed a blood-stained presidential campaign season that ended with a general election nearly two months ago.</p>
      <p>But Afghans are still waiting for the results of that September 28 poll, with a recount bogged down by various technical difficulties and complaints from main candidates.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Afghans are waiting to see what might happen next in negotiations between the Taliban and the US.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump in September ended those yearlong talks as Taliban violence continued, but on Friday he suggested to US broadcaster Fox News that negotiations could be getting underway again.</p>
