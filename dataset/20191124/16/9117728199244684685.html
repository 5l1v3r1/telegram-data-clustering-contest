        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> has revealed exactly why he no longer uses the number 1 on his Mercedes car. The Brit uses the number 44 on his car, and since 2014 drivers have been allowed to select their driver numbers, while champions have been afforded the chance to use number one.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton used the number one in FP1 of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix last season but he said he "didn't like it all" meaning he reverted to his usual number of 44 for the rest of the weekend.</p>
      <p>"<i>It's not more dangerous now, [but] I'm the second-oldest driver there, believe it or not</i>," Hamilton said when asked about his continued success on the Graham Norton Show.</p>
      <p>"<i>And [there are] these 19, 20-year-olds that have come in, but now, honestly, I don't think [it is more dangerous being champion]</i>.</p>

      <p>"<i>Naturally I think I am a target, but my race number when I was eight years old was 44. Even though I am number one, and I have been for the last couple of years and I should have number one on my car, I keep 44 on there</i>."</p>
