      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:57:27+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:57</time> by <a rel="author">Abdulai Haruna, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 24, GNA - Mr Frank Gogo, CEO of Worldmap Records, has called on young artistes to be patient as efforts are being made to develop and promote their talents.</p>
      <p>He said many people now talk about the success of Stonebwoy but do they also remember how long it took for him to study and emulate his mentor Batman Samini.</p>
      <p>Mr Gogo said this in an interview with the Ghana News Agency.</p>
      <p>He said ‘Worldmap Records’, which started about three years ago, is here to assist young talents in their effort to produce good music and its record now boasts of renowned stars like KK Fosu, Shotkode and Pacy.</p>
      <p>Mr Gogo said many young artistes have come to seek their aid and efforts are being made to finalise agreements adding that they would be selected based on their quality music styles, stage performances and how they carry themselves in public.</p>
      <p>He said the music industry is tough and many radio deejays are unhelpful with their unusual demands and this does not often inure to the benefit of the music producer and the musician.</p>
      <p>Mr Gogo called for investors to come and aid the sector and facilitate efforts being made by many upcoming musicians.</p>
