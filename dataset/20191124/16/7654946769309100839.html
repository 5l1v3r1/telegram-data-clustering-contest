      <p>Prince William was central in axing Prince Andrew from his royal duties and is “not a huge fan” of his Jeffrey Epstein scandal-scarred uncle, according to a report Sunday.</p>
      <p>Andrew, 59, was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/prince-andrew-didnt-step-back-from-royal-duties-queen-elizabeth-fired-him/">fired Wednesday</a> after his mom, Queen Elizabeth II, felt “hoodwinked” by his disastrous BBC interview over his ties to late pedophile Epstein, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/prince-andrew-looks-to-eugenie-and-beatrice-to-take-over-his-royal-duties-t09d2kqsj">according to The Times of London</a>.</p>
      <p>Now sources tell the paper that Prince William was also heavily involved in the decision that also saw the Duke of York <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/prince-andrew-kicked-out-of-buckingham-palace-over-jeffrey-epstein-scandal/">kicked out of his offices at Buckingham Palace.</a></p>
      <p>“William is becoming more and more involved in decisions about the institution [monarchy] and he’s not a huge fan of his uncle Andrew,” a source told The Times of London.</p>
      <p>Another source also told the paper, “William thinks the right thing happened.”</p>
      <p>Sources say the Queen feels “aggrieved” at claims that she gave her go-ahead for Andrew’s interview, and actually feels “hoodwinked” by what he ended up saying, according to the paper.</p>
      <p>“There is no way the Queen and her private secretary wrote a ‘yes’ on a memo that fully explained what was proposed,” a source told The Times.</p>
      <p>“Andrew had a son-to-mother conversation, letting her know that he was planning to address the controversy, but without going into any details.</p>
      <p>“What should have happened was the full palace process, where the interview proposal was placed under all the scrutiny and due diligence that usually takes place.”</p>
      <p>Sources close to the Queen say she is “privately supportive” of Andrew, who was seen riding at Windsor with his mother last week, but “deeply frustrated,” the paper said.</p>
      <p>In fact, she<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/queen-elizabeth-scraps-prince-andrews-lavish-birthday-bash/"> has scrapped plans for a lavish 60th-birthday bash</a> for Andrew, instead planning to mark the Feb. 19 occasion with a small family dinner, according to the paper.</p>
      <p>So far, only Andrew’s ex, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/sarah-ferguson-defends-ex-husband-prince-andrew-calls-him-a-gentleman/">Sarah Ferguson, has defended him</a>, saying she was “deeply supportive and proud of this giant of a principled man.”</p>
