      <p>With December just a week away, it’s time to talk decorations.</p>
      <p>And one woman has created an amazing wreath for just £11.</p>
      <p>It’s heart-shaped and full of festive colour, plus its fake foliage so you can bring it out year after year.</p>
      <p>Laura Wheeler posted her created to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=extreme%20couponing%20and%20bargains%20uk%20laura%20wheeler%20wreath&amp;epa=SEARCH_BOX">Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK Facebook group</a> and people loved the idea.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘Plain heart wreath from home bargains £6 and £5 of things to stick on from Poundland. All stuck down with a glue gun ( also from Poundland) Total cost £11.’</p>
      <p>The glue gun cost £2 with refills costing £2, but it can be used for other projects.</p>
      <p>She shared pictures of the plain topiary grass heart she bought from the budget store and then showed what it looked like after she added all the decorations, including baubles, stars, dried oranges, pine cones and a gold ribbon at the bottom.</p>
