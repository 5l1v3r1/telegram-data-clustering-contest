      <p>Emily Christian: You might recognize this giant sled hat from the cover of Harper's Bazaar. Or maybe you've seen this feather hat, worn by Lady Gaga in Vanity Fair. Or this golden chain mail hood, worn by Lizzo on the cover of Billboard magazine. What does all this fabulous, famous headwear have in common? It's not this season's newest couture. It all comes from this vintage store in New York City. But not just anyone can wander into this shop and find these special pieces. New York Vintage is home to a collection of valuable retail items at its downstairs storefront. But venture upstairs, and you'll find a secret showroom full of priceless treasures. Only this store's A-list clientele are welcome to view what's hiding in the room. Why would celebrities shop here instead of wearing something fresh off the runway? I got a sneak peek into the exclusive second floor with the owner of New York Vintage to find out. I'm here today to figure out what it would be like when a VIP client comes into your store. Does that mean that I get to see upstairs?</p>
      <p>Shannon Hoey: We swoop you upstairs, and we start to have fun.</p>
      <p>Emily: Oh, my gosh, it's stunning in here.</p>
      <p>Shannon: This is it, babe. You've arrived.</p>
      <p>Emily: I feel like I'm in a dream. So, walking around here, I feel like I've seen some of these things, like, on the red carpet. Do I recognize any of this from anywhere?</p>
      <p>Shannon: Absolutely, absolutely. So, we're standing in front of, right now, this rack, no pun intended. [laughs] This is a great piece. This was worn by Cardi B.</p>
      <p>Emily: No way! Really?</p>
      <p>Shannon: I got so many calls.</p>
      <p>Emily: I'm touching it now.</p>
      <p>Shannon: We didn't wash it.</p>
      <p>Emily: Oh, God.</p>
      <p>Shannon: This was worn by Beyoncé.</p>
      <p>Emily: I feel like I could see, like, Miley or, like, Kim K. wearing some of these.</p>
      <p>Shannon: They pay my rent. [laughs] So, this is a '70s Saint Laurent couture. And we did this on Gaga.</p>
      <p>Emily: On Lady Gaga? I don't know if there's any other Gaga that exists. [laughs] Every time you tell me a celebrity's worn something, I'm, like, just touching it. Like, trying to get closer. I'm like, we connect.</p>
      <p>Shannon: This was worn by Lizzo for Billboard magazine.</p>
      <p>Emily: This was worn by Lizzo.</p>
      <p>Shannon: Within, what, like, last week, yeah.</p>
      <p>Emily: This is amazing. Can I put it on my head?</p>
      <p>Shannon: Do it.</p>
      <p>Emily: Really?</p>
      <p>Shannon: Go, what are you waiting for?</p>
      <p>Emily: How do you put it on your head?</p>
      <p>Shannon: You just put it on.</p>
      <p>Emily: Is Lizzo the last one to wear this?</p>
      <p>Shannon: Yes, she is.</p>
      <p>Emily: Me and Lizzo. I feel, like, really bad--- for wearing this. Not just because it's, like, armor, but also because of Lizzo. Me and Kim, same size. Same proportions.</p>
      <p>Shannon: Who wore it better, baby! We deal quite a bit with celebrities. It's a personal aesthetic. It's not pressure from a designer; it's not political. We do receive a lot of referrals, but, basically, it's just, you know, reserved for industry clientele. So, you know, you're a stylist, you're, as I said earlier, a photographer, or it's Vogue, it's W Magazine, you know, my editors, it's costume designers, fashion designers, etc. We do a lot of red carpet. Who was in recently? Adele was in recently.</p>
      <p>Emily: Oh, my gosh. And they're not for sale upstairs?</p>
      <p>Shannon: Well....[laughs] We've sold, we have. But generally, no. The answer to that question is no.</p>
      <p>Emily: So, in order to be sold, it has to be something extra special that they're offering.</p>
      <p>Shannon: Absolutely. [laughs]</p>
      <p>Emily: So, what makes these special pieces so valuable? And why aren't they for sale?</p>
      <p>Shannon: What's upstairs are those rarities that you really can't find anywhere. It's really a museum collection. Designs by long-gone designers, just those really special, you know, one-offs that you can't find anywhere. Mariano Fortuny. Till today, no one knows how this pleating technique was done. This is circa 1910. Charles Frederick Worth, the father of couture. Evening dress with spangled paillettes. Gianni Versace, 1995. All-silk embroidered evening gown, just timeless.</p>
      <p>Emily: Shannon was kind enough to give me the real VIP experience and let me try on some of these exclusive pieces. Including this Mugler dress. This Versace dress. And this Yves Saint Laurent jacket.</p>
      <p>Shannon: What are we doing here... celebrating the art of fashion and vintage and inspiring people to break out of themselves and not to be afraid to put on something that you're not gonna, like, see on the street necessarily every single day. For me, it's the art of fashion and storytelling. So I think that's what separates us.</p>
      <p>Emily: New York Vintage is a neighborhood staple. It makes some of fashion's greatest treasures available to the public. But it also preserves hundreds of years of history in its upper levels. When I put on a piece of priceless designer fashion, I understood why the city's most glamorous VIP shoppers are drawn here. It's a place filled with pieces they can't find anywhere else. And, ultimately, here, you can play a part in fashion history.</p>
