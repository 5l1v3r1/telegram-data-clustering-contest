      <p>Kodi Lee has kept busy since <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/kodi-lee-wins-americas-got-talent-season-14-46640673">winning season 14 of <b>America's Got Talent</b></a>, and his recent <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/lea-michele-christmas-album-details-46637240">duet with Lea Michele</a> has me keeping an eye out for the nearest golden buzzer.</p>
      <p>Lee, who is blind and has autism, showed up to perform at the Autism Society Gala in Washington DC with Michele on Nov. 13, where they sang a beautiful cover of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Lady-Gaga-Shallow-Acceptance-Speech-2019-Oscars-Video-45824346">the Oscar-winning megahit "Shallow"</a> from 2018's <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/A-Star-is-Born"><b>A Star Is Born</b></a>. From Michele's incredible high notes to Lee's tearjerking piano skills, every second of the performance would make <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Lady-Gaga-Bradley-Cooper-2019-Oscars-Performance-Video-45831359">Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper</a> proud. Watch their full performance above, and then treat yourself to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Lady-Gaga-Bradley-Cooper-Performing-Shallow-Videos-45776840">more covers of the iconic song</a>.</p>
