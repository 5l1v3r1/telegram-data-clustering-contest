      <p>Borussia Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc has warned coach Lucien Favre the club's situation is "more than unsatisfactory" and demanded improvements against Barcelona on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Dortmund are struggling for results in the Bundesliga and a 3-3 draw at home against bottom club Paderborn on Friday left them with just two wins from their last eight league matches.</p>
      <p>The Champions League has provided welcome respite for Favre's men this season and they sit second in Group F, just one point behind Barcelona.</p>
      <p>Victory at Camp Nou would ease pressure building on the coach's position.</p>
      <p>While there has been no explicit suggestion of a change in coach at Signal Iduna Park, Zorc made it clear the board are concerned.</p>
      <p>"Obviously the topic will be discussed publicly because our situation is more than unsatisfactory," Zorc told Funke Sport.</p>
      <p>"Of course we will analyse that very intensively. But we are going to the match in Barcelona with Lucien Favre and we expect to see a significant increase in performance there.</p>
      <p>"We need a performance. We finally need a good performance on the pitch so you can look forward."</p>

      <p>Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke also chose to speak out after the Paderborn result, reassuring Favre he still has the club's backing.</p>
      <p>However, he made it clear the team's current form would not be allowed to continue without consequences.</p>
      <p>"Dear Lucien, you still have our trust," Watzke said at the club's AGM. "But in the end football is always defined by results.</p>
      <p>"We all hope you and the team are able to turn this around. You have all the support we can give you."</p>
      <p>Directing a stern message towards the club's players, he added: "Pull yourselves together and play like it is expected from Borussia Dortmund. You as a team must know that only words are not enough.</p>
      <p>"It is your duty to let them be followed by actions."</p>
