      <p>Bitcoin (BTC) futures daily trading volumes on crypto-asset platform Bakkt <a href="https://www.theice.com/products/72035464/Bakkt-Bitcoin-USD-Monthly-Futures/data?marketId=6137543">recorded</a> another all-time high, according to data obtained from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the trading desk’s parent company, which also owns the New York Stock Exchange. Over $20.3 million in Bitcoin futures contracts, or 2728 futures contracts, were reportedly traded on November 22.</p>
      <p>Bakkt’s new daily trading record represents approximately a 66% increase over the previous 24-hour period and is about 30% greater than the previous all-time futures trading high. The <a href="https://twitter.com/Bakkt/status/1192940915033329664">previous record</a> was set on November 9, 2019.</p>
      <p>Open interest from yesterday presently stands at around $1.75 million, which represents a 29% increase over the previous 24-hour trading day. Bakkt was off to a relatively slow start when it first launched in September 2019. However, the trading volumes of the exchange’s physically settled Bitcoin futures contracts have been steadily increasing.</p>
      <p>Bakkt’s latest record volume has come at a time when the Bitcoin price has dropped significantly. BTC fell below $7,000 mark on November 23. Previous surges in crypto futures volumes have also been accompanied by large spikes in BTC price, as experienced from October 25 and November 8 (according to CoinMarketCap data).</p>
      <p>ICE, which runs 23 major exchanges throughout the world, has most recently reported Bakkt’s BTC futures trading price at $7,240 on November 22.</p>
      <p>Bakkt’s management recently revealed that it is planning to further expand its offerings, including Bitcoin-related products, due to increased institutional interest.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Bakkt stated that cash-settled BTC futures would be tradable on ICE Futures Singapore, starting on December 9 of this year. <a href="https://medium.com/bakkt-blog/bakkt-bitcoin-options-on-futures-to-launch-december-9-an-industry-first-8fb2bd686abb">Regulated options contracts</a> for BTC are scheduled to be introduced on the same date.</p>
