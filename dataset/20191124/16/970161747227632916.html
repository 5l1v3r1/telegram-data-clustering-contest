      <p>Posh vacation rental company the Plum Guide is offering travellers and Londoners looking for a staycation the ultimate royal experience complete with corgis and a personal butler – and it will only set you back £50k.</p>
      <p>With literally the entire world glued to their phones and laptops avidly watching Olivia Colman assume the role of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/queen-elizabeth-ii/">Queen Elizabeth</a> II in The Crown, Plum Guide has launched a super OTT royal rental that will literally have you living like a member of the Royal family.</p>
      <p>Where will you stay, you ask? At the Earl of Fitzroy, a palatial Grade I-listed Georgian townhouse in London’s Fitzrovia which was featured in season two of the hit royal drama.</p>

      <p>In addition to the fab digs, the £50,000 mega treat also includes a personal butler, a royal etiquette workshop coached by William Hanson, horse and carriage transportation, afternoon tea (in the company of some corgis) a royal banquet-style dinner, the use of regal jewels and you’ll even get a hamper stocked with some of the Queen’s alleged favourite brands.</p>
