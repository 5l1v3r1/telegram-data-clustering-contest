      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a> Takeover, actually took over <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">Survivor Series</a> this weekend in Rosemont, Chicago and they have definitely set the tone for what could be the best weekend of the year. WarGames made history with the first-ever women's version of the match, even though the match itself was quite controversial it was another notch for WWE to add to the on-going Women's Revolution.</p>
      <p>It was a night that also saw Kevin Owens make his return to NXT for the first time since his tenure as the Champion of the brand when he returned as a face and helped Tommaso Ciampa to defeat Undisputed Era and stake his claim for a rematch for the NXT Championship.</p>
      <p>It was a night that will be remembered for several years, but whilst there were many things to remember there were also several moments to forget.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/roderick-strong">Roderick Strong</a> was part of an impressive War Games match alongside the rest of Undisputed Era as they collided with Tommaso Ciampa, Keith Lee and Dominik Dijakovic with Kevin Owens only being revealed as the fourth member of Ciampa's team on the night.</p>
      <p>This meant that The Undisputed Era were at a disadvantage heading into the match and with Ciampa's team consisting of several bigger guys, it made sense that there were a lot of spots where Undisputed Era was thrown across the ring.</p>
      <p>One of these instances came when Dijakovic and Ciampa threw Strong across the ring and he was supposed to go over both top ropes and take out his team but he lowered down to go through the middle rope and wasn't able to take out his team so they bumped the move anyway.</p>
