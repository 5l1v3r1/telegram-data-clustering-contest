      <p>The prime minister has said Twitter isn’t really his thing, after being questioned about the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/conservative-party/">Conservative Party</a> renaming its official Twitter account to ‘factcheckUK’.</p>
      <p>The party was criticised by official fact checking organisations after renaming its account during the live leaders’ debate on Tuesday this week, making it appear as though it was an impartial fact checking outlet.</p>
      <p>It then went on to offer commentary on Jeremy Corbyn’s performance, in a move described as ‘inappropriate and misleading’.</p>
      <p>As Mr Johnson unveiled his party’s manifesto at Telford earlier this afternoon, he was asked about the change of the Twitter account and whether it undermined trust in the Conservative Party.</p>
      <p>Looking somewhat perplexed by the question, Mr Johnson replied: ‘The Twittersphere is not my province’.</p>
      <p>He went on to add that ‘Labour have some sort of operation which is very similar to this’, before saying he ‘hadn’t really followed this Twitter stuff’ as much as others would like.</p>

      <p>Independent fact-checking charity Full Fact criticised the move at the time and tweeted: ‘It is inappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their twitter account “factcheckUK” during this debate. ‘Please do not mistake it for an independent fact checking service such as @FullFact, @FactCheck or @FactCheckNI”</p>
      <p>Twitter also issued a statement following the incident, warning  that any further attempts to ‘mislead people’ during the election campaign will result in action.</p>
      <p>The company said: ‘Twitter is committed to facilitating healthy debate throughout the UK general election.</p>
      <p>‘We have global rules in place that prohibit behaviour that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts.</p>
      <p>‘Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information – in a manner seen during the UK Election Debate – will result in decisive corrective action.’</p>
