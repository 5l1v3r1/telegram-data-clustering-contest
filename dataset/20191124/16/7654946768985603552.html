      <p>Resistance is futile.</p>
      <p>A bunch of FedEx delivery robots rolled around lower Manhattan as part of a promotion last week, prompting bewildered pedestrians to share videos of the jarring sight on social media.</p>
      <p>“Wall-E out here flexing all over FedEx delivery drivers,” <a href="https://twitter.com/whatisny/status/1197653374746927105">wrote @WhatIsNY</a> while posting a video of one of the boxy cyborgs-on-wheels — part of FedEx’s “SameDay Bot” courier fleet — cutting through a group crossing Crosby Street near Houston Street.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/dzmv3c/saw_a_fedex_robot_in_soho_just_now/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_name=8094652b94984af5a91d3cc23975f2a9&amp;utm_source=embedly&amp;utm_term=dzmv3c">Another video on Reddit showed</a> one of the self-propelled bots spinning on its wheels in Soho.</p>
      <p>“Skynet is sending its soldiers into the streets of NYC,” the writer quipped, referring to the “Terminator” movie franchise.</p>
      <p>FedEx said Sunday that its SameDay Bots — also known as Roxos— were only visiting the Big Apple and are still undergoing testing in other markets. They use artificial intelligence, motion sensors and stair-climbing wheels to travel on sidewalks and along roads.</p>
      <p>“FedEx is not currently testing its SameDay Delivery Bot, Roxo, in New York City,” the company said in a statement. “The Bot was visiting New York for a special event. Future testing plans are not yet determined.”</p>
      <p>Still, Roxo’s brief appearance caused a stir among New Yorkers.</p>
      <p>Chris Livingston, a FedEx customer shipping a package from the East Village, said there is no room for the bots to safely maneuver the streets.</p>
      <p>“It’s bad enough Amazon has tons of boxes filling up sidewalks everywhere, but now I’ve got to worry about that on the sidewalk. It’s one more annoyance in the city,” said Livingston, 42.</p>
      <p>Mayor de Blasio slammed the cutting-edge tech in a tweet, accusing the bot of stealing jobs from New Yorkers.</p>
      <p>“First of all, @FedEx, never get a robot to do a New Yorker’s job. We have the finest workers in the world,” <a href="https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1198377885809152000">Hizzoner wrote</a> Saturday. “Second of all, we didn’t grant permission for these to clog up our streets.”</p>
      <p>City Hall said Sunday the devices will be removed on sight.</p>
      <p>“These large autonomous robots are not allowed on city streets, and they’re a public safety hazard for New Yorkers. We’ll use appropriate methods to remove them immediately,” City Hall spokesman Will Baskin-Gerwitz told The Post.</p>
      <p>But FedEx insisted that the bots employ a number of safety features — and the company will work lawmakers to ensure they meet regulatory standards.</p>
      <p>The bot relies on machine-learning algorithms to map the best routes as well as navigate and avoid obstacles — but it is connected to a remote tower that can intervene, the company said.</p>
      <p>The company is testing how to communicate with customers and securely deliver packages within 3 miles of partnered stores such as Target, Walgreens and Walmart.</p>
      <p>“As with any new technology from FedEx, Roxo will undergo rigorous testing to ensure safety in collaboration with regulatory authorities in test markets,” FedEx said in a statement. “We believe autonomous technology can help supplement operational and service efficiency for our customers and our team members, and even help to create new job opportunities.”</p>
