      <h1>GOP senator questions how Democrats can know Hunter Biden did nothing wrong if they 'don’t look’</h1>

      <p>Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy pushed Democrats to explain how they have confidence that Hunter Biden wasn’t corrupt if he was not investigated.</p>
      <p>Kennedy, 68, noted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff have <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/schiff-signals-he-will-reject-gop-sham-witness-requests">declined to call Biden</a></u> in for questioning. Biden, 49, was hired to be a highly compensated board member of Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company in Ukraine when his father Joe Biden was leading U.S. policy in the region while serving as vice president under President Obama. President Trump requested an investigation into the Bidens during his July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine.</p>
      <p>During an interview on <i>Fox News Sunday</i>, Kennedy questioned those who have written Hunter Biden’s role in Burisma off as a nonissue without further investigation. He claimed the crux of the Democratic impeachment argument lies on whether it was in the national interest or just Trump’s political interest to investigate Biden.</p>
      <p>“According to Speaker Pelosi, President Trump asked for the investigation of a political rival. There’s another scenario, and that is that President Trump asked for an investigation of possible corruption by someone who happens to be a political rival,” Kennedy explained.</p>
      <p>“The latter, if proven, would be in the national interest. The former would be in his parochial personal interest.”</p>
      <p>He added, “Many of my friends in the media say, well, there’s no evidence of any impropriety by Hunter Biden. And my response to that is that the absence of evidence is not necessarily the evidence of absence if you don’t look.”</p>
      <p>Kennedy also noted that he wants to know how Biden earned the high-paying role at Burisma, asking, "What did Hunter Biden do for the money?"</p>

      <p>During the impeachment hearings last week, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch noted that <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/yovanovitch-says-obama-administration-prepped-her-to-answer-questions-about-hunter-biden-during-confirmation">she had been prepped</a></u> by the Obama administration prior to her Senate confirmation hearing to answer questions about Burisma and Hunter Biden’s role on the board, seemingly confirming Trump’s suspicion of the situation.</p>
      <p>U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, however, claimed that Trump only wanted the <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sondland-trump-only-wanted-ukraine-to-announce-investigation-into-biden-not-a-real-inquiry">investigation to be announced</a></u> and did not care if Ukraine actually followed through.</p>
      <p>It looks as though the Senate, under the leadership of Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, may <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-seeks-transcripts-of-biden-calls-with-ukraine-leader">call Hunter Biden to testify</a></u> despite Schiff’s refusal to call him before the House.</p>
