      <h1>Nunes accuses CNN of 'criminal activity' for reporting he tried to get Biden dirt from ex-Ukrainian prosecutor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T16:49:48+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 16:49</time> by <a rel="author">Carlin Becker</a></address>
      <p>Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo put Rep. Devin Nunes in the hot seat amid reports that he met with former Ukrainian prosecutor Victor Shokin in an effort to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>CNN reported on Friday that Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giuliani-associate-prepared-to-tell-congress-nunes-tried-to-get-dirt-on-biden-from-former-ukraine-official">is willing to tell Congress</a> that Nunes met with Shokin in Vienna last year, hoping to obtain political dirt on Biden. Nunes, however, responded to the allegation by claiming the report was false and vowing to sue the network.</p>
      <p>The California Republican joined <i>Sunday Morning Futures</i> and was confronted about the matter when Bartiromo asked, "Bottom line, were you in Vienna with Shokin?"</p>
      <p>"I really want to answer all of these questions, and I promise you I absolutely will come back on the show and answer these questions, but because there is criminal activity here, we're working with the appropriate law enforcement agencies, we're going to file all this, everyone is going to know the truth, everybody is going to know all the facts, but I think you can understand that I can't compete by trying to debate this out with the public media when 90% of the media are totally corrupt," he explained.</p>
      <p>"And because this is criminal in nature and because it's so bad, it's so slanderous, we've got all the facts on our side, and we're going to file in federal court because I’m not going to sit here and try to compete against the media that I have no chance of winning this," he continued. "I will win in court in, and they'll have a chance to cooperate, and they'll have to show how they work with somebody who has been indicted, which is likely conspiring to obstruct justice."</p>
      <p>Bartiromo then said, "Just to be clear, you're saying you're suing CNN" and asked, "You’re telling me that CNN committed criminal activity?"</p>
      <p>"It's very likely. Or they're an accessory to it, right? So none of this is true," Nunes said. "The sad part is, I’m the last guy that wants to go into the courts, but the media has become totally corrupt that now they’re willing to actually engage and help with criminals, indicted criminals. These people are sick, and the only way they’re going to be held accountable is through the court system. And It’s the only chance I have to actually get the facts out for the American people because they can't lie to a court."</p>

      <p>Despite his insistence that the CNN report is not true, a top Democrat indicated on Saturday that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/top-democrat-says-ethics-investigation-into-devin-nunes-is-likely">it is likely Nunes will face an ethics investigation</a> over the allegation.</p>
