      <p>Rescue operations to find three people are still continuing after a person was declared dead in a drowning tragedy in Sea Point on Sunday, National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) spokesperson Craig Lambinon said.</p>
      <p>Three NSRI stations, a Skymed helicopter and emergency medical services were scrambled when the alarm was raised over four people, including a woman who had gone missing in the surf. </p>
      <p>Earlier, surfers found a man, believed to be in his early 20s, and an NSRI rescue swimmer swam out to them. </p>
      <p>CPR was initiated and on the arrival of the first sea rescue craft, and he was put on board and taken to the Three Anchor Bay slipway. </p>
      <p>"Despite extensive CPR efforts, that male, believed to be in his early 20s, has been declared deceased," said Lambinon.</p>
