      <p>Two boys in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california">California</a> were <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide">killed</a> early Saturday while sitting inside a van in the parking lot of an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/primary-elementary">elementary school</a> when an unknown number of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">gunmen</a> opened fire into the vehicle, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The boys, ages 11 and 14, were shot outside Searles Elementary School in Union City, located about 30 miles southeast of San Francisco, Union City police said in a <a href="http://nixle.us/BFTMT">news release</a>.</p>

      <p>The older boy died at the scene and the younger boy died while being rushed to a hospital, police said. Their names were being withheld because of their age.</p>
      <p>"How do you just kill kids?" a mother, whose son was a schoolmate of one of the deceased boys, told <a href="https://abc7news.com/union-city-police-search-for-suspects-in-fatal-shooting-of-2-young-boys/5715937/">KGO-TV</a>. "I don't think he has quite grasped this yet,” she said of her son. “He is afraid to go outside."</p>

      <p>While it was unclear which schools the boys attended, New Haven Unified School District Superintendent John Thompson confirmed they attended schools in the district.</p>
      <p>Family and friends set up a makeshift memorial at the school as police collected shell casings and other evidence for their investigation, KGO reported.</p>

      <p>No arrests have been made in connection to the killings. Police said they were still investigating a motive for the shooting.</p>
      <p>The possibilities that the shooting was gang-related or related to a previous shooting on Wednesday that left two men wounded have not been ruled out, police said.</p>

      <p>Police Lt. Steve Mendez told the Times that there was no sign of a connection between the shooting and the school where it took place. He said people occasionally gather in the relatively secluded parking lot.</p>
