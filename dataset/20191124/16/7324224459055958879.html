      <p>A 26-year-old found stabbed to death after a car crash in west London was one of three young men killed during a weekend of knife violence across the capital.</p>
      <p>A 27-year-old man was knifed to death at a house party, while a third man, 24, died after he was stabbed during a fight in separate incidents in different areas of east London.</p>
      <p>Murder detectives believe the 26-year-old was wounded in an altercation 100 metres away from West Ealing railway station before crashing his car and are not treating the incident as a “road rage” attack.</p>
      <p>Ruth Holmstock, 72, whose flat overlooks the scene of the crash, said she heard a single “thump”.</p>
      <p>“It was one of those ‘oh f***’ sort of crunches,” she said. “The sort of noise you make when you reverse into a gate, but it was loud enough to make me go and see what it was.</p>

      <p>“There were a lot of people hanging around. It looked like any other crash, like they were swapping insurance details.”</p>
      <p>Police were called shortly before 1.20am on Sunday and the victim was pronounced dead at the scene after he was found in a car suffering from a stab wound.</p>
      <p>A picture of the scene appeared to show a saloon car which had been hit by a Mini positioned sideways across Drayton Green Road.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Neil John said: “We believe the victim was involved in an altercation 100 metres from the railway station on The Avenue.</p>
      <p>“This is a busy street with a number of shops and restaurants and if anybody was in the area and saw something, no matter how small, I would urge them to contact police.”</p>
      <p>Ms Holmstock said she saw five police cars, along with an ambulance and other medics’ vehicles.</p>
      <p>She said there was no sign of any injuries at first and police had removed someone from the car.</p>
      <p>“I would never have dreamt that there was anyone injured,” she continued. There was nothing to see. I was really surprised when the police got here.</p>
      <p>“One minute the road was empty and the next minute they were doing CPR on someone.”</p>
      <p>Kiran Ramachandraiah, who lives in the same block of flats, said he woke up at about 2am to see medics trying to revive the victim.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t see the person,” he said. “He was completely surrounded by police and paramedics.”</p>
      <p>The victim has not been formally identified, but Scotland Yard said his family have been told.</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made and a post-mortem examination has not yet been carried out to determine the cause of death.</p>

      <p>Seven men have been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder over the death of the 27-year-old, who was knifed to death at a house party in Whitechapel, east London, on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Three other people were also stabbed, but their injuries are not life-threatening.</p>
      <p>There have been no arrests over the death of the 24-year-old, who died in hospital on Sunday afternoon, after he was found in Ilford.</p>
      <p>Police had been called to reports of a group fighting in Redbridge and another man in his 20s was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries believed to be linked to the incident.</p>
