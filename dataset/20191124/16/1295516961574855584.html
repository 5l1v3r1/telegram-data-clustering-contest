      <p>In 2017, the residents of Gotham City found themselves in the middle of a brutal war between two of Batman's fiercest and most dangerous villains: the Joker and the Riddler. Taking place in Tom King and Mikel Janin's <i>Batman</i> comic series, the so-called War of Jokes and Riddles saw every major Gotham villain have no choice but to pick a side between the Clown Prince of Crime and Edward Nygma. The war, which took place early on in Bruce Wayne's career as a vigilante, lasted a surprisingly long time, and it eventually took its toll on the city.</p>

      <p>It's been years since the two DC villains declared war on one another. But now, it appears there's another dispute brewing. In fact, in <i>Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen</i> #5, we learn that one of Batman's rogues has gone to war with a Superman villain.</p>
      <p>The Toy War has begun.</p>

      <p><i>Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen</i> is not your usual book, because each issue is broken down into little vignettes that feed the series' larger story -- and not always in chronological order. In the previous issue of the series, Jimmy began a prank war with Batman by stealing the bat-signal, and the dispute between the two carries over in issue #5. However, it's when Superman gets involved that we learn about the ongoing turmoil between the Ventriloquist and Toyman.</p>
      <p>While neither villain appears in the issue, we are informed that the Toy War is raging across both Metropolis, home of Toyman, and Gotham City, where the Ventriloquist resides. The citizens of both cities are stuck in the middle of this conflict, and it's up to Superman and Batman to put a stop to it. Just as the Joker and the Riddler were similar villains in some aspects, so too are Toy Man and Ventriloquist. Both have a gimmick that involves toys, whether they are remote-controlled toy planes or puppets.</p>

      <p>The issue doesn't actually show us the war unfolding at a ground level, but it's still interesting to wonder whatÂ it could look like. Are other villains also taking part in it, forced to choose sides like in the War of Jokes and Riddles? Right now, we can only imagine what this new conflict looks like, and the type of devastation the two villains are unleashing on both Gotham and Metropolis.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, further issues of <i>Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen</i> will show us vignettes taking us in the battlefield of the Toy War. And, if not, then we really hope a spinoff miniseries is coming, because this is a story that is begging to be told.</p>
