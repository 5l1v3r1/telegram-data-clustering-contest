      <p>Listings have been taken down from the Showcase website and an automated message at cinemas confirms they'll no longer be showing it.</p>
      <p>The cinemas at Nottingham, Southampton, Reading, and Leeds won't schedule any viewings. </p>
      <p>Carla French, of Southampton, said: "So now not only Vue Cinemas stop the blue story by Rapman, now the showcase cinema de lux in Southampton have? Don't think people understand how hard he worked for this movie for it to be taken away. Bloody stupid. Gutted I won't be watching it tonight."</p>
