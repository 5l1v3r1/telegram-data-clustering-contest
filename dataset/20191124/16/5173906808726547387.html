      <h1>Demands to call off River Sado dredging</h1>

        <b>The People, Animals and Nature Party (PAN) and the left Bloc (BE) have submitted a draft resolution to parliament, in which they recommend that the Government revoke the authorisation granted to the Setúbal Port Authority to carry out dredging in the Sado River.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the draft that entered Parliament on Friday, both parties mention that, as part of the project to improve maritime accessibility and improve competitiveness, more than six million cubic metres of sand are to be dredged from the Sado River.</p>
      <p>"There is no scientific knowledge that can ensure that this does not cause a natural and environmental disaster with devastating and irreversible consequences in the area of the Sado Estuary Nature Reserve, which has legal protection", stresses BE.</p>
      <p>PAN warns that "these dredgings have no precedent and do not resemble the maintenance dredging that the river regularly undergoes" and that "in total, nine times as much sediment will be removed from the river as was removed between 2010 and 2015 in maintenance dredging".</p>
      <p>PAN justifies this initiative with the fact that the work is planned in the immediate vicinity of areas protected by the Community Habitats Directives", and "within the plan to extend the protection of the Sado Estuary, which has been in the approval phase for seven years".</p>
      <p>Both parties evoke the impacts that interventions of this kind may have on the fauna and flora of the Sado, which is a nesting place for hundreds of birds and which hosts a community of bottlenose dolphins.</p>
      <p>PAN also points out that, in general, the dredging measures included in the project involve "too high a risk for the estuary", and recalls that citizens' movements have already demonstrated against this project and resorted to justice, through precautionary measures and administrative actions, to try to stop it.</p>
