      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a> got his tenure as Spurs boss off to a winning start on Saturday as his side <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/west-ham-united-vs-spurs_game_92634.html">beat West Ham United</a> 3-2 at the Olympic Stadium.</p>

      <h3>Match Preview</h3>
      <p>Tottenham made a good start to life under Mourinho, producing a commanding first-half display and opening a three goal lead relatively easily.</p>
      <p>The North London club were able to create a lot of goalscoring opportunities with the possession that they had and against an Olympiacos side who will likely be more than content to sit back and look to hit Spurs on the counter, they should be dangerous again.</p>
      <p>However, one glimmer of hope from that game for Olympiacos will have come from the way that West Ham fought back to grab two goals and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/manuel-pellegrini/"><b>Manuel Pellegrini</b></a>'s men could have nabbed a point if VAR hadn't ruled out <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/declan-rice/"><b>Declan Rice</b></a>'s goal.</p>
      <p>Having had more time to work with the 56-year-old can only be a good thing for Spurs, who <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/olympiacos-vs-spurs_game_96667.html">threw away a two goal lead</a> to draw when these two sides met in the opening round of this year's group stage.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the North London club are unbeaten in their last five games against Greek opposition.</p>

      <p>Olympiacos need to secure a win to keep their feint hopes of progressing to the knockout stages of either the Champions League or Europa League alive.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pedro-martins/"><b>Pedro Martins</b></a>' side only managed to draw against Panionios on Saturday, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mathieu-valbuena/"><b>Mathieu Valbuena</b></a>'s penalty cancelled out by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dimitris-emmanouilidis/"><b>Dimitris Emmanouilidis</b></a>' late strike.</p>
      <p>Although the Piraeus side lined up with a 4-2-3-1 at the weekend, they are likely to opt for a 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 on Tuesday that enables them to sit deeper and counter more effectively through the likes of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daniel-podence/"><b>Daniel Podence</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/bruno-gaspar/"><b>Bruno Gaspar</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/hillal-soudani/"><b>Hillal Soudani</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The stats do not make for favourable reading for Olympiacos, who are winless in their last 12 Champions League games and have only one win in their last 14 visits to England.</p>

      <p>Tottenham remain without the services of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/hugo-lloris/"><b>Hugo Lloris</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/michel-vorm/"><b>Michel Vorm</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/erik-lamela/"><b>Erik Lamela</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ben-davies/"><b>Ben Davies</b></a>, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jan-vertonghen/"><b>Jan Vertonghen</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tanguy-ndombele/"><b>Tanguy Ndombele</b></a> are slight doubts.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is likely to field a similar side to that which beat West Ham at the weekend, although <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/danny-rose/"><b>Danny Rose</b></a> is expected to deputise at left-back in the absence of Davies.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dele-alli/"><b>Dele Alli</b></a> was highly impressive against the Hammers and he should continue just behind <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/harry-kane/"><b>Harry Kane</b></a>, despite <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/giovani-lo-celso/"><b>Giovani Lo Celso</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christian-eriksen/"><b>Christian Eriksen</b></a> pushing to feature from the bench.</p>
      <p>Martins has usually elected to set Olympiacos up a little more conservatively in continental competition, looking to counter teams on the break.</p>
      <p>That is unlikely to change on Tuesday, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andreas-bouchalakis/"><b>Andreas Bouchalakis</b></a> accompanying <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mady-camara/"><b>Mady Camara</b></a> and the more creative Valbuena in midfield.</p>
      <p><b>Tottenham Hotspur possible starting lineup:</b><br/>Gazzaniga; Aurier, Sanchez, Alderweireld, Rose; Dier, Ndombele; Moura, Alli, Son; Kane</p>
      <p><b>Olympiacos possible starting lineup:</b><br/>Sa; Gaspar, Semedo, Papadopoulos, Tsimikas; Bouchalakis, Camara, Valbuena; Podence, Guerrero, Soudani</p>

      <h3>We say: Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 Olympiacos</h3>
      <p>Expect Mourinho to continue to enjoy a strong start to life as manager of Spurs, who should have too much quality on the ball and attacking movement for Olympiacos.</p>
