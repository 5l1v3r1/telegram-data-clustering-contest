        <b>PlayStation fans are in luck this Black Friday, as Amazon has pre-emptively knocked an entire $100 off a special PlayStation 4 Pro bundle.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The deal (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/24/playstation-4-pro-modern-warfare-300-deal/">spotted by Engadget</a>) consists of a jet black 1TB PlayStation 4 Pro console with a matching DUALSHOCK 4 controller along with a copy of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Priced at just $299 instead of the usual $399, it’s a definite deal.</p>

      <p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is also a pretty good game, earning itself <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-is-a-great-title-outside-of-its-political-retrofits-and-buggy-modes/">a nice 8/10 score in our official MSPoweruser review</a> thanks to its “solid campaign and a delightful absence of extra monetisation.”</p>
      <p>While the PlayStation 4 Pro isn’t exactly cutting edge in terms of technology, if you’ve yet to get a PlayStation 4 or if you’re not planning on getting the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/playstation-5-will-finally-include-4k-blu-ray-drive-for-100gb-discs/">PlayStation 5 when it launches in the holiday season of 2020</a>, then it’d be a great buy that’ll keep you entertained until you’re ready to upgrade to the PlayStation 5.</p>
      <p>The PlayStation 4 also has some great exclusives, including Horizon Zero Dawn and God of War. It’s also currently the only way to play <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/death-stranding-steam-epic-games-store/">Death Stranding until the PC version releases in May 2020</a>.</p>
      <p>If you want to pick up the PlayStation 4 Pro with Modern Warfare bundle for yourself or for an extremely lucky person, you can do so <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YLCSHTP/?tag=wmpowcom-20">by following the embedded link here</a>.</p>
      <p>And hey – with the $100 you save, you can pick up a whole range of good games in the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/campaigns/black-friday/">PlayStation Store Black Friday 2019 Sale</a>, which is live now!</p>
