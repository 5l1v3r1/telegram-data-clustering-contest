      <h1>Tuscan convent shut after nun falls in love with local man and is told to leave</h1>

      <p>A PICTURESQUE 17th-century convent in the Tuscan hills has had to shut its doors only four years after reopening, due to an impossible “love story”.</p>
      <p>The Convent of the Cappuccini Fathers in Sansepolcro, which has been run by Benedictine nuns since 2015 – has been closed “definitively”, its website says, despite the ongoing projects recently unveiled by Sister Maria Teresa, the dynamic mother superior.</p>
      <p>The reason for the sudden closure is reported to be because a 40-year-old nun fell in love with a local man, and was obliged to leave the convent.</p>
      <p>This left only three other nuns at the monastery – an 80-year-old and two novices – who would not be able to keep up with the work started by Sister Maria, <i>La Repubblica</i> reported.</p>
      <p>“They are in tears and I’m also crying,” Sister Maria told the Italian daily, adding that it would be hard for her to keep her relationship with the Church after what happened, sparking speculation that she had been forced out.</p>
      <p>In 2015, the former Cappucini convent near Arezzo had been assigned to the Benedettine Olivetane, following years of abandonment, and it had been dedicated to Bernardo Tolomei, a 14th-century saint.</p>
      <p>Sister Maria was admired for turning it into a community hub for generations of locals, thanks to what many described as “her incredible energy” and a strong management style.</p>
      <p>The convent’s nuns harvest olives and fruit, and the building offers 19 beds in the main building for pilgrims, and another 20 in the bungalows in the surrounding woods, plus a big space that was dedicated to baptisms, weddings and other religious celebrations.</p>
      <p>The closure of Sansepolcro’s ancient monastery is not an isolated case: recently, another convent in Anghiari, in the same area, has shut its doors due to a lack of nuns.</p>
      <p>This mirrors a global decline. In 1997, there were nearly 400,000 sisters in Europe, but in 2015 there were less than 300,000. Every year, the number declines by 8,000, according to the Agency of the Congregation for the Evangelisation of People.</p>
      <p>Sister Maria, however, hinted that the end of her tenure at the monastery was not related to her alleged romance.</p>
      <p>“They wanted to tell that story, let’s leave them doing that,” she said, stopping short of giving her full version of events. “The story is much more complicated than it seems.”</p>
      <p>Arezzo’s Bishop Riccardo Fontana said he was not involved in the decision to ask the mother superior to leave the convent. “I have nothing to do with that. There was an intervention of the Holy See and everything ended there,” he said. He added: “This is a very painful situation for all involved.”</p>
