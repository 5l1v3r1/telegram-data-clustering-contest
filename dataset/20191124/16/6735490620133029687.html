      <p>BLACKPINK has just raised the bar for all K-pop groups.</p>
      <p>The video for the South Korean vocal quartet’s single “DDU-DU DDU-DU” has surpassed 1 billion views on YouTube. This makes them the first K-pop outfit to achieve that milestone.</p>
      <p>The music video was released in June 2018, and took a year-and-a-half to climb to a billion views.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time BLACKPINK has made history this year. Back in April, they became the <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/441194/blackpink-makes-coachella-history-as-first-k-pop-girl-group-to-perform-at-festival/">first K-pop girl group to ever play Coachella</a>.</p>

      <p>And that wasn’t all. The group’s music video for single “Kill This Love” <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/438860/blackpinks-music-video-for-kill-this-love-breaks-youtube-record-fastest-video-ever-to-reach-100-million-views/">set a record</a> by reaching 100 million YouTube views in just 62 hours.</p>
      <p>While the “Kill This Love” video has yet to hit the billon-view mark, it has amassed an impressive 659 million views since its release in April.</p>
