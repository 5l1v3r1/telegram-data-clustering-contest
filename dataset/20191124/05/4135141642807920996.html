      <h1>Badgers salvage tie with Minnesota, claim extra point in shootout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T05:25:35+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 05:25</time> by <a rel="author">FOX Sports Wisconsin</a></address>
      <p>Tarek Baker and K’Andre Miller scored in the third period, while Max Zimmer converted in the shootout, as the Wisconsin Badgers salvaged a 3-3 tie with Minnesota on Saturday and claimed an extra point in the Big Ten standings.</p>
      <p>Baker scored just 13 seconds into the final frame to cut the Gophers’ lead to 3-2, before K’Andre Miller’s blast from the blue line tied things up at 5:34.</p>
      <p>Badgers goaltender Jack Berry stood tall through two overtime periods and a shootout, turning aside Minnesota’s Brannon McManus, Ben Meyers and Sampo Ranta. Cole Caufield and Alex Turcotte missed for Wisconsin, <a href="https://twitter.com/fswisconsin/status/1198447713538297856">before Zimmer beat Gophers goaltender Jack LaFontaine</a> to end it.</p>
      <p>Ty Emberson got the Badgers on the board at 18:31 of the first period, before Minnesota scored three unanswered goals to build a two-goal lead heading into the third.</p>
      <p>It’s a welcome result for Wisconsin, which fell 4-1 in Friday’s series opener and has just one win in Big Ten play after splitting with Notre Dame last weekend.</p>
      <p>Minnesota out-shot Wisconsin 38-36, and went 1-for-5 on the power play, while the Badgers went 0-for-4.</p>
      <p>The Badgers (6-7-1, 1-4-1 Big Ten) host conference rival Michigan Nov. 22-23.</p>
