      <p>At least 10,000 fans of "The Sopranos" packed the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey">N.J.</a>, on Saturday for the first <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment">SopranosCon</a> celebrating the 20th anniversary of the iconic HBO show.</p>
      <p>The fans, many dressed in tracksuits and bathrobes, were greeted by more than 54 actors from the 1999-2007 show, including Tony Sirico (Paulie Walnuts); Vincent Pastore (Big P----); and Kathrine Narducci, (Charmaine Bucco), NorthJersey.com reported.</p>

      <p>A large mural of series star James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano) hung over the convention and his widow, Deborah Lin, came to pay tribute to her late husband who died of a heart attack at age 51 in 2013.</p>

      <p>“It’s overwhelming," Lin told <a href="https://www.nj.com/entertainment/2019/11/sopranoscon-brings-shows-extended-family-all-10k-of-them-to-nj-for-20-year-reunion.html">NJ.com</a>. “We’re really touched. The fans are so generous. They say it’s a community. It’s nice to see that everyone cares about and is passionate about something they recognize. Hopefully, it will live on for another 20 years."</p>
      <p>Gandolfini's son, Michael, is set to star as a younger Tony Soprano in a prequel movie scheduled for next September, titled "The Many Saints of Newark."</p>
      <p>“It’s not about the whacking, not about the hitting, not about the Mafiosi, not the card games. It’s about when Tony comes home and A.J. had a bad report card. It’s about the day in, day out of everything,” gold tracksuit-wearing fan Drew Jones who flew in from Chicago for the convention told <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/local/2019/11/23/sopranoscon-fans-flood-secaucus-nj-pay-tribute-hbo-show/4283792002/">NorthJersey.com</a>. “It’s about the banal of life.”</p>

There will certainly be something for everyone.”</p>
