      <h1>Will former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg make a worthy presidential candidate?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T05:38:31+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 05:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/micheline-maynard/9597156" target="_blank">Micheline Maynard</a></address>
      <p>When the American political world hasn't been fixated on President Donald Trump's impeachment hearings, it has been watching things begin to clarify in the Democratic presidential race.</p>
      <p>The strongest candidates seemed to be Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, and former vice-president Joe Biden.</p>

      <p>Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has made a steady rise in many of the polls.</p>
      <p>But now that former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg has filed paperwork to enter the contest, the waters have become muddy again.</p>
      <p>Why would this race need yet another ageing warrior?</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, like Sanders, Biden and Warren, is over 70, while Buttigieg is half their age.</p>
      <h3>A people's party that relies on the uber rich</h3>
      <p>The main problem seems to be that none of them are sympathetic to the needs of Bloomberg's social class, namely billionaires.</p>
      <p>Although the Democratic party has always styled itself as the party of the people, akin to Labour in Britain or the Liberals in Canada, it relies on wealthy leftists in entertainment and business to fund its campaigns.</p>
      <p>And during this campaign cycle, Sanders and Warren have been particularly outspoken in their disdain for those with cash.</p>
      <p>"I don't think billionaires should exist," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/bernie-sanders-wealth-tax.html">Sanders said in September</a>, when he proposed an aggressive tax on accumulated wealth, reaching beyond annual income.</p>
      <p>Warren, who was among the first to propose a wealth tax, is more lenient about their existence, saying she didn't mind if they were around.</p>
      <p>But on her campaign website, she rolled out <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/calculator/ultra-millionaire-tax">a "calculator for the billionaires", </a>with a little jab at Bloomberg, who is worth an estimated $52 billion.</p>
      <p>"If you're Michael Bloomberg, click here," it reads, informing him that he would pay $3.079 billion under her wealth tax</p>
      <p>"Good news â€” you'll still be extraordinarily rich," the site jokes.</p>
      <p>And if you really have an anathema for the super-wealthy, she will sell you <a href="https://shop.elizabethwarren.com/products/billionaire-tears-mug?_pos=1&amp;_sid=a393450ad&amp;_ss=r">a coffee mug</a> that reads, "Billionaire Tears".</p>
      <h3>Bloomberg isn't playing by the rules</h3>
      <p>Apparently, Bloomberg hasn't found all this funny.</p>
      <p>First, he filed the paperwork that would make him eligible to run in primaries in Alabama and Arkansas, two Deep South states.</p>
      <p>And on Thursday, he decided to fully jump in, although he remains somewhat opaque about his goals.</p>
      <p>In a Twitter thread earlier this month, Bloomberg's spokesman Howard Wolfson offered some insight into his client's decision.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>As with his late entry, Bloomberg is not about to play by the established rules, which call for candidates to spend months meeting with voters and barnstorming around the first states to cast primary votes such as Iowa and New Hampshire.</p>
      <p>Alex Burns, a national political correspondent for the New York Times, tweeted that Bloomberg planned to skip the traditional early contests, such as the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, where candidates up until have focused their efforts.</p>
      <p>Instead, if Bloomberg decides to run, he would focus on big states, such as Texas and California.</p>
      <p>"It's a risky play that would disrupt the primary &amp; enrage early-state Dems," Burns tweeted.</p>
      <h3>Does he have the 'magic'?</h3>

      <p>Donald Trump, for his part, has mocked Bloomberg, who served three terms as mayor of New York City and often tangled with Trump through the years.</p>
      <p>"There's nobody I'd rather run against than Little Michael," he told journalists outside the White House when word first emerged of his interest, referring to Bloomberg's short stature.</p>
      <p>"He doesn't have the magic to do well," Trump added. "Little Michael will fail."</p>
      <p>Although Bloomberg's wealth is vastly more than Trump's supposed few billions, Trump holds one enormous card over Bloomberg: name recognition.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Despite his position as mayor, his media empire and his philanthropy, Bloomberg is not a household name across the United States.</p>
      <p>He has been out of the spotlight for much of this presidential race, focusing instead on climate change and a voter registration drive, and certainly does not have the political organisations that the front runners have set up in key primary states, as well as nationally.</p>
      <p>The long pre-primary season has allowed Warren, Sanders and Biden to become familiar faces, while Buttigieg is on the way to becoming one, thanks to his relentless campaigning, media appearances and ability to communicate in multiple languages.</p>
      <p>In contrast to Buttigieg, Bloomberg speaks Spanish badly, and was often teased for his pronunciation, although he made an effort to use it regularly during his mayoral terms.</p>
      <h3>And has he learnt the right lessons?</h3>
      <p>Moreover, the race has already seen one billionaire test the waters and retreat.</p>
      <p>Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, went on a "listening tour" before deciding not to run as an independent.</p>
      <p>For Schultz, notoriety in one field, namely business, did not translate to the broader political arena, nor did many Democrats take kindly to the idea of someone who might split the vote and wind up re-electing Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>It's possible Bloomberg could perform something of a service to the race, by distracting Trump from his frequent attacks on the other candidates.</p>
      <p>But, in order to be taken seriously, Bloomberg still needs to provide a solid response to the chorus of "why?" instead of seeming like a dilettante.</p>
