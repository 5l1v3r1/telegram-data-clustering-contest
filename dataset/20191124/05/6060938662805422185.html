      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Fashion">Fashion</a> faceoffs have become a regular occurrence in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a>. We often see celebrities wearing designer ensembles which are 'inspired' by one another. Their uncanny resemblances of fashion fads later give rise to many comparisons. This time around, we have <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ranveer-Singh">Ranveer Singh</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rani-Mukerjee">Rani Mukerjee</a> who were seen wearing strikingly similar traditional outfits at different times.</p>
      <p>The 'Gully Boy' star is one of the most fashionable male celebrities in the tinsel town. He never shies away from trying something new and quirky. After spiritually celebrating the first wedding anniversary, Deepika and Ranveer were papped at the airport as they returned to the bay. The actor looked sauve dressed in a floral printed metallic dark copper coloured <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/kurta">kurta</a> pyjama paired with a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nehru-jacket">Nehru jacket</a>, headscarf, sunglasses and mojari.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, recently Rani Mukerjee was clicked wearing a similar ethnic outfit for an event. She had teamed up the beautiful outfit with a sheer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/dupatta">dupatta</a> and a pair of Kolhapuri.</p>

      <p>Though both the looks were equally endearing, we thought that Rani's look was pretty but Ranveer looked more charming for the way he pulled it off.</p>
