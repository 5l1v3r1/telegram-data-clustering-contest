      <p>The coal ministry has asked state-owned CIL to either expedite the operationalisation of 110 additional blocks allotted to it or return the mines to the government, an official said.</p>
      <p>The coal ministry recently enquired from the PSU about the operational status of the additional blocks allotted to it, and whether extraction from these <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/coal-blocks">coal blocks </a>is techno-economically feasible, the official added.</p>
      <p>The government was told that of the 110 additional CIL blocks, 50 were explored, 41 were under exploration and balance 19 were partly/regionally explored.</p>
      <p>Further, out of 50 explored blocks, project reports of 25 blocks have been prepared, the coal ministry was informed.</p>
      <p>The ministry "emphasised on quick operationalisation of all of these blocks, otherwise CIL may return them to the Ministry of Coal for their allotment/ auction to other agencies," the official said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/coal-india">Coal India </a>Ltd (CIL) accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output.</p>
      <p>The state-owned firm had earlier said that it will produce 750 million tonnes of coal in the next financial year.</p>
      <p>The PSU will further produce 1 billion tonnes of coal by FY2024, Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi had said.</p>
      <p>CIL is targeting to produce 660 million tonnes of the dry fuel in 2019-20 compared to 607 million tonnes in the last fiscal.</p>
