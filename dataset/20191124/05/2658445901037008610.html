      <p>PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari was not alone in acknowledging the violence that accompanied both the Kogi and Bayelsa November 16 governorship elections. While many Nigerians decried the scale of the violence as unprecedented, particularly in the case of Kogi State, the president saw ‘isolated incidents of violence’ or ‘pockets of unrest sponsored by desperate politicians’. But whether isolated incidents or pockets of unrest, there is little doubt that both elections were degraded by violence, while the president would have helped the cause of democracy by speaking substantially to the process of the elections, if not in his congratulatory statements, at least a little later. There will, however, be no speaking to anything, not now, and not in the foreseeable future. The portents were evident from the beginning of the campaigns in the two states, indeed since the inauguration of the Fourth Republic. If the president saw the problem as severe enough and capable of truncating democracy, he would have spoken and acted proactively. As it is, he made light of everything, including the convulsive and unmistakeable electoral violence of two Saturdays ago.</p>
      <p>The president was enthusiastic about both elections, and quickly embraced the results. He saw the re-election ‘victory’ of Yahaya Bello of Kogi State as “a race well run and a victory well won”, and the electoral feat of David Lyon as “impressive victory”. He left the contentious issue of just how far the so-called isolated incidents of violence and pockets of unrest vitiated the victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidates. Perhaps it would have been unnatural for him to castigate his party’s victory, seeing that he was elected president on the platform of the same party and given the regnant and fawning culture of elevating presidents as leaders of the party. It would be inconceivable for the party’s undisputed leader to say or do anything that would undermine his own leadership and diminish his achievements.</p>
      <p>Since the electoral commission announced the victories of the APC candidates, Nigerians have continued to grapple with an assessment of the elections, with everyone offering diverse opinions on just how much the violence on display in both polls affected the outcomes of the November 16 combat. President Buhari may have left the issue unattended to, but the country has been more forthcoming. They describe Mr Lyon’s victory as probably deserved, considering that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) opponents went into battle divided, and especially because the outgoing governor, Seriake Dickson, had affronted party leaders, including former president Goodluck Jonathan. Yes, there was violence, they acknowledged, but they were not of such a scale as to substantially affect the final outcome of the poll or make the unpolished Mr Lyon less deserving of his electoral success.</p>
      <p>After the humbling poll — perhaps even humiliating defeat — Mr Dickson himself spoke to the reasons his party’s candidate, Douye Diri, lost the election. In his opinion, the spleen widely believed to have been vented by Dr Jonathan over the PDP governorship primary was just a smokescreen for APC’s audacious electoral heist. After all, as the shell-shocked governor argued implausibly, he tried to see the former president, who is a native of the state, numberless times to mend fences. The governor refused to acknowledge that the primary that made Senator Diri the PDP candidate was flawed, and was largely quiet about the fact that his opposition to another aspirant in that primary, Timi Alaibe, was indefensibly personal, especially knowing that Dr Jonathan had a soft spot for the spurned aspirant. If Mr Dickson didn’t take determined steps to avoid fracas in his party’s primary, should he not expect that his fait accompli would be regarded by Dr Jonathan and other party elders as both insufferable and arrogant?</p>
      <p>Violence marred the Bayelsa poll, and it was more than the pockets of unrest spoken of by the president. Indeed, in some parts of Bayelsa, thugs disgraced the electoral process and put themselves inconsiderately between the electorate and the ballot boxes. A fair appraisal of the election in the state should, however, be able to narrow the margin with which the PDP was defeated. But except Mr Dickson, Sen Diri and their party can prove that the violence was significant and rampant, their petition to an election tribunal would be doomed. More damning to Mr Dickson is that very quickly, Bayelsans have seemed to reconcile themselves to the outcome of the poll and relished the way the governor and the PDP candidate were humiliated. They left no one in doubt that they saw and liked how Dr Jonathan lent covert but unmistakeable support to the aspiration of Mr Lyon. The governor-elect will elevate malapropism to a level far in excess of Dame Patience, but who cares? Bayelsans will probably imagine that since their incoming governor thinks in Ijaw language anyway, his actions and policies will not be diminished by sloppy expressions, nor his person demeaned by any manifestation of creek culture in which he is adept.’</p>

      <p>Unlike the Kogi election that was disgraced by every civilised standard imaginable, including the person and style of Mr Bello, the Bayelsa poll may have been truly won and lost. There will of course be comments for some time to come about whether Dr Jonathan displayed wisdom in covertly repudiating his party’s candidate or whether, as the main force in that backwater state, he acted splendidly in unhorsing the pretentious and snobby Mr Dickson. It is not even clear altogether that despite Dr Jonathan making his point handsomely and putting paid to the vaulting ambition of the governor, he himself would emerge from the combat smelling of roses. As probably the most recognisable leader of the PDP in Nigeria today, it remains to be seen whether the future recovery of his party in the country’s politics, not to say in Bayelsa itself, would not be complicated by the loss his intransigence had occasioned his party in the state, a loss that could lead to the diminution of his party and prolong its convalescence probably far beyond 2023.</p>
      <p>Without prejudging the many strong factors that led to the PDP candidate’s defeat, or even prejudging the case Mr Dickson and Sen Diri will present before the tribunal, the Dr Jonathan factor was obviously powerful enough to sway the votes. Did the former president weigh his options with the gravity demanded of his former office and the sensitivity of the position he now occupies in the party before shooting himself in the foot? Or did he consider his options with the customary levity many of his critics attached to his presidency when he led Nigeria? Dr Jonathan may be triumphant in Bayelsa in the last governorship poll, but there is no doubt, notwithstanding the views and actions of some PDP leaders in the Niger Delta, that the former president’s standing in the PDP will henceforth be greatly diminished. Ex-president Olusegun Obasanjo has repeatedly boxed himself into a corner since he left office, and is today virtually neutralised in the country’s political equation. Dr Jonathan may yet have reasons in the future to wonder whether he should not have stomached the indignities offered him by the presumptuous Mr Dickson and stuck to his party in the last poll. The APC may today massage his ego and rhapsodise his ‘statesmanlike’ contributions, but in the long run, Mr Lyon will be beholden almost wholly to the APC, and Dr Jonathan will be viewed with suspicion by his chafing party.</p>
      <p>The Kogi electoral debacle is the clearest indication that President Buhari has blatantly refused to rise to the stature of his office. During last Friday’s APC National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, he wondered and worried whether the APC would survive him. That such fears gnawed at him is an indication that he has done precious little to entrench the virtues and principles that should ennoble his party, the presidency, and democracy. Not only did he eagerly and warmly embrace the Kogi governor’s so-called re-election victory, he also denied the numbing tragedy that afflicted the November 16 poll and, worse, even deployed presidential powers through a conniving senate to facilitate APC dominance. He pretends not to know that the security services took their cues from the presidency to facilitate the electoral travesty that took place in Kogi both before the poll, when Mr Bello inflicted violence on the electorate and sequestered his opponents, and during polling when the law enforcement agencies sheepishly surrendered the state to armed thugs.</p>
      <p>Before the Kogi poll, the police had announced the deployment of about 35,000 men. They either lied to the nation or they ordered their men to adopt a pacifist approach to the poll having read the mind and lips of the presidency. Mr Bello is a well known political charlatan, but he has managed to ingratiate himself with President Buhari. Indeed, the governor is proud to describe himself as soulless and determined to please the president. Despite misruling Kogi, tormenting it, absenting himself from it for much of the time, and despising it through a concatenation of sterile policies, he claims to have won the election fair and square. But he and his supporters know — and have even composed provocative songs to that effect — that they shot their way back into office through orchestrated violence so brazen that only the politics and elections of the 1960s could compare with it. If this is what the president has described as isolated incidents of violence, then he must forgive critics and observers who say he has lost touch and is not as profound as he constantly insinuates or as principled and dogged as he pretends.</p>
      <p>If he says he is unaware of the tragedy that played out in Kogi during the poll, then he must be living in a gilded cage. If he says he is unaware of how his security agents betrayed the constitution, and he persists in describing the election as a well-run race and well-won victory, it must be clear to all that by that singular act, he has defined his presidency. Chief Obasanjo came to that fork in the road in 2007 and lost his reputation and legacy. In 2019, about six months into his second term, President Buhari also came to that fork in the road and, sentimentalising his attachment to a political charlatan, has lost courage, denied and desecrated the constitution, rebuffed common sense, insulted Nigerians to their face, and openly embraced a choice that belittles him in the eyes of the world. The world has taken a measure of the Kogi poll and denounced it. It beggars belief that the president is pleased with it.</p>
      <p>It may be superfluous to refer to the statistical improbability of Mr Bello’s victory, but perhaps the president has not had the chance to work out the arithmetic. Would he like to know that in an election where the turnout is about 36.1 percent, the Okene stronghold of Mr Bello returned a turnout of about 86 percent? In 2015, the same Okene stronghold had a turnout of about 26 percent. But no, the president cannot be persuaded. He has made up his mind to turn a blind eye to the cruel imagination and actions of the unscrupulous governor. But if the president is unaffected by what took place in Kogi, might the judiciary be amenable to reason during the petitions that will naturally folow? It would take unprecedented courage. When Abubakar Audu ran for the governorship with James Faleke on the ticket in 2015 and died on the cusp of victory, the judiciary could not summon the courage to give justice, in some instances even glossing over the points of law argued before them. Mr Bello is unscrupulous and does not mind subverting institutions. He will do anything to keep what he has stolen, an election virtually every election observer group has called for its cancellation.</p>
      <p>Given the wholesale betrayal enacted by security agencies in the Kogi poll, the sheer disinterestedness shown by the president as he endorsed the chaos that took place two Saturdays ago, the neutralisation and disembowelment of the judiciary, and the depressing spinelessness of the electoral commission (INEC), could a cancellation of the Kogi poll amount to anything? It is doubtful. But if it would ginger the president out of his complacency, and he would give the marching orders to the security agencies to respect the constitution, perhaps the situation could be redeemed. But calculating the dynamics of the 2023 poll, in which the APC would want to hold as many states as possible going into the next election as the party’s chairman, Adams Oshimohole, said two days ago, there is little hope that the APC and the president can stand on the side of history. A new election will after all be policed by the same conspiratorial security agencies.</p>
      <p>Last week, in a statement felicitating with ex-president Jonathan on the occasion of his 62nd birthday, his spokesman, Femi Adesina, quoted the president as saying: “President Buhari believes the former President’s legacy of humility and patriotism will continue to resonate, inspiring generations to come on the sacrifices made for the stability of democracy and promotion of sustainable development.” The public should ignore the statement. It is routine and barren. If President Buhari could not be inspired by Dr Jonathan’s noble example of 2015, but has instead taken a very dim view of democracy and embraced an insular perspective of elections, how can he recommend the former president’s behaviour to anyone, seeing that he does not believe in it himself?</p>
      <p>Now, clearly, given what took place on November 16, not to say the absolute lack of reflection on the part of the presidency, the impotence of both the legislature and the judiciary, and the increasing lack of professionalism by security agencies who defy the law and the constitution at will, the country will need a miracle to overcome the crisis it is certain to confront before and during the 2023 polls. It is clear that President Buhari is not a statesman and probably does not have the ambition to be one. Worse, however, even those who desire that appellation — Chief Obasanjo and Dr Jonathan — have been unable to rise to the stature and discipline the title demands of them: Chief Obasanjo by his lack of discipline and virtue, and Dr Jonathan by his lack of judgement and vision. Imagine if Chief Obasanjo had not organised a sham election in 2007, would he not have been able to speak to the sham elections of November 16? And imagine also if Dr Jonathan had kept himself above the fray in Bayelsa, stayed with his party despite the insult to his person and stature, would he not have had the moral high ground to point at the difference between his approach to politics and elections on the one hand, and the Buhari presidency’s cavalier and aggrandising approach to politics on the other hand?</p>
