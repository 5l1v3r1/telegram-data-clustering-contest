      <h1>Why are UK university lecturers going on strike?</h1>
      <h2>Staff at 60 institutions involved in action over pay, pensions and zero-hour contracts</h2>

      <p>Lecturers at universities across the UK are set to go on strike on Monday in a dispute over pay, conditions and pensions. The action by members of the University and College Union follows a strike over similar issues last year. It leaves students facing more disruption and has raised concerns at higher education institutions as they struggle to balance their finances against a backdrop of increasing competition and funding uncertainty.</p>
      <h3>Which universities will be affected?</h3>
      <p>Unless there is an eleventh-hour stand-down, UCU members at 60 universities, affecting some 1m students, will go on strike and “action short of a strike” on eight consecutive weekdays from November 25 until December 4. University lectures at Oxford and Cambridge will be included in the action, but tutorials at their individual colleges will continue as usual. There will be pickets, lectures will be cancelled, andthere may also be “teach outs”, with strikers providing spontaneous unscheduled lessons to students.</p>
      <h3>What is the dispute about?</h3>
      <p>The UCU is demanding that universities cover the costs of recent rises in pension contributions, which are hitting members’ take-home pay. Monthly contributions rose from 8 per cent of salary at the start of the year to 9.6 per cent today. Further increases are also likely. The union also wants bigger wage increases for it staff — it says pay has fallen 20 per cent over the past decade. It is demanding stronger action to close the pay gap for women, ethnic minorities and the disabled, and fewer jobs with short-term or zero-hours contracts, which it says has resulted in increased workloads.</p>
      <h3>What do the universities say?</h3>
      <p>The University &amp; College Employers Association (UCEA) says the financial pressures on higher education make it difficult to increase salaries further. It points out that tuition fees have remained flat for three years and there are uncertainties about future levels of funding and student numbers. The employers’ most recent offer to the UCU included an above-inflation rise plus “progression points” based on years of service that the association says equates to a 4.8 per cent increase for the two-thirds of academics who are eligible.</p>
      <p>Universities UK, which represents employers in pensions negotiations, maintains that the staff’s retirement fund, the Universities Superannuation Scheme, is attractive compared with other schemes. UUK also pointed out that the employers are paying a larger proportion of the increased pension contributions than the members, and that recent USS reforms are “largely” in line with recommendations by an independent joint experts panel. It says the UCU rejected its offer of reducing contributions to 9.1 per cent of salaries and warned that in future staff may need to shift from “one size fits all” pension contributions to different amounts that will result in different benefit entitlements.</p>
      <h3>How will students be affected?</h3>
      <p>University officials stress that the strikers represent less than 10 per cent of the workforce. The employers have pledged to minimise disruption to students by offering course materials online and rescheduling lectures — although the UCU has called on its members to avoid any rescheduling. Universities have also asked staff to work strictly to contract and to prioritise teaching over other responsibilities. Some universities have pledged not to set exam questions on topics that been hit by strike disruption.</p>
      <h3>Will students receive compensation?</h3>
      <p>Some universities have pledged to channel any pay docked from strikers towards student welfare. A proposed class action by students for compensation after last year’s strike failed to gain enough support to proceed, but the Office of the Independent Adjudicator reimbursed some students after they lodged complaints. The awards were typically a maximum of a few hundred pounds for missed teaching hours after deducting library costs and other overheads. Shimon Goldwater, senior associate with Asserson, a law firm, said one difficulty with litigation is the lack of a standardised contract for obligations of universities to students for teaching.</p>
