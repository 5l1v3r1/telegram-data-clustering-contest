      <p><b>Round 1: </b>Both pawing jabs early. First half of the round passes with nothing landing, really, then Ortiz explodes forward with a left hand that does get in, a looping shot, but Wilder gets out of any real trouble quickly. Ortiz has a cut outside the right eye, streaming down his chest. Not a ton of blood, but a steady streak. Slow first round here, but the tension is there. Replay shows the cut came from a little clash of heads. <b>Ortiz 10-9</b></p>
      <p><b>Round 2: </b>First minute of the round, still not a lot going on, a lot of looking for openings and opportunities. Pawing with the lead hands. Ortiz with a little jab to the body. Wilder swings and misses a left hook, Ortiz swings and misses a straight left counter attempt. Wilder flicking out the jab with at least a bit more purpose, not landing it. Wilder backs away from another left, but Ortiz looks at the body just a bit. Wilder getting off the ropes quickly whenever he’s walked back to them. <b>Ortiz 10-9, 20-18</b></p>
      <p><b>Round 3: </b>Wilder starting to look like he’s loosening up a bit more in the legs, starting to look for his left hook. Ortiz springs forward again with a left, not a clean land. Ortiz tries to trap Wilder in the corner, but Deontay gets out quickly. Still not much of anything that matters has landed and there’s a minute left in round three. Ortiz still looking the more comfortable of the two, the one coming forward with what seems like any type of plan. Wilder still waiting and Ortiz pushed a bit more this round, but Wilder did uncork the right late in the round for basically the first time. <b>Ortiz 10-9, 30-27</b></p>
      <p><b>Round 4: </b>Ortiz getting Wilder in the corner and throwing, but doesn’t really close fully. Ortiz is just looking like the guy with more of an idea of what he wants to do. Obviously Deontay always has the eraser at any moment. Alright, now we’re heating up just a bit, Ortiz throwing at least. Wilder starting to chop with sort of an overhand jab punch. Wilder’s right gets blocked. It’s like Deontay wants to counter but Ortiz isn’t giving him anything to counter, really. <b>Ortiz 10-9, 40-36</b></p>
      <p><b>Round 5: </b>Ortiz just isn’t giving Wilder anything, and Wilder isn’t exactly the most creative fighter. Ortiz with a left to the body. Swings another one but misses that time. Wilder actually threw a combination a moment ago but it didn’t land. Ortiz moving forward again, and finally Wilder buzzes him just a bit with a shot to the head. <b>Ortiz 10-9, 50-45</b></p>
      <p><b>Round 6: </b>More TENSION. More ATMOSPHERE. More DRAMA without any actual DRAMA. Wilder with a slappy hook but Ortiz pokes a jab right back at him. Wilder seems like he came here to wait for Ortiz to get tired and sloppy but so far it’s not happening. It’s not that Ortiz is doing anything special other than not letting Deontay detonate, but that’s about all he might need at this rate. I do barely shade this round to Wilder. <b>Wilder 10-9, Ortiz 59-55</b></p>
      <blockquote><b>Round 7: </b>Wilder lands a hook. He misses a right a moment later, Ortiz ducking under it. Wilder lets the right go, partially blocked. Another one let go, might’ve clipped. Shot to the body from Deontay. Ortiz is the guy moving forward still, but he’s just pawing and Wilder is actually starting to throw some punches. Ortiz with a real nice left to the body as he backs Wilder down. Wilder getting walked to the corner and Ortiz lets the overhand left go, but it’s blocked. HUGE RIGHT AND DOWN GOES ORTIZ!!! JUST LIKE THAT!!! HE CAN’T BEAT THE COUNT!!! <b>Wilder KO-7</b></blockquote>
