      <h1>Sarkodie goes in hard for Shatta Wale, disses him for always talking ill about him in new song</h1>

      <p>As many peace makers in the industry are calling on Stonebwoy and <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/unnecessary-beefing-is-your-hobby-but-we-dont-have-time-for-you-social-media-users-blast-manifest-for-teaming-up-with-kelvyn-boy-to-diss-stonebwoy/">Kelvyn Boy</a> to cease fire, it looks like another fearsome battle is about to erupt like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=volcano&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enGH873GH873&amp;oq=volcano&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59j0l6.1899j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">volcano</a><b> </b>between Sarkodie and <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/shatta-wale-goes-after-popular-ghanaian-blogger-for-discrediting-his-grammy-award-nomination/">Shatta Wale.</a></p>
      <p>This is because Ghana’s rapper of the decade has dropped another advice aimed at dimming the arrogance and ill behaviour of his arch-rival, <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/kweku-smoke-completely-destroys-shatta-wale-in-new-diss-song-watch/">Shatta Wale</a>. Sarkodie strategically employed the services of Prince Bright of defunct music group (Buk Bak) on his new project.</p>
      <p>Per the dictates of the lyrical content of the song, Sarkodie subtly labeled Shatta Wale as a pure envious person aiming at his downfall. <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/sarkodie-exposed-for-allegedly-charging-fans-e10-each-for-a-selfie-at-a-show-in-italy/">Sarkodie</a> noted that Shatta Wale thinks of him anytime he wakes up and throughout his whole day looking for ways and means to cause havoc in his camp.</p>
      <p>Enough, analysis of the punchlines employed by <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/sarkodie-personally-paid-for-my-expensive-hye-me-bo-music-video-akwaboah/">Sarkodie</a> will follow shortly.
