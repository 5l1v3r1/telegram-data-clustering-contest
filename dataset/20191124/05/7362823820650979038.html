      <h1>Tennessee students stage walkout over N-word assignment after teacher placed on leave</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T05:58:04+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 05:58</time> by <a rel="author">Dom Calicchio</a></address>
      <p>A teacher in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee">Tennessee</a> who was recently placed on leave over an assignment about the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/first-amendment">use of a racial epithet</a> received some support Friday from a group of students.</p>
      <p>The students at Cane Ridge <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/high-school">High School</a> in Antioch staged a walkout, saying their English teacher was “being persecuted for trying to prepare us for the real world.”</p>
      <p>Photos and videos posted online showed students rallying outside the school, with some holding placards with messages of support for the teacher.</p>

      <p>The assignment in question came as part of a class discussion of the play <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment">“Fences,”</a> about a black man struggling to provide for his family. The play includes several mentions of the N-word, and the school assignment was designed to examine the racism behind the word and the ways people have used it, Nashville’s WTVF-TV reported.</p>

      <p>Students were also asked to write a short essay about the word.</p>
      <p>The written instructions had included the n-word fully spelled out, according to a copy provided to WTVF.</p>
      <p>Some parents found the assignment to be inappropriate for their children, prompting school officials to place the teacher on leave, according to the station.</p>
      <p>One student then launched an online petition in support of the teacher, and other supportive students staged a walkout Friday.</p>
