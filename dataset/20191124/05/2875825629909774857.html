      <h1>Jurgen Klopp gives Mo Salah injury update ahead of Liverpool clash with Napoli</h1>
      <h2>Salah sat out Liverpool's win over Crystal Palace on Saturday following ankle issues as the Reds stayed eight points clear at the top of the Premier League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T05:54:17+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 05:54</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp says Mo Salah will be fit for Liverpool's Champions League clash with Napoli at Anfield on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Salah was left on the bench as <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> won 2-1 away to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday to maintain their eight-point lead at the top of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Egyptian forward has been hampered by an ankle injury recently after he was caught by <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City's Hamza Choudhury six weeks ago.</p>
      <p>He was not needed against Palace as Roberto Firmino's late winner earned Liverpool the three points after Wilfried Zaha had cancelled out Sadio Mane's opener.</p>
      <p>But Liverpool boss Klopp said Salah was fit for the Selhurst Park clash, and will be back in the starting line-up as the Reds face Napoli looking for the win that would secure top spot in Group E.</p>

      <p>“Mo is all good,” said Klopp. “He couldn't train for nine days.</p>
      <p>“He was with Egypt, went home, trained 60-70% the day before yesterday, and was first time 100% yesterday.</p>
      <p>“We had to make the decision whether to start him or not. We didn't start him, we were about to bring him on when we scored the winner (with five minutes remaining).</p>

      <p>“So we could rest him today. That's really good. Wednesday he will be back.”</p>
