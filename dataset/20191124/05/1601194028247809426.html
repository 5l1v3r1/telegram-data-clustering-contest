      <p>The ladies and gents of NXT put on a barnburner of a show during tonight's <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt-takeover">NXT TakeOver: WarGames</a>. Usually, when there's an NXT PPV before a standard WWE one, the question on everyone's lips is "will the main roster PPV be able to meet the quality of NXT's show?" This month, however, things are a tad bit different.</p>
      <p>You see, this will be the first main roster show that involves all three brands - <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/raw">RAW</a>, SmackDown, and NXT. Now, sure, NXT folks have shown up as participants in their respective gender's Royal Rumble matches. But, I'm not talking surprise appearances - I'm talking actual advertised matches.</p>
      <p>That means that what happened on tonight's TakeOver will have a direct effect on Sunday's event.</p>
      <p>So, yeah, let's take a look at a few ways how.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>#3 There's going to be some battered and bruised NXT folks</h3>

      <p>There's no getting around it, pretty much every match at TakeOver: WarGames was, well... a war. All of NXT's champions - Shayna Baszler and everyone in the Undisputed Era - as well as NXT champion Adam Cole's challenger, Pete Dunne, took a serious beating during the show,</p>
      <p>Fortunately for all the champions, save for Cole, none of their titles are actually up for grabs on Sunday night. The Panama City Playboy, on the other hand, not only has to defend his title against Dunne, but he probably took the worst beating of all the other champs during his match. After all, he did crash through a couple of tables after falling off the top of the dang cage! So, he's probably going to feel a little sore tomorrow.</p>
      <p>These are all tough folks, and they're sure to be able to hold their own during Survivor Series. But, it should definately play a factor in Sunday's matches.</p>
      <p>Oh, and lest we forget - Kevin Owens, who was the surprised fourth member of Team Ciampa in the WarGames match, is still a part of Team RAW on Sunday. And, since we don't yet know who is on Team NXT, they could very well send in a squad of fresh competitors, putting Team RAW at a disadvantage.</p>
