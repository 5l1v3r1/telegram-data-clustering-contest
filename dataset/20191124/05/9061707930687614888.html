      <h1>Derby mum claims her daughter 'struggles to breathe' due to mouldy house</h1>
      <h2>It has forced the 11-year-old to use an inhaler, she says</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T05:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Grant</a></address>
      <p>A Derby mum says that her daughter needs an inhaler because of mould in her Derwent Living home, despite not having asthma.</p>
      <p>Tanya Mcaulay, 34, moved <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/sinfin">into the Sinfin house</a> six years ago. She lives there with her daughter Ashley, who is 11.</p>
      <p>She said that the mould has been present since she moved in and that she has complained to Derwent Living several times.</p>
      <p>Ms Mcaulay, who stated that she suffers from osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia, which causes her constant pain, said: "Since we moved in to this property, when my daughter Ashley gets a cold or a cough she gets an inhaler because she can't breathe properly. She can't seem to get it off her chest."</p>
      <p>She also said her daughter's room was extensively damaged by rain on November 8.</p>

      <p>"It started to stain, you could see the beams through the ceiling, bits of damp came through, that's when I reported it.</p>
      <p>"I sent them pictures and they just said it was damp and sent an email back explaining how you should deal with damp in a property.</p>
      <p>"I tried to explain that I can't fix my ceiling, I told them I'm disabled and I can't get up a ladder to fix the ceiling.</p>
      <p>"I just want the property back to a decent standard."</p>
      <p>Eventually, despite her complaints, the damage resulted in a hole in the ceiling through which rainwater poured.</p>
      <p>She said that Derwent Living booked for it to be fixed on December 9, almost four weeks later.</p>

      <p>Ms Mcaulay said she had contacted Derbyshire Live because she felt like Derwent Living were "not interested" and that "instead of replacing stuff it's just fix after fix after fix"</p>
      <p>"I'm over £500 in credit with them on my rent so I want my repairs doing, I have damp all through my house and my windows in every room are rotten and have mould all over."</p>
      <p>The former care worker said that she had to remove her carpets, and the damage will cost hundreds to fix.</p>
      <p>When asked if he could help fix the issue at the property, in Campsie Court, her partner, Aaron Owen, 35, who has worked as a council contractor before, said: "I shouldn't be dealing with the damage because it's their property. They're quick to remind you it's their property if you're short on your rent."</p>
      <p>Though Derwent Living has sent workers to the house before, Mr Owen said: "There's never any quality in their work. I've worked for councils before so I understand they're short on resources but they should take pride in their work."</p>
      <p>Andy Nickels, head of asset management at Derwent Living said:<i> “</i>We replaced some broken tiles on Ms Mcaulay’s roof following a report of a leak in her bedroom. We have also booked a follow up appointment for Monday 25 November to determine what further work needs to be carried out and to look at the mould and damp Ms Mcaulay has reported since the leak in the bedroom.</p>
      <p>"We will continue to work closely with Ms Mcaulay to support her with her property and its care."</p>
