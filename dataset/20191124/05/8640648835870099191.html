      <p>With first-place Edmonton rolling into town Saturday to close the Golden Knights’ four-game homestand, Vegas coach Gerard Gallant expected a big effort from his team.</p>
      <p>Following a 4-2 loss at T-Mobile Arena, Gallant was left disappointed in his team’s overall compete level.</p>
      <p>“It starts with effort,” Gallant said. “The execution wasn’t there tonight. I agree 100 percent, but it’s got to start with competing and battling and winning those battles and getting your nose dirty a little bit. And it’s not all the guys. There’s some guys. We’ve got to get more of a team game.”</p>
      <p>The Knights were unable to contain Edmonton’s high-scoring duo of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, as the NHL’s leading scorers combined for five points.</p>
      <p>McDavid finished with two goals, and Draisaitl added three assists to take over the NHL scoring lead from his teammate with 47 points in 25 games. McDavid is second with 46 points.</p>
      <p>McDavid’s 15 career points are the most against the Knights all time.</p>
      <p>“There’s lots of talk of us two right now, but I thought it was a complete team effort tonight,” McDavid said. “It started with (goaltender Mike Smith). That’s a great bounce-back game for him. Great bounce-back game for our whole group.”</p>
      <p>Cody Eakin and Shea Theodore scored for the Knights, who lost their second straight. Knights goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury made his fourth straight start and had 27 saves.</p>
      <p>“They were a lot better than we were. A lot quicker,” Gallant said. “We didn’t defend well in our zone and made some mistakes, and they took advantage of it for sure. We didn’t do the job in the d-zone good enough.”</p>
      <p>Here’s what stood out from the loss:</p>
      <h3>1. Together again.</h3>
      <p>Gallant made a minor change to his lineup by swapping left wings Jonathan Marchessault and Max Pacioretty. That put Marchessault back on the top line with William Karlsson and Reilly Smith.</p>
      <p>The move didn’t have the desired effect, as the Knights fell to 4-13 in games when they’ve scored three or fewer goals.</p>
      <p>Gallant even went to his line blender in the third period, giving Cody Glass a chance to center Alex Tuch and William Carrier.</p>
      <p>“You think we’re going to come out with some fire, and there was no fire. There wasn’t enough fire for me,” Gallant said. “Disappointing in that part of it.”</p>
      <h3>2. Finishing touch.</h3>
      <p>Theodore went 20 games without a goal before scoring arguably the Knights’ prettiest of the season with 5:41 left in the second period to cut Edmonton’s lead to 3-2.</p>
      <p>Theodore intercepted a pass near center ice, faked a shot after he crossed the blue line and danced between Oilers defensemen Adam Larsson and Oscar Klefbom.</p>
      <p>He then slid a shot between the pads of Edmonton goalie Mike Smith for his second goal and first since Oct. 10 at Arizona. Theodore had a career-best 12 goals last season.</p>
      <h3>3. Falling off the pace.</h3>
      <p>The Knights continued to come up short against quality opposition, falling to 1-6-2 against teams that are currently in a playoff position.</p>
      <p>Edmonton moved seven points ahead of the Knights in the Pacific Division and were head and shoulders the better team.</p>
      <p>The Knights play five of the next six on the road starting Monday against Dallas, which has won six straight.</p>
      <p>”I think we just have to get back out on the road and play a simpler game and a harder game,” Theodore said.</p>
