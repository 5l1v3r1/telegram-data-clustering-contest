      <p>REUTERS: The remarkable rise of Brendon Todd showed no sign of waning when he charged into the third-round lead at the RSM Classic in Georgia on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Todd, seeking a rare hat-trick of consecutive victories on the PGA Tour, used another sublime putting display to card eight-under-par 62 on the Seaside course at Sea Island.</p>

      <p>It was just about the worse score he could have shot, as he lipped out several putts, including a 30-foot birdie chance at the last that left him laughing when it caught a large part of the cup but refused to drop.</p>
      <p>Todd posted an 18-under 194 total with one round left.</p>
      <p>Fellow American Webb Simpson (63) and Colombian Sebastian Munoz (66) are equal second on 16-under.</p>
      <p>Todd was ranked 525th in the world before winning the Bermuda Open three weeks ago.</p>
      <p>He followed up with victory at last week's Mayakoba Classic in Mexico.</p>
      <p>A win on Sunday would make him the first player since Tiger Woods in 2006 to win three consecutive PGA Tour events.</p>
      <p>Dustin Johnson in 2017 was the last to win three straight starts, though he skipped a tournament during that run.</p>
