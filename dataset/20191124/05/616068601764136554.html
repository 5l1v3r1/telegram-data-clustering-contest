      <p>In November 1991 marked the end of an era for Vernon.</p>
      <p>It was on that day the final bin of apples was lowered onto the production line of the R.H. MacDonald &amp; Sons packing house, while 40 seasonal employees looked on.</p>
      <p>The packing house, the last in Vernon, was closing its doors, marking a big change for a city that was once an agricultural hub of the Okanagan.</p>
      <p>The packing house operated for nearly 60 years.</p>
      <p>It was opened in 1933 by Robert MacDonald, who came to BC from his native Nova Scotia in 1896. MacDonald first worked as a carpenter at the Coast and aboard the S.S. Minto on the Arrow Lakes.</p>
      <p>He tried to strike it rich in the Klondike Gold Rush, to no avail, before returning to Nova Scotia to marry his sweetheart, Stella Falconer.</p>
      <p>The couple lived in Yukon and Vancouver, but decided a smaller community would be a better place to raise their six children. MacDonald purchased a farm in the BX District, and became active in the fruit industry. Prior to the opening of the packing house, the family packed and sold the apples from their 85-acre farm themselves.  </p>
      <p>The packing house, which stood on Vernon’s main drag, employed 35 to 40 women during the Second World War, as jobs that were traditionally held by men were freed up when troops went overseas.</p>
      <p>The women learned to pack using wooden apples, before moving to the more tender fruit.</p>
      <p>Jean, the youngest MacDonald child, once said “it was a joy to watch women pack those apples with thin white paper on each one.”</p>
      <p>Her brothers, Ian, Bob and Bill, all worked at the plant, and Jean was employed as the secretary. </p>
      <p>The business expanded in 1945 when a larger packing house was built.</p>
      <p>The MacDonald family continued to operate the packing house until 1972, when it was purchased by a group of growers from Kelowna.</p>
      <p>The business closed its doors for the last time in 1991, but the building still stands.</p>
