      <p>It's about five days early, but <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Amazon</a> has already dropped the price of the Pixel 4 to just $599, and the Pixel 4 XL to $699. Those are the prices the Pixel 4 family are going to be on Black Friday. Which makes this a really great time to pick one up. As you are able to beat the rush and get yours now.</p>
      <p>The Pixel 4 is the latest Pixel from Google. It comes running on Android 10 â€“ the latest version of Android. It also has a new camera with a telephoto sensor, which can take some pretty incredible pictures. Though that's nothing new for Google and the Pixel.</p>
      <p>With the new telephoto sensor, you're able to get even better zoom shots. Google is able to use some software magic to make zoomed in shots look better than cropped images.</p>

      <p>Internally, both smartphones sport the Snapdragon 855 chipset, 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The Pixel 4 has a 5.7-inch full HD+ display, with the Pixel 4 XL sporting a 6.3-inch Quad HD+ display. The only other difference between the two is the battery sizes, which are 2800mAh and 3700mAh capacities, respectively.</p>
      <p>Google included Soli on these smartphones, which is radar. With this, you're going to be able to get some really great facial recognition, but there's also some cool features like being able to wave your hand over the phone and move to the next song, answer or decline a call and so on. It works really well, at least in my opinion.</p>
      <p>The Pixel 4 is a really great smartphone to pick up, but it's not a no-compromise smartphone, as I said in our review of the Pixel 4 XL back in October. It does suffer on the battery side, but the Pixel 4 XL has less of a battery issue than the Pixel 4 does.</p>
