      <p>Vernon's mayor is pleased to see the number of homeless in the city has dropped.</p>
      <p>Victor Cumming was commenting on the most recent point-in-time homeless count conducted in mid October.</p>
      <p>Last year, the count found 161 people were living rough in the city. This year the count found 151 living on the streets.</p>
      <p>“The numbers are down and that's good for us, good for Vernon,” said the first-term mayor. “It shows the impact of the two facilities that have been established recently and it's an indication from my point of view that there is more work to do and that requires more funding through the province and more low-cost housing.”</p>
      <p>In July, the 52-unit My Place apartment complex opened, getting roughly 60 people off of the streets.</p>
      <p>“We need more permanent housing. Those who are the bottom end, that's what they need more than anything else,” said Cumming. “That is what we need. That's what's going to have an impact on those numbers.</p>
      <p>“CMHA in Vernon have now been approved for 30 units which will get under construction hopefully quickly as possible,” said Cumming of plans to expand Albert Place on 25th Avenue.</p>
      <p>The new units will be comprised of multiple bedroom and single bedroom dwellings.</p>
      <p>“Some of those units are very heavily subsidized and those are the solutions we are looking for,” said Cumming.</p>
      <p>A full report on the homeless count will be presented to council Monday.</p>
