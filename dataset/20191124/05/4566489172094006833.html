      <p>Uruguay's long-dominant leftist ruling party faced defeat in a presidential election run-off on Sunday as the small South American country prepares to swing to the right.</p>
      <p>Opinion polls showed that Luis Lacalle Pou, the 46-year-old leader of the center-right National Party, is likely to win as voters appear set to turn the page on 15 years of leftist rule.</p>
      <p>Lacalle Pou, a senator, trailed the ruling Broad Front candidate Daniel Martinez in last month's first round, but a pact with center-right and right-wing parties following simultaneous legislative elections has given him a majority in Congress as well as a significant lead heading into the run-off.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"Polls suggest he has a 6-8 point lead, although the result may well tighten," said Robert Wood, Latin America manager for the Economist Intelligence Unit.</p>
      <p>A win for the right would "reflect a trend in the region of voters rejecting the incumbent party over disappointing results."</p>
      <p>- Voter turnout -</p>
      <p>With bright and sunny weather, more than 70 percent of the country's 2.6 million eligible voters had cast ballots three hours before the polls were due to close at 7:30 pm (2230 GMT), Electoral Court chairman Jose Arocena said.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"We want the Front to win, because we feel that with the left our rights are guaranteed," said Juan Pablo Abella, 40, as he walked to a polling station in Montevideo's upmarket Villa Biarritz district with his wife and nine-year-old daughter.</p>
      <p>Abella said both he and his wife were born under Uruguay's dictatorship and for them, voting was both a right and a duty.</p>
      <p>"Seeing how things are in the region, not everyone has the possibility to choose. You have to value that," he said.</p>
      <p>The run-off is effectively a referendum on 15 years of rule by the Broad Front -- or Frente Amplio -- which has won the last three elections.</p>
      <p>"Voters are tired of economic stagnation, high unemployment and rising crime since the end of the commodity supercycle and will look to Mr Lacalle Pou for improvements," Wood told AFP.</p>
      <p>Inflation is running at 7.5 percent and unemployment at 9.0 percent.</p>
      <p>Outgoing president Tabare Vazquez noted turmoil sweeping Latin America -- the resignation of Evo Morales as president of Bolivia, and sometimes violent street protests in Chile and now Colombia -- and said Uruguay will carry out a smooth transfer of power to a new president in March of next year.</p>

      <p>"The people of Uruguay can rest assured that we are going to achieve this," Vazquez told reporters.</p>
      <p>In a highly unusual incident in the early hours of Sunday, a bus carrying military personnel to guard ballot boxes was stoned by people participating in an electronic music festival in Montevideo.</p>
      <p>Uruguyan media and videos circulated on Twitter showed several cars had been damaged.</p>
      <p>"When I saw that this morning, I thought it was another country. Unfortunately it was Uruguay," said Lacalle Pou, who has promised to get tough on rising crime levels.</p>
      <p>- Legalized cannabis -</p>
      <p>The Broad Front, a coalition of leftist movements, can point to a record of progressive governing since it broke a decades-long conservative stranglehold on the government in 2005.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>Uruguay stood out on the international stage by approving abortion and gay marriage, and the small nation pioneered the legalization of cannabis in 2013.</p>
      <p>But Lacalle Pou has tapped into voter concerns over the country's high tax rates and promised to look elsewhere to raise the $900 million needed to reduce the public deficit, nearly 5.0 percent of GDP.</p>
      <p>"Uruguay can't bear any more taxes," he told supporters.</p>
      <p>The latest polls show the challenger with 51 percent, comfortably ahead of the 43 percent for outgoing Montevideo mayor Martinez.</p>
      <p>Uruguay has long been considered a bastion of peace and stability in an often turbulent region.</p>
      <p>"Uruguay continues to be cited as an example of a functioning democracy in the region, whilst rejecting extremist populists outcomes," said Paul Hare of Boston University.</p>
      <p>"It is an example for other regions, including the United States," Hare told AFP.</p>
      <p>But security has been declining, with a sharp rise in some violent crimes reported last year.</p>
      <p>In 2018, South America's second-smallest country registered a record 414 murders, up 45 percent on the year before.</p>
      <p>The next president will take office in March for five years.</p>
