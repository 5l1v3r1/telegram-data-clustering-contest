      <p>While you are enjoying a laid back Sunday morning, waiting in your bed for the perfect brunch, Bollywood actor Kartik Aryan had already given his morning a kick start with a ride on the empty roads. Not just this, he made music his ride buddy, and he enjoyed a number of his own movie songs on a high volume.</p>
      <p>Three songs that topped his list are ‘Dheeme Dheeme’ from his soon to release ‘Pati Patni Aur Woh’, ‘Ankhiyon Se Goli Mare’ from the same movie and ‘Bom Diggy’ from ‘Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety’. Kartik shared the video of him enjoying all these songs on his social media handle and was seen even singing the last one while handling the steering wheel.</p>
