      <h2>Pep Guardiola has his say on Chelsea FC's impressive start to the season under Frank Lampard</h2>

      <h3>Pep Guardiola has heaped praise on Frank Lampard for the solid start he has made to life in charge of Chelsea FC.</h3>
      <p>Lampard was brought in as Chelsea FC’s new manager back in July after Maurizio Sarri left the club after just one season in charge.</p>
      <p>The former England international had his hands tied in the summer transfer window due to the club’s transfer ban, and Lampard has earned praise for choosing to place his faith in young players this season.</p>
      <p>The likes of Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori have been regular fixtures in the Chelsea FC team this season and have helped them to gradually climb the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>There have been some comparisons drawn between Lampard’s start at Chelsea FC and Guardiola’s initial years in charge at FC Barcelona.</p>
      <p>And Guardiola was asked about the possible similarities before Chelsea FC’s trip to Manchester City in the Premier League this weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1208132/Man-City-news-Pep-Guardiola-Chelsea-Frank-Lampard-Barcelona">Speaking</a> before the game, Guardiola said: “In those terms it is quite similar, he was not with the second team for Chelsea, but yes, in those terms you could say there is a comparison, but it’s too early.</p>
      <p>“He’s just done one and a half years, I’ve done longer as I’m older but he has the future in his hands. From the beginning under Frank his team has played good.</p>
      <p>“They have been consistent with his ideas and I’m happy for him. I know him a little bit and I know when he was here at City he was an excellent person.</p>
      <p>“For English football it’s great when young English guys take over.</p>
      <p>“It is similar to when I arrived at Barcelona maybe – not many people trusted me. Maybe Frank is similar, it will be difficult if he didn’t get results but look now. When nobody trusts you it’s perfect. If nobody trusts you it’s perfect.</p>
      <p>“If you don’t have doubts and be clear what you want to do, it’s easier than to do a big job in Chelsea or Barcelona as you have incredible players, the results can come.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC will return to Champions League action on Wednesday night with a trip to Spain to face Valencia.</p>
      <p>They will then take on West Ham United at home in the Premier League next Saturday afternoon.</p>
