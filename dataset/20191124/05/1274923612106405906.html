      <h1>Reach Beta - The Final Week - Open to all</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T05:32:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 05:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dotabuff.com/players/40697769" target="_blank">Cptn.Canuck</a></address>
      <p>The Reach Beta has been a valuable and eye opening month for us at Elo. We've had many of our assumptions challenged, and made a lot of changes to key systems to adapt as the feedback has rolled in. The improvements have been immense and we couldn't possibly be more excited to see people begin to play in Season 1 for the chance to attend the first <a href="https://pro.eslgaming.com/academy/">ESL Academy</a> event.</p>
      <p>This blog post will cover a lot of the updates we've made to the league, and the changes you'll see if you've taken a break at any point in the beta, as well as an announcement that we've officially opened the site open to everyone.</p>
      <h3>Open to all</h3>
      <p>Firstly, we want to announce that we've officially opened the entire site up to users of all skill levels. As long as you have a Dota 2 ranked medal, and it is displayed on your Dotabuff profile, Reach will set an appropriate seed ranking for you, and you'll be able to queue. We're aiming to get a lot of test games in over the coming week, so please visit <a href="https://www.reach.gg/schedule">the schedule page</a> and find out what times we're open. If you're not already in it, please join our <a href="https://www.dotabuff.com/blog/www.discord.gg/4jjjbvt">Discord server</a>, and you'll be able to coordinate with other players, report issues with people in your games, and see more frequent announcements and updates from our development team and admins.</p>
      <p>Additionally, even if you don't have a ranked medal, but want to see what Reach is all about, you can now head to the site as we've removed the beta gate, and from there you'll be able to see user profiles, <a href="https://www.reach.gg/leaderboards">The Leaderboards</a>, and more. We'll be adding new features soon such as featured streams and a match listing so you can look for high level replays.</p>
      <h3>Matchmaking</h3>
      <p>Our matchmaker has seen multiple iterative fixes in response to player feedback on games. We've upgraded our matchmaker in two major fixes and a number of minor ones that have resulted in matches being balanced more evenly, and giving us controls to widen search parameters if players are experiencing longer queue times. We now confidently have the ability to responsively expand queues in response to player demand and have been monitoring sessions closely to respond to player needs.</p>
      <h3>Behavior</h3>
      <p>Our automated penalty systems have seen major upgrades as well. We've added detection for players who dodge by deliberately failing to load, as well as increased penalties to ramp up far more harshly for dodgers. We're working on refining the behavior score system further to dole out harsher penalties for general negative behavior, and abandonment.</p>
      <p>Additionally, we've hired three admins (and are interviewing for one more) who will be coming on to not only help moderate the community, but to help gather feedback and propose new features for the league. The people we've hired are experienced in esports and know the community well, so we'll be leaning on their knowledge to help elevate the players in the league and manage the player base in the best way we can. This is part of our commitment to working with our players to curate a more committed and serious community of players and keep the smurfs, griefers, and game ruiners out of your Reach experience.</p>
      <h3>Tech</h3>
      <p>Although this stuff can tend to be hidden to players, we've made a lot of upgrades to the underlying tech that powers Reach. We've increased the efficiency and robustness of our bots, causing them to fail far less often, and recover more quickly when they do. We've created systems that find and score matches that do not have replay data, creating more reliability in our scoring algorithms. We've created error handling for situations where a lobby fails to load, or where the game coordinator goes down. Additionally, we've added a number of tools to our administration back end, that allow us and our admins to handle player issue reports more efficiently. These allow us to track users behaviors, as well as match stats and bots much more easily and gives us some more flexibility in the way we moderate community behavior. Finally we've also removed the beta gate to the site allowing anyone to check in on the leaderboards and see how everything runs.</p>
      <h3>Scoring and Divisions</h3>
      <p>There was a lot of feedback in the first few weeks about decisions we had made with the league divisions and scoring systems. We've modified these systems quite a bit, and settled on a scoring system that simply awards a bonus 2 points for your first three wins of a day, a change that was highly requested and we agreed with. We're also working on the launch version of Pinnacle currently which will see Pinnacle trimmed down to a tighter group of 500 of the best players so that the skill spread across Pinnacle isn't as great as the entire immortal pool that it was before. We'll be following up with another blog post this week with details on how you can claim your spot in that elite 500 a bit later in the week.</p>
      <p>We also opened up to Divine level players, and now we are opening the ladder to anyone (details below). It's important to us to get a full sampling of players across our ladder so that we can test all systems in full, and ensure that our systems can handle any load thrown at them.</p>
      <h3>Prizes</h3>
      <p>This has been a rather consistent question we've gotten: "When am I getting paid?" We've finished adding the identity verification system to the site and are just awaiting for a review from a third party company before we can get the credentials we need to send that system out live to players. This was a step that we anticipated to only take a couple of days, but it ended up being a more time-consuming process and has pushed back our payment verification by much longer than we wanted. Rest assured though, prize winners will be paid out in full, and we'll be reaching out to you as soon as we get word back from this third party. We want to apologize for the delays, and thank you for your patience.</p>
      <p>We'll be following this up with a blog post in the next couple days that details all winners of the beta sprints, much like the <a href="https://www.dotabuff.com/blog/2019-11-08-reach-beta--week-1-winners-and-league-update">week 1 post</a>, so if you were a winner, please stay tuned for that.</p>
      <h3>Thank you</h3>
      <p>Finally, we want to thank the community for their engagement, their suggestions, and their feedback. Running a league on this scale and building the tools required to support the community is a daunting task, and one that's taken a lot of our time and energy over the last while. However we're getting a handle on things and believe that this will be something that the community can rally around, come the full launch on Monday, December 2nd. We'll be running one more beta week between now and then to collect test data on the Contender division and track how those systems are running, then we'll be hitting the ground running for launch.</p>
      <p>ESL and Dotabuff are committed to supporting the Tier 2 scene, and want to see tomorrows stars grinding it out in a moderated, competitive, and serious league. Please communicate with us any ways you think we can do that better.</p>
