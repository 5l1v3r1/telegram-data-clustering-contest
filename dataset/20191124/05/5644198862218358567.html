      <p>REUTERS: Kenya's marathon sub-two hour man Eliud Kipchoge and American 400m hurdles world record holder Dalilah Muhammad were named World Athletics athletes of the year on Saturday (Nov 23).</p>
      <p>Their titles were announced at the annual awards ceremony of the sport's governing body in Monaco.</p>

      <p>Kipchoge retained the award thanks to his barrier-busting marathon in Vienna in October.</p>
      <p>The Kenyan Olympic champion clocked one hour, 59 minutes and 40 seconds over the 42.2km distance, though the record is unofficial because he used rotating pacemakers.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy to be the first human being to run under two hours," said Kipchoge, who also holds the official world record of 2:01:39.</p>
      <p>Muhammad, meanwhile, broke her own world mark of 52.16 seconds in winning her speciality at the world championships in Doha in October.</p>
      <p>"It's been an amazing year," said the 29-year-old. "It's been a tough year and it's just come home excellently. I never imagined coming home with this."</p>
      <p>Muhammad is aiming to defend her Olympic 400m hurdles title next year in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Asked how she would deal with the pressure, Muhammad said: "I think the pressure comes along with the sport. (In) Tokyo I'll be able to handle it."</p>
