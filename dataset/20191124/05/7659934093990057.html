      <p>Italian coast guards on Saturday said they had rescued 149 migrants, including Arabs, off the island of Lampedsa although around 20 others were apparently missing according to the survivors.<br/><br/>A crowded boat filled with migrants capsized in wind-whipped seas, sending them tumbling into the water, said the Italian coast guard, which pulled 149 of them to safety.<br/><br/>Survivors said that around 20 of those who had been on the boat were missing.<br/><br/>Two men, an Eritrean and a Libyan, said they had been unable to locate their wives following the rescue.<br/><br/>A search for those missing continued on Saturday evening with two planes from Frontex -- the border and coast guard agency for the EU's Schengen area -- and the Italian navy flying over the area.<br/><br/>Police were also searching the Lampedusa coast to see if any of the migrants had managed to swim ashore.<br/><br/>Those rescued were taken to Lampedusa where they were allowed to disembark.<br/><br/>The coast guard said no bodies were spotted at sea during the rescue.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Italy, Germany, France and Malta jointly asked the European Commission to activate a migrant-relocation scheme for 213 migrants on board the Ocean Viking rescue ship, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said.<br/><br/>"This is the first time this has happened" since the signing of a pre-agreement for the automatic distribution of rescued migrants in the Mediterranean concluded in September in Malta by four EU countries (France, Germany, Malta and Italy).<br/><br/>The Ocean Viking, chartered by SOS Mediterranee with Doctors Without Borders, has rescued 215 people in three operations in recent days. One injured man and a pregnant woman had already been taken off the boat.</p>
