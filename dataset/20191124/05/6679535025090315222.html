      <h2>NCP MLA, supporters object to presence of policemen at Mumbai hotel; former Chief Minister Ashok Chavan accuses BJP of poaching attempts</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T05:40:22+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 05:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/The-Hindu-Net-Desk-248/" target="_blank">The Hindu Net Desk</a></address>
      <p>The government formation in Maharashtra has come under the Supreme Court's scrutiny with the Centre being asked to produce before the court on November 25 morning the letters of the Governor inviting Devendra Fadnavis as well as the communication of the BJP leader staking his claim.</p>
      <p>As the stunning political drama shifted to the apex court on November 24, a day after Mr. Fadnavis returned as the Chief Minister, the Shiv Sena claimed that the Sena-NCP-Congress combine has a support of 165 MLAs and can comfortably prove its majority in the Assembly. The BJP also claimed that Mr. Fadnavis had the support of 170 MLAs.</p>
      <p>In the assembly polls held in October, the BJP had won 105 seats, the Shiv Sena 56, the NCP 54 and the Congress 44.</p>

      <h3>Rival camps hold series of meetings in Mumbai</h3>
      <p>Top leaders of the BJP and the Congress-Shiv Sena-NCP combine held a series of separate meetings to brace themselves for an impending floor test.</p>
      <p>Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel and AICC general secretary Mallikarjun Kharge held a string of meetings with Maharashtra Congress leaders and MLAs throughout the day. Congress MLAs are staying at J W Marriott in Juhu.</p>
      <p>According to sources, Mr. Patel and Mr. Kharge coordinated with the legal team of senior Congress leaders and lawyers Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Manu Singhvi in Delhi.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray met MLAs of the NCP at Hotel Renaissance in suburban Powai along with Sharad Pawar. Mr. Thackeray also interacted with the MLAs of his party at Hotel Lalit near the Mumbai international airport, and asked them to be “cautious“.</p>
      <p>“Spread out so that you can keep a watch on who is around you,” he told the MLAs. <b><i>- PTI</i></b></p>

      <h3>NCP workers question presence of policemen at Mumbai hotel</h3>
      <p>A video of two plainclothesmen present in a Mumbai suburban hotel, where NCP MLAs are put up, being confronted by a party leader and supporters has gone viral. The video shows party MLA Jitendra Awhad and workers asking the policemen about their business in Hotel Renaissance in Powai.</p>
      <p>The legislators were moved to the hotel on the night of November 23.</p>
      <p>When Mr. Awhad asked one of the policemen the reason behind their presence at the hotel, he replied they were just “sitting there“.</p>
      <p>Mr. Awhad even examined the identity card of the official. “Such a high-ranking officer is sitting here for no reason? Do you think we are fools,” he asked further.</p>

      <h3>Congress leader Ashok Chavan accuses BJP of poaching attempts</h3>
      <p>Senior Congress leader Ashok Chavan alleged that BJP leaders had booked rooms in hotels where his party MLAs are put up and were contacting some of them.</p>
      <p>Speculation was rife that the task of getting MLAs into the BJP’s fold has been entrusted to senior leader Radhkrishna Vikhe Patil, who had crossed over from the Congress to the BJP ahead of the October Assembly polls, Sainik-turned-Congressman-turned BJP Rajya Sabha MP Narayan Rane, NCP-turned-BJP MLA Ganesh Naik and Babanrao Pachpute.</p>
      <p>When asked about the speculation, Mr. Vikhe Patil gave a cryptic and open-to-interpretation reply, stating “I have good relations with all MLAs”.</p>

      <p>Mr. Chavan told reporters that some Congress MLAs had told him about the move by the BJP.</p>
      <p>“Our MLAs are united and will not be poached,” Mr. Chavan said.</p>
      <p>MLAs of the Congress, NCP and Sena are sequestered in different hotels in the metropolis, to stall any attempts by the BJP to poach them ahead of the floor test in the Assembly.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, BJP leader Ravindra Chavan was seen entering Hotel Renaissance in suburban Powai where NCP MLAs have been staying since November 23 evening.</p>
      <p>Sources said these NCP MLAs are now being moved to another location nearby.</p>
      <p>The Congress legislators were earlier supposed to leave for Jaipur, but were later put up in Mumbai in view of the fast-paced political developments, according to sources.</p>
      <p>While the Congress MLAs are staying in J W Marriott hotel in Juhu, Shive Sena MLAs are staying at The Lalit hotel located near the Mumbai international airport.</p>
      <p>According to sources, Independent and other MLAs could tilt the scales in favour of either the BJP-led government of Mr. Fadnavis backed by Ajit Pawar or the Sena-Congress-NCP combine during the floor test. <i><b>— PTI</b></i></p>

      <p>The new-found bonhomie between the NCP and Shiv Sena was on display on November 24 after Uddhav Thackeray met Sharad Pawar at a Mumbai luxury hotel where NCP MLAs were lodged amid the high ongoing political drama in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, NCP spokesperson Clyde Crasto dubbed Mr. Sharad Pawar, the 20-year-old party’s founder, as ‘Renaissance Man’, even as Mr. Thackeray met the NCP chief at the suburban hotel bearing the same name.</p>
      <p>“Hey #BJP, Game on. Our ‘Renaissance Man’ v/s your modern day so-called ‘#Chanakya’ Bring it on,” Mr. Crasto tweeted.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, NCP leader and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he would work hard for people of the State.</p>
      <p>Responding to Ajit Pawar’s tweet, Mr. Crasto tweeted, “Dear Ajit Dada, Nice to see you reply to our Hon. PM’s good wishes but just want to remind you that you are being wished because you left the hands of the Man who held your hand &amp; taught you how to walk in your personal &amp; political life.

      <p>“There is no question of forming an alliance with @BJP4Maharashtra. NCP has unanimously decided to ally with @ShivSena &amp; @INCMaharashtra to form the government,” Mr. Sharad Pawar tweeted.</p>
      <p>“Shri Ajit Pawar’s statement is false and misleading in order to create confusion and false perception among the people,” he added. <i><b>— PTI</b></i></p>

      <p>The unprecedented hearing in the Supreme Court on November 24, on a plea by the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine against the Maharashtra Governor’s decision to invite Devendra Fadanvis to form the State government, saw politicians like ex-Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan and Randeep Surjewala in the packed courtroom to witness proceedings.</p>
      <p>A galaxy of leaders of the alliance, including former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, Shiv Sena MP Gajanan Kirtikar and NCP leader and Rajya Sabha lawmaker Majeed Memon, were seen waiting outside the courtroom much before the start of the crucial proceedings at 11.30 a.m.</p>
      <p>Despite being a Sunday, the courtroom was packed with lawyers, scribes and leaders of parties even before the hearing began. They were all trying hard to get closer to the dias to watch the proceedings.</p>
      <p>Journalists had a tough time in jotting down notes as lawyers and the leaders jostled for space in their bid to go near the dias in an already packed courtroom.</p>
      <p>Mr. Chavan and Mr. Surejewala were seen sitting on chairs earmarked for lawyers in the courtroom and they keenly watched the proceedings.</p>
      <p>On conclusion of proceedings, the leaders, flanked by lawyers, rushed to the Supreme Court lawn to give sound bytes to waiting video journalists. <i><b>— PTI</b></i></p>

      <h3>We still have a majority with 165 legislators, says Sena leader Sanjay Raut</h3>
      <p>Senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday said that November 23 was a “black Saturday” and maintained that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (the Sena, the Congress, the NCP) still had a majority with 165 legislators.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media on Sunday morning, Mr. Raut said, “[NCP chief] Sharad Pawar is a national leader, if the BJP is trying to break his party, this will boomerang on the BJP. Even before the Assembly election, there was an attempt to break the NCP when the BJP poached people from the NCP. Poaching Ajit Pawar was their last move which has boomeranged. They were expecting around 25 MLAs to support Ajit Pawar. I hope the BJP has come out of that delusion now. Nearly all the NCP MLAs have returned, barely five MLAs may have stayed, and in return of five MLAs, the BJP has given Ajit Pawar Deputy CM position? They were supposed to be good at business but now are struggling,” said Mr. Raut.</p>

      <h3>Have numbers to form government in Maharashtra: Sena-NCP-Cong combine to SC</h3>
      <p>The Shiv Sena-NCP-Cong combine on Sunday told the Supreme Court that they have the majority in the Maharashtra Assembly and if Devendra Fadnavis has the numbers he should prove majority on floor of the House.</p>
      <p>The combine also said that it was ‘betrayal and annihilation’ of democracy that government has been allowed to be formed when 41 NCP MLAs are not with the BJP.</p>
      <p>“If Devendra Fadnavis has numbers to prove majority, let him prove it on the floor of House, else we have numbers to form government in Maharashtra,” senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the combine, submitted before a bench comprising Justices N.V. Ramana, Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna.</p>
      <p>Senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, also appearing for the combine, submitted that 41 MLAs of NCP are with Sharad Pawar.</p>
      <p>While 54 is the total strength of NCP, 41 MLAs wrote to the Maharashtra Governor saying Ajit Pawar has been removed as its leader, Mr. Singhvi told the Bench.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sibal said that November 30 deadline given by the Governor to the ruling party to prove majority is meant to do ‘something else’.</p>
      <p>“It is a complete ‘betrayal and annihilation’ of democracy where government has been allowed to be formed when 41 NCP MLAs are not with them, ” they submitted.</p>
      <p>Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for some BJP and independent MLAs, said the plea filed by the combine should have been filed in Bombay High Court.</p>
      <p>The top court said none is disputing that floor test is best method to show majority.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rohatgi said how can a political party approach apex court under Article 32 for violation of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p>Mr. Singhvi refers to judgments in various cases including dismissal of Uttarakhand Congress government, saying that floor test is ultimate test.</p>
      <p>He also referred to 2018 apex court’s order in Karnataka case and said floor test was ordered and there was no secret ballot.</p>
      <p>“Floor test is Constitutional obligation, no formality is needed and it can be ordered,” Mr. Singhvi told the Bench.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rohatgi, appearing for the BJP and independent MLAs, opposed the NCP plea.</p>
      <p>“They (three parties) were given time but they did not form government, so let Fadnavis prove majority as there was no tearing hurry," Mr. Rohatgi told the Bench. <b>—<i> PTI</i></b></p>

      <h3>Sacking of Ajit Pawar as head of NCP legislative unit unconstitutional: BJP</h3>
      <p>The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has called the sacking of Ajit Pawar as the head of the legislative unit of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) unconstitutional. </p>
      <p>Mr. Pawar was removed by the NCP’s parliamentary board on Saturday following the dramatic turn of events in the State and allegations he did not have the authority to submit letters of support from NCP MLAs in support of the BJP. However, the BJP said the election of Jayant Patil replacing Mr. Pawar was unconstitutional since it did not have the approval of Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari.</p>
