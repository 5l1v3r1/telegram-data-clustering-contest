      <p>We are just hours away from <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">Survivor Series</a>, which is set to be one of the most exciting editions of the PPV in recent times. The addition of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a> to the show has spiced things up, and if NXT TakeOver: WarGames - which happened on Saturday night - is any indication, we are in for a treat!</p>
      <p>Eight matches have been announced for Survivor Series 2019, five of those inter-brand matches, while there are three intra-brand matches as well. Brock Lesnar will defend his WWE Championship against Rey Mysterio, The Fiend Bray Wyatt will put his Universal title on the line against Daniel Bryan, while Adam Cole puts his NXT Championship on the line against Pete Dunne.</p>
      <p>At a huge PPV like Survivor Series, there are bound to be some shocks and surprises that WWE have in store for us. We could possibly see a few face and heel turns on the show to keep the viewer on the edge of their seats.</p>
      <p>Let's take a look at 2 heel and 2 face turns we could see at Survivor Series 2019.</p>

      <p>Kevin Owens made a shocking return to NXT, a night before Survivor Series at NXT TakeOver: WarGames. Triple H has clarified that this does not mean that Owens is on NXT permanently, but there could be a possibility of this happening.</p>
      <p>Owens, who has switched multiple times between being a face and heel on WWE over the last year or so, needs a solid feud in the coming months to stay relevant in WWE.</p>
      <p>He will be a part of Team RAW alongside Seth Rollins, Drew McIntyre, Randy Orton, and Ricochet, when the red brand takes on Team SmackDown and Team NXT in a 5-on-5-on-5 Survivor Series triple threat elimination match.</p>
      <p>Owens, who has been a babyface over the last few months, could perhaps turn heel - once again - when he attacks his own teammates and officially joins NXT. This could be in continuation of the storyline of this past week when Triple H tried to coax Owens to join him at NXT.</p>
