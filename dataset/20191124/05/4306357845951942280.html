      <h2>Man United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer plays down Nemanja Matic's social media activity after his link to Spurs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T05:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thesportreview.com/topics/football-transfers/" target="_blank">Transfer Agent</a></address>
      <h3>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has laughed off speculation linking Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic with a move to Tottenham Hotspur.</h3>
      <p>The Serbia international was one of the first names <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10391886/mourinho-spurs-signings-matic-dias-bruno-fernandes/">linked</a> with a reunion with his former Chelsea FC and Manchester United manager at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
      <p>Matic has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford under Solskjaer, competing with Scott McTominay, Paul Pogba and Fred for a starting spot in the Red Devils team.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old fuelled reports linking the defensive midfielder with a move to Tottenham after <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7714189/Manchester-United-outcast-Matic-laps-links-suggesting-January-Spurs.html">he liked an Instagram post</a> suggesting Matic would link up with Mourinho in January.</p>
      <p>However, Solskjaer was quick to play down the significance of Matic’s social media activity ahead of Manchester United’s clash against Sheffield United on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“That’s not a part of being boring when it’s like this, you like Jose coming back it’s going be a spectacle and a circus and Nemanja has a sense of humour,” Solskjaer told his pre-match media conference on Friday.</p>
      <p>Matic was a key player under Mourinho during his second stint at Chelsea FC.</p>
      <p>The Serbian midfielder won the Premier League and the League Cup with the Portuguese head coach before Mourinho was sacked in December 2016.</p>
      <p>Matic ended up following Mourinho to Manchester United in 2017 when the 20-time English champions signed the holding midfielder in a £40m deal.</p>
      <p>However, the two-time Premier League winner has struggled to produce his best form in a Manchester United over the past two years.</p>
