      <h1>A Run Down Of The Happenings For The Week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T05:00:56+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Njideka Agbo</a></address>
      <p>This was a week of new beginnings as the tides changed for a lot of people in the public space. From attracting global attention to getting a second chance at life, here is a rundown of the week:</p>
      <p><b>Love don’t cost a thing</b><br/>It appears that on and off lovebirds, Big Sean and Jhene Aiko are back together. This is coming after a loved up photo of the duo surfaced online alongside a super personal song with a little TMI attached. The rumour was further fueled after the two entertainers were spotted at a restaurant in Malibu where they took a loved up photo of Jhene Aiko sitting Jhene on Sean’s lap as they looked out at the ocean on the restaurant’s patio deck. Before you ask questions, we’d stick with the title of their new single, <i>None of Your Concern</i>.</p>

      <p><b>Second hearing</b><br/>The two men who sued Michael Jackson’s estate and were the subject of the <i>Leaving Neverland</i> documentary are set to get their day in court to press their sexual abuse claims against the singer’s estate. Wade Robson and James Safechuck sued MJ for sexual abuse, but their lawsuits were dismissed in 2017-partly due to the statute of limitations. However, with a new ruling, Robson and Safechuck can have their cases heard before a jury. Well, we’d see what happens in court.</p>
      <p><b>Soaring higher</b><br/>Keep doing good and it’d come back to you, says the good old saying. <i>The Guardian Life</i>’s one-time cover subject Oluwaseun Ayodeji Osowobi, founder of <i>Stand to End Rape</i> (STER), became one of the three Nigerian recipients of TIME’S 2019 list of 100 rising stars shaping the future of business, entertainment, sports, politics, science, and health. Her achievement got a special mention from the former US president, Barack Obama who said he is proud to see her on the list and also recognised the <i>ObamaFoundation Leader</i> for her numerous contributions to ending sexual violence in the country.</p>
      <p><b>Keeping hope alive</b><br/>Kim Kardashian-West showed renewed interest for wrongly convicted prisoner, Rodney Reed by coming face-to-face with his brother, Rodrick Reed. Rodrick revealed he met Kim, her husband Kanye, and Joel Osteen at the Lakewood Church, where he discussed his brother’s case with Joel and the Wests. Kanye said he still plans to visit Rodney but needs to work out the legal works to make it happen. Rodney was set to be executed this week. However, the courts are ready to hear his case again, so, he could be vindicated after 20 years in prison. Fingers crossed.</p>
      <p><b>End of the road</b><br/>Following threats of violence, the highly publicised anti-xenophobia concert Africa Unite which Burna Boy was billed to headline in South Africa has been cancelled. The concert organisers Phambili Media and Play Network confirmed that after engagement with Burna Boy’s management a decision to withdraw his name from the line-up and as a result, cancel the concert.</p>
      <p>“With the increasing threats of violence from other unfortunate segments of the public and without any government intervention … the safety of all artists and attendees could not be guaranteed… The safety of all attendees, artists, and crew comes first,” a part of their statement reads.</p>
