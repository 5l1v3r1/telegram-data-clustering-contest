      <p>A COMMERCIAL train passing through a community in Abia State knocked down and ran over a yet-to-be identified woman who is suspected to be pregnant.</p>
      <p>The incident which happened along the rail line at Obuda community left residents in shock as eyewitnesses claimed it was the first time such a thing will happen in the area.</p>
      <p>The woman, whose house is said to be located some kilometres to the scene of the incident, was said to be heading for the city centre to shop for what her family would eat this weekend.</p>
      <p>The commercial motorcyclist carrying her was said to have escaped unhurt.</p>
      <p>Sources told our reporter that the husband of the deceased and her relations hurriedly came and evacuated her body to avoid the railway Police from taking custody of her remains, which may either cost the family more money before it could be released for burial.</p>
      <p>An eyewitness who gave his name as Mark told our reporter that it was shocking to watch the body of the young woman in her early or mid-forties, being dragged and decapitated by the moving train.</p>

      <p>Mark blamed the accident on the commercial motorcyclist whom many accused of reckless and dangerous driving.</p>
      <p>“I was not that far from the accident scene. I was coming from the other end of Uratta road off Port Harcourt road. Keke and other bikes parked on both sides of the road when they noticed that the train was close. Suddenly, this guy emerged from nowhere and before you could say Jack, the train was on the woman. People were saying that they overhead the woman hitting on the guy to stop.</p>
      <p>But it was too late. It was out of fear that she jumped out of the bike, but it was too late for any miracle to happen. The train dismembered her legs and ripped open her skull from the back. Early caller to the scene managed to lift up her decapitated body to see if there could be anyone that knows her.</p>
      <p>“The Okada man ran away, but I think people know him. It was alleged that he (commercial motorcyclist) was listening to music or radio using a headphone.</p>
      <p>It hasn’t been long when the husband and the relatives of the woman came to remove her body before policemen from railway cames. You know that if the railway police evacuate the body, they will find it hard to secure her body for burial,” Mark stated.</p>
      <p>Another road user who gave his name as Gilbert bemoaned reckless driving of motorists and motorcyclists after its rehabilitation the federal government.</p>
      <p>Gilbert and others however called on the railway authorities to ensure that they keep an official that will monitor traffic compliance by the motorists at the place.</p>
