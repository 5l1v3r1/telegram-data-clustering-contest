        <b>The world-class quality of Finn Russell proved a major thorn in Munster’s side at Thomond Park on Saturday night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>His sublime grubber and gather which resulted in the opening try of the game was followed in the second half by a scintillating ‘show-and-go’ as he cut through the line before offloading to the supporting Juan Imhoff for a try under the posts.</p>
      <p>That score, of course, put Racing 92 seven points ahead and it took a late Andrew Conway try and touchline conversion from JJ Hanrahan to level the game.</p>
      <p>However, what went under the radar was Russell’s awareness in generating the move.</p>
      <p>A few phases before Russell’s linebreak, Munster loosehead prop Jeremy Loughman suffered a serious lower leg injury.</p>
      <p>The man-of-the-match from last weekend’s win over the Ospreys got himself up off the ground and into the defensive line despite operating essentially on one leg. It was clear that Russell identified this and attacked the space between Loughman and Peter O’Mahony to break clear.</p>

      <p>Munster head coach Johann van Graan praised Loughman’s desire to get back into the line despite the obvious pain he was in.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, look, it’s just a game of rugby. From our point of view – the coach’s point of view – we saw he (Loughman) was in big trouble. Knowing Jeremy, like all of our players, he got up back into the defensive line. Obviously, Finn Russell is a world-class player. He spotted that and that’s just the way the game goes.</p>
      <p>“He gave it his all and unfortunately he got past him and that’s how they got their third try. You couldn’t fault Jeremy for it, considering his ankle was gone and he still got back up. The easy choice is to stay down, but he got back up. Incredibly frustrating that that led to seven points but that’s just the way rugby goes.</p>

      <p>“But big credit to him for getting up and trying to hold the line. Massive moment in the game because we had just got back in the game. It was 14 all, if I’m not mistaken, and they just went immediately to 21-14 and we had to find our way back again.”</p>
      <p>Munster now have a major worry at loosehead with Loughman set for a spell on the sidelines and Dave Kilcoyne still recovering from a calf injury he picked up during training.</p>
      <p>“Killer is still a way to go. It’s strange how injuries happen in certain positions. That’s just the way that rugby goes. It’s backing our squad and whoever will be the next man up. I don’t want to start speculating as to how serious it is but the fact that we had to carry him off the field seems like it is pretty serious.</p>
      <p>“We’ll take our time and see on Monday what we’ve got. Unfortunately, Killer is still a few weeks away so we just have to see where we’re at and regroup again for Edinburgh.”</p>
