      <h1>Billie Eilish Says She Absolutely Didn’t Snub Her Fans After ‘Jimmy Kimmel’ In Instagram Rant</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T01:20:38+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 01:20</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Story</a></address>
      <p>Pop superstar Billie Eilish has clapped back at paparazzi and so-called “eBayers” who she says booed her after her appearance on <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i> on Friday.</p>
      <p>Responding to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsuXJ7i2FE&amp;feature=emb_title">a video that’s been circulating</a> since the incident, in which Eilish appears to be ignoring <a href="https://junkee.com/lizzo-billie-eilish-mean-tweets/230182">her screaming fans</a>, she posted a series of Instagram Stories on Saturday.</p>
      <p>She described how there was a group of fans to her left, and who she thought were fans and paparazzi on her right. She went to speak to the people on her left: “I walked all the way over to them and I hugged them all, I did pictures, I talked to them for a second…”</p>

      <p>Then she went over to the right side, to people who were cheering and shouting her name. “As I got closer, I realised that it was pretty much all paparazzi and eBayers, which is what we call people that just take my signature and sell it and couldn’t give less of a fuck about me at all.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t want to be disrespectful at all so I went up to them all, and I tried to get hugs or I tried to touch all their hands, go down the line, you know, whatever. I started to do that and nobody put their hands out and nobody tried to hug me back. I hugged one girl at the end, she was really sweet.”</p>

      <p>Eilish explained in the video that she doesn’t like to sign autographs – because she often finds that those signatures are then sold back to her actual fans online. She’ll do it for people she reckons are real fans – “for a special occasion or if somebody’s in need” – but for Eilish, it’s most important she be present.</p>
      <p>“I have this whole thing about not signing things because I just wanna be there. I’d way rather get a hug and talk to you than take a picture with you and fuckin’ sign something so you can sell that shit.”</p>
      <p>When Eilish walked away from the paps and people looking for autographs, the crowd started to boo her, apparently calling her a “little bitch”, saying she was going to lose her Grammy nominations, and that “Lorde would’ve stopped”.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, Eilish went back to the group of fans on her left. “I was like, ‘You guys, they booed me!’ and they were very sweet. You guys are my friends. I love you a lot.”</p>

      <p>In her videos, Billie Eilish pointed out that she is a 17-year-old girl being jeered at by grown men. “I turned around ready to fuckin’ pounce and then I got told to just ignore it and not give a reaction, which is probably good. It’s probably stupid that I’m making these videos…”</p>
      <p>She ended her callout with a message to the adult men who cursed her for not signing autographs.</p>
      <p>“To the grown men that booed me and called me a ‘little bitch’, I hope the best for you. I hope you can find someone else that you can use to make money off of and belittle. All the best. Love you paparazzi.”</p>
