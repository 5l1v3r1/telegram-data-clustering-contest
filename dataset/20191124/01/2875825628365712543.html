      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T01:31:17+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 01:31</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Britain's richest man Sir Jim Ratcliffe has explained why he won't buy <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , the club he grew up supporting.</p>
      <p>Ratcliffe, 67, is worth a reported £20billion thanks to the success of his multi-national chemicals company, Ineos.</p>
      <p>He used some of his wealth to purchase French club Nice for €110m in August, while he has also looked into the possibility of taking over several English teams including <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> , Newcastle and Leeds.</p>
      <p>His company also provides financial backing for cycling's Team Ineos, after broadcaster Sky decided not to renew their sponsorship.</p>
      <p>But Ratcliffe says he would not be interested in buying United from unpopular owners the Glazer family, saying it would not make good business sense.</p>

      <p>Asked whether he would be interested in a move for United, Ratcliffe told the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/sport/sir-jim-ratcliffe-buy-a-premier-league-club-for-billions-ill-never-be-the-dumb-money-8ts7k5mz3">Times</a> : "Not at the moment, no. They are in quite a big pickle as a business.</p>
      <p>"(Ineos) never wants to be the dumb money in town, never, never."</p>
      <p>He said United have made poor decisions - and insisted that in any case he would want to test the water at Nice before making a move for a big Premier League club.</p>
      <p>"They haven't got the manager selection right, haven't bought well," Ratcliffe said of United. "They have been the dumb money, which you see with players like Fred.</p>

      <p>"We won't look elsewhere until we have had a good run here (at Nice). We need to find out how to be successful before you ever want to write a big cheque. It's quite difficult."</p>
      <p>He added that United have "lost the plot" since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.</p>
      <p>"United have spent an immense amount since Ferguson left and been poor, to put it mildly. Shockingly poor, to be honest," Ratcliffe said.</p>
      <p>"We have a different approach here to be moderately intelligent about it. Try to do it more grass roots, trying to locate young talent.</p>

      <p>"Some clubs seem to have an ability to do that, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> , Lille. United have done it really poorly. They have lost the plot there somehow."</p>
      <p>With big six Premier League clubs valued at £2bn-plus, Ratcliffe said the costs would be "stratospheric" - particularly in the case of Chelsea which would involve potentially four years of stadium reconstruction.</p>
      <p>“So you quickly get into some pretty stratospheric numbers,” he said.</p>
      <p>“And even though clubs have those valuations today, nobody has ever paid those amounts of money.</p>
      <p>"How much did Abramovich pay for Chelsea, £100 million? The Glazers [at United], what £500 million? You can say it’s worth three, four billion but no one has ever paid those sums.</p>
      <p>“Ineos has always tried to take a sensible approach. We don’t like squandering money or we wouldn’t be where we are today. It’s part of our DNA, trying to spend sensibly.”</p>
