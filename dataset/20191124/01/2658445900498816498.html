      <p>THE National President Association of Bureau De Change Operators of Nigeria, Alhaji Aminu Gwadabe has stated that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have not helped any country to achieve the needed development.</p>
      <p>Gwadabe, therefore called on Nigerians, especially those in the diaspora and the relevant stakeholders to take to divestment, stating that if Nigerians fail to invest and develop the country that no foreigner would do it.</p>
      <p>The ABCON boss gave this insight while speaking to The Nation, he said that the country stands the opportunity of earning billions of Dollars annually from the export of dried fish.</p>
      <p>“As the Managing Director of Ashante smoked fish, I am encouraged in terms of policies that are now pushing Nigerians to go into multiple streams of income. I belong to a business that is more or less a traditional business, ‘bureau de change’ business whereby we hardly want to look into another sector of business.</p>
      <p>“But with the consistent government awareness, especially in terms of diversification, export drive and as ex-banker and as an economist, I looked at it and found out that it is what doing, because the IMF and the World Bank has not changed any country. So, it is Nigerians that will change our own country. We can only change our own country by acting, we must do something. Enough of the talk, let’s work the talk. So, in doing that, I diversified into fish farming, to align with government calls for Nigerians to go into private investment to develop the local industry. So I went into fish farming and fish processing,” Gwadabe expressed.</p>
