      <p>The Chairman, Kakanfo Inn and Conference Centre, Dr Lalekan Are, was among other dignitaries that graced the 80 years thanksgiving service and luncheon in honour of a former Deputy Director of the Africa Project Management Division, International Fund for Agricultural Development, Dr Adebisi Olowude.</p>
      <p>Olowude clocked 80 on November 11.</p>
      <p>Are, who chaired the occasion, described the host as a “young old man, loyal friend, upright and blessing to humanity.”</p>
      <p>“He is a very determined achiever, very generous to a fault. One of the best agriculturists in Africa,” he added.</p>
      <p>Are said when Olowude was in Rome, Italy, working as a Project Controller in the Africa Division of IFAD, an agency of the United Nations, he displayed exemplary performance and rose through the ranks to become a deputy director.</p>
      <p>“He brought a lot of reforms and initiatives to help countries and individuals be the best they could be in their fields,” he said.</p>
      <p>The host thanked Are, family, friends and associates for celebrating him on his 80th birthday.</p>
      <p>Dignitaries who graced the occasion included Are’s wife, Bisi; host’s wife, Adefunke; Rev Lowo Mamadelo; Rev Mayowa Ojuade; Rev Julius Okanlowo; and Mrs Yemisi Olateru-Olagbegi (née Olowude).</p>
