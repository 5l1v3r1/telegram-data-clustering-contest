      <p>First responders said the victims were a woman and two children, according to the <a href="https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20191123/woman-two-children-dead-after-collision-with-amtrak-train-at-jw-corbett-wildlife-area">Palm Beach Post.</a> The crash occurred near the entrance of the Corbett Wildlife Management Area in Jupiter, located in northern Palm Beach County, the <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/palm-beach/fl-ne-train-crash-20191123-y6e4y7jv4rbkndaesymom3xhgq-story.html">Sun-Sentinel </a>reported.</p>
      <p>The woman was driving a Subaru Outback that contained camping equipment, <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/west-palm-beach/three-people-killed-in-train-vs-vehicle-crash-in-jupiter">WPTV</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The railroad crossing had no gate and the tracks were 25 yards from the turnoff of a main highway, the <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/palm-beach/fl-ne-train-crash-20191123-y6e4y7jv4rbkndaesymom3xhgq-story.html">Sun-Sentinel</a> reported. There was a yield sign and two railroad markers, but brush near the crossing obstructed the view of drivers, the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>There were no injuries to any of the 200 passengers or crew inside the train, Christina E. Leeds, senior director of public relations for Amtrak, told <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/west-palm-beach/three-people-killed-in-train-vs-vehicle-crash-in-jupiter">WPTV</a>. The Silver Meteor Train 97 was heading from New York to Miami when the 2 p.m. crash occurred, Amtrak officials said.</p>

      <p>The crash pushed the SUV about a half-mile before the train stopped.</p>
      <p>“It sounded like a shotgun going off,” Earl Megonigal, a check station operator at the wildlife management area, told the <a href="https://palmbeachpost.com/news/20191123/woman-two-children-dead-after-collision-with-amtrak-train-at-jw-corbett-wildlife-area">Post</a>. “Then we heard the train stopping and ran up there and saw all the car parts.”</p>
