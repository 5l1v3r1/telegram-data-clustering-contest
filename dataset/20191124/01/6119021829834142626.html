      <h2>Monkey who went viral online, has millions of fans, but is unlucky in love because of his aggressive behaviour</h2>

      <p>A monket's human-like face has allegedly been putting off would-be lovers. The 19-year-old primate has become an attraction at the Tianjin Zoo in eastern China since footage in which he was seen to resemble an angry human man, went viral.</p>

      <p>But fame has failed to bolster his love life. He has come to be known as a lifelong "bachelor" among his keepers. The unnamed monkey, a member of a subspecies known as the Margarita Island Capuchin, hasn't yet found a partner because of a "lack of fate". "He currently has three playmates," a zoo spokesperson told MailOnline. "We bought three other Margarita Island Capuchins in 2016, but none of them is sexually mature yet. When the younger Capuchin monkeys grow up, we hope there will be chemistry between our human-faced monkey and one of them and he can finally find have a 'wife'." He previously had two female companions, but both died.</p>
      <p>The monkey reportedly also lacks interpersonal skills, and exhibits an "aggressive" personality, which could apparently be the reason why female monkeys keep away from him. "He is very active and aggressive," a zoo spokesperson said. "[He] likes playing with mud and smashing coconuts."</p>

      <p>Break-ups can be hard, and these days, it also means cleansing social media of old photos that might remind you of your ex. But a young woman named Rosie from Singapore, who goes by the handle @im.hongry on Instagram, decided she wasn't going to give up on her cute photos yet. Instead, she found a fun solution: Rosie merely updated each of the pictures with more honest, biting captions on Instagram. The funny move has now gone viral.</p>

      <p>A Chinese woman whose violent coughs reportedly resulted in 10 fractured ribs was shocked to hear that her bones had become fragile due to excessive sunblock use, which caused a severe vitamin D deficiency. The 20-year-old woman from Zhejiang province, in eastern China, recently visited the doctor, when she started experiencing severe pain in the left side of her chest, after excessive bouts of coughing. An X-ray revealed that she had <br/>several broken ribs.</p>
      <p>On further investigation, doctors found out that she had significantly lower bone density and vitamin D deficiency. They later told the media that her daily cosmetic habit was most likely the cause of her fractures. To prevent getting tanned, the woman would stay indoors and used SPF50 sunscreen all year round.</p>

      <p>A group of secondary school students in the Philippines has found a way to convert stray dog poop into a mixture for bricks, aiming to rid city streets of excrement and potentially even lower construction costs. As part of a research project, eighth-graders in the Payatas district, north of the capital Manila, gathered and air-dried dog faeces, which was then mixed with cement powder and moulded into rectangular "bio bricks." The bricks can be used for sidewalk pavements.</p>
