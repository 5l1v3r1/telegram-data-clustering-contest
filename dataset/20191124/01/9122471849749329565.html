      <h1>Wisconsin Linebacker Has A Message For Minnesota</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T01:37:16+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 01:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Wisconsin and Minnesota are gearing up for a massive Big Ten contest next Saturday. The winner will claim the Big Ten West Division and play Ohio State in the Big Ten title game. It’s safe to say this will be one of the biggest games of the season.</p>
      <p>In last year’s contest between the Badgers and Golden Gophers, Minnesota claimed ‘Paul Bunyan’s Axe’ – the trophy awarded to the game’s winner. PJ Fleck’s team came away with a big 37-15 victory at Camp Randall Stadium. It helped the Golden Gophers claim their sixth win, earning bowl eligibility in the final contest of the regular season.</p>
      <p>Next Saturday’s contest between the two teams carries much heavier implications. But Wisconsin hasn’t forgotten about their defeat at the hands of Minnesota in 2018. In fact, Badgers linebacker Chris Orr has revenge on the mind heading into next week’s game.</p>
      <p>After Wisconsin’s victory over Purdue on Saturday, Orr had a message for Minnesota: “We’re going to get our axe back.”</p>

      <p>Wisconsin is clearly looking forward to facing Minnesota on the road. The Golden Gophers must be careful against a Badgers team seeking revenge. This will be a game to watch next Saturday.</p>
      <p>Will the Badgers reclaim Paul Bunyan’s Axe?</p>
