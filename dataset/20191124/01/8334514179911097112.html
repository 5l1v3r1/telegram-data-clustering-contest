      <p>LIMA (Reuters) - Both chambers of Bolivia’s Congress unanimously passed legislation on Saturday to annul the contested Oct. 20 elections and pave the way for a new vote without former president Evo Morales, a breakthrough in the political crisis.</p>
      <p>Interim President Jeanine Anez, a former senator and opponent of Morales, has indicated that she will sign the law so it can go into effect, though it was not clear when.</p>
      <p>Passage of the bill comes as anti-government demonstrators lifted road blockades to hold talks with Anez aimed at ending weeks of unrest that have left more than 30 dead in clashes with security forces.</p>
