      <h1>Video Of Shaq With LSU’s Cheerleaders Is Going Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T01:13:53+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 01:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>One of the greatest (and biggest) athletes in the history of LSU athletics is back in Baton Rouge, La. this evening. Shaq is at Tiger Stadium.</p>
      <p>The former LSU basketball star turned NBA legend pumped up the crowd at Tiger Stadium during tonight’s game vs. Arkansas.</p>
      <p>O’Neal then had some fun with LSU’s cheerleaders.</p>
      <p>The former NBA star lifted an LSU cheerleader over his head with ease, because of course he did:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>That’s a 47-year-old man lifting a 100-something pound person over his head like it was nothing.</p>
      <p>LSU’s football team appears to have responded to the pumping up, too. The Tigers are now leading Arkansas, 21-3.</p>
      <p>The game is on ESPN.</p>
