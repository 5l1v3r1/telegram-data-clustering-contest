      <p><b>Oxygen, because everyone needs it! </b>Ok, so you probably have some questions right off the bat here don't you? Since when is this a gift guide for grandma? Well it just so happens that the good old O2 can be super helpful for a variety of things besides keeping old people afloat. It's great to have on hand for marathon beer pong games for example, or high altitude activities like snowboarding or hiking, because you know, the air is thinner up there. This is the perfect gift for someone that is training, has trouble with altitude, drinks a lot or just needs a pick me up. Boost Oxygen comes in three sizes and five flavors: plain, peppermint, menthol, pink grapefruit and the new Think Tank edition. We've tried it for several different things and it's definitely put a pep in our step, especially after a long night - this is the perfect chaser for your quad latte. This will be one of the cooler and more unique gifts that lands in the stockings this year. MSRP $8-$15</p>

      <p><b>Socks in stockings, why not?</b> Yes, we get the irony of putting a sock on the stocking stuffer list, but hey, who doesn't love cool wool socks? Smartwool makes the perfect selection for those chilly days, whether you are in the city or heading to some perfect little mountain town - these will keep your tootsies warm and stylish. The wool keeps your feet from sweating too much and also helps repel any odor, which is extra nice if you've been hiking around a bit. Built to last, lots of great patterns and perfect for him or her - you can pick up a 3x pack for $60 MSRP. </p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Yes, Gypsy Cream!</b> Ok, so the name is weird and it looks like something you might find at your local farmers market, but trust us, this is stuff is the real deal. Originally developed as a treatment for psoriasis this cream proved to be so good that word spread (amongst the Gypsies we guess?) and people started using this miracle mud for all sorts of stuff from moisturizing to anti-aging, this jar is worth every penny. We used it here in Colorado this fall and it helped to keep our faces from turning to red leather.</p>
      <p>Is it the magic of Montana Mineral Water (known to have the second highest trace mineral content in the world!) combined with Hemp Seed (not to be confused with CBD) for the ultimate skin soothing? Whatever it is, this cream will be well received by any lotion junky to help them through harsh winters or setting back the clock. It's natural too, so no weird chemicals or additives - your vegan friends will REALLY love it. MSRP $29.95   </p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>The ultimate relief for sore muscles, hangovers and anxiety!</b> Yes, we all know CBD is being hailed as the cure all miracle but there is a damn good reason for that, this stuff works. The biggest issue is that most people take it in too low of a dosage for it to have much of an effect, so the geniuses at Receptra Naturals created their <a href="https://receptranaturals.com/product/receptra-plus-cbd-oil/">Plus</a> and <a href="https://receptranaturals.com/product/receptra-pro-cbd-oil/">Pro</a> lines at 1,500 mg and 2000 mg quantities to fix that. These are perfect for people that like to party and need some day after relief, weekend warriors that over do it, and those nervous types that need to take the edge off of life. If you gift this miracle product, make sure to tell those you gift to take it slow and ease into the dosage that's right for them, as we are all different in our needs. We tested out both varieties and they are some of the best CBD products we have ever tested. MSRP 30mL of Pro $149.00 | 30mL of Plus $134.95</p>
