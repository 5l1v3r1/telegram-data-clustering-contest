      <h1>Biden reveals four women he could pick as his running mate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T01:56:05+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 01:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/marina-pitofsky" target="_blank">Marina Pitofsky</a></address>
      <p>White House hopeful former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> identified four women he could name as his pick for vice president if he wins the Democratic nomination.</p>
      <p>At a town hall Friday night, Biden was asked about his pick, and he joked back to the questioner, “You. Are you available?” <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/11/23/joe-biden-possible-vice-president-stacey-abrams-sally-yates/4284126002/">USA Today reported.</a></p>
      <p>Biden did not provide any specific names, but he said several people are qualified, including "the former assistant attorney general who got fired," referring to former Deputy Attorney General <a href="https://thehill.com/people/sally-yates">Sally Yates</a>; "the woman who should have been the governor of Georgia," referring to Stacey Abrams; and "the two senators from the state of New Hampshire," referring to Sens. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/jeanne-shaheen">Jeanne Shaheen</a> (D) and <a href="https://thehill.com/people/margaret-maggie-hassan">Maggie Hassan</a> (D).</p>
      <p>Yates was fired by <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> in 2017 after refusing to to defend his administration's travel ban. She was serving as the acting attorney general at the time. </p>
      <p>Abrams, a former Georgia state lawmaker, came close to defeating Republican Brian Kemp for the Georgia governor’s seat in 2018. She said in a speech at the University of Iowa earlier this month that she would be <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news-campaigns/469220-stacey-abrams-id-be-happy-to-run-as-vice-presidential">“happy” to run as a vice presidential candidate</a>.</p>
      <p>Biden also discussed his time serving as former President Obama’s vice president. He said the most important factor is picking a running mate who aligns with you “philosophically,” USA Today reported.</p>
      <p>"We were philosophically in agreement and we strategically agreed on everything. We disagreed on tactics sometimes. And a vice president cannot be in a position even in a cabinet meeting where he or she is taking on the president," Biden said.</p>
      <p>"We’ve had arguments, we’ve shouted at each other in private, but we always completely trusted each other," he added.</p>
