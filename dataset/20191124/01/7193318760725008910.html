      <p>Jeenyus Entertainment Productions, in association with the Oklahoma Film + Music Office, has announced the completion of principal photography on the feature film “Birdie” after filming in many northeastern Oklahoma locations, including Eufaula, Morris, Beggs, Boynton, Okmulgee and Broken Arrow.</p>
      <p>Directed by award-winning actor/director Gregory Alan Williams (“Remember the Titans”), “Birdie” tells the story of love, loss and retribution woven into the fabric of a broken family. “Birdie," written by Wendi Foy Green and Austin James, and scripted by Cameron Johann, is a faith- and family-based movie shining a light on the powerful theme of grace and second chances, according to a news release.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma native LaRonn Marzett stars as Luke Bellamy, a recently released prisoner who is focused on doing everything in his power to begin a relationship with the daughter he desperately wants to know. Newcomer Kyrie McAlpin plays the role of Luke’s 8-year-old daughter, Addie.</p>
      <p>Alongside Marzett and McAlpin, Victoria Rowell (“The Young and the Restless”), Terry Serpico (“Army Wives”) and Gatlin Kate James (“Heroes Reborn”) add their performances.</p>
      <p>Green, an executive producer as well as writer on the film, wanted to lens the project in Oklahoma because of her own family ties and a love of the area, according to the news release.</p>
      <p>“The competitive incentives that are offered in Oklahoma were really the icing on the cake,” Green said in a statement. “I knew I wanted to film here, but I had no idea just how wonderful the people of Oklahoma could be. We were blown away by the hospitality of everyone from the Chief of Police, town mayors, school administrators to post office workers. Everywhere we went, people went out of their way to help us.”</p>
      <p>Using the Oklahoma Film Enhancement Rebate Program administered by Oklahoma Film + Music Office, principal photography began on Aug. 19.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a pleasure working with the ‘Birdie’ production team,” said Oklahoma Film + Music Office Director Tava Maloy Sofsky in a statement. “We are so lucky to have a variety of film-friendly cities across the state, and we are proud of the hospitality that Oklahomans consistently show to incoming films. We look forward to seeing the beauty of northeastern Oklahoma reflected in the film.”</p>
      <p>Founded in Los Angeles, California, by Green, James and Cooper Green, Jeenyus Entertainment is a relatively new company that has already sold multiple projects into worldwide distribution, including their web series “Roommates” and their first feature film, “Emerson Heights.”</p>
