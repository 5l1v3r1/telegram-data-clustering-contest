      <h1>This draft prospect battled shin splints in 2019. It won’t stop him being a 1st round pick</h1>

      <h3>Miles Bergman hardly trained in 2019.</h3>
      <p>And it makes his season even more astounding as the Sandringham Dragons product rose up AFL club’s draft boards throughout the latter stages of the year.</p>
      <p>As all 18 clubs convene on Marvel Stadium this week for the 2019 national draft, Bergman’s name is one firmly on the radar of clubs with the Western Bulldogs among the teams considering calling out the young guns name.</p>

      <p>With glimpses throughout all four games for Vic Metro during the coveted Under 18 Championships, Bergman enhanced his stocks throughout the season as he pushed his first round credentials – and it certainly hasn’t panned out how the 18-year-old expected.</p>
      <p>“(This year has been) very different. Obviously at the start of the year I wasn’t as confident, I started real slow because I’d been in and out with foot injuries,” he explained to <a href="http://foxfooty.com.au/">foxfooty.com.au</a>.</p>
      <p>“I went to the podiatrist and got my feet fixed and then coming into the pre-season I was trying to catch up to everyone so I was doing a lot of training and extras.</p>
      <p>“But then that gave me shin splints and had to take more time off. I came back for Round 1 and played limited time there and just got back into things.”</p>

      <p>AFL recruiters will look at the upside Bergman provides, given he was able to influence games – such as his four goal haul against Geelong – despite his lack of training time throughout 2019.</p>
      <p>“I was pretty much not training (for the second-half of the year), (I was) pretty much on a bike in the gym watching everyone train,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Coming back from the carnival, it was pretty much no training and playing on the weekend. Over time, (my) fitness dropped a bit, I could definitely start to feel it as I was dropping off towards the end of games. I feel like that’s why I started playing deep forward.”</p>
      <p>The pain of the shin splints were clear as Bergman pushed himself to the limit at the draft combine, where he was in agonising pain during the Yo-Yo test, going for one more level even after clutching at his legs in severe distress.</p>

      <p>Despite the injury concern, the growing confidence after Bergman’s “surprise” Vic Metro inclusion was clear, as the utility begun to take the game on and show skills previously not seen.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t really expect it. I felt more confident and felt like I was starting to fit in,” he said of his inclusion.</p>
      <p>“When I played all four games I realised I was good enough. I guess I just took that back to the club and was more confident and tried to bring more leadership and character for the rest of the season.”</p>
