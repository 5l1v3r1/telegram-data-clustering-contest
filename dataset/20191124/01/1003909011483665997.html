      <p>From the plane and right to the pitch.</p>
      <p>That’s the kind of afternoon Keith Urban had Saturday as he prepared for a night of rehearsals — and relaxation — prior to playing Sunday’s Grey Cup halftime show.</p>
      <p>“Well, what time is it?” said Urban, laughing and gesturing to his watch, when asked how long he’s been in Calgary for.</p>
      <p>“We got here a few hours ago. We’re going to be rehearsing quite a bit tonight, so I think that’s going to take us through then this evening, I don’t know. We’ll go out and see the sites of Calgary, I don’t know what we’re going to do — it might be nice and quiet.”</p>
      <p>Dozens of reporters and camera crews flocked to greet the Nashville-based, New Zealand-born, and Australian-raised country superstar Saturday afternoon during a brief media availability ahead of his pre-show preparations.</p>
      <p>Urban admitted he doesn’t really know much about the Canadian Football League, but that wasn’t going to put a damper on what he expects will be a great halftime show. And while he doesn’t know what to expect on the 101-metre long field, he does know what to expect from the crowd.</p>
      <p>“I always come out (with the idea) everyone is standing there doing this,” said Urban as he crossed his arms, “going ‘alright what do you do, what’s your business?’ And my job is to get them to this,” added Urban as he unfurled his arms pumping a fist in the air.</p>
      <p>“But I got 12 minutes to do it in.”</p>

      <p>“I’m not used to playing outside but I’m looking forward to it. I was expecting (the weather) to be way worse — if it’s like this tomorrow night, we’ll be good.”</p>
      <p>And for Urban, his roots in the city go back to the late ’90s when he toured small Calgary clubs.</p>
      <p>“(Calgary) feels like a second home, Canada in general. Because I started touring here so early in my career … I can tell from when we started playing little clubs that what I was doing, everybody got it. I felt like I was back in Australia.”</p>
      <p>Fans, meanwhile, can expect a high-energy show from Urban.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully a high-energy show — we want to keep everybody up, warm and motivating with hopefully songs almost everybody knows.”</p>
