      <p>A woman and two children were reported dead in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida">Florida</a> on Saturday after an Amtrak passenger train traveling from Miami to New York City struck a vehicle on Saturday, authorities said.</p>

      <p>All three victims were occupants of the vehicle, which was heavily damaged. None of the train’s 200 passengers were injured or killed, according to authorities.</p>
      <p>The woman and children were going camping when their Subaru SUV was struck by the train near the Corbett Wildlife Area, according to the <a href="https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20191123/woman-two-children-dead-after-collision-with-amtrak-train-at-jw-corbett-wildlife-area">Palm Beach Post</a>. The park is located northwest of West Palm Beach and east of Lake Okeechobee.</p>
      <p>Camping gear and the Subaru's bumpers were strewn along the side of the tracks when first responders arrived.</p>
      <p>The crash occurred around 2 p.m. Saturday in Indiantown, about 38 miles from West Palm Beach. The impact of the train pushed the SUV about a half-mile before it came to a stop.</p>
      <p>Around 9 p.m., Amtrak tweeted that the train had resumed its journey after a delay of about 3 hours and 45 minutes.</p>

      <p>The railroad crossing had no gate and the tracks were just about 25 yards from the turn off the highway. There were two railroad markers and a yield sign, but brush had overgrown to shield them from visibility for drivers entering Corbett, according to the Palm Beach Post.</p>
      <p>Earl Megonigal, a check station operator at the wildlife management area, said previous crashes with trains at the Corbett crossing have prompted calls for safety measures.</p>
      <p>“Everybody has been saying for years we need some sort of crossing gate,” he told the outlet.” It’s dangerous there. Trains come flying by. ”</p>
