      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 24 — Los Angeles guard Rajon Rondo was fined US$35,000 (RM146,000) by the NBA yesterday, a day after he was ejected from the Lakers' 130-127 NBA win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>
      <p>Rondo was fined for “unsportsmanlike physical contact” with Dennis Schroder after aiming a kick at the Thunder guard's groin and for verbal abuse of a game official, and failing to leave the court in a timely manner upon his ejection,” NBA vice president Kiki VanDeWeghe said.</p>
      <p>Rondo was charged with a flagrant-2 foul against Schroder and tossed in the fourth quarter. The two had exchanged words earlier in an incident that saw both assessed technical fouls.</p>
      <p>In other disciplinary action yesterday, Los Angeles Clippers guard Patrick Beverley was slapped with a US$5,000 fine for flopping during his team's win over Houston.</p>
      <p>Beverley was adjudged to have flopped — falling or stumbling over in an attempt to draw a foul despite minimal physical contact — as he guarded James Harden early in the first quarter of Friday's clash.</p>
      <p>It is the second time this season Beverley has been found in violation of the NBA's anti-flopping rules, triggering an automatic US$5,000 fine.</p>
      <p>Beverley had earlier been warned about play-acting in Wednesday's win over the Boston Celtics.</p>
      <p>In that game Beverley collapsed to the court after Celtics ace Jayson Tatum brushed against him as he attempted a three-pointer. — Reuters</p>
