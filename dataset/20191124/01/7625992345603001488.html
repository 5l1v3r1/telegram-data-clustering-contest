      <h1>Ruth Bader Ginsburg "home and doing well" after hospitalization for chills and fever</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T01:59:55+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 01:59</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Freiman</a></address>
      <p>Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was released from the hospital Sunday, two days after being hospitalized for experiencing chills and fever. The 86-year-old justice received treatment at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
      <p>"Justice Ginsburg has been discharged from the hospital," Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said in a statement. "She is home and doing well."</p>
      <p>Ginsburg, 86, was initially brought to Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., on Friday. She was then transferred to Johns Hopkins for further evaluation and treatment for a possible infection.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court's public information office said Saturday that Ginsburg's symptoms had "abated" after she received "intravenous antibiotics and fluids."</p>
      <p>Recently, Ginsburg missed arguments on November 13 with what the court called a stomach bug. She returned on November 18 for the court's next public meeting.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg has been treated for cancer twice in the past year. In August, she underwent a three-week course of radiation for a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-completes-radiation-therapy-tumor-pancreatic-cancer-treatment-2019-08-23/">tumor on her pancreas</a>. The tumor was treated "definitively," according to the public information office, and there was no sign the disease had spread.</p>
      <p>Last December, she underwent surgery for <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ruth-bader-ginsburgs-recovery-on-track/">lung cancer</a>.Â </p>
      <p>"Post-surgery evaluation indicates no evidence of remaining disease, and no further treatment is required," a spokesperson for the Supreme Court said a few weeks later.</p>
