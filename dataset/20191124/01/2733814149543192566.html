      <h1>Tesla's Cybertruck Will Have Solar Charging Options</h1>

      <p>An anonymous reader quotes CNET's Roadshow: <i>The Tesla Cybertruck <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-will-get-built-in-solar-charging-option-elon-musk-says/">will have a solar charging option that can extend its driving range</a> 15 miles a day, Chief Executive Elon Musk said Friday. On top of that, "fold-out solar wings" could increase that extra range to 30 to 40 miles per day, he said. <br/><br/>"Would love this to be self-powered," Musk tweeted of the Cybertruck solar charging option, adding that the average car in the United States travels 30 miles per day...<br/><br/>Photovoltaic panels to charge car batteries haven't been a big deal on cars so far, since they require a lot of surface area to generate significant power, and even small, aerodynamic electric vehicles demand a lot of that power. However, solar panel efficiency has been gradually increasing, the Cybertruck has a lot of surface area and the photovoltaic industry has been advancing solar cells that can be built into transparent glass -- just the thing for a transparent Cybertruck roof. <br/><br/>Solar charging could also be a nice way for Tesla to make Cybertrucks more profitable. </i><br/>TechCrunch notes that the trucks will be made from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/22/teslas-cybertruck-is-made-of-the-same-stainless-steel-alloy-that-spacex-is-using-for-starship/">the same stainless steel alloy that SpaceX is using for its Starship</a> -- and that Tesla received 146,000 reservations for the vehicle <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/23/tesla-cybertruck-reservations-hit-146000/">in just the first two days since its announcement</a>. "Of those, 41% picked the most expensive tri-motor option and 42% of future customers chose the dual motor version. The remaining 17% picked the cheapest single-motor model."</p>
