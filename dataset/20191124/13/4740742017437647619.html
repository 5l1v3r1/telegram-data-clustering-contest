      <h1>Princess Beatrice 'crying every day' after Prince Andrew's Newsnight interview</h1>
      <h2>The Duke of York's daughter reportedly helped set up the disastrous interview</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:47:21+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:47</time> by <a rel="author">Tiffany Lo, Alexander Brock</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/royal-family">Princess Beatrice</a> has reportedly been left distraught after helping her father Prince Andrew set up his <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/prince-charles-stern-words-prince-3570945">disastrous Newsnight interview</a>, royal insiders have claimed.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York discussed his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bbc">BBC</a> interview and has since faced a barrage of criticism.</p>
      <p>The prince confirmed last week that he would step back from public duties as the scandal threatened to engulf the royal family, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/princess-beatrice-set-up-prince-20948658">Mirror Online reports</a>.</p>
      <p>It's claimed his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, pushed for Andrew to go ahead with the interview to end speculation ahead of Beatrice's wedding next year.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7718663/Princess-Beatrice-helped-set-father-Prince-Andrews-car-crash-BBC-interview.html">Mail on Sunday</a> reports that Beatrice, 31, and her father met with Emily Maitlis and the Newsnight team three days before the interview.</p>

      <p>A source said: "Sarah [Ferguson] was abroad so Beatrice sat in on the discussions. Initially, Beatrice was sceptical that a television interview, which would inevitably delve into her father's private life, was such a good idea.</p>
      <p>"She was asking lots of pertinent questions and had her doubts.</p>
      <p>"But by the end of the meeting she was convinced by the Newsnight team and Amanda Thirsk [Duke's then-private secretary] that they had no choice - that it was the only way to put all the rumours behind them."</p>
      <p>"Both Sarah and Andrew rely on Beatrice's judgement a lot when it comes to dealing with the public as she's got an old head on young shoulders.</p>
      <p>"You can't really blame Beatrice because I think the odds were stacked against her on this one.</p>
      <p>"Andrew, Fergie and Amanda decided they had to do it."</p>
      <p>The source added that Beatrice has been crying "every day" since the interview aired.</p>
      <p>They said: "Beatrice was sombre and make-up-free for the birthday dinner.</p>
      <p>"She seemed quite tearful at times. In fact, Beatrice has been in tears every day since the interview went out."</p>
