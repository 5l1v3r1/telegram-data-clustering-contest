      <p>Ukrainian diplomats have called on The Economist to use a map with Ukraine's Crimea.</p>
      <p>"@TheEconomist, We really hope that such a reliable and a worldwide famous media will amend their map in an appropriate manner. #CrimeaIsUkraine," <a href="https://twitter.com/UkrEmbLondon/status/1198317819399720960">Ukraine's Embassy in the United Kingdom</a> wrote on Twitter on November 23.</p>

      <p>The Crimean peninsula was missing on Ukraine's map in a video clip posted by The Economist. At the moment, the video is not available. Its links have been deleted from the publication's social media accounts.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, the Embassy of Ukraine in the USA on November 7, 2019, urged editors of The New York Times to correct the mistake following the publication of Ukraine's map without Crimea.</p>
