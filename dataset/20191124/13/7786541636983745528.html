      <p>However, women are more likely than their male peers to <a href="https://www.ajc.com/lifestyles/health/women-more-likely-dissuaded-from-surgery-careers-because-gender-survey-shows/oy6P3gZp5YYlGDEDNdk8zM/">feel dissuaded from seeking a career in surgery</a> just because of their gender, <a href="https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/Abstract/publishahead/Barriers_to_Pursing_a_Career_in_Surgery__An.94856.aspx">a new survey found</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ajc.com/lifestyles/health/women-more-likely-dissuaded-from-surgery-careers-because-gender-survey-shows/oy6P3gZp5YYlGDEDNdk8zM/">The survey</a> is based on responses from students at Harvard Medical School. It found that similar percentages of male and female students intend to eventually become surgeons.</p>
      <p>Across genders, many students reported someone trying to dissuade them from the career move at some point, often because the demands can take a toll on a personal life. </p>
      <p>However, 72.7% of women students report believing the discouragement was tied to their gender, while just 1.5% of male respondents said the same. </p>
      <p>"Discouragement from faculty at the pre-med and student level definitely has an impact," Dr. Susan Pories, the study's coauthor, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-education/women-more-likely-to-be-warned-away-from-surgery-careers-due-to-gender-idUSKBN1XT2UN?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=healthNews">told Reuters</a>. "We owe it to medical students to empower them to pursue fields based on their passions, and to patients to have a body of surgeons that reflects population diversity." </p>
      <p>Women remain underrepresented in medicine as a whole, but the gap in surgery is especially wide. According to the Association of Women Surgeons, females <a href="https://blog.womensurgeons.org/residency/inspiring-our-future-by-encouraging-our-present/">account for about 19%</a> of working surgeons.</p>
      <p>"By discouraging individuals, particularly minorities, from entering the field, we do both a disservice," Pories said. "The reality is, women are successful in all surgical specialties (while still) achieving work-life balance."</p>
      <p>The study's authors acknowledge that while surgical careers come with a number of unique demands, they also can bring prestige and other professional benefits.</p>
      <p>"Additional support within the surgical field is needed to mitigate these concerns and support trainees in both their career and familial aspirations," the report concludes.</p>
