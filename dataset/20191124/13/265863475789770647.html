      <p>Joseline Hernandez opened up and talked to Nessa of Hot 97 in a recent interview about her struggles with co-parenting daughter Bonnie Bella with Stevie J.</p>
      <p>The former pair had hit some rough patches while trying to find the right balance, and there have been a lot of rumors saying that the two celebrities were battling legally for the custody of the little girl.</p>
      <p>According to recent gossip, Stevie J reportedly even managed to obtain sole custody of his daughter for one whole month, because Hernandez’s schedule had been too problematic.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, it seems that Hernandez and Stevie J have been trying to prove the rumors wrong as they regularly post photos of themselves, spending peaceful family time together.</p>
      <p>According to Hernandez, the current situation of co-parenting her daughter was okay, as things always got better even if they were ugly before that.</p>
      <p>She also stated to Nessa that Stevie J was married to a gorgeous woman, referring to Faith Evans.</p>
      <p>Hernandez also added that she and Evans were on excellent terms, and they spoke regularly on the phone as well, as Stevie J had met her fiancé DJ Ballistic — yes, the former <i>Love &amp; Hip Hop: Atlanta</i> star casually announced that she is engaged.</p>

      <p>The Puerto Rican Princess explained that they all cared for Bonnie Bella’s wellbeing and tried to keep the peace for her sake.</p>
      <p>She stated: “Whether you go through arguments, fights, court system … anything that you go through, it’s going to get better. It’s going to get ugly before it gets better, but it’ll always get better.”</p>
      <p>She added: “He’s a married man. His wife is gorgeous, and we speak on the phone, and I see her all the time. They know my fiance and my family. For us, it’s not a big deal. We really care about the little baby. I think that mothers are always going to be there. And fathers are going to come around. He’s becoming that. And [Bonnie Bella] loves him.”</p>
