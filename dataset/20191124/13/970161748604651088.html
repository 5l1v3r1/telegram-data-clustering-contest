      <p>Singing legend Rod Stewart has admitted he’s had a ‘falling out’ of sorts with Elton John, after criticising his latest creative endeavours.</p>
      <p>Seeing the If You Think I’m Sexy hitmaker has no qualms with calling out his frenemy, after Sir Elton recently worked on fantastical biopic Rocketman, before recently penning memoir Me: Elton John.</p>
      <p>He’s also embarking on a three-year tour to wrap up his time on the road – all things Rod isn’t too impressed with.</p>
      <p>Now 74-year-old Sir Rod (so many Sirs) has revealed a rift with his 72-year-old musical colleague, opening up during a recent radio interview.</p>
      <p>‘I do love Elton, only we’re not talking at the moment. We’ve had a spat,’ he said,<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7719111/Sir-Rod-Stewart-falls-Sir-Elton-John-criticising-latest-tour.html"> according to Mail On Sunday</a>.</p>
      <p>Asked why they had clashed, Rod was honest in his explanation, as he added: ‘Because I criticised his tour as being money-grabbing.’</p>

      <p>Still, Rod wasn’t ready to let it go and move on, as he continued to kick the boot in and criticised Rocketman as not holding a candle to the Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody.</p>

      <p>He described the Oscar-winning film, that stared Rami Malek in the lead role, as a ‘great rock ’n’ roll film’ but added of his mate’s Rocketman: ‘I don’t think this quite lived up to it.’</p>
      <p>On top of that, Rod also called the dancing in the film that starred Taron Egerton ‘a bit Mamma Mia’ in its style. Ouch.</p>
      <p>The two have had a seemingly tit for tat relationship over the years, after the 70s saw them engage in upmanship including at their Las Vegas gigs when Elton took Rod’s banner for his Blondes Have More Fun tour and created his own But Brunettes Make More Money version.</p>

      <p>The two insisted in 1983, that despite appearances, they’re ‘actually very good friends’, however, as Elton added, things would hit the fan ‘when they both get in the Top 10’ and battle for the lead spot on the charts.</p>
      <p>Things then got personal when, in 1990, Rod married third wife Rachel Hunter, Elton apparently sent them a £10 gift voucher for Boots.</p>
      <p>Nice, that.</p>
      <p>In March Rod drew first blood about Elton’s farewell tour,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/03/22/rod-stewart-slams-elton-johns-farewell-tour-dishonest-7408686/"> poking fun at the extravagant bowing out.</a></p>
      <p>Elton’s adversary was appearing on What What Happens Live With Andy Cohen when he was asked by a viewer what he made of the whole retirement tour palaver.</p>
      <p>‘I did email her and said, “What, again dear?”‘ Rod said. ‘And I didn’t hear anything back.’</p>

      <p>He added: ‘Talking about retirement, I’ve never spoken about retirement, and if I do retire, I won’t make an announcement.</p>
      <p>‘I’ll just fade away, I don’t think this big deal, “I’m going to retire” – it stinks of selling tickets…it’s dishonest. It’s not rock and roll.’</p>
