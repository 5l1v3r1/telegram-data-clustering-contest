        <b>Michael van Gerwen says he could channel Ronnie O’Sullivan and turn down a 9-darter as there is no prize for hitting the perfect leg in the PDC.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The world number one hit the first televised 9-darter of the year on Saturday at the Players Championship Finals, on his way to a second round win over Adrian Lewis.</p>
      <p>However, he claimed to be not fussed about the feat, and even suggested he could purposefully turn down a 9-darter in future if there is no prize money.</p>
      <p>Five-time world <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/snooker/">snooker</a> champion O’Sullivan famously turned down the chance for a 147 break at the 2016 Welsh Open because the £10,000 prize money for a maximum was ‘too cheap’ and MVG certainly thinks no prize at all is scandalous.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t really care, to be fair, no prize money or nothing, I should go for the single eight, just like Ronnie O’Sullivan,’ said Van Gerwen on his 9-dart achievement.</p>

      <p>When asked if that would disappoint the crowd, the Dutchman added: ‘I don’t care, there should be a little prize, simple.’</p>

      <p>It seems very unlikely that Mighty Mike would ever do this because turning down a shot at a double leaves a leg alive, whereas if a snooker player turns down a 147, the frame will have already been wrapped up.</p>
      <p>There is also an argument to say that it would be falling foul of not playing to the best of your abilities, which is punishable by the Darts Regulation Authority.</p>
      <p>There has previously been a prize for nailing a 9-darter, but it was removed last year in a restructuring of the PDC’s prize money.</p>
      <p>Snooker’s 147 prize pot has come in for criticism after a change at the start of the season which makes it extremely unlikely any player will win anything for hitting a maximum.</p>
      <p>If there are 20 maximum breaks over the season then a £1m prize pot is shared between all those who made the breaks, but seen as the most ever in a season is 13, this is almost out of the question.</p>
      <p>Even when the prize was a very decent £10,000, it wasn’t enough for the Rocket.</p>

      <p>‘I knew it was £10,000. I could have done it, but I didn’t think the prize was worthy of a 147. So I’ve tried to let it build up until it’s worthy and then go for it,’ O’Sullivan said.</p>
      <p>‘It’s like going into a Mercedes garage and when they say that you can have the car for £3,000, you reply, ‘No way, that’s too cheap. I’m not buying it for that’</p>
      <p>‘Certain things have value, and a 147 is a special moment. I want it to feel special all round.</p>
      <p>‘But the punters still got value for money today. Now they’ve got something more to look forward to. There’s still room for improvement.</p>
      <p>‘You like to entertain your fans. It’s like a film. You want them to come back and watch the next one.</p>
      <p>‘There is no point in giving them the best ending they’ve ever had. Leave room for a better ending next time.’</p>
