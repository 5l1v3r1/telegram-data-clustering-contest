      <p>LOS ANGELES -- Elon Musk says Tesla has received nearly 150,000 orders for its new electric pickup truck since the automaker revealed the futuristic vehicle earlier this week to mixed reviews.</p>
      <p>The Tesla CEO tweeted Saturday that the company received 146,000 orders for the wedge-shaped "Cybertruck" since is unveiling Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Musk said 17 per cent of the orders are for the single-motor model, 42 per cent are for the dual-motor version and 41 per cent are for the tri-motor model.</p>
      <p>The much-hyped unveiling went off script when its supposedly unbreakable window glass splintered twice when hit with a large metal ball. Some analysts panned the truck's blocky, angular looks.</p>
      <p>Placing an order costs buyers US$100, which Tesla says is fully refundable.</p>
      <p>Tesla has said the "Cybertruck," which starts at US$39,900, will be in production in 2021.</p>
