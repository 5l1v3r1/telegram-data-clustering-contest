      <h1>Eden Hazard aims dig at former Chelsea bosses Antonio Conte and Maurizio Sarri</h1>
      <h2>Real Madrid superstar Eden Hazard played under Antonio Conte and Maurizio Sarri at Chelsea and has spoken about their training methods</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:33:46+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Eden Hazard has claimed that Chelsea's training sessions under former bosses Antonio Conte and Maurizio Sarri was "much less fun" than it is at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> .</p>
      <p>The Belgian spent seven years at the Blues after joining from Lille in 2012, he went on to score 110 goals in 352 games and bowed out with a brace in the Blues' Europa League final victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> .</p>
      <p>Hazard eventually quit the Premier League for Real Madrid in the summer, moving to Spain in a switch which could surpass £130million.</p>
      <p>After a slow start to his Bernabeu spell, the forward is beginning to shine for the Spanish giants and he has now opened up on life under manager Zinedine Zidane.</p>

      <p>“The training is always with the ball," Hazard told <i>L'Equipe</i> .</p>
      <p>"When you have experimented with Italians, as I have done with Conte or Sarri, you have much less fun. Everything is more framed."</p>
      <p>When asked about Sarri's coaching methods, Hazard added: "It's hard to compare. I was attracted to Zidane at Madrid and felt very identified. He fascinates me and has even some power over me.</p>
      <p>"During Euro 2016 he told me: 'It would be good if you came'. And when Zidane calls you it's hard to say no.</p>

      <p>"He loves his players and you feel that the dressing room is happy to have him as a coach."</p>
      <p>Hazard recently admitted that he rejected numerous offers from Paris Saint-Germain before making the move to Spain.</p>
      <p>"They often tried to recruit me, but I didn't want to return to Ligue 1 unless it was to join Lille," he said in an interview with <a href="https://www.lequipe.fr/">L'Equipe</a> .</p>
      <p>"I always said no to them. It was clear in my mind that if I were to return to France it would be with Lille."</p>
