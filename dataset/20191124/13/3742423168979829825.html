      <p>Kindergarteners have a lot on their plate. They’re getting adept at recognising letters and numbers, they’re counting in sequence, they’re learning how to sound out words and then they’re learning that many words in English can’t actually be “sounded out.” Words like “their,” “know,” “who” and “does” are among approximately 100 words they must memorise because they’re either very frequent or can’t be sounded out. They have to know them by sight.</p>
      <p>Each week, they come home with a new list of unfamiliar words that they should, by the end of the week, be able to recognise and spell. It’s a lot. But one dad in our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2018785615043946/">Offspring Facebook Group</a> came up with a way to keep letters, numbers and sight words easily accessible for practice all week long; he tapes them to the inside of his kitchen cabinets:</p>

      <p>“(Here is) my kitchen kindergarten set up for letters, numbers and sight words,” group member Daniel Bintz says. “I use a laser pointer; other than that, pretty low tech. Just got tired of sheets of paper everywhere.”</p>
      <p>It’s easy to switch the sheets out from week to week, and while you’re cooking dinner, you can open up the cabinets and do a little practice with your kid.</p>
      <p>A (slightly more devious) variation on this from another group member: Tape their sight words to your bedroom door and tell your kids they’re the “passwords” to enter in the morning.</p>
