      <h1>RUMOR: Disney May Be Working on Series Featuring Star Wars' Doctor Aphra</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:11:19+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Chapman</a></address>
      <p>The latest rumors from the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars/"><i>Star Wars</i></a> universe suggest that Disney could be working on a new live-action series based on Doctor Aphra.</p>
      <p>According to <i><a href="http://starwarsunity.net/2019/11/23/rumor-doctor-aphra-might-be-getting-a-tv-series/">Star Wars Unity</a></i>, Disney+ is sketching out plans for a <i>Doctor Aphra</i> series. While the news should be taken with a pinch of salt for now, the anti-hero's fan-favorite legacy would undoubtedly make her a popular choice for a spin-off. For those who need an introduction, Doctor Aphra first appeared as part of the new canon in the 2015 comic, <i>Star Wars: Darth Vader</i>.</p>

      <p>Effectively a villainous space archeologist, Aphra also has the honor of becoming the first character outside the movies to get their own Marvel comic. Originally working with the Dark Lord of the Sith, Aphra later went on the run from Vader. Elsewhere, she's usually found with murderbots Triple-Zero and Beetee-One -- dark versions of R2-D2 and C-3PO.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, there's a wild theory that <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-c-3po-possessed-triple-0/">C-3PO is possessed by Triple-Zero in <i>Star Wars: The Rise of the Skywalker</i></a>, which would be a neat segue into a Doctor Aphra series. As Bob Iger refocuses the future of <i>Star Wars</i> with an increased emphasis on television, it's important to remember the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-less-is-more-bob-iger/">Disney CEO has already said "less is more"</a> when it comes to the world of Sith and Jedi. Will <i>Doctor Aphra</i> come to pass, or is this just another Josh Trank/<i>Boba Fett</i> movie all over again?</p>
