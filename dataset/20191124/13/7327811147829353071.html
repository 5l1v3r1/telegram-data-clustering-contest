      <p>NEW ROCHELLE, Westchester County (WABC) -- The New Rochelle High School football team won its second playoff game without their long-time head coach.</p>
      <p>Saturday night the team came back to defeat Shenendehowa 24-17 in the Class AA state semifinals.</p>
      <p>Louis DiRienzo was reassigned pending an investigation as parents and students <a href="https://abc7ny.com/sports/parents-show-support-for-new-rochelle-coach-who-was-reassigned/5708040/">continue to show support</a> for him.</p>
      <p>New Rochelle teachers were among those who rallied outside of City Hall on Friday.</p>
      <p>The school board re-assigned DiRienzo while it investigates him for an incident involving a student.</p>
      <p>District officials would not comment on the circumstances of the investigation, but parents say that it involved a student who is DiRienzo's relative and who was impaired in some way at school.</p>
      <p>DiRienzo contacted that person's father, the parents say, and allowed them to leave the school rather than face discipline -- an apparent violation of school protocol.</p>
      <p>The decision has been met with major backlash from players, students and the football parents association, and it has <a href="https://abc7ny.com/sports/new-rochelle-students-walk-out-in-support-of-reassigned-football-coach/5699838/">included protests and walkouts</a>.</p>
