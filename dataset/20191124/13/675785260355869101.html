      <h1>Joseph Baena spitting image of dad Arnold Schwarzenegger in bulging bicep snap</h1>
      <h2>Joseph Baena is following in the footsteps of his Terminator father with muscles that any body builder would die for</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:59:32+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:59</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror .co.uk</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arnold-schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> 's son Joseph Baena proved buffness is passed down in DNA with this jawdropping snap.</p>
      <p>The youngster took to instagram to show off his exceptionally muscular frame looking like a mirror image of his stocky dad during his Terminator days.</p>
      <p>He seemed keen to show off the results off his workouts, wearing a serious expression and flexing his biceps as he posed for the camera in just a pair of gym trousers.</p>
      <p>The recent university graduate - the youngest of Arnold's five children and mothered by Arnold's ex-housekeeper said, "Got nominated for the #classicchallenge by @dakota_stinson, so HERE YA GO!"</p>

      <p>The challenge has been doing the rounds with bodybuilders online, and despite Joseph's studies he obviously did not miss the opportunity to show that in no way has he been slacking in the gym.</p>
      <p>His fans were happy to point out the uncanny similarities between him and his dad. One said, "arnold 2.0 no doubt" while others could not help but write in capitals "ARRRRRNOLD" and "starting to look like your father!"</p>
      <p>Many praised his shockingly fit physique, one  saying, "Is it hard being such a tank" and another,  "gotta catch up to your mass some how".</p>
      <p>The young bodybuilder seems to be deliberately imitating his father in this area and has a lot to live up to. Arnold was at the top of his game in his 20s and 30s winning the bodybuilding title of Mr Olympia seven times.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time Joseph has shown off his gains in the gym to his 125,000 <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> followers, he sometimes posts eye-watering weight lifting exercises.</p>

      <p>Learning from the legend himself, he uploaded an image of himself and his dad in the gym on his birthday, writing, "BIG happy birthday to the best training partner in the world! Love you dad."</p>
