        <b>We hope to see an evenly-fought contest as Manchester United take on Sheffield United in the Premier League on Sunday – but both teams’ wage bills prove that they are quite different from each other.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As per <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7710765/Manchester-Utd-paying-Alexis-Sanchez-Sheffield-Utds-ENTIRE-squad-earn.html"><i>Daily Mail</i></a>, Manchester United have such a huge wage bill that the wages they pay their on-loan star Alexis Sanchez, is more than the wage bill dedicated to Sheffield United’s entire squad.</p>
      <p>Despite finishing sixth last season and sitting at eighth place in the table right now during their ongoing 2019-20 campaign, Manchester United have the highest wage bill in the Premier League – at £171million.</p>
      <p>And quite shockingly, United are paying Sanchez (on loan at Serie A club Inter Milan and currently injured) more than Sheffield United are paying their entire squad.</p>
      <p>Inter Milan are paying around £4.5million of the Chilean attacker’s £21million annual salary. This means that the Red Devils are paying the rest, which amounts up to £16.5million.</p>
      <p>By contrast, Sheffield United has an annual wage bill of £14million, which is the lowest in the Premier League this season.</p>
      <p>This means that Manchester United can pay the wages of all of Sheffield United’s players from their own budget, and still have close to £2.5million remaining, if it means they can offload just Sanchez.</p>
      <p>Easily the biggest financial mismatch that we have seen in a long time.</p>
