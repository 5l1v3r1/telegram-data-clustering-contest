      <p>A K-Pop star has been found dead at her home just six months after a previous suicide attempt.</p>
      <p>Goo Hara, 28, was found on Saturday evening (November 23) at her home in Gangnam's Cheongdam neighborhood.</p>
      <p>She was a member of the band Kara before she made her solo debut in 2015 with EP Alohara (Can You Feel It?).</p>
      <p>It was reported she tried to take her own life back in May, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/breaking-k-pop-star-goo-20949351">Mirror Online reports</a> .</p>
      <p>As she was recovering in hospital, she apologised to her fans, saying: “I am sorry for causing concerns and a commotion.</p>
      <p>"In terms of health, I am recovering … I had been in agony over a number of overlapping issues. But from now on, I will steel my heart and try to show up healthy.”</p>
      <p>Goo was close friends with tragic star Sulli who died in October after being targeted by online trolls.</p>
      <p>Police said in a statement that the 25-year-old had been suffering from "severe depression". The exact cause of her death was still under investigation.</p>
