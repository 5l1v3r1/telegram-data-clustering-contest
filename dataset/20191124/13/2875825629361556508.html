      <h1>Mike Denver: I'm excited to meet Corrie favourites Samia Longchambon and Mikey North</h1>
      <h2>"I will have to put my nerves and any thoughts of being starstruck aside"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:25:55+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/mike-denver/" target="_blank">Mike Denver</a></address>
      <p>We were all big soap fans when I was growing up simply because we didn’t have as much choice.</p>
      <p>There were no <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a>, streaming or on-demand TV back then so I grew up watching the likes of Emmerdale and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fair-city">Fair City</a> and it’s great credit to them that they are still as popular as ever today despite the stiff competition.</p>
      <p>So you’ll understand my excitement at the prospect of meeting Coronation Street’s Mikey North and Samia Longchambon at the Guy Clothing Fashion Show in Tullamore on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>I will have to put my nerves and any thoughts of being starstruck aside because the night is all in aid of two great charities Jigsaw Offaly - providing a free and confidential support service for young people and Offaly and Search and Recovery.</p>

      <p>All these years later I am still watching the soaps because Liz always has them on, well that’s my story anyway.</p>
      <p>I’m also looking forward to catching with Dancing with the Stars champion, and former Kerry footballer Aidan O’Mahony as well as getting a few Christmas style tips from rugby pundit Brent Pope at the event.</p>
      <h3>Sad welcome to the jungle</h3>
      <p>There have been a lot of nasty comments directed at Caitlyn Jenner on I’m a Celebrity... Get me out of Here!</p>
      <p>It’s a shame to have such negativity attached to one of ITV’s biggest shows consistently with a massive fan base across Ireland and the UK.</p>
      <p>It’s not fair that Caitlyn has been subjected to cruel transphobic abuse online- this social media bullying has to stop once and for all before something serious occurs! Perhaps the broadcaster needs to step in and protect the cast.</p>
      <p>They do have a responsibility to those taking part, it can’t all be just about the ratings.</p>

      <p>Once people are watching it, ITV are going to continue airing it and paying the stars huge money to appear.</p>
      <p>We have two Irish stars taking part this year Nadine Coyle and Andrew Maxwell.</p>
      <p>I hadn’t heard of Andrew before he went into the jungle but he’s coming across really well and he has my support to become King of the Jungle next month.</p>
      <h3>Sort out this mess</h3>
      <p>The news that former prisoners are suing the government over conditions in Mountjoy has raised a few eyebrows.</p>
      <p>I know prison is supposed to be a form of punishment, however, it is a basic right for people to have proper toilet facilities in this day and age.</p>
      <p>The Government must sort this out.</p>
      <h3>Friendly hairdressers are a cut above</h3>
      <p>For me, a trip to the hairdressers or barbers is as much about the chat as the grooming, so I don’t get why people are calling for silent hair appointments these days.</p>
      <p>I go to the salon once or twice a month to keep trim and tidy and I look forward to switching off and having a light conversation.</p>
      <p>Edel at Empire in Portumna has been doing my hair for the past 20 years, she is part raconteur, part problem-solver and hair stylist all rolled into one.</p>
      <p>It’s a great place to hear the news and get to know what is happening around town.</p>

      <p>I’m sure many friendly and caring hairdressers have helped combat loneliness, particularly around times when people might be vulnerable like Christmas.</p>
      <p>A haircut is a relaxing and therapeutic experience.</p>
      <p>Isn’t  catching up with everyone and being friendly in the community what Ireland is all about? Give me a real person over a phone any day.</p>
