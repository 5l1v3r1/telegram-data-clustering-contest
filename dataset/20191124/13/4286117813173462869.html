      <p>Congress leader Ashok Chavan has alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying to contact the party MLAs.</p>
      <p>Ashok Chavan on Sunday alleged that BJP leaders had booked rooms in hotels where his party MLAs are put up and were contacting some of them.</p>
      <p>Speculation was rife that the task of getting MLAs into the BJP's fold has been entrusted to senior leader Radhkrishna Vikhe Patil, who had crossed over from the Congress to the BJP ahead of the October Assembly polls, Sainik-turned-Congressman-turned BJP Rajya Sabha MP Narayan Rane, NCP-turned-BJP MLA Ganesh Naik and Babanrao Pachpute.</p>
      <p>When asked about the speculation, Vikhe Patil gave a cryptic and open-to-interpretation reply, stating "I have good relations with all MLAs".</p>
      <p>Chavan told reporters that some Congress MLAs had told him about the move by the BJP.</p>
      <p>He said, "Our MLAs are being approached by BJP. They are getting calls. BJP people are booking rooms and staying in the hotel. Our MLAs are contacted by BJP, But let me assure you that our MLAs are intact. Sena, Congress and NCP MLAs are secured and intact."</p>
      <p>"We are not worried about anything we have the numbers. Will prove the majority. BJP is trying very hard to delay the matter and get time to break our MLAs," he said.</p>
      <p>Reacting on Ajit Pawar's tweets thanking everyone, Chavan said, "Ajit Pawar is in no position to thank anyone. First, he has to prove majority on the floor."</p>
      <p>He also said that MLAs from the Shiv Sena, Congress and the NCP will not go to BJP.</p>
      <p>"Our MLAs are telling us everything. No one from the three parties will go to BJP," he said.</p>
      <p>"Our MLAs are united and will not be poached," Chavan said.</p>
      <p>MLAs of the Congress, NCP and Sena are sequestered in different hotels in the metropolis, to stall any attempts by the BJP to poach them ahead of the floor test in the Assembly.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, BJP leader Ravindra Chavan was seen entering Hotel Renaissance in suburban Powai where NCP MLAs have been staying since Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Sources said these NCP MLAs are now being moved to another location nearby.</p>
      <p>The Congress legislators were earlier supposed to leave for Jaipur, but were later put up in Mumbai in view of the fast-paced political developments, according to sources.</p>
      <p>While the Congress MLAs are staying in JW Marriott hotel in Juhu, the MLAs of the Sena are staying at The Lalit hotel located near the Mumbai international airport.</p>
      <p>The BJP made a return to power in a dramatic way early Saturday morning after NCP leader Ajit Pawar joined hands, leading to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari swearing in Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister and Pawar as his deputy.</p>
      <p>Given the political scenario in the state, the role of MLAs has become far more crucial during the floor test in the 288-member House where the halfway mark is 145.</p>
      <p>In the assembly polls held in October, the BJP had won 105 seats, the Shiv Sena 56, the NCP 54 and the Congress 44.</p>
      <p>According to sources, Independent and other MLAs could tilt the scales in favour of either the BJP-led government of Fadnavis backed by Ajit Pawar or the Sena-Congress-NCP combine during the floor test.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, the supreme court said the issue of floor test, as demanded by the Congress-NCP-Sena combine, would be dealt with on Monday only after perusing the two letters- of Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari inviting Fadnavis and of the BJP leader staking his claim to form the government- it has demanded.</p>
      <p>For their parts, the BJP and the opposition combine have claimed that they have the requisite numbers and would win the floor test comfortably.</p>
