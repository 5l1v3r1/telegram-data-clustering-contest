        <b>Gatundu MP Moses Kuria took an issue with President Uhuru Kenyatta's team based on his tone in a video he posted on social media onÂ Sunday, November 24.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the video, the visibly disappointed <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46437-kuria-angrily-trashes-uhurus-sagana-address-video">lawmaker accused the Presidential Delivery Unit (PDU)</a> of taking up some responsibilities in government but hiding it from the public.</p>
      <p>In the outburst, the MP claimed that the PDU had taken over the budgeting role and challenged them to make the information public in order to be consulted by the Parliament in its subsequent debates.</p>

      <p>"Mr Cabinet Secretary, I really don't understand why we are here, I really don't understand because the 30th of April is our constitutional deadline to pass the estimates. On February 15 when we passed the budget policy statement, we were told that it was in line with the big four. Maybe this is Big Four version two.</p>
      <p>"So what has changed, Bwana CS, what has changed? I want us to be honest with each other. Because I know what is happening is that somewhere along the line, the executive decided that PDU is the one to take over the budgeting rule. We should have been told so that we engage with them," wondered Kuria.</p>
      <p>"If PDU is trying to convert itself into an OMB (Office of Management and Budget), let them not shy away, let them come here and we will pass the supporting legislation," he continued.</p>
      <p>The discussion took place in Parliament on Tuesday, November 19.</p>
      <p>During the discussion, the fiery legislator further insinuated that <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/46102-exclusive-moses-kurias-biggest-regret-after-joining-politics">a project being carried by the president might be under jeopardy</a> following an alteration into the betting policy instituted by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i.</p>
      <p>"We have a lot of work to do, we need to start off with a culture of openness and transparency. Let us not hide all the cards below the table.</p>
      <p>"If you look at all areas we want to budget, the universal health care for example, what were we thinking when we were stopping betting. Now that it has created a hole, instead of acknowledging the effect of betting of that not-well-thought-out policy is coming back to haunt us because that was supposed to fund a big chunk of universal healthcare," explained Kuria.</p>
      <p>Two major betting firms, Sportpesa and Betin, have since exited the Kenyan market following months of a tussle with the state over taxation and regulations.</p>
