      <h1>Chief of Staff Aviv Kochavi to Start Inspecting IDF Bases and Toilets</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:15:50+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/jewishpressstaff/" target="_blank">Jewish Press Staff</a></address>
      <p>IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kochavi has shown he is willing to roll up his sleeves and get his hands dirty when it comes to fixing and improving the IDF and restoring the victory ethos back into the IDF spirit.</p>
      <p>On Sunday morning, the Chief of Staff, along with senior IDF officers, began  a countrywide inspection of 180 army bases from Mt. Hermon to Eilat, according to Galei Tzahal reporter Tsahi Dabush.</p>
      <p>The senior officers will be reviewing how the bases look, their security, their safety, their recycling and ecological impact (Kochavi is a vegan, after all) – and at the condition of their toilets and showers. There have been many complaints by reservists regarding the cleanliness and conditions of the toilets on the bases they go to serve on.</p>
      <p>If the officers are already inspecting the bathrooms, one hopes they’ll do something not just about the cleanliness, the lack of hand soap and toilet paper one often finds, but dealing with the complete lack of facilities at the rifle ranges.</p>
