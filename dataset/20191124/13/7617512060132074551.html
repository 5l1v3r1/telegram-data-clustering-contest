      <p>A single-family home in Sidney suffered extensive damage in a fire Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>The blaze started just before 4 p.m. in a home on Beacon Avenue West, said fire chief Brett Mikkelsen with the Sidney Volunteer Fire Department. Crews arrived to find large flames coming from the garage area of the one-storey home.</p>
      <p>The occupants, a man and a woman, were both outside when fire crews arrived and were uninjured. Mikkelsen said he believes a child lives in the home, but was not there at the time.</p>
      <p>Firefighters extinguished most of the fire from the outside, before entering to put out flames in the attic. They rescued a hamster, and retrieved passports and Christmas gifts.</p>
      <p>A photo posted to the fire departmentâ€™s Twitter page shows roughly half of the house charred, with parts of the roof completely burned away.</p>
      <p>Mikkelsen said investigators are at the house today to try to determine the cause of the fire.</p>
