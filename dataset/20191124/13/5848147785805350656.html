      <h1>‘Australian first’: Postecoglou on verge of claiming Japan League title</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:34:29+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/aap/" target="_blank">AAP</a></address>
      <p>Ange Postecoglou is on the verge of becoming the first Australian coach to win the J-League title after steering his Yokohama F. Marinos team to the top of the standings with two games remaining.</p>
      <p>Former Socceroos coach Postecoglou guided Yokohama to the summit with a 1-0 win at Matsumoto Yamuga on Saturday.</p>
      <p>That result and FC Tokyo’s surprise 1-1 draw with lowly Shonan Bellmare saw the top two change positions.</p>
      <p>Yokohama are on 64 points with Tokyo on 63. Kashima Antlers, the only other team in title contention, are on 60.</p>
      <p>Postecoglou’s man could clinch the title as soon as next weekend if they beat fourth-placed Kawasaki Frontale away and Tokyo lose to 13th-placed Urawa Red Diamonds.</p>
      <p>However, it is more likely it will come down to a final round home showdown with Tokyo on December 7.</p>
      <p>Postecoglou’s side are unbeaten in the league since August 17, a span of nine games.</p>
      <p>However, the former Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory boss – who recently signed a one-year contract extension with Yokohama that will take him through till the end of next season – was not getting carried away with the title up for grabs.</p>
      <p>“Just keep playing our football, that’s what’s got us to here,” said Postecoglou.</p>
      <p>“We look forward to a big game next week against Kawasaki. They’re a fantastic team and we look forward to that challenge.”</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old Postecoglou is wildly popular in Yokohama for driving the five-time champions to within reach of a first success since 2004 with minimal spending, as well as establishing an exciting brand of attacking football.</p>
      <p>It’s an impressive improvement for the club who finished 12th last season and narrowly avoided a relegation play-off in Postecoglou’s first campaign in Japan’s top flight.</p>
