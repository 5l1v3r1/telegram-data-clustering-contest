      <h1>Crypto’s Killer Kiosk? New Device for Frictionless Payments Integrates Nano for the Mainstream</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:40:34+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>A self-service kiosk for shoppers who want to pay for everyday items using cryptocurrency is now available for merchants.</p>
      <p>UK-based fintech Kappture, which manufactures point of sale systems for the event industry, has just released its fee-less system supporting crypto payments in Nano.</p>
      <p>The machine features a user interface designed for fast and easy transactions for consumers on the go. Payments are confirmed by the securely decentralized Nano network.</p>
      <p>Neil Haran, Kappture’s chief technology officer, says the company has seen a lot of interest in cryptocurrency products and that he expects merchants to trial the new tech in private.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Many of our higher education customers are opening blockchain postgrads this academic year. With recent advances in digital currency technology, specifically fee-less ultrafast transactions, there is a unique opportunity for these progressive institutions to consider digital currency for the first time.”</i>

      <p>Kappture’s latest merchant device exclusively integrates the cryptocurrency Nano because of its ability to handle fast transactions and zero fees over a secure, decentralized network.</p>
      <p>According to the company,</p>
      <p>
        <i>In summary, we selected Nano for the following reasons:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>a. Fast. Sub-second confirmation is quicker than bank payment cards.</i>
        <br/>
        <i>b. Feeless. Zero fees irrespective of the amount. Nano can be used with no minimum payment.</i>
        <br/>
        <i>c. Decentralized. At the time of writing it would require the collusion of three unrelated parties</i>
        <br/>
        <i>(whom all have a verifiable interest in the currency’s value), to attack the network.</i>
        <br/>
        <i>Game theory asserts that these actors will not behave in a way contrary to their interests.</i>
        <br/>
        <i>d. Scalable. Every account has a separate blockchain which can be updated independently of other accounts – this removes contention issues associated with early cryptocurrencies.</i>
        <br/>
        <i>e. Green. Our terminals lead the way in energy consumption and supporting a project that relies heavily on PoW would be contrary to this goal.</i>
      </p>
      <p>As a leading player in the event industry, Kappture has built up an ecosystem that already supports thousands of terminals in Western Europe.</p>
      <p>Their clients include Ascot Racecourse, Wimbledon and Twickenham, with kiosks that enable several payment options including cash, third-party account interfaces, and over 15 bank payment cards.</p>
