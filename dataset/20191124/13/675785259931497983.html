      <h1>Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger to help Premier League improve VAR</h1>
      <h2>Arsene Wenger was handed his first job in football since he left Arsenal recently when FIFA made him their new Chief of Global Football Development</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:17:29+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:17</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>The Premier League are ready to turn to Arsene Wenger to help improve the standards of VAR.</p>
      <p>Legendary <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> manager Wenger was named as FIFA's new Chief of Global Football Development earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman is also on the International FA Board's Football and Technical Advisory Panels - which make changes to the Laws of the Game and look at ways to improve football through its rules.</p>
      <p>The next meeting of IFAB is on December 3 in Belfast - with Wenger scheduled to be there.</p>
      <p>As such, Mike Riley, who is the head of referees' Professional Game Match Officials Limited, is looking forward to talking to Wenger to see how VAR can be made better.</p>

      <p>"Arsene's appointment is a really good opportunity to talk to people and influence them. I have no doubt those conversations will be taking place," said Riley.</p>
      <p>VAR has been a controversial addition to the Premier League since it was incorporated into the division at the beginning of the season.</p>
      <p>Riley admitted earlier this weekend that the video review system had incorrectly overturned four decisions what he on-field red had got right.</p>

      <p>The Gunners were on the receiving end when Sokratis Papastathopoulos' late goal was ruled out against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> in October.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> were wrongly awarded a penalty against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> and both <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> should not have been handed a spot kicks versus Norwich and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> respectively.</p>
      <p>"The worst outcome is when the referee on the field makes right decision and the VAR intervenes to make wrong decision," said Riley.</p>
      <p>"It will happen. That is part of the balance of understanding what is clear and obvious.</p>
      <p>"Look at any country that has put in VAR, everyone has to go through a learning curve. We are going through that now."</p>
      <p>Despite the problems, Riley is pleading with fans to give the system more of a chance.</p>
      <p>"Let's not look at what might have happened so far," he continued.</p>
      <p>"Let's take all these learnings and go how do we improve the system going forward because we've all got a stake in making sure that happens."</p>
