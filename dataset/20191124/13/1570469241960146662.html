      <p>A passenger plane with about 17 passengers on board crashed on Sunday in the city of Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, killing several people, the provincial governor's office said.</p>
      <p>The plane, operated by the local company Busy Bee, crashed during takeoff for a flight to the city of Beni, North Kivu Governor Carly Nzanzu Kasivita's office said in a statement. The number of fatalities was not yet clear.</p>
      <p>Busy Bee was not available for comment.</p>
      <p>Air accidents are relatively frequent in Congo because of lax safety standards and poor maintenance. All Congolese commercial carriers, including Busy Bee, are banned from operating in the European Union.</p>
      <p>A cargo plane departing from the same airport crashed an hour after take-off in October, killing all eight passengers.</p>
