      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> said she can understand <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-harry/">Prince Harry</a> and his wife Meghan Markle’s need for ‘privacy’.</p>
      <p>She is part of the one most famous families in the world, another being the royal family.</p>
      <p>In a new interview the mum-of-four was asked if she felt sorry for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.</p>
      <p>Kim mentioned Prince Harry’s mother Princess Diana, and how her life was shadowed by the media.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Australian programme The Sunday Project: ‘I think everyone has their own journey. I think their journey is extremely personal, with what [ Harry’s] mother experienced and how her life was so affected by the spotlight and by paparazzi.</p>

      <p>‘I don’t think anyone can really understand what that’s like except for them. But I think as I’m older and as I have kids, and what I would want for them is just the safest place.</p>
      <p>‘I can definitely empathise with their need for having a secure, safe place and taking time for themselves and having privacy when they need it.’</p>
      <p>Meghan recently became emotional while <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/18/meghan-markle-close-tears-describing-struggles-new-mum-10942919/">speaking about her struggles as a new mum in the spotlight</a>.</p>

      <p>‘Him and I talked and it was something that was important to him to show on the show because that’s where he’s at in his life.</p>
      <p>‘It is totally natural that a husband and a wife would be in different places in life and just have different ideas about things and having disagreements about things like that. But it’s about how you handle it and how you compromise and what comes about that that I think really celebrates our relationship.’</p>
