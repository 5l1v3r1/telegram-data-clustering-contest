      <h1>Street recycling bins could be re-trialled by Dublin City Council</h1>

        <b>The re-trial of on-street recycling bins is being considered by Dublin City Council.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Plans to trial segregated recycling bins will be unveiled at the first meeting of the council for Climate Change, Environment and Energy.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-city-council-re-trial-segregated-bins-4903920-Nov2019/">trial</a> to place the bins in certain parts of the city is part of the council's latest litter management plan.</p>
      <p>The idea was previously trialled in 2018 at two different locations in the city but was deemed unsuccessful due to paper, plastic and aluminium cans being found in the wrong segments.</p>

      <p>The move is hoping to encourage recycling at street level from the public, with a pilot programme currently being developed along with a number of NGOs and industry figures.</p>
      <p>The trial is likely to happen before next summer, although the locations are yet to be revealed.</p>
      <p>Michael Pidgeon, councillor for the Green Party, told TheJournal.ie that the idea had proven a success in other cities but was still in its early stages.</p>
      <p>"We've seen this elsewhere so hopefully it can work here. It's the first meeting of the committee next week, so we'll see what happens then," he said.</p>
