      <p>They may not quit, but they don't seem particularly happy, either.</p>
      <p>Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/navy-chief-says-he-would-follow-trumps-instructions-on-navy-seal/2019/11/23/0c18c66c-0e31-11ea-97ac-a7ccc8dd1ebc_story.html">said</a> Saturday he has no intentions of resigning.
