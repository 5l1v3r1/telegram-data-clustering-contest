        <b>Tottenham scouts have planned regular trips to watch Bournemouth defender Nathan Ake in action ahead of a potential swoop for the player, according to reports.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As it stands, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/tottenham-hotspur"><b>Spurs</b></a> are to take a blow to their defensive options in the summer with Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen both out of contract at the end of the season with no plans yet in place for them to extend their deals.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/sources-tottenham-line-up-transfer-missions-for-player-mourinhos-managed-before/"><b>Football Insider</b></a>, however, the North London club are planning ahead and have scheduled scouting missions as they look to sign a left-sided centre-back who can fill in at left-back.</p>
      <p>The source says that one such player who could fill that role is Ake, who has been one of Bournemouth’s most vital players having appeared in every Premier League game since the start of last season.</p>
      <p>It is claimed that <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/nathan-ake"><b>Ake</b></a> – who signed for the Cherries from Chelsea in 2017 – has been eyed by Spurs officials as an ideal replacement for Vertonghen, 33, with scouts set to take notes at several points throughout the season.</p>
      <p>Ake has played 104 times for Bournemouth since his move to the south coast, chipping in with 10 goals and five assists in that time.</p>
