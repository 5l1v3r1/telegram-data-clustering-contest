      <p>Mairead Nolan’s dying wish came true on Friday night thanks to Westlife.</p>
      <p>Mairead, who bravely lives with a terminal ovarian cancer diagnosis, had wished to see the boys performing live and meet them before her life comes to an end.</p>
      <p>Mairead’s wish came true on Friday evening, when she was invited backstage at the RTE studios to watch Shane Filan, Nicky Byrne, Mark Feehily and Kian Egan rehearse for their Late Late Show slot.</p>

      <p>Mairead told the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/cork-woman-mairead-nolans-dying-20945437">Irish Sunday Mirror</a>: “I am in floods of tears after meeting them, I was just so excited. It was better than my wildest dreams and it has given me a lift and the push I need to fight the cancer.”</p>
      <p>“I found out recently that I have a spot on my liver also, so I said to the lads that I didn’t think I would make the concert in August in Pairc Ui Chaoimh.”</p>
      <p>“But Nicky said he will bring me up on stage and it gave me a great boost. I will be looking forward to that.”</p>

      <p>The 34 year old stared a campaign online in the hopes that Westlife would see it and make her final dream come true.</p>
      <p>Mairead continued: “I was shaking with nerves, I was worried about what way they might be towards me but they were calling my name, they knew all about me.”</p>
      <p>““They came over and were hugging me, kissing me and taking selfies. It was the best day of my life.”</p>
      <p>Mairead spent over an hour with the band, chatting and singing before the show.</p>
