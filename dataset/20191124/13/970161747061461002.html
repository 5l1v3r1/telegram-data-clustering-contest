        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a>’s Molly-Mae Hague has come under fire yet again after using a foundation that is way too dark for her natural skin tone.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The influencer has disappointed fans after her latest make-up tutorial had her using a foundation shade that a lot of black and Asian people use, bringing up the question of why she feels the need to be darker than she actually is.</p>
      <p>Describing her everday routine, the 20-year-old said: ‘I’ve really been enjoying Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk but this is too dark for me so I’m going to be mixing it with my studio fix fluid from MAC which is a holy grail of mine I use it all the time and this is in the shade NC42 which is still very dark.</p>
      <p>‘I often get lots of comments on how my face is too dark.’</p>

      <p>She sparked fury when fans noticed the drastic difference between her natural skin colour and the colour she desired to be.</p>
      <p>Defending why she uses such a dark shade, Molly explained: ‘I go very pale in the winter time and obviously now it’s getting colder, it’s getting wintery, so I’ve gotten quite pale.</p>
      <p>‘Once my foundation is on, and the whole world has hated me for how orange my face is…’</p>

      <p>Fans and viewers took to Twitter to discuss the problems of turning yourself a different skin colour and deeming it a ‘tan’.</p>
      <p>One user commented: ‘She uses nc42 which is the LIGHTER bottle she’s holding … i’m punjabi and i’m NC30. i know black women and asian women who are NC42. lol. you can defend this all you want but it’s actual madness &amp; FYI it doesn’t look believable for one second. you are all orange blud [sic].’</p>
      <p>‘“I gO vErY pAlE iN tHe WiNtEr” that’s her NATURAL shade ffs,’ another user angrily tweeted. ‘Imagine history calling dark skin ugly only for people to try and mimick it. Black &amp; POC women – embrace your beauty. It’s hated because it’s envied.’</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, some were confused on whether the Love Island star was joking about her ‘holy grail’ shade.</p>
      <p>One fan commented: ‘Is this satire? There’s no way she actually believes it’s a match… It’s like 10 shades too dark.’</p>
