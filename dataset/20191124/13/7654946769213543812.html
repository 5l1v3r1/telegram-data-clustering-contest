      <p>An off-duty NYPD sergeant was slashed multiple times and robbed after a fender-bender in Astoria Sunday morning and his attacker is on the loose, cops said.</p>
      <p>The collision happened just before 5 a.m. near Steinway Street and Northern Boulevard, according to police.</p>
      <p>Following the crash, a man got out of his car and attacked the cop — identified by police sources as Terrance Howard, an anti-crime sergeant in the 69 — and stole his jewelry, police sources told The Post.</p>
      <p>Howard suffered cuts to his face and back and was taken to Cornell Hospital in Manhattan for minor injuries, sources said.</p>
      <p>The attacker and another unknown woman took off after the encounter, according to police.</p>
      <p>Nassau County Police caught up the attacker’s car near Roosevelt, Long Island, where the man took off on foot, escaping arrest, according to the sources.</p>
