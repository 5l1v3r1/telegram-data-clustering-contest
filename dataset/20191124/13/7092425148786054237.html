        <b>Borussia Dortmund are trying to get a jump on their rivals to sign Troy Parrott.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dortmund snapped up Jadon Sancho from Manchester City two years ago and the English youngster has blossomed since, earning himself England caps in the process.</p>
      <p>The German giants are now hoping to fend off <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/soccer-news/borussia-dortmund-join-transfer-race-20946777">competition</a> from fellow Bundesliga juggernauts Bayern Munich, Italian champions Juventus and Zinedine Zidane's Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>Parrott arrived at Spurs from Belvedere two years ago and has starred for their youth teams. He has made only one senior appearance competitively, however, in the Carabao Cup against Colchester, which Spurs lost.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old also got his first Ireland cap in a friendly against New Zealand earlier this month and impressed in the 3-1 win, although he didn't manage to get on the scoresheet.</p>

      <p>The forward signed his first professional deal in February, but that runs out in 2021 and many of Europe's top clubs have been tracking his progress.</p>
      <p>Bundesliga clubs have looked to the Premier League in recent years to seek out stars with untapped potential who aren't getting much game time at senior level.</p>
      <p>Sancho is the most well-know example of this but other players have been successful after making the jump.</p>
      <p>Ademola Lookman signed for RB Leipzig after impressing on loan from Everton while Serge Gnabry is now one of Bayern Munich's highest rated talents after moving back to his home country after failing to find form at Arsenal and West Brom.</p>
