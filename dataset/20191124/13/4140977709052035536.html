          <p>While not many would have thought of India’s first day-night Test match with the pink ball ending under seven sessions, the same happening speaks highly about India’s domination in the format these days.</p>

                <p>In what was an otherwise highly successful event, a chink in the armour appeared when former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar and renowned commentator Harsha Bhogle argued over the visibility of the pink ball while calling the match.</p>
                <p>“When there’s a post mortem done of this game and there should be a post mortem of this game, visibility of that ball will be a big factor against the white sight screen,” Bhogle said while commentating on Day 3.</p>

                      <p>“Don’t think so because when you see the slip catches, I don’t think visibility is an issue at all. The texture of the ball is the issue. You think Virat Kohli wasn’t seeing the ball properly,” Manjrekar replied against what Bhogle said.</p>
                      <h3>“You need to ask Harsha…”</h3>
                      <p>Bhogle was then heard laying emphasis on asking not just India captain Virat Kohli but all other cricketers as well. While Bhogle continued to express his opinion, Manjrekar continued to oppose him eventually saying that former players get a fair idea by watching the match.</p>

                          <p>“Well, you need to ask, Harsha. For us, who’ve played the game get a fair idea about what’s happening out there. I’ve been cricket for two and a half days, I don’t think visibility is an issue. We’ve seen some terrific catches taken in the slips,” Manjrekar added.</p>
                          <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148">
                            <p>“There’s a reason I’d ask everyone because when you’ve played the game, you get a very good idea of what’s happened or what the conditions are but it cannot be a limitation to learning.</p>
                            <p>“If you had only asked players, there would have never been T20 cricket. You’ve never have heard day-night cricket. Sometimes, it’s better to ask everyone what they think and then justify your hypothesis rather than rolling it out before asking,” Bhogle replied.</p>
                            <p>“Point taken but don’t agree,” Manjrekar ended the conversation.</p>
