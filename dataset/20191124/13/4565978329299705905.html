      <p>Las Tunas, Cuba.- That committee presented a rigorous and detailed report on the matter at the Ordinary Session of the Governing Body, recently held. Perhaps they have already solved many of the more than 20 problems found in the municipalities, which gives an idea of the indispensable correction in the respective territories to avoid similar pitfalls, especially when some remain from previous years.</p>
      <p>Such a noble program, initiated by the State in 2011, has since allocated 207 million 240 thousand 500 pesos in Las Tunas, to help families with low monetary income. At the same time, it records questioned evils, led by delay in the granting process by the Municipal Councils of the Administration; and the allocation of financial amounts below what is necessary to pay for labor, which conspires against homes termination and greatly affects the beneficiaries' pockets.</p>
      <p>The anomalies are extended to the building material stores, where the concerns are related to individuals who are rounding around with the intention of acquiring products for resale them at higher prices, the poor quality of some assortments, and the existence of stockrooms with an unfavorable image.</p>
      <p>Despite the measures adopted, there are still criticisms over the amount of procedures that must be carried out, mainly, to start constructions; similarly, about slowness in the in the delivery of projects and licenses by the directorates of Physical Planning, which annoys those in need of such documents to start building their homes.<br/>Although local production of construction materials has a high priority in the eight territories, the results are the same, and such reason influences the uneven progress in compliance with the scheduled plans.</p>
      <p>The slowness of agencies responsible for confronting illegalities continues to be worrying, as 100 of the recommendations about problems to be eradicated still remain; and the instability of technicians of the Housing Directorate persists in certain localities, which reduces the scope of their advisory in the communities.</p>
      <p>In spite of the dilemmas found in the municipalities, the evaluating commission of the matter recognizes general advances, but considers that they could be superior if those involved had applied more intentionality, monitoring, rigor and decision in the eradication of obstacles.</p>
      <p>The real panorama alerts the institutions in charge of the program to increase control, and demands to leave behind the inconsistencies, which tarnish the aim of the State, and delay benefiting people who needs a house.</p>
