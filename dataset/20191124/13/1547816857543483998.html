        <b>From Dwayne Johnson AKA The Rock’s bed to the cast of Jumanji, Nick Jonas’ good-looking cardboard is everywhere!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nick Jonas is everywhere these days, and we aren’t complaining! Only a few days to go until his upcoming film Jumanji makes it to the big screens and the cast of the film are neck-deep into the promotions. But hey, they are minus Nick Jonas himself! And the pop star seems to have no issues with that because his good-looking cardboard is compensating all the loss. A while ago, we spotted him on Dwayne Johnson AKA The Rock’s bed and now, it has reached to the remaining cast of Jumanji. (ALSO READ - <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/hollywood/hollywood_news/nick-jonas-caught-sleeping-with-dwayne-johnson-but-the-rock-calls-kevin-hart-an-a-e/5dd8f94e0cada251e9c31196">Nick Jonas Caught Sleeping With Dwayne Johnson But The Rock Calls Kevin Hart An A***E</a>)</p>
      <p>Taking to his Instagram account, the Sucker singer shared a picture of the Jumanji team comprising of Karen Gillan, Awkwafina and Jack Black posing with his cardboard that was all smiles and excited. And, for a second, we thought that it’s the singer himself. In his caption, Nick Jonas wrote how they are missing him badly amid the Jumanji tour, hence posing with his cardboard. “They must really miss me on the Jumanji press tour. #jumanjithenextlevel.” Check out the picture below:</p>

He wrote how he will tell his kids about the formation, breakup and the reunion of his band The Jonas Brothers. “I’m gonna tell my kids this is a guy that was really happy because he and his brothers had a band and then they broke up, but then they got back together years later and their lives were enriched artistically and emotionally. He never could have imagined how fortunate he would be to be back on stage with his brothers in front of the worlds greatest fans every night doing what he loves. Thank you to everyone who continues to makes this story so much sweeter every day. May the happiness continue. #happinessbeginstour,” read his post.</p>
