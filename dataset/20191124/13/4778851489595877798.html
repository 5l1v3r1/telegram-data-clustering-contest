      <p>However, that didn't stop captain Scott Brown from teasing the Dutchman about a weaker aspect of his game as the two players talked to the Celtic TV after the game.</p>
      <p>Brown said: "He's been fantastic since he came in. All the lads get a buzz off him in the changing room as well, he's a great wee lad.</p>
      <p>"His shooting is pathetic, but everything else about his game has been incredible.</p>
      <p>"The energy he brings - his pace going down the line - is brilliant and his composure as well for being so young."</p>
