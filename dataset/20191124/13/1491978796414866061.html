        <i>Ajax and Heracles players stood still for the first minute after kick-off, as part of an anti-racism protest across the Netherlands' top two divisions. The protests came after Excelsior player Ahmad Mendes Moreira was subject to racist abuse by Den Bosch supporters. A message reading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/21/dutch-clubs-stand-still-protest-racism-football">'Racism? Then we don't play football'</a> was displayed on the screen at the Johan Cruyff Arena.</i>
