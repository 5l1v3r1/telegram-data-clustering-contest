      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/larsa-pippen/">Larsa Pippen</a> delighted her fans over the weekend when she rocked a skimpy pair of Daisy Dukes in her latest Instagram update, which was posted to her account on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Larsa looked smoking hot as she stood on a brick porch in front of a door, while directing a seductive look to the camera. The former <i>Real Housewives</i> star wore a pair of dark-washed denim cutoffs that flaunted her long, lean legs, and paired the shorts with a black tank top.</p>
      <p>The shirt boasted a low cut that showcased the model’s ample cleavage. Larsa also opted for a black jacket, which she wore off of her shoulder to add a little more sex appeal to the snap. She also accessorized the look with some calf-high black leather boots and a diamond chain around her neck.</p>
      <p>The Kardashian BFF had her long, blond hair parted in the center and styled in soft curls that fell down her back and brushed over her shoulders.</p>
      <p>Larsa added a full face of makeup for the photo, an application which consisted of darkened eyebrows, thick lashes, and a shimmering eye shadow. She completed the glam look with a bronzed glow, pink blush on her cheeks, and a nude lip.</p>
      <p>Of course, Larsa’s 1.8 million followers loved the picture and made quick work of showing their appreciation for the post. It gained nearly 15,000 likes and more than 150 comments in less than 24 hours after it was posted to the platform.</p>
