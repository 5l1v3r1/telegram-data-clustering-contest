      <p>The rebooted theatrical saga to one of anime's most illustrious series is finally coming to an end.</p>
      <p>As reported by <a href="http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201911230013.html">The Asahi Shimbun</a>, the fourth and final <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/Evangelion/"><i>Evangelion</i></a> movie will debut in summer 2020. Titled <i>Evangelion 3.0+1.0</i>, the film was first unveiled at the Japan Expo in Paris on July 16. Fans who attended the event got an exclusive chance to view the first 10 minutes and 40 seconds of the movie. Recently, however, a second teaser trailer (in addition to some new posters and artwork) was showcased at a plethora of Japanese theaters.</p>

      <p>Previous films in the reboot series included <i>Evangelion 1.0: You Are (Not) Alone</i>, <i>Evangelion 2.0: You Can (Not) Advance</i> and <i>Evangelion 3.0: You Can (Not) Redo</i>. Much like the original critically acclaimed television show, <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i>, the film saga follows young Eva pilot Shinji Ikari as he battles supernatural entities called Angels. In addition to partaking in bombastic mecha fights, Shinji must learn to successfully navigate social interactions with his superiors and peers, while coping with the psychological trauma of combat.</p>
      <p><i>Evangelion 3.0+1.0</i> is directed by the legendary Hideaki Anno, and, like past installments, Studio Khara is returning to produce the film. The movie comes to theaters in summer 2020.</p>
