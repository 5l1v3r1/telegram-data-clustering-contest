      <h1>Manchester City 'send scouts to watch Sandro Tonali'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/"><b>Manchester City</b></a> have reportedly sent a scout to monitor the development of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/brescia/"><b>Brescia</b></a> midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sandro-tonali/"><b>Sandro Tonali</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Over the past 18 months, the 19-year-old has established himself as one of Italian football's top prospects, with his performances helping Brescia regain their place in Serie A.</p>
      <p>Tonali, who has already made his debut for his national team, has since contributed one goal and two assists from 11 outings in the top flight.</p>
      <p>As a result of increased interest in his signature, <i>Gazzetta dello Sport</i> claims that City will have representatives at Brescia's league clash with Roma on Sunday.</p>
      <p>While a bid is not expected in January, City will want to make decisions on their potential summer transfer targets as soon as possible.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> are also said to have watched Tonali since the beginning of the campaign.</p>
