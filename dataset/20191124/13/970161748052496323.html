      <p>A paramedic who suggested a woman suffering a miscarriage could put her stillborn baby in a ‘Tupperware box’ has been struck off.</p>
      <p>Lucy Bambridge horrified the woman and her husband with a number of inappropriate comments after she was called to their home, a disciplinary hearing found.</p>
      <p>The unnamed patient was told her baby had died at the Rosy Maternity Unit of Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, and she was sent home and asked to return 48 hours later to deliver the stillborn.</p>
      <p>But she rang 999 after suffering contractions and bleeding, and delivered the stillborn while Ms Bambridge and a colleague were in her home.</p>
      <p>A Health and Care Professionals Service Tribunal hearing was told ‘Colleague A’ left Ms Bambridge with the patient in her bedroom to go to the bathroom.</p>
      <p>Colleague A, an emergency medical technician, then recalled hearing screaming coming from the bathroom and returned to find a large amount of blood on the floor.</p>

      <p>‘I do not know if Lucy Bambridge thought she was whispering but she looked at me and said “I don’t know what to do” or words to that effect with her hands facing outwards,’ she said in a witness statement.</p>

      <p>The patient told the tribunal: ‘I can’t begin to tell you how terrifying it is to hear that in a situation like this.</p>
      <p>‘There was a bit of confusion with the clothes I was wearing. They helped me out of them. Obviously we had to be careful of our baby and I was trying not to look or let it fall.</p>
      <p>‘During my distress at this I was horrifically asked if we had anything to put our baby in. “A Tupperware box or something in your kitchen?” We were speechless.</p>
      <p>‘They giggled nervously. Regardless of how awkward this situation was for them this was by no means a time to laugh.’</p>
      <p>The hearing heard how Ms Bambridge knelt forward and said: ‘At least it’s not poo! We are bored of poo! And anyway, red is festive.’</p>

      <p>The patient also blasted her treatment during the procedure to detach her umbilical cord.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘You can imagine my surprise and shock when the pair of scissors was waved in celebration with a big grin in the direction of my husband, implying that he could do it for them. I just looked up at her and said, “you must be joking”.</p>

      <p>‘They went to cut the cord. The girl holding the scissors said to me, “Let’s get this cut. You don’t want all of this hanging out of you do you?” Another unforgivable remark.’</p>
      <p>Ms Bambridge resigned the next month and now lives in Australia.</p>
      <p>In a statement to the panel she said: ‘I feel deeply saddened that the patient feels this way regarding this incident, at the time I did the best I could with the limited training I had received from the trust.</p>
      <p>‘I had no intention of ever making anyone feel uncomfortable or unduly distressed. I have always maintained a high standard of professionalism required of me.’</p>
