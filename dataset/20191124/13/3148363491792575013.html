      <p>German news agency dpa reported Sunday the woman and children, whose identities were not revealed, arrived Saturday night in Frankfurt from Irbil in Iraq.</p>
      <p>It is believed they were in a detention camp in northern Syria.</p>
      <p>Authorities said the woman would be investigated among other things for her membership in the IS group, but that there was no arrest warrant for her.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Turkey stepped up the return of suspected foreign IS members back to their countries of origin.</p>
      <p>Germany has said it will check the background of all suspected Islamic State group members deported back to Germany to assess the risks they pose.</p>
