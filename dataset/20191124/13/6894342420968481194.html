      <h1>Huawei Y9s Officially Confirmed For Malaysia: Features 48MP Main Camera and Kirin 710F Processor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T13:53:22+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 13:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/chapree/" target="_blank">Chief Chapree</a></address>
      <p>Around one year ago, <b>Huawei</b> has released a <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2018/173020/huawei-y9-2019-malaysia-price-official/">mid-range phone called Y9 2019 into Malaysia</a>. Soon, its successor which is called the <b>Huawei Y9s</b> will be making its way into our market very soon as per what <b>Huawei Malaysia</b> has revealed through <a href="https://web.facebook.com/HuaweimobileMY/photos/a.220278888000302/2972892136072283/">its Facebook page</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/HuaweiMobileMY/status/1198579518534873088">Twitter recently</a>.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Huawei didn’t label this phone as a 2020 model as per what it has done for <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/190396/huawei-y9-prime-2019-malaysia-price/">Y9 Prime 2019</a>, Y9 2019, and <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2018/157295/huawei-y9-2018-official-four-cameras-4000mah-battery-android-oreo-board/">Y9 2018</a>. Nevertheless, the Y9s does come with several features that made it so much different from the Y9 2019.</p>

      <p>For example, the new Y9s comes with a triple camera setup on its rear which includes 48MP f/1.8 main camera alongside 8MP f/2.4 ultra-wide and 2MP depth cameras. There’s also the 16MP f2.2 popup selfie camera which allows Huawei to deliver notch-less full screen experience for 6.59-inch Full HD LTPS display on Y9s.</p>
      <p>Powered by Kirin 710F processor with 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage, the Y9s also comes side-mounted fingerprint scanner and 4000mAh battery <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/en/phones/y9s/">according to Huawei’s global website</a>. Meanwhile, Huawei Malaysia has yet to reveal the official pricing of Y9s though, so stay tuned for further information coming your way soon.</p>
