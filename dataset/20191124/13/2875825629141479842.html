      <p>Deontay Wilder believes he hits harder than Mike Tyson following his stunning one-punch knockout of Luis Ortiz.</p>
      <p>The heavyweight world champion knocked out the Cuban in the seventh round having lost each of the previous six.</p>
      <p>Ortiz was able to rise from the canvas but could not beat the referee's count and the fight was waved off.</p>
      <p>Tyson is widely considered to be the biggest puncher in the history of the division, but Wilder claimed he has overtaken his predecessor.</p>
      <p>"At this point in time you've got to give me my credit," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's sad that it took me over 40 fights to get the recognition I truly deserve.</p>

      <p>"When people see me they've never seen my style and I know it took a while for them to get used to what I display and the talents I possess.</p>
      <p>"What I do is not textbook, you can't really reach it and that's what makes me unique and different to other fighters.</p>
      <p>"At this point in time I've earned my due respect and credit. I am the hardest-hitting puncher in boxing history, period, and I've earned that.</p>

      <p>"Consistently I do what I do time and time again, give people great fights and great knockouts."</p>
      <p>Wilder will now turn his attention to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> whom he will rematch in Las Vegas on February 22.</p>
      <p>And he insists the quick turnaround will help rather than hinder his preparations.</p>

      <p>"Every time a person fights we see different holes, you're not going to be perfect in a fight," he added.</p>
      <p>"I hope he took notes and takes them back to camp because I'm going to knock Fury out like I did the first time.</p>
      <p>"I'm proven; if these guys are so sure about certain things, he would have taken the rematch immediately. I demanded it as soon as possible, especially when it was a controversial decision.</p>
