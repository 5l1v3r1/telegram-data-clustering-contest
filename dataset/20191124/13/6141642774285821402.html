      <p>Georgi Mottram, who has been touring the globe with her group Ida Girls, is due to take to the stage with her three co-stars on 7 December.</p>
      <p>Miss Mottram, who hosted this year’s JEP Pride of Jersey Awards alongside former England footballer and Jerseyman Graeme Le Saux, said the show would feature a range of different songs – from Christmas classics to those heard in the West End.</p>
      <p>‘We will also be performing a number of well-known hits [from shows] such as the Greatest Showman, Phantom of the Opera and Frozen,’ she said.</p>
      <p>The singer also revealed that the group would be debuting their new single, called Home, at the show.</p>
      <p>‘There are no direct references to Jersey, but it is all about home and how your heart is back home and how you always dream about going home,’ Miss Mottram said.</p>
      <p>‘It was written while we were on tour and travelling around lots of different countries.’</p>
