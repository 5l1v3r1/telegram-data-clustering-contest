      <h1>UAE exploring opportunities for investment in CPEC projects: Chinese envoy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:51:18+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>China and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are exploring opportunities for cooperation under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Chinese ambassador to Islamabad Yao Jing said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <i><a href="https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1588651/pakistan">Arab News</a></i>, the ambassador stressed that UAE was also a partner under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and has a lot of trade and economic links with Pakistan.</p>
      <p>The BRI is a Beijing-led program to boost economic and trade ties in dozens of countries in Asia, Europe and beyond, mostly through investments in energy and infrastructure.</p>
      <p>“Between China and UAE, maybe we have some opportunities to cooperate for Pakistan’s development,” Ambassador Yao said, adding that since the ninth meeting of a Pakistan China Joint Cooperation Committee held this month, both countries had stepped up efforts to promote “third party investment” in the bilateral project.</p>

      <p>Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Senator Syed Shibli Faraz welcomed investment from UAE and other Arab countries in Pakistan.</p>
      <p>“The government was discussing opportunities for Arab countries to join CPEC,” said Faraz. They had shown “willingness,” he added.</p>
      <p>Mushahid Hussain Syed, Senator and Chairman of China-Pakistan Institute, said the participation of friendly countries like UAE would be a “great plus” for CPEC.</p>
      <p>In an earlier interview, UAE deputy head of mission in Islamabad, Abdul Aziz Al Neyadi, said that UAE and China had common interests and were “ready to jointly work in a third country, as the government of UAE and China enjoy strong relations with Pakistan.”</p>
      <p>UAE Ambassador to Pakistan, Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al-Zaabi, also said, “Pakistan and UAE need to work together to further upgrade their ties aiming at developing a strategic partnership.”</p>

      <p>The first phase of the corridor focused on the development of infrastructure and electricity projects and the second phase will be oriented towards industrialisation and socio-economic development in nine special economic zones across the country.</p>
