      <h1>Police set to impose Rp 250,000 fine on wayward e-scooter riders starting Nov. 25</h1>

      <p>While the Jakarta administration drafts a regulation that will restrict the operation of micromobility vehicles, Jakarta Police will move a step forward with a plan to slap fines of Rp 250,000 [US$17.74] starting on Monday on users who ride them outside the designated areas.</p>
      <p>The police said the sanction was in accordance with articles 282 and 104 of Law No. 22/20009 on traffic and transportation.</p>
      <p>Jakarta Police spokesperson Yusri Yunus said e-scooters could only be used in several designated areas, such as the Gelora Bung Karno sports complex.</p>
      <p> “Those who ride electric scooters outside the designated areas have until now only been given a warning. Starting on Nov. 25, however, we will fine violators,” he said on Sunday as quoted by <i>kompas.com.</i></p>
      <p>“Violators could face a one-month jail sentence and a maximum fine of Rp 250,000,” he said.</p>
      <p>The popular GrabWheels electric scooters rented out by ride-hailing company Grab Indonesia are no longer allowed to freely roam the streets of Jakarta as the city administration is set to restrict the two-wheelers following the deaths of two users in a traffic accident last week.</p>
      <p>The planned regulation will contain detailed rules on the use of e-scooters and other micromobility vehicles such as skateboards, inline skates and conventional scooters; it aims to ensure security, safety and public order, according to the Jakarta Transportation Agency’s traffic management head, Priyanto.</p>
      <p>The decree, set to be issued next month, according to him, would restrict the use of micromobility vehicles to bike lanes and within certain complexes. The modes of transportation would not be allowed on footbridges and must operate at a maximum speed of 20 kilometers per hour.</p>
      <p>Adding to that, riders should also comply with safety rules, such as wearing helmets. </p>
      <p>Those who violate other traffic rules could be fined up to Rp 500,000 (US$35). (rfa)</p>
