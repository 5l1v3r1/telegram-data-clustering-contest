      <h1>How Oregon's Pac-12 loss to Arizona State impacts College Football Playoff picture</h1>

      <p>No. 6 Oregon watched their College Football Playoff hopes evaporate at Arizona State in a 31-28 loss on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Justin Herbert threw two costly interceptions, and the Ducks fell out of the one-loss line despite a furious fourth-quarter comeback. That complicates the College Football Playoff path for the Pac-12 champion now, as well as Alabama and the Big 12 champion.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Here is how Oregon's loss impacts the playoff picture:</p>
      <h3>Alabama rejoices</h3>
      <p>The Crimson Tide still face hurdles to get that last spot in the Playoff, but this was one of the bigger pieces.</p>
      <p>Oregon had a better path to the Playoff as a one-loss team, and now that is gone. Alabama still needs Georgia to lose in the SEC championship game, however, but a new team is going to sneak in the No. 6 spot. The question is whether the committee will put Utah there, or if it will be another big brand in line for a conference championship.</p>
      <h3>Oklahoma does too</h3>
      <p>The Sooners can win the Big 12 championship as a one-loss team, and they have one of the nation's best offenses led by Heisman Trophy candidate Jalen Hurts.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma would not have won the last argument against a one-loss Oregon team that won the Pac-12 championship. The Sooners, however, could bump Utah off given season-ending matchups against ranked teams in Oklahoma State and Baylor.</p>
      <h3>Utah is Pac-12's last hope</h3>
      <p>The Utes needed Oregon to make the Pac-12 championship game so the conference would have a blockbuster matchup between one-loss teams. That puts a damper on that, and it also leaves the Utes in a tough spot.</p>
      <p>Yes, Utah is a one-loss team that bounced from a loss to USC and has played with a no-frills approach that has kept them in the mix under Kyle Whittingham. That might not resonate with the committee as much.</p>
      <p>The Utes, however, would not be a lock to snag that last Playoff spot ahead of the Crimson Tide or Sooners because of the strength of schedule in the Pac-12. They also need to beat Colorado to get in the Pac-12 championship game by virtue of the loss to the Trojans. The one-loss argument just became much more interesting, assuming chalk holds. Who would you take out of Alabama, Oklahoma and Utah if it comes to that?</p>
      <h3>Oregon can still go to Rose Bowl</h3>
      <p>How costly was the loss for Oregon?</p>
      <p>If the Utes don't make the College Football Playoff, then the Pac-12 championship will be for a spot in the Rose Bowl. The Ducks need that one just to stay in the New Year's Day 6.</p>
      <p>The program has rebuilt under Mario Cristobal and is taking steps in the right direction. Oregon, however, is not immune to a costly upset. This one came at the worst time.</p>
