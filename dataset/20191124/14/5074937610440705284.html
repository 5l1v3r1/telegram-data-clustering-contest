      <p>Sekondi, Nov. 24. GNA - The Department of Social Welfare in collaboration with the Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolitan Assembly has distributed items worth GH¢34,650. 00 to a total of 37 Persons with Disabilities (PWD's) in Sekondi.</p>
      <p>The distribution, which formed part of the last batch for the last quarter of 2019 is in fulfilment of government's promise of improving the lives of persons living with disabilities to enable them become part of the mainstream society as stated in the Disability Act of 2006(Act 715).</p>
      <p>The beneficiaries received support in items such as laptops, toiletries, provisions, popcorn machines, ice chests, chest freezer, bags of sachet water among others.</p>
      <p>Mr. Anthony K. K. Sam, Metropolitan Chief Executive (MCE)of STMA, presenting the items to beneficiaries stated that three percent of the District Assembly's common fund, which was allocated to PWDs was used in purchasing the items for the beneficiaries.</p>
      <p>He explained that the money was gathered quarterly to enable the Assembly accrue enough funds to be used in buying the items needed by the beneficiaries since the money came in tranches. </p>
      <p>Mr. Sam explained that the presentation was done in batches due to the large numbers of the beneficiaries, adding that a need assessment list was compiled to make the distribution of the items less stressful.</p>
      <p>The MCE said a person cannot benefit from the support proramme for more than once and advised the beneficiaries to put whatever they received to good use to improve on their livelihood and become independent.</p>
      <p>Mr Sam cautioned the PWDs who operated shops and other buying and selling businesses not to sell their goods on credit basis to avoid the collapse of their businesses .</p>
      <p>He further cautioned them to exercise due diligence in their business in order to sustain its growth and development.</p>
      <p>Mr Alex Moro, a beneficiary expressed gratitude to the Assembly for providing them with their share of the national cake and urged his fellow PWDs to utilise the items given to wean themselves from families and the Department of Social welfare.</p>
