      <p>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Hundreds of Florida kids are missing, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.</p>
      <p>All 345 of them were honored at the capitol Friday morning for the 21st Missing Children’s Day.</p>
      <p>The annual event brings attention to families still looking for their loved ones and highlights the efforts of others to bring kids home.</p>
      <p>Dan Campbell’s 14-year-old Wendy Hudakoc disappeared in 1998. The Naples father has been coming to the event each year since.</p>
      <p>“Some years, it feels like it’s getting a little easier," he said. "Then you have a year where it just tugs on your heartstrings.”</p>
      <p>That pain has turned into advocacy for Campbell. He now sees his trips as an opportunity to reflect on what was lost and how he can help others.</p>
      <p>“This can happen anywhere at any time," Campbell said. "Wendy had a history of saying, ‘Nothing bad ever happens to us.’ We believed that too, until 21 years ago last week.”</p>
      <p>With the legislature starting up in January, Campbell felt Florida was moving in the right direction, but said more could always be done to help victims and families.</p>
      <p>At the moment, however, state lawmakers are focusing on curbing gun violence. None of the more than 2,000 bills proposed for the 2020 session directly tie to missing children.</p>
      <p>First Lady Casey DeSantis, who’s taken up a mission of helping children, said following the event she would like to hear some.</p>
      <p>“If legislators have some good things that we can do to try and bring these kids home— I’m all ears," Casey DeSantis said. "I think it’s a priority, we have got to make sure we’re doing what we can.”</p>
      <p>Gov. Ron DeSantis’ recent budget proposal could indirectly help. He’s asking for millions to enhance Florida’s crime database and to create threat assessment teams stopping violence before it happens.</p>
      <p>GOP leadership in the House and Senate largely praised the Republican's budget proposal. Democrats said getting educators pay raises was a top priority, one of DeSantis' major goals for next year.</p>
