      <p><b>Matchup: <a href="https://www.nhl.com/sabres/stats/">Buffalo Sabres</a></b> (10-9-3) vs. <a href="https://www.nhl.com/panthers/stats"><b>Florida Panthers</b></a> (12-6-5)</p>
      <p><b>Where</b>: BB&amp;T Center, Sunrise, Fla.</p>
      <p><b>When:</b> 5 p.m.</p>
      <p><b>TV:</b> MSG.</p>
      <p><b>Radio:</b> WGR 550.</p>
      <p><b>Crowded blue line:</b> Sabres coach Ralph Krueger used practice Saturday to "play with some looks" on the blue line. Rasmus Dahlin was reunited with Zach Bogosian, who could make his season debut against the Panthers. Colin Miller was also playing his off-side on a pairing with Brandon Montour.</p>
      <p>Jake McCabe remained with Rasmus Ristolainen and the same goes for Marco Scandella with Henri Jokiharju. It remains unclear whom will be scratched now that John Gilmour has joined the Rochester Americans.</p>
      <p>Krueger told the media following practice Saturday in Coral Springs., Fla., that Bogosian is expected to play either Sunday against Florida or Monday in Tampa Bay. That decision won't be made until Sunday morning. Is Krueger willing to change the defense pairs after the Sabres played well during a loss Thursday night in Boston?</p>
      <p>While the fan base views the crowded blue line as a problem, Krueger and General Manager Jason Botterill have maintained their opinion that this is a necessary asset. Neither said he is concerned about what sort of effect this will have on team chemistry, either.</p>
      <p>"It’s part of being a team," Krueger said. "You’re not always going to like the role you have, the ice time you get or if you’re then scratched, but how do you react to that and how do you still support your teammates? So far we’ve seen nothing but support from players that haven’t been called up to play in a game and are watching from the outside. They’re the first guys in the room to greet the guys coming off the ice at the end of the game."</p>
      <p><b>Potential lineup:</b> Though the defense pairs could change, Krueger appears ready to use the same forward lines against the Panthers. Center Marcus Johansson remains away from the team as he recovers from an upper-body injury that has forced him to miss five games.</p>
      <p>That has tested the Sabres' depth down the middle, however, Rasmus Asplund has performed well since being recalled from Rochester. Though Buffalo has lost nine of its last 10 games, Krueger is thrilled with how they performed Thursday in Boston.</p>
      <p>The Bruins had not allowed as few as four shots on goal in one period in almost four years. That's a significant accomplishment against one of the top teams in the National Hockey League. Here is how the Sabres lined up during practice Saturday:</p>

      <p><b>Bogosian ready:</b> Naturally, Bogosian smiled at the first mention of possibly returning to game action.  He hasn't been on the ice against an opponent since March 23 and was limited to 65 games last season.</p>
      <p>Bogosian suffered multiple setbacks in his return from hip surgery last summer, but he could assist the Sabres' penalty kill, which ranks 31st in the NHL during November. Bogosian also formed an excellent pairing with Dahlin last season and can provide the Sabres with the type of physical presence they need.</p>
      <p>"Bogo has been really outstanding to have around, first of all as a person," Krueger said. "Off the ice, he’s very emotional and so far he’s bringing a good spirit in on a daily basis since he’s been in practice. He’s a personality and he’s somebody who can help us moving forward with his experience, his ability to kill penalties and also play the team game. We just look forward, and I’m seeing it more and more in practice, his confidence is going up in practice. I’m sure he’ll be an added asset to us."</p>
      <p><b>Bad history:</b> Since the calendar turned to November, the Panthers are 6-3-1 and their power play ranks fourth in the NHL. Additionally, they have a plus-4 goal differential and their top players are leading the way. Jonathan Huberdeau has three goals among 15 points and Aleksander Barkov has six goals among 14 points during that span.</p>
      <p>The Sabres defeated the Panthers, 3-2, in a shootout on Oct. 11. However, Buffalo has not won two games against Florida in a season since 2016-17. Since then, the Sabres are 2-6-1 against their Atlantic Division rival.</p>
      <p>This would be an opportune time for the Sabres' power play to build off the success it had Thursday night in Boston. The Panthers' penalty kill is converting at a rate of 79.2% since Nov. 1.</p>
      <p><b>Opposing player to watch:</b> Panthers winger Evgenii Dadonov entered Sunday tied for first on the team with 10 goals and his 20 points ranked third. He's also played outstanding against the Sabres during his career, recording six goals among 17 points in 13 games.</p>
