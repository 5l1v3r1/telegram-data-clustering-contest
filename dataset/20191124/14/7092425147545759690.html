        <b>The bosses for I'm a Celeb have reportedly increased the security around the camp after a body was found an hour away.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The body of a 50-year-old man was found at Jake Evans Boat Harbour Park in Tweed Heads.</p>
      <p>A horrified couple came across the man in a sleeping bag while walking their dog and a manhunt has since been launched by the New South Wales police.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Brendon Cullen said that the man had been found with "physical wounds."</p>
      <p>Sources told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10409277/im-a-celeb-security-hunt-killer/">The Sun </a>that the I'm a Celeb bosses are aware of the search and have increased security.</p>

      <p>One source said: "The celebs are being watched 24 hours a day, seven days a week by a team of staff and our security measures are incredibly tight.</p>
      <p>"So there is zero chance of anyone sneaking into camp. But of course it is very unsettling to know that there is someone out there, running from the police, who has committed such a horrible crime."</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Cullen told ABC News: "The movements and the history of the victim is something that we are in the early stages of establishing.</p>
      <p>"We are very keen to speak to any person that was in Jack Evans Boat Harbour yesterday evening and this morning who might have seen something or know anything about this.</p>
      <p>"We do want to establish where this man is from and how he came to be in the state he is in now."</p>
