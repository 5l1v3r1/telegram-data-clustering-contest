      <p>A 14-year-old boy was held on suspicion of obstructing police.</p>
      <p>Officers seized two machetes at the scene and a knife was found at a roundabout near the complex.</p>
      <p>People were evacuated as Vue decided to close the cinema and the company has now axed screenings of the film from all its venues.</p>
      <p>A recorded message on the cinema answerphone says that the movie has been pulled and informs anyone with tickets to stay on the line to speak to a customer service advisor for a refund.</p>
      <p>If you try to book a ticket online an error code comes up.</p>

      <p>“We worked quickly to move the crowds on, but were met with a very hostile response and officers had to draw Tasers to restore order. </p>
      <p>“Thankfully, the injuries to our officers were very minor. We’ve also recovered two machetes and a knife, and it’s clear that some of those who went to Star City last night were intent on causing trouble.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had a great response from the public who have been very supportive of our officers.</p>
      <p>"We understand that families with young children will have been left upset by what they saw last night, but we urge people to appreciate that our aim last night was to protect the public and restore order, and that’s what we achieved.</p>
      <p>“We’re aware of a number of images and videos circulating on social media which appear to show those involved in last night’s violence.</p>
      <p>“We are assessing those and have already had a number of phone calls from members of the public giving us the names of people they believe were involved last night.</p>
      <p>“I’d ask anyone with images or video who has not yet got in touch already to do so that we can make further arrests.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
