      <p>He sought to characterise the election contest as a battle between "retrograde destructive socialism" under Labour and "sensible one nation Conservatism" under the Tories.</p>
      <p>"In this manifesto there is a vision for the future in which we unite our country," he said.</p>
      <p>"It is time to unleash the potential of our country and forge a new Britain."</p>
      <p>The manifesto includes:</p>
      <p>- A "triple tax lock" with no increases in income tax, national insurance and VAT for five years</p>
      <p>- An additional 20,000 police officers and 50,000 extra nurses with the return of nurse bursaries</p>
      <p>- Â£1 billion of additional funding for social care in every year of the next Parliament</p>
      <p>- A new deal for towns, cutting taxes for small high street retailers and installing more CCTV</p>
      <p>- An Australian-style points based system to control immigration after Britain has left the EU</p>
      <p>- A pledge to make the UK carbon neutral by 2050.</p>
