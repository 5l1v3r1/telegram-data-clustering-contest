      <p>A veteran Nollywood actor and filmmaker, Theodore Anyanji, died on Saturday in Lagos.</p>
      <p>The deceased battled a heart and kidney-related ailment for months.</p>
      <p>A fundraiser was announced on his behalf on social media on November 6 but it yielded little or no result.</p>
      <p>The thespian reportedly passed on at a prayer healing church in Festac, Lagos State.</p>
      <p>His body has since been taken to his hometown in Umuaka, Imo State.</p>
      <p>An actor, Valentine Opute, broke the news on Facebook on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He wrote, “Go well Theodore. You fought a good fight. Theodore the Star maker. A perfectionist in all spheres. Last I spoke with you, you sounded strong and promising, not knowing it was a farewell call I gave you. This pricks my heart so deeply I must say. Theodore gave me my first ever major role in a movie in 2008 INDIAN DOCTOR, Just like he did to a lot other now successful actors. The GOLD behind a thousand and one Nollywood evergreen movies. It is well.”</p>
      <p>Mr Anyaji was a member of the Directors Guild of Nigeria and made countless Nollywood hits.</p>
      <p>One of his famous works was ‘Ada Mbano’ which arguably launched the film career of Queen Nwokoye.</p>
      <p>He also directed and scripted projects such as The Plain Truth 2 (2008), Greatest Weapon (2006) and Ihite Kingdom 2 (2014).</p>
