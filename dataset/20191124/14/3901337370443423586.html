        <b>Telkom Knockout Semi-Final</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Teams:</b> Kaizer Chiefs v Maritzburg United</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 24 November 2019<br/><br/><b>Venue:</b> Mbombela Stadium</p>
      <p>A spot in the Telkom Knockout final will be up for grabs when the in-form Kaizer Chiefs host Maritzburg United at the Mbombela Stadium on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The match is scheduled to get underway at 15h00.</p>
      <p>Ernst Middendorp’s charges are in great form both in the Absa Premiership and Telkom Knockout, having won eight straight matches across these two competitions, including two penalty shoot-out wins over Cape Town (last 16) and Orlando Pirates (quarter-finals).</p>
      <p>Despite their cup drought, Chiefs are still the record holders in this competition after winning the League Cup title on 13 occasions, including three in the Telkom Knockout era - which is also a record.</p>
      <p>Amakhosi will be without goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi, defender Erick Mathoho and midfielder Willard Katsande, all due to suspensions but they will welcome back attacking midfielder Kearyn Buccus, who has returned to full fitness after an ankle injury.</p>
      <p>Having a found their form in the Absa Premiership, Eric Tinkler's charges will be looking to continue their run in the League Cup, having defeated Bidvest Wits and Highlands Park on their way to the last four.</p>
      <p>Maritzburg will be without Kwanda Mngonyama due to suspension after the defender was sent off in the side's goalless draw with Orlando Pirates before the FIFA break.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's how they line up:</b>
