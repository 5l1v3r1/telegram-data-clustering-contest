      <h1>Kennedy on whether Ukraine interfered in 2016: 'I don't know, nor do you'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:54:27+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/zack-budryk" target="_blank">Zack Budryk</a></address>
      <p>Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/john-kennedy">John Kennedy</a> (R-La.) on Sunday demurred when asked whether he accepted that Russia, rather than Ukraine, hacked the Democratic National Committee’s server in 2016 in the wake of testimony by ex-National Security Council official Fiona Hill, who said blaming Ukraine was the result of a Russian disinformation campaign.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know, nor do you, nor do any of us,” Kennedy told Fox News’ <a href="https://thehill.com/people/christopher-chris-wallace">Chris Wallace</a> when asked whether he accepted that Russia was responsible for the hack.</p>
      <p>Reminded by Wallace that the entire intelligence community has attributed the hack to Russia, Kennedy replied, “Right, but it could also be Ukraine. Ms. Hill is entitled to her opinion but no rebuttal evidence was allowed to be offered.”</p>
      <p>Kennedy, like numerous Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, noted that the panel had not invited a former U.S. embassy contractor they believe attempted to coordinate with Ukraine’s government to testify.</p>
      <p>In her testimony Friday Hill, an expert on Russia, chided Republicans on the committee for spreading the "fictional narrative" that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for interference in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>Asked about testimony that there was an explicit quid pro quo with Ukraine, Kennedy said a quid pro quo was a “red herring” and repeated his claims that such an arrangement would only be corrupt in intent if it was specifically in service of hurting a political rival rather than “someone who happens to be a political rival.”  </p>
