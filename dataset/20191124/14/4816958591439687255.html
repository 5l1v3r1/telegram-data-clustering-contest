      <p>TELFORD — Britain’s governing Conservative Party will not extend the Brexit implementation period beyond December 2020, it said in its election manifesto on Sunday, reiterating Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s vow to “get Brexit done.”</p>
      <p>“We will negotiate a trade agreement next year – one that will strengthen our Union – and we will not extend the implementation period beyond December 2020,” the party said.</p>
      <p>“The only way to deliver Brexit is with a Conservative majority in parliament,” the manifesto said, adding if in government, people coming to Britain from the EU would only access unemployment, housing and child benefit after five years.
