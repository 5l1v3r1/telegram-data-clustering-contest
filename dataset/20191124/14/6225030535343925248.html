      <p>Trainer Chad Brown’s duo of Klaravich Stables Sands Point (G2) winner <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/New_And_Improved">New and Improved </a></b>and First Row Partners and Hidden Brook Farm’s Parx Fall Oaks victor Nay Lady Nay will invade Churchill Downs from New York to take on 12 rivals in Friday’s 29th rendition of the Grade 2, $300,000 Mrs. Revere, a 1 1/16-mile test for 3-year-old fillies on the Matt Winn Turf Course.</p>
      <p>The Mrs. Revere is scheduled for Race 9 with a post time of 4:57 p.m. ET. The race, named as a tribute to the highly competitive filly Mrs. Revere who collected a total of four Churchill Downs stakes during a two-year reign from 1984-85, shares the spotlight with the Clark (G1), which will run two races later at 5:56 p.m.</p>
      <p>New and Improved (3-2-0-0—$165,500), a gray filly by Cairo Prince, recorded her first stakes victory in the Sands Point at Belmont Park. Joel Rosario will ride the $320,000 purchase from the 2017 Keeneland September Yearling Sale from post position No. 12.</p>
      <p>Ten spots inside of New and Improved is her stablemate Nay Lady Nay (4-2-1-0—$92,200), who scored a 2 ½-length victory in her last start in the Parx Fall Oaks on Oct. 7. The filly by No Nay Never is cross-entered in Aqueduct’s $150,000 Winter Memories Stakes on Thursday. Junior Alvarado has the call on Nay Lady Nay in the Mrs. Revere.</p>
      <p>Another notable entrant to the 12-horse Mrs. Revere is Katsumi Yoshida’s The Mackem Bullet (11-3-2-3—$320,358), who defeated 10 rivals by 1 ¼ lengths in the Appalachian (G2) at Keeneland prior to going on the sidelines for six months. Most recently, the Wesley Ward-trainee finished third in the Valley View (G3) at Keeneland. Tyler Gaffalione has the return call from post 14.</p>
