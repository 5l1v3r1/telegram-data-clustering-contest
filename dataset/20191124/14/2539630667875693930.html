        <b>Podcasters and professional audio processing types may be interested to know that a maintenance release of <a href="https://audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> is available to download.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/New_features_in_Audacity_2.3.3">Audacity 2.3.3</a> serves as the latest stable release of the famous open source audio editor. But the team behind the tool say that this update offers “no new and almost no changed features” when compared to previous builds.</p>
      <p>However, many <b>long standing bug fixes </b>are included thanks to code ‘restructuring’ work. Among the 75+ bugs fixed are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Quality slider now works for AAC/M4A Export</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Leading blank space treated as silence on Export</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Exports are now based on “What you hear is what you get”</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, the <i>Repair</i>, <i>Paulstretch</i>, and <i>Reverb</i> effects should <a href="https://bugzilla.audacityteam.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2191">now be faster</a> on Linux systems; attempting to time shift multiple tracks <a href="https://bugzilla.audacityteam.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2176">no longer results in a crash</a>; while the strange noise inserted during <i>Punch &amp; Roll </i>re-recording <a href="https://bugzilla.audacityteam.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2226">has been solved</a>.</p>
      <p>Among the<b> features removed in Audacity 2.3.3</b> because the app has newer/better/alternatives:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Nyquist Workbench</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Vocal remover effect</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Normalise on load</b>
        </li>
        <li><b>On-demand loading of aliased files</b> (e.g., <code>.wav</code>, <code>.aiff</code>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, the catch-all ‘equalization effect’ has been split into two separate effects: <i>Filter Curve</i> allows users to adjust equalization using curves; <i>Graphical EQ</i> allows users to adjust equalization using sliders.</p>
