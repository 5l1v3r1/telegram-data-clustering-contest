      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:36:01+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:36</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson has reinstated the state bursary for student nurses in a humiliating climbdown on Tory policy.</p>
      <p>The Conservative government scrapped the vital support for trainees just three years ago.</p>
      <p>But already the policy has been branded a disaster, with nurse numbers applying to begin training dropping by 16,580 from March 2016 to September 2018.</p>
      <p>The fall in mature student numbers was even more stark, with a total decline of 40% from June 2016.</p>
      <p>Launching the Tory manifesto in Telford, Mr Johnson pledged to recruit 50,000 extra nurses - and to give them a £5,000 to £8,000 a year maintenance grant.</p>
      <p>The manifesto promises: "And they won't have to pay it back.</p>
      <p>"Everyone will receive at least £5,000 with further funding in regions or disciplines that are struggling to recruit - such as mental health - and help with their childcare costs."</p>

      <p>In his 2015 spending review, George Osborne unveiled “disastrous” plans to scrap £6,000-a-year grants for student nurses and midwives.</p>
      <p>It was supposedly done to allow more training places to open up.</p>
      <p>But hours after the policy was announced, unions warned us it could prompt a recruitment crisis.</p>
      <p>And figures later showed a 23% drop in applications, according to former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> health chief Andy Burnham.</p>
      <p>Tory peers killed off a bid to block the change in their final act before the 2017 <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> .</p>
