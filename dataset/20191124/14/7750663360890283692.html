      <h1>Leeds United considering bid for Burnley forward Matej Vydra?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/burnley/"><b>Burnley</b></a> forward <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/matej-vydra/"><b>Matej Vydra</b></a> has reportedly emerged as a potential January transfer target for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/leeds-united/"><b>Leeds United</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>While Leeds currently sit in second position in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/championship/table.html">Championship table</a>, the Yorkshire giants have only scored 23 goals from their 17 matches.</p>
      <p>Despite having <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/patrick-bamford/"><b>Patrick Bamford</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eddie-nketiah/"><b>Eddie Nketiah</b></a> at his disposal, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marcelo-bielsa/"><b>Marcelo Bielsa</b></a> is said to be keen on strengthening in the final third at the beginning of 2020.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Sun</i>, the Argentine may be prepared to launch a Â£7.5m offer for Vydra, who is out-of-favour at Turf Moor.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old has only been provided with 58 minutes of Premier League football this season, which have come from four outings as a substitute.</p>
      <p>While the Czech Republic international still has over 18 months remaining on his contract, the Clarets may be prepared to cash in on the attacker.</p>
