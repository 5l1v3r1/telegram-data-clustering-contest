      <p>Rivalry Week has arrived in Ann Arbor and Columbus. Michigan is set to host Ohio State in The Game on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes and the Wolverines are surely ready to go. So, too, are their former players.</p>
      <p>The Ohio State-Michigan rivalry never goes away. A couple of former star players reminded everyone of that on Twitter late on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Former Michigan standout Khalid Hill tweeted a photo of himself playing against Ohio State:</p>

      <p>Former Ohio State standout Jayln Holmes responded:</p>
      <p>“When you never beat OSU and you mad about it.”</p>

      <p>Holmes isn’t wrong. Michigan did not win that game. The Wolverines haven’t beaten the Buckeyes since 2011.</p>
      <p>Will that change this year?</p>
      <p>Ohio State and Michigan are set to kick off at noon E.T. on Saturday. The game will be on FOX.</p>
