      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:53:55+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:53</time> by <a rel="author">James Crabtree-Hannigan</a></address>
      <p>Much like his quarterback, Patriots coach Bill Belichick keeps his sons close to him.</p>
      <p>One look at Stephen and Brian Belichickand you can see how the apples never fell far from the tree. Both are members of the Patriots' 2019 coaching staff — Stephen as a safeties coach and Brian as a coaching assistant. Stephen has been with New England since 2012, when he joined the franchise as an assistant.</p>
      <p>"Steve's a guy that's been here and just been a sponge learning everything," Patriots safety Devin McCourtysaid in 2016, via NBC Sports Boston. "It's been cool for me, being here when he got here, just to see how much he's developed and worked hard. And it seems like he's always here."</p>
      <p>So who is Stephen Belichick? We take a closer look at the safeties coach.</p>
      <h3>Who are Bill Belichick's kids?</h3>
      <p>Bill Belichick has three children: Amanda Belichick is the head women's lacrosse coach at Holy Cross, and Stephen and Brian Belichick are on the Patriots' coaching staff.</p>
      <p>Amanda is the oldest, <a href="https://www.telegram.com/news/20180203/holy-cross-lacrosse-coach-amanda-belichick-daughter-of-bill-belichick-relives-super-moments">born in 1984</a>. Stephen is the middle child and Brian is the youngest.</p>
      <p>All three played some college lacrosse; Amanda had by far the best playing career at <a href="https://athletics.wesleyan.edu/sports/wlax/2006-07/bios/belichick_amanda_lfv3">Wesleyan</a>, while Stephen (<a href="https://issuu.com/ruathletics/docs/mlax2011/18">Rutgers</a>) and Brian (<a href="https://www.bantamsports.com/sports/mlax/2012-13/bios/BELICHICK_BRIAN?view=bio">Trinity</a>) barely played.</p>
      <p>Brian made headlines early in the 2019 season when Bills head coach Sean McDermott (a former Patriots assistant) <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/sean-mcdermott-chased-bill-belichicks-son-off-field-during-warmups/ir16dofpijo118mfzjq1ldef4">ushered him off the field</a> prior to New England facing Buffalo.</p>
