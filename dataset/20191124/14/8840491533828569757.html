      <p>COUNTRY music star Mike Denver launched the 20th annual Western Care Valentine’s Candlelight Ball with great exuberance in the TF Royal Theatre.</p>
      <p>An enthusiastic Mike reminded those in attendance that over 1,400 children and adults benefit from the work that Western Care Association carries out across Mayo every day and encouraged people to once again support this important fundraiser, which is in its 20th year and promises to be an excellent night.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the event, Mike said: “I’m delighted to be launching the 20th annual Valentine’s Candlelight Ball in aid of a great organisation – Western Care Association. Put Saturday, February 15, in your diary. Don’t miss out, it’s going to be another great night and all for a great cause.”</p>
      <p>The black tie event, one of the highlights of the social calendar in Mayo, will take place on Saturday, February 15, in Breaffy House Resort and tickets are on sale now.</p>
      <p>Mike was delighted to lend his support to the event and praised Western Care Association for the fantastic work it carries out across Mayo every day.</p>
      <p>Chairperson of the Castlebar Voluntary Branch of Western Care, Dara Dunne, thanked the sponsors for their continued support and especially Brendan and Julie Chambers. He also paid tribute to all the businesses across the county who support the ball and he thanked the organising committee for their ongoing contribution.</p>
      <p>He made a special mention to the four committee members who have been involved since the first ball 20 years ago – Barbara Flynn, Helena Boylan, Henry McGlade and Lorraine Hall.</p>
      <p>Dara told the launch event: “Western Care Association is a Mayo charity deeply rooted in the community and it provides a wide range of services to more than 1,400 children and adults with learning disabilities.</p>
      <p>“Last year we raised just over €25,000 with every penny directly benefitting and enhancing the quality of lives of the people that we supported through various projects. This year, our 20th year, will be a special one and we look forward to welcoming all of our guests to Breaffy House.”</p>
      <p>Dara also thanked Pat Jennings for facilitating and hosting the event’s launch.</p>
      <p>The organising committee were delighted that the cathaoirleach of Castlebar Municipal District, Councillor Michael Kilcoyne, lent his support to the launch.</p>
      <p>This year’s ball will be televised for Sky TV and will be aired shortly afterwards on Henry McGlade’s popular magazine show The Irish At Home and Abroad on Sky 212. The show can be viewed every Thursday night at 7 p.m. and is repeated on Saturday nights at 8 p.m.</p>
      <p>The Valentine’s Candlelight Ball commences with a champagne reception followed by gala dinner, raffle, auction and lots of prizes. Tickets costing €50 are available from Western Care Head Office, John Moore Road, Castlebar; Teresa Ward, fundraising and development manager, on (087) 2467857; or from committee members.</p>
