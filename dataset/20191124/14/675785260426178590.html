      <h1>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer makes transfer decision on Man Utd target Nicolo Zaniolo</h1>
      <h2>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is desperate to bolster his ranks when the window reopens and has prioritised the signing of a new midfielder</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:47:25+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:47</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are willing to pay Roma £52million to sign midfielder Nicolo Zaniolo in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is desperate to bolster his ranks when the window reopens and has prioritised the signing of a new midfielder.</p>
      <p>Zaniolo has been on the Red Devils' radar since early this year when he scored both Roma's goals in a 2-1 Champions League win over Porto - and he caught the eye again with another double in Italy's 9-1 thrashing of Armenia this month.</p>
      <p>And according to <a href="https://www.ilmessaggero.it/video/">Il Messaggero</a> , the Norwegian manager is prepared to pay up to £52m to prise him away from the Italian giants.</p>

      <p>Solskjaer, however, will face competition from Paris Saint-Germain, who are also in the hunt for a new midfield maestro.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a>  need more attacking options after scoring just 16 goals in 12 Premier League games so far this season - and are willing to discuss Zaniola's availability during Chris Smalling talks.</p>
      <p>United defender Smalling has impressed on loan at the Serie A side after finding himself surplus to requirements at Old Trafford, and his temporary move  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/chris-smalling-says-misses-man-20877738">could be made permanent in the summer</a>  .</p>
      <p>And the Red Devils will hope their relationship with Roma can help smooth the way to bring one of Europe's most promising attacking talents to the Premier League.</p>

      <p>Zaniolo can play through the middle or on the right wing, and has scored three goals for Roma in Serie A so far this season.</p>
      <p>But United know they need to move quick if they want to sign the five-cap Italy international, with his stock rising all the time.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are also in the market for a centre forward in the January transfer market, and Roma's former  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a>  striker  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-consider-edin-dzeko-20926301">Edin Dzeko has been touted as a possible alternative</a>  to out-of-favour  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a>  man Mario Mandzukic.</p>
