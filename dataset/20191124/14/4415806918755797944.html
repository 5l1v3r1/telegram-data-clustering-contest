      <p>“The first information in our possession indicates that the plane had 17 passengers on board before failing to take off,” a statement from North Kivu governor Nzanzu Kasivita Carly’s office said.</p>
      <p>It did not give a casualty toll.</p>
      <p>The aircraft was owned by private carrier Busy Bee and was headed to Beni, 220 miles north of Goma in the same province.</p>
      <p>Air accidents are frequent in DR Congo, given poor maintenance and relaxed air safety standards.</p>
