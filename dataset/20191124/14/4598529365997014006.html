      <p>Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was released from Johns Hopkins Hospitalin in Baltimore, Maryland on Sunday, according to Supreme Court spokesperson Kathy Arberg.</p>
      <p>“Justice Ginsburg has been discharged from the hospital,” Arberg said in a statement. “She is home and doing well.”</p>
      <p>Ginsburg was hospitalized on Friday night “after experiencing chills and fever earlier in the day,” Arberg said on Saturday in a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_11-23-19">press release</a>. “She was initially evaluated at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C. before being transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital for further evaluation and treatment of any possible infection.”</p>
      <p>Ginsburg has experienced several health issues over the past year, including <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-cancer-treatment-remarks">cancer</a>. After undergoing three weeks of radiation treatment for a tumor on her pancreas in August, a spokesperson for the court said the tumor was “treated definitively” and that “there is no evidence of disease elsewhere in the body.”</p>
