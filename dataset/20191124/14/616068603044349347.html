      <p>It was a sombre day in downtown Vernon yesterday, as the downtown Safeway officially closed its doors.</p>
      <p>Current and former employees gathered Saturday evening to say goodbye to the store and all the people that worked in it.</p>
      <p>After Dennis McLeod, the store's final official customer, checked out his bananas, peppers and cream cheese, the staff raised glasses to toast the store they knew and loved.</p>
      <p>Manager Sean Watson tried to calculate the math of how many customers have walked through the store over the past 54 years, but couldn't complete the math on it. He praised his staff members for putting the people in the community at top priority from the grand opening to closing day.</p>
      <p>The store pharmacy will remain open in a trailer in the parking lot as the store changes over to a FreshCo, which is slated to open in April.</p>
