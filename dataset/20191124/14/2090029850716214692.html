      <p>According to a social media report, the boy made the fan in a space of two days, but most users are  urging him to do something better than a wooden standing fan.</p>

      <p>*** 15yrs o… Nonsense. Of what importance is it to anybody? The world is now talking about AI and you are here praising one boy that’s just there deceiving himself. Fan of all things, stuff that we did for play when we were younger with not basic knowledge of science sef.</p>

      <p>A seven year old somewhere in Uyo, I think, was featured on BBC OR CNN for his skills in building computer games and here we are celebrating a 15 year old, whose mates, even here in Nigeria are already building complex software programs!</p>
