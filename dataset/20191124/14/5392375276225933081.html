      <p>Huawei MatePad Pro alleged pricing and specifications leaked<br/>4.8 (96.67%) 6 votes</p>
      <p>Huawei’s new flagship table dubbed MatePad Pro is expected to be launched alongside a number of other products at an event on November 25. The forthcoming tablet has been already leaked as well as teased by the company itself confirming a punch-hole, dual rear cameras, and support for M-Pen. Though the launch is only a few hours away, we are subjected to more details about the tablet, thanks to a pre-mature published review from China which has now been taken down.</p>

      <p>The teaser video <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/21/huawei-matepad-pro-official-teaser-video-surfaced-ahead-of-launch/">posted</a> by Huawei a few days back confirmed all the previous leaks including a dual-camera setup at the back, a punch-hole on the top left corner of the display to nest the front camera, and support for input using the company’s M-Pen stylus. And now, the review confirms the presence of HiSilicon Kirin 990 SoC with up to 8GB RAM and 512GB of internal storage. Additionally, the review also reveals some information about the new M-Pen stylus. The new Huawei stylus will bring a ton of improvements including 20ms latency with six in-built gestures and up to 10 hours of usage on a single charge. The stylus will be hexagonal is shape inspired by wooden pencils weighing 14g with a diameter of 160mm. The tip will be made of a special composite material consisting of POM, TPU metal electrode, and other outsourced composite material to offer a better writing experience.</p>

      <p>Apart from the above-mentioned features, a huge 7,250mAh battery will run the MatePad Pro with support for 40W fast charging, faster than any other tablets in the market. Last but not least, it will be available in four colours including White, Blue, Green, and Orange at an expected price tags of 3,699 Yuan(6GB + 128GB), 3,999 Yuan(6GB + 256GB), and 5,499 Yuan(8GB + 512GB) respectively. We do need to point out that the price leak has now been removed from Slashleaks considering it looks speculative. Regardless, the MatePad Pro will surely not come cheap. </p>
