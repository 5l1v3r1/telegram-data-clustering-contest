      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:46:04+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-west/364998-lagos-govt-seals-off-plastic-company-over-workers-death.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The Lagos State Government has sealed off Multipak Nigeria Ltd., a plastic producing factory, for violation of safety rules and regulations, poor house-keeping and lack of signage, which led to the death of a worker.</p>
      <p>The Director-General, Lagos State Safety Commission (LSSC), Lanre Mojola, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The company is located at Plot F8, Kudirat Abiola Way, Oregun, Lagos.</p>
      <p>Signage is a graphic design, symbols, emblems or words, used especially for identification or as a means of giving directions or warning.</p>
      <p>According to him, the factory was sealed up following the Lagos State Government’s declaration of zero tolerance for factories and private organisations that violate safety rules and regulations.</p>
      <p>“LASG seals off Multipak factory for violation of safety rules and regulations as well as poor house-keeping and lack of signage.</p>
      <p>“The poor house-keeping led to the untimely death of Mr Femi Olatunde, a factory worker, who got his head stuck while operating one of the machines.</p>
      <p>“Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s administration is passionate about safety of lives and property of the citizenry.</p>
      <p>“On no account should any factory operates without putting in place safety equipment, quality house-keeping, signage, good wiring system and a clean environment devoid of hazards to the lives of workers and visitors, ’’ Mojola said.</p>
      <p>He, however, urged organisations and individuals to embrace best practices and international safety operations to prevent fatal incidents that endangered lives.</p>
      <p>The LSSC boss said that safety of lives and property was collective responsibility and warned that factories that violated safety rules would be severely sanctioned. (NAN)</p>
