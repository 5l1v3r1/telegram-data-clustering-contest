      <p>Some lucky fans out there got their <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477908/marvel-may-release-a-giant-infinity-saga-box-set-including-the-really-bad-scenes">Marvel's Infinity Saga Collector's Editions</a> and they're perfectly happy with them. However, slightly less lucky fans got their Infinity Saga box sets -- after paying about $550 -- and they arrived damaged. Still even less lucky fans can't even get a box set in any condition unless they pay the exorbitant prices shown on sites like eBay, 'cause Best Buy is all sold out.</p>
      <p>Happy holidays!</p>
      <p>The Infinity Saga box set includes all 23 <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/c/marvel-cinematic-universe/">Marvel Cinematic Universe movies</a> to date from the first three phases of the MCU, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480665/marvels-infinity-saga-trailer-will-give-you-chills">called the Infinity Saga</a>. When we <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481663/the-mcu-infinity-saga-box-set-looks-awesome-and-costs-everything">first got a look at the box set</a>, it was noted that it would come out November 15 and only be available through Best Buy, which even set up a payment plan.</p>
      <p>Apparently a lot of Marvel fans had enough pennies to rub together to get Infinity Saga box sets, since Best Buy ran out of product fast. If you <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-infinity-saga-collectors-edition-includes-digital-copy-4k-ultra-hd-blu-ray-blu-ray/6384410.p?skuId=6384410">go to the website</a>, you see they can't sell you a new one. However, it looks like the fan reviews here are very positive:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Some fans on Twitter are voicing their complaints due to damaged packaging. When you spend that much money, you want the box set in mint condition.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>There are several MCU fans voicing similar complaints, tagging Marvel, Best Buy, and Disney for any help on a return:</p>

        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/RillIris/status/1196101909788139522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>At least one fan said he spoke to Best Buy and the company said their hands were tied, since there is no more product to ship. So we have a supply-and-demand issue. Marvel doesn't have more Infinity Saga box sets to supply, and Best Buy apparently shipped some product in less-than-ideal conditions:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Best Buy Support did actually respond to that fan's email, <a href="https://twitter.com/BestBuySupport/status/1196838084270157825">writing this note</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Thanks for reaching out, Ryan! Although, I do wish it were under better circumstances. As a huge MCU fan myself, I'm disheartened to see the condition this box set arrived in. I would be happy to take a closer look. Please feel free to send us a DM with your full name, phone number, email address, and your order number.</blockquote>
      <p>If you head over to <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=The+Infinity+Saga+Collector%27s+Edition&amp;_sacat=0">eBay</a>, some fans are selling brand new sealed -- apparently undamaged -- Infinity Saga Collector's Editions for as much as $1,200, although more posters are starting lower in the $700-$800 range.</p>
      <p>So it's not an ideal situation, although some people out there must be happy with their perfectly good Infinity Saga box sets. And some fans are helping the rest of us out, sharing tidbits from the many extras in the collector's edition. For example, we now know <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484972/see-how-captain-marvel-was-supposed-to-appear-in-avengers-age-of-ultron-infinity-saga-box-set">how Captain Marvel was supposed to look</a> in <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i>, back when that was going to be her debut.</p>
      <p>Since Christmas is right around the corner, I wonder if Marvel will find a way to whip up something for fans who are still eager to get their hands on an official undamaged Infinity Saga Collector's Edition. For the rest of us, we can always watch the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484681/when-disney-will-get-big-movies-like-black-panther-and-star-wars-the-last-jedi">available MCU movies on Disney+</a> or Netflix or in our own less swanky home collections.</p>
