      <p>Fiona Middleton could be in for a comeback this Christmas in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a>.</p>
      <p>Hairdresser Fiona was revealed to be Emma Brooker's mother earlier this year in bombshell scenes that also saw Steve McDonald realise he is her biological father.</p>

      <p>After the death of her stepfather, Emma was devastated to learn her mum had lied to her all her life.</p>
      <p>And when she refused to return from her new life in Australia for the funeral, Emma cut her off, ending the phone call and their relationship.</p>
      <p>Next week Fiona will send her daughter tickets asking her to fly to Australia and spend Christmas with her.</p>
      <p>Touched by the gesture, Emma says yes but when she sees how disappointed Steve is she has second thoughts and tells her mum no.</p>
      <p>But with Emma staying in Weatherfield and Fiona desperate to see her daughter, a cobbles comeback could be on the cards for this Christmas.</p>
      <p>Actress Angela Griffin has already hinted that this could be the case.</p>

      <p>The 43-year-old actress, who played hairdresser Fiona Middleton from 1993 to 1998 said earlier this year how she would love to return.</p>
      <p>She told the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/">Daily Star</a>: "It's very tempting to go back and just stay there forever and a day. I'm open to the idea of that.</p>
      <p>"My character isn't dead so the door is open. There was talk about making it happen this year but it couldn't because the dates didn't work out. But it could happen in the future."</p>
      <p>The former soap star admitted the ITV show holds a special space "in her heart", and despite not appearing regularly for more than two decades she still loves being back on the cobbles.</p>
      <p>She added: "Corrie holds such a big place in my heart. I was my daughter's age when I first started on it.</p>
      <p>"But even now after all these years I still absolutely love it."</p>
