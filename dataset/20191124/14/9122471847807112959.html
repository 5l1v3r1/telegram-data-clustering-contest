      <h1>ESPN’s Adam Schefter Has Telling Update On QB Colin Kaepernick</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:45:21+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>It’s been more than a week since Colin Kaepernick worked out in front of NFL scouts, the media and hundreds of fans in Atlanta, Ga. So far, there’s been no movement in terms of a signing. It doesn’t look like that’s going to change anytime soon, either.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28149508/sources-nfl-teams-called-colin-kaepernick-qb-nov-16-workout">ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter had a telling update</a> on the NFL’s interest in Kaepernick on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>Basically, there does not appear to be any – at least not right now.</p>
      <blockquote>In the week since Colin Kaepernick worked out for seven NFL teams at Charles R. Drew High School in Riverdale, Georgia, no teams have reached out to work him out, visit with him or sign him, league sources told ESPN.</blockquote>
      <p>Kaepernick’s team reportedly sent out video of his workout to every NFL team that wasn’t in attendance for his workout. That has not led to anything.</p>
      <blockquote>Kaepernick’s representatives sent video of their client’s workout to the 25 NFL teams that did not attend last Saturday, but that has not led to any interest, either.</blockquote>
      <p>Kaepernick’s lawyer said on a podcast that two NFL teams are interested in signing his client, with some speculating that one of those teams is the Panthers. However, there’s been nothing else reported on that subject.</p>
      <p>“One who is legitimately in need of a quarterback who had a very poor showing on Sunday and has got an owner that I don’t think gives a sh-t,” <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/2-nfl-teams-reportedly-interested-colin-kaepernick">Kaepernick’s lawyer, Mark Geragos, said</a>.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick sent a strong message to NFL owners following his workout last Saturday, telling them to stop being scared. The QB says he’s been ready to play for three years and has been denied for three years. Unfortunately for him, it appears that will continue to be the case.</p>
