      <h1>Number of children under 10 years old having rotten teeth removed on the rise in Merseyside</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool and Sefton were the worst areas for tooth decay, for youngsters aged 10 or under</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:59:17+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/luke-traynor/" target="_blank">Luke Traynor</a></address>
      <p>Thousands of Merseyside children had rotten teeth removed under general anaesthetic last year - and the figure is rising.</p>
      <p>New NHS figures show 2,200 procedures in the county where a child aged 10 or under had at least one decayed tooth taken out in hospital in 2018-19.</p>
      <p>That was up from 2,070 the year before, and bucks the national trend which is one of improvement.</p>
      <p>Children who have teeth removed in hospital have the procedure done under general anaesthetic because injections to numb the pain would be too traumatic for them to manage.</p>
      <p>When they are unconscious, dentists will remove as many rotten teeth as they see necessary.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, if a tooth shows the slightest sign of decay, it will be removed in order to prevent the child having to undergo further general anaesthetic at a later stage.</p>

      <p>In most cases, tooth decay is caused by having too much sugar and not brushing teeth or cleaning gums properly.</p>
      <p>More than half of the procedures - 1,300 - happened in Liverpool, while 340 were in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/sefton">Sefton</a> , 300 in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/knowsley">Knowsley</a> , 170 in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/st-helens">St Helens</a> and 90 in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wirral">Wirral</a> .</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Public Health England said that while children’s sugar intakes have declined slightly in recent years, they are still consuming the equivalent of around eight sugar cubes more than the recommended daily limit - and often eating 11g just at breakfast.</p>
      <p>Dentists warned they were seeing cases where teeth had decayed right down to the gum.</p>
      <p>The number of procedures for children’s rotten teeth removal was, however, down from 300 the year before.</p>
      <p>Across England there were 30,965 procedures where a child had at least one rotten tooth removed.</p>

      <p>That was down from the year before, when it stood at 32,059.</p>
      <p>While an age breakdown was not available at a local level, the figures reveal that more than a third of the of the procedures across England (11,400) were for children aged five and under.</p>
      <p>Dr Nigel Carter OBE, chief executive of the Oral Health Foundation, said: “Although the figures show that these procedures are shrinking back slightly, the sad thing is that decay is totally preventable.</p>
      <p>“When you see children as young as one or two having to have their teeth removed it is incredibly distressing and it represents neglects.</p>
      <p>“Often the teeth will be decayed right down to the gum.</p>
      <p>“Two things are needed to reduce the number of these procedures further: fluoride and dietary changes.</p>

      <p>“Most importantly, teeth should be brushed twice a day with fluoride toothpaste.</p>
      <p>“Fluoride is more effective than a change in diet, though obviously eating three meals a day as opposed to regular snacking and drinking fizzy drinks will see an improvement.</p>
      <p>“The problem with children having teeth removed so young is that often the space isn’t preserved for adult teeth.</p>
      <p>“This can lead to crowding and further dental problems when adult teeth do emerge.”</p>
