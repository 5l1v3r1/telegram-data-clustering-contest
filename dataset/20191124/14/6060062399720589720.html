      <p>An American kickboxer knocked his Glory 72 opponent out so quickly the broadcaster didn't even have time to display the ring clock on screen.</p>
      <p>John King, an Oklahoma City-born light heavyweight, secured his first win under the Glory kickboxing banner after losing two in a row since signing with the fight firm.</p>
      <p>It all went down at the "Weekend of Glory" show in Chicago's Wintrust Arena in Illinois, with King needing only a brief combination of punches to send his opponent Tom Matlon to the ground.</p>
      <p>It happened so fast, Matlon only had time to really throw one kick before he was countered and put on the floor.</p>
      <p>The first King punch appears to have been thrown, and landed, around the five second mark. It was a shot so hard Matlon stumbled backwards. King then followed up with the finishing shots.</p>
      <p>Matlon face-planted the canvas, motionless, when the ring clock was finally on the screen, indicating it had all happened in the space of seven seconds.</p>
      <p>The referee then counted Matlon out. It was over. King <a href="https://twitter.com/GLORY_WS/status/1198413971390390272">broke a record for the fastest finish in Glory</a> history.</p>
