      <h1>French hooker's disgusting act on England World Cup star sees him sent off in Champions Cup clash</h1>
      <h2>There's no place for this on a rugby pitch</h2>

      <p>Sale Sharks and La Rochelle were locked in a tight European Champions Cup battle in the north west when another French moment of madness unfolded.</p>
      <p>A bit of pushing a shoving broke out as the match ticked towards half time with the scores 10-7 in favour of Sale.</p>
      <p>England World Cup star Tom Curry was in the middle of it, though nothing particularly sinister was unfolding.</p>
      <p>That was until La Rochelle hooker Pierre Bourgarit approached Curry, among a plethora of other scuffles, and grabbed his face, appearing to gouge him.</p>

      <p>The TMO intervened at that point as replays were broadcast and referee Andrew Brace felt he had no choice but to send the hooker off late in the first half.</p>
      <p>"You just can't do it. You can't put your hand anywhere near the eyes. He's gone!" Said an incredulous Austin Healey on commentary.</p>
      <p>Commentator Andrew Cotter branded it: 'Madness of a Vahaamahina level,' referring to the red card that the French lock received during the Rugby World Cup quarter-final with Wales.</p>
