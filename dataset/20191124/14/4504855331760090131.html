      <p>ST. PETERS, Mo. (AP) — An eastern Missouri man is accused of holding his pregnant girlfriend captive, punching her and forcing her to drink toilet water and bleach.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/man-held-pregnant-st-peters-woman-captive-forced-her-to/article_d3e5e61a-8807-51b8-b1c9-100c760eed5c.html">The St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a> reports that 40-year-old Ronnie William Howard of St. Peters is charged with kidnapping, domestic assault and unlawful use of a weapon. He is jailed on $300,000 cash-only bail.</p>
      <p>Police say the assault took place Wednesday at the 20-year-old victim’s apartment in St. Peters. She made a video call to a relative about the crime. The relative called the woman’s mother, who called police.</p>
      <p>The victim was treated at a hospital.</p>
      <p>A police probable cause statement says Howard has convictions in another state for kidnapping, assault by strangulation, assault with a firearm and stealing a motor vehicle. He does not have a listed attorney.</p>
