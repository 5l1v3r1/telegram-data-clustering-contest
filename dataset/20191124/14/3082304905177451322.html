        <b>Middlesbrough let a two-goal lead slip against Hull City after Marvin Johnson saw red for a careless challenge on Eric Lichaj.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hull City came from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at struggling 10-man Middlesbrough in Sunday’s early Championship clash at the Riverside Stadium.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Woodgate’s side were two goals ahead and in comfortable control after goals from Marcus Tavernier and Ashley Fletcher, but a red card for Marvin Johnson swung the match in Hull’s favour.</p>
      <p>Jarrod Bowen struck twice after the break to secure a point for the visitors, who are up to 14th in the table.</p>
      <p>Tavernier struck with just seven minutes played before Fletcher finished a fine move involving strike-partner Britt Assombalonga, only for Johnson’s reckless lunge on Eric Lichaj to leave Boro a man down before the interval.</p>
      <p>Hull were much-improved in the second half and earned a point with two Bowen goals in the space of four minutes, and they could have snatched a win had they been more clinical in the closing stages.</p>
      <p>Boro are now without a win in 10 Championship matches, but they do at least climb out of the relegation zone on goal difference.</p>
