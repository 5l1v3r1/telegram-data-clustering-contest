        <b>NAIVASHA, Kenya, Nov 24 – Muthaiga Golf Club’s Frank Matilo stormed to the top of the leaderboard thanks to his score of 2-under par-69 after the first round of action at the par-71 Great Rift Valley Lodge and Golf Resort course.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Matilo, who has blown hot and cold in the Safari Tour so far, opened his round with back-to-back par scores on the first and second, before hitting birdie on the par-3, third. A similar combination of par-par-birdie, through the next three holes, followed by par scores in the next three saw him hold a turning score of 2-under par,33.</p>
      <p>He would start the challenging back nine with a birdie on the par-4 tenth, before dropping his first shot on the par-3, twelfth. From this point he played conservatively, to hold par through the rest of the holes to return a round leading score of 2-under par, 69.</p>

      <p>Speaking after his round Matilo said, “I played well today, I am very happy with my round, the balls stayed where I hit them and the course was in great condition.”</p>
      <p>On his plans for the next round, “I will not change much in my game, I want to keep the ball in regulation, from there I will keep playing my game.”</p>
      <p>Matilo finished one shot ahead of Vet Lab’s Edwin Asuza, who shot a round of 1-under par, 70. Asuza held par through the first eight holes, before dropping his first shot at the par-4 ninth, for a front nine score of one over par, 36.</p>
      <p>He would recover brilliantly with birdies on the eleventh, thirteenth and fifteenth before bogeying the par-4 sixteenth and holding par through the remaining two holes for a one under par, 70 score.</p>

      <p>Golf Park’s David Wakhu rounded up the top three with a score of par, on what was a generally high scoring round at the plush green Great rift course. Current series leader Dismas Indiza returned a score of 2-over par, 73, with last year’s series winner Greg Snow playing a round of 5-over par, 76.</p>
      <p>The going was also tough for the home pro duo of Jastas Madoya and Andrew Chelogoi who returned scores of 9-over par and 8-over par, respectively.</p>
      <p>Royal Nairobi Golf Club’s Hesbon Kutwa, Uganda’s Brain Toolit and Shilen Nanji failed to make the first round CUT, which is set at 86.</p>
