      <h1>He's in: Bloomberg launches candidacy for president</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:58:20+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:58</time> by <a rel="author">Emily Larsen</a></address>
      <p>Michael Bloomberg has entered the already-crowded Democratic presidential field.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, 77, had earlier in November filed a statement of <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/michael-bloomberg-files-fec-paperwork-for-presidential-bid">candidacy</a> with the Federal Election Commission and filed to appear on some state Democratic primary ballots that had early deadlines, but aides said at the time that the moves were formalities while he decided on launching a full campaign.</p>
      <p>His entry to the race was proceeded by a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/michael-bloomberg-set-to-spend-more-in-one-week-on-tv-ad-blitz-than-any-candidate-ever">massive ad buy</a>, and the first of his TV ads ran on Sunday, touting his promise "to rebuild the country and restore faith in the dream that defines us: Where the wealthy will pay more in taxes and the middle class get their fair share; everyone without health insurance can get it and everyone who likes theirs, keep it; where jobs won't just help you get by but get ahead."</p>
      <p>It continues, "And on all those things, Mike Bloomberg intends to make good."</p>

      <p>He is worth an estimated $54 billion and is the eighth richest person in the world, according to a Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/#645f1b021417">estimate</a>, and is expected to almost entirely self-fund his presidential bid. Bloomberg served as New York City mayor for 12 years starting in 2002, having turned to politics after building his fortune on Wall Street and the financial services and news company named after him.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg reportedly decided to join the presidential field after seeing former Vice President Joe Biden falter in early primary state polls and in fundraising and is expected to skip the first four state nominating contests — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina — and focus on winning delegates in "Super Tuesday" states holding contests on March 3 and beyond. Several Democratic presidential candidates have <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/attempt-to-buy-the-presidency-2020-democrats-slam-looming-bloomberg-bid">accused</a> Bloomberg of hoping to buy the presidency.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.mikebloomberg.com/">released a statement</a> through his website that said, in part, "We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions."</p>
      <p>He has been a registered Republican, Democrat, and independent throughout his political career. In anticipation of his presidential bid, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-was-wrong-bloomberg-apologizes-for-stop-and-frisk">apologized</a> Nov. 17 during a speech at a black church in Brooklyn for implementing and defending "stop-and-frisk" policing policy, which critics argue unfairly targeted minority communities.,</p>
