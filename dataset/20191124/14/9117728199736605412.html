        <b>Stoffel Vandoorne used to race for <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> in Formula 1 but is having more fun racing in Formula E for the new Mercedes team. The Belgian racer did not enjoy his time in Formula 1 and has revealed why this was. </b>

      <p><i>"It is a bit of a fake world in which everyone gets along well, but above all has their own interests to defend,"</i> Vandoorne told <i><a href="https://sportmagazine.knack.be/sport/motorsporten/vandoorne-derde-in-eerste-eprix-van-het-seizoen/article-news-1535273.html">Voetbalmagazine.</a></i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"In Formula E, Le Mans or the WEC endurance races you will find pure racing right now. You come here to race, not to do politics.</i>

        <i>"Formula 1 remains the largest championship, Formula E is just below that. </i>
        <i>It is one of the most competitive championships I have competed in. Many drivers have experience in Formula 1, others have a track record with which they could enter F1.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"It's the future. That's why you see more and more car manufacturers use electric."</i>

      <p>Formula E is continuing to grow and many enjoy it because it is seemingly just pure racing and less political than Formula 1. Fans are fortunate as they are able to enjoy both series! </p>
