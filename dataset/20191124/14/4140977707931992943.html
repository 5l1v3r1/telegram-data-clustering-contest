                <h3>Raheem Sterling posts a hilarious tweet after VAR rules out his goal vs Chelsea</h3>
                <p>With the match nearing its end, Chelsea hunted for the equaliser. However, it was Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling who beat the keeper to complete the rout. Unfortunately for the forward, the goal was ruled out by VAR by the most marginal of offsides. This was not the first time this has happened to the City Star; And he made sure everyone knew about it.</p>

                      <p>Fortunately for Sterling and City, this time, VAR had no bearing on the match. City still went on to win the match. However, they had to dig deep for the victory; as is evidenced by the fact that they could only muster 46% of the possession.</p>

                          <p>Regardless, a victory is a victory. Both sides will leave happy knowing they gave a good account of themselves and will want to build on it. Raheem Sterling on the other hand, will rue all the goals that VAR has stripped of him. However, should City end up toppling Liverpool by the end of the season, it is unlikely that he will mind too much.</p>
