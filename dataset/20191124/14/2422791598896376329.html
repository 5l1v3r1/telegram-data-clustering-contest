      <p>ATLANTA -- Rappers Iggy Azalea and Playboi Carti have told Atlanta police that US$366,000 worth of jewelry was stolen from their rental home.</p>

      <p>Amethyst Kelly, who performs as Iggy Azalea, told police the theft occurred Nov. 14, when the back door was unlocked so Jordan Carter, known as Playboi Carti, could get in.</p>
      <p>The report says that at some point, they realized a designer bag in which they keep jewelry was missing from the second-floor dining room of their 6,500-square-foot (600-square-metre) home.</p>
      <p>It says surveillance video shows a gunman wearing gloves and a mask coming in the back door just after 9:50 p.m. and leaving within 10 minutes.</p>
