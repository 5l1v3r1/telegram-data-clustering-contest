        <b>Fury Road secured an effortless success in the "Monksfield" Novice Hurdle at Navan.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Grade Three event lost much of its sheen when the winner's fellow Gordon Elliott inmate, Abacadabras, was withdrawn on Sunday morning - leaving Fury Road to be sent off the 1-25 favourite.</p>
      <p>Fury Road was an 18-length winner on his initial start over hurdles at Down Royal at the start of the month, and jockey Davy Russell was full of confidence from the off.</p>
      <p>He was well in control with four flights to jump - and Fury Road cantered home 10 lengths clear, firmly on the bridle.</p>
      <p>Elliott may consider a step up in trip for the Gigginstown House Stud-owned winner, although the Grade One Lawlor's of Naas Novice Hurdle over two and a half miles on January 5 is another option.</p>
      <p>He said: "It was straightforward, as it should have been, but he's a nice horse and is better than that form. He could step right out to three miles if we wanted, and he jumps very well. He could go for the three-mile race at Limerick or the Lawlor's race at Naas. He's a big, staying horse."</p>
