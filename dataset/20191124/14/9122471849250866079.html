      <p>Rivalry Week has arrived. It should be a good one.</p>
      <p>The biggest week of the college football regular season is always highlighted by Ohio State-Michigan. The Buckeyes and the Wolverines are set to meet in Ann Arbor on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Jim Harbaugh has yet to defeat his rival, and Ohio State will be the favorite in this year’s matchup once again, but Michigan is coming on strong.</p>
      <p>The Wolverines topped Indiana on Saturday in blowout fashion. They’re riding a solid winning streak into The Game this year.</p>
      <p>Michigan fans appear to have some optimism, too.</p>
      <p>A “Beat Ohio” chant was started late in the Wolverines’ win over Indiana. Michigan’s fan base appears to be ready to go.</p>

      <p>Michigan’s players enjoyed hearing that.</p>
      <p>“That’s something that’s really cool to listen to and watch,” <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/college/university-michigan/2019/11/23/michigan-quickly-turns-attention-ohio-state-were-ready-next-week/4288194002/">left tackle Jon Runyan said</a>. “We were still kind of on the field when that was going on. I’m proud of my teammates. Wins in college football are hard to come by. I’m going to enjoy this one until midnight then we’ll get on to next week.</p>
      <p>“We know what we’ve got ahead of us and looking forward to getting back to work.”</p>
      <p>Michigan and Ohio State are set to meet at 12 p.m. E.T. on Saturday.</p>
