      <p><b>NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS (-6½) over Dallas Cowboys:</b> Having taken out the Redskins, Giants and Eagles by steadily decreasing margins, Bill Belichick seeks to complete an NFC East sweep, Catching the Cowboys away from AT&amp;T solidifies advantage. Belichick’s ability to maximize each week’s opportunities matters. The Cowboys find ways to underperform, and have done so ever since Jimmy Johnson left the premises. As Tom Brady and the accompanying Patriots skill people find themselves working finer edges, their advantage may diminish — but it still exists, and under fourth-quarter endgame pressures, we side with the A Team against all other league coaching staffs. Patriots work it, for one unit.</p>
      <p><b>CINCINNATI BENGALS (+6½) over Pittsburgh Steelers:</b> Pittsburgh has seen its postseason prospects shrink appreciably, and despite the Steelers’ recent dominance over Cincy, this is not the ideal spot for them to get well now, given the Bengals’ desperation in quest of their initial seasonal win. Steelers shouldn’t be favored to this extent. Bengals, for one unit.</p>
      <p><b>Last week:</b> 1-1. Rams/Bears Under (W). Texans (L).<br/><b>Season:</b> 14-7-1.</p>
