        <li>Bigger isn’t necessarily better, especially when it comes to fast-food burgers.</li>
        <li>Sometimes, a higher price tag means a better burger. Sometimes, it just means a bigger burger.</li>
        <li>I tried the most expensive burgers at <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/mcdonalds">McDonald’s</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/wendys">Wendy’s</a>, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/burger-king">Burger King</a> to see whose burger was most worth the elevated price. McDonald’s double quarter pounder with cheese and bacon was the only burger with ingredients and a taste that justified its high cost.</li>

      <p>Bigger doesn’t always mean better, and that’s especially true when it comes to burgers.</p>
      <p>Sure, burger size may matter when it’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-burger-king-wendys-cheapest-and-most-expensive-burgers-compared-2019-10">the difference</a> between a filling meal and an unsatisfying one, but there definitely is such a thing as “too big” when it comes to America’s favorite meal-in-a-bun.</p>
      <p>So when it comes to the most expensive burgers fast food has to offer, which ones are better, and which ones are just bigger?</p>
      <p>I tried the most expensive burgers at McDonald’s, Burger King, and Wendy’s to see whose bougie burger best justified its elevated price tag. Here’s how they compared:</p>
