      <h1>The M&amp;S cheese advent calendar is unveiled - with a cheddar Santa for Christmas Day</h1>
      <h2>Get out the crackers the cheese advent calendar is here</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:10:52+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:10</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, Paul Greaves</a></address>
      <p>Just when you thought your chocolate advent calendar had everything you needed to mark the Christmas countdown along comes a festive alternative - complete with a cheese Santa.</p>
      <p>Marks &amp; Spencer has released a fromage-based Christmas calendar which includes 24 individually wrapped bite-sized chedders.</p>
      <p>When you have munched through the month you can open the final door to a special Santa-shaped cheese for the big day, says the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/shopping-deals/ms-unveil-cheese-advent-calendar-20943172?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=mirror_main">Mirror</a>.</p>
      <p>It's out now, available in selected stores only. You will, however, need to make room to store the advent calendar in your fridge to ensure your daily treats stay fresh.</p>
      <p>The supermarket announced the release on social media, setting tongues wagging with its fans as the post got almost 5,000 comments on  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> .</p>
      <p>One said: "This is not just any cheese advent calendar, it's an M&amp;S cheese advent calendar."</p>
      <p>Another tagged their friend to say: "If we don't have these and have a phone call every night to review each one then our friendship's just run its course."</p>

      <p>A third came up with the genius idea of pairing it with another calendar, commenting: "The ideal accompaniment for the gin calendar!"</p>
      <p>If cheese isn't really your thing, the supermarket has also  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/shopping-deals/ms-selling-percy-pig-advent-20559263">released a Percy Pig advent calendar</a>  , which is also on sale in stores now and costs £5.</p>
      <p>The treats have been transformed in the build up to December 25 with 24 milk chocolate oinkers to scoff down throughout the month.</p>

      <p>But fear not, the real reason we're all here is saved until the big, where a regular bag of Percy Pigs hides behind the final delicious door.</p>
      <p>And if you really want to complete the set, Colin the Caterpillar has undergone a festive make-over to turn himself into a must-have Christmas cake.</p>
      <p>Despite his yuletide transformation complete with Santa hat, Colin remains the same on the inside with the usual winning recipe, retailing for £10.</p>
