      <p>The Magee brothers inspired <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Banbridge">Banbridge</a> to just their second win of the men’s EY Hockey League season as they added to Pembroke’s woes with a 4-2 success in Serpentine Avenue.</p>
      <p>Preseason both sides were considered playoff contenders, but found themselves in the bottom three after five founds.</p>
      <p>For Bann they are attempting to transition to a new regime under Gordon Cracknell after nine years with coach Mark Tumilty, but showed some signs of things coming together.</p>
      <p>Against the Ballsbridge side they got off to a flyer, with Jonny McKee cashing in from Drew Carlisle’s incisive pass for 1-0 and Eugene Magee’s powerful drag-flick had them two up inside five minutes.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Greg+Chambers">Greg Chambers</a> got one back for Pembroke before half-time but Eugene harked back to his days as a Down minor hurler with a sublime strike.</p>
      <p>His younger brother Owen nabbed their fourth before Chambers got a late consolation. In a congested mid-table it was enough to lift Bann up four places to fifth.</p>
      <p>The Dubliners drop to ninth as a result as their struggles from last term have carried over into this campaign with just two wins from 11 league games since February.</p>
      <p>Lisnagarvey continue to set a ferocious pace, running up a sixth successive win with a 6-2 result over Corinthian, bringing their tally to 35 goals in the premier competition.</p>
      <p>Monkstown withstood YMCA’s final-quarter comeback to prevail 3-2 at Wesley. David Cole, Gareth Watkins and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Davy+Carson">Davy Carson</a> had them seemingly on course for a handy win at half time, but penalty corner goals from Sam Hyland and Matthew Walker saw the Y reduce the gap significantly.</p>
      <p>Three Rock Rovers’ erratic season continued as they recovered from last week’s 6-0 mauling to Town to beat and leap-frog Glenanne with plenty to spare. They led 4-0 after 14 minutes, with James Walker netting twice before completing the win in the closing phases from a counter-attack.</p>
      <p>UCD and Annadale’s contest at Belfield was called off last Thursday due to a bout of mumps at the university.</p>
