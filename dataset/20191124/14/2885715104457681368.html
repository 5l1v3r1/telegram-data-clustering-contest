      <p>Pioneering marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge and US hurdler Dalilah Muhammad were named the World Athletes of the Year in track and field on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Kipchoge became the first man to run a sub-two-hour marathon, though the feat wasn’t officially recognized as a world record. That’s because he ran on his own, with a rotating group of pacemakers and in strictly controlled conditions. Kipchoge’s only competitive race this year came when he won the London Marathon in April.</p>

      <p>“I am happy to be the first human being to run under two hours. I hope that I inspired a lot of generations,” Kipchoge told the awards ceremony via video link.</p>
      <p>Muhammad won world championship 400-meter hurdles in world record time. She earlier broke the record in July at the US championships. “It’s been an amazing year. I’m so thankful to be here,” she said.</p>
