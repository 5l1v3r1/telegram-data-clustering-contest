      <p>UNION CITY, Calif. (AP) — Two boys were fatally shot while sitting in a van outside an elementary school early Saturday morning, police said.</p>
      <p>The shootings of the boys, ages 11 and 14, took place in the parking lot of Searles Elementary School, the East Bay Times <a href="https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/11/23/two-killed-in-union-city-shooting-police-investigating/">reported.</a></p>
      <p>Callers to 911 reported hearing gunfire at 1:26 a.m., the newspaper said. Authorities said that when officers arrived, they found the boys.</p>
      <p>The older boy died at the scene, and the younger child died en route to a trauma center, the Times reported.</p>
      <p>New Haven Unified School District Superintendent John Thompson said in a statement that the victims were minors.</p>
      <p>The boys attended schools in the district, Thompson and a district spokesman said.</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made in connection with the killings.</p>
      <p>Police Lt. Steve Mendez said there was no sign of a connection between the shooting and the school where it took place. People occasionally gather in the relatively secluded parking lot, Mendez told the Times.</p>
      <p>Thompson said the school district “will have support for our students and staff at the sites where these students attended when school resumes after the Thanksgiving break.”</p>
      <p>The district also will work with the Union City Police Department “to ensure that our schools are as safe as they can be,” he said.</p>
      <p>Police are investigating the possibility that an earlier shooting may be related to the slayings, the Times reported. About 12:30 a.m. on Nov. 20, two men were shot and wounded near an intersection in Union City.</p>
      <p>The men were treated at a local hospital and released. Police told the newspaper that no evidence so far has linked the two incidents.</p>
