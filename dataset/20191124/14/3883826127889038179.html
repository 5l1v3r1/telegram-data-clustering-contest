        <b>A man has died after being found fatally stabbed in a car outside a railway station in west London.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Murder detectives believe the 26-year-old victim was injured in a fight near to West Ealing railway station and was then involved in a car crash on Drayton Green Road shortly before 01:20 GMT.</p>
      <p>Police have also quashed rumours the man was killed in a "road rage" attack.</p>
      <p>So far there have been no arrests as detectives continue to investigate the man's murder.</p>
      <p>The victim's family is aware and a post-mortem examination will be held later.</p>
      <p>Det Insp Neil John said: "We believe the victim was involved in an altercation 100m from the railway station on The Avenue.</p>
      <p>"This is a busy street with a number of shops and restaurants and if anybody was in the area and saw something, no matter how small, I would urge them to contact police."</p>

      <p>Ruth Holmstock, 72, whose flat overlooks the scene of the crash, said she heard a single "thump" in the early hours.</p>
      <p>She described it as "the sort of noise you make when you reverse into a gate, but it was loud enough to make me go and see what it was."</p>
      <p>"There were a lot of people hanging around. It looked like any other crash, like they were swapping insurance details," she added.</p>
      <p>Kiran Ramachandraiah, who lives in the same block of flats, said he woke up at about 02:00 to see paramedics trying to revive the victim.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't see the person," he said. "He was completely surrounded by police and paramedics."</p>
      <p>The attack follows <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-50529469">a fatal stabbing in Whitechapel on Saturday</a>, in which another man in his 20s was killed.</p>
      <p>Six men were arrested on the suspicion of murdering a 27-year-old at a flat party in Buckle Street.</p>
