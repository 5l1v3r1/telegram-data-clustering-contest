      <p>Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar has had to face the wrath of cricket fans on social media for publicly insulting renowned cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle. The incident took place during the just-concluded India-Bangladesh pink-ball Test match, which the hosts went on to win by an innings and 46 runs.</p>

      <p>An audio of Bhogle and Manjrekar fiercely disagreeing with each other on whether cricket administrators ought to consult the members of the national team before rolling out the pink ball in Test cricket has gone viral. The audio in question triggered a wave of criticism aimed at Manjrekar, who many believed had crossed limits by insulting a well-respected cricket commentator.</p>
      <p>In the viral audio, Bhogle is heard saying, “I would generally ask batsmen on both sides (on what they think of the pink ball).” Manjrekar interrupts asking, “Do you think Virat Kohli wasn’t seeing the (pink) ball properly?”</p>
      <p>Bhogle explained, “Or Ajinkya Rahane or Cheteshwar Pujara and all of them. Just ask them, ‘what do you think?’ If the pink ball cricket is going to be a regular feature, then you just want to make sure..” Manjrekar once again interrupts.</p>
      <p>Bhogle repeats his point, “Yes, it doesn’t cost anything to ask.” Manjrekar replied rudely, “You need to ask Harsha. For us, who’ve played the game..we get the fair idea.”</p>
      <p>Far from being rattled by Manjrekar’s insult, Bhogle explained that the former needed to remember that there was no age limitation to learn new things.</p>
      <p>Fans did not like Manjrekar insulting a renowned broadcaster and expert on cricket.</p>

      <p>Manjrekar had courted controversy during this year’s World Cup for <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/sports/twitter-war-escalates-as-michael-vaughan-informs-breaking-news-i-have-been-blocked-by-sanjay-manjrekar/257209/">questioning the credentials of Ravindra Jadeja</a> by calling him a ‘bits and pieces’ player.’ He had later blocked former England captain Michael Vaughan after he mocked his comment in light of Jadeja’s impressive performance both as a bowler and batsman.</p>
      <p>In June, during the World Cup cricket, former India captain Sourav Ganguly (now BCCI President), had called an unnamed ex-cricketer an <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/huge-twitter-war-between-sourav-ganguly-and-sanjay-manjrekar/251632/">‘attention-seeker’</a> prompting many to conclude that he was targeting Manjrekar.</p>
