      <p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Friday announced the three co-chairs for her presidential campaign: progressive Congresswomen Deb Haaland (D-NM), Katie Porter (D-CA) and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA).</p>

      <p>Haaland, a Native American, has received flack for supporting Warren. The reason? People feel Haaland betrayed her people. After all, the senator claimed she was Native American. It was later revealed through DNA testing that she is only 1/1024th Native American.</p>

      <p>Freshman Congresswoman Katie Porter was going back and forth between endorsing Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) but eventually went with Warren. When she announced her decision to back the Massachusetts senator, she shared a picture of her with Warren when she graduated from Harvard Law.</p>

      <p>When Rep. Ayanna Pressley announced she was endorsing Warren, she was the first member of "the Squad" to do so. Congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN) endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The only member of "the Squad" who has yet to make an endorsement is Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).</p>
      <p>Rumors have swirled, saying "the Squad" is fighting over who deserves to be president. Tlaib, however, said that's the furthest thing from the truth.</p>
