      <p>Nov. 24 (UPI) -- A small aircraft crashed into houses in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, killing 19 aboard and at least five people on the ground Sunday morning, officials said.</p>
      <p>The Dornier-228 twin-turboprop aircraft, operated by private airline Busy Bee, crashed into houses in the Mapendo district in Goma shortly after takeoff from the airport, provincial governor Nzanzu Kasivita Carly said in a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/24/africa/drc-plane-crash-intl/index.html">statement obtained by CNN</a>.</p>
      <p>Kasivita said the crash had "cost the lives of our fellow countrymen."</p>
      <p>Aboard the plane were 17 passengers and two crew members. An unknown number of residents were in the homes. The <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-50536220?intlink_from_url=&amp;link_location=live-reporting-story?ilink=1">BBC reported</a> the dead included four members of one family.</p>
      <p>The plane, which was scheduled to fly to Beni, about 220 miles north of Goma, experienced engine failure right after take-off.</p>
      <p>According to witnesses, the pilot was attempting to return the plane to the airport after hearing a loud sound that seemed to come from the engine, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/plane-carrying-19-people-crashes-takeoff-dr-congo-goma-191124090452382.html">Al Jazeera reported</a>.</p>
      <p>No commercial carriers in the African nation are allowed to fly into European Union airspace because of lax safety standards and poor maintenance.</p>
      <p>The Dornier Do 228 was manufactured from 1981 until 1998.</p>
