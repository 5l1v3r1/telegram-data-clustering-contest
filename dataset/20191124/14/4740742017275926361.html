      <h2>Every word from the head coach following stalemate against Nottingham Forest</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:18:42+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:18</time> by <a rel="author">Gregor MacGregor</a></address>
      <h3>An opportunity lost would you say?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, I do think they're a very good side. First half, you could see the game plan of theirs was to sit in and frustrate and we had to take the ball.</p>
      <p>I thought we got into some good areas, first half and second half. And then didn't test the goalkeeper anywhere enough. Second half, we started bright and tweaked a few things tactically at half-time and it worked.</p>
      <p>Our build-up play was good, again coming over into that final third we must have had 40-50 entries in the second half, and at that point it was then disappointing. Whether that was the actual end delivery or the referee allowing on five occasions giving a foul, and at half-time we've mentioned the referee likes giving the fouls and he's very inconsistent and of course that lets them off the hook with a dead ball situation.</p>
      <p>I thought the subs were good when they came on and they affected the game. Niclas looked bright and sharp and put six or seven decent crosses put in but we just couldn't get on the end of. Then there's two fantastic opportunities really, Rowe's one at the far post and Rodri's three yards out to make a good connection and score.</p>

      <p>If one of those two go in we're all feeling a lot different, in terms of how the performance was. Individually, the boys played well, tactically they were good.</p>
      <p>And there's not too many negatives apart from that little bit of quality and unfortuanetly that's a little bit where we are at the moment. We're still a new group 17 games in and performing well against a very good and established Championship side.</p>
      <h3>Did you have a good view of the sending off?</h3>
      <p>I didn't, no, I didn't see it. I look back on the clips and they [the analysts] said it was a bad one though. The analysts said it was an old-fashioned two-footer.</p>
      <h3>Defensively, not too many chances given up. Maybe that one for Grabban at the end there...</h3>
      <p>It's a foul. And that's what I'm saying: it's the inconsistency of the referees. Baker gets pole-axed from behind, so he can't clear it properly because he gets a forearm in the back of the net. And all of a sudden they get a chance.</p>
      <p>Again, you've got to look at the referees. It's horrible [referees dropping down from the Premier League]. There's a particular word that I want to use but I won't because it'll end up costing me.</p>
      <p>Who's the show about?</p>
      <h3>End product is the area to improve then...</h3>
      <p>It's definitely the end product. The areas we got into the way we slickly moved from box to box, particularly when they had 10 men, was good. I don't think people realise how good they are. We do in the analysis we do. Yes, we're at home but we were constantly trying to break them down. We didn't always execute.</p>
      <p>Baker's different to Adam Webster - Baker's an out and out defender but Webster would drive through gaps and step into midfield. So when they sit off you nobody really likes seeing the three centre-halfs having the ball.</p>
      <p>But I thought Baker was excellent in his decision-making and the way he played.</p>
      <p>Honestly, individually I cannot grumble with 95 per cent of each of the player's performances, it was just that end bit of quality that we saw like last week, how it changes Championship games. And such is life.</p>
      <h3>You had one or two players missing today. Any new <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> injuries?</h3>
      <p>Taylor Moore has had a scan on his knee - hopefully it’s not too bad. It could just be bone bruising.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>But he has got to get it assessed. He's getting swelling on the knee and when you get that at 22 I don't want to risk it. He's got a bright future ahead of him and has done well.</p>
      <p>He’s due to discuss the scan result on Monday to discuss any exploratory work to be done with the physios but he did train yesterday, but the fluid has stuck in there. It's not worth it as it's not a cup final.</p>
      <h3>And Kalas?</h3>
      <p>Kalas has got a longstanding tendonitis  issue - another byproduct of international training regimes.</p>
      <p>I think Kalas has got to be stronger - he played on the Sunday and trained fully on the Monday.</p>
      <p>They didn’t have a gym [with the Czech Republic team] and with tendernitis issue on the knee, you need to load the knee - he's got a regular loading programme back at home and with us.</p>
      <p>Again, it’s disappointing. It's lesson learned for Kalas himself - because he doesn't want to be missing games, particularly when you've got players like Bailey Wright and Taylor Moore in those positions.</p>
      <h3>Are you saying that he should have challenged the international manager?</h3>
      <p>He shouldn’t have trained, there's no doubt. At matchday plus one, it should have been a recovery day.</p>
      <p>He decided to or they didn't care enough to let him not train because our game was on the Sunday - most people who played there played on the Saturday.</p>
      <h3>Can you complain about that?</h3>
      <p>Listen, it's up to my sports science team to communicate with them on a regular basis. It's not up to me to speak to the doctors and sports science team.</p>
      <p>But the player has a level of responsibility too. Sometimes Tomas thinks he's Superman but he's got to think smart really to extend his career to keep playing at 37-38.</p>
      <h3>You see Forest as strong challengers?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, I think they're strong. There's big money been spent. They've got a lot of players and they're very organised. They're a good side.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>What did you make of Bailey Wright's return?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, good: he was nice and solid. He was aggressive and his communication was good. He was simple but effective on the ball and defended extremely well. Obviously Ameobi's a difficult player to play and unorthodox in his style and he comes quite narrow and Bailey Wright had to stand up to the challenge physically and technically.</p>
      <p>Sometimes Bailey Wright gets some unfair criticism from the support base - but let me tell you, he's one of the best professionals I've worked with and the best captain I've worked with and it's certainly good to see him in mind and body extremely fit.</p>
      <h3>So he's not going anywhere in January? Some <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> fans have seen that he's not playing and put two and two together.</h3>
      <p>It's Bailey's task to get in the team, to keep his body right for a sustained period and then keep the shirt. He's captain of the football club, so he's got every chance of doing that but we've got to get results and get wins and that's what becomes important.</p>
      <p>And if we need to open it up and attack in a different way from different angles then sometimes it's better to have a different attribute in those types of positions.</p>

      <h3>You brought Fam back in straightaway, but the ball didn't fall for him.</h3>
      <p>I thought he was excellent in his hold-up play. First half, very, very good. We're definitely getting stronger with the likes of Bailey getting stronger physically and mentally, and the likes of Korey Smith and Jay not too far away and Kalas, it isn't a bad one so he would have played if it was a cup final and hopefully Taylor Moore isn't too bad.</p>
      <p>We're not going to be able to do a lot about the Benik situation of course but there's a lot of positives. It's another good point. There will be a lot of people who struggle to get a point from them. Yes, we wanted to win the game and that was clear from the substitutions and the boys' attitude but we just let them off the hook too many times.</p>
      <h3>On Fam, he had that situation where he scored a hat-trick for Senegal last week, after a pastor entered the pitch and prayed in the goal mouth to where he scored. Did he mention that?</h3>
      <p>I don't know - I didn't speak to him about it. I did see a glimpse of something online but he hasn't mentioned it.</p>
      <p>Fam doesn't get in front of of his man enough, does he?</p>
      <p>He would argue and we would that the goal he scored where he got across his man a couple of home games ago was what we want as much as possible. Getting across the near post that we've really tried to introduce this year and that focus, it doesn't matter who it is. And Famara is good at getting across people.</p>
      <p>I thought the boys were brilliant today considering most of them arrived back Thursday afternoon. You get one proper day working with them and then all of a sudden you throw them into a difficult Championship game. And nobody looked like they were suffering with fatigue, concentration or team cohesion.</p>
      <p>It's a good thing that we've got so many internationals but a difficult thing because you lose them for 13-14 day period.</p>
