      <p>The NFL weather forecast for Week 12 could mostly be summed up in one word: "manageable". It's not perfect, asthere's some wind, some rain, and some cold weather games, but no one game is particularly troublesome -- at least not enough to have a huge effect on your fantasy start 'em, sit 'em decisions.</p>

      <h3>NFL Week 12 weather updates</h3>
      <p><b>Broncos @ Bills.</b>It should be cool and breezy in Orchard Park with temperatures around 40 degrees and a sustained wind of 15 mph (with stronger gusts around 25 mph). Based on over 100 similar weather games across the NFL, passing yards have dipped seven percent and total scoring has dropped nine percent in conditions like this(stats courtesyof RotoGrinders'<a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frotogrinders.com%2Fmarketplace%2Fnfl-weather-edge-642&amp;data=02%7C01%7CMatt.Lutovsky%40dazn.com%7C9adc38b2d9e14598fec908d76f737da7%7C30459df51e534d8ba1620ad2348546f1%7C1%7C0%7C637100414126856978&amp;sdata=5gi1qdySNz%2FM2Z73BPfAdYHjzwePF1DQNu1c%2FCKyJaU%3D&amp;reserved=0">NFL WeatherEdge</a>). That's probably not enough to pull players from this game, but I wouldn't expect them to be at 100-percentefficiency.</p>

      <p><b>Raiders @ Jets.</b>Decent chance of some rain during the game. The best hope is that the rain will be clear by kickoff, but I expect some lingering showers are likely. Thankfully, we aren't looking at the kind of heavy rain that can really impact offenses --just a slight negative impact here.</p>
      <p><b>Cowboys @ Patriots.</b>Here's another game with a chance for rain, but the late-afternoon kickoff time here likely saves us from the worst of it. There's a chance for some early showers -- perhaps even heavy, so we'll have to see what the forecasts show on Sunday morning.<b>UPDATE: </b>The latest hi-res models indicate most of the heavy rain will clear before game time, but this one will still be wet.</p>
      <p><b>UPDATE: Lions @ Redskins. </b>This game has a relatively low chance of showers with 10-15-mph wind.</p>
      <p><b>UPDATE: Seahawks @ Eagles. </b>There's a chance for some rain, but most of the showers should clear by kickoff.</p>
