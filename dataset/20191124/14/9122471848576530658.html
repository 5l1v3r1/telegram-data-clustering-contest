      <h1>Oklahoma Fans Will Love What Lincoln Riley Said After Win vs. TCU</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:09:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Oklahoma barely escaped TCU on Saturday night to remain in the thick of the College Football Playoff hunt. The Sooners got some help, too.</p>
      <p>Oregon suffered a surprising upset loss on Saturday night, losing at Arizona State. The Ducks are now eliminated from the College Football Playoff race.</p>
      <p>This helps Oklahoma, which is ranked below the Pac-12’s two contenders in Utah and Oregon (though not for long).</p>
      <p>Lincoln Riley isn’t worrying about any of that right now, though.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma’s head coach is strictly focused on his rival.</p>
      <p>“Getting ready for Oklahoma State,” Riley said when asked about Oregon’s loss.</p>

      <p>All Riley and Oklahoma can control is the opponent in front of them. So, that’s all the Sooners should be focusing on right now.</p>
      <p>If Oklahoma can win out and finish at 12-1, the rest should take care of itself.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma and Oklahoma State are set to play at 8 p.m. E.T. on Saturday. The game will be on FOX.</p>
