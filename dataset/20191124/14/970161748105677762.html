        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> are considering a January move for Roma and Italy midfielder Nicolo Zaniolo, but will face stiff competition from Paris Saint-Germain if they decide to make a move.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 20-year-old has fast become one of the most sought-after talents in Europe after becoming a fixture in the Roma team and bursting onto the international scene as well.</p>
      <p>The youngster made his Italy debut in March and scored his first two goals for his country in the 9-1 battering of Armenia last week.</p>
      <p>Previously linked with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a>, Zaniolo has regularly been talked up as a target for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> clubs in recent months, with Manchester United now leading the chasing pack.</p>
      <p>However, the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1208528/Man-Utd-60m-transfer-PSG">Express</a> report that PSG are also keen on the Italian, which means that he will become very expensive, very quickly.</p>
      <p>If United or PSG are going to prise the midfielder away from the Italian capital, they will have to come up with at least £50m.</p>

      <p>The club are under no pressure to sell as he only signed a new deal at Roma, keeping him there until 2024, however, they could still be tempted to sell with a big offer on the table.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils may have an advantage over PSG in discussions, though, as they plan to involve Zaniolo in a deal to make Chris Smalling’s loan to Roma permanent.</p>

      <p>The England international is currently on a short-term deal with Roma but has impressed and the club are thought to be interested in extending his stay.</p>
      <p>Zaniolo has been made aware of the interest from England, but has only spoken of his desire to continue his career at Roma.</p>
      <p>‘Interest from England? It would be easy to say ‘Yes, why not’, but it wouldn’t be me,’ said the Italy international.</p>
      <p>‘I tell you the truth, I recently kissed the Roma shirt and I want to kiss it anytime I score a goal.</p>
      <p>‘I’m very happy, Roma have given me so much confidence, now I’ll repay it on the pitch. I’m proud to represent these fans, I feel very good here.’</p>
