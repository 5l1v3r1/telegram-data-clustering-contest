      <h1>The 1950s in Bristol: Before the wrecking ball came to make Broadmead</h1>
      <h2>Bristol Times has uncovered archive photos taken near and around what is now Broadmead in the 1950s</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T14:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Eugene Byrne</a></address>
      <p>It’s a local cliché that “the planners” did as much, if not more, damage to Bristol’s built heritage as the Luftwaffe did, but for those of us not old enough to have witnessed it, these pictures are shocking.</p>
      <p>Most are boring, a dull record of flat-capped workmen earning an honest day’s pay carrying out destruction in the name of progress.</p>
      <p>Whole streets disappeared under what became the Broadmead shopping centre, or which were once where Castle Park and Cabot Circus are now – Ellbroad Street, Tower Lane, Castle Mill Street, Narrow Weir, Milk Street (oh, OK, there’s a sort of “Milk Street” in Cabot Circus). All these and more are long gone, most during the 1950s. Others are still there, but changed beyond all recognition to any time-traveller dropping in from 1950.</p>

      <p>Many of the photos show how derelict and tired some of these streets were after the war, while many also show us some quite attractive buildings, from the 19th century and older – houses, schools, pubs, churches – which would soon fall to the wrecking ball.</p>

          <figcaption>This spot is nowadays on the edge of Castle Park, facing the entrance to the Galleries car park. The building, or the lower half of it anyway, is occupied by Salanson &amp; Co, a photographic shop and optician. The premises were previously occupied by photographer Fred Little. Before that, this impressive building was St Peter’s School, though we don’t know when it closed. By 1937 it was also the parish hall for the nearby St Peter’s Church, which of course was lost in the Blitz.<cite>(Image: Bristol Post)</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>Penn Street being laid out, 1957. The gaps in the buildings are due to enemy action, and demolition men would do the rest. The Whitefield Tabernacle, dating back to 1753, would not survive for long after its 200th birthday. The same view nowadays would be of the northern side of Penn Street, looking at a big Cabot Circus fashion shop.<cite>(Image: Bristol Post)</cite></figcaption>

      <p>Communities which had been in the heart of Bristol disappeared, most of the residents rehoused in council flats and houses around the edge of the city. None would deny their new homes were better, but many would grow wistful about the streets and pubs where everyone knew everyone else’s business, where they looked after one another.</p>
      <p>Was it a crime? No. Any regrets people had over the loss of community did not extend to nostalgia for rats, damp and outside toilets.</p>
      <p>Bristol needed a shopping centre, and that meant attracting the big-name stores. Marks &amp; Spencer, Woolworths, C&amp;A, Dolcis, Swears &amp; Wells and others wanted big, modern shops, not 17th century buildings with creaky floorboards.</p>
      <p>To most Bristolians in the 1950s, demolishing the old to make way for clean, modern new buildings seemed perfectly sensible.</p>
      <p>Was it a shame? Undoubtedly. Had it been possible to put the big stores somewhere else (but where?) and had that warren of pre-war streets been restored, accompanied by stringent planning rules to preserve the heritage, the area would now be a major tourist draw.</p>
      <p>Bristol would be selling itself as bigger, better and quainter than York. The area would be all boutique hotels, rustic gastro-pubs and shops selling expensive chocolates and designer gear. The chapels and meeting houses where people once learned to fear God and love their neighbour would be the offices of chartered accountants and business consultants.</p>
      <p>Does any of this have any relevance today? Perhaps. With an increasingly acrimonious debate now going on about tall buildings or the redevelopment of something called the “Western Harbour” the question is not simply one of what we knock down – it’s about the things we allow to be built, too.</p>
