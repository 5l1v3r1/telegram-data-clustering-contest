      <p>It’s been four years since <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/faith-no-more/">Faith No More</a> released their critically-acclaimed comeback album Sol Invictus, and a little over two since Mike Patton said that the band were on an “extended break.” But that hiatus might be over, as Faith No More have posted a cryptic image to their social media accounts which seems to herald something on its way.</p>
      <p>The band tweeted the following picture of a mountain with their eight-pointed star logo on it, with this simple caption:</p>

      <p>So, what is it? The general consensus seems to be that the image heralds a new album from the alt-metal stars, especially since <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/faith-no-more-are-working-on-new-music/?next">keyboardist Roddy Bottum said he’d been recording new stuff with the other members of the band</a> around this time last year.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“I will periodically go to San Francisco and make music with those guys,” Roddy said in an interview. “What we do is a really special, unique thing that we kind of share - especially like me and Mike Bordin and Billy [Gould, bass]. We were super young - we were, like, 18, 19 years old and when we started making music, so we kind of get in the room and we have a language that speaks really loud and really clear, at least to the three of us. I mean, where it goes is questionable, but we have sort of a language that’s kind of undeniable, a really sort of family sense.</p>
      <p>“I think we all acknowledge that it’s not something that any of us wanna turn our backs on, and it’s kind of fun to do,” he also noted. “So in the hopes of pushing things forward and making new music, we continue to do that, to like get together and make new sounds and just have a dialogue about prospects and songs and where we go in the future.”</p>
      <p>That said, Roddy also acknowledged that the making of Sol Invictus was a “struggle”, saying, “It felt really good and it was a really great exercise in taking us and our inner family sort of like creative process to the next level…It was a place that we kind of needed to go to make Sol Invictus. We had spent a lot of time sort of coming back together and getting to know each other again and making music again and playing old songs, and then it kind of reached a point where it felt kind of dirty to just do what we were doing, just these shows of old songs. So we took it to the next level and that felt really good. I think we walked away from it with really positive optimistic sort of perspectives.”</p>
      <p>Stay tuned and fingers crossed for more Faith No More news in the near future.</p>
