      <p>Prolonged periods of drought, deforestation and recent bushfires across the country have sent koala numbers spiralling down.</p>
      <p>According to Deborah Tabart, chairman of the Australian Koala Foundation, the fires have taken the lives of more than 1,000 koalas, as well as destroying around 80% of their natural habitat, as per <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2019/11/23/koalas-functionally-extinct-after-australia-bushfires-destroy-80-of-their-habitat"><i>Forbes</i></a>.</p>

      <p>The foundation suspected back in May this year that <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/animals/koalas-are-now-functionally-extinct/">there are fewer than 80,000 koalas left in the wild</a>, therefore leaving the species ‘functionally extinct’.</p>
      <p>Functional extinction is when a species’ population dwindles to such a low number that they no longer have a significant role in their ecosystem.</p>
      <p>It also means there are so few pairs left that it is unlikely to produce a new generation, therefore their population is no longer viable. While there will be some reproduction, the long-term viability of the species unlikely, with those born highly susceptible to disease.</p>

      <p>The foundation estimates that there are no koalas left at all in 41 out of 128 Federal environments that are known koala habitats. Since 2012, Koalas have been listed as a ‘vulnerable’ species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List.</p>

      <p>Along with bushfires, deforestation is forcing koalas into starvation, as countless eucalyptus trees – the leaves of which are a main staple of a koalas’ daily diet – are brought down.</p>
      <p>The recent bushfires have seen a renewed call for the Australian government to enact the Koala Protection Act, written in 2016 but still to be put into action.</p>

      <p>Based on the US Bald Eagle Protection Act, it would help to protect koala habitats and eucalyptus trees, as well as protecting the creatures.</p>

      <p>People are still leaping in to save the animals, without the assistance of the law: a grandmother became a hero online recently, after <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/news/grandma-who-saved-screaming-koala-from-bushfire-says-they-share-a-special-bond/">she ran into a bushfire to save a burning koala.</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>Recalling the moment she risked her own life to give the koala, named Lewis, a chance of survival, the woman told <i><a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/nsw-bushfires-koala-rescued-from-flames-may-not-survive-injuries/be828f6e-6216-4062-8fb7-421ca9acf236">9News</a></i>:</b>

      <blockquote>It was vulnerable, all I could think to do was to try and rescue him. We just jumped out and I knew I needed to put something around him as I ran to the tree so I just took off my shirt and covered him with it and tried to get him out of the fire.</blockquote>

      <p>The recent bushfires have heightened awareness around the falling koala population: <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/animals/people-made-koala-mittens-for-animals-whose-paws-got-burnt-in-bushfire/">for evidence that people care</a>, look no further than Port Macquarie Koala Hospital’s <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-thirsty-koalas-devastated-by-recent-fires">GoFundMe</a> page.</p>
      <p>The fundraiser was set up to attract donations to help the hospital treat all the injured koalas. Their initial target was $25,000 – however, at the time of writing, they’ve amassed a whopping $1.45 million from more than 30,000 donors.</p>

He’s now left his Scottish homelands and took up residence at UNILAD as a journalist.</p>
