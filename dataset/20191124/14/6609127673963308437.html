        <b>SCOTLAND is forecast the coldest winter for 10 years - with -13C lows, snow, ice and travel woes, with a weak sun and Arctic chills blamed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The worst winter since 2009-10 is due as the sun is at the weakest point of its 11-year cycle of strength, said The Weather Company, the world’s biggest commercial forecaster.</p>

      <p>The last time the sun's power was as low as now, Scotland saw the bitter 2009-10 winter, Britain's coldest winter since the 1970s, and the 2010 Big Freeze, with the coldest December ever recorded.</p>
      <p>The Met Office says weak UV rays cause cold easterly winds rather than mild westerlies.</p>
      <p>The forecast comes as Scotland faces rain then a -5C two-week 'polar plunge' starting from Friday.</p>
      <p>The Met Office forecast cold polar air arriving from Friday threatening to remain for much of the next two weeks, with snow in the North and threatening the South.</p>

      <p>Met Office forecasters say numerous factors point to cold weather this winter.</p>
      <p>The worst cold with -13C lows will be between January and March, said The Weather Company, founded in 1982, which was bought by IBM for $2billion in 2016.</p>
      <p>An average UK winter temperature 1.4C colder than normal, below 2010-11's 2.43C, would make this Britain's coldest winter since 2009-10's 1.64C, Met Office records show.</p>
      <p>Leon Brown, head of meteorological operations at The Weather Company’s Weather Channel arm, said: “This winter is expected to be the UK's coldest since 2009–10.</p>
      <p>“Solar activity is at a minimum this winter. Air pressure patterns are expected to allow cold Arctic air to affect Britain.</p>
      <p>“Night-time temperatures of -13C are expected this winter. Travel will be affected.”</p>
      <p>The Weather Company chief meteorologist Todd Crawford said: “We are quickly approaching the solar minimum.</p>
      <p>The epic winters of 2009-10 and 2010-11 occurred during the last solar minimum. “We forecast the cold this winter to be focused in January and February.”</p>
      <p>The Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said: “Many things support cold weather this winter, including large snow cover over Siberia and Scandinavia, hints of weakening polar vortex winds and the solar minimum.”</p>
      <p>The Met Office has said: “Low UV output from the sun can contribute to cold winters.</p>
      <p>“In years of low UV activity, unusually cold air forms over the tropics and an easterly flow over mid-latitudes burrows its way down to the surface, bringing easterly winds and cold winters to northern Europe.”</p>
