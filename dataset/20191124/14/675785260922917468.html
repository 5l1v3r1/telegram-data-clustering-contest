      <p>A mum has been charged with murder after her two baby daughters died after being <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/two-sisters-aged-1-2-20941438">left in a hot car</a>.</p>
      <p>Two-year-old Darcey Conley and one-year-old sister Chloe-Ann died after spending hours in their mother Kerri-Ann Conley's car on a 31C day.</p>
      <p>It is alleged Conley had fallen asleep inside the home and left her children trapped in the Mazda outside her home in Logan City, south of Brisbane, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/9NewsQueensland/status/1198512667536707584">9news</a>.</p>
      <p>When she realised her daughters were still in the car, the 27-year-old mum was said to have tried to cool them down with a cold bath, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>Emergency services were called at about 1.30pm, but the babies died from heat stress.</p>

      <p>Conley, 27, was charged just before 11pm on Saturday and is due to appear in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday.</p>
      <p>Police are investigating whether she was under the influence of drugs when her daughters died.</p>
      <p>Darcey's father, who wanted to remain anonymous, said Conley adored her girls and the girls were inseparable.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/crime-and-justice/fathers-tribute-two-little-peas-in-a-pod-were-loved-by-all/news-story/ddcb5ca8ed377f065f18b6dad4e6a5ba">The Courier Mail</a>: "They giggled all the time, the pair of them. Although they were 12 months apart, Chloe wasn't really that far behind Darcey. I think she learnt a lot off Darcey, mannerisms."</p>

      <p>He said he thought of himself as a "father figure" for Chloe as well.</p>
      <p>"Chloe, every time you looked at her, she just had a smile from ear to ear.Â </p>
      <p>"They were just two peas in a pod. They would have been inseparable when they got older. Unfortunately we don't get to see them grow into beautiful young people."</p>
      <p>Experts say the temperature inside a parked car on a warm day can be more than 30C hotter than that outside the car.</p>
      <p>A family friend who often babysat the sisters told <a href="https://twitter.com/9NewsQueensland/status/1198512667536707584">9News</a> she is "heartbroken and devastated" and hopes "justice will be served for them little girls".</p>
      <p>Neighbours have left flower bouquets and stuffed toys outside the family's home on Logan Reserve Road in Waterford West.</p>
      <p>Queensland Police Detective Inspector Mark White said: "Paramedics made attempts to revive those children, unfortunately they were both declared deceased at the scene.</p>
      <p>"The two children showed evidence of being exposed to extreme heat.</p>
      <p>"It's tragic and we are putting a lot of emphasis on supporting our staff, because they do a very difficult job."</p>
