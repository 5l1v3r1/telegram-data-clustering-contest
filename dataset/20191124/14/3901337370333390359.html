      <p>Suarez revealed a couple weeks ago that he had no concerns if the Catalan giants are looking for his long-term successor.</p>
      <p>Inter Milan and Argentina striker Lautaro Martinez is reportedly the front-runner as Suarez's long-term replacementÂ </p>
      <p>With Suarez (32) entering the latter stages of his career, he admitting the Major League Soccer would be a destination that would interest him.</p>
      <p>"MLS is a competition which has grown a lot in the last few years and you can see that with the young players that have moved there in the last two years, above all the South Americans.</p>
      <p>"That shows that the league wants to grow and not just bring in players of a certain age that are going to retire there. They look for that mix to make the league better.</p>
      <p>"I have a contract with Barca and I am very happy here. In the future you never know, it's an attractive league.</p>
      <p>"Given that I have been lucky to have had success at the top level for a long time, what I would look out for [next] is stability for my family and the well-being of my children. They would all make the decision along with me and the United States is a nice possibility."</p>
