      <p><a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/politics/team-india-takes-an-unassailable-lead-in-test-championship/">Team India </a>has cruised to a Sensational Victory in India’s first-ever pink-ball Test at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. Team India trounced Bangladesh with sensational innings and 46 Runs. The major highlight of this test match is that the Pacers have taken all the wickets that have fallen (One Retired Hurt).</p>
      <p>Earlier, only once, Team India pacers have taken all the 20 wickets. That is Joburg, South Africa way back in 2017-18. Joburg is a Pace-friendly pitch and this feat has occurred on an Indian Pitch is known to be spinners-friendly. The feat also indicates the renaissance of India’s Pace Factory.</p>
      <p>Like never before, India’s Pace Bowling Unit is sensational and is treated as the Best in the Country. This is a significant achievement because pace bowling is one area where Team India always lagged. Ishant Sharma bagged the Man of the Match Award taking Nine Wickets including a five-wicket haul in the first innings.</p>
      <p>Umesh Yadav registered another five-wicket haul in the second innings. Interestingly, India Spinners bowled just Seven Overs in the match even as Bangladesh batted for 71.4 Overs in both the innings combined.</p>
