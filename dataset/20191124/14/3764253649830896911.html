        <b>- Nigerians have rejected the death penalty recommended as punishment for hate speech offenders by the bill, saying it is too harsh</b>
      </p>
      <p>Senator Aliyu Abdullahi who is the sponsor of the bill seeking to check hate speech has reportedly given in to the agitations by Nigerians that death penalty will be amended.</p>
      <p>The senator who is the deputy chief whip of the upper legislative chamber made this known in a statement released on Sunday, November 24.</p>
      <p>According to the statement, the lawmaker, who is representing Niger North senatorial district, said the bill will be modified to reflect the views and wishes of Nigerians before it is passed into law.</p>
      <p>Abdullahi also reportedly expressed the willingness of the Senate to accept contributions by critics and supporters of the bill.</p>
      <p>He added that such contributions will help in shaping the bill to ensure it effectively puts a stop to the disturbing trend of hate speech when it becomes law.</p>
      <p>Abdullahi said hate speech has led to the death of many and is a major factor behind depression and suicide in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"We have followed closely arguments for and against the hate speech bill, and seen the reason why some kicked against it.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Given the high respect which we have for Nigerians, we will make amendment to the death penalty aspect that most Nigerians objected to, so that a bill that meets their expectations is passed into law.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>"Clearly from the conversations, Nigerians agree that we have a problem in the society today as a result of hate speech which has fueled so many killings and violence, and is responsible for cases of depression and suicides,” </i>said.</p>
      <p>Citing a World Health Organization report, Abdullahi claimed Nigeria which is the seventh-largest country in the world <i>“has Africa’s highest rate of depression and ranks fifth in the world frequency of suicide.”</i></p>
      <p>He explained that the Independent National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speech to be established will guard against every act of discrimination against Nigerians by way of victimization.</p>
      <p><i>"The overall concern is to curb violence and unnecessary loss of lives and livelihoods of Nigerians due to hate-induced violence,” </i>he said.</p>

      <p>According to the Senate, the bill was solely being sponsored by the deputy chief whip, Senator Abdullahi, based on his conviction.</p>
      <p>Senator Godiya Akwashiki, acting spokesperson for the red chamber, made the Senate's position known.</p>
      <p>He told journalists in Abuja on Monday, November 18, that contrary to widespread impression, the bill was not the idea of the ninth Senate.</p>
