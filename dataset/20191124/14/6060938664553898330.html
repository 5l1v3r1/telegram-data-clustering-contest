      <p>Responding to it, Azharuddin had called him a 'frustrated cricketer".</p>
      <p>The Hyderabad right-hander had courted controversy with his 3D tweet after his omission from the India team for the ICC World Cup (50 overs) in England earlier this year.</p>
      <p>"Just Ordered a new set of 3d glasses to watch the world cup," he had posted in an apparent reference to the chief selector MSK Prasad stating that Tamil Nadu all-rounder Vijay Shankar had been picked (for the WC) for his three-dimensional skills (batting,bowling and fielding).</p>
      <p>Rayudu subsequently announced his retirement when the World Cup was in progress.</p>
      <p>However, he made a comeback to the game in August and led Hyderabad in the Vijay Hazare Trophy and Syed Mushtaq AliTrophy tournaments.</p>
      <p>Rayudu had reportedly decided on Friday to take a break from first-class cricket.</p>
