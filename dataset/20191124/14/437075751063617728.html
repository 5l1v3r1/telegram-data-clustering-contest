      <h1>Editorial: Arrests a good start, but will we see convictions?</h1>

      <p>President Cyril Ramaphosa came into office with an oft-repeated promise to root out the corrupt elements in government.</p>
      <p>For about 21 months, he continued to preach this message, but there is still little evidence that his words have been followed by actions.</p>
      <p>His appointment of Shamila Batohi as the national director of public prosecutions was hailed as a great step, but she has taken time to adjust to the position.</p>
      <p>However, the arrest this week of home affairs portfolio chairperson and former state security minister Bongani Bongo could be a sign that the criminal justice cluster is heeding the call from South Africans who are frustrated by the high level of corruption and the impunity that seems to accompany it.</p>
      <p>Bongo appeared in court on charges relating to the attempted bribery of a parliamentary official.</p>
      <p>He claims that his ANC peers are conspiring against him.</p>
      <p>Then, on Thursday, the Hawks pounced on 10 people in relation to tender fraud in the Amathole district in the Eastern Cape.</p>
      <p>The Hawks also arrested Municipal Infrastructure Support Agent chief executive officer Ntandazo Vimba.</p>
      <p>The Asset Forfeiture Unit has reportedly attached the assets of Regiments Capital and its directors.</p>
      <p>The company has been implicated in reports of state capture.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Read: <a href="https://city-press.news24.com/Voices/ANC%20mum%20on%20NEC%20member%20Bongani%20Bongo%E2%80%99s%20arrest%20">ANC mum on NEC member Bongani Bongo’s arrest </a></b>
      </p>
      <p>So the overall sense this week was that, finally, the Hawks – and hopefully the National Prosecuting Authority – are developing some teeth.</p>
      <p>But as much as their actions lifted the mood and gave us hope, an arrest is only the first step in the delivery of justice.</p>
      <p>We have seen this movie before – the spectacular arrest of suspects in the Estina dairy farm heist (one of the monuments to the corruption of the wasted decade) ended in the charges being dropped.</p>
      <p>We sincerely hope that compelling evidence has been gathered regarding the arrests made this week.</p>
      <p>Anything less will give ammunition to the likes of Bongo, who has sought to politicise his situation.</p>
      <p>Failure to secure convictions will come across as a PR exercise gone wrong and will instead embolden those who continue to steal from the state with impunity.</p>
      <p>So, while we congratulate the law enforcement officials for these baby steps, we need to remind them that their work has only just begun.</p>
