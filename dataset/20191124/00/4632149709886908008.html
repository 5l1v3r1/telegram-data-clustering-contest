      <p><b>By Team Mirror</b> <br/><br/>Ajit Pawar, simply Dada to his supporters, has been attempting to emerge out of his uncle’s shadow for a while now <br/><br/>Forty-one years ago, when Sharad Pawar walked out of Vasantdada Patil’s government with 38 MLAs and went on to become the chief minister, it was termed as a great political coup. The irony wasn’t lost on anyone yesterday, when Ajit Pawar’s early morning volte face and the subsequent drama sent the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena scurrying to control the damage. Pawar termed nephew Ajit’s actions as “indiscipline”, his daughter Supriya Sule blamed him for betraying her trust. By evening yesterday, the NCP had sacked him as its legislature unit head. <br/><br/>The floor test, which is likely to take place on November 30, will decide not only the fate of Ajit’s tenure as deputy chief minister, but his political career as well. Bowling a googly at his uncle is Ajit’s biggest ever gamble. If he can pull this off now, he will create his own legacy. <br/><br/>Those who have followed the Pawar family’s rise vouch that the uncle and the nephew are like cheese and chalk. Sixty-year-old Ajit has always been a stormy petrel, someone who hasn’t cared to cultivate the tact that his uncle is so famous for. But he has the personality, and the following (his supporters address him as Ajit Dada), to overcome the obstacles that are sometimes his own creation. <br/><br/>Who can forget that crass remark in 2013, when parts of Maharashtra were reeling under severe drought? Addressing a gathering near Pune, Ajit said that there was little the state government can do in such times. “If there is no water in the dam, should we urinate into it?” he said. If this wasn’t enough, he followed it up with another cringe-worthy remark, this time on load-shedding. “I have noticed that more children are being born once the lights go off at night. There is no other work then,” he said. <br/><br/>His followers say ‘Dada’s’ straight-talk and no-nonsense approach is misconstrued as arrogance. “Dada’s only fault is he calls a spade a shovel. But ask anybody in NCP and they will tell you he doesn’t make people run around. Whoever approaches him for a favour gets a yes or a no immediately. He doesn’t believe in giving people false hopes and that’s why people in his constituency love him,” a supporter said. <br/><br/><b>THE RISE</b> <br/><br/>Ajit is the son of Pawar’s elder brother Anant, who died when Ajit was still in school. When Ajit was pursuing primary education in Deolali Pravara, Sharad Pawar was the rising star in the Congress. <br/><br/>Ajit’s political innings began in 1982 when he was elected to the board of a cooperative sugar factory. Nine years later, he was elected chairman of the Pune District Co-operative Bank, a post he would go on to occupy for the next 16 years. <br/><br/>This period saw him rise through the ranks, first winning the Lok Sabha election from Baramati, then the assembly election from the same constituency after vacating the Lok Sabha seat for Pawar. Ajit would go on to win the Baramati seat five more times (1995, 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014). He became a minister of state in Sudhakarrao Naik’s government (1991-92), and again in 1992-93 when Pawar returned to Maharashtra as chief minister. <br/>Groomed as Pawar’s successor at the state-level (Supriya Sule had made it clear that she was happy in New Delhi), Ajit’s star was at its zenith when he took over as the state’s deputy chief minister in 2010. <br/><br/><b>THE FALL</b> <br/><br/>As the Modi wave swept away all opposition in the 2014 general elections, Maharashtra too saw a change of guard. Anna Hazare’s movement against corruption saw anger swelling against the Congress-NCP government at the state level. Ajit came under multiple agencies’ scanner, especially his alleged involvement in the Rs 35,000 crore irrigation scam and the Maharashtra Co-operative Bank fraud. <br/><br/><b>EQUATION WITH PAWAR</b> <br/><br/>Talk of unrest in the Pawar bastion has been brewing for a while now. In 2011, when Ajit’s name came up in the irrigation scam, he abruptly resigned from the state government without even informing Pawar. It is no secret that the senior Pawar was furious at the development. That Ajit learnt no lessons from that chapter was evident last month, when Pawar’s name cropped up in the Maharashtra Co-operative Bank scam. This time around, he resigned from the MLA’s post without Pawar knowing about it. <br/><br/><br/>Then there was a problem between the uncle and the nephew when latter’s son Parth Pawar was handed a ticket to contest the Lok Sabha election from Maval in 2019. The senior Pawar was against Parth’s candidature claiming he had no experience, but Ajit did not budge. When Parth lost, Ajit is believed to have blamed Pawar for the defeat. <br/><br/>The emergence of Rohit Pawar, grandson of another of Sharad Pawar’s brothers, as a new-generation leader from the family and his victory from Karjat-Jamkhed assembly seat only added to Ajit’s insecurity, the sources said. <br/><br/>Yesterday, Pawar indicated that Ajit may have joined the BJP under pressure. The next few days will decide Ajit’s political career.</p>
