      <p>The South Pacific’s first-ever free children’s heart hospital will be built in Fiji.</p>
      <p>The Sai Prema Foundation of Fiji in conjunction with the Fijian government and the Ministry of health are working together on this project.</p>
      <p>While making the announcement during Sathya Sai Baba’s 94th Birthday, Singer Sumeet Tappoo who is also a Director of Sai Prema Foundation says the Shree Satya Sai Hospital will provide all surgeries free of charge and there will be no bill counter in the hospital.</p>

      <p>Tappoo says this hospital is built because a lot of children in Fiji are born with congenital heart disease and most of them die because of this heart problem as they do not have the funds for the operation.</p>
      <p>He says this hospital will help save the lives of children in Fiji and the Pacific and also save the hundreds and thousands of dollars spent by their families for their treatment.</p>
      <p>Tappoo adds that this is the largest project that is undertaken by a non-government organisation in Fiji.</p>
