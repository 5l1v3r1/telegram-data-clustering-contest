      <p>Ghana’s High Commission in the United Kingdom (UK) has condemned the ill-treatment of Ebenezer Azamati, a Ghanaian postgraduate student at the University of Oxford.</p>
      <p>Mr Azamati, a member of the Oxford Union, which hosts various speakers at debate programmes in a chamber similar to the House of Commons, was violently sacked from one of the society’s events.</p>
      <p>According to the BBC, Mr Azamati was "accosted" by a security guard when he tried to return to a seat he had earlier reserved before a discussion on 17 October 2019.</p>
      <p>A statement from the Ghana High Commission in the UK said while they “await positive feedback to enable the High Commission to have a meeting with other stakeholders on the matter, the High Commission condemns in no uncertain terms the manhandling by the Oxford Union of Mr. Emmanuel Azamati, especially when they knew that he is visually impaired”.</p>
      <p>The Ghana High Commission said it considers the welfare of Ghanaians studying in educational institutions in the United Kingdom of paramount importance and calls on all such educational institutions and organisations affiliated to them to treat Ghanaian students with respect.</p>
      <p>The High Commission revealed that it was making efforts to contact relevant officials of the University, Oxford Union and the victim.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the victim has said that the treatment meted out to him made him feel "unwelcome in the union, Oxford and even the country".</p>
      <p>The development resulted in the resignation of the President of Oxford Union, Brendan McGrath, who apologised for his "mistakes". He further apologised "for the distress and any reputational damage" to the student.</p>
      <p>The incident has drawn criticisms and condemnation from various organisations with Oxford University tweeting its support for the victim adding that the institution shared "the widespread outrage regarding the unacceptable treatment" of the Mr Azamati.</p>
