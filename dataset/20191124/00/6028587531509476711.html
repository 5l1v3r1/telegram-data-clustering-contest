      <h3>CRYPTO MARKETS</h3>
      <p><b>Bitcoin</b> dipped <b>below $8,000</b> early Thursday, continuing a week-long pattern of <b>slow but steady declines</b> as crypto traders and investors searched for direction, tried to guess the mood of regulators and struggled with “dismal” bitcoin trading volumes.</p>
      <p>This hasn’t stopped <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/11/21/crypto-heavyweights-tim-draper-tom-lee-and-cz-all-see-bitcoin-going-sharply-higher-heres-why/#3c42b04e6344"><b>bitcoin's biggest bulls</b></a> from coming out in force to reassure investors that the digital currency is far from dead. “I think bitcoin payment processors are really going to open the floodgates,” said venture capitalist Tim Draper. Binance CEO CZ has also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/11/21/crypto-heavyweights-tim-draper-tom-lee-and-cz-all-see-bitcoin-going-sharply-higher-heres-why/"><b>weighed in</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The price took a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/11/22/stark-china-warning-causes-bitcoin-to-suddenly-crash-10-as-other-major-cryptos-nosedive/"><b>10% hit on Friday morning</b></a> after the People’s Bank of China warned that it will be cracking down on bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading.</p>
      <p><b>Plus:</b> As the crypto market cools, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2019/11/19/crypto-exchanges-are-dying-but-they-wont-fade-away/"><b>what will happen</b></a> to the<b> hundreds of exchanges</b> that popped up during the height of the market boom?</p>

      <h3>COULD PORNHUB GIVE BITCOIN A BOOST?</h3>
      <p>After <b>Pornhub </b>revealed online payments processor <b>PayPal</b> will no longer support payments for the adult site, a move that Pornhub called “devastating,” some are speculating that thousands of performers could <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/11/18/pornhub-and-porn-stars-could-be-about-to-give-bitcoin-a-surprise-boost/"><b>turn to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to get paid</b></a>. Pornhub’s other payment options currently include check, direct deposit and the <b>digital privacy token verge</b>.</p>
      <p>“We ... are evaluating adding other cryptocurrency payout options,” Corey Price, a vice president at Pornhub, told CoinDesk following news of the PayPal ban.</p>
      <h3>FIDELITY DIGITAL ASSETS OK’D BY N.Y. REGULATOR</h3>
      <p><b>Fidelity Digital Assets</b>, a subsidiary of Boston-based investment giant <b>Fidelity</b>, has been granted a license by New York's financial regulator to offer <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrynpollock/2019/11/21/fidelitys-crypto-branch-nabs-tricky-to-acquire-ny-trading-license/"><b>cryptocurrency trading and custody services</b></a> in the state.</p>
      <p>Gaining regulator approval for these services has not been easy to do in the past: New York and its notorious <b>BitLicense</b> have caused many crypto-focused businesses to look elsewhere. For Fidelity Digital Assets, the aim of achieving this license in New York was to meet the high demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrency services in the financial capital.</p>
      <h3>A BLOCKCHAIN ALTERNATIVE TO LIBOR</h3>
      <p>In what could be a death rattle for the once-hegemonic London interbank offered rate (<b>Libor</b>), a competing index backed by two American companies has announced that it will <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2019/11/19/libor-competitor-advised-by-former-cftc-chairman-chris-giancarlo-mints-2-ethereum-tokens/"><b>use the Ethereum blockchain</b></a> to determine the costs for banks to lend money to each other.</p>
      <p>The alternative rate is called <b>Ameribor</b>, and it’s backed by the <b>American Financial Exchange</b> (AFX) and <b>Cboe Futures</b>. Ameribor’s use of Ethereum shows one early instance of how a product previously provided by a group of banks is <b>now being offered by upstarts and startups</b>. </p>
