      <p>A planting conundrum led a Michigan winery to create a different kind of distillery.At Brys Estate Vineyard and Winery in Traverse City, MI, winemaker Coenraad Stassen didn't quite know what to do with the last 13 acres of the 91-acre property.</p>
      <p>The vineyard and winery is situated on the Old Mission Peninsula with a gorgeous view of East Grand Traverse Bay. But those gorgeous views, perfect for patio sipping of fine wines or relaxing with a glass of frozé, created a dilemma for Stassen, who focuses exclusively on cultivating and bottling wines made from vinifera grapes.</p>
      <p>Those Pinot Noir, Riesling and Chardonnay vines wouldn’t grow on those 13 acres. Throughout the wine regions in and around Traverse City, visitors will find a mix of wineries growing vinifera, hybrid and combination wineries. But Stassen didn’t want to do that. </p>

      <p>“It was too cold to grow vinifera grapes there, and I didn't’ want to grow hybrids,” says Stassen, who got his winemaking start in his native South Africa. “My thing is, if I put out a Merlot, then why should I plant a Minnesota 11-80 cold, hearty variety next to it? For me, that’s a very hard sell.”</p>
      <p>Stassen says that while he understands that some winemakers choose to do that, he didn’t want to go that route. “As a winemaker, if you want to compete internationally in wine competitions, you need to focus on vinifera,” he says.</p>
      <p>Katie Brys, daughter of the vineyard’s owners, came up with the solution: plant a secret garden of lavender.  The Secret Garden of Brys Estate isn’t just lush fields of lavender and other flowers and herbs. It’s also an actual essential oil distillery, perhaps one of the only such distilleries at a vineyard. “We actually have our own essential oil distillery on site,” Brys says.</p>

      <p>In addition to the lavender, she also grows and distils lemon balm, sage and peppermint. Brys staretd growing the herbs four years ago, put in the first distillery two years ago, and today, she has a separate distillery operation on those 13 acres. On 12 of those 13 acres, Brys has 6,000 lavender plants of nine separate varieties, all of which become distilled into her essential oil blend. </p>
      <p>The essential oil operation is practically its own industry. Brys sells hand lotions, soaps, balms, eye masks and other products made and blended with the essential oils she distills. Every holiday, she sells special holiday products online, as well. </p>
      <p>And during the season, she runs a big bridal operation. A lot of local and destination brides end up picking their bouquets with their bridesmaids in her flower fields. Depending on the time of the growing season, visitors can pick their own flowers, herbs and even strawberries and blueberries. They can also purchase ice cream, cookies and other edibles made with the lavender, too.</p>
      <p>“It’s really, really special,” Brys says. </p>
      <p>Stassen says it’s not surprising that the essential oils agritourism has taken off. “Michigan has the second most diverse agriculture in the country, just behind California,” he says.</p>
      <p>But you can’t get California Chardonnay here, he adds. “You can buy Michigan Chardonnay here,” he says. “People have no idea of the beauty and the quality of wines we have here.”</p>
