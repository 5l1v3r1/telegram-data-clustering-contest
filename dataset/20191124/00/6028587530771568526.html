      <p>It’s that time of year when I look at the stack of books that I’ve read and think, “What would the readers of this column enjoy?” And if you would enjoy them, there’s a good chance a customer or colleague might enjoy these books too. So, I’m going to help make your holiday shopping easy. Consider giving the gift of knowledge, and if you want to make it personal, choose a book you know would be meaningful to that person and inscribe a personal message in the front – something that lets them know how much you appreciate them. This year I only read about 30 books, not including several fiction books to help break away from business and spark some creativity. That is fewer than usual – my excuse is the number of articles and e-books I’ve read. I estimate 20 or more … every week. Most of the books I read fall into the customer service and experience genre, but not all. Here are my Top 10 for the year:</p>
      <p>1.      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Experience-Economy-New-Preface-Authors/dp/1633697975/"><i>The Experience Economy: Competing for Customer Time, Attention, and Money</i></a> by B. Joseph Pine II and James H. Gilmore</p>
      <p>We have to start with this one. It’s an updated edition of my favorite business book of all time. That’s a pretty big statement, but when I first read it, and then read it again (and again and again), it continued to resonate with me and take me deeper down the path of customer experience – long before “customer experience” became a popular phrase. If there is one book to read about customer experience, this is it.</p>
      <p>2.      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Excellence-Wins-No-Nonsense-Becoming-Compromise/dp/0310352096/"><i>Excellence Wins: A No-Nonsense Guide to Becoming the Best in a World of Compromise</i></a> by Horst Schulze</p>
      <p>One of my customer service heroes is Horst Schulze, the co-founder and first president of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. Want to learn the thinking behind the creation of one of the world’s most admired brands? Read this book!</p>
      <p>3.      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FRICTION-Untapped-Force-Powerful-Advantage/dp/1260135691/"><i>Friction: The Untapped Force That Can Be Your Most Powerful Advantage</i></a> by Roger Dooley</p>
      <p>Last year I wrote a book about convenience (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Convenience-Revolution-Customer-Experience-Competition/dp/1640950524/"><i>The Convenience Revolution</i></a>), which is all about reducing friction and creating an easy customer experience. I interviewed Dooley for <a href="https://hyken.com/amazing-business-radio-show/amazing-business-radio-roger-dooley/"><i>Amazing Business Radio</i></a> and found his ideas about friction – actually, <i>reducing</i> friction – to be in alignment with mine. In today’s competitive environment, if you want to take your customers’ experience to the next level, find ways to eliminate friction.</p>
      <p>4.      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Amazon-Become-Digital/dp/1260455491/"><i>Think Like Amazon: 50½ Ways to Become a Digital Leader</i></a> by John Rossman</p>
      <p>What better way to learn about Amazon and the way Jeff Bezos thinks than from a guy who was actually an executive at Amazon? He scaled the Marketplace business, which accounts for more than 50% of all units sold at Amazon. He shares more than 50 ideas (as the title implies) that will help you not only understand how Amazon works, but how you can put some of the same strategies and tactics to work for you and your organization.</p>
      <p>5.      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Content-Marketing-Experience-Revenue-Relationships/dp/154451364X/"><i>F#ck Content Marketing: Focus on Content Experience to Drive Demand, Revenue &amp; Relationships</i></a> by Randy Frisch</p>
      <p>I will admit the title caught my attention. Content marketing is a big strategy today. Frisch doesn’t believe in content marketing but in content <i>experiences</i>. He offers a fresh approach on how to deliver personalized experiences that help you engage and connect with your customers.</p>
      <p>6.      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Relationship-Economy-Building-Stronger-Connections/dp/1626346437/"><i>The Relationship Economy: Building Stronger Customer Connections in the Digital Age</i></a> by John R. Dijulius III</p>
      <p>I’m one of Dijulius’ biggest fans. While he’s usually out teaching companies how to deliver great customer service, he’s also the owner of a successful chain of salons and spas. He practices what he preaches, and he recognizes the importance of maintaining relationships despite technology that can drive a wedge between companies and their customers.</p>
      <p>7.      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nincompoopery-Your-Customers-Hate-You-ebook/dp/B07KDZSL4T/"><i>Nincompoopery: Why Your Customers Hate You – and How to Fix It</i></a> by John R. Brandt</p>
      <p>If you’ve ever been upset by a bad customer experience, rather than curse at them under your breath, just think to yourself, “These people are a bunch of <i>nincompoops!</i>” Just thinking the word <i>nincompoop</i> will make you smile and put you in a better mood. Customers who experience <i>nincompoopery</i> (I love that word!) are frustrated with the absurd processes, procedures and policies that some companies thrust upon them. Don’t be one of those companies! Learn to avoid these customer experience pitfalls and enjoy happier customers and higher profits.</p>
      <p>8.      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Love-Just-Damn-Good-Business/dp/1260441229/"><i>Love is Just Damn Good Business: Do What You Love in the Service of People Who Love What You Do</i></a> by Steve Farber</p>
      <p>This is a book about leadership with a focus on how you treat your employees and customers. It comes down to relationships – it’s about loving what you do, who you do it with and whom you do it for.</p>
      <p>9.      <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Customer-Future-Principles-Tomorrows-Business/dp/1400213630"><i>The Customer of the Future: 10 Guiding Principles for Winning Tomorrow’s Business</i></a> by Blake Morgan</p>
      <p>This could have been called <i>The Company of the Future</i>. Blake Morgan shares the principles needed to win in what is now referred to as the digital age. The first principle is foundational: developing a customer experience mindset. The 10th is a focus on ethics and privacy, one of the hot, newsworthy topics of the day. There’s plenty to learn from those two principles and all the ones in between while business as we know it changes at a pace faster than ever before.</p>
      <p>10.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Customers-Leave-Them-Back/dp/1632651513/"><i>Why Customers Leave (and How to Win Them Back)</i></a><i> </i>by David Avrin</p>
      <p>This book is filled with 24 specific reasons customers are leaving you for your competitors – and how to get them to come back. It’s very tactical, which means it’s filled with ideas that you can work on immediately. Avrin delivers these ideas with entertaining stories and relatable lessons. He says, “We have become a world of impatient, intolerant, and demanding customers, and we move on quickly if inconvenienced in any way. Don’t blame the millennial! We have seen the enemy, and it is all of us.”</p>
      <p>There you have it – my Top 10 list of books for this year. There were many other wonderful reads that didn’t quite make it onto this list – and let me tell you, it was difficult to narrow it down and decide! I hope you pick up a book or two from this list, and that you enjoy them as much as I have. As I mentioned, any of these books would make a great gift for your friends, colleagues, or even your customers. The year 2019 isn’t over yet – why not make the most of it and set yourself up for success in 2020 by spending a little time with one of these great reads?</p>
