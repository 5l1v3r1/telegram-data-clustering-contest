      <p>Survivor Series has a tough act to follow. On Saturday night, NXT War Games delivered the action and entertainment for the crowd at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois. On Sunday night, the last of the Big four pay-per-views will attempt to keep things rolling.</p>
      <p>WWE has done a solid job incorporating NXT in with Smackdown and Raw in the weeks leading up to Survivor Series. Because of this, we’ll see some first-time meetings and unique combinations in the ring.</p>
      <p>Here’s how you can watch.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Date:</b> Sunday, November 24</li>
        <li><b>Time:</b> 5 pm ET</li>
        <li><b>TV:</b> PPV</li>
        <li><b>Live Stream:</b> YouTube (Pre-Show) and <a href="https://www.wwe.com/wwenetwork">WWE Network</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The Biggest Draw</h3>
      <p>While there are a plethora of cross-brand angles on tap, the main event and biggest draw will be Brock Lesnar’s defense of his Universal title against Rey Mysterio. Lesnar quickly dispatched former UFC rival Cain Velasquez at Crown Jewel, which helped to add some fire to the feud with Mysterio.</p>
      <p>There’s been some solid promos and overall storytelling in this program, but it’s difficult to imagine Mysterio going over in this match and dethroning Lesnar. Hopefully, this isn’t simply a squash match with nothing more meaningful taking place.</p>
      <p>Aside from the Lesnar-Mysterio main event, we’ll also see several team matches, the NXT Championship, The Fiend Bray Wyatt vs. Daniel Bryan, and more.</p>
      <p>Here is the full card:</p>
      <h3>The Card</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Universal Championship match: "The Fiend" Bray Wyatt (c) vs. Daniel Bryan</li>
        <li>WWE Championship match: Brock Lesnar (c) vs. Rey Mysterio</li>
        <li>Champion vs. Champion vs. Champion match: Becky Lynch vs. Bayley vs. Shayna Baszler</li>
        <li>Team Raw (Seth Rollins, Drew McIntyre, Kevin Owens, Ricochet, Randy Orton) vs. Team SmackDown (Roman Reigns, Mustafa Ali, Braun Strowman, King Corbin, Shorty G) vs. Team NXT (to be announced on Sunday)</li>
        <li>Champion vs. Champion vs. Champion match: AJ Styles vs. Shinsuke Nakamura vs. Roderick Strong</li>
        <li>NXT Championship match: Adam Cole (c) vs. Pete Dunne</li>
        <li>Champions vs. Champions vs. Champions match: The War Raiders vs. The New Day vs. The Undisputed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It would have been great to see the winners of the champion-vs-champion-vs-champion matches given some kind of year-end distinction. However, nothing of that sort has been announced. Instead, we’ll just hope to see something special from the ladies and men involved in Sunday’s matches.</p>
      <p>NXT War Games proved you don’t need a ton of title matches to put on an excellent pay-per-view. Hopefully, Survivor Series follows suit.</p>
