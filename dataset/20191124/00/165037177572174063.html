        <b>Ex-Bayern Munich defender Rafinha has tattoos to mark his triumphs in football, and Flamengo's Copa Libertadores win will now be included.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/rafinha-81427/">Rafinha</a> promised to decorate his <b>heavily-inked body</b> with a <b>new tattoo</b> to celebrate <b>Flamengo's first Copa Libertadores title win</b> since 1981.</p>
      <p>The <b>34-year-old </b>right-back left <b>Bayern Munich </b>at the end of last season, bringing <b>an end to an eight-year stint </b>with the Bundesliga champions.</p>
      <p>He counted <b>a Champions League and seven Bundesliga titles</b> among his honours at Bayern, and Rafinha continued the trend when helping Flamengo to a dramatic 2-1 victory over <b>River Plate</b> in Lima on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Following Flamengo's triumph, Rafinha – who has a host of tattoos to represent meaningful moments in his life and career –<b> vowed to ink his skin once more</b> in honour of the victory.</p>
      <p>"For sure, I will tattoo it, yes.<b> I like to mark my achievements </b>and the tattoo is a form that I find works," Rafinha told reporters.</p>

      <p>"This will certainly have a little space in my body, <b>preferably on my arm</b>, which is where I tattoo my trophies. <b>It will definitely be marked".</b></p>

      <p>"This was my goal, to win titles for Flamengo. I knew it was very difficult because <b>we have one of the most difficult championships in the world</b>, which is the Brazilian championship".</p>
      <p>"And consequently the Libertadores which is the Champions League here in South America.<b> I didn't expect to win a first title so soon</b>. I am very happy to have won this title and made a mark in Flamengo's history."</p>
      <p>Flamengo looked to be heading to a defeat to defending champions River, but<b> two goals in quick succession</b> from <b>Gabriel Barbosa</b> late on secured a remarkable triumph.</p>
