        <b>Manchester United are in dire need of goals. Out of the nine teams above them in the Premier League, only Sheffield United have scored less goals than the "Red Devils". According to the British press, Man United's board are keen to fix this, with Richarlison at the top of their target list.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Daily Mirror claims that the Everton striker has <b>slipped into Manchester United's agenda</b>, with Solskjaer's team reportedly following him very closely.</p>
      <p>So far this season, the Brazilian has scored <b>five goals and has given two assists</b> in the 16 games he has played with the Toffees. At United, they believe his numbers could be <b>even better if he moves to Old Trafford</b>.</p>

      <p>Everton first paid 40 million euros for the former Watford player, with his current contract running until <b>June 2023</b>. </p>
      <p>Manchester United are currently 10th in the Premier League, with <b>only 16 goals in their favour</b>. Very few when compared to top of the league teams, with Liverpool currently at 30, Leicester at 31 and even City with 37. Could Richarlison be the solution to Manchester United's goal drought? </p>
