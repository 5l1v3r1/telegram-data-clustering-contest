      <p>Do you describe your upbringing as dysfunctional?You’re not alone. In fact, according to recent statistics, 70%-80% of Americans consider their families dysfunctional. If you’re in the minority, you might find it hard to imagine not having an emotional connection to family members. It’s proven time and time again that family ties are fundamental to our emotional and psychological makeup.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, dysfunction is such the “norm” in many families it’s often hard for people to recognize healthy relationships. When<i> </i>dysfunction and estrangement is considered normal, children from these families grow up and repeat the cycle with their own families.</p>
      <p>Consider the following findings from recent studies on estrangement:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>10% of mothers are currently estranged from at least one adult child</li>
        <li>40% of participants have experienced family estrangement at some point</li>
        <li>34% of children today are living with an unmarried parent, up from just 9% in 1960, and 19% in 1980.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, two-thirds of children are living in what researchers consider a non-traditional family environment and for U.S. college students, estrangement may be <a href="http://jpbsnet.com/journals/jpbs/Vol_3_No_2_December_2015/4.pdf">almost as common as divorce</a>.</p>
      <h3>What Is Family Dysfunction?</h3>
      <p>Family dysfunction shows up in many ways. Violence, abuse and neglect are the more recognized forms of dysfunction, but subtle issues such as the inability to give unconditional love, addiction issues and poor boundaries contribute to dysfunction. Regardless of what the cause is, the outcome is the same. An unhealthy emotional connection can lead to the breakdown of the family unit and residual shame.</p>
      <p>It’s not unusual for children to feel shame when growing up in a dysfunctional family. These shameful feelings can follow one into adulthood. One way to combat these feelings is to realize that a disharmonious family experience doesn’t have to define you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Recovering from a tumultuous, less-than-supportive childhood requires understanding family relationships as they are, and not how they could have or should have been.</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Like most people, I grew up in a dysfunctional family. For most of my life, I’ve had little to no contact with my parents and siblings. Years have gone by without us contacting each other. We’ve missed weddings, baptisms, funerals and other momentous life events. Broken promises, disappointments, ignorance, pettiness, jealousy and dishonesty, all these circumstances contributed to my family’s dysfunction.</p>
      <p>Today the fallout from the dysfunction continues to affect my relationships. I’m protective of my space and I’m choosy of who I let into it. I prefer a small, closed circle of friends. These individuals are my family. Not a traditional family, but a real family. A family unit that is supportive and steadfast. One that I’ve chosen for myself.</p>
      <h3>Redefining Family</h3>
      <p>This leads me to ask you to consider the concept of family. What is a family? What obligations do we have to our families?</p>
      <p>Most people have strong perceptions of what makes up a “good, normal” family. But what is normal? Accepting dysfunction as normal repeats the cycle and creates chaos.</p>
      <p>I believe strongly that the concept of family is up for discussion. We can define family for ourselves and break the cycle of dysfunction. How we do this depends on our resolve to make a different choice.</p>
      <p>For example, I’ve chosen to create a new family unit for myself that’s made up of close friends who don’t let pettiness, jealousy or disagreements tear us down. Instead, we work to raise each other up.</p>
      <p>Others who’ve come from dysfunctional upbringings have vowed to encourage open communication and unconditional love within the family unit. They’ve acknowledged the problems that caused their unstable childhood and make a conscious effort to not repeat the cycle.</p>
      <h3>Healing from a Dysfunctional Upbringing</h3>
      <p>The effects of growing up in a dysfunctional family can cause repetitive trauma that follows one well into adulthood; it doesn’t have to be this way. Healing and change is possible.</p>
      <p>Accept that sometimes you have to break ties with your “first” family. This is the family you were born into, but it’s not the family you have to stay in. You might have to distance yourself to find peace and security.</p>
      <p>Allow people into your life who you know have your back. Who don’t withhold affection for their gain. Be willing to accept that the definition of a family doesn’t include the word dysfunctional and you’re worth of creating a loving family unit. A real family isn’t defined by blood. It’s defined by a mutual respect and genuine love for each other.</p>
