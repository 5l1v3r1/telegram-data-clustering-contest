      <h1>A Complete List of Players to Win Both the Copa Libertadores and the European Champions League</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15213509" target="_blank">Max Cooper</a></address>
      <p>​Have we all got our breath back? </p>
      <p>Good. In case you have been living under a sizeable rock for a wee while, there was the small matter of the Copa Libertadores final on Saturday evening. </p>
      <p>'Was it good?' I hear you ask.</p>
      <p>Not bad. </p>
      <p>With reigning champions River Plate seemingly in control against Flamengo going into the final minute of the match, the Argentinian side were inexplicably caught outnumbered on the counter attack, and Gabriel Barbosa tapped home to take the game to extra time. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fflamengo-v-river-plate-copa-conmebol-libertadores-2019-5dda50398a147a14d5000003.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8888888888888888&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.0838095238095238&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Only, we didn't make it that far. </p>
      <p>A long ball was pumped towards a tiring and shellshocked River defence, and with the centre-backs falling over themselves, Flamengo had the chance to claim a stunning last-gasp victory. To paraphrase the immortal words of Clive Tyldesley back in 1999: "AND GABIGOL HAS WON IT!"</p>
      <p>Cue scenes of tears from both fanbases, players, managers, and a whole lot of limbs in the air. Gabriel was the match-winner on the day, but there was another Flamengo star who wrote himself into the record books for a very different reason. </p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/ESPN_FDJ/status/1198369867793141761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>

      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/ESPN_FDJ/status/1198369867793141761">​Fuera de Juego</a> revealed that ex-Bayern Munich full-back Rafinha joined an elite list of players to have won both the UEFA Champions League and the Copa Libertadores in their careers, putting his legacy alongside the likes of the imperious Ronaldinho, <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/neymar">​Neymar</a> and Cafú. </p>
      <p>In honour of Rafinha's brilliant achievement, <i>90min</i> takes a look back at all ten stars to have experienced this incredible feat. </p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Dida (Cruzeiro &amp; Milan) </h3>
      <p>One of South America's greatest goalkeepers, Dida rose to fame in Brazil, and in 1997 the shot-stopper helped Cruzeiro to their second Copa Libertadores title, beating Peruvian side Sporting Cristal 1-0 over a two-legged final. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fdida-of-ac-milan-in-action-5dda50598a147a2cd1000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.9398319327731093&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=0.9257142857142857&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.03480859010270775&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.07428571428571429&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The Brazilian star went on to be a World Cup winner with his national side, and also won two Champions League trophies during his spell in <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/milan">​Milan</a>. Dida was instrumental in I Rossoneri's European success in the 2003 final, keeping a clean sheet and saving three penalties in a tense shootout victory over Juventus. The big shot-stopper also claimed a second Champions League medal in his side's 2007 success over rivals <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/liverpool">​Liverpool</a>. </p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Cafú (São Paulo &amp; Milan)</h3>
      <p>Another member of the 2002 World Cup winning side (and not the last, either) has also made the list. Cafú won back-to-back Copa Libertadores with São Paulo in 1992 and 1993, and was part of the Brazil team that lifted the World Cup in 1994. Not a bad few years for the right-back, eh? </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Feuropean-champion-ac-milan-forward-kaka-5dda525a8317e2e43e000003.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.9960504201680672&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=0.9407142857142857&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Cafú then went on to join Milan following a successful spell at Roma, where he featured alongside the aforementioned Dida in I Rossoneri's 2007 Champions League victory over the Reds. The dynamic full-back had breathtaking ability, and is a worthy name on this celebration of superstars. </p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Juan Pablo Sorín (River Plate &amp; Juventus)</h3>
      <p>The first Argentine legend on our list is Juan Pablo Sorín, who won the 1996 Copa Libertadores with Saturday's beaten finalists River Plate. However, Sorín had originally joined <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/juve">​Juventus</a> at the start of that season, but only featured twice for I Bianconeri before being sent back to Argentina. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fargentinian-midfielder-maxi-rodriguez-l-5dda54fc8a147ab591000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8341114223467164&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=0.9571428571428572&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.16433239962651727&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.04285714285714286&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The defender was therefore technically part of both title-winning teams, as River won the Copa Libertadores and Juventus lifted the 1995/96 Champions League in the very same season. This one feels a little bit less deserving, but there we go. </p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Roque Júnior (Palmeiras &amp; Milan)</h3>
      <p>Roque Júnior, another member of the 2002 Brazil side, is the fourth name on this short list. The defender was part of the 1999 Palmeiras side which claimed the prestigious South American Copa after beating Deportivo Cali in a penalty shootout. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fclaudio-villa-archive-5dda56868a147ab223000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.947650171179583&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=0.9885714285714285&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.04929971988795518&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.008571428571428572&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Roque Júnior then made a move to - you guessed it - Milan, where he won the Champions League and Coppa Italia in 2003 - along with the rest of Brazil, it seems. </p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Carlos Tevez (Boca Juniors &amp; Man Utd)</h3>
      <p>Finally, a Premier League legend makes his mark on the Copa Libertadores. Carlos Tevez helped Boca Juniors to continental success in 2003, as they comfortably dispatched Santos by five goals to one over two legs. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fmanchester-united-v-chelsea-uefa-champions-league-final-5dda5882727cd9ae5a000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.9302832244008714&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.049836601307189546&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Tevez finally wound up in England, and the bullish striker was part of the <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">​Manchester United</a> side which defeated <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/chelsea">Chelsea</a> on penalties in the Champions League final in 2008, making John Terry cry in the process. Good times all round.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Walter Samuel (Boca Juniors &amp; Inter)</h3>
      <p>Another Boca Juniors hero stands alongside Tevez now. Walter Samuel was part of the Boca team which dominated South America in 2000, as they beat Roque Júnior's Palmeiras in a penalty shootout to earn the bragging rights. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fbayern-muenchen-v-inter-milan-uefa-champions-league-final-5dda59ea8317e28158000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.9473856209150325&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=0.9557142857142857&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.05098039215686274&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.002857142857142857&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Over in Europe, 'The Wall' was one of José Mourinho's heroes, as the Portuguese boss led <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/inter">​Inter</a> to a dramatic Champions League success in the 2009/10 season, cruising past Bayern Munich 2-0 in the final to cap a historic treble-winning campaign. </p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Ronaldinho (Barcelona &amp; Atlético Mineiro) </h3>
      <p>The first player on this list to win the Champions League before going on to win the Copa Libertadores is the one and only Ronaldinho. The buck-toothed genius won the European edition in 2006 with Barcelona, beating <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/arsenal">​Arsenal</a> in the final. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fatletico-mineiro-v-atletico-nacional-copa-bridgestone-libertadores-2014-5dda5be7727cd93b89000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.7822222222222222&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=0.88&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.1523809523809524&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.12&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Ronaldinho then returned to Brazil where he signed for Atlético Mineiro,​ and the ex-Milan star helped his new side claim their first ever Copa Libertadores success, winning a shootout against Paraguayan club Olimpia. What a legend. </p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Neymar (Santos &amp; Barcelona)</h3>
      <p>From one <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/barca">​ex-Barcelona</a> star to another. Neymar spent ten years at Santos, where he finally won the Copa Libertadores in 2011, before making the big-money move to Catalunya a couple of years later. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fchampions-league-final-barcelona-v-juventus-5dda5cde8317e281e0000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8048552754435108&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=0.8571428571428571&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.0020121381886087767&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.12857142857142856&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Neymar was part of the fearsome 'MSN' strike force, where he teamed up with <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/lionel-messi">​Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/luis-suarez">​Luis S​u​arez</a> to conquer Europe in 2015, defeating Italian side Juventus in the final. </p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Danilo (Santos &amp; Real Madrid)</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-city">​Ex-Manchester City</a> full-back <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/danilo-luiz-da-silva">​Danilo</a> is another player to have conquered South America and Europe - although he couldn't push the Citizens to Champions League success. The Brazilian star won the Copa Libertadores with Santos in 2011, scoring the decisive goal in the final. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fdanilo-l-of-brazil-s-santos-celebrates-5dda5e08727cd9b9aa000001.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.6778711484593838&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=0.6428571428571429&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.05142857142857143&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>After a successful spell at Porto, Danilo joined <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/real-madrid">​Real Madrid</a>, and los Merengues strode to back-to-back Champions League trophies from 2015-17. He is now at Juventus, and will be keen to add a third European prize to his name. ​</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Rafinha (Bayern Munich &amp; Flamengo)</h3>
      <p>And finally, last but not least, the man of the hour - Rafinha! </p>
      <p>The full-back was part of <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/bayern">​Bayern's</a> dominant team which clinched the elusive Champions League in 2013, Arjen Robben snatching a late winner over Bundesliga rivals <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/dortmund">​Borussia Dortmund</a>.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Fflamengo-v-river-plate-copa-conmebol-libertadores-2019-5dda5f4f8a147a49fe000011.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8888888888888888&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.0380952380952381&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Rafinha joined Flamengo earlier this year, and his side once again won a final at the death, Gabigol's goals grasping the unlikeliest of victories from the clutches of defeat. </p>
