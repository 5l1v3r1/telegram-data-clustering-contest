      <p>For what has become a benevolent ritual, Lance Corporal Simon Agbeko, a kind-hearted Ghanaian Police officer who works with the Accra Regional Police Command has once again embarked on fixing damaged state property.</p>
      <p>Lance Corporal Simon Agbeko has become notable for giving back to the community and fixing damaged state facilities including street traffic lights.</p>
      <p>The junior police officer has been filling in some deadly potholes which threaten the lives of drivers and passengers in Accra for temporal usage.</p>
      <p>Simon Agbeko first became inspired to patch up some of the road hazards at the Achimota overhead and the Abeka junction after he drove over the particularly pothole.</p>
      <p>Pulse Ghana reports that he said he filled up the potholes to prevent accidents.</p>
      <p>The project, he also said, forms part of his road safety campaign to drivers and motorists.</p>
      <p>Earlier reports by YEN.com.gh, disclosed that Lance Corporal Agbeko had spent his own money to repair a broken traffic light at Odorkor.</p>
      <p>He also donated wheelchairs to random physically-challenged persons on the streets.</p>
      <p>The benevolent officer purchased canes and crutches as well for these people, some of whom he locates in various mosques and homes across the capital.</p>
      <p>Lance Corporal Simon Agbeko Ekpeagba described these charitable acts as a manifestation of divine directions from God, which he receives in his dreams.</p>
