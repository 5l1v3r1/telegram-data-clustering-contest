      <h1>As Pochettino hovers, Manchester United show they will fight for Solskjaer</h1>

        <b>Abject for 70 minutes and ruthless for seven, Manchester United showed at Sheffield United that they will fight for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>How do you sum up a match like that? <b>"It's football,"</b> was <b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b>'s attempt on Sky Sports. Notably, he added: <b>"The difference between this year and last year's team is huge."</b></p>
      <p>To put it simply, this was another<b> Premier League </b>away game in 2019-20 <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> did not win. To Wolves, Southampton, West Ham, Newcastle United and Bournemouth, now add the name of <b>Sheffield United.</b></p>
      <p><b>Five wins from six games in all competitions </b>before Sunday was enough to suggest Solskjaer had his players turning a corner again. Then, in the week<b> Mauricio Pochettino became available</b>, they produced their worst 70 minutes in months, managed a breathtaking comeback, and still ended the game disappointed at a 3-3 draw. Such is life under Solskjaer: <b>signs of progress and moments of excellence</b> that only seem to make sure the next setback is still newsworthy.</p>
      <p><b>They managed one shot </b>– a league-low under Solskjaer – in perhaps the worst first half of football of his tenure. Solskjaer cackled before kick-off that Phil Jones, in his first league start of the season, might play in midfield and might play in defence.</p>
      <p>That must have been the instruction he gave to the player personally, given <b>the uncertain recklessness </b>with which <b>Jones</b> bludgeoned his way in and out of position. His despairing grimace after he was shoved over by <b>Lys Mousset </b>for the fortunate but fully deserved opening <b>John Fleck</b> goal said it all, occurring as it did just two hours after <b>Chris Smalling</b>, deemed expendable by Solskjaer, was scoring and assisting in a 3-0 win for Roma.</p>

      <p>The 3-4-3, the line-up, the instructions – everything seemed wrong. <b>Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Daniel James were so lifeless</b>, so withdrawn from the action, they might as well have been having a kickabout at Hillsborough 12 miles away. <b>Andreas Pereira </b>found Sheffield United shirts with precision almost every time he had the ball. <b>Brandon Williams</b>, after a promising few weeks in the first team, was bullied and beaten with increasing ease down the left.</p>
      <p><b>Sheffield United were everything the Red Devils were not:</b> well-drilled, hard-working, swift and accurate with the ball, ferocious without it. They pulled the visitors out of position and surged into the gaps, while their opponents played at such an excruciatingly slow pace that <b>46-year-old </b>Solskjaer could probably have joined in. After United took their first corner of the match short and played a handful of slow passes before <b>Fred </b>ballooned a cross out of play, <b>Harry Maguire</b> bellowed at his midfielder to "just put it in the f****** box!". The United Way.</p>
      <p>The headlines were written, the #OleOut cries getting louder, the Pochettino dial turned up to 11. And then, in seven minutes, the youngsters into whose hands Solskjaer has put his job showed they will not let this manager go quietly into the night.</p>

      <p><b>Williams</b> struck a sweet half-volley, becoming<b> the youngest United player in three years to score in the Premier League</b> until <b>Mason Greenwood </b>took that stat for himself five minutes later. When <b>Martial, James and Rashford</b> finally combined, they tore the defence to shreds to make it 3-2.</p>
      <p>It was breathless, barely believable. Pochettino was just the ex-Tottenham manager again as<b> another stunning comeback with Solskjaer's name on it beckoned.</b> But he must share the blame for their failure to see it out. With the hosts looking forlorn and suspect with every attack, Solskjaer blinked, taking off Martial for Axel Tuanzebe in the hope of holding on to what they had. <b>They promptly dropped deep</b>, failed to clear their box and let Ollie McBurnie equalise. The setback was the news again.</p>
      <p>And so <b>Ole remains at the wheel,</b> grinding through the gears, veering into traffic, but his gaze steadfast on the road ahead. <b>United are ninth</b>, closer in points to the relegation zone than the top four,<b> 20 adrift of leaders Liverpool</b>… but fighting. Would they fight for Pochettino in the same way?</p>
