      <p>They had fought over him before, of course. While then a teen sensation at Santos, Real Madrid had met with Neymar’s representative at the time, the controversial Wagner Ribeiro, while Chelsea were also speaking to the attacker.</p>
      <p>The years passed and after becoming a Libertadores winner with his boyhood club in 2011, the established Brazil international crossed the Atlantic two years later with FC Barcelona having won the race to capture his signature.</p>
      <p>Forming the fabled ‘MSN’ trident with Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi that notched an astounding 364 goals, together the South Americans won the Champions League and La Liga twice in addition to the Copa del Rey no less than three times and the FIFA Club World Cup.</p>
      <p>Then came the plot twist. Attempting to step out of Messi’s shadow and scoop the Ballon d’Or, Neymar left for PSG in the summer of 2017 when the Qatari-backed Ligue 1 giants activated his $245mn release clause and left neither Barça nor soccer to ever be the same again.</p>
      <p>To say that the world record transfer hasn’t gone to plan however would be a grave understatement. While no doubt helping the Parisiens to maintain their stranglehold on the domestic scene, an elusive UCL crown that was the main purpose of the purchase has not been forthcoming.</p>
      <p>Nor has adoration from the fans, and at the beginning of June, it was reported that PSG were willing to listen to offers to put the wantaway 27-year-old out of his misery and seal his escape from the ‘golden prison’ described by close friend and former Barça teammate Gerard Pique.</p>
      <p>So desparate were big personalities in the Camp Nou dressing room to see Neymar return that they, as Pique claimed himself, offered to take a pay cut to make it happen.</p>
      <p>But as has long been known, the Catalans weren’t the only party that had been put on red alert by these developments, with their sworn enemies from the Bernabeu making their own separate approach for ‘Ney’.</p>
      <p>In a coup that if pulled off would have matched that when Luis Figo switched from Blaugrana to Blancos colours in July 2000 - and famously saw a pig’s head thrown on the turf when the Portuguese played his first Clasico for his new club in Barcelona - the reasons for its failure have been revealed by Cristina Cubero.</p>
      <p>According to the Mundo Deportivo scribe, president Florentino Perez was aware that PSG would prefer to sell Neymar to him and not his former employers, and therefore preapred a package that would have seen Casemiro, Luka Modric and Keylor Neves heading in the opposite direction.</p>
      <p>In addition to knowing that it would cost him no less than $220mn to acquire his services, though, Perez was also turned off by a $33mn annual salary which he feared would unsettle fellow teammates and lead them to demands pay increases as a result.</p>
      <p>The emergence of Kylian Mbappé an additional factor - as Madrid would instead prefer to bank on the young Frenchman not renewing his contract and completing a self-professed ‘dream’ move to the Spanish capital - the talks were nonetheless at an advanced stage.</p>
      <p>Juni Calafat - Perez’s ‘strongman’ in the luring of Brazilians - was heavily involved, and apparently met Neymar and his father in Paris to be told by the duo that the player was willing to sign for Madrid.</p>
      <p>This is apparently why, when probed on where he wished to continue his career, Neymar ‘remained neutral’ in only insisting on leaving PSG full stop as opposed to defining his preferred destination.</p>
      <p>Maintaining regular contact with Sergio Ramos, as well as compatriots Casemiro and Marcelo via Whatsapp throughout the saga, Neymar, if landed, would have undoubtedly been one of Perez’s greatest achievements as Madrid reconstruct in the post-Ronaldo era.</p>
      <p>But thankfully for Barça - the top brass of whom would have never been forgiven by their main stars and fans alike had it happened - an agreement did not come to pass. As a result, though some corners of the press insist the club lacks financial means, the league leaders can again focus their energies into bringing to Catalonia once again at the close of the current 2019/2020 campaign.</p>
      <p>Before that however, there is a Wednesday date at the Bernabeu between PSG and the 13-times European champions. In it, Neymar can not just damage his former suitors, but also win his way back into the hearts of Culés.</p>
