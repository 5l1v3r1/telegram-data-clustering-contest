      <p>There have been suggestions that Guardiola could stand down as head coach at the end of the 2019-20 campaign to seek pastures new, having <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/news/city-boss-pep-guardiola-hints-at-serie-a-move_378377.html">recently hinted</a> at a switch to Serie A.</p>
      <p>City <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/transfer-talk/news/man-city-lining-up-new-sterling-deal_379945.html">are said</a> to be keen to hand Sterling a new deal to reflect his importance to the side, despite the attacker only penning a fresh contract in the latter stages of 2018.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>The Sun</i>, the England international will not put pen to paper on a Â£450,000-a-week deal until Guardiola's future at the club is addressed.</p>
      <p>The report suggests that Sterling's 'deep bond' with the Spaniard means that an exit could see the 24-year-old consider his own future in Manchester.</p>
      <p>The former Queens Park Rangers youngster has scored 14 times in 18 appearances for City this season, including five goals in four Champions League outings.</p>
