        <b>Chelsea's display in the 2-1 loss to Manchester City proves they are closing the gap in the Premier League, says Frank Lampard.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Frank Lampard</b> believes <b>Chelsea </b>have demonstrated they are <b>on track to close the gap to Manchester City and Liverpool </b>in the Premier League.</p>
      <p><b>Chelsea opened the scoring against City</b> on Saturday, but the defending champions - who are nine points shy of current leaders Liverpool - came back to win 2-1.</p>
      <p>The defeat <b>ends a six-match winning run</b> for fourth-placed Chelsea in the league, though Lampard has no doubt his side demonstrated they have enough quality to challenge the leading teams in the competition.</p>
      <p>"Some big parts were good, some bits we can improve on. That's why there's a gap, that's why there was a gap last year of however many points, that's what City and Liverpool have done," Lampard told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"I think we went toe to toe in the main. A moment of quality from Mahrez and a deflection for the first goal feels like the difference, for me.</p>
      <p>"There was a lot of detail in the game, but I feel like we didn't have that bit of quality that we can have. Games like this can be won or lost in the boxes - and I think it was [the case].</p>
      <p>"We're coming to close the gap. I don't want to shout that too loudly because football is day to day, week to week.</p>

      <p>"Now we have to show our response to a defeat after a great run of wins, it feels like a long time since we lost a game in the league, so now we need to go and straight away get back on it, because I do feel like there were bits of that game that show that we're coming.</p>
      <p>"Of course we're in the early stages, we're three or four months in, we're a team that we're strong last year anyway but some of our players were playing in the Championship last season and there's a bit of a transitional feel to it.</p>
      <p>"I feel if we keep working then we will be coming."</p>
      <p>City won despite posting a possession figure of 46.74 per cent, according to official Opta data, the lowest figure any Guardiola side has registered in 381 top-flight games.</p>
      <p>"It's how we try and play. You can never be comfortable, they had a few good opportunities early on, but so did we," Lampard added of his team's style.</p>
      <p>"I think maybe we got a little bit sloppy in fact, gave them a chance. Good teams, great teams, work to earn their luck. We're in that process. We need to work to make sure that goes in our favour.</p>
      <p>"I felt for big parts of the game, in terms of possession we had more and caused a lot of problems behind their midfield line, but then there were times when we were sloppy trying to pass it between our centre-halves, trying to get our full-backs involved.</p>
      <p>"They pressed well, they're very well organised. They made it hard for us and there's details in our own game to push a bit more."</p>
