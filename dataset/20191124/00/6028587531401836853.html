      <p>As usual, WWE’s premier brand delivered a spectacular show on Saturday night in Rosemont, Illinois. No titles changed hands, but I still felt like I watched meaningful action and stories unfold.Here is my recap and grades for WWE NXT War Games.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Angel Garza def. Isaiah “Swerve” Scott</h3>
      <p>At one point, WWE pay-per-views used to have excellent pre-show matches. That’s changed of late, but War Games’ first match brought the heat. I love the potential of both Garza and Scott. Both men sell well and also have exciting move sets.</p>
      <p>While I thoroughly enjoyed this battle that Garza won by pinfall, I could see how the two of them could work an even more entertaining bout if they met deeper into the card.</p>
      <p>Overall. it was a great start to the evening.</p>
      <h3>Grade: B+</h3>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Rhea Ripley and Candice LaRae def. Shayna Baszler, Io Shirai, Bianca Belair and Kay Lee Ray</h3>
      <p>If I tried to explain to you how much I love Rhea Ripley’s character and talent, you’d think we were related. She lights up a screen during a wrestling event and is one of the most complete performers in any promotion.</p>
      <p>Allow me to cut off my admiration for Ripley individually to acknowledge the excellence of this entire match. The booking was strong in every way.</p>
      <p>Mia Kim was injured after an attack earlier and thus not available for the match. She was replaced by Dakota Kai to prevent the team of being shorthanded. However, Kai would turn on former friend Tegan Nox. Kai beat her mercilessly and attacked the previously injured knee. The attack was appropriately savage and well-placed in the show and match.</p>
      <p>Those events left Ripley and Candice LaRae in a 2-vs-4 predicament. This was perfectly set up for Ripley to look like a monster. She was handcuffed to the ropes at one point in the match, but she’d ultimately connect herself to Baszler with the cuffs. Ripley slammed the NXT Women’s champion through four chairs and got the pinfall. Every woman involved performed greatly and had splash moments. The match was fantastic.</p>
      <h3>Grade: A+</h3>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Pete Dunne def. Killian Dane and Damian Priest to Become the New No. 1 contender for the NXT Championship</h3>
      <p>Immediately after the excellent women’s War Games match, we got another great multi-wrestler bout. I’m convinced it’s impossible for Pete Dunne to work a bad match. The deceptively athletic, kinesthetic genius who uses every part of his being to tell a story in a wrestling ring, was in his bag.</p>
      <p>The blend of Dunne, Dane and Priest was an interesting and almost ideal mixture of sizes, athleticism and presences. A great triple-threat match allows all three performers to shine in a way that we’re used to seeing, and also gives fans a chance to see a few wrinkles. We saw all of that as Dunne earned a chance to challenge Adam Cole for the NXT title on Sunday at Survivor Series. Keep an eye on Priest, who I believe could develop into an excellent heel in WWE.</p>
      <h3>Grade: A</h3>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Finn Balor def. Matt Riddle</h3>
      <p>This match was good, but it felt as if the two men held back a bit. That’s understandable if there are plans to have the two men engage in a longer feud. If not, perhaps we’ll see Balor and Riddle empty the reserves in a separate encounter.</p>
      <p>The vacation and move back to NXT is working well for Balor, as is the heel turn. Both men showed their in-ring prowess with Balor’s work understandably a little cleaner and sharper. Still, Riddle’s frame, comfort level in his gimmick and athleticism makes him an asset in matches.</p>
      <p>The ending was permissible as Riddle had a chance to win after hitting the Bro to Sleep. The idea that Riddle might have won if he had gone for the pinfall after that move rather than looking for the Floating Bro was believable.</p>
      <p>As it was, this was my least-favorite match on a card with no weak links.</p>
      <h3>Grade: B</h3>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Tommaso Ciampa, Keith Lee, Dominik Dijakovic and Kevin Owens def. Undisputed Era</h3>
      <p>The main event was everything you thought it might be when it was announced. There was an element of surprise with the final member of Ciampa’s team left as a secret, and the action was paced perfectly.</p>
      <p>Sometimes it’s easy to forget how good Bobby Fish, Roderick Strong, and Kyle O'Reilly are because Cole is so brilliant. However, all four members of UE were predictably steady. War Games matches are like a short film with an ensemble cast, and every performance carried their weight.</p>
      <p>The fact that Ciampa is back in the ring and performing without visible limitation is amazing. Lee’s in-ring work was great and the same can be said for the stiff, but impressive Dijakovic.</p>
      <p>Owens turned out to be the mystery partner, which was a little underwhelming. I love Owens overall, but I’d hoped for someone a little less predictable.</p>
      <p>Still, this was a fitting way to end a great show. Fans will definitely remember the finish as Ciampa plunged through a table with Cole on his back for a White-Noise-like slam. Ciampa and Cole both deserve massive credit for such a high-risk maneuver to have been performed safely.</p>
      <h3>Grade: A</h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>War Games delivered. The fact that it was so interesting without a title on the line made it all the more impressive.</p>
      <h3>Show Grade: A</h3>
