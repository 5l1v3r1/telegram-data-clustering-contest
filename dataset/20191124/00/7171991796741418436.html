      <h1>Keeping Time With Blinkenlights</h1>

      <p>If we’ve learned anything over the years, it’s that hackers like weird clocks, and they <i>love</i> packing as many multicolored LEDs into a device as is humanly possible. Combine both of those concepts into one project, and you’ve got a perfect storm. So as far as unnecessarily complex timepieces go, we’d say the <a href="http://www.fearlessnight.com/cc4/index.html">“Crazy Clock 4” built by [Fearless Night] ranks up there among the all-time greats</a>.</p>

      <p>This Arduino Pro Mini powered clock syncs the current time via GPS, with a temperature compensated DS3231 RTC to keep it on the straight and narrow between satellite downlinks. Once the clock has the correct time, how do you read it? Well, at the top you’ve got a basic numerical readout for the normies, and next to that there’s a circular LED display that looks like it could double as a sci-fi movie prop. On the lower level there’s a binary clock for the real show-offs, and as if that wasn’t enough, there’s even dual color-coded analog meters to show the hours and minutes.</p>
      <p>[Fearless Night] has provided everything you need to follow along at home, from the Arduino source code to the 3D models of the case and Gerber files for the custom PCB. Personally we think just the top half of the clock would be more than sufficient for our timekeeping needs. If nothing else it should help save some energy, as the clock currently pulls an incredible 20 watts with all those LEDs firing off.</p>
      <p>Should you decide to <a href="https://hackaday.com/2014/05/16/led-clock-looks-cool-and-tells-time/">take a walk down memory lane</a> and check out some of the <a href="https://hackaday.com/2014/06/16/attiny84-powered-minimalist-led-clock/">other interesting LED clocks</a> we’ve featured in the past, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2014/10/26/star-gate-led-clock-has-plenty-of-pizazz/">you’d be busy for quite awhile</a>. But for our money, it’s still hard to beat <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/07/29/a-one-led-clock/">the impossibly obtuse single-LED clock</a>.</p>
