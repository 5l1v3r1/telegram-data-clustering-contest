      <p>It took India just 8.4 overs on day three to take the last three Bangladesh wickets, capping off a dominating performance as they won the second Test by an innings and 46 runs, and the series 2-0.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.icc-cricket.com/match/15304#scorecard">VIEW MATCH CENTRE</a></b><br/><br/>With the victory, India became the first team to win four consecutive Test matches by an innings margin, a record underlining their supremacy in home conditions.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh started day three at 152/6, with Mushfiqur Rahim, unbeaten overnight at 59, being joined by Ebadat Hossain, after Taijul Isman fell to what turned out to be the last ball of the second day.</p>

      <p>With an injured Mahmudullah unavailable to bat, Mushfiqur had only three remaining batsmen for company against India’s unrelenting trio of quicks. The 32-year-old was tied down early by Ishant’s nagging line, even trying to dance down the track to the pacer and missing, inviting a bit of chat from the bowler.</p>
      <p>After facing six deliveries, Ebadat Hossain fell to Umesh Yadav’s bouncer; an attempt to guide the ball over the slip cordon found Virat Kohli at third slip. Al-Amin Hossain was welcomed to the crease by a vicious bumper that pinged off the side of his helmet and ran to the fine leg ropes.</p>

      <p>After the bouncer, Al-Amin went about eyeing gaps in the clustered field, picking up two boundaries off the 38th over from Ishant and racing to 12 off 11 balls. With spin introduced at the other end, Mushfiqur Rahim tried to collect quick runs, reverse-sweeping, and sweeping Jadeja for two fours in three balls, and helping collect 17 runs in two overs.</p>
      <p>However, all chances of a miraculous defiance diffused when Umesh Yadav returned to get rid of Mushfiqur, who was deceived by the bowler's change of pace and ended up sending a top edge straight to cover. Al-Amin continued his little blitz from the other end, clearing his front foot and swinging his bat at back-of-length deliveries to collect two more fours.</p>

      <p>The first ball of the 41st over, however, ended his brief stay, and the innings, with Umesh Yadav claiming a five-wicket haul by extracting a faint edge off a waft that easily settled in Saha’s gloves. With Mahmudullah retired hurt, Bangladesh’s innings folded on 195, failing to cross 200 for the second time in the game and the third time in the series.</p>
      <p>With nine wickets in the match, Ishant Sharma was adjudged Player of the Match, and Player of the Series, acting as the chief architect of the side’s seventh consecutive Test victory - an Indian record.</p>
