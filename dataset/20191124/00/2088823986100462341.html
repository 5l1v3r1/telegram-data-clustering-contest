      <p>GLENS FALLS – The Portville girls volleyball team is back in familiar territory and hopes to again leave as the New York State Public High School Athletic Association champions.</p>
      <p>The two-time defending champion Panthers started the day with a relatively easy 25-13, 25-14 win against Section XI champion Pierson-Bridgehampton, followed by a 25-12, 25-21 win against Section II champion Lake George, with the second set being more challenging than anything to that point.</p>
      <p>It ended with a 25-22, 25-18 loss to Section I champion Valhalla, but Portville's 4-2 record was good enough to get the two-time defending Class C state champion into Sunday’s final at Cool Insuring Arena at noon against Valhalla, which finished pool play 6-0.</p>
      <p>Portville coach Kelly Unverdorben said she and the team had a relaxed frame of mind for the match against Valhalla, as both teams knew they’d be meeting again Sunday.</p>
      <p>“We said, ‘You don’t have anything to lose. Just go out and play, and whatever happens, happens,’ ” Unverdorben said.</p>
      <p>Unverdorben said the Panthers had seen Valhalla in person and also had some film on the Vikings, who jumped out to a 10-4 lead in the first game before Portville rallied, later tying it at 11 and 12. From there, Valhalla regained the lead and hung on.</p>
      <p>In the second game, Portville took a 2-1 lead, but the Panthers never led again, though they did tie it at 9.</p>
      <p>“They played fantastic,” Unverdorben said of Valhalla. “The best I’ve seen them. But we kind of laid an egg; we didn’t serve well.”</p>
      <p>Against Lake George, Unverdorben said the Warriors seemed to start slowly because they had just come off a 2-0 loss to Valhalla, but found their rhythm in the second game. Lake George closed a three-point lead to tie it at 21, but Portville finished with the last four points.</p>
      <p>For the day, sophomore setter Kylie Blessing had 59 assists, 17 kills and seven aces. Junior middle blocker Laura Wilhelm had 26 kills and seven blocks. Eighth-grader middle blocker Olivia Cook had 17 kills and five aces, while junior libero Olivia Emley finished with 28 digs and six aces.</p>

      <h3>Panama sweats it out</h3>
      <p>Panama endured an extra set against Section I champion Haldane, 25-18, to advance to Sunday’s Class D final at noon against Section IV champion Candor.</p>
      <p>The Panthers and Haldane each finished pool play with 3-3 records after they split their match. Panama won the first set, 25-21, but lost the second, 31-29.</p>
      <p>The Panthers scored the first eight points of the match en route to the tiebreaking win.</p>
      <p>“I just told (my girls), ‘Other than you giving me a heart attack like 552 times, great job,’ ” Panama coach Tammy Hosier said.</p>
      <p>“We came out strong the first game and then just let them play their game,” Hosier added about the Haldane match. “I said, ‘Just how bad do you want this? If you want to play volleyball (Sunday), you’ve got to come out strong and play our game.’ ”</p>
      <p>Earlier, Candor swept Panama, 29-27 and 25-22, with Candor rallying in the first game. The Panthers followed with a sweep of Section II Galway, 25-15 and 27-25, in which Galway rallied in the second game to make what looked like a sure win into a battle.</p>
      <p>While senior middle blockers Kylie Schnars and Natalie Angeletti had their share of kills Saturday, Panama got a lot of contributions from different players when it mattered.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had a couple of injuries, so we had different people step up,” Hosier said. “It’s great to see our outsides move and adjust to that.”</p>
      <p>Hosier said she was leaning toward a team-bonding experience Saturday night – something different than she has done in the past.</p>
      <p>Panama was in Glens Falls in this same situation a year ago, in advance of a Sunday final. The Panthers lost in three sets to Bainbridge-Guilford.</p>
      <p>“Just have fun together and not think about volleyball,” she said. “Sometimes you start thinking about that big game, you just stress out about it and don’t play well.”</p>
