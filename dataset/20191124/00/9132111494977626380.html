      <h1>December 17 Referendum: STRANEK backs ‘No’ campaign</h1>

      <p>The Strategic Thinkers Network-Africa (STRANEK) has joined many other campaigners to urge Ghanaians to vote ‘No’ in the upcoming December 17 Referendum.</p>
      <p>The Referendum is for the proposed amendment of Article 55 (3) of the 1992 Constitution which will make local government elections partisan.</p>
      <p>Article 55 (3) states that “subject to the provisions of this article, a political party is free to participate in shaping the political will of the people, to disseminate information on political ideas, social and economic programmes of a national character and sponsor candidates for elections to any public office other than to District Assemblies or lower local government units.’’</p>
      <p>The referendum has become necessary because Article 55 is an entrenched provision of the Constitution and therefore can only be amended through a referendum.</p>
      <p>Government is pushing for a “YES’ vote but STRANEK like the opposition NDC and other relevant institutions says “The involvement of partisan politics at the local level will not only be injurious but will weaken the local government systems.</p>
      <p>“The MMDCEs and Assembly members voted on partisan lines will cause them to do the bidding of their party even if it will be inimical to their municipalities or districts or electoral areas. Their party's position will mostly be chosen over the general wellbeing of their people at the local level,” a statement copied to Joy News stated.</p>
      <p>Below is a copy of the full statement:</p>
      <p>IT IS A NO CAMPAIGN FOR THE UPCOMING REFERENDUM- STRANEK</p>
      <p>Strategic Thinkers Network-Africa (STRANEK) has keenly monitored the issues surrounding the December 17 referendum and has joined the conglomerate to vote NO on that day. The involvement of partisan politics at the local level will not only be injurious but will weaken the local government systems.</p>
      <p>The MMDCEs and Assembly members voted on partisan lines will cause them to do the bidding of their party even if it will be inimical to their municipalities or districts or electoral areas. Their party's position will mostly be chosen over the general wellbeing of their people at the local level.</p>
      <p>Local government is a government-owned by the people and as soon as it is seen fingered on partisan basis, accountability of local government authorities will be done to the party that put them for elections. In the long run, citizens presenting their views, opinions, concerns and proposals to the local government authorities for necessary action to be taken to meet the needs of the community will be disregarded.</p>
      <p>We should not allow politics to take center stage in all nooks and crannies of our country. Politicizing everything so far has affected our development and allowing it to be part of our local government systems should be the last thing we should think of as a country.</p>
      <p>The Electoral Commission must be reminded of being neutral in the upcoming referendum whiles conscientising voters. Officials who go about influencing voters to vote in a certain direction must be heavily brought to order.</p>
      <p>We are indeed all involved in building our motherland.</p>
