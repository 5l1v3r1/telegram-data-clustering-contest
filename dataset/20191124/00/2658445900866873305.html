      <p>A union that started sweet may now end up in a messy way. Already, the issue has been taken to court and the Chief Executive Officer of GoldenBoy Entertainment, Patrick Anyaene, has vowed to get all his money from Nigerian singer, Peruzzi.</p>
      <p>Social Circuit gathered that Davido’s artiste, Peruzzi, was yet to fulfil terms on his contract with GoldenBoy before leaving and this has angered the record company.</p>
      <p>In a caveat obtained by Social Circuit, it read that Peruzzi was still an artiste signed to GoldenBoy. It stated, “GoldenBoy Entertainment has commenced legal proceedings against Peruzzi in Suit No: LD2902GCM/2018 at the High Court of Lagos State. Rather than submit to the jurisdiction of the court, Peruzzi has been going about threatening officials of GoldenBoy with violence. In addition, he has shown so much disdain and disrespect for the judicial process. As it is now, GoldenBoy has not made any amount whatsoever from its intellectual property rights with respect to all works written, produced, co-produced and performed by Peruzzi since the inception of the agreement.”</p>
      <p>Anyaene is currently banking on the court for justice as it was gathered that he had invested a lot of money on Peruzzi before he met Davido. The source said: “Asa Asika, Davido and Peruzzi agreed to pay Anyaene a certain amount of money but he has not received anything from them. He said Peruzzi owes him N120m. The case is now in court and a caveat has been placed on the singer.”</p>
