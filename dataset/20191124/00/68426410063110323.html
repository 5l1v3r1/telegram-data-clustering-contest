      <p>Beland was elected to the head of Desjardins in 1987 and was twice re-elected before retiring from the job in 2000.</p>
      <p>He is credited for having profoundly transformed the credit union in his 13 years at the helm, overseeing its entry into the securities field, the installation of automated tellers, in-branch insurance sales and its Acces-D website.</p>
      <p>He also authored several books and lectured at universities, and remained involved in Quebec public life until his death.</p>
      <p>A number of public figures, including Premier Francois Legault, took to social media to express their condolences.</p>
      <p>Legault praised Beland for his social involvement, which he said helped to advance Quebec.</p>
      <p>“I offer my sincere condolences to all his family and loved ones,” he wrote on Twitter.</p>
