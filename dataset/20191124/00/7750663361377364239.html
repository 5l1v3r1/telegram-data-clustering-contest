      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sam-foley/"><b>Sam Foley</b></a>'s late strike helped lift the Buddies into 10th place in the Ladbrokes Premiership table after <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sean-mcloughlin/"><b>Sean McLoughlin</b></a> had cancelled out <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/brian-graham/"><b>Brian Graham</b></a>'s opener for County.</p>
      <p>Goodwin said: "I'm a happy man â€“ I am always happy when we win. I am a wee bit frustrated because I think it could have been a bit more comfortable. But I am delighted for the players because they showed some tremendous character after going a goal down.</p>
      <p>"We really pushed hard in that second half and what a goal it was to win it. I just think we can make life less edgy for us. But a draw wouldn't have been enough for us today.</p>
      <p>"We had to go and win that game and that's what we did. The equaliser came at a good time and it changed my team talk. But we camped ourselves in their half in the second half and I don't think the County boys will have too many complaints about the final result."</p>
      <p>Goodwin admitted he feared the fans might have turned against them had they not found that late winner.</p>
      <p>He added: "We were probably about five minutes away from being booed off the park so we got a nice ovation in the end. Sam will get all the plaudits but the changes we made all had an impact.</p>
      <p>"Tony Andreu and Kyle McAllister both did well. We got into some great positions and we didn't work the goalkeeper. That's definitely something we need to sort out."</p>
      <p>County were left frustrated at an eighth league match in a row without a win. Co-manager Steven Ferguson admitted they did not deserve to take anything from the game.</p>
      <p>He said: "It's really disappointing from our point of view. I am not going to sit here and say we deserved anything from the game following that second-half performance.</p>
      <p>"We just keep shooting ourselves in the foot because we are not doing things properly. We didn't do nearly enough in the second half and that's a massive frustration from our point of view."</p>
