        <b>Biggest Black Friday ever </b>
      </p>
      <p>Takealot chief executive officer Kim Reid said that he is anticipating the biggest Black Friday yet, a culmination of months of tech and operational business-wide focus to prepare for increased predicted traffic and shopper volumes.</p>
      <p>Takealot’s Black Friday gross merchandise value (GMV) grew 125% from 2017 to 2018, with orders up 127%. Superbalist’s Black Friday GMV has grown on average around 50%.</p>
      <p>Reid said throughout the year they have been working to scale operations across multiple areas within the business.</p>
      <p>“After expanding our Johannesburg distribution centre (DC), our warehouse storage space now stands at 75,000m square.</p>
      <p>“We house over 3.7 million items at any given time, and have opened 47 Takealot Pickup Points in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Gauteng, Kwa-Zulu Natal, Limpopo, Free State and Mpumalanga for order collections and returns, with more to open in the coming months.”</p>
