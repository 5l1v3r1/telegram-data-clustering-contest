      <p>The electric-powered auto racing series Formula E has spent more money than it has made since it was founded in 2014 but as its sixth season gets underway it appears to have finally found the formula for profit.When Formula E launched in 2014 many observers believed that the championship would hit the wall within a matter of months. It was the latest race series driven by a gimmick and followed Superleague Formula, which linked teams with football clubs, Grand Prix Masters for former Formula One stars and A1 Grand Prix where countries fielded teams. All of them ended up in the pits but Formula E has stayed the course.</p>
      <p>Unlike many ill-fated championships, Formula E’s gimmick aligns with the needs of auto makers as it allows them to showcase their green credentials which is becoming increasingly important.</p>
      <p>According to a recent report by the consultancy firm McKinsey, sales of electric vehicles accelerated 63% to more than two million units in 2018 and there is still room for growth as they only represent 2.2% of the overall light-vehicle market. Formula E doesn’t just put EVs on display, it does this on the same roads that consumers use.</p>
      <p>The lack of noise and emissions from Formula E cars allow its races take place in city centers and this has helped it to become the poster boy of the EV industry. Its chairman Alejandro Agag said that the series hit a valuation of $660 million (€600 million) last year though this wasn’t driven by its bottom line.</p>
      <p>The series is run by British company Formula E Operations (FEO) which made combined net losses of $155 million (€141 million) in its first six years. There is good reason for this.</p>
      <p>In 2017 Agag told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-motor-electric-agag-idUSKBN19O1W1">Reuters</a> that “we could have broken even this year but we decided to invest more in marketing and promotion.” He added that “it’s really up to us when we want to go to break even or not. We could be in break even now, we could be in break-even next season but we may decide to invest more in marketing and promotion.”</p>
      <p>Saying that Formula E made a loss because its costs exceeded its revenue is one way of looking at it. Another is saying that it didn’t have enough revenue to cover its costs and there is no doubt about that.</p>
      <p>According to FEO’s latest financial statements, in the year-ending 31 July 2018 it made a $28.4 million (€26.4 million) net loss as it burned up $171.9 million (€159.8 million) of costs but only had $143.5 million (€133.4 million) of revenue. It wasn’t the first time.</p>
      <p>As the graph below shows, FEO’s revenue hasn’t covered its costs in any year since Formula E was launched. Its revenue grew at three times the rate of its costs over this period but that still wasn’t enough for it to ever reach break even. The driving force behind it can be traced back to the origins of the series.</p>

        <figcaption>Formula E's costs have outstripped its revenue since the series launched in 2014<cite>sponsors.formulamoney.com</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Most auto racing rights holders get the majority of their revenue from three main sources: sponsorship, broadcasters and race organizers. FEO’s accounts don’t itemise the amount made by each of these sources as they are components of other categories. The smallest is the miscellaneous group of other income which fell 33.9% to $2.3 million (€2.1 million) last year.</p>
      <p>Race and service related revenues are next up and include fees from broadcasters, corporate hospitality ticket sales and payments from the teams for leasing units at Formula E’s base near to Britain’s Donington race track. Revenue from this category also reversed as it fell by $1.1 million (€1.3 million) to $39.9 million (€37.1 million) in 2018. The remaining revenue more than made up for this crash.</p>
      <p>As shown in the table below, the biggest category is race promotions and licensing income. It accelerated from $56.9 million (€52.9 million) in 2017 to $101.3 million (€94.2 million) last year driven by Formula E securing title sponsorship from Swiss engineering group ABB. The 2018 financial statements don’t reveal the split between sponsorship and race hosting fees from race organizers but as we recently <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2002/9755/files/Motor_Sport_2019-11_Agag_s_Electricity_Bill_NEW.jpg?224">reported </a>in British magazine Motor Sport, analyzing FEO’s results from previous years sheds light on this.</p>

        <figcaption>Fees from race promoters and sponsors form the bulk of Formula E's revenue<cite>sponsors.formulamoney.com</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>FEO’s 2017 financial statements showed that sponsorship revenue came to $50.4 million (€46.9 million) which puts the promotion fees paid by its nine race hosts at just $6.5 million. In contrast, F1 generated $608.3 million from race promotion fees in 2017 making it the biggest single source of revenue for the business.</p>
      <p>Although F1 had 11 more events than Formula E, this still comes to $30.4 million each. It means that F1’s average race hosting fee is a staggering 40 times higher than the amount commanded by its electric counterpart. Formula E has been stuck in the slow lane due to a decision which was made before the series even launched.</p>
      <p>In order to get traction for Formula E, Agag took a different approach to F1 and generally didn’t charge a fee for hosting races in the early days. In fact, in at least one case, Formula E paid a track to race there.</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://issuu.com/squareupmedia/docs/sm78/84">interview</a> for Britain’s Square Mile magazine in 2013 Agag told us that “what we want from the cities is their best premium space. That’s what we ask from the city but we don’t ask for money.” He added that “we also ask for introductions to local sponsors and help with infrastructure, police, health, safety, cleaning and sometimes with building the track. So there is definitely a contribution from the city but there is not a sanction fee as such.”</p>
      <p>There are a number of benefits from racing on city centres. Firstly, the average speed tends to be slower than on permanent tracks which helps Formula E as its cars are around 25% slower than their bigger brothers in F1.</p>
      <p>Racing on city streets also puts Formula E on the doorstep of dense population areas and this has attracted even more manufacturers than there are in F1. Audi, BMW, Jaguar and Nissan all field Formula E teams and are joined this year by Porsche and Mercedes which leads the standings after this weekend’s season-opener in Saudi Arabia. However, Tesla, the world’s most well-known EV manufacturer, is noticeably absent despite the favorable conditions.</p>
      <p>As the Formula E car is largely standard, team budgets only rise to around $10 million annually which is just 3.2% of the cost of competing in F1. This makes it low-risk for manufacturers whilst disruption is kept to a minimum for cities as qualifying and the race take place on a single day rather than two as is the case with many other series.</p>

      <p>It has boosted Formula E’s appeal and in its first season it held races in 10 glitzy locations such as Beijing, Miami and even Monaco. However, the lack of high-octane hosting fees led to it making just $21.3 million (€19.8 million) of revenue. Combined with turbocharged start-up costs, it drove the series to the brink after just a few months.</p>
      <p>In an interview last year with former F1 champion Nico Rosberg, who is a minority investor in Formula E, Agag said that the series needed to make a splash “with big cities, a big display, proper broadcasting so we needed to deploy a lot of capital [and] we had to find that capital.”</p>
      <p>Early investors included Spanish property tycoon Enrique Banuelos as well as Causeway Media Partners, whose founders include Wyc Grousbeck and Mark Wan, the co-owners of the NBA’s Boston Celtics team. “We found some capital in the beginning, but it was not enough. So we were really close to going under,” said Agag.</p>
      <p>“We were running out of capital but we made the first car, and on the back of the first car we raised more capital and then that capital was enough to do three races. But then we ran out of money. We were not supposed to be that much on the edge but shit happens.</p>
      <p>“No one knew. Only two or three employees knew. At one point I owed $25 million to our suppliers and I had $100,000 in the bank, that was the situation.” He added that “we were actually really at the limit. I had to pay the air freight of the cars to go to the Miami race from my [own] pocket.”</p>
      <p>He swerved around the peril thanks to last-minute investment in FEO’s Hong Kong-based parent company Formula E Holdings (FEH). It came from broadcaster Discovery Communications and investment firm Liberty Global which is now the biggest shareholder in the company as shown by the following chart.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“At the Miami race we finalized the deal with Liberty and Discovery, capital came in and from there it’s been a great success story financially,” Agag told Rosberg. The FEO financial statements say that “the company’s solvency is dependent on support from its parent company” so if its shareholders pull the plug, the series could still be in jeopardy. There is no suggestion this will happen but there is no doubt that the shareholders hold the keys.</p>
      <p>Formula E has stood the test of time so it can now command hosting fees but they have been slow to rev up. In September Formula E announced preliminary results for the year to 31 July 2019 which show that it had record revenue of more than $215 million (€200 million), up 50% from last season. Crucially, it made its first-ever underlying profit and a spokesman for the series <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-motor-electric/motor-racing-formula-e-reports-record-revenues-and-first-profit-idUSKCN1VX255">told</a> Reuters that it came to around $1.1 million (€1 million). However, instead of being driven by race hosting fees it was reportedly thanks to sponsorship growth.</p>
      <p>Sponsoring Formula E is an easy way for brands to appear conscientious and it helps them hit their eco objectives. It explains why sponsorship already comprised 49.6% of FEO’s revenue in 2017 compared to just 15.3% of F1’s tally.</p>
      <p>In contrast, asking race organizers to pay for something which was previously free is no mean feat which is why Formula E’s revenue from hosting fees lags far behind the money it makes from sponsorship. It perhaps also explains why so many new events have replaced the launch line-up on the Formula E calendar.</p>
      <p>Its calendar has changed so much over the years that only one of the races from its inaugural season is on this year’s calendar. In turn, this has also led to the series racing in countries like Saudi Arabia which are more famous for oil than clean energy.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, despite being environmentally-friendly, protesters have still put the brakes on some Formula E races. In 2016 locals drove Formula E out of London’s Battersea Park due to the work required to turn the public space into a track. It will return to Britain in July next year with its season-ender taking place on a part-indoor track through London’s Excel exhibition centre which is on private property.</p>
      <p>Formula E hit another roadblock in Montreal after a report revealed that its 2017 race there had a shocking effect on local businesses. Instead of giving traders a boost, 70% of them said that the race had harmed their business. The Formule Citoyenne organization surveyed 70 traders and 49 of them said they experienced a negative impact from the race whilst 28.6% said they made no gain and only 1.4% made a profit.</p>
      <p>According to the group, “although it had a positive impact on some businesses, many traders are still angry at this experience which sometimes cost them a lot.” It added that lost earnings from the race weekend ranged from $500 to $18,000 per trader. One of the driving forces was reportedly the competition between the race facilities and local businesses.</p>
      <p>“Formula E is a mini-village isolated and autonomous, with its facilities, its infrastructures, its universe. A universe that includes food trucks that are not from the area, to the detriment of nearby restaurants,” said a Formule Citoyenne statement. The race got the red light and was dropped from the calendar the following season.</p>
      <p>The FEO financial statements even acknowledge that “risks are apparent in the changing city line-up. Organizing races on city streets brings its own challenges but as city street racing is part of the DNA of the series and holds appeal to a broad market audience, the group continues to pursue effective city/promoter agreements.”</p>
      <p>The slower street circuits and lack of sound have also been a turn off for many gearheads. Nevertheless, according to Formula E, 411 million watched the series on television in the year to the end of July with video views rising 61% to a total of 850 million.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Formula E can convert this interest into higher profits. There is no doubt that time is on its side due to the surging popularity of electric vehicles. In May last year a report by the International Energy Agency predicted that sales of EVs may soar 24% each year on average through to 2030.</p>
      <p>The following month Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecast that by 2050 EVs will account for around 9% of total global electricity demand, up from about 0.2% now. In some places it will be even higher, like Germany, where EVs are expected to account for as much as 24% of demand.</p>
      <p>Even F1 acknowledges that EVs could become dominant and last year its motorsport boss Ross Brawn said “there is nothing to stop us having electric Formula One cars in the future.” Agag was quick to point out that auto racing’s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA), has granted Formula E the exclusive licence to run its single-seater open-wheel electric championship until 2038. As F1 is also an FIA series it would have to respect that.</p>
      <p>This exclusivity and surging interest in sustainability has fuelled further investment in Formula E. As we <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/719159/Swiss-bank-stake-Formula-E-season">revealed</a> in Britain’s Daily Express newspaper, other investors include Swiss bank Julius Baer and New-Wave, the ultimate parent of Weibo, China’s answer to Twitter.</p>
      <p>The FEO financial statements add that in 2018 “the group successfully closed another round of funding, raising approximately €10.5 million of equity (2017 €33 million). The consideration was partly used to repurchase back some of the base shares from the CEO of the group for €5 million.”</p>
      <p>In May last year Agag reportedly tabled a $660 million bid to wrest control of Formula E from its owners but got the red light from them. Seven months later they announced they were on the hunt for a new boss. Agag had run the business from day one but finally gave up the wheel in September this year when he was replaced with Jamie Reigle, a former senior executive at Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Agag remains Formula E’s chairman but he is also launching a new electric off-road championship called Extreme E. It is not a direct rival to Formula E but could still dent its exclusivity.</p>
      <p>Formula E’s other shareholders may not have to wait much longer before they too can race off. In a 2015 interview, Agag said that the series could eventually float on the stock market as it is “a good way to give liquidity to the investors.”</p>
      <p>He added that “when we get to profit the float is definitely an option.” Now that Formula E has hit this landmark, time will tell whether it gets the green light to float.</p>
