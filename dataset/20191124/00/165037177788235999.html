        <b>Sheffield United's energy and drive was often too much for Manchester United to handle, concedes Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United </a>manager <b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b> said <b>Sheffield United "wanted it more than us" </b>during Sunday's pulsating 3-3 Premier League draw at <b>Bramall Lane.</b></p>
      <p>The Red Devils were <b>largely awful against Chris Wilder's side</b> and found themselves <b>2-0 down </b>after 52 minutes courtesy of goals from <b>John Fleck </b>and<b> Lys Mousset.</b></p>
      <p><b>Three goals in seven minutes </b>from <b>Brandon Williams, Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford</b> looked like securing an undeserved victory for Manchester United, but Oli McBurnie struck in the final minute to ensure a share of the spoils.</p>
      <p>"It's not something you can put your finger on here and now, but <b>they looked like they wanted it more than us,"</b> Solskjaer told Sky Sports. "<b>They believed in what they did more than us</b>, but sometimes it's little margins here and there".</p>

      <p>"We maybe had one shot on target in the first half and that's <b>not acceptable; not good enough".</b></p>
      <p>"It's football. Sometimes it's beyond the tactics; <b>it's beyond the passion and drive</b>. The supporters in the first half and the energy of their team compared to ours was <b>such a big difference. </b>Then we get the goal and our energy comes back and the belief comes back in."</p>
      <p>Despite failing to hold onto their lead and claim all three points, Solskjaer believes his side's comeback from two goals down <b>shows they have improved </b>since last season.</p>
      <p><b>"The difference between this team and last year's team is huge," </b>he said. "At 2-0 down, my mind is going back to Everton [they lost 4-0 in April]. Last year we'd have been beaten three, four or five. This is such a big stride forward for them, coming back from 2-0 down to 3-2 up and then of course towards the end, things like that happen".</p>
      <p><b>"It's mixed emotions. </b>You can't be happy because we've not performed for the majority of the game, but then<b> the attitude and the way they turned things around</b> shows what we're capable of."</p>
