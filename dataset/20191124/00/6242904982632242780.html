      <p>Ghana midfielder Thomas Partey has been named among 30 nominees for the 2019 CAF African Player of the Year award.</p>
      <p>CAF released the list for the prestigious award on Sunday with Partey being one of the only two Ghanaians making the shortlist.</p>
      <p>The Atletico Madrid ace has been recognised following an impressive year with both club and country.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old has been outstanding in the Diego Simeone side as he has featured sixteen times in all competitions this season with two goals.</p>
      <p>Partey found the back of the net once during the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.</p>
      <p>He also contributed immensely to the Black Stars' perfect start in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifications just last week where he scored the opener in the 2-0 win against South Africa.</p>
      <p>The tall list will be pruned down to three before the awards ceremony, which will take place on Tuesday, 7 January 2020, at Citadel Azure, Hurghada, Egypt.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC and Egypt star Mohamed Salah won the award last year following his impressive exploits for club and country.</p>
      <p>Partey made the shortlist for last year's award but missed out.</p>
