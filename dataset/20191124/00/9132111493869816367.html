      <p>Deputy Information Minister, Mr. Pius Enam Hadzide has tongue-lashed the National Democratic Congress (NDC) for stating that the Akufo-Addo government is ‘witch-hunting’ the Auditor-General, Daniel Yaw Domelevo for being fearless in the fight against corruption in the country.</p>
      <p>According to the NDC, a recent surcharging of Senior Minister, Yaw Osafo-Maafo for $1 million in connection with the payment to a private firm Kroll &amp; Associates “for no work done”, has got President Nana Akufo-Addo fretting, thus, causing him to mastermind the trumping up of allegations against Mr Domelevo.</p>
      <p>The opposition NDC continued that “Mr. Dumelevo’s unrelenting anti-corruption campaign and fearless surcharge of Senior Minister Yaw Osafo-Maafo over the $1 million Kroll corruption scandal has triggered the angst of President Akufo-Addo who has proven to be a defender of corrupt appointees".</p>
      <p>But speaking on CitiTV’s Big Issue Saturday, Mr. Hadzide noted that his outfit is unperturbed about NDC’s behaviour because the party is noted for its chaotic attitude.</p>
      <p>He argued that Mr. Domelevo is a very articulate man who speaks up anytime he has a problem therefore, he doesn’t need a third party like the NDC among other CSOs to speak on his behalf.</p>
      <p>The Deputy Information Minister stated categorically that government does not have any agenda to remove the Auditor-General from office, neither does it have an interest in the ongoing case.</p>
      <p>“With all the due respect, it is a scandalous suggestion. In worst term, it is a silly suggestion. We cannot encourage this reckless commentary on an otherwise serious suggestion. If there is any evidence, action or inaction that somebody wants to point to even suggest that, somebody’s work is even undermined -that can be put forward rather than just making an unsubstantiated, blanket and fundamental statement that there may be an agenda to remove somebody. These are serious matters and I can assure that the government has no agenda. We have no interest at all.” He bemoaned.</p>
