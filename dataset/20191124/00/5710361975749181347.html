      <h1>Forex - Weekly Outlook: November 25 - 29</h1>

      <p>Investing.com - Persistent uncertainty over the prospect of a U.S.-China trade deal looks likely to keep currency traders from taking on any large directional positions ahead of the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Despite the shorter week, the U.S. economic calendar indicates that both manufacturing and consumption will be in the spotlight. Investors will be monitoring regional manufacturing PMIs for any signs of a slowdown in the factory sector. Consumer confidence data on Tuesday will precede Black Friday, both of which will give insights into the strength of consumer spending. Durable goods orders and a second reading on third quarter GDP will also be closely watched and in the euro zone, Friday’s preliminary inflation data will top the much-watch list.</p>
      <p>The U.S. dollar rose against a basket of currencies on Friday, after data showed U.S. factory and services activity accelerated in November, bolstering the outlook for the economy.</p>
      <p>IHS Markit said its “flash” purchasing managers index for manufacturing rose to 52.2 in November from a final reading of 51.3 in October, while its preliminary services PMI increased to 51.6 this month from 50.6 last month.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/us-dollar-index">U.S. dollar index</a> which compares the dollar against six major currencies, was up 0.28% at 98.17 in late trade.</p>
      <p>The greenback received an additional boost from data showing that euro zone business growth almost stalled this month as activity in the bloc’s dominant services industry increased at a much weaker pace than expected and among manufacturers it contracted again.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/eur-usd">euro</a> was down 0.3% against the greenback at 1.1021 late Friday.</p>
      <p>“That combination is what is pulling the dollar a little higher,” said Vassili Serebriakov, an FX strategist at UBS in New York.</p>
      <p>Despite Friday’s gains, the dollar has remained largely range-bound over the last few sessions. For the week, the <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/us-dollar-index">dollar index</a> was up 0.3%.</p>
      <p>The dollar was little changed against the <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/usd-jpy">yen</a> late Friday at 108.64.</p>
      <p>“The dollar is relatively expensive but I think the market is really looking for signs of a stronger global growth rebound to revive interest in some of the currencies outside of the U.S. but the messages that we are getting are still a bit mixed, both in terms of the PMIs and the news on trade,” said Serebriakov.</p>
      <p>The leaders of the U.S and China on Friday both underscored their desire to sign an initial trade deal and defuse a 16-month tariff war that has roiled financial markets and acted as a drag on global growth.</p>
      <p>But trade talks could flounder if U.S. President Donald Trump signs into law a bill supporting Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters or if U.S. warships keep sailing near islands claimed by China in the South China Sea.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/gbp-usd">British pound</a> weakened on Friday, recording its biggest daily loss in nearly three weeks after PMI data showing British business suffering their deepest downturn since mid-2016, with caution rising before a Dec. 12 general election.</p>
