      <p>Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia has lauded the role of the media in nation-building.<br/><br/>He said quite often when people experience peace and good democratic atmospheres; they turn to take things for granted and think things just occur or happen by coincidence.<br/><br/>“In my years as a banker and a politician, I have no doubt about the power of the media in making or unmaking a nation or an institution. If today in Ghana we have such a peaceful political atmosphere with a highly active population on national issues, the crown of such success must be placed at the door of the journalists, some of whom we celebrate tonight.”<br/><br/>The Vice President said this in his address on Saturday in Accra at the 24th Ghana Journalists Association (GJA) Awards Night and the GJA Platinum Anniversary Celebration.<br/><br/>The event was held under the theme “Democracy, Freedom and Independence of the Press in Ghana: 70 Years of the GJA’s Contributions”.<br/><br/>He said history indicates that the indelible contributions of the media to democratic elections in Ghana started long before independence citing that in the 1951 general elections, the media provided a platform for political parties for citizens’ mobilisation and democracy education.<br/><br/>He said the media continues to serve as a conduit and major outlet for proving qualitative information to the citizenry that electrifies the political atmosphere for the conduct of peaceful elections in Ghana.<br/><br/>The Vice President again cited the instrumental role the media played in the 2012/2013 Supreme Court Election Petition was a litmus test of the profundity of the Ghanaian media in its institutional growth.<br/><br/>“Again, the media is the front burner in agenda-setting for political parties’ manifestos including its core function of surveillance, early warning signals from potential sources of threats to peaceful elections and information dissemination,” he said.<br/><br/>He said some media houses have established election command centres and election situation rooms to monitor, educate and inform the voters on election processed, particularly during voting and declarations of results: stating that “this model is very commendable”.<br/><br/>He said generally, the contributions and attributions of the media at real political participation, representative democracy and policy education; also deserve commendation.<br/><br/>“I must however, admit that some media houses and journalists are yet to appreciate the tenets of circumspection in election publications and conflict-sensitive reporting in order to sustain peace and development in the country.”<br/><br/>Vice President Bawumia said in the midst of Ghana's democratic credentials was the ills of acrimonious politics, exacerbated by the winner takes all system of government; declaring that “that practice unfortunately is heavily chipping away and eroding our political and economic gains.<br/><br/>He said politics of acrimony was exclusionary and a potential source of threat to peaceful coexistence, development efficiency and equal distribution of public good.<br/><br/>“It, therefore, requires a reasoned solution from all stakeholders, particularly from all the political parties to nip this canker in the bud in the spirit of common good and posterity.”<br/>Vice President Dr Bawumia extended his congratulatory message to the awardees.
