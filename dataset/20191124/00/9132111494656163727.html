      <p>Member of Parliament for Okere constituency and Minister for Regional Reorganization and Development, Dan Botwe has expressed worry about the "bastardization of multi-party democracy".</p>
      <p>According to him, the over politicization of the referendum is worrying.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Okay FM’s 'Ade Akye Abia' program, he explained that though his position might be different for the referendum, he still believes that multi-party democracy is the way to go for any developing country.</p>
      <p>"Let's not allow people who have different disdain towards multiparty democracy to hoodwink the country," he said.</p>
      <p>He said if he were President Akufo-Addo he wouldn't give the power of his party members to other party members for now to elect Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) and unit committee members.</p>
      <p>" . . My views are known . . . the issue is that we are having a President who believes so much in democracy and multi party democracy . . . he has the power to appoint people who are 100 percent loyal to him in all the 260 administrative units in Ghana . . . can you imagine if it is not a further deepening of democracy by somebody who believes so much in democracy, what else can that be? " he emphasized.</p>
      <p>The Okere Legislator further argued that the problems of multi-party democracy should not be presented as a justification to stifle democracy. There have been calls by groups and individuals including the National House of Chiefs and opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), who are canvassing for a 'NO' vote on the upcoming referendum to maintain Article 55(3) of the 1992 election.</p>
      <p>Members of the National House of Chiefs are also divided over their position on the exercise. While the President of the House of Chiefs says they support a ‘No' vote, some key members of the body have openly broken ranks with their leader.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the main opposition NDC is canvassing for a ‘No' vote while the President and his ruling party have declared support for the opposite.</p>
      <p>The NDC contends introducing political parties into local level elections will further deepen the partisan politics in communities.</p>
      <p>Article 55 (3) of the 1992 Constitution, which is an entrenched provision, states that “Subject to the provisions of this Article, a political party is free to participate in shaping the political will of the people, to disseminate information on political ideas, social and economic programs of a national character; and sponsor candidates for election to any public office other than the district assemblies or lower local government units”.</p>
