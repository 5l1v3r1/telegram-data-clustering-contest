      <h1>Pep Guardiola Admits Sergio Aguero Injury 'Doesn't Look Good' After Substitution in Chelsea Win</h1>

      <p>​Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has admitted Sergio Aguero's injury status 'doesn't look good', speaking after his side beat Chelsea 2-1 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Citizens secured a big win at the Etihad, coming from behind after N’Golo Kante gave Chelsea the lead. Kevin de Bruyne equalised eight minutes later for City, before Riyad Mahrez netted the winner with a wonderful individual effort to earn the win for the reigning champions.</p>

      <p>While the three points are huge for <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-city">​Manchester City</a>, the victory didn’t come without sacrifice. Striker <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/sergio-aguero">​Sergio Aguero</a> had to come off in the second half, clearly struggling and unable to continue, to be replaced by <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/gabriel-jesus">​Gabriel Jesus</a>.</p>
      <p>The Argentine looked uncomfortable, with Guardiola giving the latest update on the situation. Quoted on the <a href="https://www.mancity.com/news/first-team/first-team-news/2019/november/pep-guardiola-man-city-chelsea-reaction">club’s official website</a>, he said: “It doesn’t look good for Aguero. It’s muscular. The doctor said we will see tomorrow. I’ve no idea how long he will be out.”</p>
      <p>It is a huge blow for Manchester City, who could be without their leading striker for some time in a season which has already been riddled with injury issues. Aguero has scored 13 goals in 15 games, and is the <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a>’s third highest scorer this season with nine goals.</p>

      <p>There were also injury concerns for midfield pair Rodri and <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/david-silva">​David Silva</a>, who had to come off during Saturday’s win. Thankfully for them and City fans, Guardiola reported that their injuries are far less serious than Aguero’s.</p>
      <p>He said: “For Rodri and [David] Silva it is more tiredness and cramps. Rodri was out for a month and games like today are so demanding, but with determination and suffering in certain moments, we did it.”</p>
      <p>Saturday’s win was crucial for City to keep alive any hope of a third successive league title, but Aguero's injury could be the thing that drives the final nail into the coffin. They sit nine points off leaders <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/liverpool">​​​Liverpool</a>​​, who extended their unbeaten start to the season with a 2-1 win at <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/palace">​Crystal Palace</a> earlier on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Reflecting on the game, Guardiola added: “We scored a goal when they were better. Normally we believe to score you have to be better, but they were in that moment. With the problems we have with injuries, we beat an incredible, top side. [It is a] great victory for us and we will see.”</p>
      <p>Manchester City are back at the Etihad next Tuesday, hosting Shakhtar Donetsk in the <a href="https://www.90min.com/categories/champions-league">​Champions League</a>. The Citizens then travel up north next Saturday to meet <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/newcastle">​​Newcastle</a>​ at St. James’ Park.</p>
