      <p>The NCRPO SEA Games SMS and Viber hotline numbers are 0915-983-4636 for Globe subscribers and 0998-325-5626 for Smart subscribers. </p>
      <p>“However, eyeing the sustainability mechanism of the hotline, only SMS and Viber messages will be accounted on the hotlines and strictly no calls at all,” said Sinas in a statement.</p>
      <p>He assured the public of prompt response to queries, reports, and complaints regarding SEA Games made through its official hotline. </p>
      <p>The hotlines, according to Sinas, will be monitored 24/7 by trained and competent policemen assigned in the Operations Division at the NCRPO headquarters. </p>
      <p>Information relayed to the hotlines will be referred to the concerned Task Group Commanders or units for immediate action.</p>
      <p>“We are prepared to make this anticipated biennial regional multi-sport event smooth and peaceful,” said Sinas.</p>
