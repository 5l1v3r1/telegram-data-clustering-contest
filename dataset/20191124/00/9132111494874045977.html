      <p>The Ghana Water Company in the Western Region has told Citi News that it will soon commence full supply of water from its Daboase Treatment Plant, to end the water shortage that has hit Sekondi-Takoradi.</p>
      <p>Currently, there is a daily rationing of the three million gallons of water that the Inchaban Treatment Plant produces, as the transformer at the Daboase Plant broke down on Monday.</p>
      <p>The Western Regional Manager of the Ghana Water Company, Adjei Mensah, tells Citi News that the rationing of water would soon end following the arrival of a new transformer at Daboase to replace the worn-out one.</p>
      <p>“There was a cable blast that affected an underground cable and ECG cable and as a result, the main 5mba transmitter was damaged meaning no power supply to this whole station. For that reason, we have not been able to produce water from Daboase. And so, they have been sharing water since Monday. The little that is produced nearby is about 3 million gallons. But the good news is that, we are almost done fixing the problem. We have to bring the big transformer from one of our stations in Barikese in Kumasi. ECG officials are on-site in Daboase to replace it. Hopefully, by evening, we should start the plant again.”</p>
      <p>The Daboase Water Headworks, which was constructed in 1996, has the capacity to produce six million gallons of water a day for residents of the Sekondi/Takoradi metropolis.</p>
      <p>But it is now producing less than four million gallons a day as a result of the activities of illegal gold miners, popularly called ‘galamsey’, on the River Pra, which is the main source of raw water for the treatment plant.</p>
      <p>The plant has been expanded to produce 22 million gallons of water a day to meet the growing demand resulting from the rise in the population of residents of the metropolis.</p>
