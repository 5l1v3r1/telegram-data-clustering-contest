        <b>The Nokia 9 PureView was an ambitious device that mostly fell flat on its face due to a number of factors. HMD Global is working on the successor to that device, the Nokia 9.1 PureView, and we finally have our first look at a phone that's set to walk the same path as its predecessor.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Nokia-9-PureView-Smartphone-Review.418191.0.html">Nokia 9 PureView</a> was unveiled at the start of the year, over a year after the first set of reports of the device made its way to the grapevine, and after a series of delays. HMD Global is billed a to release the direct successor to that device, the Nokia 9.1 PureView, and a new leak has finally given us our first look at the phone.</p>
      <p>The Nokia 9.1 is depicted in a case, showing a design that looks quite similar to the Nokia 9. The penta-camera array remains unchanged in a world where all the major OEMs are adopting more eye-friendly designs. The phone does appear to be a tad wider than the Nokia 9 PureView, and it would seem that some minor tweaks have been made to the phone's side profiles.</p>
      <p>It's unknown when the Nokia 9.1 PureView will be released. A leak a few weeks ago claimed the flagship wouldn't see the sun until 2020, a baffling move, as it would, just like the Nokia 9, make the Nokia 9.1 PureView dead on arrival. The Nokia 9.1 will almost definitely be powered by the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-Snapdragon-855-SoC-Benchmarks-and-Specs.375436.0.html">Snapdragon 855</a>, and a 2020 release would mean it will be launched in a period when other new devices debut the next-gen Snapdragon 865.</p>
