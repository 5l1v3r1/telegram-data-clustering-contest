      <p>Newly inducted Vice-Chancellor of Accra Technical University, Professor Samuel Nii Odai, has cautioned lecturers of the University against behaviours that contravene the schools Code of Conduct.</p>
      <p>He advised students not to remain silent but report cases of sexual harassment to the appropriate authorities for redress.</p>
      <p>Speaking at this year’s matriculation ceremony of the Accra Technical University, Prof. Nii Odai, said the reputation of any institution needs to be preserved under any circumstance.</p>
      <p>The University, he said, will not condone any form of sexual harassment but remain committed to its policy of zero tolerance for sexual abuse.</p>
      <p>In all, seven hundred and seven students were enrolled for the 2019/2020 academic year to pursue various programmes.</p>
      <p>This year’s admission is the highest the University has ever received. The Vice-Chancellor, Professor Samuel Nii Odai said the University has only two hostels which are inadequate for the student population.</p>
      <p>He said the school is working to secure land to ease the accommodation problem.</p>
      <p>Professor Odai also announced that effective this academic year, HND students will be recruited for top-up courses.</p>
      <p>The Registrar of the University, Adu Adjei Mensah administered the matriculation oath to the newly admitted students.</p>
      <p>Earlier Professor Samuel Nii Odai was inducted into office as the first Vice-Chancellor of Accra Technical University.</p>
      <p>Addressing the gathering, Prof Nii Odai said for Africa to be beyond aid, it needs to reform its educational system.</p>
      <p>He said this will make African graduates more competitive globally and useful for their countries.</p>
      <p>Prof Nii Odai said it is worrying to see young people on the continent leave their countries for greener pastures outside when Africa is well resourced.</p>
