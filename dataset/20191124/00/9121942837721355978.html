      <p>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romanians are voting in a presidential runoff election in which incumbent Klaus Iohannis is vying for a second term.</p>
      <p>Iohannis, a conservative, is facing Social Democratic Party leader Viorica Dancila, a former prime minister, in Sunday’s vote. Polls close at 1900 GMT.</p>
      <p>In the first round two weeks ago, Iohannis won 37.8% and Dancila 22.2%.</p>
      <p>Dancila’s government was ousted on Oct. 10 after losing a confidence vote in parliament. It had been embroiled by allegations of corruption and criticized by the European Union for judicial reforms seen as compromising the rule of law.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month lawmakers backed a minority government led by Prime Minister Ludovic Orban of the National Liberal Party, formerly headed by Iohannis.</p>
      <p>Romania’s president has significant decision-making powers, including on national security and foreign policy matters.</p>
