      <p>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) - An Afghan official says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taliban/">Taliban</a> insurgents have stormed a checkpoint in a central province, killed at least eight Afghan soldiers.</p>
      <p>Anwar Rahmati, the governor of Daykundi province where the attack took place, says four soldiers were also wounded in the hourslong gunbattle.</p>
      <p>He said reinforcements were dispatched early Sunday to the area in Kajran district, driving off the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taliban/">Taliban</a> and killing at least 20 of their fighters.</p>
      <p>Qari Yusouf Ahmadi, a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taliban/">Taliban</a> spokesman, claimed responsibility for the checkpoint attack. He disputed the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taliban/">Taliban</a> casualty figures provided by the governor, and said the insurgents had seized weapons and ammunition.</p>
