      <h1>Man Utd's Struggles on the Road Highlighted by Alarming Defensive Statistic</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/14534390" target="_blank">Robbie Copeland</a></address>
      <p>Having spent to the tune of £130m on new defenders in the summer, there is no denying that Manchester United's defence has improved since last season. </p>
      <p>15 goals conceded in 13 games, while not exceptional, means they can respectably boast the fifth-best defensive record in the <a href="http://90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a> - a sign that there is a reasonably solid base on which to build in the years to come.</p>
      <p>Sunday's <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6503878-sheffield-utd-3-3-man-utd-report-ratings-reaction-to-unbelievable-clash-at-bramall-lane">​3-3 draw with Sheffield United</a>, however proved that there is a lot of work yet to do for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. </p>

      <p>Starting with five at the back, their frailties were there for all to see, and even after clawing back a 2-0 deficit to lead 3-2 with ten minutes remaining, they were unable to hold on as Oli McBurnie struck to secure a draw. </p>
      <p>And though their overall defensive record is not too bad on the face of it, the fact that ten of their 15 goals conceded have come on the road explains in a bit more detail where they need to improve. </p>
      <p>Shipping goals away from home is fast-becoming a serious problem, and if their record at the back this season doesn't prove that, then we can extend it a bit further to demonstrate more clearly. <a href="https://www.optasports.com/sports/football/">​Opta</a> stat arriving in 3, 2, 1....</p>
      <p>The 3-3 draw in Yorkshire was the 12th consecutive away match in which <a href="http://90min.com/teams/manchester-united">​Manchester United</a> have failed to keep a clean sheet. That's their worst run since the 1985-86 season, when they went almost the entire campaign (15 games from September '85 to April '86, to be exact) without a clean sheet on their travels. </p>

      <p>But hey, let's balance it out. It's a very young Red Devils side, and though their defending left plenty to be desired, they at least showed some resolve to dig a result out of the dirt - even though it might not have felt like it straight after. </p>
      <p>In fact, it means the club have avoided defeat in 25 Premier League games when losing by two or more goals, which is three more than any other side - suggesting that famous United flame may still be flickering in there somewhere. </p>
