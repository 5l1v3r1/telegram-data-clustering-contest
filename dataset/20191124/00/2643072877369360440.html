      <h1>Nigeria’s Minister Of Information, Lai Mohammed Disgraced At AFRIMA (Video)</h1>

      <p>A video has emerged on the social media, showing the moment Nigeria’s Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, was disgraced at the 6th All Africa Music Awards (AFRIMA) in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial city.</p>
      <p>Naija News reports that the 6th AFRIMA 2019 held on Saturday night, November 23, at the Eko Hotels and Suites with the minister in attendance as a guest of honour.</p>
      <p>During the event, the minister approached the stage where he delivered his speech at the 6th AFRIMA 2019.</p>
      <p>However, during the speech presentation, the Information Minister was booed by a section of the audience.</p>
      <p>Although it is unclear why the Minister of Culture and Information was met with resounding jeers during his presentation, Naija News understands that this may not be unconnected with the death penalty clause in the proposed National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speech Bill introduced by Senator Sabi Abdullah, the Deputy Chief Whip of the Nigerian Senate.</p>
      <p>Naija News understands that the bill states that any person who violates the law shall be liable to life imprisonment and where the act causes any loss of life, the person shall be punished with death by hanging.</p>
