        <b>Lewis Hamilton reckons Honda's progress sets up a potentially "serious" battle between three manufacturers for the 2020 Formula 1 title.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton and Mercedes swept to the drivers' and constructors' title again in 2019, giving the team its sixth consecutive championship double and Hamilton his fifth crown in six seasons.</p>
      <p>Conversely, Ferrari's challenge fell away early in the year and Red Bull's transitional season with Honda meant it has taken three victories but has failed to mount a sustained championship bid.</p>
      <p>However, after being beaten by the Honda-powered Red Bull of Max Verstappen in the Brazilian Grand Prix, and out-dragged to the line for second by Pierre Gasly's Honda-engined Toro Rosso, Hamilton believes Red Bull will join the title fight in 2020.</p>
      <p>"The Honda's obviously made some big steps and it's great to see another manufacturer as strong as they are now," he said.</p>
      <p>"It means that hopefully next year we're going to have a serious three-way, four-way battle and that's great for Formula 1."</p>
      <p>Verstappen has avoided big predictions throughout the first year of the Red Bull-Honda project but has enthused greatly about the Japanese manufacturer's progress, which has facilitated his strongest season in F1.</p>

      <p>Gasly's surprise second-place finish in Brazil gave Honda its first one-two in F1 since the 1991 Japanese Grand Prix, and Verstappen admitted "I always get reminded with the stats".</p>
      <p>"The pole was the last time in 1991 here in Brazil," he added. "I think it's a good time to start doing these things again.</p>
      <p>"We keep relying on the results from the '90s.</p>
      <p>"I think Honda is definitely on a very good way. Throughout the season they have been improving massively so I am very pleased with it."</p>
      <p>If Honda can power Red Bull to a full title challenge, it will put Hamilton up against Verstappen for the first time.</p>
      <p>After fighting Verstappen, and the other Red Bull of Alex Albon in Brazil, Hamilton said: "It's inevitable that the youngsters are going to come through.</p>
      <p>"There's often a wave of young talent that manages to make its way through to Formula 1.</p>
      <p>"I think Formula 1's got a lot of new young blood with a lot of potential and they really are the future of the sport.</p>
      <p>"Fortunately I feel that while the number [of years] shows a little bit higher, I feel like I'm able to still kick it with these guys.</p>
      <p>"So I'm excited for the future, racing with these guys and if we can get these teams to be closer, then we're going to see more awesome battles like [Brazil] and I think that would be great."</p>
