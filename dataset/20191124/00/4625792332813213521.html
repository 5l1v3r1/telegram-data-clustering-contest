      <p><b>KNOXVILLE, Iowa</b> — Joe Biden labeled the notion that a president can use executive orders to accomplish policy goals as abusive during a Saturday afternoon town hall.</p>
      <p>“We almost don’t want to talk across the aisle. You hear Democrats saying, ‘I’m going to get elected, and I’m going to by executive order do the following.’ Come on. Executive orders are basically menus to abuse power of the presidency," the former vice president said at Knoxville High School in Iowa after attacking his rivals for claiming they can implement things like gun control through executive fiat.</p>
      <p>Biden has <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/joe-biden-criticizes-primary-rivals-for-relying-on-executive-orders-for-policy-positions">long criticized</a> his primary opponents for telling voters they can accomplish things like gun control through the power of the presidency alone.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot that a president of the United States — oh, I love saying this — can do by herself,” Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/2020-democrats-tout-pen-and-phone-plans-to-advance-policies-without-congress">at a campaign stop in Newton, Iowa</a>, in May, in the middle of explaining her plan to combat climate change. Warren has also said she'd use executive authority to help accomplish a number of her other policy plans, including healthcare.</p>
      <p>California Sen. Kamala Harris has promised to use <a href="https://kamalaharris.org/gunviolence/">executive action to ban assault-style weapons</a> and require near-universal background checks on firearm purchases if Congress does not pass a gun control bill in her first 100 days as president.</p>
      <p>"I will put in place a requirement that for anyone who sells more than five guns a year, they are required to do background checks when they sell those guns," the California senator said at a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/04/23/kamala-harris-congress-gun-control-schools-town-hall-vpx.cnn">CNN</a> town hall in April.</p>
      <p>Biden's rhetoric represents a significant escalation in his rhetoric against executive authority. In 2014, President Barack Obama came under fire from both Republicans and constitutional scholars for his "pen and phone" strategy after he reached a stalemate with congressional Republicans over immigration. He initially said that mandating any protections for illegal immigrants exceeded the scope of his authority.</p>
      <p>That year, Obama initiated the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protected the children of illegal immigrants from deportation.</p>
      <p>President Trump has also sidestepped Congress on a host of issues, including declaring a national emergency to redirect federal funds to help build barriers on the southern border and to direct strikes in Syria.</p>
