      <h1>Darnold leads Jets to third straight win, 34-3 over Raiders</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">DENNIS WASZAK Jr.</a></address>
      <p>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) - Sam Darnold threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score, leading the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">New York Jets</a> to an impressive 34-3 victory over the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/oakland-raiders/">Oakland Raiders</a> on Sunday for their first three-game winning streak in over two years.</p>
      <p>Brian Poole returned an interception 15 yards for a TD and the rest of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> defense made things miserable for Derek Carr, who was pulled by coach Jon Gruden with just under two minutes left in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/oakland-raiders/">Raiders</a> (6-5) came into a rain-soaked MetLife Stadium on a three-game winning streak with an eye on a possible <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/afc-west/">AFC West</a> first-place showdown at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city/">Kansas City</a> next week. Instead, they got outplayed by a suddenly resurgent <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> (4-7) team that pulled away in the second half.</p>
      <p>Darnold was 20 of 29 for 315 yards - the fourth 300-yard game of his career - with TDs to Robby Anderson and Ryan Griffin in another efficient outing that helped New York to its first three-game winning streak since Weeks 3-5 of the 2017 season. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> didn’t punt until the 2-minute mark of the third quarter.</p>
      <p>With the game out of reach, coach Adam Gase took Darnold out in the closing minutes and had backup David Fales finish.</p>
      <hr/>

      <p>New York took a 13-3 lead into halftime and came out quickly in the second half. On the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a>’ third play of the third quarter, Braxton Berrios took a short pass from Darnold on a slant and zipped down the field for 69 yards before being pushed out of bounds at the 1. Darnold found a wide-open Ryan Griffin for a touchdown on the next play.</p>
      <p>Griffin, signed to a three-year contract extension Saturday night, has a career-high five touchdown catches this season.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a>’ No. 1-ranked run defense then came up big on Oakland’s first possession of the second half, stuffing Alec Ingold for no gain on fourth-and-1 from the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/oakland-raiders/">Raiders</a> 39.</p>
      <p>New York took over and used some razzle-dazzle, Darnold handing off to Bilal Powell, who flipped it to Jamison Crowder - who then tossed it back to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> quarterback. Darnold then threw to Anderson, who reached up for a 30-yard gain. Three plays later, Darnold connected with Anderson again for a 1-yard touchdown.</p>

        <p>On the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/oakland-raiders/">Raiders</a>’ next possession, Carr’s first-down pass was deflected by Neville Hewitt and landed in Poole’s hands. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> cornerback ran it in from 15 yards, giving New York a 34-3 lead.</p>
        <p>Carr lasted one more series before being pulled for Mike Glennon. Carr finished 15 of 27 for 127 yards with the pick-6.</p>
        <p>Rookie Josh Jacobs, fourth in the NFL in rushing, was held to 34 on 10 carries. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> came in allowing a league-low 79.1 yards rushing, and gave up 67 to Oakland.</p>
        <p>QUESTIONABLE CALLS</p>
        <p>Trailing 3-0 after Daniel Carlson’s 48-yard field goal, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> appeared to score a touchdown on their opening drive for a team-record fifth straight game. But Darnold’s 8-yard pass to Demaryius Thomas was wiped away by a questionable penalty when officials called Daniel Brown for offensive pass interference after a video review. New York settled for a tying 24-yard field goal by Sam Ficken.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a> then benefited from what appeared to be another shaky call on their next drive. Darnold was sacked by Maxx Crosby from the 9, but Maurice Hurst was called for roughing the passer; officials ruled he dived on the pile late. Instead of a huge loss of yardage and down, it put the ball at the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/oakland-raiders/">Raiders</a> 4. Darnold faked the handoff to Le’Veon Bell, then kept the ball, ran up the middle and trucked through D.J. Swearinger for a 4-yard touchdown that gave New York a 10-3 lead early in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>CARR STALLS</p>
        <p>Carr fell to 2-9 in his career in games that started with the temperature below 50 degrees.</p>
        <p>The temperature at kickoff at the Meadowlands was 43 degrees.</p>
        <p>INJURIES</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/oakland-raiders/">Raiders</a>: Rookie WR Hunter Renfrow injured his ribs in the third quarter.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-jets/">Jets</a>: Rookie RT Chuma Edoga left early in the second quarter when he injured his left leg. He was helped off the field without putting any weight on the leg and he didn’t return.</p>
