      <p>Already deluged with data, marketing teams have something new to consider. The marketing agency Media Kitchen is now working with what it calls attention metrics.I recently asked Media Kitchen digital engineering lead Jonathan Kim to fill us in.</p>
      <p><b>Paul Talbot:</b> What are attention metrics and how are they best used?</p>
      <p><b>Jonathan Kim:</b> An Attention Unit (AU) quantifies the quality of ad exposure for programmatic campaigns at the session level. In other words, it adds much needed context to an advertising channel that often prioritizes quantity over quality.</p>
      <p><b>Talbot:</b> What needs did you identify that spawned the creation of attention metrics?</p>
      <p><b>Kim:</b> Programmatic buying and selling platforms make millions of decisions every millisecond, rendering what feels like an infinite amount of ads on websites and in apps.  </p>
      <p>Automation helps with scale and efficiency but there is still much to be desired when you start digging into the logic involved.</p>
      <p>Do we really need to place ads on 10,000+ sites?  Do we need to bid on every ad format on every site?  Should we pay for ads on every device type?  Are these ads really performing as well as the report says?  Can the data be lying?  Without attention-based metrics, you can't answer these questions with high confidence.</p>
      <p><b>Talbot:</b> How do they complement existing data?</p>
      <p><b>Kim:</b> Non attention-based metrics help you craft smart questions.  Attention-based metrics help you answer those questions.  When you have access to both, you have yourself the best of both worlds.</p>
      <p><b>Talbot:</b> How do we validate the quality of the data? </p>
      <p><b>Kim:</b> We use Adelaide.  Adelaide is a new attention analytics service which measures several attention metrics from every session and runs them through an algorithm that is trained to create a proxy for the outcomes our brands seek.  In this sense we’re working with them to build a set of fast-moving media analytics that can be used to optimize on the fly.</p>
      <p><b>Talbot:</b> What’s the relationship between attention and engagement and what can we learn from it?</p>
      <p><b>Kim:</b> This might not be a popular opinion in the space, but I see this as an opportunity to buy fewer ads and establish stronger relationships with publishers/partners who deliver real high-quality results.  There is a lot of waste we can reduce with attention metrics.</p>
      <p><b>Talbot:</b> Which creative approaches work best at getting attention?</p>
      <p><b>Kim:</b> This is an area we're actively exploring, however before one can accurately measure the impact of creative, we need to control for the quality of media.</p>
      <p>For example, great creative on poor media may perform worse than poor creative on great media. This is why products that bring transparency to the quality of media, like Adelaide, are so important.</p>
      <p>Taking a customer-first approach rather than focusing on what the brand wants to sell. Direct-to-Consumer brands do this very well.  The message/visual needs to resonate with the moment, environment and audience.  It's easier said than done.</p>
      <p><b>Talbot:</b> Any other thoughts you’d like to share?</p>
      <p><b>Kim:</b>  As an industry, we often fall in love with new ways to buy ads or testing new ad formats.</p>
      <p>Attention metrics offer a new way to assess ads and explore smarter ways to reduce waste.  In a world with so many ads flooding the space, it's a direction I very much enjoy spending time on.</p>
