        <b>Introduction</b>
      </p>
      <p>Faculty, residents, and students at my university are participating in the <a href="https://www.reviews.org/tv-service/disney-plus-dream-job/">Disney Plus Dream Job challenge</a> to watch 30 Disney films in 30 days. Course directors successfully incorporated the 30 films (and shows) into our preexisting curriculum that teaches <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/psychiatry">psychiatry</a> to future physicians through film and other aspects of popular culture. Views Through the Psychiatrist’s Lens will publish daily blogs throughout Disney Plus Dream Job challenge. Our first blog is on the 1995 film, <i>Toy Story</i>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Synopsis</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Toy Story</b> is a computer-generated film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures that focuses on the relationship between a pull-string cowboy doll named Woody and Buzz Lightyear, an action figure “who thinks he’s an astronaut.” The toys evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner, Andy, to friends who work together to be reunited with him after being separated (1).</p>
      <p>
        <b>What it has to do with psychiatry</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s well-established that the film captures the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxiety</a> of the group adapting to its new member. The focus of this blog will be to examine one potential maladaptive way of coping with the illustrated changes in the group dynamic.</p>
      <p>While the film is primarily seen through Woody’s perspective, we choose to adopt a framework where Buzz is the focus of clinical <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention">attention</a>. At 00:19:20, Buzz flies (falls with style) to prove to Woody that he is a space ranger. The very next scene is a montage to Randy Newman’s <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LRGi1NRpvxQ">Strange Things</a>. While many believe the song captures Woody’s evolving <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear">fear</a> of Buzz becoming the object of Andy’s affection, might the lyrics actually capture Buzz’s <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/depersonalizationderealization-disorder">depersonalization</a>? This theory is supported at 00:47:12 when Buzz sees a commercial at Sid’s house that advertises him as a toy. We then see a dissociated Buzz who hears a (Woody’s) voice telling him, “you are a toy…you can’t fly!” One minute and 15 seconds later, Buzz throws himself down a flight of stairs and breaks his left arm to Randy Newman’s melancholic <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=C2Y7Iz-ePOg">I Will Go Sailing No More</a>. Still in an altered state, Buzz then tells Woody, “I’m a little <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression">depressed</a>.”</p>
      <p>What can cause Buzz Lightyear’s dysphoria, altered state of consciousness, and self-inflicted harm? I believe the answer lies in two peripheral characters in <i>Toy Story</i>. Sid is Andy’s neighbor who demonstrates signs of misconduct and impulsivity. While it’s beyond the scope of this blog to discuss his differential diagnosis, one mental disorder a clinician would consider is <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/adhd">Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</a> (ADHD) which affects approximately 6.1 million (9.4%) children in the US (2). The treatment of choice of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/attention-deficithyperactivity-disorder-children">ADHD in children</a> is stimulant <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/psychopharmacology">medication</a>. One example of a psychostimulant is <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/nootropics">amphetamine</a> such as Adderall®, <a href="https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/drug-addiction/street-names-for-drugs/#gref">which is often shortened to “Addy.”</a> I think it’s interesting that Andy’s name is misspelled in the film (see my teaser image!) perhaps providing another clue that <i>Toy Story</i> is a case study of A<s>n</s>ddy abuse. This theory is further supported by Andy’s sister’s character whose namesake (molly) is a street name for 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/hallucinogens">MDMA</a>) which is a substituted amphetamine.</p>
      <p>In summary, several clues are provided that <i>Toy Story</i> is a case study of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/amphetamines">amphetamine abuse</a> to cope with the anxiety of an abrupt change in the group dynamic.</p>
