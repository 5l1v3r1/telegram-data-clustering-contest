      <h1>Kawhi&amp;#039;s Clippers stay hot against Pelicans, Doncic erupts in Houston</h1>

      <p>The Los Angeles Clippers extended their winning streak to five games after Kawhi Leonard and Paul George helped inspire a 134-109 win over the New Orleans Pelicans.</p>
      <p>Leonard had 26 points, six assists and four rebounds, while George put up 18 points and five rebounds for the in-form Clippers (12-5) in the NBA on Sunday.</p>
      <p>While all eyes were on the star Clippers recruits, Montrezl Harrell led the way with 34 points and 12 rebounds off the bench in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Brandon Ingram had 24 points and eight rebounds for the visiting Pelicans (6-11).</p>
      <p> </p>

        <b>Doncic joins illustrious company</b>
      </p>
      <p>Luka Doncic enjoyed a mammoth performance against the Houston Rockets, posting 41 points and 10 assists for the Dallas Mavericks in a 137-123 win. It saw Doncic join Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Michael Jordan as the only players since the 1983-84 season with at least four consecutive games of 30 or more points and 10-plus assists.</p>
      <p>Spencer Dinwiddie had 30 points in the absence of Kyrie Irving as the Brooklyn Nets held on to beat the New York Knicks 103-101.</p>
      <p>Rockets big man Clint Capela joined Dennis Rodman (1992-93 and 1994-95) as the only players since 1976 to record 19-plus rebounds in seven consecutive games. Capela put up 21 points and 22 rebounds in Houston.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Rockets fall… again</b>
      </p>
      <p>After winning eight in a row, the Rockets are in a slump. Houston have dropped three consecutive games. While Harden had 32 points and 11 assists, he was two of 15 from three-point range. As a team, the Rockets managed just 10 of 44 from beyond the arc.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Doncic dazzles</b>
      </p>
      <p>The second-year star was almost unstoppable in Houston, where he left Harden in his wake.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sunday's results</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dallas Mavericks 137-123 Houston Rockets<br/>Brooklyn Nets 103-101 New York Knicks<br/>Sacramento Kings 113-106 Washington Wizards<br/>Denver Nuggets 116-104 Phoenix Suns<br/>Los Angeles Clippers 134-109 New Orleans Pelicans</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>76ers at Raptors</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is a rematch of last season's Eastern Conference semi-final, which saw the Toronto Raptors (11-4) benefit from Leonard's buzzer-beater on route to their maiden championship. The Philadelphia 76ers (11-5) are riding a four-game winning streak as they head to Toronto on Monday.</p>
