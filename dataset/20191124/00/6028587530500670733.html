      <p>Spain’s Jon Rahm birdied the 72nd hole of the DP World Tour Championship to not only claim the tournament, but with it the European Tour’s 2019 Race to Dubai and also a place in the history books.For a third consecutive year the Spaniard demonstrated his mastery of the Greg Norman-designed Earth Course at Jumeirah Golf Estates in Dubai, completing a final round of 4-under-par 68 for a total of 19-under 269 that left him one clear of a charging Tommy Fleetwood.</p>
      <p>His fearsome affinity with this plot of land has now reaped two wins and a fourth-place in just three visits, no less than 11 of his 12 competitive laps of the track have been sub-70 and he is a collective 52-under-par through his three appearances.</p>
      <p>His dominance elsewhere on the circuit has been less withering, but only to a degree. He has now played 15 regular European Tour events (that is, non-major or World Golf Championship co-sanctioned) and won six of them.</p>
      <p>This season alone he had previously finished 64-62 to win the Irish Open from outside the top 35 at halfway and smashed a third round 63 in the Open de Espana to gain a five-shot advantage over the field he didn’t relinquish.</p>
      <p>He earned a record $3 million for the tournament win and an extra $2 million courtesy of topping the <a href="https://www.europeantour.com/european-tour/rankings/race-to-dubai/rankings/">Race to Dubai</a> rankings.</p>
      <p>Perhaps just as rewarding, maybe, is finding his name etched into the roll-call of European Tour number ones alongside Severiano Ballesteros, his legendary compatriot.</p>
      <p>“I feel almost close to crying,” he said of that feat. “Seve is such an idol to all of us. It’s hard to believe.”</p>
      <p>For those on the outside it was almost as hard to believe that the day ended in such dramatic fashion because three hours earlier Rahm had started his final round with nothing less than a scorched Earth policy, draining an astonishing 140-feet of putts on the first seven greens to card five birdies which gave him a six-shot lead over the field.</p>
      <p>“He looks like a bomber and he was bombing my head in the beginning,” said his playing partner and fellow 54-hole leader Mike Lorenzo-Vera, who eventually claimed third.</p>
      <p>But the procession was derailed around the turn. Rahm made four bogeys in eight holes from the eighth and in the same stretch of holes the courageous Lorenzo-Vera claimed three birdies and five pars.</p>
      <p>Behind them Tommy Fleetwood’s wet sail caught the same wind it did seven days ago. For a second Sunday in a row he thrashed a final round 65, setting a pace that had the long-time leader twitching.</p>
      <p>Prior to this season the Spanish sensation might have imploded at this point. He’s frequently referred to as Rahmbo, but the well-built fictional character he most resembled in the first two years of his professional career was the Incredible Hulk.</p>
      <p>Because as brilliant as he was, his ferocious temper would frequently get the better of him, inflicting damage on inanimate objects as well as himself. Even on this day he was prompted to jam an iron into the turf with such fury it seemed destined for a journey to the centre of the Earth.</p>
      <p>In the past his troubles had often been revealed in the majors. He failed to register one top 20 in his first two seasons playing them, exiting the host towns less like the Hulk than his alter-ego Dr David Banner, the haunting theme tune the soundtrack to another frustrated effort.</p>
      <p>But this season he has notched three finishes of T11th or better in the four championships which define a career.</p>
      <p>Moreover in that Irish Open victory he twice faced moments which in the past might have prompted rage and twice he subdued them.</p>
      <p>On this final Sunday of the year he bettered those examples of maturity.</p>
      <p>“It was hard because I lost my swing a little bit,” he admitted.</p>
      <p>“When we got to 16 I told my caddie that I heard Jack (Nicklaus) say that when he won the Open at Muirfield he told himself on the 16th tee that finishing 3-4-4 would see him win. So I told myself, ‘Well, Jon, you’re on the 16th tee, if you finish 4-3-4 you’ll win the tournament.’”</p>
      <p>Here was an example of how he had replaced clothes-shredding fury with self-control and he would repeat it on the final hole.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to believe,” he said. “But apart from the final putt, the first three shots on 18 were as calm as I had been all day. I told myself, ‘How many times do you dream of making birdie to win? Well, now you know have that possibility. Take it.’”</p>
      <p>Afterward he prompted laughter when discussing the on-going tussle with his temper.</p>
      <p>“I’d be above average when it comes to not being calm,” he said. “It’s a work in progress and I can’t turn off my feelings. I’m not a robot.</p>
      <p>“There were times out there when I could have completely lost my mind, but I didn’t and the 18th was verification of that.”</p>
      <p>Adding fuel to the notion that his upward curve is very far from it’s high point was another reflection. Because he knew that with this win he had passed another, distinctly different and potentially rewarding (beyond the money), sense.</p>
      <p>“I’ve cruised to wins in the past,” he said. “But I’ve never had to grind it out for them like that. It was hard mentally to re-focus and put everything in perspective, to remember I had a chance to win. But I did it.”</p>
      <p>Jon Rahm has conquered Earth, not once, but twice. Next, is the world.</p>
