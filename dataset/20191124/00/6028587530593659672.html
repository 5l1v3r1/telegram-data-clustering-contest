      <p>Is the thrill gone? And if so, why?</p>
      <p>While consumers want to support socially responsible companies, the momentum for a wide range of socially and environmentally minded actions appears to have stalled. That includes everything from recycling and reducing consumption to buying products and services from impact-oriented businesses. Plus, even Millennials are less apt to embrace conscious consumer spending and behavior.</p>
      <p>Also, consumers’ definition of what makes for a socially responsible company or organization is definitely different from the one used by people involved in the world of impact.</p>
      <p>Those are some of the findings of the seventh annual <a href="https://goodmustgrow.com/cms/resources/ccsi/ccsindex-2019-pr.pdf">Conscious Consumer Spending Index </a>(#CCSIndex) survey. Conducted by <a href="https://goodmustgrow.com/">Good.Must.Grow.</a>, a socially responsible marketing consultancy, it polled 1,057 Americans to produce a Spending Index score calculated by evaluating the importance consumers place on several areas–purchasing from socially responsible companies, actions taken to support such products and services and intent to increase the amount they spend with these organizations.</p>
      <p>The bottom line: The percent of Americans indicating enthusiasm about conscious spending has declined every year since the survey was introduced.</p>
      <p>“A lot of studies report that the majority of people want to do the right thing,” says Heath Shackleford, founder of Good. Must. Grow. “But we wanted to gauge whether there’s momentum and, if not, what can we do about it before it becomes a bigger problem.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>A Drop Across Categories</b>
      </p>
      <p>While there was a decline in every category, the biggest drop came in “being green”. That hit a high of 90% in 2015; this year, only 77% of respondents reported being green by recycling, properly disposing of waste and favoring reusable products. Meanwhile, while 79% of consumers said they reduced consumption in 2013, just 64% agreed with that statement in 2019.</p>
      <p>Also there was a noteworthy decline in sentiment among Millennials, typically regarded as a cohort that embraces conscious consumerism. Americans aged 18-24 and 25-34 saw the most significant drop in Index scoring, with scores for each falling 12 points over the past three years.</p>
      <p>Shackleford attributes some of the decline to consumers’ lack of confidence in their ability to drive change, plus an overall pessimism about the state of the world. According to the survey, 8 out of 10 consumers feel that the world is going in the wrong direction, a sentiment that has been shown to decrease engagement with socially responsible behaviors.  “There’s a lot of divisiveness in our society,” says Shackleford. “People feel overwhelmed and don’t know who to trust.”</p>
      <p>He points to the matter of recycling as an example. “Consumers recycle and feel they’re doing something positive,” he says. “Then they read articles about how recycling is broken.” It all breeds what Shackleford terms a kind of “paralysis” among consumers.</p>
      <p>But the biggest problem may be a lack of understanding. Forty percent of respondents pointed to a paucity of clear information about where to find socially responsible products and services as a major stumbling block. And, 41% were unable to name a specific socially responsible company or organization. Those who did provide a suggestion came up with some surprising candidates. For example, top of the list was Amazon, followed by Google and Walmart. Several high-profile companies usually associated with socially responsible practices that consumers cited in previous polls—Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Honest Company, Patagonia, Trader Joe’s—didn’t make the list. According to Shackleford, for two years or so, TOMS claimed a higher-up position. But, he attributes that result to the extensive press the company received at the time. “It was front and center with consumers,” he says.</p>
