      <h1>Ciara And Megan Thee Stallion Meet Up For A Twerk Session Online</h1>

      <p>According to a report from PageSix.com, Ciara is gearing up to host Sunday night’s American Music Awards. On Thursday, the Georgia-native took time out of her busy schedule to meet up with the 24-year-old rapper, Megan Thee Stallion, and the two had a twerk session.</p>
      <p>She wrote in the caption of the Instagram video, “linked up with my Melanin Queen @TheeStallion #Melanin Paahpin!” You can check out part of her post below:</p>

      <p>There were a number of famous people who commented on the two women dancing, including the Academy Award-winning actress, Lupita Nyong’o, who referred to them both as “show-offs.” Previously, Thee Stallion shut down rumors she was in a relationship with the baby daddy of Khloe Kardashian, Tristan Thompson.</p>
      <p>Reports hit the press earlier this week claiming that the 28-year-old basketball player invited her to come to watch the game between the Cleveland Cavaliers – whom he plays for – and the New York Knicks. The star said in response to the reports on her social media that she was there at the game along with her friends and manager.</p>
      <p>As it was noted above, Tristan Thompson is the father of Khloe Kardashian’s child, True Thompson, however, they broke up near the beginning of the year after it was revealed the basketball player had kissed Kylie Jenner’s best friend, Jordyn Woods, while at a party.</p>

      <p>In the year prior, Tristan was also busted hanging around other women at nightclubs, in pictures obtained by The Daily Mail. However, it was the second time he was caught messing around on Khloe that finally broke the camel’s back.</p>
      <p>Since then, multiple reports have suggested the NBA star has been trying to get back together with the mother of his child, however, Khloe reportedly wants nothing to do with him, at least in terms of a romantic relationship.</p>
      <p>According to Hollywood Life, just a few days before she and Ciara joined for the collaborative IG video, Megan stirred controversy for dancing with the 34-year-old, Trey Songz, while at a nightclub. On the 20th of November, the rapper tweeted, “I wish y’all would stop making s**t up.”</p>
