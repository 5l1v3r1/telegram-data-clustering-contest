      <h1>Talking About Oshiomhole A Waste Of Time – Ogun APC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">George Ogbolu</a></address>
      <p>The Chairman of the Ogun State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Derin Adebiyi, has said talking about the national chairman of the party, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/23/dino-melaye-will-lose-like-saraki-shehu-sani-others-oshiomhole/"><u><b>Adams Oshiomhole</b></u></a>, was a waste of time.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> recalls that the Derin Adebiyi-led APC executive in Ogun had in 2018 filed a suit to challenge its dissolution by Oshiomhole for alleged anti-party activities.</p>
      <p>Oshiomhole had replaced the elected executive, loyal to former Governor, Ibikunle Amosun, with a three-man caretaker committee led by Yemi Sanusi.</p>
      <p>However, the court has since ordered that status quo be maintained on the matter which is scheduled for hearing on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Daily Post on Saturday, Adebiyi, who is optimistic of victory at the court, wondered why Oshiomhole would continue to run the party the way he is currently doing.</p>
      <p>He said: <i>“I have said enough, two interviews, two letters and what have you. But talking about Oshiomhole is like wasting one’s time.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“I don’t know how somebody who says he’s the National Chairman will be running a political party like this.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It’s unbeneficial to anybody talking about Oshiomhole. That’s the truth.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Some state chairmen of the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/23/apc-chairmen-call-for-oshiomholes-resignation/"><u><b>APC</b></u></a> had called on Adams Oshiomhole to resign.</p>
      <p>They made the call at the National Caucus meeting of the party chaired by President <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/23/president-buhari-storms-out-of-apc-nec-meeting/"><u><b>Muhammadu Buhari</b></u></a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking to newsmen, the spokesperson of the aggrieved members and chairman of the Zamfara APC, Lawal Lawani said Oshiomhole should leave office, insisting that his leadership had divided the party.</p>
