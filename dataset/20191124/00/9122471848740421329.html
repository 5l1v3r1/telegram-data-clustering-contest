      <h1>LeBron James Loved Chase Young’s Performance vs. Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:33:16+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 00:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Chase Young made a huge statement in his return from suspension this afternoon. The Ohio State star and potential Heisman candidate had three sacks against Penn State, making a few huge plays down the stretch to help the Buckeyes wrest momentum away from the Nittany Lions late in the game. One of the most prominent Ohio State fans out there, Lakers star LeBron James, was watching.</p>
      <p>Defensive players rarely make the Heisman ceremony, but Young could buck that trend. It seems very unlikely that he’ll be able to jump Joe Burrow for the trophy itself, but Ohio State still have some huge games left for him to add to his impressive season.</p>
      <p>Young got <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-buckeyes/urban-meyer-ohio-state-penn-state-chase-young-heisman">plenty of love</a> after the game. No message is more impactful than the one he got from another Ohio legend, though, Buckeyes fan LeBron James.</p>
      <p>During the game, James tweeted about Young’s return to the field, saying “Welcome back MONSTER,” a fitting description of the defensive end’s play.</p>
      <p>The two had a cool exchange after the game as well.</p>

      <p>James was supportive of Young when the suspension news came down. That is no surprise, given his long-standing animosity toward the NCAA, and his Buckeye fandom.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the Los Angeles Lakers star does not have a Heisman vote, but Young has caught the eyes of numerous others this season. We’ll see how close he can get to Burrow, and whether he’ll land a coveted invite to New York for the ceremony.</p>
