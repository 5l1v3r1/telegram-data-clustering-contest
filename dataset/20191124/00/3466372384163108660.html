      <p>Interacting with a group of National Cadet Corps cadets during his "Mann ki Baat" radio programme, Modi also said that as an NCC cadet in his school days, he never got punished.</p>
      <p>Modi admitted that "due to Google", his reading habits have suffered as there is a shortcut available to find references.</p>
      <p>When one of the cadets asked him "had you not been a politician, what would you have been," Modi described it as a "difficult question".</p>
      <p>"Now this is a very difficult question because every child goes through multiple phases in life. Sometimes one wants to become this, sometimes one wants to become that, but it is true that I never had the desire to enter politics, nor I ever thought about it," he said.</p>
      <p>He said but now that he is a politician, "I keep thinking how I can work for the welfare of the country."</p>
      <p>The thought that had he not joined politics, what would he be doing never crosses his mind, Modi said.</p>
      <p>"Now, wherever I am, I should live life to the fullest and I should wholeheartedly work for my country ... I have now dedicated myself for this purpose only," he said.</p>
      <p>Responding to a question on whether he gets time to watch television and read books, he said he was always fond of reading.</p>
      <p>He had little interest in watching films and he watches very little TV.</p>
      <p>"I used to read books. But these days I am unable to read and due to Google, the habit of reading has deteriorated because if you want to seek a reference, then you immediately find a shortcut. As is the case with everyone, certain habits of mine have also been<br/>spoilt," he said.</p>
      <p>In response to a question on his NCC days, he said he was never punished "because I was in a way quite disciplined."</p>
      <p>He said once a misunderstanding had crept up when he climbed a tree at an NCC camp to save a bird entangled in a kite string.</p>
      <p>People first though he would be punished for indiscipline but his action later earned him praise, he recalled.</p>
      <p>During the programme, the PM also talked about the significance of Armed Forces Flag Day on December 7.</p>
      <p>Paying tributes to the valour of the armed forces, he appealed to the people to contribute towards the well-being of the welfare of the personnel of the armed forces.</p>
      <p>He said on the basis of feedback, the 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' programme will be held earlier, sometime in January.</p>
      <p>Last year students had complained that the programme was held just before examination, he said.</p>
