      <h1>Clowney inactive for Seattle against Eagles</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">The Associated Press</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/seattle-seahawks/">Seattle Seahawks</a> defensive end <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jadeveon-clowney/">Jadeveon Clowney</a> is inactive for Sunday’s game at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia/">Philadelphia</a> with a hip injury.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jadeveon-clowney/">Clowney</a> did not practice all week. He’s been the top performer for a defensive line group that had largely been underperforming until a win over San Francisco on Nov. 11. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jadeveon-clowney/">Clowney</a> had five tackles, five quarterback hits, one sack, one forced fumble - and one fumble recovery that he returned for a touchdown in that game.</p>
      <p>The former No. 1 overall draft pick has 21 tackles and three sacks in his first season with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/seattle-seahawks/">Seahawks</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jadeveon-clowney/">Clowney</a>’s career has been riddled with injuries and he has played all 16 games only once in his first five-plus years in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>.</p>
      <p>In Chicago, Mitchell Trubisky is active for the Bears after the quarterback left last weekend’s 17-7 loss to the Los Angeles Rams with a hip pointer. Trubisky was a full participant at practice all week.</p>

      <p>The New York Giants will be without tight ends Evan Engram and Rhett Ellison for their game against Chicago. Engram sprained his left foot Nov. 4 against Dallas. Ellison is out with a concussion.</p>
      <p>Matthew Stafford is missing his third consecutive game with back and hip injuries, and the Detroit Lions visit a Washington defense that is without lineman Daron Payne, who’s inactive with an ankle injury. Detroit tight end T.J. Hockenson, a late addition to the injury report Saturday, is active. Banged-up Redskins cornerback Josh Norman is active but is unlikely to start.</p>
      <p>In Cleveland, the Browns will be missing three starting defensive linemen for their game against the Dolphins. In addition to being without star Myles Garrett, suspended indefinitely for hitting Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph over the head with his helmet, and tackle Larry Ogunboji, suspended one game for shoving Rudolph, the Browns won’t have Olivier Vernon for the third straight game because of a sprained knee.</p>
      <p>Miami’s secondary will have an entirely new look. Safeties Reshad Jones and Bobby McCain were placed on injured reserve and cornerback Ken Webster won’t play because of an ankle injury.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Buffalo Bills rookie right tackle Cody Ford will start against Denver in place of Ty Nsekhe, who has a knee injury. Nsekhe and Ford have split time at the position this season. Nsekhe was hurt in a 37-20 win at Miami last week. Bills backup safety Siran Neal is also inactive a week after sustaining a concussion.</p>
        <p>For visiting Denver, starting receiver Tim Patrick is active after being listed as questionable on Friday due to a shoulder injury.</p>
        <p>The Oakland Raiders will be without nickel cornerback Lamarcus Joyner, who returned to practice Friday after injuring a hamstring against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 10. He sat out last week against Cincinnati. He did join the Raiders on their trip to face the New York Jets, but is sitting out that game.</p>
        <p>In New Orleans, Saints cornerback Marshon Lattimore is inactive with a hamstring injury. He is missing his second straight game. Carolina tackle Greg Little (knee) and guard Dennis Daley (groin) are active for that game after being listed as questionable on Friday.</p>
        <p>The Atlanta Falcons are without defensive end John Cominsky (ankle) but have defensive end Adrian Clayborn (groin) active for their home game against Tampa Bay. Brian Hill is starting for running back Devonta Freeman, who is missing his second straight game with a foot injury.</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay outside linebacker Carl Nassib is active after missing two games with a groin injury.</p>
        <p>In Cincinnati, the Pittsburgh Steelers are missing their top receiver, running back and center against the Bengals. Receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster is out with a concussion, running back James Conner has a shoulder injury, and center Maurkice Pouncey is serving a two-game suspension for punching and kicking Garrett in Pittsburgh’s game against Cleveland.</p>
