      <h1>Westpac faces APRA inquiry as Frydenberg warns heads could roll</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:42:27+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 00:42</time> by <a rel="author">David Crowe</a></address>
      <p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has put Westpac on notice to expect another investigation into its money-laundering controls after a furore over allegations it<a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53c8o.html"> breached the law 23 million times</a> and helped send cash to child traffickers and child pornographers.</p>
      <p>Mr Frydenberg said the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) would also launch an inquiry into the bank while the nation's money-laundering and terrorism finance regulator AUSTRAC takes the company to the Federal Court over the allegations.</p>

      <p>While AUSTRAC is seeking civil penalties against Westpac, Mr Frydenberg signalled further action under laws that could give rise to substantial fines and the disqualification of directors.</p>
      <p>“There must be accountability and that will obviously involve decisions that they take about the futures of senior management, as well as the board,” he said.</p>
      <p>“These are very serious issues, both in terms of the nature and the number of alleged breaches. We’re talking about 23 million alleged breaches of the anti-money laundering laws, we’re talking about the failure to adequately assess customers with links to child trafficking and child pornography.”</p>
      <p>Mr Frydenberg said APRA had the authority to punish companies, directors and executives where there had been a failure to perform their duties.</p>
      <p>He noted that the Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR) was legislated in 2018 and was not retrospective, while some of the alleged Westpac offences date back to 2013.</p>
      <p>“APRA is an independent agency like AUSTRAC and they will determine their own conclusions, but what I will say is that they are looking at it and obviously they have particular powers under that legislation that we introduced,” he said.</p>
      <p>Asked on ABC’s <i>Insiders</i> program what action he wanted to see, Mr Frydenberg said there was a lack of “trust and confidence” in the banking sector and noted that the Westpac annual general meeting was coming up on December 12.</p>

      <p>“These issues develop a momentum of their own … and no doubt there’ll be some very hard discussions between now and then,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Frydenberg also said he had spoken to Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer and chairman Lindsay Maxsted and “made very clear” the seriousness of the alleged breaches.</p>
      <p>“They also made very clear to me that they have a process now underway where they’re bringing independent experts in and they’re determined to provide a way forward. And, of course, this is before the courts,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Decisions about who are on boards are matters for shareholders and who are on executive teams are matters for boards.</p>
      <p>“That being said, these are very serious issues. There must be accountability.</p>
      <p>“AUSTRAC has been highly critical in their statement and now APRA is looking into it.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there is any doubt as to the seriousness of these issues and the government’s position.”</p>
      <p>Asked if jail sentences should be imposed on individual directors or executives, as recommended by former competition regulator Allan Fels, the Treasurer pointed to existing laws that could fine companies and disqualify directors.</p>
