      <p>CAIRO - 24 November 2019: The Ministry of Antiquities conducted scientific studies on three mummies discovered in the cache of El-Assassif in an attempt to unfold their secrets. <br/><br/>The preliminary results of the CT scan performed on the mummies of a man, a woman and a child indicated that they are all preserved in a great way and are in good condition. The mummies of both the adults did not contain any precious findings, unlike the mummy of the child that contained two golden pieces. <br/><br/>These studies will also be conducted on the rest of the mummies discovered in El-Assassif cache. The second phase of the studies will include DNA tests for each mummy, as to see if there is any relation between them.</p>
