      <h1>The Enduring Power Of The Fifty Shades Brand</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Franki Cookney</a></address>
      <p>From Fifty Shades lingerie, to makeup, wine and <a href="https://www.sheknows.com/parenting/articles/1045245/fifty-shades-of-grey-baby-products/">babygrows</a>, there seems to be nothing the erotic romance franchise won’t stick its name on. You can even buy a Christian Grey <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fifty-shades-grey-teddy-bear-770664">teddy bear</a>, which comes holding handcuffs and a mask. Some ideas were more successful than others. The “Flirty Shades of Surf” <a href="https://www.independent.ie/life/home-garden/how-dirty-is-your-laundry-surf-launch-fifty-shades-of-grey-inspired-detergent-30906619.html">laundry detergent</a>, was met largely with ridicule. The sex toys and adult accessories, however, were always destined to be a hit. Over 4 million units of The Fifty Shades of Grey sex toy range have been sold to date worldwide since the launch of the official collection in 2012. Eight years, five books, and three films later, they continue to “sell and sell,” according to Lovehoney, which designs and manufactures the collection, in collaboration with author E.L. James.</p>
      <p>The $87 Greedy Girl Rabbit vibrator, from the Fifty Shades range, is the store’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/frankicookney/2019/09/26/behind-the-scenes-at-the-uks-biggest-online-adult-retailer/#6faf23402786">best-selling toy</a> and is tipped to be one of their top Christmas sellers this year. Meanwhile, data provided by <a href="https://www.semrush.com/">Semrush</a> reveals that internet searches for “Fifty Shades of Grey sex toys” have largely remained consistent over the last five years. </p>

      <p>Lovehoney signed the contract to license the Fifty Shades of Grey range for sex toys and bondage accessories in the summer of 2012, and the first collection launched the following November. James liaised with designers and approved the collection, <a href="https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/offical-range-of-fifty-shades-sex-toys-sees-a-christmas-sales-boom-136565">commenting</a> that it was “what I always imagined while I was writing Fifty Shades of Grey.” When the range was first released in 2012, it sold out a third of its stock in under 24 hours. <a href="https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/offical-range-of-fifty-shades-sex-toys-sees-a-christmas-sales-boom-136565">At the time</a> the “Inner Goddess Silver Balls” were the most popular product. With every new film, new toys and accessories have been added. </p>
      <p>“The very first collection focused on products that were specifically featured in the books,” says Bonny Hall, product director at Lovehoney. “The product designs tried to stay true to scenes in the books and to give the customers product that would allow them to recreate scenes.” But over the years the team has branched out. “There is no rabbit [vibrator] in the trilogy of books, but when we suggested it to Erika, and we mentioned that as a sex toy shape it was our best selling line, she was excited to add it to the range,” says Hall.</p>
      <p>There are now 86 products in the <a href="https://www.lovehoney.co.uk/fifty-shades-of-grey/">current collection</a>. Prices range from $7.75 for a silicone ring to $154 for a five-piece “Greedy Girl Play Box.” The range continues to perform well, “growing year on year,” says Hall. So what is its secret?</p>
      <p>James self-published the first “Fifty Shades of Grey” erotic romance novel in 2011, before publishing rights were acquired by Vintage Books in 2012. It became the best-selling British book of all time. She went on to complete the triology with “Fifty Shades Darker” and “Fifty Shades Freed,” both of which were published in 2012. She later wrote two follow-up books, published in 2015 and 2017, which consisted of retellings of the same story from the character Christian’s point of view.</p>
      <p>The Fifty Shades film franchise <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2018/02/24/box-office-fifty-shades-freed-tops-300-million-pushing-fifty-shades-trilogy-to-1-25-billion/#2f934ceb150e">has made over</a> $1.25 billion worldwide on a combined production budget of $150 million. The popularity of both the books and films—despite being panned by critics—suggests that James tapped into something that had been missing from the adult market. Whether you love or hate her depictions of BDSM and kink (and there are plenty of legitimate criticisms to be made), the fact is, she made it marketable to the mainstream. “It was not just her tapping into something, she commercialized it,” Anne Jamison, an associate professor of English at the University of Utah, who studies fan fiction, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/books/el-james-the-mister-fifty-shades.html">told</a> the New York Times earlier this year. </p>
      <p>There’s no doubt the Fifty Shades branding has opened up a world of sex toys and kink accessories to people who might not otherwise have considered them. “The brand is a great way for people to identify with the products and to be given permission to explore and use them,” says Hall.</p>

      <p>When working with Lovehoney on the toys, one of James’ key requirements was to “make them pretty,” and it’s fair to say the range looks good. A muted colour scheme of black and purple with silver details and minimal design conveys the luxury of the Fifty Shades world and makes for a more “grown up” feel in a market often dominated by bright reds and pinks. </p>
      <p>It would have been easy to stop there. But in order to achieve its success, however, the brand had to do more than appeal to new customers and those curious about BDSM. It also had to win over experienced sex toy users as well as kink fans—many of whom were highly sceptical of the franchise.</p>
      <p>“I hate the Fifty Shades series, but I got sent some products from the collection to review, and I have to say they are quality items,” says Amy Norton, a British sex blogger who writes at <a href="https://coffeeandkink.me/">Coffee &amp; Kink</a>. “In my ideal world, I would rather people's first introduction to kink and sex positivity wasn't via Fifty Shades, but people who do come in that way still need and deserve quality toys. If they buy a safe product they'll actually enjoy because it has that particular branding, I'd rather they had that than a random jelly dong they pick up for a tenner.”</p>
      <p>Other customers I spoke to shared similar stories, of initially being embarrassed to buy something as “corny” as a Fifty Shades branded toy, but then being impressed with its quality. Even those who agreed they were drawn in by the name said they were pleased to discover the products lived up to the hype. </p>
      <p>In fact, you might say that the Fifty Shades brand has achieved success not just because of its name but in spite of it too.</p>
