      <p>Revolts are breaking out <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/all-the-protests-around-the-world-right-now">all over the world</a>. From Lebanon to Iraq to Hong Kong, populist uprisings are demanding the status quo change. People have had enough.</p>
      <p>So, what is the status quo and why are individuals waking up to its toxicity? Let’s consider the economy, the central facet of modern life.</p>
      <p>It’s important to understand how today’s top companies earn revenue. In spite of the maxim, “There is no such thing as a free lunch,” <a href="https://www.denis-oakley.com/2018/06/14/google-business-model-explained/">tech behemoths</a> sold the populace on the notion we could enjoy the internet’s spoils without paying the piper.</p>
      <p>“Facebook is free and always will be,” was Facebook’s slogan. Yet in recent years, books like Shoshana Zuboff’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Future-Frontier/dp/1610395697"><i>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</i></a> and movies such as <a href="https://www.thegreathack.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5PCjicX35QIVhPhkCh30SwOQEAAYASAAEgIU9PD_BwE"><i>The Great Hack</i></a> have shown this slogan’s hollowness. The internet is pay-for-play and always has been. Or as media theorist <a href="https://rushkoff.com/you-are-not-facebooks-customer/">Douglas Rushkoff</a> says: “On Facebook, we’re not the customers. We are the product.” </p>
      <p>But it’s not just Facebook commoditizing the web; it’s most every site you visit, whether it be Instagram, Amazon, or Google. Also, the public isn’t just the product, we’re customers, too. We’re all participating in a cleverly orchestrated, capitalistic symphony, shrink-wrapped in the feel-good rhetoric of something called “The Attention Economy.”</p>
      <p>Likes, clicks, smiley emojis, hashtags, emphases — whatever the symbol evidencing engagement — results from the same market logic. It goes like this: <i>The more time a prospect spends with a product, service, offering, idea, persona, or any other simulacrum of a brand, the better.</i> After all, an engaged prospect is one who might take action. They just might buy what’s being sold if their interest is held long enough.</p>
      <p>This insight is hardly new. The <a href="https://www.tintup.com/blog/history-evolution-advertising-marketing/">advertising-based</a> business model has served companies for nearly a century. Yet, the well-known cash-for-eyeballs approach is transforming into something more complex and insidious. In the past few years, the public has woken up to the realization that the technology behind social media was designed to be as addictive as slot machines. “Facebook, Twitter and other companies use methods similar to the gambling industry to keep users on their sites,” said Natasha Dow Schüll, author of <i>Addition by Design</i>, for an article in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/social-media-copies-gambling-methods-to-create-psychological-cravings"><i>The Guardian</i>.</a> “In the online economy, revenue is a function of continuous consumer attention — which is measured in clicks and time spent.”</p>
      <p>So, how is the Attention Economy going?</p>
      <p>Not so well. “People are openly revolting,” says Cindy Goss, founder and president of <a href="https://www.propelbusinesssolutions.com/">Propel Business Solutions, Inc</a>., a Southern California-based branding and marketing firm. “Across the web, professional service providers, consumer product manufacturers, distributors — even nonprofits — are courting their target audience’s attention in more competitive ways than ever before. But people are no longer listening.”</p>
      <p>An expert in the public persuasion space, Goss possesses more than two decades of experience working with marketing giants such as Anheuser-Busch and Ingram Micro, a Fortune 500 distributor of information technology products. So, we should listen to her when she says the public has hit a wall. “Companies must be careful of burnout,” she warns. “The ‘overwhelm factor.’ There can be too much of anything. Even a good thing.” </p>
      <p>The “good thing” in this case was once upon a time heralded by tech oracles such as Al Gore as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_superhighway">the information superhighway</a>.” Back then, pre-Y2K prognosticators painted a cheery picture, one in which people of all classes and divisions could digitally link up for mutual benefit. Two decades into the mass adoption of the internet, people are beginning to push back against this moment in time.</p>
      <p>Our era has been rightfully termed the “Information Age.”</p>
      <p>In the past few years big data has dethroned oil as the world’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data">most valuable commodity</a>. But so many bits and bits and bits come at a cost. As Goss suggests, people are rebelling due to overload. “There’s too much content in the Attention Economy for anyone to even make sense of it, much less use it to its full advantage,” she says. A study by the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/how-much-data-is-generated-each-day-cf4bddf29f/">World Economic Forum</a> puts her assertion in context. “By 2025, it’s estimated that 463 exabytes of data will be created each day globally — that’s the equivalent of 212,765,957 DVDs per day!”</p>
      <p>Necessity being invention’s mother suggests solutions to the rising content cacophony aren’t some utopian fantasy. Though the specter of bloodshed shows little sign of abatement as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMOieZKAB3k">tensions mount</a> in struggles for self-determination worldwide, cracks are becoming visible when it comes to transforming information overload. Both consumers and marketers are turning to AI to counter a digital advertising onslaught.</p>
      <p>Though big data has proven to be a tool for less-than-virtuous companies to profit from <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article/364152/how-companies-turn-your-data-into-money">data misappropriation</a>, it is also being commandeered to hyper-target messaging to intended recipients. Want your message to reach more people? Experts suggest using AI to determine something called “relevance at scale.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.marketingaiinstitute.com/blog/ai-in-advertising-what-you-need-to-know">Mike Kaput</a> of the Marketing Artificial Intelligence Institute says humans are adept at generating content to sell to others on a one-to-one capacity. “Chances are, we know enough about a coworker, friend, or family member to communicate with them in ways they respond to most effectively,” he writes. “We usually have at least some data on their behaviors, preferences, and desires.”</p>
      <p>According to Kaput, problems set in when marketers try crafting messaging that can appeal to a large group of people, each with their own individual tastes and values. “Humans don’t have the time, resources, or intellectual bandwidth to do this. But AI systems do.”</p>
      <p>To illustrate AI’s capabilities, first in determining a piece of content’s relevance to a specific individual, then acting upon such information, Kaput cites Phrasee, a business tool that can write well-branded, social media copy, as an example of using the technology for relevance at scale. “Their ad product recently reduced one client’s cost-per-lead by 31 percent.”</p>
      <p>Yes, such innovations might work like a dream. At least in theory. But perhaps we needn’t look to yet another technological solution for mindshare in the Attention Economy. Maybe the breakthroughs we need have more to do with a human/machine symbiosis than a cold algorithm.</p>
      <p>At least that’s Goss’ contention. “We keep hearing all the time that businesses need to post more content, share more content, like more content,” she says. “But what if that’s <i>not</i> true? What if the key to thriving in the Attention Economy involves a mixture of good old-fashioned human-to-human connection, aided by technology?”</p>
      <p>Goss’ solution isn’t just to return to a bygone era in which businesses hand-delivered paper brochures or cold-called prospects before the no-call list. Rather, she advises today’s companies, particularly service providers, to marry big data with old school outreach. “Our major and mid-sized clients do a lot of networking. I can’t tell you how many have said how beneficial it is to share a targeted piece of content, such as a relevant article or video for a prospect’s services, but real engagement is spurred in the follow-up with a face-to-face encounter.”</p>
      <p>AI can also play a role in this hybrid tactic. Returning to achieving relevance at scale, savvy companies <i>can</i> turn to algorithms to suggest what information would be most valuable to a prospect or customer, based on profiles developed by AI insights. But as Goss suggests, it would be a mistake to then “spam” these targets with depersonalized messages, posts, or emails that will never be opened.</p>
      <p>“Instead, integrate the technology with an authentic follow-up,” advises Goss. “In the age of autocorrect, consider writing your own email. Even better, do something dangerous. Pick up the phone and call the person you want to reach. The results might surprise you. You just might make a (profitable) <i>human</i> connection.”</p>
      <p>These suggestions might feel backward in the Information Age until we consider that life proceeds cyclically. Humans often rush to create a new technology, something promising to transform life, only to witness its downsides. This, in turn, causes backlash. We can see this with fast food. Once hailed as the future of cuisine for its convenience, the public eventually soured on it as books, like <i>Fast Food Nation</i> detailed its many <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fast-Food-Nation-Dark-All-American/dp/0547750331">negative health implications</a>.</p>
      <p>This past year, I cowrote a book about AI and how businesses can use this important tool. Yet, what my coauthor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neilsahota/">Neil Sahota</a> and I learned in writing it is that there can be technology overreach. People can become convinced AI will solve every issue a company faces. This is just not true. Even though we hear a lot of hype about how AI will completely transform the economy, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. After all the hysteria dies down, I think we will find a new cycle of thinking, one in which we celebrate the contributions of both humans <i>and </i>machines.</p>
      <p>When this occurs, it is my hope that a new revolution will take place. The most important revolt of all, it will be a change in consciousness suggesting every person’s life possesses meaning. Not just because of how much money they can bring us, but rather, others will be seen as valuable for existing at all.</p>
