      <p>The Mossad enlisted the aid of the son of Syria's former president to find the remains of famed spy Eli Cohen, New Zealand news site <i>Newshub</i> reported Sunday.</p>
      <p>Two years ago, the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service [NZSIS] and the Mossad contacted Khalid al-Hafidh, the son of Amin al-Hafiz, the man who was president of Syria when Eli Cohen was executed.</p>
      <p>Al-Hafidh moved to Auckland as a refugee from Syria.</p>
      <p>"I was cooperating with the New Zealand Secret Intelligence Service in a mission with the Mossad of Israel to help find - to try to find - the remains of the Israeli spy Eli Cohen," Khalid told <i>Newshub.</i></p>
      <p>"I did not want to do it for the money. I did not want to do it for Mossad. I wanted to do it for the wife and children of Eli Cohen," he stated.</p>
