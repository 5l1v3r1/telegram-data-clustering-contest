      <h1>Scott Frost Reacts To Nebraska’s Blowout Win vs. Maryland</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:29:53+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 00:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Nebraska’s bowl hopes were on the line against Maryland this afternoon. The Huskers needed a win to keep their eligibility alive heading into the regular season finale against Iowa.</p>
      <p>Scott Frost’s team delivered in a big way.</p>
      <p>Sure, it was just Maryland, but Nebraska was in desperate need of a blowout, comfortable win. It had been a while since the Huskers got one.</p>
      <p>Frost and Co. got just that in College Park, Md. today.</p>
      <p>Nebraska shellacked Maryland, 54-7, to improve to 5-6 on the season. Frost was encouraged with the result following the game.</p>
      <p>“It gives me great enthusiasm for things to come,” Frost told reporters.</p>

      <p>What would really give the Huskers reason for optimism is another win next weekend.</p>
      <p>Nebraska will look to upset Iowa on Friday afternoon. The Huskers would move to 6-6 win a win over the Hawkeyes and make a bowl game in Year 2 of the Frost era.</p>
      <p>Kickoff is set for 2:30 p.m. E.T. on BTN.</p>
