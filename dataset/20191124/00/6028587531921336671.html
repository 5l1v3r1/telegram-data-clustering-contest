      <p>Let me get this straight: NBA Commissioner Adam Silver wants to change the league’s 82-game schedule and introduce an in-season tournament along with a play-in format for the playoffs?Is he serious?</p>

      <p>Things have certainly changed since Silver took over for David Stern as the grand poobah of The Association. Revenues have skyrocketed, esteemed veterans have aged out, and there is a younger generation that can only be reached through their smartphones.</p>
      <p>Cable cords have been cut, sports gambling has become more normalized, and there is a buzz surrounding the league that is almost entirely based in the city of Los Angeles. (Philadelphia, you are the exception).</p>
      <p>But now Silver wants to get rid of the sacrosanct 82-game season and cut the number to 78 or 79 (<a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28145944/sources-nba-considering-reseeding-conference-finalists-postseason-play-in">no one can tell for sure from reading the ESPN story broken Saturday by Adrian Wojnarowski and Zach Lowe</a>), and some sort of a play-in tournament would be introduced for the playoffs for the 2011-2012 season.</p>
      <p>Hey, Adam: Ever hear of the expression “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it?”</p>

      <p>Silver seems to have some sort of fixation with European soccer, where in-season tournaments are the norm. His predecessor, Stern, had a fixation with FIBA basketball and wanted to institute the FIBA non-basket interference rules before his owners overruled him.</p>
      <p>Does it not occur to Silver that all NBA records are based upon 82-game seasons, and that lowering that number would sort of corrupt whatever accomplishments are achieved if/when the changes take effect?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28145944/sources-nba-considering-reseeding-conference-finalists-postseason-play-in">According to the ESPN story</a>, discussions are progressing with hopes of bringing a vote to the April meeting of the league's Board of Governors that would introduce some — if not all — of these proposals into the NBA's 75th anniversary season of 2021-22, league sources said.</p>
      <p>The reseeding of teams in the semifinal round based on regular-season record could give the NBA a championship series that includes its best two teams. The WNBA has been seeding teams in the playoffs without regard to conference for several seasons. Approval of the Players Association would still be needed.</p>

      <p>Back in the day, NBA teams played back-to-back-to-backs and traveled commercial. Team staffs included a coach, an assistant coach, a trainer and maybe a PR guy.</p>
      <p>Nowadays, some teams spend more on analytics people than they do on assistant coaches. General managers protect their turf by keeping headstrong coaches out of the league (anybody seen Jeff or Stan Van Gundy, Tom Thibodeau or Scott Skiles prowling a sideline lately)?</p>
      <p>Players who used to make millions are now making tens of millions, and they practically live in a bubble that is only periodically pieced by community service events and random encounters with the public, some of them documented by the likes of TMZ.</p>

      <p>It is understandable that Silver wants to leave his footprint on the league, but this idea is not Silver’s best.</p>
      <p>Again, there is too much going too well to upset the apple cart. James Harden is on a record-setting scoring pace. Luke Doncic is captivating audiences worldwide (except China, but that’s another story). LeBron James and Anthony Davis are tearing it up for the Lakers, and Paul George and Kawhi Leonard have just started playing together for the Clippers.</p>
      <p>The season is still young, and now we have this hairbrained scheme to do away with what has worked for the better part of 73 seasons?</p>
      <p>C’mon Adam. Find a better idea. Leave the 82-game schedule alone. If you want to change the playoffs, seed the teams 1 through 16 irrespective of conference, and let your fans have a mix of East vs. East, East vs. West and West vs. West.</p>
      <p>That is an easy fix, not an overthinking fix.</p>
