      <h1>Never Doubt The Power of Your Network!</h1>
      <h2>Encourage Meaningful Connections</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thriveglobal.com/authors/trish-tonaj/" target="_blank">Trish Tonaj</a></address>
      <p>We all have social media accounts where we share thought leadership and connect with a world wide audience.  </p>
      <p>As we expand and <a href="https://shareyourstories.online/">grow our business</a> we create a network of like-minded individuals who share our interests and contribute to the dialogue.</p>
      <p>The most powerful networks are those that not only share information but connect us with other individuals when we present an “Ask.”</p>
      <p>What is interesting to note, is which platform you find is most helpful with a response.  I have a colleague who relies on her network for not only business referrals but answers and recommendations for things like movies, books and social events.  </p>
      <p>Her network is extensive with many individuals she has never met and yet she is very passionate about the connections and  posts in her newsfeed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>It creates a feel good experience!</b>
      </p>
      <p>We all have heard many negative comments about social media and the time and effort we spend on-line connecting with our communities. If we take a look at the macro level, we will see an opportunity to convey a positive message that resonates with our networks for the greater good.</p>
      <p>I began to ask a number of my friends and colleagues how they expanded their global contacts to include so many individuals who share their common interests. </p>
      <p>Here are a few suggestions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Rinse and Repeat</b> – reach out to individuals where you share 25 or more common connections; ensure your bio is relevant and up-to-date. People will connect with you when they read your profile.</li>
        <li><b>Interests </b>– ask to join groups where you share a passion.</li>
        <li><b>Content – </b>everyone agrees that positive, uplifiting content will attract like-minded indivduals. What you post mst be authentic to you and your point of view. This will encourage other to reach out and begin a dialogue.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>As an entrepreneur, I have a passion for helping others amplify their success.  As a coach, my business is to assist others by increasing their visibility, encourage meaningful partnerships and contribute to their communities. </p>
      <p>Expanding our networks is part of the formula for success and encouraging meaningful connections is part of that equation. </p>
      <p>There is no doubt that meeting people face-to-face is very powerful and I think we all agree that that is still the ultimate connection.  We would never miss the opportunity to sit with someone, share experiences and start a conversation.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>It is the ultimate feel good experience!</b>
      </p>
      <p>When we view our connections through a different lens we will receive and share valuable information. </p>
      <p>I do not believe there is any merit in pursuing a large network for numbers sake but rather build a tribe that will encourage and support you through the power of the posts.</p>
      <p>The ask, presents another opportunity to engage followers so that we may get to know one another through the written word.  From time to time sharing a video is another powerful resource because it conveys a message through a different medium.  The people in our network have an opportunity to make a “human connection” through not only the visual but listening to our voice.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>It creates another feel good experience!</b>
      </p>
      <p>The words that we share and the videos that we post say a lot about who we are and building a following of like-minded individuals is a great way to receive referrals and recommendations.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Never doubt the power of your network…You may find that you area able to encourage meaningful connetions!</b>
