      <p>Ghana and Crystal Palace forward Jordan Ayew has been shortlisted among 30 players who have been nominated for the 2019 African Player of the year award.</p>
      <p>CAF announced the 30-man shortlist on Sunday morning with Ayew and Thomas Partey being the only Ghanaians making the cut.</p>
      <p>Ayew's nomination comes following an impressive start to the 2019/2020 Premier League season and an intriguing campaign in the year with the national team.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old has netted four goals in twelve games for the Eagles in the English top-flight this term.</p>
      <p>Ayew has gone ahead to win two player of the month awards at club level this season.</p>
      <p>The former Aston Villa, Olympique Marseille and Swansea City star was Ghana's main man at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations as he bagged two goals for the Black Stars.</p>
      <p>The 30-man list will be pruned down to three before the awards ceremony on Tuesday, 7 January 2020 at the Citadel Azure, Hurgada, Egypt.</p>
      <p>Egypt and Liverpool FC key man Mohamed Salah won the prestigious award last year in Dakar, Senegal.</p>
