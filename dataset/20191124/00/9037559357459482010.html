      <p>Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) President Shehbaz Sharif criticised US envoy Alice Wells' statement from the previous day, stating that her statement about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) showed her ignorance of the project. </p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter, Shehbaz said that his party rejected Wells' criticism and dubbed it 'ill-founded'. </p>
      <p>"As someone who was closely associated with negotiation process, I must say that CPEC envisions a community of shared interests," he tweeted. </p>
      <p>Shehbaz heaped praise on China by stating that Pakistan's 'Iron Brother' was an all-weather friend and ally. </p>
      <p>Wells had said that the lack of transparency in the CPEC projects would foster corruption and put more burden on Pakistan's economy. </p>

      <p>Speaking to media in Multan on Sunday, Qureshi said CPEC was a game changer for the region and there were no restriction for any country including US to invest in Economic Zones being established under it.</p>
