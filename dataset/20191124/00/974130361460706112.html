      <h1>'This Is What We Live For' - Brendan Maher Ends Monster Year With Munster Triumph</h1>

      <p>After ending their county title drought only a few weeks ago, Tipperary's Borrisoleigh have gone on to claim the provincial crown this afternoon. It is a remarkable success for a club that had gone 33 years without tasting success.</p>
      <p>1986 was the last time they had competed in a Munster final but there were no signs of any nerves in today's clash with defending champions Ballygunner. Having entered the game as major underdogs, they produced a cracking performance to come away with a one-point victory.</p>
      <p>It will mean all the more for a club that experienced <a href="https://www.balls.ie/gaa/brendan-maher-borris-ileigh-tipp-title-420493">some horrific tragedies </a>in recent times, with this win sure to lift spirits in the whole parish. Speaking after the game, it was clear what it all meant to Brendan Maher.</p>

      <blockquote>I've been hit left, right, and centre coming over there. It's unbelievable, it's a dream.<br/>We came in today at 4/1, nobody expected anything of us. To be honest, we were delighted with that...<br/>I think you can see it yourself there, it means everything. This is what we live for. Borrisoleigh is a proud place, we have a huge tradition of hurling and we're bringing it back.<br/>It's been a tough 15 months for everyone in the parish. I said it after the county final, this doesn't gloss over anything that has happened but it does give a little bit of positivity, a little bit of happiness and positivity to the people of Borrisoleigh. We will enjoy this one.</blockquote>
      <p>It has been an incredible year for Brendan Maher as he played a key role in Tipperary's All-Ireland win. He also earned an All-Star for his troubles.</p>
      <p>For a tight knit community such as Borrisoleigh, this is a momentous day. It is also yet another example of the power of the GAA to bring people together, allowing them to forget the woes of everyday life if only for a few hours.</p>
      <p>You can't beat the club championship.</p>
