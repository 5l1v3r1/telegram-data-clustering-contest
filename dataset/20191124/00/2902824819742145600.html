      <p>On December 6, Jungle Jam will host a party at <a href="https://mixmag.net/read/the-cause-new-home-news">The Cause</a> to raise funds for Centrepoint, a charity that supports homeless and vulnerable youth.</p>
      <p>The event responds to record numbers of homeless youth, with child homelessness having surged by 80% since 2010.</p>
      <p>The lineup boasts an array of drum 'n' bass, jungle, footwork, 160 and dancehall acts. <a href="https://mixmag.net/read/fracture-premieres">Fracture</a> (pictured) will play a back-to-back set with an unnamed <a href="https://mixmag.net/read/nastia-denis-sulta-saoirse-sherelle-bbcradio1-residency-news">BBC Radio 1</a> special guest, while Makoto and MC Conrad will drop an exclusive Good Looking set.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Other sets will come from Jamie Rodigan and <a href="https://mixmag.net/feature/10-of-the-greatest-rinse-fm-shows-of-all-time/">Uncle Dugs</a> (who will play back to back), <a href="https://mixmag.net/read/source-direct-mixmag-lab-ldn-dj-lab">Source Direct</a>, DJ Flight, Foul Play and many others.</p>
      <p>Red Bull has sponsored the event with FYI, a Leeds-based design and print company; the first 200 entrants will get free drinks.</p>
      <p>FYI's Director, and Jungle Jam promoter Thomas Buxey explains, “It’s devastating to see record levels of homelessness in our country, particularly among our youth. You don’t need to belong to the political left or right to see that these young men and women are the future of our country and deserve support through the hardest of times. We all have a part to play and I’m delighted that Jungle Jam is working with a legendary crop of artists to support Centrepoint’s tireless work.”</p>

      <p>Discussing the fundraiser, Fracture notes, “You only have to walk around London for a short while to realise we have a serious problem with homelessness at the moment. Come along and a check that amazing stacked line up and support a great charity in the process. I'm doing a special back to back with a special guest that's absolutely killing it at the moment, can't wait!”</p>
