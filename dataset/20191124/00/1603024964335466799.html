      <p>"During Kumbh Mela, Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, parliamentary election and various festivals, the police performed well. While the recent order of the Ayodhya case was a challenge, the police has tackled it very peacefuly," he said.</p>

      <p>On the occasion, Director General of Police Om Prakash Singh and ADG Rajeev Krishnan, the academy's director, addressed the probationers and spoke about the achievements of the department and the academy, respectively.</p>
      <p>Krishnan also explained about the new courses that have been added recently in the academy.</p>
