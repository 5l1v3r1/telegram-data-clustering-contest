      <p>There were just 11 minutes to spare and FC Barcelona were under the cosh.Granted they had equalised after Youseff En-Nesyri’s 12th minute top corner pearler, with Luis Suarez’s headed repsonse coming eight minutes after the interval, but still, they knew they would have been hung out to dry by the press and their fans alike if falling short of a way to overcome Leganes at Butarque on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Sergio Busquets receiving a yellow, and indeed banned for their next road trip to face Atletico Madrid at the Wanda on December 1, Ernesto Valverde saw it fit to make a tactical shift.</p>
      <p>Alongside Ivan Rakitic, Chilean war horse Arturo Vidal made his entrance in the 57th minute in place of the Spanish veteran and the struggling Antoine Griezmann to star alongside Frenkie de Jong in a three-man midfield.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman also made his exit not much less than a quarter of an hour later for Ansu Fati, yet it was neither the 17-year-old wonderkid of La Masia nor Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez that decided the outcome.</p>
      <p>A fox in the box, it was Vidal that capitalised on a melee in the penalty area from Ousmane Dembélé’s inswinging corner and smashed the Blaugrana’s second into the roof of the net to complete the 1-2 comeback.</p>
      <p>Despite an offside shout from the hosts, VAR revealed the last touch to have come off Ruben Perez, and the 32-year-old could continue celebrating his fourth goal of the season.</p>
      <p>‘Arturo VITAL’ ran the headline to this morning’s edition of Mundo Deportivo in response to his heroics, as once more the double-Copa America winner proved how essential he is to the cause. Over at SPORT, they called him a ‘lifesaver’ for the La Liga leaders.</p>
      <p>Awarded the King of the Match gong by the official sponsors, he was clearly in lifted spirits when speaking to Movistar moments after the final whistle and admitted that he was ‘happy’ with the three points and that he had scored.</p>
      <p>This is a marked improvement from just three weeks ago, when Vidal clearly stated: ‘I am not content. I am not happy’ at being on the outside looking in at Ernesto Valerde’s starting XI. But time and again on either side of the international breaks, he continues to work hard and seize his moments.</p>
      <p>First he changed the game off the bench against Inter, when Barça were trailing 0-1 at home to the Italians at the beginning of last month. Assisting one of Suarez’s two strikes and securing his side their first win on the continent in the Champions League’s Group F, he was rewarded with a starting nod in a 4-0 rout of Sevilla where he scored on the stroke of half time.</p>
      <p>Adding to his tally in the 5-1 home demolition of Valladolid and earlier in a similar 5-2 August destruction of Real Betis, he managed his first away from the Camp Nou at Leganes’ expense and has already surpassed his goal tally from his debut 2018/2019 season.</p>
      <p>As opposed to the 53 it took him to notch just three back then, it is 4 in 12 for ‘King’ Arturo this term and SPORT’s Josep Gonzalez thinks he has the answer as to why this has been achieved.</p>
      <p>‘The midfielder is sometimes playing in more advanced positions and with more freedom,’ noted Gonzalez, ‘something that is helping him to step into the area more regularly and to enhance one of his characteristics: his arrival from the second line, as he has shown both with Chile and at his previous clubs.’</p>
      <p>‘Arturo Vidal, a genius and a personality, and now, a lifesaver for Barça,’ finished Gonzalez of a player who, if following Rakitic to Italy in January, would be an immeasurable loss for the Catalans.</p>
