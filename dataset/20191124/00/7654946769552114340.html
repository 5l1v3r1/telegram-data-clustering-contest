      <h1>The Didi Gregorius fallout Yankees face in long list of decisions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:03:48+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 00:03</time> by <a rel="author">George A. King III</a></address>
      <p>Now that the Yankees and Jacoby Ellsbury have kicked off what should be a delicious and possibly extended battle <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/yankees-claiming-jacoby-ellsbury-went-behind-their-backs-in-grievance/">over the $26 million owed to the recently released outfielder</a>, there are other moving parts that require attention.</p>
      <p>And though outfielder Brett Gardner’s return remains likely, other key issues aren’t as clear.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/didi-gregorius-a-potential-piece-in-phillies-big-offseason-plans/">Free agent Didi Gregorius has been discussed by Phillies</a> decision-makers to replace Juan Segura at shortstop. Segura has three years and $43.75 million remaining on a five-year deal for $70 million he signed with the Mariners in 2017.</p>
      <p>Since the Yankees are high on catcher Kyle Higashioka to be Gary Sanchez’s backup, that means Austin Romine likely will be wearing a new uniform for the first time as a professional. Romine was drafted by the Yankees in the second round in 2007.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/mark-teixeira-what-itd-take-to-get-gerrit-cole-on-the-yankees/">As the Gerrit Cole saga unfolds</a>, the Yankees aren’t viewed among the early favorites to sign the 29-year-old free-agent right-hander, though that could change as November turns into December with January looming.</p>
      <p>Stephen Strasburg and Zack Wheeler are ranked second and third among free-agent starting pitchers. All three rejected their $17.8 million qualifying offer, which means the Yankees would lose their second- and fifth-highest draft picks and $1 million in the international pool bonus pool if they sign one of them.</p>

      <p>Could the Yankees use any of those three starters? Absolutely. Cole or Strasburg would automatically be the Yankees’ ace. Wheeler would be a No. 1 starter or slot in behind former ace Luis Severino, if Severino is healthy after 2019 was sabotaged by multiple injuries that limited him to three regular-season outings and two playoff appearances.</p>
      <p>Yet, filling the shortstop void that Gregorius’ departure would create is viewed in some circles as the Yankees’ biggest issue.</p>
      <p>This past week, a talent evaluator predicted Gregorius, who will turn 30 in February, would land a three-year contract after a 2019 season that didn’t begin until early June due to offseason Tommy John surgery. The left-handed hitter batted .238 with 16 homers, 61 RBIs and a .276 on-base percentage.</p>
      <p>The Yankees didn’t extend Gregorius the qualifying offer, so the team signing him won’t lose a draft pick.</p>
      <p>The Reds also have been linked to Gregorius, who started his big league career in Cincinnati. The Reds, however, have the switch-hitting Freddy Galvis at $5 million to play shortstop and likely would have to trade him to make a run at Gregorius, who earned $11.75 million last year.</p>
      <p>If Gregorius leaves, the Yankees would likely shift two-time All Star second baseman Gleyber Torres to short, where he started 73 games last season, though many believe he is better at second. Moving Torres would open up second base for DJ LeMahieu, return first base to Luke Voit and possibly create a competition between Gio Urshela and Miguel Andujar at third.</p>
      <p>As for Romine, who made $1.8 million last season, he is considered by some the best backup catcher in the game. Because Sanchez has been on the injured list four times in the past two years Romine has played 149 games, which is more than a usual backup. In those two seasons, Romine, who turned 31 this past Friday, hit .262 with 18 home runs and drove in 77 runs.</p>
      <p>With multiple teams searching for catching, Romine, an above-average defensive catcher pitchers enjoy working with and a good clubhouse presence, should have no trouble landing a raise and could ink a multi-year deal.</p>
