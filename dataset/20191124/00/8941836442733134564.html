      <p>WATERBURY, Vt. (AP) - The state of Vermont says it will resume 24-hour call center referrals for general human services, including for emergency housing eligibility, starting early next month.</p>
      <p>The state says VT 211 has not been able to staff its support line between the hours of 8 p.m. and 8. a.m. or on weekends and holidays as of Oct. 1.</p>

        <p>It says under the terms of a new agreement, the service will take calls 24 hours a day, seven days a week starting on Dec. 6. Officials say that’s made possible by additional staff and a contract with New England Call Center for coverage from the hours of 12 a.m. to 8 a.m., which is hard to staff.</p>
