      <h4>A plane reportedly carrying 19 passengers and crew has crashed into a suburb of Goma in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It was taking off on a flight to Beni, said regional authorities.</h4>
      <p>The operator of the twin-engine Dornier-228 aircraft, the <a href="http://busybeecongo.com/">local airline Busy Bee</a>, said the flight had on board 17 passengers and two crew members.</p>
      <p>The French news agency AFP, quoting Goma rescue coordinator Joseph Makundi, said 23 bodies had been pulled from wreckage.</p>
      <p>The crash site was among residential homes near Goma's international airport.</p>
      <p>The Congolese media outlet <i>actualite.cd</i> said the airline regularly ran medical evacuations in remote areas of eastern DRC.</p>
      <p>Fire tenders of Goma city and the UN peacekeeping mission MONUSCO were at the crash scene, said <i>actualite.cd.</i></p>
      <p>Sunday's flight was bound for Beni, 350 kilometers (220 miles) north of Goma.</p>
