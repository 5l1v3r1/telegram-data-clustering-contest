      <h1>Guinea-Bissau votes for president amid tension, unrest</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">LASSANA CASSAMA</a></address>
      <p>BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/guinea-bissau/">Guinea-Bissau</a> is holding a presidential election Sunday against a backdrop of political tension and unrest on the streets of the impoverished West African country.</p>
      <p>Twelve candidates are running for head of state, including the incumbent, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jose-mario-vaz/">Jose Mario Vaz</a>, who has been in power since 2014.</p>
      <p>He is the first democratically elected president to complete a full term in a country that has seen a number of coups and attempted coups. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jose-mario-vaz/">Vaz</a> is also running against two of the prime ministers he has fired during his five years in office.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/guinea-bissau/">Guinea-Bissau</a>, a former Portuguese colony of around 1.5 million people, is one of the world’s poorest countries. It has been plagued by political instability, poverty, corruption and drug-trafficking, especially cocaine. The most recent military coup was in 2012.</p>
      <p>The candidates’ agendas include promises to fight the cocaine smuggling that has used <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/guinea-bissau/">Guinea-Bissau</a> as a staging post between Latin America and Europe, prompting the United Nations to describe the country as a “narco state.”</p>

      <p>Candidates have also pledged to ensure political and governmental stability, create an effective public health and education system, and make a diplomatic push to restore the country’s international image.</p>
      <p>The nearly 800,000 registered voters are hoping Sunday’s ballot can foster change after years of political turmoil.</p>
      <p>If no candidate captures more than 50% of Sunday’s vote, a runoff ballot is to be held between the two top candidates on Dec. 29.</p>
      <p>Last month, one person died and three others were injured when police used tear gas to break up an unauthorized street march organized by opposition parties.</p>

        <p>Barely three weeks before the election, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jose-mario-vaz/">Vaz</a>, the incumbent, fired the prime minister, Aristides Gomes, and his Cabinet, elected last March, in a power struggle.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jose-mario-vaz/">Vaz</a> replaced Gomes with Faustino Fudut Imbali, but Gomes refused to leave office, saying the order to leave was invalid because <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jose-mario-vaz/">Vaz</a>’s term legally ended on June 23.</p>
        <p>The attempt to remove Gomes prompted an international outcry and appeals for stability from the United Nations, the European Union and the 15-nation Economic Community of West African States, with observers warning of a threat of civil war.</p>
        <p>The West African bloc, ECOWAS, called the move by the president illegal and threatened sanctions. Imbali then resigned.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jose-mario-vaz/">Vaz</a>’s strongest rival is former prime minister Domingos Simoes Pereira, who <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jose-mario-vaz/">Vaz</a> fired in 2015. That move led to years of tension between the head of state and parliament.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jose-mario-vaz/">Vaz</a> again refused to name Pereira as prime minister in June this year, after March legislative elections. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jose-mario-vaz/">Vaz</a> has vowed he will comply with the result of Sunday’s ballot.</p>
        <p>ECOWAS stationed 600 troops in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/guinea-bissau/">Guinea-Bissau</a> in 2012 to discourage armed uprisings. It wanted to increase the contingent to 2,000 this month for the election, but the country’s powerful military disallowed it.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/guinea-bissau/">Guinea-Bissau</a> became independent from Portugal in 1974, but it has struggled to get any momentum in its economic growth. Most people farm for a living.</p>
        <p>After the turn of the century, Latin American drug gangs used the country as a depot for the trafficking of cocaine into Europe by air and sea. The gangs became so influential that they unsettled local politics.</p>
        <p>The drug trade has become less obvious since international law enforcement bodies joined a crackdown and made large seizures.</p>
