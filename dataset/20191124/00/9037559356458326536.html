      <p>KARACHI: At least one person died and four others seriously injured as a dumper truck flipped over Sunday in an underpass near the metropolis' Drigh Road, rescue authorities confirmed.</p>

      <p>The deceased was identified as a two-year-old, rescue sources said, adding that a motorcycle had come under the dumper truck. The body, as well as the wounded people, were shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC).</p>
