        <i>Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on.</i>

        <i>Lady, you are the cruelest she alive</i>

      <p>
        <i>If you will lead these graces to the grave</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>And leave the world no copy.</i>

        <b>What sweet words that man bestowed on that lady, what lyrics, what prose, waxing eruditely. Clearly he's attracted to her and wants to get closer to her body and mind, telling her that she would be most cruel if she died with her beauty and left the world no copy. What's abundantly clear is that he's attracted by her physical beauty and he will stop at nothing to get her.</b>
      </p>
      <p>What is even more important is if she, in turn, is attracted to him, for there is no joy in unrequited attraction. “Me like she but she nuh like me.” His attraction to her is obvious <b>—</b> her beauty <b>—</b> but what does he have to attract her?</p>
      <p>Some cynics may say money, for Lord knows, we've seen some beautiful women cohabiting with some male trolls that make you wonder what those women saw in those men in the first place. Well, those trolls have treasure troves, are rich, so end of that story.</p>
      <p>But there must be other things apart from looks that make people attracted to each other. Hmm, how do I love thee, let me count the ways.</p>
      <p>Fake attractions or real? We'll find out right after these well understood responses to 'You just don't understand.'</p>

        <b>Hi Tony,</b>
      </p>
      <p>Some women always wonder why some men take so long on the toilet. They are in and out in five minutes, while we men may take 30 minutes to an hour with a book, newspaper or magazine. Plus, why do women always want to take their men to go shopping? For women, shopping seems natural as breathing and eating, and they will look at every item in the store other than what they are there to buy. Men find shopping to be a chore, boring and time wasting. Why don't women understand?</p>

        <b>Hi Tony,</b>
      </p>
      <p>You're darn right that women don't understand that men don't care if the house isn't dusted every half hour. They don't understand that men don't care what colours the curtains are, or if the bathroom mats don't match the shower curtain. Women don't understand that men would rather watch a good action movie or sports than <i>HGTV</i> or the <i>Lifetime</i> channel. Women don't understand that sex and love are two different things.</p>
      <p> </p>

      <p>The laws of attraction are vital to survival and continuation of most species. Male sees female and likes what he sees. Female sees male and likes what she sees, so wham bam and a union is formed. Nothing fake about that attraction as it's a pure and honest expression between two entities.</p>
      <p>Mankind however, is a different species, a breed apart, and we are often confused by what attracts one person to another. It's not simple at all. Far too often we'll see a beautiful woman out with a man who looks like a toad, and despite what the cynics say about her being attracted to his money, there are genuine cases of a real and true attraction.</p>
      <p>How can this be? Surely that must rank as a fake attraction, surely it must rank as pungent as a ram goat. The fact is, many women are not driven by an attraction to good looks as most men are, and will easily be attracted to a man who is not tall, dark or handsome as the cliché goes.</p>
      <p>Praise Jah for that too, for if that wasn't so, many ugly men would never get a beautiful woman. But how can this be, isn't that a fake attraction that defies logic and flies in the face of conventional wisdom? Remember that they say that God don't love ugly, so how can a beautiful woman, crafted by the Almighty, be attracted to an ugly man?</p>
      <p>But aha, God also has a sense of humour, and knows how to equalise and balance nature. Some women are attracted to power, real or imagined, and will be drawn to any man who exudes any form of power.</p>
      <p>She'll be attracted to an army officer, a top cop, a school principal, a karate instructor, a coach, a don, her boss, or anyone who exerts some sort of power. Is that a fake attraction or is it genuine? I say fake, for the attraction is not pure, but based on other factors with an ulterior motive.</p>
      <p>Most men do not share that form of attraction and are mainly drawn to beauty. Now, that's not fake at all, but follows the natural laws of nature. I do not know of any man who would be attracted to a woman who has an MBA or PhD, CEO of a company, but is as ugly as a mountain gorilla.</p>
      <p>I have seen men chase after models and beauty contestants, but never ever chase after an ugly academic. On the rare occasion that it does happen, it's always a cause for concern, raising eyebrows, asking questions and snide whispers. “What does he see in her, big strapping handsome man like that?” Clearly a fake attraction that defies logic. Now, before you chastise me, I did not make the rules about true or fake attractions.</p>
      <p>Past president of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe said, “If you are ugly, stop talking about inner beauty, because men don't walk around with X-Ray machines to see inner beauty.”</p>
      <p>See my point; men are attracted to outer beauty, which is a pure and true attraction. But that still does not explain why some are attracted to ugly women who have so-called inner beauty as people like to say.</p>
      <p>Not only would they need an X-Ray machine nowadays, but they also need a beauty detector machine to see what's true and what is fake. What you see in a woman now is not what you get, as many of them certainly aren't what they seem to be. They have taken fake attractions to a new level.</p>
      <p>She'll have a full lustrous head of hair, cascading over her shoulders, outdoing any lion's mane, her breasts are full, round, plump, her butt is shapely and cocked like a strutting mare's, worthy of being on a bike back wearing a B-rider, her lashes long and wavy like palm fronds, her eyes are pale green, even her calves are shaped like an athlete's.</p>
      <p>Most men would be attracted to that sort of beauty, but alas, the lass is fake. He'll be drawn to her, take her home, make love to her in the dark, until comes the light of morn and he's in for a rude and startling awakening.</p>
      <p>The green contact lenses are out, the weave or wig is off, the fake butt is off, the long sultry lashes are off, the stuffed breasts are off, the fake calves are off. He's so turned off.</p>
      <p>“Agh! Who are you, what have you done to the beautiful girl I took home last night?” Fake attractions lead to genuine disappointment as the fake stuff is laying on the bedroom floor.</p>
      <p>There are men who are deemed to have no looks, ugly as the proverbial sin, yet they always seem to attract the finest women. Aha, that's because women are also attracted to caring, sensitive, charming men who make them feel special. Nothing fake about that at all.</p>
      <p>“How come that man suh ugly but him always get quality women?”</p>
      <p>“Him can chat good and full of lyrics, that's why.”</p>
      <p>Attractions are strange, weird and often mind-boggling, sometimes turning heads when an apparent mismatch presents itself. But who are we to judge in the grand scheme of nature? Pretty people aren't always attracted to each other, neither are ugly people.</p>
      <p>Thank God for the latter statement, for I pity the children of two ugly persons, as that gene pool cycle will be almost impossible to break, and generations of ugly will be perpetuated for many years to follow. “Poor ting, his parents were ugly, as were their parents and others before them. He had no chance.” Yes he does. Go with the fake attractions rule and find a beautiful woman to break the cycle. Just make sure that he's rich though, so that he can fake attract her.</p>
      <p>But we must be kind. Next time you see a couple who doesn't fit into what you think is the ideal match, do not snicker and say to yourself, “That must be fake attractions.” They may be saying the same thing about you and your partner.</p>
      <p>More time.</p>

      <p><b>Footnote:</b> I always thought that schoolboys were supposed to be children. I could not believe my eyes while watching a daCosta Cup football match and seeing some of the boys on the Cornwall College team sporting not only moustaches but full grown thick beards. I had never seen that before. I'm not referring to slight whiskers or fuzz, but thick wooly beards. Do many schoolboys sport beards nowadays, is it a rural phenomenon, should beards be allowed in high school?</p>
      <p>Still on schoolboy football, it was so sad to see supporters of Camperdown behave so disgracefully, even stoning the KC team bus and mashing it up, after their loss to KC at Stadium East field. Is this what we're teaching our youngsters? What a shame.</p>
