      <h1>Rabbit numbers 'as bad as ever'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.odt.co.nz/author/yvonne.ohara%40alliedpress.co.nz" target="_blank">Yvonne O'Hara</a></address>
      <p>Central Otago rabbit populations have ‘‘exploded’’ thanks to good breeding conditions, lack of controls on reserves and a poor response to the introduced K5 virus farmers say.</p>
      <p>However, while places such as Lowburn are badly affected, Maniototo appears to have avoided the explosion.</p>
      <p>Matakanui Station owner Andrew Paterson said a mild winter had encouraged a population boom for rabbits.</p>
      <p>‘‘I think it is bordering on an explosion and they are as bad as I have seen them,’’ Mr Paterson said.</p>
      <p>‘‘The K5 virus [introduced last year] has had no effect, certainly not on my place, and it was released on my place.’’</p>
      <p>Federated Farmers member and sheep and beef farmer Phill Hunt, of Wanaka, said the rabbit population was bad, particularly on public spaces, reserves and walking tracks.</p>
      <p>‘‘It is quite noticeable, and even when driving past Doc Wanaka headquarters, there seems to be a lot of rabbits on their lawn,’’ Mr Hunt said.</p>
      <p>He carried out significant control work on his land, as did his neighbours, he said.</p>
      <p>'‘It seems to be public spaces are the issue.</p>
      <p>Farmers did not feel like doing much control work on their land if it was going to be reinfected.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Maniototo Pest Management manager Ossie Brown said rabbit numbers in the Maniototo were ‘‘very good’’ at the moment.</p>

      <p>The company is owned by shareholder farmers who paid on a per-hectare basis for pest control, and responsible for about 250,000ha.</p>
      <p>‘‘As far as I am concerned the K5 virus never worked in the Maniototo,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘‘I have not observed any impact and not seen any dead rabbit as a result.’’</p>
      <p>He said he had two staff out shooting most nights and they would average 20 rabbits each, which was low.</p>
      <p>The regular night shooting was followed up by helicopter shooting, and both systems had similar costs per hectare.</p>
      <p>Farmer Raymond Gunn, of Coal Creek, said rabbit numbers were ‘‘as many as we ever had’’.</p>
      <p>He said he carried out night shooting to control numbers but the rabbits came from waste areas, roadsides and riverbanks.</p>
      <p>‘‘In the days of the rabbit board, we all paid rabbit board rates and the board managed all those areas.</p>
      <p>‘‘Now it is a user-pays system and we deal with them.’’</p>
      <p>He said wasteland owners did not appear to be worried about the rabbits on their land.</p>
      <p>While he supported the reintroduction of a rabbit board system, or a co­operative similar to the MPM, he did not think it would work in the Teviot Valley.</p>
      <p>‘‘I think it works well when there is vast areas of farmland and no waste country.</p>
      <p>‘‘We have got lots of small lifestyle block holdings, about 10 large farms, lots of small holdings, riverbanks and council land.’’</p>
      <p>Mr Gunn said when the original calicivirus came through his property in the 1990s, it was extremely effective.</p>
      <p>‘‘It came to a naive population, which had never experienced it before and went through like wildfire.’’</p>
      <p>Now he thinks there may have been some sort of immunity in the populations which impacted the effectiveness of the K5 virus.</p>
      <p>Otago Regional CouncilDunstan councillor and farmer Gary Kelliher, of Springvale, said he agreed rabbit numbers had ‘‘exploded’’ throughout the region.</p>
      <p>‘‘Our farm was a release site for the K5 virus, but I saw no difference in numbers.</p>
      <p>‘‘It has been a failure.’’</p>
      <p>But Mr Kelliher said he ‘‘took his hat off’’ to the ORC staff who worked incredibly hard on the virus.</p>
      <p>He intends to raise the issue at the next regional council meeting and to explore the possibility of using genetics, or developing a rabbit contraceptive to provide another tool for rabbit control.</p>
