        <b>One of Asus' newest flagship laptops is hundreds of dollars off this week to be one of the better gaming deals you can find before Black Friday. The narrow bezels make the 17.3-inch chassis smaller than it really is.</b>

      <p>Sales are becoming increasingly more lucrative now that we're just days away from Black Friday. The latest deal involves the 17.3-inch Asus ROG Strix III gaming laptop for just $900 at Best Buy. This sale is particularly notable because the Strix III is a higher-end Asus gaming laptop unlike the lesser budget TUF series. In fact, the Strix III is barely a year old meaning that Best Buy isn't just running the sale to clear stock of older or already outdated laptops.</p>
      <p>The $900 asking price will net you the latest generation Intel 9th gen <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Core-i7-9750H-Processor-Benchmarks-and-Specs.416733.0.html">Core i7-9750H</a> CPU, <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-1660-Ti-Laptop-Graphics-Card.386426.0.html">GeForce GTX 1660 Ti</a> Turing GPU, 16 GB of RAM, and a roomy 512 GB SSD. When considering that this exact configuration launched for about $1400 USD earlier in the year, the deal is quite the bargain.</p>
      <p>As noted in <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-Strix-Hero-III-G731GV-RTX-2060-Laptop-Review-Not-that-Much-Better-than-the-G731GU-GTX-1660-Ti.433037.0.html">our full review</a> of the Strix III, however, the system offers no Thunderbolt 3 ports and it can get quite loud even for a gaming laptop. There is also no webcam meaning that you'll have to provide your own external USB solution for video chatting. Nonetheless, chassis rigidity is excellent especially for a narrow-bezel design. If you're in the market for an affordable but powerful 17.3-inch gaming laptop, then the Asus ROG Strix III G731GU should be near the top of your list this Thanksgiving.</p>
