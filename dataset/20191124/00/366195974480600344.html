Featuring <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/g-eazy/profile">G-Eazy</a> the steamy new track finds the two addressing a forbidden love straight on, throwing caution to the wind in their choice words.</p>
      <p>"[G-Eaz] had an out of pocket verse. Lyrically, I feel like he's pretty raunchy a lot," Tinashe admitted to Billboard of the collaboration. "I was like, 'Whoa.' I was actually there when he recorded his verse, which is unusual. He was writing his verse and goes in the booth and saying his verse and looking at me while he's saying it. I was looking at my friend like, 'Can you believe this?' I felt like that energy was real and tangible so we had to use it. I've known G-Eazy for a long time. "</p>
