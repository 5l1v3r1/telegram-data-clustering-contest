      <p>It was a $768 million mistake.</p>
      <p>A day after an ill-fated demonstration of his <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/elon-musk-unveils-cybertruck-at-tesla-event-but-bulletproof-window-test-is-a-bust/">futuristic Cybertruck</a> — a pickup that was supposed to be indestructible — Tesla CEO and founder Elon Musk’s net worth faced a massive drop.</p>
      <p>Tesla stock skidded 6% hours after the tech billionaire unveiled the Cybertruck at the SpaceX headquarters last week. The vehicle, which was billed as being able to withstand a bullet from a 9mm gun, sustained damage after a designer lobbed metal balls at the windows. The stock market plunge resulted in a loss of $768 million for the billionaire.</p>
      <p>“Oh my f–king God,” said Musk after his head designer threw a metal ball at the driver’s side window, causing a an impact that left a crater in the vehicle and caused the armored glass to crack. When the designer tried again, lobbing the metal ball at another window, more damage ensued.</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck will retail for just under $40,000, and production is scheduled to begin in 2021.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Musk tweeted there were orders for 146,000 Cybertrucks, adding in a second tweet that the interest in the vehicle came without any advertising and no paid endorsements.</p>
