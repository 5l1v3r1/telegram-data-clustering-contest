      <h1>How To Run A 100% Remote Workplace</h1>

      <p>Tortuga creates simple, sophisticated yet high-performance luggage for urban travelers with a team that’s 100% remote and constantly on the move. The company’s cofounder and CEO, Fred Perrotta, started the business nine years ago with his childhood best friend, Jeremy Michael Cohen. Inspired by <i>The 4-Hour Workweek</i>, the two were intent upon building a company that could earn them passive income. But soon they found their true purpose in creating a company that allows all its employees to work remotely.</p>

      <p>“Beyond making travel easier, I found a second level of meaning with Tortuga: creating a better way to work, and sharing our vision for how companies can make remote workplaces work for them,” says Perrotta. “We must change the way we work. Today, companies are too focused on hierarchy. Instead, they must be built around their people.”</p>
      <p>According to Perrotta, the industrial era mindset has influenced office work as much as factory work. The top down, command-and-control structure is not the best way to run a team, particularly a team of knowledge workers. Unfortunately, open offices look great and <i>seem to </i>foster collaboration. However, they’re a terrible environment for getting work done. The offices are loud and invite constant interruption. “You cannot do deep, focused work in this environment,” Perrotta exclaims. “It is insane. You can’t do your work at work. Instead, you’re attending some meetings and doing the performative aspect of work: sitting at your desk for eight hours.”</p>
      <p>Tortuga has built its work environment around how people work best, allowing individual contributors time and space to do deep, focused work with minimal distractions. Meetings are scheduled at the beginning of the day, end of the day, or at a natural stopping point after a block of work. The company has designed its communication systems intentionally – because otherwise, no one talks. Tortuga uses Asana as their “system of record” for project management and Slack as their “watercooler.” Perrotta explains that “chat conversations are sometimes work related. But much of the conversation on Slack is just talking as you would in an office. We share links, music, books, and articles there.”</p>
      <p>Most of Tortuga’s team did not have experience working remotely when they were hired. Perrotta found that he and his cofounder had to learn how to separate out candidates who <i>might </i>work well remotely from those who just liked the idea of it. <b>“</b>The biggest signal we look for is a history of self-starting,” he says. “Examples could be leading an initiative at a previous job, freelancing or having a side hustle, or starting a meetup or mastermind group. When you work remotely, no one is looking over your shoulder making sure you’re getting your work done. You have to have the intrinsic motivation to be productive.”</p>

      <p>Perrotta says he stumbled into his life purpose. While he’d always dreamed of seeing the world, he didn’t travel outside of North America until he was 24. On that trip, he and his cofounder backpacked through Europe for two weeks, and ended up inspired to start Tortuga. Now, everything about what he does is aligned with his purpose.</p>
      <p>“I’m passionate about Tortuga’s mission of making travel easier and more enjoyable,” Perrotta says. “And now that we’ve grown to 11 people, I spend more of my time supporting the team, shaping our work practices and tools, and sharing what we’ve learned with other businesses. Just like other remote companies such as Basecamp and Buffer inspired us, we hope to do the same for the next generation of thoughtful business owners.”</p>
      <p>To others looking to align their career with their life purpose, Perrotta says, “Life is a journey and a continual learning process. My advice is to try a bit of everything until you find those passions that you want to pursue regardless of anything else. Find the challenges that you actually want to solve and aren’t just slogging through. Look for ways to combine multiple interests in new and unique ways.”</p>
