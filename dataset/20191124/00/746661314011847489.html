      <p><b>ISLAMABAD</b>: Federal Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Friday shared an unusual take on inflation, leaving many surprised, as he said it has benefited Pakistan’s farmers.</p>
      <p>Gandapur’s bizarre stance on inflation left Twitterati in splits with many questioning the minister for this unusual statement.</p>
      <p>The minister further stressed that it was common for prices to oscillate, but it was only the people who would eventually benefit. “Millions of farmers, our brothers, were affected when potato prices fell,” he noted.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Pakistan PM’s finance adviser, Abdul Hafeez Sheikh, claimed that tomatoes were being sold at Rs 17/kg, causing a huge uproar on the social media platform.</p>
      <p>Known for his controversial statements, in an earlier interview, Gandapur had stated that if India-Pakistan goes to war then Pakistan should use missiles against all those nations who decide to support India.</p>
