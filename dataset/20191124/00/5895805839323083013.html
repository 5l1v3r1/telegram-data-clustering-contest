      <h1>Dynamics of Disorder: How People (and Politics) Deteriorate</h1>
      <h2>Clients (and cultures) are often quite attached to their symptoms.</h2>

        <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy">Insight Therapy</a>
      </p>
      <p>One important goal in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy">therapy</a>, and a common precondition for success, involves helping clients revise their view of their disorder. On the face of it, one may assume that people who seek treatment for mental health issues—<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/shyness">social anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/ocd">OCD</a>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/addiction">addiction</a>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/eating-disorders">eating disorder</a>, etc.—would be eager to get rid of their symptoms, and would readily recognize their disorder as the source of their troubles. But this is not usually the case.</p>
      <p>In fact, clients are often quite attached to their symptoms, and identify with the ‘voice’ of their disorder. This is because the symptomatic thoughts and behaviors of a disorder, when they first appear, never present themselves as problems, but rather as solutions. They derive their power from insinuating themselves into the client’s world and sense of self posing as protectors, defenders, or allies, thus eliciting loyalty. The 'voice' of the disorder in the client's head is always pointing to some grave threat from which protection is required.</p>
      <p>For example, people who deal with social <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxiety</a> believe strongly that their anxiety is their protector—from judgment, from ridicule and rejection. People with OCD believe that their compulsive cleaning or checking behaviors, and the energy they put into monitoring potential sources of risk and contamination, are protective, saving them from harm, or at least from the grave discomfort of feeling unsafe. Addicts experience using as remedy, as cure, as relief from trouble and chaos; it takes away pain, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stress</a>, and angst. People with anorexia see their constricted eating as a solution, a protection against weight gain, a victory over chaos and lack of control, and a demonstration of strength. Etc.</p>
      <p>This process is enabled by the fact that the symptoms of many disorders offer immediate relief from psychological pain. They appear to be working for you, in the short term, and their true destructive dynamics surface only later, when you find that you are actually working for them. By that time, your emotional <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attachment">attachment</a> to--and identification with--the symptoms, and the entrenched related habits, override the influence of mere reason and evidence of their damaging toll.</p>
      <p>Much of the work of therapy therefore must focus on raising awareness regarding this misguided person-problem alliance and then refuting the assumptions that underlie it and changing the behaviors and relationships that sustain it.</p>
      <p>This is difficult to do. The alignment between person and problem, often formed over many years of living with the disorder, is not easily broken, even as the true destructive consequences become manifest. For one, it’s difficult for us to break old habits, attachments, and affiliations even after we realize their ultimate destructiveness. Think of toxic family members. Think of that <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/child-development">childhood</a> hero later revealed to have been a secret menace. Think of admired historical figures, or narratives, later found to have been untrue and unjust. Think of plastics. Think of sugar. It’s hard to let go.</p>
      <p>Another obstacle to change is the sunk-cost problem. People who have spent much time, resources, or energy working on a doomed project, or propping up a distorted worldview, or toiling inside a self-defeating frame of mind are not eager to change, because the change raises uncomfortable questions such as, ‘what took me so long?’ These kinds of questions may injure <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-esteem">self-esteem</a> and stir up painful <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/embarrassment">shame</a> or self-recrimination.</p>
      <p>Change also comes with inevitable doubt and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear">fear</a> of the unknown—the ‘devil you know’ problem. It is difficult also because it inevitably comes with growing pains and learning curves—the discomfort, awkwardness, and effort that attend doing something new and different. If change is to occur, old habits, relationships and beliefs will need to be changed, reshaped, or altogether abandoned, and new ones will have to be embraced: Shunning social interaction doesn’t protect you from isolation; rather, it leads to it. Avoidance is not a solution but the problem. Cleaning compulsively is more ruinous than germs. Your drinking buddies are not your friends, but your enablers. The bar is not your home; it’s your prison. Your self-starving is not a manifestation of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-control">self-control</a>, but an assault on the self. Etc.</p>
      <p>Another factor complicating the change process is the fact that health and illness possess similar weaponry. Disease processes are just as robust, complex, and resourceful as healing processes. The anxiety voice whispering in the client’s ear that the germs on the toilet are dangerous and destructive, that the price of ignoring them is too high, the pain of it intolerable, the ritual remedy so effective and readily available, and the relief of using it so immediate—that voice is difficult to dismiss or ignore. It uses the vocabulary of reason to perpetuate unreason.</p>
      <p>It’s difficult to reflect on this cunning, dangerous, and trenchant mechanism of disorder without seeing a timely analogy in the life of our body politic. With societies as with individuals, a disease process may insinuate itself into the system by presenting itself as an ally, a solution, the protector and savior, while pointing a finger at other, external forces as enemies and threats.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/president-donald-trump">President Trump</a> in this analogy embodies the voice of disorder: seductive, incessant, disorienting, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/deception">lying</a>, and ultimately destructive. He’s infiltrated the social mind, and the cultural habits of the body politic, by claiming to be the remedy and by pointing at myriad supposed 'real' foes—the deep state, immigrants, minorities, liberals, powerful women, etc.—as mortal existential threats from which only loyalty to him can protect us.</p>
      <p>In therapy, people rarely get better without a shift in loyalties, the recognition that the force with which they have identified, for which they have been working, whose words they have believed, and whose power they’ve fed—their presumed savior and protector—is in fact their nemesis. In <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/politics">politics</a>, as in therapy, such change does not happen easily, or without cost.</p>
