      <p>A remarkable fourth-quarter comeback had Canisius within one point of Cardinal Hayes with a big decision looming on the final play of regulation and the state Catholic football title on the line.</p>
      <p>Senior leader CJ Ozolins made that difficult decision much easier for Canisius coach Rich Robbins.</p>
      <p>After sophomore quarterback Tyler Baker led the team’s second touchdown drive in the final nine minutes – this one capped by a 13-yard catch in the end zone from classmate Nik McMillan with time running out – Ozolins came to Robbins to say that he believed he could find the end zone on a two-point play if given the chance.</p>
      <p>Robbins’ faith in Ozolins paid off as the standout linebacker and fullback took the ball – which was already moved halfway to the goal line after a Cardinal Hayes penalty – and forced his way into the end zone to give the Crusaders a 25-24 win Saturday at Stransky Field in West Seneca.</p>
      <p>It was the third New York State Catholic Athletic Association title for Canisius (7-5) and second over Cardinal Hayes since the state Catholic title game between the downstate New York Catholic High School Football League champion and Monsignor Martin Association began in 2014.</p>
      <p>“When we got the half the distance to the goal line penalty, that certainly made the decision easier for me, and when your senior captain runs up to you, grabs you by your coat and says, ‘Give me the ball; I will get in,’ I had to give it to CJ,” Robbins said. “And he got in. What a great moment.”</p>

      <p>Ozolins said Cardinal Hayes (7-5) saw the play coming and a linebacker blitzed into the gap where he was headed, but he got low and received a push from a few teammates as he drove forward.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to go for the win right there and I told Coach that I believe in myself and my O-line to get a push for me and I’ll get in the end zone to win this game for us,” Ozolins said. “I wasn’t going down until I crossed that line.”</p>
      <p>The loss soured a 212-yard performance from senior running back Jalen Smith, whose 57-yard touchdown with 9:08 left in the game seemingly put Cardinal Hayes in command at 24-10. Smith was averaging 11 yards per carry coming into the game, despite missing several contests this season with a torn ligament in his foot and continuing to play through the lingering effects of the injury, according to Cardinal Hayes coach CJ O’Neil. Cardinal Hayes failed on a third consecutive two-point attempt, after missing an extra point earlier in the game.</p>
      <p>“Canisius is a tremendous program and they obviously play championship-caliber football and they went out and won a championship today,” said O’Neil, who also headed the team when it lost 50-44 to Canisius in this same game three years ago. “It’s a testament to the coach and his kids being prepared to play in those moments.”</p>
      <p>With Canisius trailing by 14 points, Baker, who finished 22 of 35 for 213 yards passing, led a nine-play drive, which included a 29-yard pass to junior Riley Simpson on fourth-and-9 from the Cardinal Hayes’ 39. Simpson finished with a team-leading 81 yards receiving on five catches.</p>
      <p>Junior Joe Dixon, who ran for three touchdowns in Canisius’ upset win over St. Francis to win a Monsignor Martin title last weekend, capped the drive with an 8-yard touchdown. He finished Saturday with 31 yards on 11 carries as he dealt with a few second-half injuries.</p>
      <p>After a defensive stop, Canisius got the ball back on its own 15 with 1:58 left in the game and Baker once again went to work. He completed 9 of 13 passes on the drive, including lofting up a 13-yard touchdown to the double-covered McMillan in the left corner of the end zone on fourth down with the final seconds ticking off the clock.</p>
      <p>“I was in the end zone and I saw the ball up in the air and knew I had to go get it for my team – for the seniors, everyone who wanted this,” McMillan said. “[The corner] was playing inside me and I knew I had to get by him one way or another, so I did what I could, saw the ball up there and went to get it.”</p>
      <p>Baker said everything was clicking on that final drive – from the routes that were being run to the play calling. He added coaches reminded players that this team has overcome adversity all season, including an 0-3 start, so why not one more time?</p>
      <p>“I believed in my guys and they believed in me. Nik made an amazing catch. He’s an incredible player,” Baker said. “Our receivers were making some spectacular catches in traffic.”</p>
      <p>Cardinal Hayes was averaging 44 points per game, so while it was far from a perfect defensive performance, Robbins said he was happy with the effort.</p>
      <p>“To hold Hayes to 24 is pretty good,” Robbins said. “We had some defensive issues and that long run to put them up 24-10 could have been a back-breaker, but when we needed some big stops at the end, we got them.”</p>
      <p>After a scoreless first quarter, the Crusaders struck first on a Baker 34-yard touchdown run with just more than seven minutes to play until half, but Cardinal Hayes quickly struck back two minutes later when Smith scored on an 8-yard run – the first of his two touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Cardinal Hayes recovered consecutive squib kickoffs, giving them a short field for drives ending with senior Tafari Blackstock touchdown runs. Blackstock scored from 19 yards out with about three minutes left in the second quarter and from 12 yards with 1:27 before halftime putting Cardinal Hayes up 18-7.</p>
      <p>“That was a big momentum swing that put them up two scores at half, so I just told the kids that if we clean up that stuff and keep fighting for 48 minutes, good things will happen,” Robbins said. “And, boy, it took all 48 minutes.”</p>
      <p>The only points in the third quarter came from Canisius junior Wisken Whited on a 28-yard field goal to cut Cardinal Hayes’ lead to 18-10.</p>
      <p>Cardinal Hayes sacked Baker seven times, including three for junior defensive lineman Shawn Ward. Senior Damon Barnes also notched an interception.</p>
      <p>For Canisius, sophomore Donovan Davenport recorded an interception and Dixon and Ozolins each recovered a fumble.</p>
      <p>“It’s great to send the seniors out with a state championship – that was the total goal, but as all of these juniors and sophomore are hugging me after the game, they’re already talking next year, next year,” Robbins said.</p>
