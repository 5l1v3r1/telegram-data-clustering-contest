      <p>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kofi-cockburn/">Kofi Cockburn</a> and Ayo Dosunmu scored 20 points apiece and Illinois beat Hampton 120-71 on Saturday night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kofi-cockburn/">Cockburn</a> also grabbed 13 rebounds and is the only freshman in the country with five double-doubles through six games.</p>
      <p>“We came out and played the way we are supposed to,” Dosunmu said. “We’re getting better and better, collectively.”</p>
      <p>Alan Griffin and Andres Feliz each added 19 points for Illinois (5-1). Giorgi Bezhanishvili scored 14 points.</p>
      <p>“My teammates got me going. They told me to keep shooting, so I did,” Griffin said. The sophomore averages 6.4 points per game but leads the team with nine 3-pointers through six games.</p>

      <p>Jermaine Marrow led Hampton (3-2) with 22 points. Benjamin Stanley added 20 for the Pirates.</p>
      <p>Illinois took the lead at the outset on two <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kofi-cockburn/">Cockburn</a> free throws followed by his massive dunk after a Pirates turnover.</p>
      <p>Illinois had no turnovers at the half and led 62-31. The Illini finished with nine turnovers to the Pirates 16.</p>
      <p>“It was really nice to have a half of not turning the ball over,” Illinois coach Brad Underwood said. “We also had 16 assists. I’m proud of what the guys accomplished tonight.”</p>

        <p>HOT SHOTS</p>
        <p>Illinois’ 120 points were its most since scoring 121 against Chicago State in December 1993. Illinois shot 45 of 70 from the field for 64%, its best shooting percentage since 2011. “We were dialed in tonight,” Underwood said.</p>
        <p>“This is nowhere near our best,” Dosunmu said. “I think the other teams in the country should be scared.”</p>
        <p>Hampton was 28 of 64 (38%) from the field.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>Hampton: It was a learning experience for a Hampton team that isn’t nearly as bad as this score might indicate. But the Pirates were outgunned from the beginning and never challenged Illinois for the lead.</p>
        <p>Illinois: It was the best overall game, offensively and defensively, in Underwood’s three seasons.</p>
        <p>HE SAID IT</p>
        <p>“Trent Frazier absolutely controlled the game, defensively,” Underwood said. “That’s what this game is all about, defense. I think Trent has become one of the most elite defensive players, not just in the Big Ten, but in the entire country.”</p>
        <p>BY THE NUMBERS</p>
        <p>Illinois ranks second nationally in offensive rebounding percentage (45.8%), and is 12th nationally in defensive free-throw rate (17.5) - a huge improvement from last season when the Illini were 338th in the country in defensive free-throw rate.</p>
        <p>Illinois is the only team in the Big Ten Conference with three players averaging at least 14 points per game.</p>
        <p>Going into Saturday’s game, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kofi-cockburn/">Cockburn</a> was tied for the NCAA lead in double-doubles, was the No. 5 rebounder, and tops among freshman, averaging 12.6 rebounds per game.</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p>Hampton: Travels to San Francisco on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Illinois: Hosts Lindenwood on Tuesday, the fourth of a five-game homestand. The Illini play five of their next six games at the State Farm Center.</p>
