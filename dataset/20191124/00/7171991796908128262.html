      <h1>Mimic Artfully Employs LEDs In Fashion</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/lewinday/" target="_blank">Lewin Day</a></address>
      <p>Any science fiction piece set in the near-future involves clothes that light up or otherwise have some form of electronics inside. This hasn’t happened in mainstream fashion just yet, but [Amped Atelier] are doing serious work in the field. <i>Mimic </i>was their entry for the 2016 MakeFashion Gala, <a href="https://www.ampedatelier.com/mimic">serving as a great example of LEDs in fashion done right.</a></p>
      <p><i>Mimic </i>consists of two pieces, designed as cocktail dresses that mimic their surroundings, in much the same way as a chameleon. LEDs are controlled by an Arduino, fitted with a colour sensor. When activated, the Arduino can change the color of the LEDs to match whatever is presented to the sender. This technology could serve as a great way to avoid clashing with a friend’s outfit, or to send a surreptitious signal to your ride that you’re ready to leave.</p>
      <p>The LEDs are hidden beneath attractive geometric diffusers, which are 3D printed directly on to the fabric of the outfit. This gives an attractive, finished look to the garment, and allows the diffusers to naturally flow with the lines of the piece.</p>
      <p>These pieces show that it’s possible to create glowable night wear that is as stylish as it is high tech. If you’re looking for something a little edgier however, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/01/12/cyberpunk-jacket-is-the-garment-of-choice-for-the-streets-of-2019/">we’ve got that too.</a> Video after the break.</p>
