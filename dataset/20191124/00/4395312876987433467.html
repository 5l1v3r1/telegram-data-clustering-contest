      <p>Hey</p>
      <p>It’s Thanksgiving day in America next week and this reminds me how important it is for us to teach our students to express gratitude.</p>
      <p>It’s been proven that feeling thankful can benefit us in so many ways, such as</p>
      <p>*improving our relationships;</p>
      <p>*sleeping better;</p>
      <p>*feeling better physically and mentally;</p>
      <p>*reducing our stress levels;</p>
      <p>*boosting our happiness;</p>
      <p>*feeling more confident</p>
      <p>So this is what I did with my teenage students this week:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Step 1</b>
      </p>
      <p>I played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=aqLXGiqT2ZE&amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;utm_source=Greater+Good+Science+Center&amp;utm_campaign=96cf003128-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_GG_Newsletter_Nov_14_2019&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_5ae73e326e-96cf003128-74464015"><b>this video</b> </a>which shows how high school American students wrote a gratitude letter to someone special in their life. Then we talked about the people’s reactions and how the letter could affect their future relationship.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Step 2</b>
      </p>
      <p>I played my brand-new <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-668569432/gratitude-meditation"><b>GRATITUDE meditation</b></a>, which you can find <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-668569432/gratitude-meditation"><b>here</b></a>. The purpose of the meditation is to quieten the students’ mind and also help them review the day.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Step 3</b>
      </p>
      <p>After the meditation, I read the following writing prompt and gave the students 20 min to express their gratitude.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Think about someone who makes you feel better. Is it one of your parents, your best friend, a teacher or maybe an artist whose songs make you happy? Write a letter or poem to this person in order to express your gratitude.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Step 4</b>
      </p>
      <p>I was really impressed with my students’ letters and poems. I’ve noticed that every time I ask them to meditate before a writing activity, they manage to go deep within themselves and find emotions and experiences that they may have buried or forgotten.</p>
      <p>Here are a few more prompts that you can use:</p>
      <p>
        <i>During the meditation, you were asked to think about a person who was kind to you today. Write a letter to him/her expressing your gratitude for spreading kindness in the world.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Think about something difficult you´ve accomplished recently. What did you learn from this experience? Write a GRATITUDE letter to yourself for not giving up and sticking up to your goal.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Think about all the positive aspects of your life. Then write a poem to express your gratitude. Use repetition, for example, <b>I am thankful for….</b></i>
      </p>
      <p>Finally, I would like to share with you a poem that I wrote inspired by this mediation.</p>
      <p>
        <b>I am grateful</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I am grateful for the love in my life</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>and the fact that I feel alive.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I am grateful for the man, who loves me,</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Supports me and always spoils me.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I am grateful for feeling aligned</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>With the purpose, I’ve been assigned.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I am grateful for my daily inspiration</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>which has brought this insightful creation.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I am grateful for the students I teach</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>And inspire them by the way I preach.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I am grateful for the joy I bring</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>And how it makes my students’ hearts sing</i>.</p>
      <p>
        <i>I am grateful for the inner peace</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>and how this poem flows with ease.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>How would you mark THANKSGIVING DAY with your students?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Truly grateful,</p>
