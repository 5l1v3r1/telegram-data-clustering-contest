      <h1>Flamengo Confirmed as Brasileirão Champions Just 24 Hours After Copa Libertadores Success</h1>

      <p>Just 24 hours after sealing one of the most dramatic wins in Copa Libertadores history, Flamengo are celebrating once more - after they were confirmed as Campeonato Brasileiro Série A champions for a seventh time.</p>
      <p>Jorge Jesus' side were staring down the barrel of a disappointing defeat to River in South American football's most prestigious cup tournament, only for Gabriel Barbosa - known more commonly as Gabigol - to pop up with two late goals, turning the tie on it's head.</p>
      <p>That sealed a momentous second triumph in the equivalent of Europe's Champions League, the first time in 38 years that Flamengo had lifted the trophy. But if that wasn't enough, they have now sealed their first league crown in ten years - after reinventing themselves under the guidance of Jesus, who was only appointed as manager back in June.</p>

      <p>The 65-year-old, who has previously spent time managing fierce Portuguese rivals Benfica and Sporting CP, was a surprise appointment in Brazil, but his time at the club has been nothing short of spectacular.</p>
      <p>He has overseen a complete overhaul in Flamengo's style of play, getting the best out of the Barbosa, as well as veterans Filipe Luis and Rafinha, who joined in the summer on free transfers. He has implemented a strict disciplinary policy upon his players, helping to dispel the footballing myth that Brazilian players are not fond of hard graft.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Jesus has been thoroughly impressed with what he's seen during his time at the club, remarking (via <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/jorge-jesuss-incredible-flamengo-adventure-has-taken-him-to/181pmset9vq7l1hutj60d2hk2f">Goal</a>): “Now we have a rulebook. Hours in which you can and cannot do things inside and outside the club,” Jesus told reporters early in his Flamengo tenure – while admitting that he had to give way on one of his proposed restrictions, concerning the days his players could go to the beach.</p>
      <p>“There is an idea in Europe that Brazilian players do not like to work. The Portuguese saying is that if you have more than four Brazilians in your team, what you've actually put together is a samba band. But I came to see them and it is not the case: they are very professional and know what they are doing.”</p>

      <p>Now, he's celebrating the fourth league title of his career - having won three Primeira Liga crowns with Benfica - with four games of the season to go. Flamengo have lost just three times in their 34 league outings, winning 25 games to comprehensively outclass nearest challengers Santos, Palmeiras and Gremio.</p>
