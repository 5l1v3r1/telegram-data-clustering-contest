      <h1>Object Tracking Camera Slider Gets The Nice Shots</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/lewinday/" target="_blank">Lewin Day</a></address>
      <p>In this day and age, where all leisure activities must be duly captured and monetized online, camera sliders are hot items. Many start with a simple manual build, before graduating to something motorized for more flexibility. [Saral Tayal] took things a step further, <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Object-Tracking-Camera-Slider-With-Rotational-Axis/">implementing a basic tracking mode for even sweeter shots. </a></p>
      <p>The build is mechanically simple, relying on 8mm steel rods and linear bearings more typically found in 3D printers. An Arduino Uno is pressed into service to run the show, outfitted with an OLED screen to run the interface. A RoboClaw motor controller is used to control the geared DC motors used, one controlling the linear motion, the other the rotation of the camera.</p>
      <p>With encoders fitted to the motors, the RoboClaw controller enables the Arduino to track the position and rotation of the slider as it moves. The slider then can be given the position of an object relative to itself. With a little maths, it will rotate the camera to track the object as it moves along.</p>
      <p>It’s a simple addition to the typical slider build that greatly increases the variety of shots that can be achieved. There are plenty of ways to go about building a slider, too, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/12/27/motorize-your-camera-slider-the-hacker-way/">as we’ve seen before</a>. Video after the break.</p>
