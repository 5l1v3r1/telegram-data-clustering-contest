      <p><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Google-is-reportedly-coming-for-the-Apple-Card-with-new-financial-institution-partnerships.442757.0.html">Google Pay</a> is the Mountain View's increasingly effective digital-transactions platform with apps on <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Apple-to-change-in-house-testing-process-for-iOS-14-development.443891.0.html">iOS</a> and Android. XDA contributors <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pay-tests-safetynet-status-protecting-online-purchases-pin/">claim to</a> have found a new feature in the latter that may take effect in an upcoming public update. It is a new informative card in the top of its UI that tells the user if they are unable to make contactless payments using the service.</p>
      <p>Google Pay users typically lose this facility if their phone fails <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Some-Google-Pay-users-find-the-latest-Android-Q-beta-is-not-daily-driver-ready-the-hard-way.420411.0.html">SafetyNet</a>, a security feature built into Android that protects authentication-sensitive functions such as <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/No-Snapdragon-730G-New-Redmi-Note-8T-leak-will-leave-expectant-fans-disappointed.439879.0.html">NFC</a> payments. The most common explanations for such events are the detection of <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Pixel-4-s-Soli-Radar-can-be-enabled-in-any-region-thanks-to-a-hidden-debug-feature.440988.0.html">root access</a> or other advanced modifications in Android devices.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, the new Pay app's feature will communicate this to the user on start-up. It is triggered through a new SafetyNet API called <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pay-tests-safetynet-status-protecting-online-purchases-pin/">Attestment</a>, and may prevent situations in which users only find they can't make payments up until the moment they try to complete one.</p>
      <p>This service will also gain another new setting that may also control the ability to conduct transactions using mobile devices: <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1182202109753614337">PIN protection</a>. This has been discovered as an in-testing toggle within a new update to Google Pay by the researcher Jane Manchun Wong.</p>
      <p>It seems this new feature should require a <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Google-now-offers-a-US-1-million-bounty-for-Titan-M-chipset-vulnerabilities.444038.0.html">Google</a>-account number code every time an online purchase is attempted via <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Google-Pay-gets-dark-mode-in-new-update.431886.0.html">Pay</a>; however, the XDA has <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pay-tests-safetynet-status-protecting-online-purchases-pin/">reported that</a>, once discovered and activated, it is not as persistent as it should be quite yet.</p>
