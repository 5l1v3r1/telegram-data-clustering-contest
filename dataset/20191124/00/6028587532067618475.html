      <p><b>Hydro Flask 21 ounce Standard Mouth w/ Sport Cap</b>Job number one on any flight is staying hydrated. So the obvious answer is a sturdy and colorful <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/21-oz-standard-mouth-with-sport-cap/color,olive,a,92,o,140">Hydro Flask</a>. This combo marries a 21 oz. Standard Mouth Bottle and an insulated Sport Cap. TempShield™ insulation eliminates condensation and keeps beverages cold up to 24 hours. Made of 18/8 Pro-Grade Stainless Steel, it’s BPA-Free and Phthalate-Free. Bottoms up! $35.</p>

        <b>Sherpa Annapurna Featherless Down Jacket</b>
      </p>
      <p>I don’t care if you’re flying down to Rio, Recife or Rangiroa this winter. Inside the aircraft, it is invariably the month of January for much of the flight. You need to stay warm when you’re aloft and this new <a href="https://www.sherpaadventuregear.com/products/annapurna-featherless-down-jacket-mens">Annapurna Featherless Down Jacket</a> is my new favorite way to do so. It’s toasty thanks to 3M™ Thinsulate™ 75% Recycled Featherless Insulation, a loose-fill insulation that mimics down when dry and is warmer than down when wet. It’s a substantial jacket – use it as a pillow if need be — yet it compresses into a very small stuff sack so you can toss it in your carry on when you’re not wearing it. Of course, this puffy is ideal for winter travel once you land in Salt Lake or Stockholm or Sapporo. The hand-warmer pockets and the cinch to tighten the waist keep everything toasty. The hidden benefit is that a portion of the proceeds are donated to the Sherpa Adventure Gear Fund, which benefits the education of Nepali children. $190.</p>

      <p>Your shoes may come off once you settle into your seat, but you better have a snug pair of socks to keep your feet warm when the cabin temps descend. I’m a big fan of <a href="https://www.fitssock.com/">FITS</a>, a company that makes seemingly indestructible socks with a cushioned foot bed. They come in cools colors and are moisture wicking and quick drying, making them ideal for travel. But most importantly, these socks are made so they have graduated compression, which can improve blood flow and helps to prevent serious medical issues such as deep vein thrombosis, which can occur in some individuals on long flights. The fact that these are, at base, hiking socks means that they work well for most adventures. Light Hiker Mini Crews are $19.99 while Light Hiker Crews are $21.99.</p>

      </p>
      <p>On any flight, you want to be able to slip your shoes on and off with ease. No one should be padding around an airplane in their stocking feet alone. That’s why I love the new <a href="https://olukai.com/collections/mens-shoes/products/kahu-pahaha-mens-sneakers?variant=28046054391907">Kahu Pahāha</a> leather sneakers from OluKai. They have a full grain leather upper and an all-weather cup sole for a great grip. Yes, they do look great, but they also have a terrific OluKai feature, a collapsible heel, which turns them into slides. That’s easier than contorting yourself into a new yoga position to tie your shoes in your seat. They get points for style and practicality, the high water mark for on-board footwear. $130.</p>

      <p> <a href="https://www.eaglecreek.com/shop/sueno-andes-collection/wayfinder-backpack-30l-ec0a3sau#hero=0">The Eagle Creek Wayfinder 30L Backpack</a> gets the job done without extra bells and whistles. It’s big enough at 30 liters for your carry on needs but won’t trip you up at the gate the way a 40 liter will, especially in Europe, where they are much stricter about carry on sizes. You can stuff a lot of necessities in this bag, from toiletries to running shoes to a fleece. A light Gore-Tex rain jacket fits in perfectly. So does a laptop, a Kindle and the usual tangle of cords in a padded pocket There’s a side pocket for a water bottle, as well as an inside zippered compartment for a passport, with a key ring, and various organizer pockets. The fleece-lined front pocket for sunglasses is a welcome touch. $119.</p>

      <p>Sometimes smaller is better. The <a href="https://www.tortugabackpacks.com/products/setout-laptop-backpack">Setout Laptop Backpack </a>is just big enough for a laptop, iPad, chargers, and even a change of clothes. Or two, because even though it measures 18.5 x 12 x 6.75, it’s a 25 liter bag and it can hold more than it appears to. The DWR coating makes it water repellent and the YKK zippers are easy to lock. For a short trip, it’s a stylish carry on. $125.</p>

It weight just one pound, eight ounces, and measures 22 X 12.5 X 9. It has side grab handles, padded top haul handles, and removable backpack straps that make it easy to carry three different ways. The foam padded bottom protects your contents from impact and the lockable zippers are protected by a storm flap shield for extra water resistance. Made from TPU 600D Poly, 1000D Helix™ Poly Twill, it’ water repellent and pretty tough. $99.</p>

        <b>Travelpro Platinum Elite 21”Expandable Carry-On Spinner</b>
      </p>
      <p>Everyone seems to be using a hard-shell carry-on suitcase, except for me and a few others. I still like soft sided carry on suitcases. They are forgiving if you need to pack just one more thing, which is not uncommon. The best of them will expand in the event you buy too much at your destination and need to check the bag on the way home. The latest one to catch my eye comes from Travelpro, the company that brought us the original Rollaboard suitcase. Their new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Travelpro-Platinum-Expandable-Carry-Spinner/dp/B07DLB474M">Platinum Elite 21” Expandable Carry-On Spinner</a> is well worth considering. First, the important stats: it measures 21 by 14 x 9, which should pass muster with all of the major carriers. It’s an expandable carry-on spinner suitcase, 4-stop adjustable PowerScope handle and “magnatrac” spinner wheels for precise control and effortless roll. The fold-out suiter allows you to pack clothes wrinkle-free while the interior tie- down system includes built-in accessory pockets and TSA-compliant, removable quart-sized wet pocket for toiletries. There’s an external USB port and dedicated powerbank (not included) pocket that meets FAA regulations for carry-on and checked baggage. The bag is made of nylon with Duragardscuff-resistant, stain-resistant fabric. At $299 MSRP (but $210 on Amazon), it’s a good deal.</p>

        <b>Bucky 40 Blinks Eyemask</b>
      </p>
      <p>An eye mask is essential for me to actually sleep on airplanes. The ones that the airlines hand out are usually cheap and made with shiny fabric and they feel like you’re being blindfolded. You’re better off investing in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bucky-Ultralight-Comfortable-Contoured-Extensions/dp/B000WNX21Y">Bucky 40 Blinks</a> eyemask, which has a Velcro strap that adjusts easily. The eye covers are made of polyester and foam shaped to fit over your eyelids, not rest on them. Blackout comfort achieved. They come in a bunch of colors but I prefer basic black. $7.99.</p>

        <b>Eagle Creek Exhale Neck Pillow</b>
      </p>
      <p>It wasn’t until a 14 hour-plus flight from New York to Johannesburg a few years ago that I gave in and used a neck pillow for sleeping. I arrived in South Africa far more rested than I could have imagined and I’ve sworn by this pillow ever since. But I still don’t know why so many people lug those big foam donuts around with them. I swear by the <a href="https://www.eaglecreek.com/shop/travel-pillows/exhale-neck-pillow-ec041328?variationId=156">Eagle Creek Exhale Neck Pillow</a>. A few breaths and it expands into a comfortable pillow. Tug on the release valve and it goes back to a flattened size that easily stuffs into a tiny sack and stows easily in your carry-on. The exterior is removable and washable. Mission accomplished, without dragging a big foam donut across the planet. $27.95.</p>

        <b>Jack Mason Halyard Sport</b>
      </p>
      <p>My phone is always off inflight, so I’m a big believer in wearing a watch designed for travel, because I want to see just how many more hours I’ll be in the air before touching down in Tokyo or Toronto. To qualify, it has to be a watch that is affordable, stylish and will withstand the rigors of travel, skiing, and hiking and just about anything else I can put it through. It also has to be relatively cheap, so If it gets stolen, it can be readily replaced and not damage the bottom line. That leaves out most Swiss watches but it’s where the <a href="https://jackmasonbrand.com/pages/halyard">Jack Mason Halyard Sport</a> fits the bill. This shiny timepiece has a brushed 42mm stainless steel case that is water-resistant of up to 100 meters. I like the black unidirectional bezel, the white dial and the black Italian leather strap. It has a Japanese quart movement and comes with a limited warranty for defects of workmanship and material. The fact that it looks like a far more expensive watch - Swiss, perhaps — makes it a winner. $275.</p>

      <p>Speaking of watches, if a hefty chronograph doesn’t suit your style, grab one of the new <a href="https://www.allmies.com/">All Mies</a> Bauhaus watch. It’s very light and very slim, with a distinctive face that harkens back to Mid-Century modern style, albeit with a floating second hand dial in the upper right. The 41 mm watch has a California design with a Japanese movement. At $95, it’s affordable.</p>

      <p><a href="https://finalstraw.com/products/the-final-straw">Final Straw</a> because sometimes nothing but a straw will do and this collapsible stainless steel straw and cleaning brush in a plastic case takes up almost no space and satisfies your straw needs whenever they occur, including in-flight. $24.95.</p>

      <p>There are all sorts of overdesigned ear plugs out there that will set you back $20 or more for a pair. Save you money and buy the large jar of 50 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flents-Quiet-Please-Plugs-Pair/dp/B001J4HB1C/ref=sr_1_15?gclid=CjwKCAiAzuPuBRAIEiwAkkmOSGTFmfjrnHI4u0Oh8V6IV1oetOwTwpHWlaFl6NUTIoPC8YObjhb40BoC-1MQAvD_BwE&amp;hvadid=323681546782&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1023176&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvrand=13150102438755419835&amp;hvtargid=aud-840076997981%3Akwd-562070727054&amp;hydadcr=26633_10239427&amp;keywords=ear+plugs+for+sleeping+noise&amp;qid=1574541281&amp;sr=8-15">Flents Quiet Please</a> foam earplugs. I never travel without them and always stash a few pairs in my carry-on. These are delightfully low tech and incredibly effective at reducing aircraft noise, nattering neighbors who talk too loudly and ambient noise from flight attendants and their creaking serving carts. They’re comfortable and they tend to stay put. $11.99.</p>
