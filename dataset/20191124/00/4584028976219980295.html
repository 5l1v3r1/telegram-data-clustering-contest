      <p>William Wallace, president of the Secondary Schools Football League (SSFL), defeated incumbent David John-Williams to become new Trinidad and Tobago Football Association (TTFA) boss, at the Home of Football in Couva, on Sunday.</p>
      <p>It took two rounds of voting, but in the end, Wallace received 26 votes to John-William’s 20.  The first round of voting ended with no candidate able to get enough of the votes from the 46 delegates allowed to take part in the process.  The number needed to win the election was 24.  Wallace led with 20 votes, John-Williams had 16 and Richard Ferguson had 10.  Ferguson was as a result eliminated from the contest.  In the second round, it seems six of Ferguson’s supporters voted for Wallace and the remaining four selected John-Williams.</p>
      <p>The election result marked the end of a stormy tenure for John-Williams, who was often accused by his detractors of leading an authoritarian administration that lacked transparency.  The venue for the elections, the Home of Football, had long been held up as the crowning achievement of the John-Williams association and one of the main reasons it should have been handed a second term.  The argument, it seems, did not resonate well enough with the voters.</p>
      <p>In the vice-presidential contest, Clynt Taylor defeated Selby Browne 27-17 to claim the position of first vice-president.  Taylor is the Central FA general secretary while Browne, a member of John-Williams’ Team Impactors slate, is the interim president of the Veteran Footballers Foundation of Trinidad and Tobago (VFFOTT).</p>
