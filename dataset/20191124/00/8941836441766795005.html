      <p>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) - Maine plans to launch a $1.5 expansion of syringe exchanges to combat the surge in hepatitis C cases in the state.</p>
      <p>The Maine Center for Disease Control says the state has had 51 acute cases in 2019 and is running a rate nearly three times the national average.</p>
      <p>Director of the Maine CDC, Dr. Nirav Shah, says the cases of hepatitis C in Maine is “an unfortunate outcropping of the substance use crisis.”</p>
      <p>Executive director of the Health Equity Alliance, Kenney Miller, says the long-term goal’s to have at least one syringe exchange in all 16 counties.</p>
      <p>The Portland Press Herald reports there are currently exchange programs in Bangor, Ellsworth, Belfast, Machias, Portland, Augusta and Waterville.</p>
