      <p>The leader of the Homeland Study Group Foundation, Charles Kormi Kudzordzi, says he is still in Ghana contrary to claims that he fled the country after declaring some parts of Upper East, North East, Northern Region, Oti and Volta regions independent of Ghana.</p>
      <p>The Ho District Court last Wednesday, November 20, ordered the arrest of Mr Kudzordzi and two others over their unlawful declaration that they have separated those parts from Ghana and that they are now a sovereign state.</p>
      <p>This was after five other members of the group were remanded for treason after they took part in the activity which announced those parts independent and therefore now called Western Togoland.</p>
      <p>In a video posted on social media, Papavi, as he is also known said: “I am in the country anyway, I have not travelled or hidden anywhere, but I want the government to show maturity, invite me legally through my lawyers and I will present myself for the case to continue”.</p>
      <p>He also condemned the arrest of his people by the government of Ghana.</p>
      <p>“I want to the tell the government of Ghana that what has started happening is not the right thing; going round, arresting people in the streets, taking them and locking them up in cells and particularly taking my near 70year old wife and locking her up, no, that is not the right thing,” the 80-year-old leader of the group said in a video posted on social media.</p>
