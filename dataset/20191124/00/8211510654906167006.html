      <h1>Brazil GP promoter says Rio bid ‘not serious’</h1>
      <h2>Brazilian GP promoter Tamas Rohonyi does not believe a bid to switch the race to a new circuit in Rio de Janeiro is "serious"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:09+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">A cura della Redazione</a></address>
      <p>Interlagos officials have and are meeting with Liberty Media to discuss paying an annual fee in order to keep the Formula 1 race in Sao Paulo for the next decade.</p>
      <p>But Rohonyi told France’s Auto Hebdo that he is not overly concerned about reports suggesting Rio is a viable alternative for the sport.</p>
      <p>“I try not to comment on that project because it is not serious,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I do not know the person behind it and I do not doubt his good intentions, but there is no chance to build a circuit in that place in the next four or five years.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just a question of money, but of authority too. The place is a former military site used as a base that first needs all the ammunition that did not explode and is buried removed,” Rohonyi added.</p>
      <p>“It’s not even worth talking about.”</p>
      <p>La Gazzetta dello Sport claimed this week that Interlagos may even be protected by a clause in its agreements with Liberty.</p>
      <p>At any rate, Rohonyi thinks Interlagos has a good relationship with F1’s post-Bernie Ecclestone owner Liberty Media.</p>
      <p>“I hope so,” he said. “We do not have so many relationships, actually.</p>
      <p>“Chase Carey came here and we talked about anything and everything over coffee. It was very nice, but our relationship is primarily contractual,” added Rohonyi.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s very important for them to be here. The Brazilian GP is the only one in South America, it takes place on a marvellous circuit in front of a huge crowd and the city is the most important economic centre in the southern hemisphere.</p>
      <p>“So yes, I think it’s very important to them,” he said.</p>
