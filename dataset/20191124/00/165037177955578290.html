        <b>Frank de Boer took Flamengo's Copa Libertadores triumph, starring Gabigol, as an opportunity to criticise the Brazilian player's performance at Inter.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>2019's Libertadores and  Brazilian football hero</b> has not always had it easy. <b>Gabriel Barbosa 'Gabigol' </b>got off to a very early start and arrived at <b>Inter</b> at a very young age, perhaps even too young. As a result, he failed to succeed in Europe.</p>
      <p>On his return to Brazil, Gabigol has regained his place as the <b>undisputed star</b> and reached the climax of his career in the final of the continental tournament, with a double that will go down in South American football's history.</p>
      <p>But not everyone has forgotten his time in Italy. Inter coach <b>Frank de Boer</b> criticised Gabigol in Fox Sports.</p>

      <p>"I didn't know much about him, but <b>I was told he was a fantastic player</b>," said the Dutch coach. "He came with us with <b>two people who managed his social media and a bodyguard</b>, but he didn't do anything," continued the coach and former footballer.</p>
      <p>De Boer, the MLS coach for Atlanta United, revealed how his nickname was changed in Milan for his bad performances: <b>"They call him Gabigol, but we used to call him 'Gabi-no-gol'.</b></p>
      <p>Gabigol played ten official games for Inter and only scored one goal. In Benfica he was not much better, as he scored another goal in five games. He's back in Brazil, where <b>he's scored 67 in just over two years</b>.</p>
