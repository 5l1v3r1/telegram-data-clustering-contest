      <p>The Latest on Week 12 in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> (all times local):</p>
      <p>2:35 p.m.</p>
      <p>Mike Evans has joined Randy Moss as the only players to begin their careers with six straight seasons of at least 1,000 yards receiving.</p>
      <p>Evans had a slow start in Tampa Bay’s game against Atlanta before making a 17-yard catch late in the first half to extend a drive. Evans began the day with 993 yards on 58 catches.</p>
      <p>The Buccaneers lead the Falcons 19-10 at halftime.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a> and Washington - who entered this weekend with a combined record of 1-19 - both have halftime leads.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>The winless <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati-bengals/">Bengals</a> are up 7-3 on Pittsburgh. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a> fumbled opening kickoff but recovered, Ryan Finley fumbled on a sack but the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati-bengals/">Bengals</a> recovered. Also, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati-bengals/">Bengals</a> intercepted a pass at their own 3-yard line, so things have really gone their way - which is what they need to have a chance.</p>
        <p>The Redskins hadn’t led at any point since beating Miami in Week 6, but they are ahead of Detroit 13-6. The Lions are playing their third straight game without injured quarterback Matthew Stafford.</p>

        <p>Bills quarterback Josh Allen threw his first interception in his last 172 attempts in the second quarter when he was picked off by Broncos safety Justin Simmons.</p>
        <p>It was his first interception since being picked off in the third quarter of a 14-7 win over Tennessee in Week 5. It was also Buffalo’s first turnover in three-plus games; Buffalo had never gone four games in a row without a turnover.</p>
        <p>The Bills lead Denver 6-0.</p>

        <p>Jarvis Landry is getting revenge against his former team.</p>
        <p>Landry caught two touchdown passes from Baker Mayfield as Cleveland opened a 21-0 lead over the Miami Dolphins.</p>
        <p>Landry spent four seasons with the Dolphins, who traded him to Cleveland in 2018 after they decided not to give the three-time Pro Bowler a long-term contract. Landry said earlier this week that he had circled the matchup with Miami on his calendar.</p>
        <p>He opened the scoring with a 7-yard TD reception and later scored on a 5-yard pass from Mayfield, who also threw a 35-yard TD to Odell Beckham Jr.</p>

        <p>The Buffalo Bills scored field goals on their opening two drives and lead the Denver Broncos 6-0 in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>Buffalo opened the scoring on Stephen Hauschka’s 39-yard field goal that capped a 17-play, 69-yard drive in which the Bills converted three third-down opportunities.</p>
        <p>The Bills followed with a 12-play, 87-yard drive that stalled at Denver’s 5, leading to Hauschka’s 23-yard field goal.</p>

        <p>New Orleans scored two touchdowns less than 10 minutes into its game against Carolina, in part because of a successful challenge by Saints coach Sean Payton.</p>
        <p>Officials initially ruled a Saints punt was touched first by New Orleans and was not a fumble when the ball came down in a cluster of players. Replay showed the ball deflecting off of Panthers safety Rashaan Gaulden, and New Orleans, which had recovered the loose ball, took possession on the Carolina 27.</p>
        <p>A couple plays later, Tre’Quan Smith had an easy touchdown reception when Carolina’s defense froze on a play fake in the backfield to running back Alvin Kamara. The Panthers’ wariness of the Saints’ ground game at that point was understandable, given that New Orleans had finished its first possession of the game with Latavius Murray’s 26-yard TD run.</p>
        <p>Payton risked losing challenges for the rest of the game when he dropped the red flag after the muffed punt. Earlier, he challenged an offensive pass interference penalty called against Saints tight end Jared Cook on a big gain. Officials declined to overturn that call. Also on that play, left tackle Terron Armstead received treatment on the field for an apparent leg injury, then walked off gingerly before being carted to the locker room.</p>
        <p>Carolina quickly responded to the Saints’ second score with a TD of their own on a 51-yard pass from Kyle Allen to DJ Moore that made it 14-6.</p>

        <p>Cleveland Browns owner Dee Haslam is showing her support for suspended defensive star Myles Garrett.</p>
        <p>Haslam wore a stocking cap bearing Garrett’s No. 95 while on the sideline during pregame warmups. Garrett was suspended indefinitely by the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> for ripping off Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph’s helmet and hitting him over the head with it. The suspension was upheld Thursday by an appeals officer.</p>
        <p>Garrett will miss Cleveland’s final six games and the playoffs, should the 4-6 Browns make them. Team officials are hoping he can return in 2020. Garrett is required to meet with Commissioner Roger Goodell’s office before he can be reinstated.</p>
        <p>The league fined Garrett $45,623 for his actions in the final seconds of Cleveland’s 21-7 win on Nov. 14. Thirty-two other players - 21 Steelers and 11 Browns - were disciplined for their involvement in the brawl.</p>
        <p>The Browns visit the Steelers next Sunday.</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati-bengals/">Cincinnati Bengals</a> have had some awful teams in their half-century of existence. The 2019 version is on the verge of one ugly franchise record.</p>
        <p>If the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati-bengals/">Bengals</a> fall to their archrivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers, on Sunday at Paul Brown Stadium, they will drop to 0-11, the only winless team in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati-bengals/">Bengals</a> have matched their worst start in club history and longest losing streak. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a> has dropped 12 straight overall from last season, a club mark, and 17 of 18, the worst such stretch in its history.</p>
        <p>The Steelers have won nine straight in the series, 12 of 13 and 17 of 20, including a first-round playoff win at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a> in 2015 season. These <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati-bengals/">Bengals</a>, under first-year coach, Zac Taylor, can only dream of postseason appearances. They have the worst overall defense and worst rushing defense in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>.</p>
