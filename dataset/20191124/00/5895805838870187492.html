      <p>For anyone still claiming that women pursue careers in math less frequently than men because of biological differences: let that misinformation go. Little evidence has ever supported that school of thought, and the minimal amounts that have never successfully disentangled intrinsic biological factors from sociocultural ones.</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-019-0057-x">published a study</a> showing that the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/neuroscience">neural</a> functioning of boys and girls doing math was significantly <i>similar</i>. They used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)—a method that links brain activity to changes in blood flow—to determine what regions of young boys’ and girls’ (<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gender">gender</a> as reported by parents) brains are engaged when they’re doing math.</p>
      <p>Boys and girls ages 3-10 watched video clips that targeted early <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/child-development">childhood</a> mathematics skills like addition and counting. Researchers then compared the brain activity of each child with every other child, and then with every adult in a large comparison group. This provided measurements for child vs. adult “neural maturity”—a child with high neural maturity has a brain that performs (based on fMRI) like an adult’s would during mathematical processing—as well as child vs. child “neural similarity.”</p>

      <p>They found no difference in neural maturity based on the gender of the adult comparison group, and across multiple neural analyses boy and girl brains were equally engaged while watching the video clips. Much of their brain activity was focused in their intraparietal sulci, an area of the brain with distinct subregions that have been implicated in perceptual-motor coordination—for example, seeing a pen and then accurately reaching for it—and visual <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/memory">short-term memory</a>, but also in processing numerical information, which further supported their findings.</p>
      <p>In the end, this work showed statistical <i>equivalence</i> between boys and girls in terms of neural maturity and engagement with mathematics, which tells us that gender differences in mathematics fields do not stem from intrinsic biological differences in children, but more likely <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/environment">the environment</a> to which we subject them.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Submitted by Professor Fink on November 24, 2019 - 9:54pm</p>
      <p>At a recent cocktail reception in Manhattan, a friend sketched two bell curves, one much wider than the other. The narrower one placed slightly to the right. He explained to me they represented the distribution of male and female intelligence. He speculated that male intelligence was the wider curve—the implication being that woman may be a little smarter than men, on average, but most are just average. Men are more likely to be extremely smart or stupid.</p>
      <p>I might have written him off as a left-tail case, but something about his hypothesis felt familiar. I have a STEM PhD, yet I am still often asked in both professional and social situations if I found statistics hard. Meanwhile, I’ve noticed if a man has any type of graduate degree where he took almost any kind of math class that sounds vaguely difficult, he’s presumed to be a math whiz. If he dresses weird and is socially awkward people assume he’s an outright genius. If I acted that way, people would just assume I was rude and frumpy, not necessarily brilliant.</p>
      <p>It seems like many people agree women are just as smart—on average. A recent Pew survey claims a majority of Americans believe women display equal intelligence to men; women even have a slight edge on intellect perception. In the US, more women are in college. In 2012, 71% enrolled after high school, compared to just 61% of men. But when it comes to being exceptionally smart, funny, or talented, it feels like people still think that’s an exclusively male domain.</p>
      <p>The male variability hypothesis, which seems to be driving what I’ve observed, claims men have a wider distribution of intellectual ability, which means there are more men in the upper tail of the intelligence distribution. It has been around since the 19th century, an idea buffered by the fact that most major scientific contributions in the 20th century came from men. But even 100 years ago, a fierce debate raged as to whether the difference reflected that men are indeed naturally smarter or if it was a byproduct of social conditioning, which includes access to education and society’s expectations. If it were social, you’d expect the distributions to look more similar today because attitudes and access to education have changed.</p>
      <p>But even in these enlightened times, men still do display a wider range of intellectual ability. Using several different measures of intelligence including IQ and SAT scores, more men are found in the high and low tails, according to Josh Aronson, a professor of applied psychology at NYU. “Yes, the pattern that I see most often in the IQ literature, and the one that accords with my experience of nearly 40 years being near universities, is that you find more men at the extremes of performance, more among the mind-blowingly brilliant handful that you meet in a lifetime, and also more among the truly intellectually challenged handful. Within the extreme tails of the distribution, however, performance is generally equal between the sexes. But yes, men seem to have an edge at the extreme right end of of the bell curve.”</p>
      <p>As to whether it is biological or environmental, “I think some of that is social,” he says, “but I would be surprised if it were all social.”</p>
      <p>Researchers at Duke studied SAT scores of intellectually promising 7th graders (ages 12 to 13) over the last 30 years. The figure below took the ratio of boys to girls who scored in the top 1%, 0.5%, and 0.01% of the distribution in math scores (girls have a slight edge on the verbal SAT, but the differences are not nearly as large).</p>
      <p>Up to the top 1%, boys and girls are nearly equal. But the higher into the tail you get, the bigger the differences emerge—and the boys dominate. In the 1980s, there were 13.5 boys for every girl in the top 0.01%, now there are only 3.8. The decline shows a large share of the gap was social conditioning, whether because of girls being told they could not be great at math or not being encouraged to take hard math classes. But a significant gap remains—some of if representing that we have further to go and some of it raising more uncomfortable questions about differences in innate ability.</p>
      <p>Dave Lubinski, a psychology professor at Vanderbilt University, also studies the SAT scores of precocious 7th graders and tracks what happens to them in their careers. The oldest cohort is now 50 years old. He says once you narrow the population down to the 1 percenters in math, boys do score slightly higher. “But conditional on being in the 1% of math, the girls have better verbal skills.”</p>
      <p>This suggests women may be less likely to be extreme math stars, but they display a more well-rounded intelligence. It’s hard to separate out what’s biological and environmental because intelligence reflects what you study and how intensely you pursue it. People are often drawn to what they are good at and what they have access to. Lubinski and his coauthors observed that women are more drawn to working with people and jobs that prize communication. Many talented women, for a number of reasons like discrimination or just their personal preferences, don’t end up as research scientists.</p>
      <p>Perhaps this explains why a quantitative PhD does not buy me the same social allowances men seem to get. Lubinski stressed that men and women report similar levels of career satisfaction—though after speaking with him, part of me feels like I let my gender down by being a writer and not a micro-theorist.</p>

        <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/comment/1172017#comment-1172017">End sexist preferential programs for women</a>
      </h4>
      <p>Submitted by Frank on November 24, 2019 - 10:02pm</p>
      <p>The other side of sexism is the very frequent kind that is rampant today: the sexism that favors women and harms men. Examples are college programs that allow female engineering students to enter with lower grades, and preferential hiring and mentorship programs for women.</p>
      <p>This isn't just in math and the sciences, but in many office jobs.</p>
