      <p>Pat Williams wants to bring Major League Baseball.Seriously.</p>
      <p>The former Orlando Magic executive held a press conference this past week to talk about trying to land a baseball team for the theme park mecca.</p>
      <p>Williams’ contention is that Orlando is ready for MLB because it has 2.5 million residents in its metropolitan area. Furthermore, the city attracts 75 million tourists each year.</p>
      <p>Williams said he believes Orlando is a better market than those mentioned as possible expansion cities or places where a team with stadium issues like the Oakland Athletics or Tampa Bay Rays could relocate. Among the cities he mentioned where Charlotte, Las Vegas, Montreal, Nashville, Portland and Vancouver.</p>
      <p>Not to burst Williams’ bubble but it’s certainly hard to make any kind of case to place a third team in Florida or even move the Rays across I-4 to the land of Mickey Mouse.</p>
      <p>The Sunshine State has proven it can’t even support one MLB franchise. The Rays and Marlins are annually among the lowest franchises in attendance.</p>
      <p>The Rays drew just 1,178,735 this past season to Tropicana Field. That was pathetic considering Tampa Bay won 96 games, beat the Athletics on the road in the wild card and pushed the Houston Astros – who had the best regular-season record in the major leagues – to the full five games before losing in an American League Division Series.</p>
      <p>The Rays drew 2.5 million fans during their expansion season in 1998. They cracked 1.9 million in a season since then.</p>
      <p>Beyond being the only stadium in the major leagues with a permanent roof, the complaint about Tropicana Field is its location in south St. Petersburg. That represents nearly an hour’s drive for fans in the northern part of Tampa.</p>
      <p>The Rays have also unsuccessful tried to get a new ballpark built in the Tampa/St. Pete area for year. The latest failed attempt came last December when a proposed facility in Tampa’s Ybor City section fell through.</p>
      <p>Yet speaking of driving, have you ever tried to navigate I-4 in the Orlando area during tourist season? There are few experiences you can have in a vehicle that are worse.</p>
      <p>The Marlins’ situation isn’t any better as fans haven’t exactly flocked to Marlins Park since it opened in 2012. In fact, interest is so low in professional baseball in the city that the Marlins have yet to secure a naming rights’ deal for the 7-year-old facility.</p>
      <p>The Marlins haven’t come close to drawing one million fans the last two seasons. This year, the total attendance was 811,302. That was up all of 198 fans from 2018. Of course, Miami lost 98 games last year and 105 this year.</p>
      <p>Miami also had the lowest attendance in the major leagues in 2019. Tampa Bay was second.</p>
      <p>It is hard to blame the citizens of Miami for not supporting their team. Though the Marlins produced World Series winners in 1997 and 2003, they have usually not been competitive since joining the National League as an expansion franchise in 1993.</p>
      <p>Williams, though, is undeterred. He even has a nickname already selected for the Orlando team – the Dreamers.</p>
      <p>Quite ironic in a state that has turned out to be a nightmare for MLB.</p>
