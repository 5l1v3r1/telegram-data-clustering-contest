      <p>A few months ago, news hit newsstand that an up and coming 23 year old female entrepreneur by the name of Sophia Hutchins has raised $3 million in seed funding for her brand, health tech company LUMASOL. You may recognize Sophia’s name from other news, too – she’s partner to Caitlyn Jenner, and a recent graduate of Pepperdine University.</p>
      <p>LUMASOL, an odorless sunscreen that can be applied after makeup, is tackling the terrifying statistic that every year, skin cancer is diagnosed 4x more than any other type of cancer. “For me, that was an alarming statistic that no one was innovatively tackling,” Hutchins shared in an interview with me. “So, the LUMASOL brand mission is to inform consumers on just how harmful the sun’s rays are, while also providing them with an easy option for protection.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Makeup vs. Sunscreen</b>
      </p>
      <p>I myself live in Florida, and I’ve always struggled with wearing sunscreen or wearing makeup. It always seems that us women have to choose – and the frustration of this choice is exactly what Sophia is targeting. </p>
      <p>“We did a lot of consumer research before creating the product, and found that everyone was frustrated with just that tradeoff,” Sophia told me. “People should wear makeup whenever they want and still be protected.”</p>
      <p>But Sophia and LUMASOL are doing something different than many makeup brands who are simply adding SPF to their foundation. LUMASOL can be applied by spray after your full face of makeup is done – and its lightweight, odorless formula provides coverage while keeping your makeup intact. In fact, it actually works as a setting spray – but isn’t marketed that way so that it can also appeal to users who don’t wear makeup, men included.</p>
      <p>“We’re not competing with beauty brands. We’re not competing with sunscreen brands. We’re creating our own space,” Sophia said proudly.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sophia’s rise to entrepreneurial success</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sophia didn’t always see herself as an entrepreneur – she actually studied economics and finance at Pepperdine, believing she would go down the path towards being an investment banker. But once she came up with the idea for a makeup setting spray with SPF, the idea snowballed from there.</p>
      <p>“I was surrounded by entrepreneurs,” she shared, and this helped her kick her own entrepreneurial itch into high gear. But she was also faced with challenges: being young, blonde, a model, a female, and in the tabloids.</p>
      <p>“So, I also surrounded myself with people who believed in me, and saw that I’m good at what I could do and could execute it.” She also found that being over prepared and ready for anything always translated well, recounting an instance when she had about 80 tabs in her business plan for a pitch, so that she could always refer the group to the exact business plan page she was referring to.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Self-care while running a multimillion dollar company</b>
      </p>
      <p>While the company continues to scale, self-care is of the utmost importance. Here is what Sophia does to prioritize self-care, and what she recommends for others:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To always wake up at the same time every day and stick to a structure. “When your day has a structure, the rest falls into place,” she advised.</li>
        <li>To get plenty of sleep – and to make sure to go to bed early to be prepared for an early wake up (for her, it’s 6:00am).</li>
        <li>To make time for friends and family, even when very busy</li>
      </ul>
