      <p>The Cleveland Browns – finally – did what they were supposed to on Sunday in a 41-24 win over the tanking Miami Dolphins. The win, Cleveland’s third straight, improves its record to 5-6. Here are some takeaways from the win.</p>
      <h3>Jarvis Landry and Odell Beckham Jr. feasted</h3>
      <p>Baker Mayfield – excellent in the first half, inconsistent in the second half – now has more touchdowns on the season (14) than interceptions (13) after throwing a season-high three touchdowns against the Dolphins. He also threw all three to Jarvis Landry and Odell Beckham Jr., two very good wideouts who haven’t been on the same page as Mayfield this season.</p>
      <p>Landry had 10 catches on 13 targets for 148 yards and two touchdowns. Against an admittedly bad Dolphins secondary, Landry was able to get seperation whenever he wanted. He also had what was perhaps the play of the day with this catch right up against the sideline. Mayfield also placed this perfectly:</p>
      <p>For Landry, Sunday marked the fourth-straight game <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/gamelog/_/id/16790/jarvis-landry">where he’s scored a touchdown.</a> It’s taken about a season’s worth of games, but he and Mayfield seem to have developed chemistry.</p>
      <p>As for OBJ, the partnership with Mayfield still isn’t everything it could be. He had six catches on eight targets with Mayfield’s one interception coming on a throw that was placed behind Beckham. But they also connected on Beckham’s<a href="https://twitter.com/Browns/status/1198676579259502592"> first touchdown since Week 2 </a>against the New York Jets. The play was good play design by Kitchens to <a href="https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/highlights/play/type/team/season/week/playerId/2019112404/993">have Beckham attack the deep safety at full speed</a> and have Mayfield look for him with Landry and Nick Chubb available if Beckham or Rashard Higgins weren’t open deep.</p>
      <p>Sunday was the third straight game where Beckham was targeted at least eight times, so there’s at least some effort being made to get more out of Mayfield.</p>
      <p>Landry and Beckham <a href="https://twitter.com/thecheckdown?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">also mimicked DaBaby’s bop dance</a> during a touchdown celebration. Truly elite work from the duo.</p>
      <h3>Nick Chubb is still the team’s workhorse</h3>
      <p>Freddie Kitchens has clearly decided to make Kareem Hunt a part of the Browns’ offensive attack. And Hunt did score his first touchdown on Sunday and finished with 45 total years.</p>
      <p>But there is also no questioning that Nick Chubb is what makes the Browns’ work, even when it doesn’t want to. Seemingly every time Kitchens called a run play for Chubb, it ended up in at least five yards gained. (For the day, he averaged an even five yards per carry. Funny how that works.)</p>
      <p>Fittingly, Chubb put the exclamation point on Sunday’s win by running it in from – you guessed it – five yards out and churning through multiple Dolphins to get there. Without question, he has been the Browns’ offensive MVP this year.</p>
      <h3>The pass rush without Myles Garrett (and Olivier Vernon and Larry Ogunjobi) just isn’t the same</h3>
      <p>Coming into Sunday’s game, the Dolphins had the league’s 30th ranked offensive line, <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/ol/2019">per Football Outsiders</a>, and only the winless Cincinnati Bengals had given up as many sacks. In a post-Myles Garrett world, and with Olivier Vernon out for a third straight week with a knee injury and Larry Ogunjobi suspended, this was a chance for the Browns’ pass rush to show it was more than its top-line players.</p>
      <p>That, though, didn’t happen. Ryan Fitzpatrick was sacked four times – twice by Sheldon Richardson, once by T.J. Carrie and once by Porter Gustin – but this wasn’t the type of pressure Cleveland has had at times this year, led by Garrett on the edge. Getting Ogunjobi back next week – and Vernon back at some point – should help. Until Garrett is back in 2020, it’ll be up to Ogunjobi and Vernon to provide pressure and to defensive coordinator Steve Wilks to adjust his scheme and dial up more designed pressure. No Garrett denies the team the luxury of not sending extra bodies at the quarterback with regularity.</p>
      <h3>Playoff watch</h3>
      <p>The Oakland Raiders’ 34-3 loss to the New York Jets helps the Browns’ still slim playoff hopes. So did the Indianapolis’ Colts’ loss to the Houstons Texan earlier this week. Heading into Week 12, the Browns’ playoff hopes aren’t dead yet. Considering the franchise’s track record and everything that’s happened so far this season, that in itself is a miracle.</p>
      <p>After Sunday’s win,<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-nfl-predictions/?ex_cid=rrpromo"> FiveThirtyEight’s model </a>gives the Browns with a 30% chance of making the playoffs. If Cleveland is going to make the playoffs, next Sunday’s game against the Pittsburgh Steelers is a must-win. Pittsburgh, after surviving against the Bengals on Sunday, is 6-5. Neither the Browns or Steelers are likely to catch the 8-2, AFC North leading Baltimore Ravens and both teams need every bit of help possible to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/standings/_/group/conference">survive a crowded AFC Wild Card picture.</a> If Cleveland wins next week, and improves to 2-0 against Pittsburgh, that would give them a tiebreaker and a needed advantage heading into the season’s stretch run.</p>
