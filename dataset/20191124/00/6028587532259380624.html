      <p><a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/registered-nurses.htm">Registered nurses</a> are one of the fastest growing and in-demand occupations. With a median salary of over $71,000 it’s no wonder it’s a career many would choose. Many colleges and universities offer nursing programs and most graduates are successful at landing a good paying job. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/wesleywhistle/2019/11/20/department-of-education-releases-earnings-data-by-major/">New data released from the Department of Education</a> provides a look at how well these programs are at doing this and just how much debt their graduates have as they enter their career.Earlier this year, the Department of Education released the median debt of graduates from programs at colleges across the country. This week they added to that data and included the median salary of graduates one year after graduation. For many programs, one year out is hardly a fair measure of success as incomes can drastically change over time. However, for career oriented programs like nursing, it gives a good snapshot of the success of graduates and an indicator of their ability to repay their debt.</p>
      <p>Of course, there are many different types of nursing programs out there, ranging from the associate degree level to doctoral degrees. Many are transitioning away from associate degree programs, so let’s take a look at the bachelor’s degree program. At the median institution, the median debt for a bachelor’s degree in nursing is just below $24,000—below the average debt for a four-year degree nationally. However, those debt loads vary tremendously from just under $7,500 all the way to almost $50,000.</p>
      <p>At the median institution, the median salary one year after graduation for a bachelor’s degree in nursing is $61,000. The median salaries vary from $47,000 to over $100,000 just one year after graduation. The chart below shows the distribution of nursing programs across the country comparing debt and income.

      <p>As students look for schools to study nursing these data can be helpful to ensure they aren’t being saddled with debt and little income to show for it. These data can be especially useful when comparing two schools. Of course, there are many factors to consider, but these two are important points that could inform the decision making of students across the country.</p>
