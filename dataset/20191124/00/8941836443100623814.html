      <p>THE HAGUE, Netherlands — Retired Dutch football star <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marco-van-basten/">Marco van Basten</a> has apologized for saying “sieg heil” during a live television show after a German coach was interviewed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marco-van-basten/">Van Basten</a>, working as an analyst for Fox Sports, was off camera Saturday when he used the German phrase for “hail victory” that became notorious for its use at Nazi rallies.</p>
      <p>Later in the show, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marco-van-basten/">Van Basten</a> said: “It was not my intention to shock people. I apologize.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marco-van-basten/">Van Basten</a>’s comment came on a weekend during which Dutch soccer clubs were putting extra emphasis on fighting racism by standing still for a minute at the start of matches.</p>
