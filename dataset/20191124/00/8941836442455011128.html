      <h1>‘Young and the Restless’ marks Peter Bergman’s milestone</h1>

      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Five years ago, “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-young-and-the-restless/">The Young and the Restless</a>” celebrated <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/peter-bergman/">Peter Bergman</a>’s quarter-century on the daytime serial with a cake and speeches. The actor says he didn’t expect any fuss over his 30th year playing Jack Abbott, but producers devised a plot twist.</p>
      <p>To honor the anniversary, Monday’s episode is all about Jack and those close to him.</p>
      <p>As he reads his sister Traci’s (Beth Maitland) family memoir, his past is revisited with clips from previous seasons and appearances by other Abbotts, including Eileen Davidson as Ashley.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/peter-bergman/">Bergman</a> said he found the retrospective moving and hopes viewers enjoy it as well - including the succession of hairstyles and fashions over the decades.</p>
      <p>The actor stepped in as Jack on Nov. 27, 1989, replacing Terry Lester as the rival to Eric Braeden’s Victor Newman.</p>
