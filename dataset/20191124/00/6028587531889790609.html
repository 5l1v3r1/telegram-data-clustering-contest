      <p>Upon entering Decathlon, an AI-forward sporting goods store located on Market Street in San Francisco, I was cheerfully greeted by a human sales associate who asked if he could be of assistance. “I’m here to see your robot,” I confessed as he walked me over to Tally who was busy scanning RFID tags. Her message said, “Stock Check” but quickly changed to “Hi, I’m Tally!” as I leaned in for a photo. “People come in all day long to selfie with her,” the sales associate told me. “She’s great for business because she draws customers into the store, but she’s not a tourist attraction. Tally is on staff to provide insights into how to better manage our merchandise.” According to the research group, IHL, <a href="https://www.ihlservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WeLostAustralia-Outline.pdf">the retail industry loses a trillion dollars each year as a result of inventory distortion</a>. This is the problem co-founders Brad Bogolea, Mizra Shah and Jeff Gee set out to solve when, in 2014, they founded Simbe Robotics, the company that makes Tally.</p>

      <p>Today, Simbe offers a robust data analytics platform powered by advanced AI, machine learning and computer vision technology that powers their automated front-of-store robot.</p>
      <p>I had a chance to talk with Simbe’s founders about the rise in demand for retail automation and their plans to scale. What follows is an edited transcript of our discussion:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why did you name the company Simbe?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s a play on <b>sim</b>ulated <b>be</b>ing, robots working in concert with people.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s your origin story? </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Bogolea: </b>We have our roots in Silicon Valley’s legendary Willow Garage founded by Google billionaire Scott Hassan who wrote Google’s early page rank code with Larry Page and Sergey Brin. In 2006, he began recruiting some of the best and brightest roboticists in the world to develop the Robot Operating System (ROS), a flexible, open source platform, and the PR2, a high end research robot with out-of-box functionality, the de facto standards for building robotic applications today. </p>
      <p>In 2012, my Penn State roommate, Shah, went to work at Willow Garage with his friend Jeff Gee, an industrial designer who had been researching human robot interactions in retail and thinking about how robots can take care of mundane, monotonous tasks for people.</p>
      <p>Late 2013, as Willow began shutting down, the three of us came together and started building a robotics platform to address what seemed to be a data-driven problem that retail was facing.</p>

      <p><b>Bogolea: </b>We look at it this way. The global retail market is huge and is going to support 25,000 or more of these devices over the next five years. We’re working with more than a dozen of the largest retailers in the world including super regionals Schnuck’s, Giant Eagle and Decathlon in the U.S., Groupe Casino and Carrefour in Europe and the Middle East, and the largest physical grocer in Japan. We are planning to deploy another 1,000 robots over the next two years in partnership with SoftBank Robotics who already have their Pepper robots deployed all over Asia, America and Europe, so we have access to their shipping and logistics expertise.</p>

      <p>We just raised $26 million in a Series A in September and are ultra capital efficient having built our business on less than $10 million in just a few years. By comparison, it took our competition nearly 30 years and $100 million to bring their first product to market.</p>
      <p>We’re also backed by a tremendous talent pool which includes Softbank’s Masa Son who is very passionate about robotics, early Nest investor David Pakman of Venrock, “Father of the iPod” Future Shape’s Tony Fadell, and Head of Google’s growth equity fund who took Safeway public, CapitalG’s Scott Tierney.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The robots in this space have a similar look, why is that?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Bogolea:</b> What you see are really strong industrial design principles that we share as the robot needs to be a certain height so it won't tip over, etc. The big differentiator for our design is we don't use an external light source because we find it distracting to the store team and customers when the robot is turning to capture an end cap and shines its bright light down the aisle.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Are one of the shared design principles that the robot must be adorable?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Gee: </b>Yes, in design,<b> </b>you need to consider how to bring about acceptance, awareness, and trust. You don’t want customers to feel threatened or anxious as they share their space with an autonomous device. A face and a name make it easier. Without a face, the robot might be perceived as scary or unknown<b>. </b>People relate better and engage more with a robot they find appealing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When customers engage with Tally is she recording their images or conversations?</b>
      </p>
      <p>No, she doesn’t capture recognizable images of people. She only takes high resolution photos of the RFID tag data.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You seem to be a Google house. Why have you chosen Google cloud services for your stack?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Bogolea:</b> We use Google Cloud because it has significant experience handling massive amounts of data as part of its core business. Amazon also resonated but from a retail market alignment, Google is independent. Most retailers don't want you working with Amazon. </p>
      <p>
        <b>What drew you to solve this problem?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Bogolea:</b> It’s about transforming retail and, at the end of the day, this is a problem that touches everyone across the retail value chain.</p>
      <p>As a shopper, 1 in 10 products on a customer list are not on the shelf. A quarter of Amazon's purchases online actually come from people that went to a physical retail store first to buy it and couldn't find it. So this is a problem that not only touches the consumer. When a product is not on shelf, it affects the brand. </p>
      <p>Out of stocks are the biggest problem. On average physical retailers lose somewhere about 4% of annual revenue to product not being on shelf. That's a really big number and adds up to $1 trillion a year.</p>
      <p>The second biggest problem is pricing and promotional execution. Retailers compete through price elasticity. There are also markets where if the product is not properly represented on shelf at the right price, you get it for free. Pricing execution is massive. We're analyzing 10,000 prices per frame in certain markets. In the Midwest and Mideast regions, retailers lose tens of millions per year for prices not being correct either on display or point of sale.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why is it taking so long to modernize physical retail?  </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Bogolea:</b> Retail hasn't changed much since the invention of the barcode but there are a lot of innovative strategies being explored as we’re now hitting a critical inflection point in what we’re calling the “Amazon effect” where it can be faster to get a product online than trying to find it in a physical store.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16008589011">Amazon Go</a> is a great example. Amazon has spent more than $300 million opening 14 stores. They have a crazy labor mix, something like ten times the labor of the average 7-eleven. In the convenience store market, half of purchases are actually done with cash and the other half of purchases are for age-controlled substances like cigarettes, lottery tickets, medicine and alcohol. If you go to buy any of that at an Amazon Go, you need to talk to someone and swipe a driver's license.  </p>
      <p>Using fixed cameras and fixed infrastructure to solve the problem of auto-replenishment is very capital intensive. Additionally, what's within the four walls always change. As many stores operate on razor thin margins the cost can be prohibitive. An individual 7-eleven owner likely doesn't have the ability to pay for the amount of energy that Amazon Go sensors consume.</p>
      <p>As for the supermarket of the future, the fixed infrastructure business case isn't there yet but we may start to see AR and NLP play a bigger role.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you believe in the retailpocalypse?</b>
      </p>
      <p>No, I don’t. Physical retail isn’t going away anytime soon. More stores locations are opening than closing in certain areas. What the Amazon effect is forcing businesses to be proactive and view technology, like retail robots, as a competitive differentiator in managing the real time expectations of customers.</p>
