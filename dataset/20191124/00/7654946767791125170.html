      <h1>Uber wins small court victory in California rape suit; victim vows to pursue case</h1>

      <p>Uber won a court victory when a judge dismissed part of a federal lawsuit filed by a woman claiming the company was at fault for her alleged rape — because her attacker’s car was clad with an Uber decal, signalling to her it was a safe ride.</p>
      <p>A federal judge decided Friday that the driver was not acting in the scope of his employment when he allegedly picked up the woman from a San Francisco-area shopping mall in 2018, drove her to a secluded location and raped her, because he was suspended from the company at the time for allegedly harassing another female passenger, <a href="https://www.law.com/therecorder/2019/11/22/uber-cant-completely-shake-jane-doe-assault-case/">The Recorder reported.</a></p>
      <p>The woman allegedly mistook the ride for a legitimate Uber, because the company logo was plastered to the man’s car.</p>
      <p>The man is facing criminal charges.</p>
      <p>California Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley also dismissed the Jane Doe’s claim that Uber was responsible for meeting a higher standard than common carriers — defined by law as transportation services offered to the general public — are required to follow.</p>
      <p>Corley said the passenger can revise and refile her complaint. Her lawyer, Matthew Davis, pledged they would.</p>
      <p>“We are going to amend the complaint and proceed with the case,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-22/uber-defeats-rider-rape-suit-over-decal-on-imposter-s-windshield?srnd=premium">he told Bloomberg News.</a></p>
