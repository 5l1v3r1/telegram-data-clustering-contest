      <p>In a move to refurbish the railway sector in Ghana, the Ministry of Railway Development has begun repairing grounded trains in the country using local artisans.</p>
      <p>Andy Appiah Kubi revealed the process would have been completed but for the torrential rains that disrupted the processes but is in the verge of completion now.</p>
      <p>The Deputy Minister said a test run would be conducted upon completion of the reconstruction work, after which a definite date for reopening of the rail line would be announced.</p>
      <p>According to him, the railway sector was dead when government assumed office in 2016, where workers were not paid for over six months.</p>
