      <p>The New York Mets are a good baseball team, but it turns out they don’t give out awards for that. In fact, there is no guarantee in this particular case that having all the talent the Mets have assembled is good for more than fourth place in their own division. After all, it was only enough for third place in 2019. The division leading Braves have already made significant additions to their bullpen, the Nationals aren’t going anywhere, even if they can’t retain both Stephen Strasburg and Anthony Rendon, and the Phillies seem prepared to double down on last winter’s spending spree to get them over the top. That’s without getting into the rest of the National League, with whom they will have to compete for the Wild Card if they can’t clamber over that trio. Before we get into some moves the Amazins might make, let’s take a quick look at where they sit going into the offseason. One of their top starters, Zack Wheeler, is a free agent, and while there is interest in a reunion, there is also some thought that he will get bigger offers elsewhere. Todd Frazier, their loyal third baseman of the last two seasons is also on the open market, and the Mets may simply replace him internally with J.D. Davis, among others. Yoenis Cespedes has apparently “resumed baseball activities,” though what he will bring to the team after missing all of 2019 and most of 2018 is anyone’s guess. The Mets will also have a full year of Marcus Stroman, who they acquired at the last trade deadline.</p>
      <p>The biggest potential change from 2019 to 2020, however, could come from a player who played all last season and remains on the team: reliever Edwin Diaz. When the Mets traded for Diaz as the centerpiece of the (disastrous) trade that also brought them Robinson Cano and the unprofitable end of his contract, Diaz was thought to be among the best closers in baseball. What the Mets got was a meltdown machine. Mysteriously, his stuff remained elite. His fastball velocity and strikeout rate were still top notch, and he even got high marks using Statcast’s expected batting average and slugging. Where things went off the rails was on contact: when he gave it up, it was all hard. He’s a good guess for a bounceback candidate, but until it happens, we can’t assume it will. It’s safe enough to assume he will improve on his 5.59 ERA of 2019, but whether he returns to being elite could swing the Mets season.</p>
      <p>With all that as context, here are some moves the Mets could make to jump out of the National League’s middle class.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Trade for a centerfielder</b>
      </p>
      <p>A speedster with some offensive skills who can patrol the middle of the outfield would address several needs for the Mets. Starling Marte is the big target, but Jackie Bradley Jr. will be substantially more affordable. Either way, it’s likely that the lovable Dominic Smith would be sent the other way in exchange. Smith can hit, but with Pete Alonso ensconced at first base, Smith doesn’t really have a position on the Mets, their tolerance of his outfield play in 2019 notwithstanding. Both Marte and Bradley would provide a defensive boost, and Marte would lengthen their lineup with a multitool threat. Bradley is an excellent defender who has shown flashes at the plate, but at this point the safe bet is that the breakout season is never going to come. He’s still useful, and would be a good addition at the right price.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Boost the bullpen</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Mets potentially have a great bullpen right now, but that’s only if everyone finds the better version of themselves at the same time. Another lefty to pair with Justin Wilson would help, as would anyone who can get outs these days. Will Harris or a reunion with Collin McHugh would both help, as would lefty Jake Diekman. The Mets also might look at pitchers who have primarily been starters, like Tanner Roark and Andrew Cashner.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Figure out the catching situation</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wilson Ramos can hit, but he gets poor defensive marks, and the team had to deal with a major distraction last season when it was revealed that starter Noah Syndergaard didn’t like throwing to him. Ramos still provides enough value to keep around, but it’s also clear enough the Mets could use another viable option at catcher – one who could at least get regular starts when Syndergaard takes the mound.</p>
      <p>Do all that, and the Mets have a real shot. Signing Anthony Rendon would help too, but it’s a nearly forgone conclusion that this team won’t spend the sort of money it would take to lure a player of his caliber. Instead, the Mets will have to find value and plug holes, and hope it all adds up to October baseball.</p>
