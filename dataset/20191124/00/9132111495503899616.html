      <p>The Alliance for Social Equity and Public Accountability (ASEPA) has called on the University of Ghana to reinstate Professor Ransford Gyampo and Dr. Butakor and sue the BBC instead over the sex for grade documentary.</p>
      <p>According to the Executive Director of ASEPA Mensah Thompson, the BBC has shown gross disrespect to the University by refusing to testify before the committee probing the sex allegations against the two lecturers.</p>
      <p>In a letter to the Vice-Chancellor of the University, ASEPA reiterated its stance “the fact-finding committee did not find the allegation of sex for grades against these two lecturers to be true, but the University failed to explicitly communicate that to the public in that release”.</p>
      <p>It added: ” We cannot unduly victimize our own because of a foreign media who do not have the guts to appear before a fact-finding Committee and defend their own work and the University must take legal actions against BBC Africa Eye and claim damages for all the needless harm it has caused to its reputation.</p>
      <p>“We cannot victimize our own who have worked so hard and contributed immensely to the growth of the University when what we actually need to do is to rally together and fight the intruder, who only came to sniff non-existing evidence in a desperate desire to weaken the global reputation of the University of Ghana. We cannot sit down and watch on whiles such grave injustice is perpetrated against fellow Ghanaians Citizens just because it is BBC, is the BBC Africa Eye infallible?</p>
      <p>“As the Chief Disciplinarian of the University, It is our hope that you dismiss this case, reinstate Prof. Gyampo and Dr. Butakor and take steps to pursue BBC Africa Eye for gross violations, unlawful invasion and for defaming the image of the University. Failure to do so may constitute a tacit complicity on the part of the University in weakening the potency and credibility of the University Ghana Certificate and that may be a justifiable reason to initiate legal action against the University”.</p>
