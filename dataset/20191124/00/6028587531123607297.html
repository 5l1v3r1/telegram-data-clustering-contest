      <p>Pink Floyd's 1979 double album opus <i>The Wall</i> became a milestone in pop culture, spending 15 weeks at No 1, spawning a landmark tour, a 1982 film based on the album and the chart-topping hit "Another Brick In The Wall (Part 2)" as well as the classic rock staples "Comfortably Numb," "Hey You" and "Run Like Hell."The album's place in rock history is based on the sum of its parts, which include the visuals, from the packaging and artwork to the animation in the 1982 film, by famed British cartoonist Gerald Scarfe.</p>
      <p>Now, after an original painting of "The Scream," from <i>The Wall</i>, sold for an astounding $1.8 million in 2017, Scarfe is auctioning off many of his Pink Floyd <i>The Wall</i>-era works, which he hopes go as a collection, rather than in individual pieces. The auction will be held online via Sotheby's beginning November 29 through December 6.</p>
      <p>In advance of the auction I spoke with Scarfe about what made his working relationship with Pink Floyd architect Roger Waters so special, what it was like behind the scenes in creating the artwork for <i>The Wall</i> and being part of a cultural phenomenon.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Steve Baltin: Tell me about the auction.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gerald Scarfe: Sotheby's is giving me a big sale in the beginning of December. A kind of online sale. So I'm collecting that,trying to get all that work together. And then there's a friend of mine who works on the Disney thing <i>Beauty And The Beast</i> wants me to do some stage work for that. That kind of stuff. And I've just finished a weird thing really, a German commercial for vegan chocolate. What they wanted was these animals being marched into the dairy and they wanted them marching into the dairy in the manner of my marching hammers in Pink Floyd <i>The Wall</i>. I said, "Those hammers in <i>The Wall</i> were a menacing force, whereas cows you can't call them a menacing force." They didn't see that argument. They just wanted to have them being marched in against their will and then being milked.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Baltin: Most artists don't go back and look at their work so when they do it is surprising. I imagine that is the case for you with all your Pink Floyd works.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scarfe: To look at things in perspective is totally different than being actually involved in it at the time. When Roger first came to me, originally I was on <i>Wish You Were Here</i> and had a relationship with the band there. But the real start of it I suppose was when Roger came with tapes of <i>The Wall</i> and played them to me. We talked about what we would do; how it would be an album, a show and a movie. All of which he kind of pulled off. But at that time, although he said that, he didn't have any sense of reality. They were this huge rock group and therefore there was a lot going for it. But you can never be 100 percent sure anything was gonna happen. Anyway things come down to almost daily tasks to do. And certainly when I was directing the animation and designing the film it was almost a daily thing to achieve the 10 or 20 things I had to during that day. So you're on a kind of treadmill racing ahead. And you're not thinking in any way, "Oh, I'm producing an iconic film here." There's no feeling of that, for me anyway. I just feel like I gotta get the day done and then maybe I might get a little time off on the weekend, which I rarely did. So it's very much a work in progress type thing. Looking back on it now I'm absolutely amazed that it really has become what it has. It's an iconic piece of work. And I'm proud naturally that allying my visual to their sounds really worked and even today I get emails every week probably from big Pink Floyd fans around the world. Roger said to me at one point when they were displaying the flowers onto the wall during the concert, "You're a rock star now." And I said, "I'm not." He said, "Yes you are, listen." And when the flowers came on there was this huge swirl of crowd response. I don't normally get that as an artist because I work pretty well in a solitary way in my studio. And that kind of reaction, the rock star reaction, doesn't come my way at all really. Naturally when I'm working in the theater or ballet or whatever I have a collaboration. It's not completely solitary. But mostly an artist's life is pretty solitary. And that was really my experience going back to <i>The Wall</i>. It wasn't a solitary experience. It was collaborative with them. But it was very low key and it was just getting jobs done week by week, day by day. Then I guess there was the mounting excitement, "This could be something" or, "This is gonna be great." There again you can never be a hundred percent sure. And when you've come to getting the money for movies and all that, big movies, you know how difficult that is. So you've always got doubts all the way through. And when artists do review their work they tend to see what's wrong with it rather than what's right with it. And I guess that's not entirely my reaction to viewing Pink Floyd again. But I can see a lot of it is a lot better than I thought it was from memory. But this collection I would like to sell because I want it to be kept in one place if possible is a complete history, certainly in the visual side, and some of the sound side and film side of putting this whole enterprise together.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Baltin: As you went through everything did it bring back specific memories?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scarfe: When it began to get sort of big I remember thinking, "This is extraordinary that something which seemed like a normal job..." because I'd done lots of theater, but with the power of Pink Floyd behind it of course that shifts it higher into the stratosphere than it normally would if you're working on Mozart even.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Baltin: But Pink Floyd didn't have the power they did until <i>The Wall</i>. That brought them much more into the mainstream, certainly in the States at least, and no one could have know a song whose refrain was, "We don't need no education" would be a top 10 hit.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scarfe: It certainly comes from left side sometimes or where you don't expect it to. There are so many things that feed into it and I think in Britain "Another Brick In The Wall," at that time, one of the critics said, "This is absolute scandalous because it's saying, 'Kids don't need no education.'" He misunderstood it, but all of that kind of helped. So it depends on the kind of publicity you get. But nevertheless, beyond that, I think there is something integral in a work of art that hits the public imagination. And it may be the time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Baltin: But are there specific things that surprise you when you reexamine all of this stuff?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scarfe: In the particular case of the album cover I had to create all the characters — the wives, the mother, the teacher and all these semi-cartoon characters. And I had to create them very, very quickly because obviously the album came out first and I remember being, I think the band were in France at the time and I kept flying down to the South of France. And I actually designed the album cover on Roger's kitchen table. So I had to have all these characters come out immediately. But luckily somehow I got them right and then followed the marching hammers and all the other kind of images that people tell me resonate with them. They all came out in a very short period for this particular piece of work. So when I look back I look back with a sense of relief for one thing. "Thank god that was the way it went because they might have been all crap." I felt at the time as if I was on a roll. I did feel, "This is good."I did have a thrilling feeling running through me, that this was something very exciting to be working on, to be illustrating. Because obviously all the images are out of my head, they're not out of Roger's head, as reactions to Roger's lyrics. Roger is the originator and the platform of the whole thing. But my drawings are out of my head, from my experiences really. My experiences as a child, my experiences with education and everything else he talks about in the film. So it was a strange marriage really and luckily Roger and I got on extremely well. He has a reputation for that not always being the case. We played a lot of snooker, which is like British pool, and then we drank a lot of strong beer and that's the way <i>The Wall</i> began to take shape. I would make little drawings, maybe eight inches by four inches, and stick them on my studio wall in Chelsea and London here and then we would move them around, saying, "What about putting that there?" So I was able to move these little sketches around and create a visual as well as a sonic track to the whole thing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Baltin: Looking back what was it that allowed you to get along so well?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scarfe: I think it was partly because they didn't interfere with my work. Roger has this philosophy, I keep using Roger because he was obviously the mainstay, but Nick [Mason] and David [Gilmour] and Rick [Wright] were all involved in this of course. But Roger was the one I communed with most and he had this philosophy of, "If you book an artist to do something, you get what that artist does. You don't try and change what that artist is doing." Because there is absolutely no point in booking him or hiring him if you're going to start messing around with what he wants to do. And of course that does happen frequently in the film world and many other worlds. Roger was incredibly kind of...I don't mean to say he didn't have an opinion, but he didn't enforce that opinion. He was just helpfully talk it over. In general he said, "I love it, I love it," which was a great atmosphere to work in. </p>
