      <h1>Popular Photographer Injured After Incident At Navan Racecourse</h1>

      <p>Popular racing photographer Pat Healy was injured in a freak accident at Navan Racecourse this afternoon after a horse crashed through the inside rail after passing the winning post.</p>
      <p>Thatsy and Entoucas were engaged in a fascinating finish at the Meath venue, hitting the line together and leaving the judge to decide on a winner. However, after the tight finish Entoucas crashed through the rail and collided with Healy who was positioned just outside the rail.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, it has been reported that Healy, a hugely popular figure among jockeys, trainers and other well-known figures in the industry, was conscious before being transferred to Blanchardstown Hospital for further tests.</p>
      <p>Frank Kenny, the doctor on duty at the track, said:</p>
      <blockquote>Pat was very stable leaving the course. We were very happy with him when he left. As regards injuries, they are probably down the right side of his chest. They are quite bad, but he is stable and he should make a full recovery</blockquote>
      <p>The Gordon Elliott-trained Thatsy, ridden by Davy Russell, was eventually declared the winner of the www.navanracecourse.ie Maiden Hurdle after edging out Entoucas in the photo finish. The Joseph O'Brien-trained runner and jockey Mark Walsh emerged from the incident relatively unscathed.</p>
