      <p>Clane Community Council recently acknowledged the work of Helen O'Flaherty as chairperson of the Clane Tidy Town Association (TTA).</p>
      <p>Helen, who has brothers living in Athy and Prosperous, just recently left the area to move to Enniscrone in Sligo, where she will live a four minute walk from the sea.</p>
      <p>She left Ireland in 1967 and returned in December 2012, having worked in the UK, Mid East and USA in the aviation sector - from cabin crew to airline management.</p>
      <p>She has lived in Clane since 2013 and quickly got involved in the volunteer Tidy Town Association. She was presented with flower by CCC chairman, Paul Carroll, as a thank you for her time. “They (TTA) need more manpower,” Helen told the Leader.</p>
