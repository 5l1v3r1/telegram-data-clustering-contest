      <p>The 19-year-old YouTube star said in a video that her family cars had been stolen, along with handbags and other items.</p>
      <p>Barker is thankful nobody was hurt in the break-in, with the home ransacked while her family slept in their beds.</p>
      <p>She said: “Me and my family are genuinely just so grateful that we’re all just safe.</p>
      <p>“That’s what obviously is most important</p>
      <p>“I’m so busy with dancing all the time that it’s kept my mind off it.”</p>

      <p>Barker said that during a difficult week, facing a dance-off and the burglary, she has remained at the family home.</p>
      <p>She has welcomed support from Strictly viewers and fans of her YouTube channel.</p>
      <p>The vlogger said: “We’re all still at home I’m so exhausted from dancing I just get home and sleep anyway.</p>
      <p>“It was never anything that was targeted at me.</p>
      <p>“It was the one night that our alarm wasn’t on. Obviously that is never going to happen again.</p>
      <p>“The support from everyone, from everyone that watches the show, from my fans, it’s definitely got us through.”</p>
      <p>Barker said that as well as taking her mind off the burglary, the gruelling Strictly schedule has distracted her from romance.</p>
      <p>She said: “I don’t really have time. I’m focusing all my time on Strictly.”</p>
      <p>In Saturday night’s show, Barker and her partner AJ Pritchard were at the bottom of the leaderboard following their samba to Walking On Sunshine by the Take Me To Rio Collective.</p>
      <p>They scored 26 points to put them in joint last place alongside Alex Scott and Neil Jones, and they are at risk of elimination.</p>
