      <p>The Philadelphia 76ers entered the 2019-20 NBA season with championship aspirations, but they've hardly looked like a title contender outside of short stretches throughout their first 15 games.On Saturday, they played their most complete game of the season while dismantling Jimmy Butler's Miami Heat in a 113-86 shellacking that wasn't as close as the final score might suggest.</p>
      <p>In Butler's first game back in Philadelphia since he fled to Miami in a sign-and-trade this summer, the Sixers put their foot on the Heat's throat from the get-go and never let up.</p>
      <p>Their first offensive possession <a href="https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&amp;GameID=0021900230&amp;GameEventID=8&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;title=MISS%20Richardson%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot">hardly inspired confidence</a>, but the ensuing trip down the floor set the tone for how the night would go. Ben Simmons picked Kendrick Nunn's pocket, corralled the ball in transition and flew past Heat center Meyers Leonard for an acrobatic layup.</p>
      <p>The Sixers quickly piled n from there, hitting five of their next six shots to force a quick timeout from Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra. That didn't stop the bleeding, though, as the Sixers jumped out to an early 26-6 lead, held Miami to 13 first-quarter points, and later entered halftime with a 20-point lead.</p>
      <p>Rather than allow the Heat to generate some momentum out of the locker room, the Sixers opened the third quarter on a 13-1 run, building a 68-36 lead that erased all doubt about who would emerge victorious on this night. Their lead swelled as high as 41 points early in the fourth quarter before both teams cleared their benches and allowed the third-stringers to run out the clock.</p>
      <p>It was a two-way tour de force against a Heat team that entered Saturday night with the second-best record in the Eastern Conference.</p>
      <p>In his first game against his former team, Sixers 2-guard Josh Richardson erupted for a season-high 32 points on 11-of-15 shooting, including 6-of-7 from deep. Joel Embiid chipped in 23 points, 11 rebounds, two steals and two blocks in 26 minutes, and Tobias Harris (19 points, eight rebounds), Al Horford (16 points, six rebounds) and Simmons (four points, eight rebounds, seven assists, four steals) gave the Heat zero reprieve.</p>
      <p>The Sixers did benefit from some unsustainably hot shooting. They tied their season high with 14 made three-pointers, and their 48.3 percent clip from deep was second only to the 50.0 percent they shot in the 100-97 loss to the Denver Nuggets on Nov. 8.</p>
      <p>However, they otherwise executed their championship formula to a T.</p>
      <p>Through the <a href="https://stats.nba.com/game/0021900230/?StartRange=0&amp;EndRange=21606&amp;RangeType=2">first three quarters</a>, they turned the ball over only nine times, outrebounded Miami 39-29 and mustered 10 steals. Limiting <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryantoporek/2019/11/14/careless-turnovers-might-be-philadelphia-76ers-undoing/">careless takeaways</a>, using their size advantage to pound the glass and wreaking defensive havoc to create easy transition opportunities will lead to wins more often than not.</p>
      <p>“When you can have a game plan and energy collide, you got a chance to defend,” Sixers head coach Brett Brown <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/w/1YqGodaowWAJv">told reporters</a> after the game. “You got a chance to really have a special defensive night. And I felt like we did some of those things.”</p>
      <p>It's unrealistic to expect the Sixers to muster this type of two-way effort every night during the regular season. Butler's return energized the home crowd more than a run-of-the-mill game against a bottom-feeder like the New York Knicks or Cleveland Cavaliers will. It's human nature for players to get worked up for prove-it games against potential contenders and look past lottery-bound squads.</p>
      <p>Luckily, the Sixers have another big test Monday as they head to Toronto to take on the Raptors, who knocked them out of last year's playoffs and are a half-game ahead of them in the Eastern Conference standings. While Kawhi Leonard is no longer there to torment them on both ends of the floor and hit series-ending four-bounce shots, the Sixers will assuredly enter that game with revenge on their minds.  </p>
      <p>The Sixers aren't likely to shoot as well from deep Monday against Toronto as they did Saturday against Miami, and they may not be as locked in defensively, either. They're bound to have more infuriating losses to lottery-bound teams as the season progresses, too.</p>
      <p>But Saturday's annihilation of the Heat was a stark reminder that when the Sixers are executing their A game, their championship aspirations aren't just empty words. If they can begin to replicate this type of effort more frequently as the year goes on, they’ll cement themselves as one of the top threats in the East.</p>
