      <p>India skipper Virat Kohli has rejected comparisons between his current Test squad and the all-conquering West Indies team of the 1970s, insisting there was a long way to go yet.</p>
      <p>India wrapped up yet another dominant showing when they became the first team ever to complete four successive innings victories in the five-day format, to finish off Bangladesh in their maiden pink-ball Test.  The win was India’s seventh consecutive Test victory - the most they have had in succession. </p>
      <p>Prior to the Bangladesh series, India beat West Indies 2-0 and registered a 3-0 whitewash over South Africa. The victory margins were 318 runs, 257 runs, 203 runs, an innings, and 137 runs, and an innings and 202 runs.  Despite dominating their opposition and a run-away lead at the top of the newly implemented ICC Test Championships, Kohli believes comparisons to the West Indies teams are premature.</p>
      <blockquote>“I can only say we are at the top of our game. You can’t judge a team’s dominance with seven games. You’re talking about a West Indies side which did it for 15 years,” Kohli said after the match.</blockquote>
      <p>“You can ask me this question when we all are close to retiring. How the decade has gone playing together ... Not after seven games. Seven years yes, but not seven games,” he added.</p>
      <p>“I think there is still time (to compare). But we are quite excited about the way we are playing and what the challenges are. Going forward, we will play in New Zealand now. The frame of mind is to get to the next series in Test cricket. It’s not like we are finished playing at home ... Let’s see what happens abroad.”</p>
