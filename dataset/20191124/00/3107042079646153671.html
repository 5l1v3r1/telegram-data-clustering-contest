      <p>About 30 environmental protesters have stormed an Austrian oil company's support ship in Timaru to prevent it leaving port.</p>

      <p>The Bahamas-flagged OMV was preparing to leave the Port of Timaru and travel north to the oil rig off the coast of Taranaki.</p>
      <p>Greenpeace said OMV was about to begin drilling three oil wells there.</p>

      <p>Police said they were called to the port at about 6am.</p>
      <p>They said officers were on site to ensure safety and to uphold the law while recognising the lawful right to protest.</p>
      <p>Climate and energy campaigner Amanda Larsson said those taking part in the occupation were prepared to stay overnight.</p>
      <p>"By occupying OMV's henchboat, we're delaying the monster rig from drilling for new oil in the middle of a climate emergency," she said.</p>
      <p>"OMV's oil rig is almost 50 nautical miles off the Taranaki Coast. Its remote location means it's nearly impossible for ordinary New Zealanders to take peaceful action to confront it directly.</p>
      <p>"We've brought the resistance here to disrupt its chain of support. We won't let this rig carry out its climate-destroying activities quietly, out of sight and mind."</p>
      <p>She said representatives from other environmental groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Oil Free Otago and 350 Aotearoa were also involved.</p>
