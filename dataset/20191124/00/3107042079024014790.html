      <p>A woman has been charged with murder over the death of two toddlers who were allegedly left for hours in a car at Logan, south of Brisbane.</p>
      <p>Paramedics were called to a home at Waterford West in Logan about 1.35pm on Saturday (local time) but were unable to revive the girls, aged one and two.</p>
      <p>Police say it appeared the sisters had died of exposure to extreme heat and they were attempting to establish how long they had been in a black station wagon parked in the front of the property.</p>
      <p>A 27-year-old Waterford West woman known to the girls was charged late on Saturday with two counts of murder, police said. She will appear at Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday.</p>
      <p>The Courier-Mail reports the woman is the children's mother.</p>
      <p>"The two children exhibited signs of being exposed to extreme heat and that is forming the direction of our investigation," Detective Inspector Mark White said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"We are speaking the parents of those children. It's a very tragic incident which has occurred."</p>
      <p>Police said they were offering support to officers who attended the scene which was described as "tragic".</p>
      <p>"We are putting a lot of emphasis on supporting our people," Detective Inspector White said.</p>
      <p>"One of our priorities in addition to conducting the investigation is the wellbeing of our staff and our other emergency service colleagues."</p>
