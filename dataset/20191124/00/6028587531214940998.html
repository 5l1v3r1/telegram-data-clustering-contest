      <p>Coworking is a booming business, with demand continuing to outstrip supply. But it’s also a sector under severe pressure as a result of over-extending itself. The world’s biggest industry player WeWork recently received a $1.5 billion rescue package from Softbank and abandoned its IPO plans. Last month U.K.-based Central Working collapsed into administration.What some of the bigger operators go wrong is with their property strategy. Beneath the hospitality element of coworking, it is very much a property business, and without the best locations and the right deals, operators can come unstuck.</p>
      <p>To succeed, coworking models need to be practical, distinctive and sustainable; the criteria that entrepreneurs David Kosky and Elliot Gold aimed to meet when they launched their coworking solution <a href="https://work.life/">Work.Life </a>in 2015.</p>
      <p>The company’s success has been based on a unique partnership-based property strategy for landlords and hospitality-focused offerings for members that has seen it work with some of the U.K.’s largest institutional landlords.</p>
      <p>The founders had met through mutual friends and both had left their jobs. Kosky had previously worked in finance, working for a London based asset management business, while Gold, who’d started his career in management consultancy, had moved to the public sector and the U.K. government’s Start Up Loans scheme. When they met, both were independently looking at the flex market for a potential business.</p>
      <p>Gold says: “My experience at Start Up Loans had led me into coworking. As part of the business startup support package, we were looking at workspace infrastructure and, in particular, at coworking.”</p>
      <p>As they worked on their new business idea they saw how impersonal most people’s workspace experiences were. “While it’s tempting to want to automate the workspace, the workspace is like any consumer experience; it’s about people and human connection,” says Kosky. “Right from the start, we wanted to build smaller communities to maximize opportunities for member connections and deliver a unique, personal service for our members.”</p>
      <p>A lot of competitors were taking space on the upper floors of buildings that could be anywhere. Work.Life would create spaces that connected with the outside world and gave a sense of the location; a quasi-retail brand that feels more like a mix between coffee shop and workspace.</p>
      <p>While most operators were focusing on taking larger amounts of space, potentially impacting property investment values, they focused on smaller locations with ground floor frontage that would enable them to animate landlords’ buildings without impacting investment values. This strategy was instrumental in their move away from the traditional lease liability model and towards partnerships with landlords.</p>
      <p>Kosky says: “We could see that more and more landlords wanted to have flex operators in their buildings. Our view was that eventually, the flex market would mirror that of the hotel sector where landlords would partner with operators for the right assets.”</p>
      <p>The business was launched from Gold’s apartment in London. Recognizing that investment would be easier to raise if they had secured their first property, they found their first location in Camden, north London, and went on to raise an initial £700,000, a mix of equity and debt. The location was filled within two months of opening.</p>
      <p>“There are multiple factors at play in employee workplace experience, and we realized early on the importance of delivering a personal, emotionally connecting customer experience for our members,” says Gold.</p>
      <p>Expansion into new locations followed quickly, boosted by the support of their initial investors who have continued to support the rollout over the past few years.</p>
      <p>The adoption of coworking by the larger institutional landlords, looking to operators like Work.Life to animate their buildings and attract bigger, traditional occupiers into the buildings, is becoming a major trend.</p>
      <p>Kosky says: “This move towards partnering with the right occupiers means that more intuitional landlords are preferring management agreements and turnover deals versus straight leases as they look to share the upsides with the coworking operators.”</p>
      <p>Another emerging trend is growing demand for flex space from SMEs and larger businesses. “Enquiries from businesses with more than 50 employees grew by 20% last year and we expect to see continued growth in the enterprise space,” he adds.</p>
      <p>Work.Life is about to launch an operating platform for landlords looking to provide a customer-centric and Capex-efficient managed solution, but who don’t have the capability or capacity to take on the operational burden.</p>
      <p>“The platform will attract a premium return for landlords by reducing marketing voids and attracting a significant uplift over traditional lease income,” says Gold. “It is a demand-led, low-risk solution for landlords, while for businesses, the platform bridges the gap between coworking and leased workspace, giving them all the benefits of coworking but with their own front door.”</p>
      <p>With 10 U.K. locations already in operation Work.Life plans to open a further eight by the end of 2020. The business employs 50 people and expects to turn over £21 million ($27 million) in this financial year. Its five-year plan is to leverage the operational platform and joint venture with a major UK agent and enter international markets.</p>
