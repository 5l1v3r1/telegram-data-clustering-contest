        <b>Goalkeeper Rune Jarstein was sent off as Hertha Berlin continued to sputter in the Bundesliga, losing 4-0 at Augsburg on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Hertha </b>lost a <b>fifth straight game </b>and slid below <b>Augsburg </b>after <b>Philipp Max, Sergio Cordova, Andre Hahn and Florian Niederlechner</b> scored for the hosts. Hertha are just <b>a point above the relegation zone.</b></p>
      <p>Left-back Max <b>opened the scoring</b> for the Bavarians in the <b>18th minute </b>with a free-kick but the turning point came 10 minutes later.</p>
      <p><b>Jarstein earned a red card </b>with a studs-up challenge on Niederlechner.<b> Cordova</b> claimed the home side's second in the process.</p>
      <p>Substitute Hahn added a<b> third in the 52nd minute </b>with a superb curling strike from the edge of the box. <b>Niederlechner bagged his side's fourth </b>in the 79th minute.</p>

      <p>Earlier on Sunday, <b>Borussia Dortmund's squad were booed </b>and jeered when they appeared at the side's annual general meeting, with fans screaming <b>"shame on you".</b></p>
      <p>Coach<b> Lucien Favre is under pressure </b>as Dortmund, expected to challenge for the title after an ambitious off-season recruitment drive, languish in sixth after a draw to lowly Paderborn on Friday.</p>
      <p>On Saturday managerless <b>Bayern Munich closed the gap at the top of the table</b> to just a point with a 4-0 romp at <b>Fortuna Duesseldorf</b> as leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach suffered a shock 2-0 loss at Union Berlin. </p>
      <p>In Sunday's late game, <b>struggling Mainz head to Hoffenheim</b> who can move fourth with a sixth straight win.</p>
