      <h1>44 schools in the red over Kannada</h1>

      <p>The Department of Public Instructions that inspects schools has found out that 44 schools in the city from all Boards of Studies- including CBSE and ICSE - are not teaching Kannada as a language. The officials will file a report on this to send to the government to take action. The big question is whether these schools will face disaffiliation. <br/><br/>Earlier the Kannada Development Authority (KDA) had submitted a report giving out the list of 40 city schools that are not teaching Kannada as first or second language. Based on the report, Minister of Education S Suresh Kumar ordered an inquiry and asked the officials to re-visit these schools and give another report on this. <br/><br/>A senior official from the department said, “We re-visited all these schools and they do not offer Kannada as first or second language at all. We will be compiling the report and sending it to the government and then action will be initiated. While we cannot reveal the names of the schools now, we can say that there are CBSE and ICSE schools in this list.” <br/><br/><br/>Earlier in a press meet, Kumar said, “If the schools are shown to violate the Act, the officials will recommend for their disaffiliation.” <br/>The KDA report said that as per the Act, it’s compulsory for every school in Karnataka to teach Kannada as first or second language. But some schools have violated the Act. <br/><br/><b>Is disaffiliation possible?<br/></b><br/>Experts say that no school can be disaffiliated in the middle of an academic year. Some officials are mulling that whatever action is initiated can be applicable from the next academic year. An official said, “We have to withdraw Non-Objection-Certificate for these schools, but the problem is that it is just three months away from the board exams not just for State syllabus, even for the CBSE and ICSE schools. The other point is, as of now we can issue a show-cause notice to these schools in the interest of students, but tell the schools that they need to teach Kannada from next June or else the school will be denied NOC.”</p>
