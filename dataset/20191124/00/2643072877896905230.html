      <h1>Arsenal Chairman Set To Resign Over Unai Emery’s Continued Stay As Manager</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/23/epl-arsenal-need-intelligent-english-players-pires/"><u><b>Arsenal</b></u></a> chairman Sir Chips Keswick is reportedly considering leaving the board over Unai Emery’s continued reign at the North London club.</p>
      <p>The Gunners failed to win yet again in the Premier League on Saturday, escaping with a 2-2 draw at home to Southampton thanks to a brace from Alexandre Lacazette.</p>
      <p>Arsenal who are seventh on the table have not won in the league since beating Bournemouth at the start of October.</p>
      <p>Fans and pundits have called on Arsenal to sack <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/12/epl-arsenal-chiefs-meet-staff-over-unai-emerys-future/"><u><b>Unai Emery</b></u></a> so as to save the club from further disgrace.</p>
      <p>According to The Athletic, Sir Chips – who has been chairman since taking over from Peter Hill-Wood in 2013 – felt ‘compelled’ to consider handing in his resignation.</p>
      <p>Technical director Edu and head of football Raul Sanllehi are the two key players in Arsenal’s hierarchy now and intend to give Emery more time before reassessing his position.</p>
      <p>Managing director Vinai Venkatesham, chief negotiator Huss Fahmy and Josh Kroenke, son of owner Stan, make up the decision-making group, with Sir Chips having been sidelined with virtually no say in Emery’s future.</p>
      <p>Should the 79-year-old, who is a lifelong Arsenal fan, walk away from the club it would end a long association with the Gunners, having first become a director back in 2005.</p>
      <p>Emery is believed to have three more Premier League games to turn Arsenal’s season around – against Norwich, Brighton and West Ham – and any further slip-ups could see him axed.</p>
