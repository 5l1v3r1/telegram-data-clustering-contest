      <h1>Lewis Capaldi, Stormzy and Ed Sheeran take on Tones and I for Number 1</h1>
      <h2>Plus new entries for Digdat x D-Block Europe and Partynextdoor, and climbs for Arizona Zervas, Jax Jones and Endor.</h2>

      <p>Could <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/51369/lewis-capaldi/">Lewis Capaldi</a> be within grasp of a second UK Number 1 single before the year is out?</p>
      <p>The 2019 Scottish breakthrough star goes head-to-head with reigning chart topper <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/dance-monkey-how-australian-busker-tones-and-i-scored-a-global-hit__27054/">Tones &amp; I and her global chart smash Dance Monkey</a> in this week’s Official Singles Chart race. Before You Go is up 17 places to Number 2 and trails by just 1000 chart sales after the first 48 hours, can the self-styled "America's Sweetheart" overtake Tones &amp; I before Friday? It’s one of two Capaldi tracks heading for this week’s Top 5; Bruises (5) is up one place since last week.</p>
      <p>Here's a little reminder of what happened the last time Lewis Capaldi sniffed chart-topping glory...</p>

      <p>Stormzy and Ed Sheeran are just behind and look set to bag the week’s highest new entry – their collaboration with Burna Boy, Own It, taken from Stormzy’s forthcoming album, Heavy Is The Head (out December 13) enters at Number 3 on today’s First Look Top 20.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere, newcomer <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/who-is-arizona-zervas-the-roxanne-rapper-climbing-the-charts-after-tiktok-popularity__27783/">Arizona Zervas</a> is continuing his rise up the Official Chart and on course for a personal best this week. The Maryland US singer/rapper whose popularity has risen with the help of video sharing site Tik Tok, is up two places to Number 8.</p>
      <p>Jax Jones and Ella Henderson could be looking at a new peak this week too – This Is Real is currently up 6 places to Number 14.</p>
      <p>Lewisham rapper/songwriter Digdat may also enjoy a personal best on the Official Chart this week if new entry New Dior featuring D Block Europe (17) maintains its position through until Friday. See <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/54172/digdat/">where Digdat's previous songs have charted</a>.</p>
      <p>A similar story for <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/30615/partynextdoor/">Partynextdoor</a> – the Canadian writer/rapper/producer is on track for his first Top 20 as a lead artist, teaming up with Drake on new single Loyal, a new entry at 18.</p>
      <p>And finally, the Defected-signed rising Brighton producer <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/56351/endor/">Endor</a> looks set for yet another big climb - dance-floor anthem Pump It Up may break the Top 20 for the first time this week following a six-week unbroken ascent up the Official Chart, up 9 places to Number 20 after two days.</p>
      <p>Tune in to BBC Radio 1's The Official Chart with Scott Mills this Friday from 4pm to hear the Top 40 countdown. The full <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/">Official Singles Chart Top 100</a> will be published here on OfficialCharts.com from 5.45pm.</p>
