        <p>DEVILS DOWN DUCKS</p>
        <p>Oregon’s College Football Playoff bid is over.</p>
        <p>Freshman Jayden Daniels completed 22 of 32 passes for 408 yards and three touchdowns and Arizona State intercepted two of Justin Herbert’s passes in the fourth quarter, helping the Sun Devils upset the No. 6 Ducks 31-28.</p>
        <p>Arizona State ended Oregon’s CFP hopes and its nine-game winning streak. The Sun Devils snapped a four-game losing streak with their first victory over a top-five team since Oct. 14, 2017, against then No. 5 Washington.</p>
        <p>Oregon has clinched the Pac-12 North title and a place in the conference championship game.</p>
        <p>The Sun Devils held on after Oregon scored three touchdowns in a 6:38 span in the wild fourth quarter.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>BUCKEYES OUTLAST NITTANY LIONS</p>
        <p>After cruising through the first 10 games against teams that didn’t put up much a fight, No. 2 Ohio State found itself in a slugfest with No. 9 Penn State.</p>
        <p>The Buckeyes responded, winning with defense.</p>

        <p>J.K. Dobbins rushed for 157 yards and two touchdowns, and Justin Fields threw for 188 yards and two scores for Ohio State.</p>
        <p>Ohio State held on after Penn State took advantage of two second-half turnovers to climb back in the game after trailing 21-0. This was a far different scenario for Ohio State, which hadn’t yet had to play hard into the second half.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>STRANGE GAME</p>
        <p>Yale and Harvard students poured out of the stands together at halftime in a climate change protest that delayed the 136th edition of The Game for about an hour.</p>
        <p>When the fans stormed back onto the field at the end, it was only the Yalies, and they were celebrating this time.</p>
        <p>Kurt Rawlings threw two touchdown passes in the final 88 seconds of regulation to rally Yale from a 17-point fourth-quarter deficit and beat Harvard 50-43 in two overtimes, one of the strangest editions of The Game in its 144 years of history.</p>
        <p>Following a halftime sit-in by a couple hundred protesters who occupied midfield for about an hour before being peacefully escorted off by police, the Bulldogs celebrated a conference title in darkness 15 minutes after sunset in the unlit, 105-year-old Yale Bowl.</p>
