      <p><i>BSY in strategy mode after indications that party could win just 6 seats</i> <br/><br/>An internal survey done by the BJP in the 15 Assembly Constituencies going for polls has indicated a tough fight.A source said that the BJP could end up winning just six, two short of a comfortable majority. <br/><br/>After the survey reports, Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa is said to have been closeted with a few of his close associates and a few media managers to restrategise the electioneering besides making a fervent appeal to the community religious heads to help him continue in power by winning at least 10 seats. <br/>The Chief Minister has already assigned specific constituencies to each of the Ministers with a condition that their continuation in the government is linked to victory of BJP candidates in the byelections. He is also said to be asking leaders to catch hold of local vote bank leaders and do whatever it takes to retain them in the party so that there is no surprises in the polls. <br/><br/>A source said that an internal survey is said to have indicated a tough fight in Gokak, Hunsuru, Hoskote, Ranebennur, KR Pete, Chikkaballapur and Yeshwantpur. <br/>In Gokak, the BJP has fielded disqualified MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi while the Congress has nominated the youngest of the Jarkiholi brothers, Lakkan. Though observers in Belagavi feel the Jarkiholis will have internal understanding, the fight appears to have intensified following serious differences between former minister Satish Jarkiholi and his eldest brother (Ramesh). Added to this, BJP’s defeated candidate Ashok Poojari, a Lingayat, has contested on a JD(S) ticket. Poojari has the potential to split the Lingayat votes, which could go against the BJP’s interests. <br/><br/>In Hoskote, the BJP has more reasons to worry as Sharath Bacheche Gowda, son of Lok Sabha member BN Bacheche Gowda is contesting as an independent. He is backed by the JD(S), which has helped Vokkaliga caste consolidation in his favour. Besides Sharath, the Congress has fielded Padmavathi, wife of Hebbal MLA B Suresh. Her candidature is said to have caused a split in the Kuruba community votes. With Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah taking a keen interest in the elections here, BJP’s MTB Nagaraj has an uphill task. <br/><br/>In Yeshwantpur too, the BJP is facing an uphill task, where JD(S)’ Javarayi Gowda, who had lost by a few thousand votes in 2018, is hoping to take revenge. Disqualified MLA ST Somashekhar contesting on a BJP ticket, however, has got backing of the local Congress corporators. But he might not be able to get the considerable minority votes, which could prove to be detrimental to his electoral prospects. The JD(S) is also making an effort to consolidate the Vokkaliga vote bank in the largest Assembly Constituency in Karnataka. <br/><br/>In Hunsuru, the Congress is giving a tough fight as Siddaramaiah has taken it personally to defeat the disqualified MLA AH Vishwanath of the BJP. The JD(S) is going all out to defeat Vishwanath, who deserted the party and switched to the BJP. <br/><br/>In Chikkaballapur, BJP is depending on disqualified MLA and its candidate K Sudhakar as the party has no considerable presence. The JD(S) and the Congress have fielded Vokkaliga candidates with deep pockets making Sudhkar to work hard to get a hatrick victory. Congress’ DK Shivakumar and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy have taken keen interest to defeat the BJP. One cannot rule out possibility of an understanding between the two in the last minute to defeat common enemy Sudhakar. In KR Pete, disqualified MLA KC Narayana Gowda is swimming against the Vokkaliga tide. The JD(S) that still has a big presence here is giving him a run for his money. <br/><br/><i>Savadi will continue: BSY</i> <br/><br/>Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi will continue in his post for the full term, Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa said in Athani (Belagavi). Addressing an election rally campaigning for Mahesh Kumtalli, Yediyurappa said: “Savadi will continue as DyCM for the next three and half years. Our party national president (Amit Shah) has promised it.”</p>
