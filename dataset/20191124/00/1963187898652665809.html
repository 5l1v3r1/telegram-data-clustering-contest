      <p>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp explained why he did not gave the chance to Mohamed Salah against Crystal Palace. <br/><br/>Liverpool snatched a hard victory over Crystal Palace 2-1, a match that saw Salah stay on the bench. <br/><br/>"Salah is fine," Klopp said after the match. <br/><br/>He added during his press conference: "But he could not train for nine days, first joined the camp of Egypt, and then went to his home and trained by 60% to 70% the day before yesterday." <br/><br/>"Yesterday was his first 100% full training, and then we had to decide whether to start it or not." <br/><br/>"We decided to keep him on the bench, and we wanted to get him in the final minutes as I noticed, but then we scored a goal." <br/><br/>"We were able to comfort him today and this is good. He will be back in Wednesday's game." <br/><br/>Liverpool will face Napoli on Wednesday in the fifth round of the Champions League group stage. <br/><br/>Salah missed Egypt's qualifiers in the 2021 African Nations Cup qualifiers against Kenya and the Comoros with a last international pause. <br/><br/>Salah has suffered from ankle pain in the last period, and his recent participation with Liverpool is due to face Manchester City just before the international stop.</p>
