      <p>Emirates has launched a new A380 livery celebrating the UAE’s ambitions to become a hub for space exploration and research.</p>
      <p>The one-off ‘UAE in Space’ livery pays tribute to the nation’s first space mission earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Emirati astronaut and former pilot Hazzaa Al Mansoori <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-49715269"><b>embarked on an eight-day mission to the International Space Station in September</b></a>.</p>

      <p>The superjumbo made its first commercial flight sporting the new livery to Melbourne this week, and will fly across the carrier’s network over the next year.</p>
      <p>The livery depicts an image of an astronaut in space, with Earth in the background, along with the words “The sky is only the beginning”, a quote from His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, vice president of the UAE and ruler of Dubai.</p>
      <p>The ‘UAE in Space’ livery is the latest design to adorn one of Emirates’ A380 aircraft – previous examples have included <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2017/11/03/emirates-celebrates-delivery-100th-a380/"><b>a commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of the UAE’s founding father</b></a> HH Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, and <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2017/04/10/emirates-unveils-ac-milan-a380-livery/"><b>a football-themed superjumbo featuring five AC Milan players in action</b></a>.</p>
