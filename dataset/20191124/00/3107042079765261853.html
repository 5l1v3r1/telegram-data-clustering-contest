      <p>Given the dry conditions around Dunedin at present, St Kilda firefighters were quick to attend a vegetation fire in Macandrew Bay this afternoon.</p>
      <p>A Fire and Emergency New Zealand spokesman said vegetation covering about 40sqm was on fire about 5.30pm, but by the time the fire crew arrived, it had been reduced to some "smouldering trees" at the back of a farm block in Wharfdale St.</p>
      <p>He said no property was in danger from the fire, and it was extinguished within 90 minutes.</p>
