      <p>The teenage performer will be reunited with her coach on Strictly Come Dancing, with the young star set to claim her prize and perform.</p>
      <p>Fergusson has watched the show since she was two, and is supporting her coach and Kelvin Fletcher this series.</p>
      <p>She said she was happy to return to school following an intense time on The Greatest Dancer.</p>
      <p>The young star said: “I’m still at school and dancing as normal.</p>
      <p>“I was straight back to school the day after I won it.</p>
      <p>“I was kind of looking forward to it, because it had been such a busy period. I kind of wanted to get back to normal after being on a high for so long.”</p>
      <p>Fergusson will work with Mabuse again when she joins the Strictly team this Sunday, and will have some nerves, although she knows how to cope with her pre-show tension.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s what I love to do. It’s my favourite part. I just like gong out there and enjoying it.</p>
      <p>“I’m always nervous, I always get butterflies. But I always get adrenaline, that kicks in and excites me more.”</p>
      <p>Strictly airs tonight on BBC One at 7.15pm.</p>
