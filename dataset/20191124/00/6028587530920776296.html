      <p>The Green Bay Packers and San Francisco 49ers have had some epic matchups in the last quarter century.They’ve met in the playoffs seven times since 1995, with Green Bay holding a 4-3 edge. They’ve battled for homefield advantage in the postseason on a handful of occasions. And overall, Green Bay is 15-5 against San Francisco in that stretch.</p>
      <p>These traditional NFC powers will write the latest chapter in their memorable rivalry Sunday at 7:20 p.m. CST when they meet in one of the biggest games of the year.</p>
      <p>San Francisco (9-1) hosts Green Bay (8-2) in a contest that will play an enormous role in determining the conference’s top seed come January. Here’s a look at each positional group and which team has the edge.</p>
      <p>
        <b>QUARTERBACKS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers is having a bounceback season, with 17 touchdowns, two interceptions and a 102.7 passer rating.</p>
      <p>For the ninth time in his career, Rodgers faces the team he idolized as a child — the same one that bypassed him in the 2005 NFL Draft. To date, Rodgers is 4-4 in those games, but 0-2 against the 49ers in the playoffs.</p>
      <p>San Francisco’s Jimmy Garoppolo has a remarkable 17-3 career record (.850). Garoppolo is also 15-3 with the 49ers since he was traded to San Francisco in Oct., 2017.</p>
      <p>Garoppolo has thrown 18 touchdown passes this year, 10 interceptions and has a solid 97.7 quarterback rating. Garoppolo still has plenty of doubters, but will get a chance to prove those people wrong as the 49ers face a loaded schedule down the stretch.</p>
      <p>“Jimmy … makes a lot of plays, and he keeps coming,” 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said this week. “He's not scared to turn it over, because he's not scared to make the big play. But also the more he plays, the better looks we can give him. We've definitely got to cut down on those turnovers.”</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> Packers</p>
      <p>
        <b>RUNNING BACKS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Green Bay’s Aaron Jones ranks fifth in the NFC and 14<sup>th</sup> in the NFL in rushing yards (589). Jones and Carolina’s Christian McCaffrey are also tied for the NFL lead with 14 total touchdowns. And Jones’ 14 touchdowns through 10 games are tied for the second-most in team history behind only Don Hutson (17 in 1942).</p>
      <p>Packers’ No. 2 running back Jamaal Williams leads Green Bay with five receiving touchdowns and is averaging 4.5 yards per carry on his 65 attempts.</p>
      <p>Jones and Williams are the only running back tandem in the NFL to both have at least three-plus receiving TDs this season. And Green Bay’s 13 rushing touchdowns is tied for fourth in the NFL.</p>
      <p>“We feel like we have the best 1-2 punch in the league,” Jones told reporters this week.</p>
      <p>San Francisco ranks No. 2 in the league in rushing yards per game (149.0). The 49ers have also run the ball a whopping 52.3% of the time, which ranks second in the league behind only Baltimore (55.0%).</p>
      <p>Matt Breida leads the 49ers with 542 rushing yards, but is doubtful with an ankle injury. That means San Francisco will lean on ex-Falcon Tevin Coleman (409 yards, 5 TDs) and Raheem Mostert (5.2 yards per carry).</p>
      <p>Coleman runs with a violent style, even though he’s just 5-foot-11, 206 pounds. Mostert, who went undrafted back in 2015, ran a 4.38 40-yard dash at his pro day.</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> Packers</p>
      <p>
        <b>RECEIVERS</b>
      </p>
      <p>San Francisco’s top three targets in the passing game — tight end George Kittle (knee/ankle), and wideouts Emmanuel Sanders (ribs) and Deebo Samuel (shoulder) — are all listed as questionable. All three will be game-time decisions, but considering the magnitude of the game, it would be a surprise if any of them sit.</p>
      <p>“I think you always plan for their top players,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. “Then if they’re not in there, you adjust.”</p>
      <p>Kittle has developed into arguably the top tight end in football not named Travis Kelce. Kittle has 134 receptions and more than 1,900 receiving yards in his last 24 games.</p>
      <p>The 49ers acquired Sanders, a two-time Pro Bowler, on Oct. 22 to provide a deep threat to their offense. Sanders, 32, has 581 career catches and 41 TDs.</p>
      <p>"The first thing you notice is how explosive he is,” LaFleur said of Sanders. “We knew that from really a long time ago. But he's really explosive.”</p>
      <p>Samuel stepped up in recent weeks when injuries hit the 49ers hard. Samuel, a rookie second-round draft pick, is a terrific route runner who’s already playing well beyond his years.</p>
      <p>Green Bay continues to search for a complement to Pro Bowler Davante Adams.</p>
      <p>Second-year man Marquez Valdes-Scantling has been shutout the last two games and played just 11 snaps Sunday. Geronimo Allison is averaging a pedestrian 9.2 yards on his 23 catches.</p>
      <p>Allen Lazard has shown flashes with 18 catches for 220 yards (12.2), but is best suited to be a No. 3 or 4 wideout. And tight end Jimmy Graham (27-310-3) has seen better days.</p>
      <p>“I love just the whole rotation that we've got going on,” Packers offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett said of his wideouts. “Whoever's rolling, you wanna make sure they keep getting it.</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> 49ers</p>
      <p>
        <b>OFFENSIVE LINE</b>
      </p>
      <p>San Francisco standout left tackle Joe Staley, a six-time Pro Bowler, won't play due to a finger injury. Rookie Justin Skule, a sixth round pick in April, was so-so earlier in the season when Staley was out with a broken leg. Skule gave up four sacks in seven games, but is a fierce competitor.</p>
      <p>Second-year right tackle Mike McGlinchey, the ninth overall pick in the 2018 draft, ranked as the No. 2 run-blocker at his position last season. McGlinchey has continued to shine this season, ranking among the top pass blockers in football.</p>
      <p>Center Weston Richburg, a former New York Giant, signed a five-year, $47.5 million deal in March, 2018. Richburg graded out as the 49ers’ worst starting offensive lineman last year, but he’s been among the top pass-blocking centers in football this year.</p>
      <p>Left guard Laken Tomlinson, a former Detroit Lion, has played his best football in San Francisco since arriving in 2017. And journeyman right guard Mike Person has allowed just one sack in 706 snaps.</p>
      <p>Packers tackles David Bakhtiari and Bryan Bulaga have faced a murderer’s row of pass rushers this year and held up remarkably well. The two will have to be at their best Sunday for Green Bay’s offense to function properly.</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> Even</p>
      <p>
        <b>DEFENSIVE LINE</b>
      </p>
      <p>San Francisco standout defense end Dee Ford (6.5 sacks, two forced fumbles), who was acquired for a second round draft pick from Kansas City last offseason, is out with a hamstring injury. Fortunately for the 49ers, defensive line is the deepest position on their roster.</p>
      <p>Rookie end Nick Bosa (7.0 sacks), the No. 2 overall pick in April, is a frontrunner for Defensive Rookie of the Year honors. Bosa is sculpted like a Greek God, has a motor than never quits and has defeated single blocks all year.</p>
      <p>“Obviously Nick is just getting going, but he's a force off the edge,” Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said.</p>
      <p>End Arik Armstead, a first round draft pick in 2015, is having a breakout year. Armstead never totaled more than 3.0 sacks in a season, but leads the 49ers with 8.0 sacks and has been San Francisco’s best run defender up front.</p>
      <p>Defensive tackle DeForest Buckner, a Pro Bowler last season, has 17.0 sacks since the start of 2018. At 6-foot-7, his combination of power and length are tough to deal with inside.</p>
      <p>Fellow tackle D.J. Jones is more of a plugger, while end Solomon Thomas — the No. 3 overall pick in the 2017 draft — provides depth.</p>
      <p>If the 49ers do have an Achilles’ heel, it’s stopping the run.</p>
      <p>The 49ers rank just 20<sup>th</sup> in rushing yards allowed per game (110.5) and 25<sup>th</sup> in yards allowed per carry (4.7). In the last four games, opponents are averaging 141.3 rushing yards per game and 5.59 yards per carry.</p>
      <p>“They’re going to rush the passer, regardless of the situation,” Packers right tackle Bryan Bulaga said. “The way they play, they play the pass and react to the run. That’s the way they play up front. They’re aggressive as hell.”</p>
      <p>Green Bay ranks 25<sup>th</sup> in rushing yards allowed per game (126.9) and 27<sup>th</sup> in yards allowed per carry (4.8). The Packers have allowed at least 120 rushing yards to seven teams, and five teams have exceeded 149 yards.</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> 49ers</p>
      <p>
        <b>LINEBACKERS</b>
      </p>
      <p>San Francisco middle linebacker Fred Warner, a second-year player from BYU, has been a starter since Day 1. Warner tied for first in total run stops among rookie linebackers a season ago (35) and has been steady again in 2019.</p>
      <p>Weakside linebacker Dre Greenlaw (5-11, 237) is an undersized, run and chase player. Sam ‘backer Azeer Al-Shaair went undrafted in April, but has worked his way onto the field thanks to his range and quickness.</p>
      <p>The NFL didn’t begin recording sacks as an official statistic until 1982.</p>
      <p>In the time since, just once have the Packers had two players record double digit sacks in the same season. That came in 1993, when the great Reggie White notched 13.0 sacks and Bryce Paup had 11.0.</p>
      <p>White and Paup could get company as early as Sunday, though. Packers outside linebacker Preston Smith has 10.0 sacks, while fellow outside linebacker Za’Darius Smith has 8.5 sacks.</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> Packers</p>
      <p>
        <b>SECONDARY</b>
      </p>
      <p>San Francisco ranks No. 1 in passing yards allowed per game (142.5) and No. 2 in opponent quarterback rating (72.3).</p>
      <p>Cornerback Richard Sherman, a Packer nemesis for years, has lost a step from his Seattle days. Still, Sherman continues to operate at an extremely high level and leads the 49ers with three interceptions.</p>
      <p>Fellow corner Ahkello Witherspoon was playing sensational football before suffering a foot injury in Week 3. Witherspoon played just six snaps in his return last week, but figures to be in the starting lineup against Green Bay.</p>
      <p>Emmanuel Moseley filled in admirably for Witherspoon, posting a 70% success rate, which ranks third in the NFL.</p>
      <p>Free safety Jimmie Ward is tough to beat in the deep middle and has limited big plays all season. Strong safety Jaquiski Tartt has played near a Pro Bowl level all year.</p>
      <p>Green Bay ranks 23<sup>rd</sup> in passing yards allowed per game (257.8). But Green Bay is seventh in interceptions (nine) and 13<sup>th</sup> in opponent quarterback rating (88.3).</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> 49ers</p>
      <p>
        <b>SPECIAL TEAMS</b>
      </p>
      <p>San Francisco return man Richie James has been pedestrian, averaging 8.9 yards per punt return and 18.8 yards on kickoffs.</p>
      <p>49ers veteran kicker Robbie Gould has missed the last three games with a quadriceps injury and will be a game-time decision. If Gould can’t go, rookie Chase McLaughlin who is 10-of-14 (71.4%), will handle the kicking duties.</p>
      <p>Punter Mitch Wishnowsky is 11<sup>th</sup> in net yardage (42.1).</p>
      <p>Packers punter JK Scott has hit a rough patch coinciding with decreasing temperatures. In the last three games, Scott is averaging a pedestrian 36.3 yards per punt with a net of just 34.7.</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> 49ers</p>
      <p>
        <b>COACHING</b>
      </p>
      <p>Packers head coach Matt LaFleur and 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan became close when they worked together in Houston, Washington and Atlanta.</p>
      <p>Shanahan, the son of two-time Super Bowl winning coach Mike Shanahan, was the offensive coordinator in Houston in 2008-‘09. LaFleur was an offensive assistant with the Texans those same years.</p>
      <p>Shanahan became the offensive coordinator for his father in Washington from 2010-’13, then held that same position on Dan Quinn’s staff in Atlanta from 2015-’16. Each time, LaFleur was on the staff as the quarterbacks coach.</p>
      <p>LaFleur’s brother, Mike, is the 49ers’ passing game coordinator today. And San Francisco defensive coordinator Robert Saleh and Matt LaFleur are extremely tight.</p>
      <p>“Oh, there’s so many things that I learned from him,” LaFleur said of Shanahan. “But, I think it’s just his detailed approach that he takes every day.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s a guy that has a great vision for what he wants to get done, how to use players, how to adapt and, you know, put people in the right position. A lot of my football philosophy has been shaped by him.”</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> 49ers</p>
      <p><b>Prediction:</b> 49ers 27, Packers 23</p>
