      <h3>Marcus Rashford believes that he won’t peak in form for Manchester United for another “four or five” years.</h3>
      <p>The 22-year-old is widely considered to be one of England’s finest young attacking talents and he has been a regular fixture in the first team at Old Trafford for the last few seasons.</p>
      <p>Rashford has been in decent form for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men so far this season, scoring six goals and making three assists in 12 Premier League games for the Red Devils.</p>
      <p>He has also netted once in the Europa League for Solskjaer’s side as he looked to help the Red Devils enjoy a successful first full season under the Norwegian head coach.</p>
      <p>Rashford still has the best years of his career ahead of him, and the England international feels that there is plenty more to come from him in the coming seasons.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/manchester-united/story/3995005/manchester-united-havent-seen-the-best-of-me-marcus-rashford">ESPN</a>, Rashford said: “In reality, my peak is not going to be for another four or five years. As good as things are now, they can only get better.”</p>
      <p>Rashford also insisted that the experience he already has at the top level will stand him in good stead for the future.</p>
      <p>He continued: “I just use these experiences now in my favour to better me in the future, because I know when I’m 25, 26, 27, they’re the years when I’m going to be playing my best football.</p>
      <p>“I’m just looking ahead to those times really and improving as much as I can until then.”</p>
      <p>Rashford will be expecting to feature for Manchester United when the Red Devils take on Sheffield United away from home in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.</p>
