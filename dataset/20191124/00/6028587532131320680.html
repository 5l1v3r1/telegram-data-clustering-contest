      <h1>One App Is Helping Thousands Of Book Clubs Organize In The Digital Age</h1>

      <p>If you’re trying to get a book club off the ground, picking the right medium can be tough. Email chain, Facebook group, or group chat? They’re all a bit unwieldly. For thousands of books clubs, there’s a clear winner: <a href="https://bookclubz.com/">Bookclubz</a>. The free management service helps users with all the pesky logistics of how to set up and maintain a book club with a group of book-loving friends. The website has been around since 2015, but the app version just launched on iOS and Android last week. Today, 5,700 clubs use Bookclubz, with nearly 27,000 individual members in total.</p>
      <p>Bookclubz’s three cofounders – Anna Ford, Ian Campbell, and Nancy Brown – keep the service free with a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/bookclubz">fundraising page</a> on Patreon and an affiliate partnership with Amazon for the books that users purchase through the app.</p>

      <p>It’s a smart tool. If there’s anything that can kill a book club, it’s the inevitable schedule clashes and even small-scale drama that can spring up among the members, and a service that can keep the lines of communication open is the best solution.</p>
      <p>It’s poised for more success, too. Going into 2020, our media world of endless TV show debuts and hamster-wheel news cycles is increasingly frenetic. Book clubs offer an escape to a more intentional experience. As a result, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamrowe1/2018/12/17/book-clubs-are-thriving-in-the-internet-era/">book clubs are on the rise</a>.</p>
      <p>On the one hand, the book itself offers a physical, finite form of media that won’t autoplay the next episode or feed you a steady drip of social media dopamine. On the other hand, the internet’s ability to connect people can help form the actual communities that create the clubs in the first place.</p>
      <p>I talked with two of the Bookclubz cofounders, Anna Ford and Nancy Brown, in a joint written interview covering what the app does and how it all got started.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How can a book club get started with the app?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's very simple! Download the Bookclubz app from the app store, or go to Bookclubz.com to "create your club." Once you create your club, you'll be able to simply and immediately invite all of your members to join. Once your members join via the invitation link emailed to them, you can manage your members and your club's operations all from one place.</p>
      <p>Once set up, you can use Bookclubz to manage members, send messages, poll your members for scheduling and book selection, post meetings, track RSVPs, upload photos and documents, keep a library of your club's reading history, and get recommendations for your next read! </p>
      <p>
        <b>How does it help them?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bookclubz is an online management tool for book clubs, the "team app" for Book Club. We know that book clubs bring people together and make books come alive through the exchange of ideas, perspectives, and dialogue. Bookclubz helps book clubs get organized, so they can focus on their mission and stay together longer.</p>
      <p>A book club is a cherished activity, but many clubs disband due to disorganization (Email chains are unruly and become awkward if a member leaves, Facebook groups require members to be on Facebook, but many are leaving. There is no way to share a history of books read with new members. Scheduling meetings and selecting books are the most difficult logistics to manage.) Bookclubz takes care of book club logistics, saves club leaders and members time, which allows clubs to focus on reading and discussing books. We're putting book club back on the calendar, for good!</p>
      <p>
        <b>What led you to start the app?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 2015, cofounder Anna Ford's book club was struggling with organization, attendance, and waning membership. With the help of cofounder Ian Campbell, she built Bookclubz as an organizational tool for her club. Hundreds of book clubs found us, loved the site, and offered suggestions on how to improve it. We relaunched in site in 2017 based on user feedback. Now the site is serving and connecting thousands of book clubs all over the world.</p>
      <p>Everyone asked for an app, so we built one! Our iOS and Android apps launched earlier this fall. Nancy, a publishing professional with a passion for storytelling joined the Bookclubz cofounding team in 2018. Anna and Nancy lead six book clubs between the two of them, which are continually a source of inspiration for designing Bookclubz tools and features. </p>
      <p>
        <b>What are your plans for the app's future?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Right now, we're serving over 5,000 clubs. In the next two years we hope to help over 30,000 clubs in the US and around the world get organized! </p>
      <p>We are continually adding new features and enhancements to Bookclubz. In the year ahead, we'll be launching a calendar integration feature, social networking capabilities so you can follow other clubs, and a built-in virtual meeting tool for all of the book clubs on our site that meet via video conference.</p>
