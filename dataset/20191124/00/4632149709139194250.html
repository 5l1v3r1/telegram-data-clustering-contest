      <h1>Maha twist: Fadnavis back as CM, Ajit is his deputy</h1>

      <p>Saturday saw a twist in Maharashtra’s politics that stumped even the battle-hardened politicians. Devendra Fadnavis returned as chief minister, propped up by NCP’s Ajit Pawar, who was made his deputy, just hours after the new alliance of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress reached a consensus that Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray will be their chief ministerial candidate. <br/><br/>The Shiv Sena approached the Supreme Court against the “arbitrary and mala fide actions/decisions” of Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari of swearing in Fadnavis. Fadnavis and Ajit were sworn in by Koshyari at 7.50 am at a hush-hush ceremony after dramatic midnight developments, leading to the lifting of the President’s Rule in Maharashtra. <br/><br/>Ajit’s volte face created fissures in the NCP, whose chief Sharad Pawar distanced himself from his nephew’s action, saying the decision to back the BJP was his personal choice and not that of the party. Later in the day, the NCP removed Ajit as the party’s legislature unit head, saying his move was not in line with the party’s policies. The decision was taken at the meeting of the party’s legislators, where 49 of its 54 MLAs were present, sources said. <br/><br/>There were also reports that Fadnavis and Ajit met the governor separately late Friday night, after which he sent a report to the Centre suggesting that the President’s Rule be lifted. After the dramatic early morning swearing in, leaders of the Sena and the Congress cried foul calling the Governor’s action as a murder of democracy. <br/>While Uddhav Thackeray said it is a ‘surgi-cal strike’ on the people of Maharashtra and they would avenge it, Sena leader Sanjay Raut accused Ajit of stabbing people of Maharashtra in the back by deciding to join hands with the BJP. The Congress termed the swearing-in a “black chapter in India’s history”, and said the BJP acted as a “contract killer” of democracy and the governor once again proved to be BJP chief Amit Shah’s “hitman”.</p>

      <p>Addressing a press conference in Delhi, Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said an “opportunist Ajit Pawar”, accused by the saffron party in the past of corruption, was “scared by the BJP of being put behind bars”. The BJP, however, asserted that it had the electoral and moral mandate to form a government in Maharashtra and brushed aside the criticism of its alliance with Ajit, saying the tie-up was guided by the “given situation”. <br/><br/>Few had an inkling of the swearing-in ceremony -- which some dubbed a clandestine affair -- at Raj Bhavan in south Mumbai. The event was a far cry from Fadnavis’s first such ceremony in 2014 in the packed Wankhede Stadium in presence of thousands of supporters. The swearing-in ceremony was held soon after the President’s Rule, imposed on November 12, was revoked. President Ram Nath Kovind signed the proclamation for revocation of the central rule and a gazette notification to this effect was issued at 5.47 am. <br/><br/>As questions cropped up whether a meeting of the Union Cabinet was held to recommend revocation of the President’s rule, a senior home ministry official said the approval was given by the Central government by invoking a special provision of The Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules which gives the prime minister special powers. <br/><br/>The Rule 12 says: “Departure from Rules: The prime minister may, in any case or classes of cases, permit or condone a departure from these rules, to the extent he deems necessary”. The prime minister gave this approval, which acts as post-facto approval of the Union Cabinet, the official said. <br/>The swearing-in came as a political shocker, hours after Uddhav emerged as the Sena-NCP-Congress’ consensus candidate for the top post. Pawar said his nephew and other MLAs of the party who have switched sides would attract the provisions of the anti-defection law. He added that the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena, along with independents and smaller parties, have the support of 169 to 170 MLAs, and they were ready to form the government. “Around 6.30 am-6.45 am, I got a call that some NCP legislators had been brought to Raj Bhavan. After some time, we came to know that Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar were sworn in as chief minister and deputy chief minister,” he said. <br/><br/>Pawar said of the 10 to 11 NCP MLAs, who were present with Ajit Pawar at Raj Bhavan, three have returned to the party. “Two more are on the way,” he said, adding, “We have identified the legislators from TV grabs and photos.” <br/><br/>Uddhav too hit out at the BJP for accusing the Shiv Sena of disrespecting people’s mandate. “I heard the Union cabinet met early morning. Everyone knows what Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj did when he was betrayed and attacked from behind,” he said. <br/><br/>The day’s dramatic events also led to a missing person complaint being filed for an MLA from the Sharad Pawar-led party. Shahapur NCP MLA Daulat Daroda went ‘missing’ after reaching Raj Bhavan where Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar took oath. Daroda had left his constituency in Thane along with his son Karan on Friday night and has since been unreachable after reaching Raj Bhavan.</p>
