        <b>Things are changing at Tottenham. Belgian centre-back, Toby Alderweireld, is in the last year of his contract and it seemed inevitable that he would leave the club at the end of the season, but now he is ready to listen to renewal offers from Spurs.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps it is the arrival of <b>Mourinho</b>, or perhaps just a meer coincidence, but now, according to 'The Telegraph', <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/t-alderweireld-29671/">Alderweireld</a> is ready to at least listen to contract renewal offers from <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham.</a></p>

      <p>The <b>Belgian centre-back </b>had already given up, but the change of coach seems to have made him change his mind. However, even if the Belgian does his part now,<b> the final word will go to Daniel Levy,</b> who will certainly be a little disappointed with his player's attitude.</p>
