      <p>Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang laced into MSNBC Saturday, accusing the network of systemic unfair treatment and publicly refusing an offer to appear on air until he received an apology.</p>
      <p>“Was asked to appear on @msnbc this weekend – and told them that I’d be happy to after they apologize on-air, discuss and include our campaign consistent with our polling, and allow surrogates from our campaign as they do other candidates’. They think we need them. We don’t,” he said in a post which was retweeted more than 9,000 times in a matter of hours.</p>
      <p>“They’ve omitted me from their graphics 12+ times, called me John Yang on air, and given me a fraction of the speaking time over 2 debates despite my polling higher than other candidates on stage. At some point you have to call it,” he added in a follow up.</p>
      <p>MSNBC declined to comment.</p>

      <p>Yang, an entrepreneur who has never held elective office, is one of several outsider candidates looking to break through the crowded Democratic field.</p>
      <p>Though he has raised millions of dollars, Yang has frequently griped about not being included among top-tier candidates by the liberal network.</p>
