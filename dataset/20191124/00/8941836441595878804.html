      <p>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) - Athletic Bilbao won 2-1 at Osasuna in the Spanish league on Sunday, ending the hosts’ club record streak of 31 home games without a loss.</p>
      <p>Striker Iñaki Williams struck first for Bilbao in the 21st minute. Chimy Avila leveled in the 76th, only for Kenan Kodro to restore the visitors’ advantage three minutes later.</p>
      <p>Bilbao’s first away win of the season lifted it into fifth place - five points behind leader Barcelona and second-place Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>Osasuna hadn’t lost at its El Sadar Stadium in Pamplona since a second-tier defeat to Tenerife on April 1, 2018. From that loss it went unbeaten in 24 second-division games and seven home games this season.</p>
      <p>Also, China forward Wu Lei scored to salvage a 1-1 draw for Espanyol at home with Getafe.</p>
