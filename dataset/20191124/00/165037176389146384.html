        <b>Almost halfway through the 2019/20 season there are several top-level coaches that are looking for a coaching job. Pochettino being the latest in this.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Pochettino</b>'s sacking allowed another coaching legend to return, <b>Jose Mourinho</b>. The Premier League has a series of coaches looking for a job, such as <b>Arsene Wenger.</b></p>
      <p><b>Italy</b> also has several legends waiting for an opportunity. Here we are speaking about <b>Massimiliano Allegri </b>(who has had a full year out after winning almost everything with Juventus),<b> Gennaro Gattuso, Luciano Spalletti </b>and<b> Marco Giampaolo.</b></p>

      <p>In the <b>Bundesliga</b>, the recently sacked <b>Niko Kovac</b> is expectant, in <b>France</b>, there is <b>Blanc</b> and in <b>Spain</b> they have <b>Solari, Setien and Marcelino</b> ready to return to action, although they might not coach in the First Division.</p>
      <p>Who will be the next to shine again under the spotlight of <b>football's elite</b>? There are a number of teams that could take a turn at the helm and have <b>a change of coach</b>,Â so maybe we'll soon be out of doubt.</p>
