      <h1>Josh Norman to be healthy scratch for Redskins vs. Lions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/adam-zielonka/" target="_blank">Adam Zielonka</a></address>
      <p>Cornerback <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/josh-norman/">Josh Norman</a> will be active for the Washington Redskins on Sunday against the Detroit Lions despite multiple reports initially saying the team planned to make him a healthy scratch.</p>
      <p>Norman practiced like usual on Wednesday and Thursday, but was downgraded to questionable Friday with a hamstring injury and was a limited participant in practice that day. But reports Sunday morning from 106.7 The Fan and ESPN called the decision a healthy scratch, before ESPN’s Adam Schefter tweeted that “Washington changed its mind” on the matter.</p>

      <p>Norman, who turns 32 in a few weeks, has one interception, six passes defended and a forced fumble this year, but receivers have beaten him in coverage more frequently than usual. It was rumored that he could be dealt at the trade deadline, but he remained with Washington. He has one year left on his contract.</p>

      <p>Defensive coordinator Greg Manusky was recently asked why Norman was having a rough season.</p>

        <p>“Couldn’t tell you why. You got to ask him,” Manusky said. “I think from our situation, we’re putting him in situations to make some plays, and we’re just not making the plays. Sometimes that’s across the board as well on a lot of other players too.”</p>
