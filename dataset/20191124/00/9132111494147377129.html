      <p>The New Patriotic Party (NPP) Member of Parliament (MP) for Nhyiaeso Constituency in Ashanti, Kennedy Kankam, has criticized former President John Mahama for failing to construct adequate roads in the country.</p>
      <p>According to him, “former President Mahama said the infrastructure projects his government built were unprecedented’ but everywhere you go,people ask for roads.</p>
      <p>“It is important to note that unlike the NDC the Akufo-Addo government is eager to spend and fix all funds under the Sinohydro agreement to construct quality roads that will last long for the people”,</p>
      <p>Kennedy Kankam in an interview with Kwame Tutu on Accra based Kingdom 107.7 FM said,” We will fix all bad roads but it is simply unthinkable that the NDC who did a shoddy job on roads in the country is still making noise.”</p>

      <p>According to him, the government will be pumping all monies agreed under the Sinohydro agreement into constructing better roads for the people.</p>
