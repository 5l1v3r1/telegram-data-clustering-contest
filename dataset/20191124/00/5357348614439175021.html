        <b>THE teacher involved in the verbal outburst at Pembroke Hall High School that rose temperatures on social media and infuriated the education status quo last week, could face criminal charges.</b>
      </p>
      <p>However, that would be a last resort, as the initial mode of action would be to have the matter dealt with by school officials, police personnel have said.</p>
      <p>The viral video saw the teacher hurling abusive language at a male student of the St Andrew North Western institution, before she told him to leave the classroom.</p>
      <p>There was no video evidence of what would have sparked the behaviour, described by some education officials as 'uncharacteristic', although there is talk that there was an earlier incident which could have triggered it.</p>
      <p>Officials of the Jamaica Constabulary Force said that the matter could become a criminal one, but only after it has been dealt with at the level of the school's management, and if there is no resolution then.</p>
      <p>One veteran of the force told the Jamaica Observer on Friday, a day after the incident was reportedly recorded, that the teacher could be charged for issuing threats to the student, if the child's parents decided to push the matter to that level.</p>
      <p>The senior officer, who asked not to be identified, said he sympathised with the teacher, but blamed her for reacting in the manner in which she did.</p>
      <p>“Those children out there are very rude. They will drive you almost to hell. But you are a teacher, you should be a role model, and you must be able to exercise restraint,” the senior cop said.</p>
      <p>“Many of the children in our society need to be spoken to. They have no manners. However, what we saw on that video cannot be the way to address forms of indiscipline,” the senior cop stated.</p>
      <p>Senior Superintendent of Police Steve McGregor told the Sunday Observer too, that laying criminal charges against the teacher would be like a last resort, as she was operating from within a “controlled environment” and the regulations that govern her gives her supervisory powers over the children.</p>
      <p>“They are under her guidance and supervision. If when the teacher faces the principal, or the school board and she shows no remorse, then that is where the police can come in,” McGregor said, while adding that she did not exact any physical injuries, which would make her case not as severe.</p>
      <p>“The matter must first be addressed within the context of the school's regulations,” insisted McGregor, the operations officer for Police Area Four in the Corporate Area. But what if the child's parents wanted to press charges against the teacher suggesting that she would kill the boy?</p>
      <p>“If the child's parents have any issue, they must also come through the school first — have dialogue with the principal or the school board, and if at that stage they are still not satisfied with the final decision, they can go to the police. But they must protest to the school first,” McGregor stated.</p>
      <p>The incident has even forced minister without portfolio in the Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation, Karl Samuda, who is overseeing policy direction at the Ministry of Education, Youth and Information, to suggest that it was unlikely that the teacher could continue to work at the school, located at Ken Hill Drive — named after the noted journalist and trade unionist, one of the early members of the now Opposition People's National Party (PNP), who in later years joined the Jamaica Labour Party before returning to the PNP, and also served as mayor of Kingston.</p>
      <p>Samuda has condemned the teacher's action and revealed that an investigation would be held into the matter. The school's principal had stated in media interviews that the teacher would remain on the job, pending a probe being conducted by the school.</p>
      <p>Jamaica Teachers Association President Owen Speid said in radio interviews Friday that he preferred the matter to follow the course of action as outlined in the education code of conduct that governs public institutions of learning.</p>
      <p>Speid would not be drawn into stating a position of whether or not he thought that the teacher ought to be dismissed. Calls have been made on radio talk shows for the teacher to be removed from the school, either by direct dismissal, or by transferring her to another institution.</p>
      <p>But there is some amount of support for the teacher's action, what with incidents of students abusing teachers, verbally and physically, at schools across Jamaica.</p>
      <p>“Dem ya pickney ya dat we have ina Jamaica now a pure crosses,” one woman told the Sunday Observer.</p>
      <p>“A no like one time when pickney haffi behave themselves. Nowadays, the pickney dem too unruly, so a muss provoke dem provoke dat poor woman fi behave so,” the mother of four said.</p>
      <p>Another uttered near sentiments: “The teacher was not correct to do what she did, but it was clear that she was provoked. Something must have provoked her to react that way. That is not normal behaviour. I don't believe that any teacher in Jamaica's education system would behave like that unless something pushed them to,” the retired educator said.</p>
      <p>There is also the issue of the student who videotaped the incident, as no one is allowed the use of phones during classes.</p>
      <p>“What was that child doing using his or her phone in the class?” the retired educator asked.</p>
      <p>“I haven't retired a long time ago, but in my time, no one could bring a phone in my class, unless it was properly concealed.</p>
      <p>“The use of phones to capture everything these days is quite worrying to me and it is something that we as a nation must look into. There are certain things that do not belong in the public domain,” the retired teacher said.</p>
