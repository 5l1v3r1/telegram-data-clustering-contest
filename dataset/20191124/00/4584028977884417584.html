      <h1>If we lose, he played s*** – Guardiola happy to stick with Fernandinho in defence</h1>

      <p>Pep Guardiola is eager for Fernandinho to remain in Manchester City's defence, even if the decision draws criticism.</p>
      <p>Fernandinho has been used primarily as an emergency centre-back this season, with Aymeric Laporte out injured while John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi have struggled with fitness and consistency issues.</p>
      <p>The Brazil international has often looked City's most solid option at the back in Laporte's absence, despite the fact he is primarily a midfielder.</p>
      <p>And Guardiola has no plans to alter Fernandinho's role if his other midfield options stay fit.</p>
      <p>"If Rodri and Gundogan are fit, I don't think so. I like Fernandinho there, in that position [centre-back]. I like it," Guardiola told reporters when asked if he would move the 34-year-old back into the centre of the park.</p>
      <p>"I know he can play there, but we have Gundogan, I trust him a lot, and Rodri.</p>
      <p>"Since I arrived here we were looking for a holding midfielder in the first season. Fernandinho was good [against Chelsea] because we won.</p>
      <p>"If we lose, he played s***, I know that, but we won. So at Anfield he was the best central defender we have there, but [apparently] it was a disaster. I know how it works, this job.</p>
      <p>"He was incredible at Anfield, he was incredible [against Chelsea]. He is so fast, in our build-up he's perfect.</p>
      <p>"It is important to be aggressive as the midfielder but to be quick with the ball and to find solutions in smaller spaces. Gundogan has that quality. That's why we look [at him] in other situations."</p>
      <p>While City's injury problems have come mainly in defence so far this season, Guardiola harbours concerns over Sergio Aguero, who was forced off late on in the 2-1 win over Chelsea on Saturday.</p>
      <p>However, Guardiola has no doubts Gabriel Jesus – who has scored five goals in all competitions this season – can fill the void should Aguero miss an extended period of time.</p>
      <p>"Gabriel has made one of the best starts this season. If Sergio cannot play in the next games, we will see, Gabriel will be of course our option," Guardiola said.</p>
      <p>"[Raheem] Sterling can play also in that position but Gabriel is going to play there of course."</p>
