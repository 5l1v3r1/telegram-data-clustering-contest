      <h2>2019's I'm A Celeb bunch have some truly weird choices for their luxury items</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:10:46+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 00:10</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Tonight's I'm A Celebrity saw the famous faces finally earn their luxury items.</p>
      <p>Each celeb is allowed one item each, with only Adele Roberts and Kate Garraway managing to win theirs in an earlier challenge.</p>
      <p>While Adele bizarrely opted for a picture of her idol, Loose Women's Jane McDoanld, for luck, tonight's revelations show she might not be the only oddball in camp.</p>
      <p>EastEnders legend Cliff Parisi opted for a dash of Christmas cheer with a quite strange - but no less sweet - choice of a camp Christmas tree.</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal footballer Ian Wright meanwhile had his new pals holding their breaths after he announced his item wasn't "physical."</p>
      <p>Music lilted through the jungle as he announced his item as a track of Kirk Franklin's Looking For You.</p>

      <p>The newly reunited camp had a jig round the fire as they heard music for the first time in ten days.</p>
      <p>Reality star Caitlyn Jenner went for face cream, explaining she doesn't like sleeping with a dry face.</p>
      <p>Roman Kemp had a mug with a snap of his girlfriend on it, Nadine Coyle had a de-tangler for her hair, and Andy Whyment went for the simple pleasures with some lip balm.</p>

      <p>Myles Stephenson got his disposable camera, Andrew Maxell his inflatable chair and newly elected camp leader James Haskell his neck support pillow.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline Jossa had a pillow with photos of her family printed all over.</p>
      <p>"All hail the leader," camp shouted as James walked into camp.</p>

      <p>"James is perfect to be a leader," Ian reckoned, "When you look at the chores, they suit everybody. I know a leader when I see one."</p>
      <p>After James picked Jacqueline to be his Deputy, Caitlyn joked: "Our romance is over. You picked someone else."</p>
      <p>It was an emotional episode for a few campmates - Jacqueline and Andrew both had a cry.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline couldn't keep back the tears as Ant &amp; Dec told her she and Ian Wright would be taking on the latest Bushtucker Trial, The Crevice of Cruelty.</p>
      <p>Andrew had some tears too as he confided to Jacqueline and James that she was considering packing it in and leaving.</p>
      <p>"You'd never leave," Jacqueline insisted, "I can tell you that. You're just tired."</p>
