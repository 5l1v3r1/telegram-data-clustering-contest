      <h1>The Climate Election? Johnson And Corbyn Grapple With Green Fervour</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Alasdair Lane</a></address>
      <p>It ought to be a wholly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/06/theresa-may-calls-for-red-white-and-blue-brexit">red, white, and blue</a> election, given the focus on Brexit; but Britain’s ballot battle is starting to look rather green. A year of unprecedented protests and activism has forced climate change into voters’ minds like never before. Over half the electorate now say global warming could be a deciding factor come polling day, giving those on the campaign trail plenty to ponder.Environmentalism’s ascendancy in the political arena is striking. Ahead of the 2017 election, scarcely one-in-ten listed ecological issues among the top three problems facing Britain, according to YouGov. Today, that figure’s over a quarter. Other polls paint an evener greener picture. 54% of those surveyed by ClientEarth, an environmental law firm, said climate change was critical enough to sway their vote. Among under-25s, that number leapt to three-quarters.  </p>

      <p>Much of the groundswell can be pinned to Extinction Rebellion’s explosive emergence. The movement has used mass assembly to devastating effect, forcing the public eye onto green policy though a mix of peaceful protest and extreme civil disobedience. Now, desperate to stay relevant, the UK’s political heavyweights hope to harness the eco-fervor. </p>
      <p>Sensing a slip in support to the Greens and Liberal Democrats, Labour is particularly keen to make its mark environmentally. His government would “lead the world in tackling the climate emergency,” leader Jeremy Corbyn proclaimed this week. If elected, he would establish a £250bn ‘Green Transformation Fund’ to pay for eco-minded apprenticeships and electric vehicle loans, and would overhaul the UK’s energy sector in line with Labour’s ‘green new deal’.</p>
      <p>But on the issue of emissions, Corbyn fell short of his party’s wishes. In September, Labour’s annual conference called for the country to be carbon neutral by 2030, a pledge their leader - under pressure from jobs-minded trade unions - has failed to fulfil, committing only to meet the “substantial majority” of reduction targets by next decade’s end. </p>

        <figcaption>LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - APRIL 23: Environmental activists from Extinction Rebellion march to ... [+] Parliament Square on the ninth day of protest action, aiming to invite MPs to take part in people's assembly on climate and ecological crisis as they return to the Commons after Easter break, on 23 April, 2019 in London, England. The protest is part of global 'International Rebellion', a non violent, civil disobedience movement calling for decisive action from governments in the face of climate change and ecological collapse to avoid the possibility of human extinction in the near future.

      <p>Facing their own eco-woes, the Conservatives are unlikely to make much of the step-down. The party’s foremost green boast - enshrining in law a net-zero carbon target by 2050 - is credible, but experts worry their policies don’t match the heady ambition. Lacking a plan to meaningfully clean the UK’s sooty central heating system and failing to effectively incentivise eco-friendly vehicles, the government is falling fatally behind on its global warming goals, the independent Committee on Climate Change warns. </p>
      <p>A self-styled environmentalist, Boris Johnson has worked to bolster the Tories’ green credentials. In lieu of EU oversight post-Brexit, a new watchdog - the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) - will police Whitehall’s eco-strategy, he announced last month. Departments that falter on environmental standards will be held in contempt of court, Johnson warned - but unlike its Brussels predecessor, the OEP will lack any means to issue financial penalties. Campaigners have also questioned the body’s independence, noting that both its board and budget will be decided by the government. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Equally contentious is the Conservatives’ headline u-turn on fracking. In 2013, Tory chancellor George Osborne promised “the most generous tax breaks in the world” to support the UK’s fledgling shale gas industry, but within days of the election being called the plans were shelved. While initially welcomed by the green lobby, pressure to replace the moratorium with an outright ban is mounting. Some have also questioned the move’s apparent political expediency: several of the Tories’ top target seats in the Midlands and Northwest England face fracking’s worst ecological fallout. </p>

      <p>But Johnson is unlikely to be concerned by his eco-critics. His pledges are by design more modest than Corbyn’s. Environmentalism has surged in the public consciousness - but Brexit still takes the biscuit. Hitting his Leave attack lines over and over again is the key to victory, Tory tacticians believe; drawing attention to other areas is self-defeating. Little wonder <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/channel-4-news-will-empty-chair-boris-johnson-if-he-refuses-leaders-climate-debate/">the prime minister seems set to snub an environment-themed</a> televised leaders’ debate.  </p>
      <p>But climate change permeates every political issue: healthcare, economics, education, and yes, even Brexit. It has been dismissed as an electoral side-show before, but that strategy is growing ever more tenuous. This isn’t quite an eco-election - but it’s a greener race than ever before.</p>
