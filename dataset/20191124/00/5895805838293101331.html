        <i>In this blog, author Wesley Davidson relays her trajectory of losing a child to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/addiction">drug abuse</a>. Unfortunately, Ms. Davidson’s story is played out all across the United States. In 2017, the year after Ms. Davidson’s son overdosed, over 70,000 U.S. citizens died similar deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control. As Wesley fully knows, losing a child to drugs is every parent’s nightmare. It leaves the mourner with many issues.</i>

      <p>Wesley’s Experience</p>
      <p>Last week Wesley spoke about her <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger">anger</a>, feeling powerless to break the grip addiction had on her son.</p>
      <p>Dr. Joe responds:</p>
      <p>Anger is an emotion designed to change something. We get angry when we want someone to stop doing something or start doing something. In Wesley’s case, as with so many parents of children challenged by addiction, they want them to stop doing drugs and start being sober.</p>
      <p>Anger is the fight branch of our primitive fight-flight response. It is activated when we are faced with a predator and quickly decide if we can beat it, in which case we will approach it with the intention to get it to run away. If only managing addiction was this easy. Wesley was angry and wanted her son to change. But as his addiction progressed, her anger, her <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/erectile-disorder">impotent</a> rage, began to change. Behind anger there was disappointment, in herself, her husband, her child. And as that progressed, and she recognized her anger would not change the addiction, she began to feel more and more powerless. Powerless as she could not do anything in the wake of such a dangerous and determined predator. And more in danger of being consumed herself by this predator Addiction.</p>
      <p>I believe the most difficult emotion for a human to tolerate is being powerless. Millions of years ago being powerless meant we were about to be lunch, eaten and destroyed by a predator. Our modern brains try to avoid this ancient limbic feeling by pretending we had power. We make things up, the should haves, could have, the if-only. If only I had been a better parent. If only my husband had not given him money. If only I had sent him to the right treatment center. If only those doctors had made it better and make the addiction go away.</p>
      <p>But as Wesley’s story emerges, perhaps addiction was not the real challenge here. Perhaps it was her son’s overwhelming sense of inadequacy, stemming way, way back to being adopted: not being good enough for his biological parents, being gay, being less valuable. Perhaps the only way he could feel any pleasure was to use drugs. Perhaps the real challenge was not the addiction but <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression">depression</a>.</p>
      <p>Depression is also part of the fight-flight response. The fight is anger in humans. The flight is <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxiety</a> in humans when you know you are facing a danger, a predator you cannot beat so you want to get the hell out of there. But sometimes you are faced with a predator you know you are not strong enough to fight, but you just cannot escape. In this case, the best strategy is to freeze, to become invisible and to hope the danger passes. I believe in humans this is depression: you are not strong enough to get the danger to change but you also cannot get away. Depression can be overwhelming and lead more and more to being hopeless, helpless and worthless.</p>
      <p>Wesley describes her son as progressively feeling more and more worthless, with less and less value. We know that one of the greatest risk factors for first-time substance use in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/adolescence">teenagers</a> is low <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-esteem">self-esteem</a>. That is what Wesley describes in her son.</p>
      <p>It is reasonable to blame all of those programs and care providers who did not help. It is another part of anger I see in so many parents of children who are challenged by addiction. It is a wish that someone, somewhere, could get their child to change. But it is also a source of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/embarrassment">shame</a> and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/guilt">guilt</a>, the topics of our last two blogs. Guilt that the parent did something wrong. Shame that the world knows the parent was inadequate. It is a sinister part of the stigma parents experience that keeps them all too often from seeking help for their child.</p>
      <p>But addiction is not about <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/ethics-and-morality">morality</a>, it is about mortality. Simply the way the brain works. The anger, powerlessness, and guilt Wesley feels are all too common. She felt disrespected by her son, as if he had chosen drugs over her, over her love, her desire to be a parent, her wish to help him change.</p>
      <p>But when is the last time you got angry at someone treating you with respect? That is part of the path we can all take when working with people challenged by addiction. Don’t take it personally as the choice of drugs over trust is part of the addiction. Step back. Look again at why your child is doing what they are doing. Look again. Again look. Again like repeating something, look like a spectator. Let’s respect why they are using and change that anger to trying to rekindle respect in themselves.</p>
      <p>The people I know who are challenged by drugs and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/alcohol">alcohol</a> are often angry… at themselves. This can increase their already low self-esteem. And to feel pleasure, some pleasure, they use again, exacerbating the deadly cycle of substance use. But rather than blame themselves, and rather than be angry with them for using, we have the capacity to remind them that they really are valuable. That they matter. Perhaps the real "cure" to addiction is not anger but compassion: A constant reminder that the person challenged by addiction remains <i>valuable.</i></p>
      <p>People challenged by addiction need the support of all around them, the love of all around them, the respect of all around them that addiction is not about morality but about mortality. It is the way the brain works. And rather than be angry, or afraid, or depressed, let’s use that fourth F that humans have evolved: Family. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/friends">Friendship</a>. Fellowship. (And if you are not very good at spelling Physician.) Remind them all the time of their value. All the time.</p>
