      <p>The spectacular Christmas tree in the Regent Theatre foyer has special significance this year.</p>
      <p>The theatre recently bought 100 Farmers Collectable Hospice Baubles, as part of an annual fundraising campaign in support of hospices around New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Farmers in Dunedin and Oamaru have set up a remembrance tree and everyone who makes a donation to hospice in-store receives a remembrance card to write a special message for someone they will be thinking about this Christmas.</p>
      <p>Collectable hospice baubles are also available for sale as part of the campaign, with 100% of bauble sales in Dunedin and Oamaru donated to the Otago Community Hospice.</p>
      <p>Regent Theatre general manager Sarah Anderson said the theatre was ‘‘happy to support such an important organisation — one charity to another’’.</p>
      <p>‘‘The decorations are a beautiful addition to our tree, something we enjoy sharing with our audiences,’’ she said.</p>
      <p>This year’s collectable bauble was designed by Maori artist Spencer Bellas, and depicts the ngaru, or wave, representing the journey of life.</p>
      <p>Otago Community Hospice chief executive Ginny Green was delighted to have the support of Farmers this Christmas and in past years.</p>
      <p>‘‘Over the past five years the Christmas fundraising with Farmers has raised $3.4 million for hospices throughout the country, and in Dunedin and Oamaru the campaign has contributed close to $40,000 to the fundraising target for the last two years,’’ Ms Green said.</p>
      <p>‘‘The staff in Dunedin and Oamaru are amazingly supportive of this campaign, and really go over and above to fundraise for us.</p>
      <p>‘‘It's an incredible effort at the end of a long year, and all of us here at hospice take our hats off to the Farmers teams — they do an incredible job,’’ she said.</p>
      <p>The hand-painted collectable baubles are available online, and in the Farmers stores nationwide, until Christmas Eve.</p>
