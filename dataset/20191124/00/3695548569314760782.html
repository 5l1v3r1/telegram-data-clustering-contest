        <b>Single-seater regulars Carlin missed out on a first sportscar win since 2001 in the Asian Le Mans Series in Shanghai, after a post-race penalty dropped it to third.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Carlin's expansion into prototype racing in LMP2 this year was its first in sportscars since a single season in the Porsche Supercup in 2001, winning once with Sacha Maassen.</p>
      <p>But it endured a trying European Le Mans Series campaign (pictured above), with a best finish of ninth at Barcelona, and has entered the four-round Asian series with the aim of winning the guaranteed slot on the grid at next year's Le Mans 24 Hours that comes with the championship.</p>
      <p>A last-lap pass from Harry Tincknell - sharing Carlin's Dallara P217 with Ben Barnicoat and Jack Manchester - on Roman Rusinov's Algarve Pro-run G-Drive Oreca (pictured below) looked to have secured victory in the first round of the four-race Asian series.</p>
      <p>But when Barnicoat was found to have exceeded his maximum driving time by six minutes and 36 seconds, Carlin was handed a penalty of three laps plus 51 seconds, promoting the Rusinov, James French and Leonard Hoogenboom car.</p>
      <p>After ex-Formula 1 driver Roberto Merhi beat Tincknell to pole by 0.051s in Eurasia Motorsport's Ligier JSP217, the Spaniard's team-mate Aidan Read led French and Manchester in the opening stint, before losing the lead in the first pitstop phase to French.</p>
      <p>But progressively worsening tyre-wear at the conclusion of French's double stint allowed Barnicoat - in for Manchester - to move into the lead for the first time, only for a safety car and full course yellow just after half-distance to eradicate Manchester's advantage and condense the top three.</p>

      <p>Nick Foster, sharing the Eurasia Ligier with Merhi and Read, quickly passed Hoogenboom and Manchester when racing resumed, only for Hoogenboom to move back ahead shortly afterwards.</p>
      <p>The G-Drive car continued to lead in Rusinov's hands heading into the final hour until Barnicoat capitalised on an error from Rusinov at the Turn 14 hairpin.</p>
      <p>But the advantage swung back towards G-Drive when Tincknell entered the fray with 28 minutes to go, Rusinov staying aboard when he pitted two laps later and resuming in front.</p>
      <p>Tincknell hunted Rusinov down and made what appeared to be the winning move on the final tour at the Turn 13 right-hander leading onto the long back straight.</p>
      <p>But what would have been only the second win for the Dallara in an ACO-sanctioned series - after SMP Racing's ELMS victory at Paul Ricard in August 2017 - proved short-lived when the stewards intervened.</p>
      <p>Merhi, Foster and Read finished second, ensuring three different marques filled the top three positions.</p>
      <p>LMP3 honours were claimed by reigning champion Inter Europol Competition, Martin Hippe and Nigel Moore beating the lead LMP2-Am car of former F2 racer Arjun Maini, John Farano and Andrew Higgins to fifth overall.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Aston Martin came out on top in the GT bout, with the D'station Racing Vantage GT3 shared by Ross Gunn, Satoshi Hoshino and Tomonobu Fuji finishing 10th overall.</p>
