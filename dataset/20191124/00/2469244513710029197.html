      <h2>WARNING: The Cornish do not come out well in this story</h2>

      <p>The argument is over - ancient folklore traces the history of clotted cream right back to Devon.</p>
      <p>The rivalry between Devon and Cornwall over the origins of 'clouted' cream' has increased in recent years with both sides claiming that they know the 'right' way to prepare a cream tea,</p>
      <p>The Cornish insist that scones should have jam spread first with cream on top.</p>
      <p>But here in Devon a gurt big dollop of cream is spread on to the scone, with jam on top.</p>
      <p>And now Devon Live has unearthed this tale as old as time which pinpoints the invention of clotted cream to Dinger Tor, close to where the Army training camp is now near Okehampton.</p>
      <p>It is retold on the <a href="https://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/learning/dartmoor-legends/the-story-of-clotted-cream">Dartmoor National Park</a> . In fact the story starts from medieval British history in the 9th century which tells how the first king of England, Brutus of Troy, sets sail for the island then known as Albion and lands at Totnes.</p>

      <p>Here Brutus and his men take on the 'giants' of Albion and when they win Brutus becomes king and names the country Britain after himself.</p>
      <p>When the giants had been driven out by Brutus, many made their homes on Dartmoor while the rest fled even further, into Cornwall. </p>
      <p>One of those who settled on Dartmoor was Giant Blunderbus, who settled on Dinger Tor.</p>
      <p>Blunderbus had four wives and his favourite was Jennie - the youngest and prettiest. This made the older four bitter and jealous and they made life hell for Blunderbus until he eventually agreed to send her away.</p>
      <p>But he could not let her go completely so he installed her in a cave on the Cornish cliffs where he could visit her secretly.</p>
      <p>One day, Jennie saw a gang of evil Cornish wreckers (the Cornish do not come out well in this story) using lights to lead a ship on to the rocks. Jennie saw the lights of the ship turning and heading towards the treacherous cliffs below her cave.  Frantically she heaped up firewood and set it alight.  The ship realising the danger dropped anchor and sent a boat inshore to investigate.</p>
      <p>The Phoenician Captain thanked Jennie and asked her what he could do for her in return. She told her story and the captain realised that Jennie would only be happy if she were reunited with her beloved Blunderbus.</p>
      <p>And he repaid her with 'a recipe for the most wonderful food you have ever tasted'.</p>

      <p>The recipe was for clotted or clouted cream as it was then called.</p>
      <p>"On Blunderbus’s next visit Jennie gave him a cream tea and Blunderbus was amazed and delighted with his clever young wife, and immediately took her back with him to Dinger Tor.</p>
      <p>"The other wives were annoyed at first, but on tasting this delicious new food welcomed Jennie back and entreated her to show them how to make it.  Jennie showed them, and eventually the fame of this clouted cream spread through Devon.  People came from all over Devon to learn about the new food and how to make it.  The three wives were happy to be so important and sought after, and spent their days teaching the many visitors how to make clouted cream.</p>
      <p>"Devon is still famous for clotted cream, so the next time you enjoy one of our famous cream tea’s, remember you owe it all to Jennie the lovely young wife of Blunderbus of Dinger Tor."</p>
