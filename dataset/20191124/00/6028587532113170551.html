      <p>The NFL levied its final judgement against those involved in the now-infamous Week 11 brawl between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers. The indefinite suspension Myles Garrett was handed for ripping off Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph’s helmet and hitting him in the head with it <a href="https://sportsnaut.com/2019/11/nfl-upholds-myles-garretts-indefinite-suspension/">was upheld on appeal</a>. Garrett himself has also been fined north of $45,000.</p>
      <p>Despite not being suspended, Rudolph received the largest fine at $50,000. These two were among the whopping 33 players disciplined in the fight.</p>
      <p>Of those suspended, Steelers guard Maurkice Pouncey saw his ban reduced from three games to two. Meanwhile, Browns defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi’s one-game suspension was upheld.</p>
      <p>That’s the end of it, right?</p>
      <p>Not so fast. The dramatic backstory stemming from Garrett’s appeal now includes the Pro Bowl pass rusher claiming that Mason Rudolph <a href="https://sportsnaut.com/2019/11/browns-myles-garrett-claims-mason-rudolph-used-racial-slur/">directed racial slurs</a> at him prior to the fight.</p>
      <p>These claims have to be taken seriously. While they wouldn’t excuse Garrett’s actions, they’d sure as heck explain why he got so heated.</p>
      <p>The NFL looked into said allegations and found <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1197623527878406144?s=20">there was no evidence to back up Garrett’s claims</a>. Like clockwork, Rudolph’s camp responded in kind.</p>
      <p>“According to ESPN, in his appeal, Myles Garrett falsely asserted that Mason Rudolph uttered a racial slur toward him, prior to swinging a helmet at Mason’s uncovered head, in a desperate attempt to mitigate his suspension,” <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1197582583531540480">attorney Timothy M. Younger said in a statement</a>. “This is a lie. This false allegation was never asserted by Garrett in the aftermath of the game, never suggested prior to the hearing and was conspicuously absent in the apology published by the Browns and adopted by Garrett.”</p>

      <p>Since the allegations arose this past Thursday, players on both teams have indicated they did not hear Rudolph <a href="https://sportsnaut.com/2019/11/steelers-browns-players-speak-out-on-mason-rudolph-allegations/">direct a racial slur at Garrett</a>. Meanwhile, the NFL indicates that there’s no audio available of the skirmish.</p>
      <p>Garrett himself did not come out with the allegations in the immediate aftermath of the incident, leading to speculation that he attempted to create falsehoods in an attempt to reduce the NFL-mandated indefinite suspension.</p>
      <p>We’re really not in a position to judge one way or another here. Only Garrett and Rudolph know the truth. It’s also a pretty major backstory as the league attempts to move on from this drama.</p>
      <p>If Garrett is lying, he’s going to have a reputation of making false claims at a time in American society that these allegations have to be taking seriously. We’re certainly seeing a racial divide in this nation. Racism has been ramped up during the current political climate. The NFL has been at the center of it since the Colin Kaepernick-led national anthem protests of 2016.</p>
      <p>This type dog whistle could harm Garrett’s reputation moving forward if somehow it’s proven to be false.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if somehow the allegations are proven true, it will do irreparable harm to Rudolph’s reputation on his team, around the league and within the broader construct of American society. There’s no room in a sport for racism. The dark cloud hovering over Rudolph would be akin to his career pretty much being over.</p>
      <p>It’s in this that there’s no real winners here. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2019/11/15/nfl-must-set-a-precedent-with-myles-garrett-suspension-after-ugly-incident/">As ugly as the incident in Cleveland back on Nov. 14 was</a>, the fall out from it has been even uglier.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2019/11/15/nfl-gets-it-right-with-suspension-of-myles-garrett-two-others/">The NFL did right</a> in handing down these harsh punishments. It also did right in looking into Garrett’s allegations. At this point, there’s just no evidence to back up what Garrett said. That leaves pretty much everything on the front burner until something else comes out. If that happens at all.</p>
      <p>We’re engaged in a current American society that has seen racial divide threaten to tear this country apart. Allegations of this nature add another layer to the entire situation. It’s not simply about football. It’s not about the game we watch on a weekly basis or the personalities of the players on the field.</p>
      <p>It’s about a lot more than that. It’s strangely a representation of the broader American conversation and argument right now. Racism should have no place in this society heading into 2020. It’s the end of a decade that began with racial tensions seemingly at a boiler plate level with the first African American president holding office.</p>
      <p>The decade now ends with no more answers to these century long questions about the role of race in American society. If nothing else, Garrett’s allegations play right into this narrative. This makes the entire situation a lose-lose for all involved regardless of who is telling the truth.</p>
