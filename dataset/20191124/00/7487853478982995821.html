      <h1>Twitter Reacts to Phil Jones' Latest Nightmare, Calamity Man Utd, Good Man Utd &amp; More</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15362714" target="_blank">Gary Stringer</a></address>
      <p>​Manchester United <i>almost</i> completed a completely undeserved comeback at Bramall Lane on Sunday evening, scoring three goals in ten second-half minutes after falling 2-0 behind to Sheffield United. </p>
      <p>But they didn't as the Blades grabbed a deserved equaliser thanks to Oli McBurnie, confirmed after VAR determined that he'd controlled the ball with his shoulder in the build up, rather than with his arm.</p>

      <p>Before the game, Phil Jones' inclusion in the starting XI had <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">​Manchester United</a> fans breaking into a nervous sweat, particularly as it wasn't immediately clear whether he'd be featuring in defence or midfield.</p>
      <p>Naturally, after just 18 minutes, Jones proved why fans were right to be apprehensive - as abysmal positioning on two separate occasions forced David de Gea into action to deny John Lundstram from long-range, followed by David McGoldrick's close range header.</p>
      <p>While United got away with those two mistakes, they didn't escape a third time. A simple long ball over the top proved far too much for Jones to handle as Lys Mousset shrugged him off with ease, before he teed up Lundstram - whose shot was palmed by De Gea into the path of the onrushing John Fleck to give the Blades the lead.</p>
      <p>It went down well on Twitter, as you can imagine.</p>

      <p>The goal was only fuel to the confident Blades' fire and they dominated their more illustrious opposition for the remainder of the first half. The only disappointment will have been that they didn't add to their tally. </p>
      <p>To say that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had his work cut out at half-time would have been a monumental understatement - everything needed to change for his side to get back into the game...</p>

      <p>Despite replacing <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/phil-jones">​Jones</a> with Jesse Lingard at half time, the Red Devils continued to saunter around the pitch at a painfully slow speed and <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/sheff-utd">​Sheffield United</a> extended their domination. </p>
      <p>Mousset robbed the ball in his own half and slotted beyond De Gea after a smart exchange with Fleck - the Blades were 2-0 ahead and cruising. </p>

      <p>Then, by some complete and utter miracle, Solskjaer's side realised they were in a football match - one they were losing and had under-performed in for 70 minutes. </p>
      <p>What followed was a remarkable turnaround (at least United fans thought it was) and the Red Devils snatched three goals in seven minutes. Brandon Williams and Mason Greenwood grabbed their first Premier League goals for the club, before Marcus Rashford's strike gave them a 3-2 lead.</p>
      <p>However, their joy was to be short-lived - much to Twitter's amusement... </p>

      <p>​​As the Blades pushed for a late equaliser, United introduced Axel Tuanzebe and dropped deep to protect their lead. On a day when Solskjaer got so little right, this turned out the be undoing of their late revival and invited pressure from the home side. </p>
      <p>With the game ticking into stoppage time, the ball pinged around United's box and arrived in front of McBurnie - the Scotland striker controlled it with his chest, struck home and Bramall Lane erupted. Or was it his arm? It was time for another VAR check, this one probably not long enough to stick the kettle on but not far off it. The goal stood - comeback over!</p>
      <p>The irony? McBurnie had called for VAR to be scrapped via his Twitter account less than 24 hours before. However, on this occasion it seemed to make the right call and salvaged a point for his side.</p>
