      <h1>Zinedine Zidane Issues Fresh Plea for Fans to Stop Booing Gareth Bale After La Real Win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15203443" target="_blank">Adam Aladay</a></address>
      <p>​Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane has urged fans to stop booing Gareth Bale following his antics while away on international duty. </p>
      <p>The forward recently helped Wales secure their place at Euro 2020 and after the match, he held up a Welsh flag that read: 'Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order'. Despite this, he was brought on midway through the second half of Los Blancos' tussle with Real Sociedad on Saturday evening. However, he was greeted with a chorus of boos.</p>

      <p>As the 30-year-old entered the field, a large majority of the Santiago Bernabeu jeered him and  continued to do so with every touch he took. However, Zidane has backed Bale and insisted he hopes he doesn't continue to receive a similar kind of reception, but the manager refused to comment on whether he believed the fans' reaction was justified. </p>
      <p>"I hope [the whistling] doesn't carry on for the rest of the season," Zidane said after the game, as <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2019/11/24/5dd9c0cae2704e1dae8b4577.html">​quoted by Marca</a>. "We want the fans to be with us from start to finish, but we can't control this. The fans have the right to do what they want, but I'm asking them to applaud everyone.</p>

      <p>"I'm happy with the game and the victory and <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/gareth-bale">​Bale</a> came into the game well. I can't say whether [the whistling to Bale] is unfair or not. Everyone can think what they want."</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old went on to reveal that he has not spoken with the former <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/tottenham">​Tottenham</a> man regarding the flag, but insisted that the Welshman wants to be a part of the squad.</p>
      <p>"I haven't spoken to [Bale about the Wales celebrations], I've only given him my congratulations [for qualifying for Euro 2020]," he continued.</p>

      <p>"What you have to do is keep working on the pitch. There's too much noise with Bale, he wants to be with us and do well. Therefore, we don't want to speak too much. He is integrated into the group and he wants to play with the others."</p>
