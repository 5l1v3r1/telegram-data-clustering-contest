      <p>Captain Steven Taylor pulled off heroic touches at both ends of the park as Wellington Phoenix bagged their first win of the A-League season, 2-1 over Brisbane Roar.</p>
      <p>Coming off their worst start to any campaign with a solitary draw through five games, relief was delivered to new coach Ufuk Talay in Wellington on Saturday through goals in each half to classy offshore signings Taylor and Ulises Davila.</p>
      <p>Their sharp finishes decided an even contest, with Brisbane slipping back to the inaccurate ways in front of goal that hampered them before last week's thrilling 4-3 upset of Melbourne City.</p>
      <p>Talay was pleased his team finally got what they'd deserved through the opening rounds, believing luck hadn't been on their shoulder.</p>
      <p>"I'm not relieved. Moreso I think it's been coming," he said.</p>
      <p>"We've played some really good football and haven't been rewarded for the way we've played.</p>
      <p>"Today, like I said, was like a final, to not get detached from the other teams (on the standings)."</p>
      <p>Wellington fielded the same XI that drew with Melbourne Victory two weeks ago while the visitors' lone change was the introduction of left winger Jordan Courtney-Perkins, making him the youngest starting player in Roar history.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old Brisbane academy product enjoyed a solid outing but was guilty of squandering his team's best chance during a crucial early period.</p>
      <p>Taylor had put Wellington in front with a header from Davila's cross in the 10th minute, rising above a flat-footed Roar defence.</p>
      <p>Minutes later the former Newcastle United centre back denied Courtney-Perkins with an instinctive goal-line clearance after the teenager smashed a close range volley.</p>
      <p>Brisbane looked the sharper outfit in the first half but fell away in the second spell after coach Robbie Fowler surprisingly removed impressive Welsh forward Aaron Amadi-Holloway at the break.</p>
      <p>Fowler said it was simply a substandard display from his team across the park, lamenting they only came alive late when trailing by two goals.</p>
      <p>"We questioned a few of them at halftime, we wanted a reaction. But the changes that we made, we never probably got the reaction from them," Fowler said.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes it happens in football where the players are not performing to the best of their abilities for whatever reason.</p>
      <p>"And we're missing quite a lot of chances this year. If you're missing chances, you struggle to win games."</p>
      <p>Lively Mexican Davila rifled home a left-footed drive from the top of the box for his fourth goal of the season and he looked like adding more as Wellington finished the stronger.</p>
      <p>However, Stefan Mauk set Phoenix pulses racing with an 85th-minute goal, steering home Brad Inman's assist.</p>
      <p>It was the third loss for Fowler's men while Wellington's three points lifts them off the bottom of the ladder, although they'll be back there if Central Coast secure a point on Sunday against Western United.</p>
