      <h1>Marcus Rashford Can Go From Strength To Strength</h1>

      <p>With yet another goal-scoring performance from Marcus Rashford, Manchester United fans are starting to see the 22 year old striker flourish into a consistent contributor. There had been criticisms of Rashford’s game that went as far as saying that he was not able to lead the line in an accomplished manner, nor could the club rely upon him for regular goals. However, the England international is beginning to disprove that hypothesis with eight goals in his last eight matches in all competitions, for club and country.</p>

      <p>After Rashford added another goal and an assist to his name against Sheffield United, it takes him to seven goals and four assists in 13 Premier League appearances this season – somewhat leapfrogging his tally a year ago which read two goals and one assist.</p>
      <p>Being utilised mainly on the wing to allow Anthony Martial the ability to roam through the middle, Rashford has found immense joy in cutting inside with the ball at his feet and shooting, or floating inside as a support striker and finding space around the edge of the box.</p>
      <p>There are clear question marks regarding the consistency of Manchester United, as their performance at Bramhall Lane suggested that on Sunday evening, but when the team are on the front foot, Rashford comes alive.</p>
      <p>At 22, there is a lot of expectation place upon the Englishman’s shoulders, and it appears this is now the beginning of a potential mentality switch to suggest he can handle it.</p>
      <p>Two goals against Chelsea, one against Liverpool and an assist versus Arsenal also shows a trend of scoring important goals for the Red Devils. When others shy away – especially at a young age – Rashford comes to the fore and impacts those games. His first two Premier League goals came against the Gunners, as well as scoring a memorable goal at the Etihad.</p>

      <p>There is no doubt that Rashford needs help, and the re-introduction of Martial has done aided that enormously. Daniel James has been stellar this season for United in getting behind defences and causing trouble, which allows Rashford to peel off and find pockets of space to exploit for himself – instead of being so rigorously man-marked.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjær still finds himself under sizeable pressure as coach of the club and will need a huge change in fortunes over the Christmas period to get the fans back on side, with his best hope being the effectiveness of Rashford on a consistent basis.</p>
      <p>It might be early doors still, but the 22 year old is beginning to show his reliability on the grand stage on a consistent basis.  </p>
