      <p>Outspoken radio presenter and musician Ahmed Abubakar known in showbiz as Blakk Rasta has intimated that electorates are doing Africa a great disservice for electing Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo as president, despite being 75 years old – an age way beyond retirement.</p>
      <p>In an interview on Kofi TV, Blakk Rasta indicated that Mr. Akufo-Addo, together with his senior minister, Yaw Osafo-Maafo will keep sleeping on the job since they have refused to retire, stressing that they are too old hence, need to rest.</p>
      <p>“Nana Addo is too old to be president and that is very true. Whether you go to the heavens and come back to the earth, that is the truth… why is it that everyone has been given 60 years to retire whether you are a teacher, public servant in either Ghana or in some other countries but with Ghanaian politics, it doesn’t have a retirement age. Even a 200-year-old can be a president”.</p>
      <p>According to him, it takes a young brainy man to steer the affairs of a country therefore, electing an old man is wrong, to say the least.</p>
      <p>“To be a president is not a joke, it’s a very difficult thing to do. You’ll travel around the world just as Nana Addo is doing right now so if you love the old man, don’t push him to be doing things that young men are supposed to be doing,” he argued.</p>
      <p>The radio presenter further stated that the country will keep failing if young men in power keep slacking back to watch ‘the old men do the jobs all by themselves', especially travelling to look for deals that will make the economy better.</p>
      <p>While expressing optimism that Akufo-Addo will not vie for the presidency in 2020, Blakk Rasta posited that the leader of the Western Togoland, Charles Komi Kudzordzi who has been declared wanted by the police, took his inspiration to be a president from the first gentleman of the land.</p>
      <p>85-year-old Kudzordzi on Saturday, November 16, 2019 declared independence for the Volta and parts of the Northern, North Eastern and Upper East Regions.</p>
      <p>The separatists' group had over the years been demanding the secession of the above-mentioned areas from Ghana to become the Western Togoland state.</p>
