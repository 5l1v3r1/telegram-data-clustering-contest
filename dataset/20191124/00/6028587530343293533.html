      <p>Following the release of the amazing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2017/01/29/soul-of-chogokin-voltron-toy-review-the-mightiest-voltron-toy-of-them-all/">Soul of Chogokin GoLion</a> toy a few years back, Bandai Spirits has followed that up with an equally impressive <a href="https://tamashii.jp/item/12963/">Soul of Chogokin Dairugger XV</a> toy and it’s definitely something that will make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltron_(1984_TV_series)"><i>Voltron</i></a> fans very happy.To understand where <i>Voltron</i> comes from, you first need to take a look at two <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre">super robot</a> anime series from the early 80s. Namely that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beast_King_GoLion"><i>Beast King GoLion</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_Fleet_Dairugger_XV"><i>Armored Fleet Dairugger XV</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The first series, that of <i>GoLion</i>, featured a mecha that combined from five mechanical lions (hence the name, as “go” in Japanese means five). This series came Westward as <i>Voltron</i> and has gone on to create a huge fanbase in the years since.</p>
      <p>However, the second part of <i>Voltron’s</i> original narrative was taken from <i>Dairugger XV</i> and it’s here where the mecha changed.</p>
      <p>Specifically, instead of five mechanical lions being used, you now had an actual fleet of fifteen vehicles which would combine into the giant mecha, Dairugger XV.</p>
      <p>Much like how the first iteration of Voltron was often called Lion Voltron, the second season’s mecha was instead called Vehicle Voltron and it’s this toy that brings the classic design to life.</p>
      <p>Much like with <i>GoLion</i>, the mecha design was handled by a similar team for <i>Dairugger XV</i>. However, with the latter <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2018/11/05/yutaka-izubuchi-on-designing-the-most-popular-gundam-ever-and-his-love-of-kaiju/">Yutaka Izubuchi</a> was also involved.</p>
      <p>In this instance though, <i>Dairugger XV</i> was taking the whole combination or “gattai” setup further than ever before with its insane number of vehicles used to make the final mecha.</p>
      <p>In previous super robot shows of the 70s, you tended to reach a limit with around five vehicles to form a mecha. With shows like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%8Ddenji_Robo_Combattler_V"><i>Combattler V</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%8Ddenji_Machine_Voltes_V"><i>Voltes V</i></a> being good examples of this. So for <i>Dairugger XV</i> to feature fifteen vehicles was pretty excessive and definitely something that helped the design to stand out from the competition.</p>
      <p>That said, while <i>Dairugger XV</i> saw great popularity repackaged as <i>Voltron</i> in the West, the series didn’t fare so well in Japan, which is why it has taken this long for us to receive a proper Soul of Chogokin toy of the design.</p>
      <p>Like with other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_of_Chogokin">Soul of Chogokin</a> releases, this Dairugger XV toy is incredibly well done. There is obviously a lot of diecast used throughout but what’s impressive is how each of the vehicles that make up the mecha are recreated.</p>
      <p>In that, the sculpt and detailing are pristine for each of the vehicles. Furthermore, each of the vehicles have gimmicks and accessories of their own. From landing gear to bespoke antenna.</p>
      <p>You can also combine the various vehicles into the three interstitial forms of Dairugger XV, which is a nice touch.</p>
      <p>Once fully combined, it is a big and imposing toy. However, due to the number of component parts you need to be wary of its balance and general structural integrity.</p>
      <p>It is still a very sturdy toy that can hold a wide array of poses but while it is definitely a Soul of Chogokin release you can happily play with; it is obviously meant for collectors.</p>
      <p>That’s where we get to all the other accessories that come with this Dairugger XV toy. From a variety of hands, as well as effect parts and numerous weapons. You also get a nice stand to store all the extra parts and accessories.</p>
      <p>Much like the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2017/01/29/soul-of-chogokin-voltron-toy-review-the-mightiest-voltron-toy-of-them-all/">Soul of Chogokin GoLion</a> toy, this is an amazing update to a classic design. Not to mention something that fans who grew up watching <i>Voltron</i> during the 80’s will clearly love a great deal.</p>
      <p>However, this level of excellence doesn’t come cheap and this Soul of Chogokin Dairugger XV toy is priced at $339.99. Considering the size and complexity though, I was actually expecting this toy to cost an awful lot more.</p>
      <p>Overall, if you are an old school Voltron fan then this <a href="https://tamashii.jp/item/12963/">Soul of Chogokin Dairugger XV</a> is definitely something you should pick up, especially if you already have the <a href="https://tamashii.jp/item/11469/">Soul of Chogokin Voltron</a>. While this toy is expensive, you do get a lot for your money and you can now also happily say “And I’ll form…the head!” while assembling it.</p>
      <p>This Soul of Chogokin Dairugger XV costs $339.99 and it can be ordered via <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SH712ZH/">Amazon</a>.</p>
