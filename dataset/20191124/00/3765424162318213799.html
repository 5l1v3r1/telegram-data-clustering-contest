      <p>HARARE – A female lawyer representing business tycoon Frank Buyanga was allegedly abducted by suspected government agents in the latest twist to a child custody battle which has sucked in first lady, Auxillia Mnangagwa.</p>
      <p>The claim was made on Saturday by the Mauritius-headquartered African Medallion Group (AMG), a precious metals company Buyanga founded in 2017.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the company accused Mnangagwa of interference in a legal battle between Buyanga and his ex-girlfriend, Chantelle Muteswa, over the custody of their five-year-old son.</p>
      <p>Muteswa met President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s wife at State House on November 5, following which the first lady allegedly demanded Buyanga’s arrest by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission. She also allegedly advised Muteswa to file a corruption complaint against magistrates and judges who had ruled in Buyanga’s favour.</p>
      <p>AMG said the abduction was reported to Highlands Police Station “and until now no meaningful investigations have been made.”</p>
      <p>Police spokesman Paul Nyathi was not immediately available for comment on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“It is our view that this abduction may have been caused by the same elements trying to interfere with the judicial process. These tactics to attack our founder using his innocent five-year-old child and the mother to further their cause are in our view nothing less than cheap and inhumane,” AMG said in a statement.</p>
      <p>AMG said it was issuing a “stern warning that should anything happen to our founder Buyanga Sadiqi, we will hold members of the first family and all their agents fully accountable and responsible.”</p>
      <p>“This mischievous conduct and attempted interference by the state with the judiciary is one of a dictatorship and not a democracy ad undermines the constitution,” the company added.</p>
      <p>Buyanga and Muteswa have been embroiled in a messy legal battle over the custody of the child for more than a year. Buyanga has a pending High Court application for joint custody.</p>
      <p>Last week, the millionaire property tycoon was granted permission to obtain a new birth certificate and passport for the boy after Muteswa failed to list him as the father in the original birth certificate which saw the child being given her surname.</p>
