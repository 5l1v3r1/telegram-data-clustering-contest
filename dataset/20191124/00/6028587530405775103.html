      <p>Consider it the new California Gold Rush as developers are planning to forever change the massive dry desert land of Southern California. With numerous developments being created in the area, a new luxurious private residential development and surf park are planned to break ground with a 21-acre man-made lagoon in the Coachella Valley located 25 miles southeast of Palm Springs, California.</p>

      <p>The Riverside County planning commission recently approved plans for <a href="https://www.thermalbeachclub.com/">Thermal Beach Club </a>to be developed on Kohl Ranch, a 2,200-acre property in the area of Thermal in the Coachella Valley.</p>

      <p>The Kohl department store family owns <a href="https://www.regentproperties.com/kohl-ranch.html">Kohl Ranch</a>, the land where the surf club is being developed. Plans for the Thermal Beach Club property include 326 units on 210 resident lots, bungalows, villas and estates; a 16,000-square foot recreational center with a spa and exercise room; an 8,000-square foot pool and bar; a 4,500-square foot clubhouse restaurant with bar, retail shop, and kitchen.</p>
      <p>Designed as a high-end luxury community with five star resort amenities, the highlight of the Thermal Beach Club will be the surf lagoon, which will include wave-making technology to simulate ocean waves.</p>

      <p>The area is currently home to the Thermal Club, (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimdobson/2017/10/30/first-look-inside-the-outrageous-race-car-villas-at-californias-thermal-club/#11dee950211e">a location I covered exclusively when it was first opened</a>), a club and resort where wealthy race car owners buy memberships and build mansions around a private racing track.</p>

      <p>The new Thermal Beach Club project is being developed by WhiteStar Development LLC and will tap into existing water rights. The development will incorporate <a href="https://www.americanwavemachines.com/">American Wave Machines</a> PerfectSwell technology, which is also used at the 2-acre BSR Surf Resort in Texas. AWM is a major wave pool, surf venue, and wave technology brand and produces some of the most unique surf experiences in the world, including Montreal and Waco, Texas.</p>

      <p>According to AWM, “The PerfectSwell Phased Array Control System controls air pressure firing patterns and sequences to create unlimited wave types. It can easily generate ten large waves per minute — or a wave every six seconds. The waves generated by the PerfectSwell system measure an average of three to eight feet in height, with ride lengths limited only by pool size.” Surfing legend Kelly Slater’s famed Surf Ranch uses a different system, SurfStream, which is an endless standing wave made by continuously pumping water.</p>
      <p>The company documents that the vacant land allocated for the project includes sufficient water rights to provide for the 20-acre lagoon and the future option of adding 70 acres of additional Watersport lagoons. Once complete, there will be 326 units on 210 resident lots, a 16,000 square-foot recreational center with spa, and a 4,500 square foot clubhouse restaurant with bar and shops, including the addition of water features and wave pool.</p>

      <p>The adjacent areas to Coachella are also seeing an influx in water resorts, including the Palm Springs Surf Club, which is currently being built on the former Wet ‘n’ Wild water park off of Gene Autry Trail, a project financially backed by pro surfers.</p>
      <p>And nearby in Palm Desert, a $200 million surf resort recently was approved by the Palm Desert City Council, which will lead to the development of a project that includes a 5.5-acre wave lagoon, hotel, and residential villas at Desert Willow Golf Resort.</p>
