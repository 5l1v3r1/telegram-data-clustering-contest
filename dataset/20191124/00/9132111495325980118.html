      <p>The Ghana Aquaculture Stakeholders (GAS) has petitioned the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development (MOFAD), to take immediate action to safeguard aquaculture business activities by banning the importation of tilapia and illegal activities on the Volta Lake.</p>
      <p>According to the GAS, the increasing illegal activities by some foreign nationals are gradually collapsing the fishing industry which employs many fishers on the Volta Lake.</p>
      <p>GAS said its survey has revealed that fish farms in areas around the Volta Lake are currently faced with unprecedented challenges.</p>
      <p>GAS stated these when it presented a petition to the MOFAD.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Peace News, the Founder of Ghana Aquaculture Stakeholders, Patricia Safo said the government must ensure a comprehensive cleanup of the sector to stop illegal activities that are spreading disease and rapidly depleting the countryâ€™s fish reserves.</p>
      <p>Patricia Safo added that more than 60% of fish farming along the Volta Lake have collapsed due to such illegal activities on the Volta Lake.</p>
      <p>She said hundreds of the youth in the area have also lost their jobs hence the need for government intervention.</p>
      <p>Receiving the petition the Deputy Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development, Kingsley Ato Cudjoe assured the GAS that government will give serious attention to the concerns of GAS.</p>
      <p>Hon Ato Cudjoe said upon coming into power from 2017 the NPP government has taken measures to promote aquaculture in the country.</p>
      <p>He said government through MOFAD will implement the Aquaculture for Food and Jobs program from 2020 to increase fish production and create more job opportunities for the people.</p>
