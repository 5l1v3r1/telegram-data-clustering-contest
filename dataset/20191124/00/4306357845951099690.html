      <h3>Unai Emery has insisted that Lucas Torreira has a “very big future” at Arsenal.</h3>
      <p>The 23-year-old has struggled to hold down a regular spot in the first team at The Emirates this season and he had only started four Premier League games heading into this weekend’s round of fixtures.</p>
      <p>Torreira is a firm favourite amongst Gunners fans and Arsenal supporters are likely to be keen to see more of the Uruguay international in action in the coming weeks and months.</p>
      <p>Emery has been playing Torreira in a more advanced midfield role for Arsenal this season.</p>
      <p>And the Gunners boss has now revealed that he held talks with the young midfielder to help him improve his game in the lead-up to Saturday’s clash with Southampton at The Emirates.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/lucas-torreira-big-future-arsenal-insists-unai-emery-11204681/">Metro</a>, Emery said: “I spoke with him yesterday and today. I showed him some movies about his best performances with us and how he can improve.</p>
      <p>“First, he is young. His process here is starting. He started playing in the Premier League last year and he progressed, but this year again he needs to progress.</p>
      <p>“He is a very good player, important for us, and his focus needs to be with us 100 per cent. His response to me was positive, this morning and yesterday, and then we showed how he can improve for our capacity of our necessary tactical movement.</p>
      <p>“He’s a good player for us, he has very big commitment and very good behaviour.</p>
      <p>“He has a very big future here but thinking he needs to improve. He has to learn in some situations, individually to help us, to do better. It’s one process.”</p>
      <p>Torreira will be hoping to hold down a more regular role in the first team at Arsenal in the coming weeks and months as the Gunners look to try and get their bid for Champions League qualification back on track.</p>
      <p>The north London side are aiming to try and break back into the top four this season after they finished in fifth place and without a trophy last term.</p>
