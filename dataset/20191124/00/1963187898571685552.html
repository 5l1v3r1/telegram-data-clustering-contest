      <p>CAIRO - 24 November 2019: "Uber will continue its investment contributions in Egypt by expanding Uber Bus operations into under-served communities, keeping bus prices low to continue making the service affordable and accessible for all users," Senior Director and GM of Uber Middle East and Africa Anthony Le Roux said. <br/><br/>“We are deeply gratified to hear the President’s appreciation for Uber’s social and economic impact," Le Roux added, commenting on President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi’s speech during the investors’ round-table held in Africa 2019 Conference. <br/><br/>Le Roux explained that the company initially launched Uber Bus as a global-first in Egypt in response to the president’s request. “We are proud to be exporting the product to two other countries,” Le Roux revealed. <br/><br/>President Sisi said Saturday that he had talked with representatives of Uber Company to provide mass transportation service in Egypt amid new legislative laws being drafted by the government to facilitate the work of foreign transportation companies in Egypt. <br/><br/>Egypt’s Africa 2019 Conference kicked off on Friday under President Sisi’s auspices, with the participation of more than 2,000 international businesspersons, economic experts and entrepreneurs from Egypt and African countries. The two-day conference was held in the New Administrative Capital.</p>
