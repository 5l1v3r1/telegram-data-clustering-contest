      <p>Flood hit areas are bracing for more heavy rain as the Met Office issues weather warnings for the next five days.</p>
      <p>As Saturday’s rain cleared north into Scotland and northern England, south west England and south Wales are preparing for downpours over the coming days – with yellow weather warnings in place in the region from Sunday until Wednesday.</p>
      <p>By midweek, the East Midlands and South Yorkshire are also expecting a deluge, on top of the ground already flooded earlier this month, with a yellow weather warning, and the possibility of flooding, already in place.</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, the Army was called in to assist stricken communities after towns and villages around Doncaster and Sheffield and parts of the Midlands were drenched by heavy downpours.</p>
      <p>Doncaster Council said more than 900 homes and businesses in the town were affected by the rain earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Met Office weather forecaster Alex Burkill said on Saturday evening: “The heavy rain that affected parts of England today has moved north and it’s mainly across Scotland right now.</p>
      <p>“That’s where we’ve got the warning for tonight, and the heaviest rain and greatest impacts will be there.”</p>

      <p>On Saturday morning, firefighters in Devon and Cornwall warned drivers to stay away from flooded roads after a number of calls overnight to stranded cars.</p>
      <p>Photographs showed flash flooding in areas such as Clyst St Mary in Exeter.</p>
      <p>Seven flood warnings are in place across England and Wales on Saturday, alongside 60 less severe flood alerts.</p>

      <p>Mr Burkill added: “Across the next five days we have got warnings for each [day].</p>
      <p>“[On Wednesday] it’s covering that area of Yorkshire and Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, that area which saw the severe flooding.</p>
      <p>“At the moment, the rainfall is not expected to be particularly heavy for the time of year, but we are expecting it to be significant.</p>
      <p>“There are likely to be some impacts.”</p>
