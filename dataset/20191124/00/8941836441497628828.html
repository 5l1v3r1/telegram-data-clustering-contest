      <h1>Josh Norman active, Chris Thompson out for Redskins against Lions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/matthew-paras/" target="_blank">Matthew Paras</a></address>
      <p>LANDOVER — The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-redskins/">Washington Redskins</a> reversed course Sunday, deciding to make cornerback Josh Norman active after contemplating making him a healthy scratch against the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/detroit-lions/">Detroit Lions</a>. </p>
      <p>Multiple reports the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-redskins/">Redskins</a> had planned to scratch Norman, but when the team announced its inactives list Sunday, the 31-year-old was not among them.</p>
      <p>Norman had been listed as questionable on Friday with a hamstring injury. It is still possible the cornerback could see limited playing time and Washington could potentially start rookie Jimmy Moreland in his place. </p>
      <p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-redskins/">Redskins</a> defensive coordinator Greg Manusky said he didn’t know why Norman was struggling this season. </p>
      <p>“Couldn’t tell you why, you got to ask him,” Manusky said. “I think from our situation, we’re putting him in situations to make some plays, and we’re just not making the plays. Sometimes that’s across the board as well on a lot of other players too.” </p>

      <p>With Norman active, here is who is out for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-redskins/">Redskins</a>:</p>
      <p>- Running back Chris Thompson (toe)</p>
      <p>- Wide receiver Cam Sims</p>
      <p>- Quarterback Colt McCoy</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>- Defensive lineman Daron Payne (ankle)</p>
        <p>- Center Ross Pierschbacher </p>
        <p>- Cornerback Aaron Colin</p>
        <p>- Safety Jeremy Reaves </p>
        <p>Thompson had returned to practice during the week, but did not make enough progress to suit up against the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/detroit-lions/">Lions</a>. </p>
