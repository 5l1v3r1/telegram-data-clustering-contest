      <p>"I think we can confirm that the Sumatran rhino is now extinct in Malaysia," he added.</p>
      <p>Malaysia's last male Sumatran rhino died in May this year. Tam also had lived in the same nature reserve with Iman on Borneo island in Malaysia's Sabah state.</p>
      <p>John Payne, executive director of Borneo Rhino Alliance said the Sumatran rhinos have been hard hit by factors including changes in climate, vegetation and hunting for traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
