      <h1>Mark Stoops Comments On The Florida State Job Rumors</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:34:02+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 00:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Florida State is still going through the process of trying to find its next head coach. Rumors continue to swirl regarding coaching candidates. Top names have emerged during the search – Mark Stoops being one of the names associated.</p>
      <p>The Kentucky head coach had little time to celebrate the Wildcats’ 50-7 blowout victory over the Tennesseee-Martin Skyhawks on Saturday. Stoops had to offer a response to a question regarding the Florida State opening after the game.</p>
      <p>He’s clearly committed to Kentucky football.</p>
      <blockquote>“This is where my heart is, this is where I’m going to be,” Stoops said, via <a href="https://twitter.com/JonHale_CJ/status/1198391999327457280">Jon Hale of the Courier Journal</a>. “I’m going to be at Kentucky.”</blockquote>

      <p>This is certainly a sigh of relief for Kentucky fans. Losing Stoops would be a major setback for a program with an upward trajectory. Reports surfaced earlier today about Stoops withdrawing his name from consideration and he appears <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/mark-stoops-interviewed-florida-state-job">to have confirmed that</a>.</p>
      <p>Stoops led Kentucky to an incredible 10-win season last year. The Wildcats have taken a step back this season, but there’s still a lot to like about where the team is heading.</p>
      <p>Kentucky earned its sixth win of the season on Saturday to reach bowl eligibility. Stoops and the Wildcats will have a chance to reach seven wins next week against the Louisville Cardinals.</p>
      <p>For now, it looks like Florida State will have to look elsewhere for its next head coach.</p>
