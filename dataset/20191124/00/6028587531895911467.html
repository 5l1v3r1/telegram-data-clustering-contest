      <h1>The Gateway Arch is a Tourist Must-do</h1>

      <p>There are some tourist experiences that need doing, such as walking the Sydney Harbour Bridge or going up the Eiffel Tower or the Empire State Building. And when in St, Louis, you’ve got to go up in the Arch, America’s tallest man-made monument, a catenary curve 630 feet up in the air, as wide as it is high.</p>

      <p>Truth to tell, I’d gone to the top of the Gateway arch almost thirty years ago. All I really recall is being seated in a capsule that made me feel like Laika, the dog sent into space by the Soviets. The trip to the top of the Arch is more memorable now (if no more comfortable), and not just because of all the brain-enhancing blueberries I’ve consumed since then.</p>
      <p>First a little background: During the Depression in the 1930s, St. Louis civic leaders first had the idea of creating a great public monument dedicated to Westward Expansion that would revive the riverfront area and stimulate the local economy by creating construction jobs. Initial funding was used to acquire land and condemn riverfront homes with plans for a park to be built above the riverfront railroad tracks.</p>
      <p>Following World War Two, a competition was held in 1947 for the design of the monument. Among the architects who submitted plans were Richard Neutra, Charles Nagel, Jr, Fiske Kimball and Finnish architect Eero Saarinen and, separately his father Eliel Saarinen. On May 25, 1947, Eero Saarinen won the competition with his innovative and iconic steel arch.</p>
      <p>It would take another twenty years, however, before the Gateway Arch would be completed. In that time, US interstate 44 was built, passing through the riverfront area, and effectively cordoning off the memorial to its own area. Ground was broken in late 1959 and early 1960, and construction began on February 12, 1963.  According to the Gateway Arch’s own press information, The Arch weighs 17,246 tons. The 142 stainless-steel sections used to build the Arch required almost 900 tons of stainless steel. The final piece was set in place on October 28, 1965 as Vice-President Hubert Humphrey observed from a helicopter nearby. The Arch finally opened on May 25, 1968, dedicated by Humphrey.</p>
      <p>When I first visited the Arch in the early 1990s, you actually entered the arch through one of its legs and boarded the tram to the top there. I don’t remember if I visited the museum then, but from what I’m told it covered only 100 years of history and most of it was a very Caucasian-centric Manifest Destiny-informed peroration on the wonders of U.S. territorial expansion. But that was then.</p>
      <p>The Arch itself remains a wonder. As you drive downtown during the day, it peeks out from behind buildings, a gleaming presence. At night it glows different colors like some spaced-out mood ring.</p>
      <p>  Over the last five years, the Arch and its surroundings has undergone a $380 Million renovation that includes a new museum, as well as parkland with walking and biking paths and an outdoor amphitheater, all of which finally covers the Interstate as Saarinen originally intended, connecting the Arch to downtown St. Louis.</p>
      <p> You now enter from the park and descend from a gently sloping plaza into the visitor’s greeting area. On the day I visited I was fortunate to tag along on a museum tour given by Erin Hilligoss-Volkmann, a Park Ranger and the Director of Education at the Gateway Arch National Park who was as enthusiastic as she was well-informed and affable.</p>
      <p> The new space below ground features a new museum with six galleries as well as a snack bar, restrooms and a gift shop. There is even a private event space available for rental.</p>
      <p>The 46,000 square feet of new museum exhibition The Museum features six exhibit galleries: Colonial St. Louis, Jefferson’s Vision, The Riverfront Era, Manifest Destiny, New Frontiers and Building the Arch. The new museum was designed with “Universal Design” principles, a standard that exceeds the Americans for Disabilities Act (ADA) standards to create an environment accessible for people of all abilities. At various moments, the galleries offer up ways for all who visit to engage, with exhibit elements featuring sounds, smells, items that can be touched or experienced. As one walks through the museum there are a series of informative islands that are designed for wheelchair access.</p>
      <p>  So, for example, there is the entrance to a 200-year-old stone building, called the Old Rock House, that Meriwether Lewis once used as his office, that was taken apart and reassembled in the museum that one can touch.</p>
      <p> As one crisscross from gallery to gallery, walking through the history of St. Louis, one learns of the French Fur traders and the Native Americans of the Osage Nation who were its first inhabitants, of how St. Louis became the launch place and supply provider for expeditions west – and we get some idea of those trips. Among the items on view at the Museum are fur trade items and French colonial artifacts, a collection of rare Presidential Peace Medals given to Native American leaders as tokens of treaties, a stagecoach, an original 1840 Book of Mormon, a reproduction of War Cloud’s war shirt, and a model of the St, Louis wharf and how the many Steamboats that docked there.</p>
      <p> At the same time, the museum does a commendable job of creating a more inclusive, less Euro-centric narrative that also tells the story of the indigenous native residents as well as of women and persons of color, before, during, and after the Civil War.</p>
      <p> Special attention is given to how “Manifest Destiny” was embraced by the United States government as the justification for confiscation of lands, displacing civilian local populations, and the wholesale expulsion and murder of indigenous civilian populations. And how what seemed to white Americans as ordained by God was seen as stealing their land and genocide by the Mexican government and Native American Nations.</p>
      <p> The new Museum highlights the contributions of women, presents the Mormon’s plight through the lens of tolerance for other religions, and details Native American culture and history as part of the story of St. Louis, Missouri and the nation.</p>
      <p> However, by the last gallery we are focused on the Arch itself – the competition and Eeno Saarinen’s winning design, and the long history of its eventual construction.</p>
      <p> There is even a special structure in the tram lobby that allows visitors who can not ride to the top (the tram is not wheelchair accessible) to experience the top of the arch through a live webcam from the observation deck.</p>
      <p> As for the tram experience itself, it is well organized. Each capsule has five seats and there are eight capsules in each tram (there are trams on both sides of the Arch, although on the day I visited only one side was in operation).</p>

      <p> I happened to be on one of the last tram rides of the day.  It is small and crowded but in fairness five people sit comfortably enough inside what still seems like half a tin can. The doors are glass but the view as one rises up the arch is nothing other than the insides – and not of much engineering or architectural interest. Every so often the capsule recalibrates during its ascent – like the cabs in a ferris wheel, but that’s about as exciting as it gets.</p>
      <p> However, once one exits and walks up to the observation deck, it is definitely worth the trip. You are standing 630 feet above ground and the views are spectacular.</p>
      <p>I happened to be on one of the last tram rides of the day. There are 16 windows on each side. However, as I stood in the observation deck, the Sun began to set adding a red ribbon to the West- facing vista. Looking West over downtown St. Louis one sees the Park’s design and the Old Courthouse, and to the left is the new Busch Stadium (home of the much beloved Cardinals) aglow in lights.</p>
      <p>Standing at the top of the Arch and looking out over St. Louis is one of those tourist experiences that is not overrated. Looking out the windows of the observation deck at the city below and the ever-receding horizon, you can’t help but agree with the words of the man whose statue stands outside the entrance to Busch Stadium, Cardinals legend Stan Musial that, “I have no hesitation to say that St. Louis is a great place in which to live and work” – or visit.</p>
