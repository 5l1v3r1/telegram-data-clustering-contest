        <b>Lucas di Grassi says that his Audi team's decision to 'flip his car overnight' contributed to his first podium finish of the season at the second Diriyah Formula E race.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Di Grassi finished 13th in the first race, having struggled to make significant inroads from 19th on the grid after being stuck in the first qualifying group.</p>
      <p>But an overnight change in setup aboard his car, paired with a berth in the third qualifying group, meant di Grassi could take greater advantage of the evolving street course in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian driver converted his third-place grid spot into third in the race, which became second after Maximilian Guenther's time penalty for overtaking under yellow flags.</p>
      <p>"We flipped the car overnight," explained di Grassi, "to try to find performance yesterday where we struggled a lot.</p>
      <p>"Even in the race, we didn't have the pace but today was much better in the race. In the end, the race we had a good pace, we're saving the energy."</p>

      <p>When asked what kind of work Audi's overnight changes entailed, di Grassi refused to be drawn on the specifics - but suggested that it covered a range of suspension setup changes.</p>
      <p>"I cannot go into a lot of detail of course," di Grassi told Autosport. "You work on anything from suspension geometry, springs, anti-roll bars, ride height, if you are expecting certain performance [which] is not there.</p>
      <p>"It's not like F1 or LMP1 where you have Friday night to analyse data, Saturday, everything [in Formula E] happens very quickly, so if you have something wrong with your car, it's very hard to find.</p>
      <p>"So we took a chance, we tried stuff that we thought would work today and from FP3, so from this morning, we're already much faster.</p>
      <p>"So that shows that with the same car you can find a lot of performance going from one race to another.</p>
      <p>"We managed to put it in the right direction today, we're relatively quick, not the best car on the grid of course, [but] much better than yesterday."</p>
