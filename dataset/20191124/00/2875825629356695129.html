      <p>Rafa Nadal inspired Spain to reach the Davis Cup final with two breathtaking wins over Great Britain last night.</p>
      <p>Amid raucous scenes in Madrid's Magic Box, the world No.1 won his 28th consecutive singles match in this competition against Dan Evans 6-4 6-0 to draw the semi-final level.</p>
      <p>And the Spanish superstar returned to court to win a late-night doubles decider with Feliciano Lopez. The two veteran left-handers beat Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski 7-6 7-6 in a match which finished at 12.35 am local time.</p>
      <p>The British pair had four set points in the second tiebreak but local boy Lopez secured the second match point when Skupski could not return another howitzer serve.</p>
      <p>Andy Murray, who was again dropped from the side, could hardly watch his brother play and bit his nails throughout a tense encounter which ended in heroic defeat for Leon Smith's side.</p>

      <p>Nadal has won a magnificent seven matches at the revamped Davis Cup this week and ensured the new-look competition is a success.</p>
      <p>He was not perfect though as he ranted at umpire Marijana Veljovic for refusing a challenge in the second set tiebreak.</p>
      <p>Asked about the performance of world No.1 Nadal, Evans said: “I thought he was pretty good.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, Kyle Edmund accused the Spanish of dirty tricks after a late change to their line-up just before this opening singles match.</p>

      <p>Left-hander Lopez replaced the injured Pablo Carreno Busta after the teams had been officially announced – and just five minutes before the players walked out on court.</p>
      <p>The ruse backfired as Edmund won his third consecutive match 6-3 7-6.</p>
      <p>“On paper maybe they didn't do anything wrong,” said Edmund. “But if you say about this spirit, it's professional sport, this is why we always talk about these things. It happens in football, little mind games.”</p>
      <p>Dan Evans added: “It's a little naughty, I'd say. To be honest, if you name a team, we just think that's going to be the team.”</p>

      <p>Despite the LTA giving away 800 free tickets at the cost of £60,000, there was overwhelming support for the home side in the Spanish capital.</p>
      <p>“I knew it was going to be loud out there,” said Edmund. "I had to be really, really focused and concentrate on myself.”</p>
      <p>Canada will face Spain in their first ever Davis Cup final after Denis Shapovalov won his singles match against Andrey Rublev.</p>
      <p>And the blond world No.15 teamed up with Vasek Pospisil to clinch the winning point in the doubles in a dramatic third-set tiebreak 3-6 7-6 against Rublev and Karen Khachenov.</p>
      <p>“I think it's every tennis player's dream to play in Davis Cup final,” said the 20-year-old.</p>
