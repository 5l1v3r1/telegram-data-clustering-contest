      <h3>Sommer Ray Pulls On A Piece of Chewed Bubble Gum Caught Between Her Teeth As She Poses In A Sexy Pink Ensemble</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/sommer-ray/">Sommer Ray</a> likes to have fun while she <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5753863/sommer-ray-bodacious-booty/">models for photos</a>. In her most recent <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> upload shared on November 23, the 23-year-old athletic model posed in two similar pictures, with the second shot less former than the first.</p>
      <p>Sommer wore a pink, one-piece ensemble in both images. The pink garment, which resembles lingerie but is likely a swimsuit, was cut up extremely high on the beauty’s thigh, almost reaching waist level. The back of her sartorial statement for Saturday dipped down low as Sommer stood with her back to the camera while she twisted her body to face front for the two poses.</p>
      <p>Her luscious, multi-toned mane was gathered up on the top of her head, held together with a rose-colored scrunchie. The long tresses hit at bosom level as her hair grazed her breasts in the first social media image.</p>
      <p>Her expression in that image was a bit coy as her face full of makeup was appealing. She rocked groomed brows, pink shadow and highlighter, prominent black mascara, and a natural pout. Small gold hoop earrings, a couple of bracelets, a gold choker, and a bunch of rings on the fingers of her hand grazed her upper thigh, adding a bit of bling to her look.</p>
      <p>Sommer’s stance in the second picture of the pack was a lot looser than the first. The popular Instagram model goofed around as she bit on a piece of chewed bubble gum that she held between her teeth, pulling the stretchable substance with her hand while she laughed at her fun-loving effort. Her thick hair flew forward as she bent her head to do her bubble gum bit, adding an amusing element to the otherwise stagnant photo session.</p>

      <p>From among Sommer’s 23.1 million fans and followers, while more than 1,800 of them commented on the entertaining and sexy Instagram post. Many used emoji like flames, heart-eye faces, and red hearts to convey their thoughts while other expressed themselves in phrases and sentences, with at least a few admirers asking Sommer for her hand in marriage. Others were more realistic.</p>
      <p>“Pink is my favorite color,” mused one Instagram user.</p>

      <p>“Love from Greece,” stated a second fan, who added a red heart emoji.</p>
      <p>“Wedgie goddess,” commented a third admirer, who apparently noticed that Sommer’s pink outfit was caught between her legs.</p>
      <p>“Next time more plz these brighten my day,” said a fourth fan, who was not shy while asking Sommer to post pictures on Instagram more often than she has been posting.</p>
