      <h1>Dan Osborne takes son Teddy to Arsenal as he makes Jacqueline Jossa trial plea</h1>
      <h2>The fed-up former EastEnders star will take on the Crevice of Cruelty with Ian Wright on Sunday but unhappy Dan has had enough of seeing his brave wife suffer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:24:22+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 00:24</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>It was probably a good way to distract them both from what's going on over on the other side of the world.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dan-osborne-towie-fame-13054898">Dan Osborne</a> took son Teddy, five, to see Arsenal - and it was a great chance to get their mind off the Jugle.</p>
      <p>His wife Jacqueline Jossa is doing well in Australia but the relentless Bushtucker trials are adding strain.</p>
      <p>Not that the Gunners-mad reality star was given too much to smile about at the football.</p>
      <p>Arsenal were booed off against lowly Southampton after scraping a 2-2 Premier League draw six minutes into injury time.</p>

      <p>Dan later appealed for the British public to stop voting for Jacqueline, who he shares daughters Ella, four, and Mia 17 months, with.</p>
      <p>The ex-EastEnder will take on the Crevice of Cruelty with Ian Wright but ticked off Dan has had enough of seeing her suffer.</p>
      <p>He said on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> : “I know I said to you all to vote for Jac because she isn’t in there to change lightbulbs, I didn’t mean every singe trial.</p>
      <p>"Give her a break now, come on.</p>

      <p>"She’s worried about it but she keeps smashing them all. She’ll keep proving everyone wrong.</p>
      <p>"She’s doing it with Ian Wright too, which is good. He’ll look after her.</p>
      <p>"Let her do this one and then just give her a break please because she’s getting upset now and it ain’t nice. But she’ll be good, she’ll smash it.</p>
      <p>"She’ll get all the stars and head back to camp with meals.”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Andrew Maxwell broke down in tears and threatened to walk out on Saturday's I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>The comedian confessed he had "hit a wall" as he became "overwhelmed" with jungle life.</p>
      <p>Andrew said: "I honestly thought that I was gonna walk out, but I haven’t, when you’re tired, you just say ‘have I done the right thing’."</p>
