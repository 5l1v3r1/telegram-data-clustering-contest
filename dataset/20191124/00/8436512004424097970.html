      <h1>Miners unfazed by bitcoin price plunge</h1>
      <h2>The hash rate, which is the amount of computing power needed to run the network, is as strong as ever</h2>

      <p>Bitcoin miners are not capitulating despite the price of the leading cryptocurrency’s price plunging over 15% in the past week, new data indicates.</p>
      <p>According to estimates of bitcoin’s hash rate from monitoring resource <a href="https://coin.dance/blocks/hashrate/linear">Coin Dance</a>, participation remains as strong now as before the price drop, Cointelegraph reported. <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/hash-rate/">Hash rate</a> refers to the amount of computing power dedicated to maintaining the bitcoin network.</p>
      <h3>2nd all-time high</h3>
      <p>According to some measures, the hash rate on November 23, in fact, nearly matched its previous all-time high. At 134 quintillion hashes per second, Saturday’s reading was almost identical to the one recorded on October 10.</p>

      <p>BTC/USD traded at around $7,200 on that day, compared to $8,600 in October.</p>
      <p>Previously, Cointelegraph reported on the rising consensus that Bitcoin miners were exiting their positions as losses mounted. According to statistician Willy Woo, that process was nearing completion this week.</p>
      <p>Taking an opposing position based on the fresh data, entrepreneur Alistair Milne suggested miners were not very concerned about the current price action.</p>
      <p>“There is NO miner capitulation,” he tweeted on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“They are acutely aware of the upcoming halving and are apparently unphased by the recent dip.”</p>

      <p>Milne also linked it to the increasing difficulty in mining bitcoin, an indicator that had been in decline until recently.</p>
      <p>Mining difficulty is a measure of the effort required to solve bitcoin block equations that regularly changes in accordance with shifting miner sentiment. Earlier this month, miners experienced their biggest drop of the year – 7%. Since then, a roughly 2% uptick likewise contradicts the idea that miners are staying away, according to <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/">Blockchain</a> figures.</p>
      <p>For analyst PlanB, creator of the highly-popular <a href="https://coinrivet.com/guides/cryptocurrencies/how-to-predict-bitcoins-future-value-using-the-stock-to-flow-model/">stock-to-flow</a> bitcoin price model, difficulty trends also point to continued faith in mining profitability.</p>
      <p>“+2% difficulty adjustment: no miner capitulation,” tweeted on Friday, adding that the historical precedent called for a price rise after such behavior.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://diff.cryptothis.com/">Crypto This</a>’s real-time difficulty generator, the next adjustment on December 5 could be almost 5% higher than current levels.</p>
      <p>Unlike difficulty, the hash rate is challenging to accurately estimate and should therefore not be taken as a definitive guide to miner involvement.</p>
      <p>A steady increase in computing power indicates that the reduction of bitcoin price does not stop miners, <a href="https://newslogical.com/bitcoin-hash-rate-back-above-100eh-s-despite-drop-in-btc-price/">NewsLogical</a> reported. Although at this stage, cryptocurrency mining on some ASIC models is already unprofitable. For example, the <a href="https://newslogical.com/antminer-s9-may-chicken-out-if-bitcoin-price-drop-below-7500/">break-even point</a> of the Antminer S9 is $7,500. Miners are probably betting on a long-term price rebound due to the 2020 <a href="https://coindiligent.com/2020-bitcoin-halving-facts">halving</a>.</p>
