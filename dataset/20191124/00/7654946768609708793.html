      <p>It’s bribery, teachers say.</p>
      <p>Steven Schwartz, principal of PS 24 in the Bronx, is so eager for praise he offered a quid pro quo to teachers who show up at a public meeting next Tuesday to make their Riverdale school — and him — look good.</p>
      <p>Teachers who attend may get letters of commendation in their files — and two free “prep” periods away from their classrooms.</p>
      <p>Schwartz, already in hot water for <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/06/02/principal-accused-of-gambling-on-horse-races-during-school-hours/">posting hundreds of tweets on horse racing</a> last school year, blasted an email Wednesday to staff titled “Friendly Reminder – Huge Incentives.”</p>
      <p>In the email, obtained by The Post, Schwartz urges staff to attend a 6:30 p.m. meeting of the District 10 Community Education Council. PS 24 is hosting the meeting next Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“It would be greatly appreciated if members of our staff could join together and show the outside community how united and strong PS 24 is despite the past turmoil,” he said, referring to multiple complaints <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/08/bronx-principal-could-face-another-investigation-over-gambling-tweets/">about his gambling habit</a> and alleged mismanagement.</p>
      <p>Schwartz invited all staff who attend to “go out for a bite” beforehand.</p>
      <p>“Please let me know if you can attend this important event,” noting the night would feature presentations showcasing PS 24’s “hard work and successes.”</p>
      <p>“Letters to file. . . will be considered for your support, dedication and time,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>“In addition, I will be providing 2 additional preps to any staff members willing to show up and support their school and fellow colleagues. Please RSVP.”</p>
      <p>A prep is a period in which teachers get free time to prepare lessons. Substitutes or other faculty members must cover their classrooms, thus costing extra city dollars.</p>
      <p>Later Wednesday, Schwartz dangled another bonus in an email telling staff to urge parents to attend the meeting as well. “I am also offering the grade with the most parents/staff in attendance extra recess,” he said.</p>
      <p>Some staffers don’t like what they call pressure to make a show of their support to curry favor with the boss — or face possible repercussions.</p>
      <p>“That’s not in the nature of a teacher to do,” one said. “Otherwise, they’d be politicians and not teachers.”</p>
      <p>Another said Schwartz wants staff and parents to fill seats. “He’s trying to show that people are in favor of him despite all the negative press that we’ve had.”</p>
      <p>Teacher Walter Rendon blasted the deal as “bribery” in an email to DOE officials Saturday, writing: “Mr. Schwartz is hoping to present himself in a good light” for district superintendent Maribel Torres-Hulla. Schwartz did not return messages seeking comment.</p>
      <p>DOE spokeswoman Danielle Filson said, “All staff are always welcome and encouraged to attend CEC meetings to stay engaged with their communities. We’re looking into the language used in the letter.”</p>
