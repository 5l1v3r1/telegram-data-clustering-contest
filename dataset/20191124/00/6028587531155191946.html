      <p>The best explanation for the Portland Trail Blazers’ struggles can be found in the start of a quote from point guard Damian Lillard following their <a href="https://stats.nba.com/game/0021900231/">114-110 loss to Cleveland</a> on Saturday.“We’re really small right now,” Lillard <a href="https://www.nba.com/blazers/news/long-trip-gets-even-longer-loss-cavaliers">told reporters</a> after Portland lost to a Cleveland team that had dropped six games in a row and lost by 42 points to Dallas the night before.</p>
      <p>Lillard was not speaking metaphorically in the <i>we’re not coming up big </i>sense. The Blazers are literally too small, with a recent starting lineup that has the 6-foot-2 Lillard and 6-3 CJ McCollum playing with three 6-8 players in Rodney Hood, Anthony Tolliver and Carmelo Anthony, all of whom are natural small forwards. The lack of size has been a major reason Portland has been able to win just twice in 12 November games.</p>
      <p>A team that started the season with five players who are 6-foot-10 or taller on its roster had just one in its last two games in the 6-10 Skal Labisseire. Injuries are part of any NBA season, but they have really hit the Blazers in the post, with Jusuf Nurkic yet to play because of the compound leg fracture he suffered in March, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/miketokito/2019/11/06/4-month-prognosis-for-zach-collins-is-a-major-blow-for-trail-blazers/#343a9e4f1548">Zach Collins out until least February</a> after shoulder surgery, Pau Gasol waived after he was unable to recover from foot surgery, and Hassan Whiteside missing the last two games because of a right hip injury.</p>
      <p>In the modern NBA, teams focus their defenses on limiting 3-point shots and points in the paint, the two most efficient ways to score. Portland limits its opponents to 29.4 percent of their points on 3-pointers, which ranks No. 4 in the NBA. That work, though, is undone by the Blazers’ inability to control to lane.</p>
      <p>The Blazers are giving up an average of 49.4 points in the paint, which ranks 21<sup>st</sup> in the league, while scoring 42 per game in the lane themselves. The 7.4 deficit is a major reversal from last season, when Portland averaged 48.4 points in the paint per game while giving up 47.8.</p>
      <p>The deficit in points inside means the Blazers have to get a big advantage in 3-pointers to win. Against the Cavaliers, Portland had a 14-10 advantage in made 3-pointers, but Cleveland scored 50 points in the paint to Portland’s 36. In the previous game against one of the league’s elite teams, Milwaukee, the Blazers made 17 3-pointers against the Bucks’ 16, but Milwaukee had a huge advantage in points in the paint, 64-36.</p>
      <p>The Blazers have been especially vulnerable to offensive rebounds. They rank second-to-last in the NBA in allowing 12.2 offensive rebounds per game, and are dead last in allowing second-chance points at 16.8 per game, a full 1.5 more than No. 29 Memphis, and 3.1 more than they allowed last season.</p>
      <p>Portland’s deficit in second-chance points has been especially glaring the last two games, with Cleveland finishing with a 14-3 advantage and Milwaukee 27-9. That’s just way too many points to spot to any NBA team.</p>
      <p>Certainly Whiteside, who is averaging 14.9 points and 12.0 rebounds, should help when he gets healthy. Labissiere has shown flashes of the player he could become (22 points, 12 rebounds against Milwaukee), but at 216 pounds, is not yet a physical presence in the lane. If the Blazers are going to climb out of the No. 14 spot in the Western Conference and the 5-12 record that is their worst 17-game start in 12 years, they need help inside, especially with Nurkic and Collins months from returning.</p>
