      <p>The new 16-inch MacBook Pro and Dell’s 2019 XPS 15 are arguably the two best big-screen laptops. I have both laptops in-house and here are some brief impressions.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Keyboard: if you care a lot about about the keyboard....</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 16-inch MacBook Pro’s keyboard is a regression back to the old scissor-switch design. That said, it’s Apple’s way of saying that the newfangled Butterfly keyboard failed and the older keyboard design is, in fact, better.</p>
      <p>I spent some time doing comparison typing on the latest 13-inch MacBook Pro (with the latest Butterfly keyboard) and the new MBP 16: the difference was stark. Stark enough that you might want to get the MBP 16 just for the keyboard if that matters a lot to you. In short, better travel and tactile feedback translate into a more pleasant typing experience.</p>
      <p>The XPS 15 has the same keyboard Dell has been using for a while. It’s nothing to rave about (so-so tactile feedback) but it gets the job done. The carbon fiber palm rest is a great touch, setting it apart from the pack.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Trackpad: 2x the size</b>
      </p>
      <p>And for those who care about the size of the trackpad, you’ll notice in the photo at bottom that the MacBook Pro has a trackpad that is roughly twice the size of the XPS. To be honest, I don’t know if that’s a good or bad thing.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Display: Dell wins</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is huge for both laptops. For Apple, obviously because it’s upped the display size to 16 inches from 15.4 inches and shrunk the bezels in the process. For Dell because it comes with a drop-dead gorgeous AMOLED display.</p>
      <p>Dell’s OLED wins.</p>
      <p>AMOLED displays are a very different animal from LCDs. Colors pop, blacks are really black, contrast is astronomically higher, and AMOLEDs offer the potential for extending battery life by turning off pixels in dark mode. All of the above is why the world’s best smartphones now sport AMOLED displays.</p>
      <p>Dell claims an astronomical 100,000:1 contrast ratio. Dell also claims 100 percent coverage of the Adobe RGB color space. <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/review/370571/dell-xps-15-7590-oled">Testing has also shown</a> that the DCI-P3 color coverage is 97.6 percent and sRGB is 99 percent.</p>
      <p>And Dell’s display is 4K, Apple still isn’t quite there.</p>
      <p>The 16-inch MacBook Pro’s display has a wide DCI-P3-rated color gamut (97 percent), 100 percent of sRGB, and 91 percent Adobe RGB.</p>
      <p>It’s probably one of the best LCD displays out there and the hardware supports up to two 6K displays. But it isn’t OLED, which is why, no matter how good Apple’s LCD is, it won’t top the XPS 15.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Performance: close</b>
      </p>
      <p>The performance of the MacBook Pro’s AMD Pro 5500M graphics chip <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-Radeon-Pro-5500M-GPU-Benchmarks-and-Specs.442754.0.html">is up to 2x better</a> than the old Radeon RX 560X putting it in the same league as the Nvidia GTX 1650 mobile GPU (on the XPS 15).</p>
      <p>And the two machines are pretty evenly matched on CPUs.</p>
      <p>On Geekbench 4, the MBP 16 CPU test is showing Single-Core scores of around 5,400 and Multi-Core scores of roughly 28,000.</p>
      <p>Dell’s XPS 7590 Geekbench 4 CPU scores <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/13827272">are similar</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sound: Apple wins</b>
      </p>
      <p>No contest, Apple wins. The 16-inch MBP delivers room-filling sound with the most fulsome, undistorted bass I’ve ever heard in a laptop. If sound matters to you, it’s reason enough to buy the new MBP.</p>
      <p>The XPS 15 sound is good but, again, the MBP 16 is in another league.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Biometrics: Apple wins</b>
      </p>
      <p>I think all laptops should have both Face and fingerprint ID. However, since neither the MBP 16 nor the XPS 15 have Face ID, you have to rely on the fingerprint sensor. The MBP 16’s is almost flawless. It works almost every time. Dell’s isn’t as accurate and sometimes takes a few tries and sometimes forces you to enter a PIN to sign in because it fails to recognize your fingerprint.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Chassis / weight / design: Apple wins on weight, Dell on materials</b>
      </p>
      <p>Apple wins on weight. Despite boasting a bigger display and longer (front to back) chassis, it’s lighter at 4.3 pounds versus the XPS’ 4.5 pounds. The thickness of both laptops is pretty much the same.</p>
      <p>Design comes down to personal preference. The 16-inch MacBook Pro design is an improvement over the 15-inch because of the smaller bezels = better screen to body ratio.</p>
      <p>Dell’s design is getting long in the tooth but its carbon fiber palm rest falls into the “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” category.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Battery life: no winner</b>
      </p>
      <p>Based on anecdotal testing of my usage scenarios, they seem to be pretty close. Neither gets great battery life but if you dial back the screen brightness and avoid games and movies, you can squeeze out all-day battery life on both laptops. That said, more testing is required, particularly for the MBP 16, which I’ve been using for less than a week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Verdict:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dell wins on bang for buck. It costs less and you get an amazing OLED display to boot. The new 16-inch MBP is scary-good too and the best MacBook Apple has ever made.</p>
      <p>So, above, I tried to break it down on individual category wins (e.g., display, sound) as every user looks for features that are important to them. But, again, if you don’t want to pay the Apple tax but still want a great big-screen laptop, the XPS 15 may be the way to go.</p>
