      <h1>New BMW M3/M4 Will Look Radically Different</h1>
      <h2>M cars are all about exaggeration.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:55:34+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 00:55</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Rosenholtz</a></address>
      <p>As we eagerly await the arrival of the next-generation <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/m3">BMW M3 </a>sedan and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/m4">M4 </a>Coupe and Convertible, the details surrounding both cars have started to come into focus. We know power will come from a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged inline-six called the S58, which is currently found under the hood of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/x3-m">X3 M</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/x4-m">X4 M</a>. In the M3 and M4, it should produce around 450 to 500 horsepower going out to rear- or all-wheel-drive with the RWD models slated to receive less power while <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/great-news-sources-say-the-next-gen-bmw-m3-will-keep-the-manual">keeping a manual transmission option</a>.</p>
      <p>There have been <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/bmw-s-new-m3-design-is-slowly-coming-into-focus">plenty of spy shots</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/leaked-check-out-the-rear-of-new-bmw-m3">leaked images</a> of the next-generation M3 and M4 but speaking with BMW M CEO Markus Flasch at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show, <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/22/m-boss-confirms-2021-bmw-m3-m4-will-differentiate-very-much-from-base-models/">BMW Blog</a> was able to get some more details about what we can expect from these two cars.</p>

      <p>When asked if the leaked images will be close to the production version, Flasch said the "M3/M4 are the legend. As you mentioned also, the cars will differentiate very much from the base models. We have gone to a greater extent than we have done in the past. The cars look phenomenal."</p>
      <p>It is likely that the G82 M4 will sport <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/bmw-says-new-epic-grille-on-4-series-wont-date-quickly">a larger kidney grille</a>, similar to the one used on the Concept 4. In our recent interview with BMW, we were told the new grille is meant to provide "a glimpse into the future" and have a lower risk of becoming dated quickly.</p>

      <p>Not only will these cars likely have larger grilles than their non-M counterparts, the G80 M3 and G82 M4 should have different grilles than each other. The M3 might have its own design interpretation of the kidney grille that looks totally different than the M4.</p>
      <p>"The M version is always about exaggeration. It's the best version of each product. Actually, the designers are always designing to the end, meaning to the top product. Then the sketches get toned down for the standard production series cars", BMW design boss Domagoj Dukec told BMW Blog in a previous interview. "This is something we started three years ago and it will be very special, but you have to wait a bit longer."</p>
