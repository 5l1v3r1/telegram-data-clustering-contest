      <p>On Sunday morning, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut put up a tweet to comment on the potboiler that is Maharashtra politics.</p>
      <p>On a single tweet, the Sena leader wrote, “Accidental Shapath grahan (swearing-in).”</p>
      <p>For those who don’t remember, Saturday was a day of shocks and surprises in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Early on Saturday morning, BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as the chief minister with NCP’s Ajit Pawar.</p>
      <p>This set the ball rolling with NCP chief Sharad Pawar stating that the decision to side with the BJP was his nephew’s alone and not his.</p>
      <p>The Pawar-led party also had a meet in the evening in which they decided to remove Ajit Pawar as the legislature party leader and also moved all their MLAs to a hotel in Mumbai’s Powai area.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the Sena, NCP and Congress also moved the Supreme Court seeking quashing of the Maharashtra governor’s decision to swear-in BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister and demanded an immediate floor test to avoid “further horse trading”.</p>
      <p>A bench of justices N V Ramana, Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna will hear the plea on Sunday at 11:30 am.</p>
