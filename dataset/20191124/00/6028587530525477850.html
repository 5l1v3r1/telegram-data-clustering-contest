      <p>We haven’t quite got to the year-end, but according to figures published by financial data provider, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/">Pitchbook</a>, investment in U.K. tech entrepreneurs by U.S. venture capitalists has already risen to record levels. But although that’s undoubtedly good news for early-stage businesses, there may be a sting in the tail for the British economy.   Released to coincide with Silicon Valley Comes to the UK - an annual event that brings together entrepreneurs and financiers from both sides of the Atlantic - the figures indicated that stateside investors have been involved in deals valued at $4.4 billion so far this year, with London businesses accounting for 77 percent of the total. Deals completed so far include a $144 million Series F investment in digital bank Monzo led by Y Combinator and a $70 million investment by Accel in cybersecurity company Snyk.</p>
      <p>Sherry Coutu CBE is an angel investor who co-founded <a href="https://www.svc2uk.com/">Silicon Valley Comes to the UK</a> (SVC2UK to its friends) in 2006 with entrepreneurs Reid Hoffman and Ellen Levy. The intention back then was to encourage business formation in the U.K. by bringing over U.S. serial entrepreneurs to talk about their experience of successfully scaling up their companies  Or to put it another way, it was about exposing the U.K. to the dynamism of the Silicon Valley ecosystem. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Attractive Science</b>
      </p>
      <p>And SVC2UK provides a perspective on why North American investors are on the lookout for British investments. As Coutu explains, the event  - or more accurately a series of events -attracts significant numbers of U.S. venture capitalists. “They are attracted by the quality of the science that they see in the U.K.,” she says. “Silicon Valley Comes to the UK provides them with an efficient way to meet the founders of British tech companies.” </p>
      <p><b>More Ambition</b> </p>
      <p>David Hornik - a general partner at U.S. VC August Capital - has been a regular SVC2UK attendee - and as he sees it, increased investment in British tech us being driven,at least in part,by evidence that businesses born in London and other hubs across the country have grown in their ambition. “I’ve been coming here for a lot of years and I’ve witnessed a lot of changes in the U.K. ecosystem,” he says. “Historically, the difference between the two ecosystems has been that companies forming in the Bay Area set out from the start to make a dent on the planet. British companies have been more locally focused.” But that, he says, has changed. U.K. tech startups have become more ambitious in terms of global expansion and that has made them more attractive to overseas investors. </p>
      <p>And according to Sherry Coutu, U.S. investors are filling a gap in the funding market. “There is often local Series  A and Series B funding for companies that are scaling up,” he says. “But U.S. investors are coming in with Series C, D, E, and F.”  </p>
      <p>
        <b>The Brexit Elephant</b>
      </p>
      <p>There is, if course, currently an elephant in the room in the form of Brexit. Now the thing about the UK’s departure from the European Union is that it still more or less impossible to predict how the story will end. Depending on the outcome of the British general election, a formal cutting of the ties may happen at the end of January, with or without a withdrawal agreement. After that, we face the prospect of protracted negotiations on a future trade deal. The uncertainty is set to continue.  </p>
      <p>Coutu and Hornik are agreed that the ongoing confusion is not affecting the appetite of U.S investors for British startups. In fact, Coutu argues that they may be filling in the funding gaps left by British and European investors who have been spooked by the whole Brexit Saga. </p>
      <p>“That’s good in the short term,” she says. “But in the longer term, it might not be good for U.K, Plc.” Her logic is that if U.S. investment dominates, scaleup companies may focus on growing their business on the other side of the Atlantic. Job creation and tax payment will migrate across the Atlantic accordingly. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Talent Shortages</b>
      </p>
      <p>She is also concerned about talent shortages. Under current government plans, when Britain leaves the E.U. freedom of movement will end, to be replaced by a points-based system. In the meantime, a visa scheme for highly skilled tech workers - organized by Tech Nation - has been extended. Coutu thinks this isn’t enough. “In my view, there should be scope to issue many more thousands of visas,” she says. </p>
      <p>But if those are the storm clouds, the mood around this year’s SVC2UK - staged in partnership with<a href="https://www.londonandpartners.com/"> London and Partners</a> - remains positive. More U.S. investment but also a much healthier British entrepreneurial scene. </p>
      <p>Coutu cites the example of a SVC2UK event staged over two nights, exclusively for serial entrepreneurs. “We good 200 people in the room two nights on the trot,” she says,  Finding that number of serial entrepreneurs 13 years ago would have been a struggle.</p>
