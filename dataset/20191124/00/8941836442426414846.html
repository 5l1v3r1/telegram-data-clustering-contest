      <p>REYNOLDSBURG, Ohio (AP) - Some Ohio farmers say the state’s proposed rules for hemp production may create a barrier that excludes smaller growers.</p>
      <p>The Ohio Department of Agriculture’s proposed rules for the newly legalized crop require at least 1,000 plants be grown on at least a quarter acre (0.10 hectare) of land.</p>
      <p>Some farmers say the planting minimum and $500 license application fee creates a high entry barrier for an industry that doesn’t have a market yet in Ohio and already presents risks for growers.</p>
      <p>Ohio legalized hemp production this year.</p>
      <p>The Columbus Dispatch reports the state says plant minimums ease the burden on police in distinguishing backyard plots of hemp from illegal marijuana.</p>

      <p>Officials say licensing fees help cover costs of federal inspection requirements.</p>
      <p>The rules are expected to be finalized in January.</p>
