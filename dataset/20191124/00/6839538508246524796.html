      <p>Police are on the hunt for a group of at least three teenagers who trashed a short-stay accommodation in Cannington, inflicting more than $60,000 worth of damage on the accommodation.</p>
      <p>The owner of the home on Short Street has been left in despair after furniture was thrown through windows, doors were pulled off their hinges and electrical goods were strewn across the front lawn at an out-of-control party.</p>
      <p>Police were called to the rental about 11.30pm on Saturday night after reports of a disturbance at the short stay accommodation.</p>

      <p>At the time, neighbours reported hearing glass smashing following a house party.</p>
      <p>WA Police said there were at least 30 people at the home, which was rented out for four days, when officers arrived.</p>
      <p>The destruction of property was widespread, with every window in the four bedroom home smashed, broken doors and white goods and furniture strewn across the front yard.</p>
      <p>Some furniture was also left embedded in the walls of the $140-a-night rental home.</p>

      <p>Premier Mark McGowan said while he did not “know anything about the party”, he hoped whoever was behind the destruction would pay back the owner of the property.</p>
      <p>The incident is a timely matter, given the ongoing inquiry in the potential regulation of short-stay accommodation in WA.</p>
      <p>“I certainly support the inquiry and working out what sort of regulatory measures can be put in place,” Mr McGowan said.</p>
      <p>“We are currently awaiting a report from the Department of Consumer Protection on what measures should and could be put in place. (But) it is a difficult issue because obviously a lot of people like to stay in Airbnbs ... On the other hand you have existing operators who run hotels, you have people who might be living next door to one and they might not be too happy about it.</p>
      <p>“So coming up with a balance in all of this is not easy. I know different sides of the debate want everything to go their own way. I think there is probably a good middle course involved in this.”</p>
      <p>Detective Superintendent in Charge of the Major Crime Division, Robert Anderson, said he felt “very sorry” for the owners of the Cannington rental.</p>
      <p>“There's a risk with (short-stay accommodation). You rent your house out, it is a risk,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It's a rare risk that the eventuality happens like this but again I feel very sorry for the owners of that house and WA Police Force will again put our full resources into that.</p>
      <p>“The local district will be managing that and I'm sure they're taking that investigation very seriously, so hopefully we will identify those offenders and bring them to justice.”</p>
      <p>Police are asking for help from members of the public in identifying the suspects involved, urging anyone with information to call 131 444 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://wapf.au.evidence.com/axon/citizen/public/airbnb-damage-cannington">public portal</a> has also been created for anyone who has CCTV, dash-cam footage or video footage.</p>
