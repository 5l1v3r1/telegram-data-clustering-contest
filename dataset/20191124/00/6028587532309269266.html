      <p><b>Walt Disney’s <i>Frozen II, </i>starring Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff and Josh Gad, opened with a strong $127 million domestic and record-breaking $350 million worldwide launch. </b>Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck<i>’s Frozen II </i>showed itself while ending a post-summer box office “slump,” one mostly caused by <i>Wonder Woman 1984 </i>and <i>No Time to Die </i>moving into 2020. It nabbed a strong $127 million domestic and $350.2 million worldwide launch. That’s a record global opening for a toon, eclipsing <i>Incredibles 2</i>’s $242 million worldwide launch, including a record (for Disney Animation) $55 million opening in China. It means <i>Frozen II </i>may match/exceed the first <i>Frozen</i>’s $876 million overseas cume. Its opening day was “fine, I guess” in relation to previous big animated titles and previous big YA fantasy flicks that opened on this pre-Thanksgiving frame. It stepped into the power on Saturday and Sunday.  </p>
      <p>It earned $41.8 million on Friday but $49.8 million on Saturday, a 19% jump from its opening day and a 50% jump if you remove the $8.5 million-worth of Thursday previews. Animated films generally expand on Saturday and Sunday thanks to kid-powered matinees, but the likes of <i>Finding Dory </i>($135 million from a $56 million Friday) and <i>Minions </i>($115 million from a $46 million Friday) meant that we couldn’t be certain that <i>Frozen 2 </i>wouldn’t play like a general all-audiences blockbuster. A 3.04x weekend multiplier isn’t the world’s biggest multiplier for a toon, but it was big enough to (for now) overcome any concerns I had about the Friday figure while snagging the third-biggest toon opening ever.</p>

      <p><i>Frozen II</i>’s opening weekend was over/under, sans inflation, the third-biggest animated launch of all time in North America, behind the $135 million Fri-Sun bow of <i>Finding Dory </i>and the record-crushing $183 million open for <i>Incredibles 2</i>. Yes, for this discussion, <i>The Lion King </i>($191 million) is technically “live action,” but I digress. In terms of YA franchise sequels, it right above <i>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part I </i>($122 million) and <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I </i>($125 million), and right below the <i>Twilight </i>sequels ($142 million, $138 million and $141 million) and <i>Hunger Games: Catching Fire </i>($158 million). It’s the fifth-biggest November launch ever and the first non-summer toon to open above $100 million.</p>
      <p>If you want reasons why <i>Frozen 2 </i>only made “most of the money” this weekend, at least domestically, as opposed to “all the money,” blame merely decent reviews, a lack of new marquee characters, a (all due respect and no spoilers) lack of buzzy plot turns and the mere fact that a lot fewer people go to the movies just to go to the movies than they did in 2013. For that matter, six years is a long time, and it’s possible that some of the audience that grew up worshiping Anna and Elsa when they were younger moved on to other pop culture interests. Still, a $127 million Fri-Sun opening is bigger than any previous Thanksgiving five-day launch.</p>

      <p>Its overall domestic fate will be determined by if it plays like a seasonal toon or a fan-driven fantasy blockbuster. A 2.8x multiplier, think <i>Minions </i>($336 million from a $115 million opening)<i>, The Lorax </i>($213 million/$71 million), the <i>Hunger Games </i>sequels ($424 million/$158 million, $337 million/$122 million and $282 million/$102 million), the early <i>Harry Potter </i>sequels ($264 million/$88 million and $292 million/$102 million) and <i>Twilight </i>($191 million/$69 million), gets it to $355 million. A 3.12x multiplier (<i>Fantastic Beasts 1</i>) would be $396 million. A run like <i>Harry Potter 1 </i>(3.5x) or <i>Wreck-It Ralph </i>(3.8x), while unlikely, gets it between $444 million and $483 million. No, I don’t think those <i>Twilight </i>sequels (2x their $138-$142 million openings) apply here.</p>
      <p>For that matter, even a run like <i>Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald </i>($159 million/$62 million) and <i>Justice League </i>($229 million/$93 million) would give it a $312-$325 million domestic total. To be fair, both <i>Toy Story 3 </i>and <i>Toy Story 4 </i>legged past $400 million (during the summer) from $110-$120 million launches. <i>Frozen </i>lucked out in 2013/2014, opening right after an early November flop (<i>Ender’s Game</i>), a lesser MCU movie (<i>Thor: The Dark World</i>) and a fan-driven (and rather violent) <i>Hunger Games </i>sequel. That Christmas, it faced only the ultra violent <i>Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug </i>and adult-skewing movies like <i>American Hustle, Wolf of Wall Street</i>, <i>Saving Mr. Banks </i>and <i>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</i>.</p>

      <p><i>Frozen </i>was “it” for kid flicks until <i>The LEGO Movie </i>in February of 2014. <i>Frozen 2</i> won’t have such luxuries. Starting December 13, admittedly 21 days into its run, it’ll face <i>Jumanji: The Next Level</i>, <i>Black Christmas</i>, <i>Cats, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Spies in Disguise </i>and <i>Little Women</i>. Of course, the movie has earned $350.2 million worldwide, including a record (for Disney Animation) $53 million in China, so domestic figures may eventually be trivia. Even if it doesn’t match the ridiculous $247 million that <i>Frozen </i>earned in Japan (it opened $18.2 million in Japan), the boost in China could make up the difference and then some.</p>
      <p>Come what may, after all the huff-and-puff, <i>Frozen II </i>could be the most conventional kind of sequel of all. <i>Frozen II</i>, artistic intent notwithstanding, exists entirely because the first one made a lot of money and exists mostly to protect the brand. It could just be another sequel that earns less in North America than its predecessor while earning more overseas. That said, after many an IP cash-ins and/or unrequested sequels (<i>Men in Black</i>, <i>Charlie’s Angels</i>, <i>Rambo: Last Blood</i>, <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i>, <i>Child’s Play</i>, etc.) that stumbled due to audience indifference, it’s nice to see a sequel break big because audiences, here’s a novel idea, really liked the previous movie and expressed a desire to see another one.</p>
