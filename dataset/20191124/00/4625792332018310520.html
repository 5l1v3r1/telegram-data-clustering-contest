      <p>Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was admitted to the hospital on Friday after experiencing chills and a fever.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg, 86, was "admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, last night after experiencing chills and fever earlier in the day," the Supreme Court said in a statement Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>"She was initially evaluated at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C. before being transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital for further evaluation and treatment of any possible infection. With intravenous antibiotics and fluids, her symptoms have abated and she expects to be released from the hospital as early as Sunday morning. Further updates will be made when available," it continued.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Ginsburg <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ruth-bader-ginsburg-returns-to-supreme-court-after-brief-illness">missed</a> oral arguments because of the stomach flu, but she was back to work within a day. Chief Justice John Roberts said Ginsburg intended to participate in considering the cases heard on the day she was absent, as she was able to read the briefs and transcripts.</p>
      <p>This was the first time Ginsburg missed oral arguments since her recovery from a surgery that removed two cancerous nodes from her left lung last year. She also successfully completed radiation treatment for pancreatic cancer in August.</p>
      <p>Named to the Supreme Court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, Ginsburg has vowed to remain on until she is at least 90.</p>
