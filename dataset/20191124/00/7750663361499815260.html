      <h1>Andy Gray tips Tottenham Hotspur to reach Champions League final</h1>
      <h2>Former Scotland striker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andy-gray/"><b>Andy Gray</b></a> has insisted that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> can make a second successive <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/"><b>Champions League</b></a> final under the leadership of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a>.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a> led Spurs to the 2019 Champions League final before losing his position as head coach last week, with Mourinho quickly announced as the Argentine's replacement.</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea and Manchester United manager made a winning start to his tenure on Saturday as Tottenham recorded a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/result/result-mourinho-begins-spurs-reign-with-deserved-win_380335.html">3-2 victory</a> at West Ham United in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Despite the team's struggles in the opening months of the 2019-20 campaign, Gray has tipped Mourinho to lead the capital side to another Champions League final.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to make a statement here, I wouldn't be surprised if he [Mourinho] takes them back to the Champions League final this year. I am telling you," Gray told <i>beIN Sports</i>.</p>
      <p>"If they beat Olympiacos in midweek then they can forget it till February. When February comes around he'll have been there for a while and this is pretty much the team that got to the final last year. With Mourinho, stranger things have happened. We can revisit this in six months."</p>
      <p>Spurs are currently second in their <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/champions-league/2019-20/group-b.html">Champions League group</a> with seven points to show from their four matches ahead of next week's clash with Olympiacos.</p>
