      <h1>27 top black executives were asked to be Eskom CEO – They all said no</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>While the government has been criticised for selecting a white executive as Eskom CEO, a <a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/news/2019-11-24-27-top-black-execs-did-not-want-eskom-ceo-job/"><b>new report</b></a> from the Sunday Times states that 27 black executives were offered the position first.</p>
      <p>They all declined.</p>
      <p>The report stated that Eskom created a list of the executives it would like for the role of CEO and hired a recruitment agency to contact them.</p>
      <p>“All of them said no. A lot of black executives don’t want anything to do with state-owned entities,” a government source told the newspaper.</p>
      <p>This was due to the expected political interference and the fact that state-owned enterprises have “ruined a lot of careers and expectations”.</p>
      <p>This list reportedly included Eskom board members Nelisiwe Magubane and Sifiso Dabengwa.</p>
      <h3>White CEO</h3>
      <p>Following the lack of interest from these executives, <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/energy/328153-eskom-appoints-new-ceo.html"><b>it was announced</b></a> that Nampak CEO Andre de Ruyter would take the position at the head of Eskom.</p>
      <p>The National Union of Mineworkers and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/energy/328443-white-eskom-ceo-angers-labour-unions.html"><b>immediately criticised</b> </a>De Ruyter’s appointment as a setback to the country’s racial-transformation agenda.</p>
      <p>The EFF added to this, stating it was racist and a deliberate attempt to diminish the role Africans play in the economy.</p>
      <p>De Ruyter, however, is reported to have performed well in Eskom interviews and the assessment process.</p>
      <p>Additionally, he prepared a presentation on an unbundling process for Eskom and how to restructure its debt, stated the report.</p>
      <h3>Eskom problems</h3>
      <p>Eskom is <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/energy/325617-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-eskom.html"><b>in a bad way</b></a> as a company, following years of corruption and mismanagement at the state-owned enterprise.</p>
      <p>The company has over R450 billion in debt and is struggling with low productivity, poor flexibility, no competition, and corruption which is milking the company’s coffers dry.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnbcafrica.com/videos/2018/12/07/ted-blom-urges-radical-restructuring-to-save-eskom/"><b>Energy expert Ted Blom said</b></a> the following needs to take place to fix Eskom:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Significantly reduce the workforce.</li>
        <li>Aggressively address mismanagement and corruption.</li>
        <li>Ensure Eskom pays the lowest possible price for coal, equipment, and services.</li>
        <li>Remove all regulatory restraints which stop small scale power generation plants from feeding into the grid.</li>
        <li>Privatise parts of Eskom.</li>
        <li>Invest significantly in renewable energy.</li>
      </ul>
