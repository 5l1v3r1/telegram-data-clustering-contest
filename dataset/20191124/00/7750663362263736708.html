      <p>Watford slipped to a dispiriting 3-0 home loss to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/burnley/"><b>Burnley</b></a>, who had <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chris-wood/"><b>Chris Wood</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ashley-barnes/"><b>Ashley Barnes</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-tarkowski/"><b>James Tarkowski</b></a> on target.</p>
      <p>The Hornets suffered a club-record 11th consecutive home league match without victory, failing to capitalise on a promising first-half and capitulating after the interval.</p>
      <blockquote>I'm not worried about anything in my life. We just need time, we need belief, we need fight<cite>Quique Sanchez Flores</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Flores has garnered just seven points from nine games at the Hornets helm after replacing <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/javi-gracia/"><b>Javi Gracia</b></a> in September, but remains calm about his chances of turning a dismal start on its head.</p>
      <p>"We just need time, we need belief, we need fight; all these kind of things," said Flores.</p>
      <p>"We can do it together, but it doesn't depend on me, it's not my control. I'm not worried about anything in my life.</p>
      <p>"It is very difficult to explain the result as I don't want it to sound like excuses. But we had the better chances.</p>
      <p>"Things changed that affected our mentality and spirit.</p>

      <p>"After winning at Norwich we did not think everything was resolved and fixed. But after defeat we don't think everything is lost.</p>
      <p>"We need to keep positive. Football is very unpredictable, it is impossible to say how everything is.</p>
      <p>"It's about how you trust or not trust in your players.</p>
      <p>"About me, I don't have any doubt in my players or the squad, I believe in them 100 per cent they can change in the situation. But I know it is very difficult."</p>
      <p>Watford dominated the first half but failed to find a breakthrough, and paid the price after the turnaround as Burnley bruised their way to a victory to push them up to sixth in the table.</p>

      <p>Wood hooked home well after a corner, while Barnes converted a penalty awarded after a VAR check.</p>
      <p>Centre back James Tarkowski capped a mixed and often error-strewn afternoon by firing home the third goal to steal a last laugh that had Burnley's fans taunting their Watford counterparts.</p>
      <p>A delighted Burney boss Sean Dyche insisted his Clarets will not let their lofty league position of sixth go to their heads, despite their fine start to the campaign.</p>
      <p>"We've been up in that territory a couple of years ago, but last year was a real reminder of how tough the Premier League is," said Dyche.</p>
      <p>"We won't get carried away but it is there to be enjoyed, of course it is.</p>
      <p>"Since the turnaround at the turn of the year into 2019, our goalscoring record has been really pleasing.</p>
      <p>"Today's chances weren't quality but we took them. We've got to keep looking to try to do that.</p>
      <p>"It all comes down to the details in order to take as many chances we can. It's really difficult to create them let alone take them in the Premier League."</p>
