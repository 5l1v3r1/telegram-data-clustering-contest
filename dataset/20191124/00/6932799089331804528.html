        <b>If you were asked what smartphone delivers the best audio experience, you'd probably go with the iPhone 11 Pro Max, Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, or, perhaps, the LG V50. Well, DxOMark has other ideas, and consider the Huawei Mate 20 X the true king of smartphone audio.</b>

      <p>DxOMark is known for its photography reviews, as the website is just about the only platform delivering a standardized evaluation scheme for smartphone cameras—regardless of how accurate the final rankings are. The website has now added a new review section portfolio, as it's now offering audio reviews of phones.</p>
      <p>Going by DxOMark, the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Huawei-Mate-20-X-Smartphone-Review.393021.0.html">Huawei Mate 20 X</a> has the best audio of any smartphone in the market. The phone earned a total score of 75, making it the current champ in that department, just half a step ahead of the iPhone XS Max at 74.</p>
      <p>The audio reviews are split into two: playback and recording. The Mate 20 X earned a playback score of 76, and a recording score of 70. The iPhone XS Max is slightly worse at both, with a 75 playback score, and  69 recording score. Nice. The <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-Smartphone-Review-Optimised-SoC-promises-better-runtimes.433424.0.html">Galaxy Note 10+</a> has an overall score of 66, with a playback score of 68 and a recording score of 61.</p>
      <p>Rather interestingly, the last-gen <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-Smartphone-Review.333544.0.html">iPhone XS Max</a> is ranked higher than Apple's current-gen premium phone, the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-Smartphone-Review-A-leap-forwards-or-more-of-the-same.435028.0.html">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a>. The iPhone 11 Pro Max has an overall score of 71, with a playback subscore of 72, and a recording score of 68.</p>
      <p>We're interested in seeing how LG's phones perform in this test, as they're generally regarded as being the current audio champs, at least in the recording department. They aren't shabby at playback either, with LG's Boombox tech making for some really loud audio performance.</p>
