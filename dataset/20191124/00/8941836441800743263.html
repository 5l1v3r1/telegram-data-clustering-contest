      <p>TROY, Ala. (AP) - Alabama researchers are studying new ways to recycle plastics.</p>
      <p>Troy University says its recently established Center for Material and Manufacturing Sciences has received a $2.7 million grant to look at new methods of recycling plastic waste.</p>
      <p>A statement from the school says the money will pay for scientists and students to work on the project, plus equipment to do the work.</p>
      <p>The grant is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is part of the U.S. Commerce Department. It provided another grant of $3.2 million last year.</p>
