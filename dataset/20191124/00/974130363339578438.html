      <h1>Report: Borussia Dortmund Become Latest Club To Show Interest in Troy Parrott</h1>

      <p>After signing Jadon Sancho and converting him into one of the most sought-after wingers in Europe, Borussia Dortmund have reportedly identified another 17-year-old they hope could have a similar effect - Troy Parrott.</p>
      <p>There have been multiple reports in recent weeks claiming Juventus, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich have all expressed an interest in the Irish teenager; now, according to the Mirror, Lucien Favre's outfit appear to have set their eyes on the Irish international.</p>
      <p>The Dubliner's future is somewhat uncertain in London since Jose Mourinho, who was appointed manager of Tottenham Hotspur last week, doesn't exactly boast an inspiring record of utilising academy players of Parrott's ilk.</p>

      <p>The forward played on only one occasion under Mauricio Pochettino - in a Carabao Cup encounter against Colchester United - though he was named in a Premier League squad for the first time earlier this month when the club faced Everton. He wasn't named in yesterday's squad, Mourinho's first game in charge, as the side overcame West Ham 3-2 at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>While Bayern Munich may seem like a more attractive prospect for the Tottenham youngster, there is a degree of instability at the Allianz Arena after their manager Niko Kovac was sacked three weeks ago. Moreover, Robert Lewandowski is in sparkling form, having scored 24 goals already this season.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he may find more opportunities at Signal Iduna Park where Paco Alcacer is their sole out-and-out striker of significance. In contrast to Lewandowski, he has only scored seven goals this season for Dortmund.</p>
