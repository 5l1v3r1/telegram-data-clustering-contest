      <p>CAIRO, Nov 24 (MENA) - The Ministry of Environment will convene on Monday a conference on the occasion of the end of air pollution waves for 2019 or the so-called "black clouds". <br/><br/>Minister of Environment Yassmin Fouad, Minister of Agriculture EzzEldin Abu Steit, Minister of Local Development Mahmoud Shaarawi and a number of government officials will take part in the conference. <br/><br/>Last week, the Ministry of Environment honored a number of employees who have been involved in confronting the wave of air pollutants or the so-called "black clouds" over the past period in appreciation of their efforts in the management of the national anti-air pollution mechanism and their success in overcoming various environmental challenges during their work. <br/><br/>Over the past years, Egypt has faced a phenomenon called "black clouds" following the season of harvesting rice, in the summer months. The black cloud is a result of burning huge amounts of rice straw in the cultivated land in the Nile Delta. <br/><br/>The Ministry of Environment has outlined a plan that included mutual procedures with other concerned institutions and ministries that continued over a whole year to counter all forms of pollution in this regard.</p>
