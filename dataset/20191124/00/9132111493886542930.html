      <p>The Member of Parliament for Ajumako Enyan Essiam Constituency, Cassiel Ato Forson has urged the Ajumako Police to stop sleeping on the job and ensure the District is safe.</p>
      <p>According to him, the increasing spate of crime in the area is a huge cause for concern and it is important that the security agency ups its game to protect law-abiding residents to go about their business in safety.</p>
      <p>The MP, who is also the Minority Spokesperson on Finance made the comments when he paid a visit to the family of the commercial driver who was shot and killed by armed robbers at Ekumfi Ekrowful Friday dawn.</p>
      <p>“What I want to say is the Police and the government to improve the level of security in this area. It appears the crime rate in the area is getting out of hand, it isn’t now that the police is getting to know that there are armed robbers on that stretch of road. Why is it that they know of such crimes being committed in that area but have looked on for such a thing to happen. Not too long ago, armed robbers snatched someone’s car, others have also been attacked. We cannot continue to look on for such things to happen,” Hon. Ato Forson said.</p>
      <p>He added that he’ll consult the Police and the government to look at the possibility of erecting a barrier on the road to improve safety.</p>
      <p>Kasapa FM News' Yaw Boagyan reported the deceased driver was heading to Accra from Ajumako when he spotted some armed robbers attacking vehicles ahead of him.</p>
      <p>He then decided to turn back to avoid being attacked by the robbers.</p>
      <p>It was while he tried turning the vehicle that the robbers started firing at him. Unfortunately, he was hit by some bullets in the neck killing him instantly.</p>
      <p>Police have launched a manhunt for the robbers.</p>
