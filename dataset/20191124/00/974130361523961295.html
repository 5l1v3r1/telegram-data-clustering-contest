      <h1>Watch: Deontay Wilder Sets Up Tyson Fury Rematch With Another Knockout Shot</h1>

      <p>The rematch everybody wants is on. Deontay Wilder set up a highly-anticipated rematch with Tyson Fury last night in Las Vegas after dropping Luis Ortiz in the seventh round of their heavyweight contest.</p>
      <p>The rematch has now been pencilled for February, last night's fight being Wilder's last appearance before returning to the ring for his second bout with the Gypsy King.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Sky Sports after the bout, the American confirmed Fury was the next man on his radar, though he also revealed he had his eyes on the winner of the other major heavyweight fight in the world of boxing happening early next month.</p>
      <blockquote>Tyson Fury is definitely next and after that I want a unification bout with whoever the winner is [between Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr]. Right now, we're ready for Tyson Fury. Hopefully he's ready for me.</blockquote>
      <p>The Bronze Bomber delivered on his reputation as the hardest hitter in boxing at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, stretching his unbeaten record to 42 fights, all but two of those being stopped early. Fury, however, famously recovered from one of Wilder's devastating punches last December in a fight that resulted in a split-decision.</p>

      <p>Next February's bout is expected to be the biggest heavyweight bout in recent memory given the clash of styles on show. While Wilder's power is peerless among the current stable of heavyweight fighters, so, too, is Fury's boxing intellect. All in all, both men are expected to earn more from next spring's fights than any of their previous bouts.</p>
