      <p><i>When man tried to stop group of 5 from fighting on the road, they assaulted him</i> <br/><br/>A 30-year-old man was thrashed by a group of five men, who were busy fighting in the middle of the road near Varthur, for asking them to make way for his vehicle to move ahead. <br/><br/>The incident took place on Thurubarahalli Siddapura Road on Tuesday night in Varthur police station limits. <br/><br/>The victim, Manjunatha B, a resident of Whitefield and a farmer, has filed a complaint with the Varthur police. <br/><br/>Manjunatha said that on Tuesday around 8:30 pm, he was travelling from Marathahalli towards Ramagondanahalli on his bike when he noticed that a group of men were fighting in the middle of the road on Thurubarahalli Siddapura Road near Nandi glass plywood shop. <br/><br/>He said, “Three men had parked their bikes in the middle of the road and were fighting. I asked them not to fight in the middle of the road as it was affecting the traffic and they started fighting with me.” <br/><br/>The men abused him and also tried to hit him, he said. “When I resisted and questioned them for attacking me, they got more aggressive. Two other men standing next to a scooter nearby, joined them and started assaulting me. They attacked me with their fists on my head and chest. They picked up a stone and hit my helmet. I fell and they started kicking me. One of them kicked me on my stomach and snatched my Oneplus 6 phone and threw it on the road.” <br/><br/>Manjunatha said, they told him nobody could do anything to them and even threatened to kill him. “I had sustained severe injuries on my face and my nose was bleeding. My teeth was hurting too and I was scared that they would beat me up more and I managed to flee from the spot,” he stated in his complaint. <br/><br/>Varthur police have registered a case and IPC section 341 (wrongful restraint), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 427 (Mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees or more), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace). The police are now on the lookout for the accused.</p>
