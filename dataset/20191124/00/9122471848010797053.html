      <p>Ohio State’s football program is having a pretty nice little Saturday. The Buckeyes got a big home win against Penn State this afternoon. Less than an hour after the win, Ryan Day’s program got some major recruiting news.</p>
      <p>Miyan Williams, a running back in the 2020 class, has flipped his commitment from Iowa State to Ohio State.</p>
      <p>The Cincinnati native is a rising recruit in the ’20 class. He fills a need at the running back position for Ohio State’s 2020 class.</p>
      <p>Williams announced the decision on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Williams is a 5-foot-10, 210-pound running back with a bruising style of play. Some <a href="https://www.elevenwarriors.com/ohio-state-football-recruiting/2019/10/107862/three-star-2020-rb-miyan-williams-flips-from-iowa-state-to-ohio-state">have compared his style of play to that of Carlos Hyde</a>, who starred for the Buckeyes.</p>
      <p>Ohio State’s 2020 class ranks No. 4 in the country and No. 1 in the Big Ten, <a href="https://247sports.com/college/ohio-state/Season/2020-Football/Commits/">per 247Sports</a>.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes now have 25 commitments in the class.</p>
