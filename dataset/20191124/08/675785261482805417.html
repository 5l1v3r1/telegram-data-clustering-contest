      <h1>Jose Mourinho could be exactly what Tottenham need - despite what the doubters say</h1>
      <h2>Yes he can be pig-headed and childish, but the Portuguese is a box-office boss who is more than capable of doing the exact short-term job that Tottenham need right now</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:49:01+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:49</time> by <a rel="author">Robbie Fowler, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/robbie-fowler/</a></address>
      <p>I’ve seen so much said about Jose Mourinho being the wrong man for the Spurs job – but nobody has ­considered why it may just be exactly the right fit.</p>
      <p>I’m a big fan of his, always have been. I know he rubs ­people up the wrong way, I know there can be an arrogance about him – needed in this job, by the way – that sometimes goes over into something ­unpleasant.</p>
      <p>Yet he’s a damn fine manager. Full stop. His record shows that.</p>
      <p>He’s been condemned for his previous three managerial roles in how they ended, but look at what he won at all three clubs.</p>
      <p>La Liga and cups in Madrid, an almost miraculous third title with Chelsea and two cups at Old Trafford… which, believe me, was some feat given the state of the club at the time. The bottom line is, I believe Mourinho is good for the Premier League. It is a better place with him in it.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>He’s so divisive in splitting opinions, but he’s a character, a real focal point in a sport which needs those things.</p>
      <p>Pig-headed, yep, sometimes childish. All of those things, but, again, that’s part of the whole package – he’s a top manager with a lot of eccentricities that make him box-office.</p>
      <p>And he’s what Spurs need right now. Let’s face it, they didn’t sack Mauricio Pochettino because they thought he was a bad manager, or even because they felt he couldn’t rebuild his team and come again.</p>

        <figcaption>The Portuguese could be the perfect man to do a short-term job (Image: Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>They sacked him because they don’t have time to rebuild again. They have just made an eye-watering investment in a stadium that costs a ­staggering amount in interest every year… and they need to pay it.</p>
      <p>So they need to be in the top four, need to be in the ­Champions League and need someone to get them there sharpish – because time is ­running out.</p>
      <p>I reckon the board at Spurs looked at Leicester and thought, ‘Oh no’. If they take the third Champions League spot, as I think they may, then that leaves only one more place.</p>

      <p>Mourinho is many things, but he’s an ­organiser who can come in, assess the personnel and come up with a system that works.</p>
      <p>He can also get ­players doing the job he wants, whether they are desperate to leave or longing for a new contract. ­Tottenham’s success was based on a ­defensive excellence that has disappeared ­without a trace in 2019. And guess what, Mourinho is the ­master of organising a defence.</p>

      <p>I reckon he’ll be straight in to ­Jan ­Vertonghen, Toby Alderweireld and Danny Rose ­saying, "It doesn’t ­matter where you want to be or what gripe you had with the club and the previous ­manager, I’ll fight for you, if you fight for me."</p>
      <p>He’ll get them doing what they’re good at again. He’ll get them ­organised, ­giving them a platform for a still incredible forward line to fire once again.</p>
      <p>And, judging by yesterday’s victory over West Ham, he already has Dele Alli back to his level again. All that adds up to a team who could still be in contention for a top-four place.</p>
      <p>If they do that, Spurs will avert a ­potential ­financial black hole which could set them back years.</p>

      <p>And if that happens, then it will be the right decision to ­appoint Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Yes, it’s a risk, and yes he probably won’t last three years – but maybe that’s what they want.</p>
      <p>Someone to come in, sort them out, and set ­a ­platform for the next ­Pochettino to build on.</p>
