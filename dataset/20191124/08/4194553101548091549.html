      <h1>Jurgen Klopp confirms Mo Salah will be back for Napoli clash</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:02:21+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has issued a positive injury update on Mohamed Salah, after the Egyptian sat out of the Reds’ 2-1 win over Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>The forward has been nursing an injury for the best part of the season thus far, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/liverpool-injury-news-mohamed-salah-ankle-latest-a9214821.html">as reported by the Independent</a>, and has marched on regardless, but was given a much needed break over the weekend.</p>
      <p>As quoted by the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/jurgen-klopp-gives-mo-salah-20948725">Daily Mirror</a>, Klopp said: “<b>Mo is all good. He couldn’t train for nine days. </b><b>He was with Egypt, went home, trained 60-70% the day before yesterday, and was first time 100% yesterday.</b></p>
      <p>“<b>We had to make the decision whether to start him or not. We didn’t start him, we were about to bring him on when we scored the winner (with five minutes remaining).</b></p>
      <p>“<b>So we could rest him today. That’s really good. Wednesday he will be back.</b>”</p>
      <p>Sadio Mane and Bobby Firmino took centre stage as Mo watched on with a smile on his face. The lads got the job done, and now it’s all eyes on Napoli.</p>
      <p>The Italians are next up for Liverpool in the Champions League, with the Reds hoping for revenge after losing to the Naples outfit earlier this season.</p>
      <p>And having Salah back in the side will be cause for a huge sigh of relief from Liverpool supporters as the tricky winger is proven as one of our finest players in recent years.</p>
      <p>Hopefully the sense of occasion at Anfield, which has caused many other teams to fall in the past, will be too much for Napoli on Wednesday night.</p>
