      <h1>Inside Gemma Collins' pink-heavy new pad - including a giant gorilla statue</h1>
      <h2>The GC's always been one for pink and attitude, but her new house takes things to the next level by combining bold colour with traditional vibes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>The Diva Forever herself, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/gemma-collins">Gemma Collins</a> , doesn't shy away from a bold style statement or two - and her fancy new pad is no exception.</p>
      <p>The 36 year old moved into the Essex barn conversion - or Gemmawood, as she named it - back in August to get a taste of the country life, far from busy Brentwood.</p>
      <p>It's not got quite the traditional, old timey feel you might think.</p>
      <p>Gemma recently took to her <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> stories to share with fans that she was having a big old sort out of all her stuff.</p>
      <p>Clothes strewn about the place, fans were given a glimpse of the classy wooden beams in the walls and the small, white windows.</p>
      <p>What they might not have been expecting was the giant pink gorilla statue, sat cross-legged on a golden plinth - she's really showing off her animal-lover credentials.</p>

      <p>We also catch a view of her radioactively pink carpet, as well as a blindingly golden pig statue being used as legs for a glass table.</p>
      <p>"What's going on here today?" Gemma asked from behind the camera.</p>
      <p>The star continued, focusing on the gorilla: "Ceasar is with us! From Planet of the Apes. I've painted him pink."</p>

      <p>The GC added: "We are having another major sort out for my de-pop, but I am filming TOWIE today, the Christmas special! So I'm just deciding what to wear."</p>
      <p>Gemma cuts to a pal - wrapped in a fluffy pink jacket - playing with a dog, who clearly loves pink as much as Gemma as he tries to claim it for his own.</p>
      <p>There's more gold on a table behind, as well as yet another animal - this time a monochrome pink horse, paired with salmon pink curtains.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, we don't get a look at any palm trees decorated with lights that she fancied when she first moved in.</p>
      <p>She's previously dished to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7453021/Gemma-Collins-EXCLUSIVE-Star-relocated-massive-house-pink-carpets-country.html">MailOnline</a> : "I've moved to the country, I love London, and obviously one day I'd like to move to LA, but for now it's the country and I love it."</p>
      <p>She added: "I have been everywhere, but I love the country, with the trees and the nature and the rain. And autumn is a time for change. I am in my own little zone here."</p>
      <p>Gemma continued that the country feels like a getaway because no one knows who she is.</p>
      <p>"I can just go to the market, the farm shop," she said, "I am so happy here. I can finally say, 'There's no place like home.'</p>
      <p>"I'm just settled here. It's been absolutely cosmic ordering."</p>
