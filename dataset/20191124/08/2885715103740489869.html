      <p>Ananya Panday, who is busy with the promotions of her upcoming film <i>Pati Patni Aur Woh, </i>was recently spotted in three different looks. While she disappointed in one, she impressed in the other two.</p>
      <p>The actor had recently stepped out donning an ensemble from Nisse consisting of a white shirt that was paired with an asymmetrical skirt. The outfit stood out for the feather detailing. The intention was perhaps to re-create a retro-look evident in the way the look was rounded out with curls and the shades.</p>
      <p>While it is great to see her experimenting, the look just did not work for not really coming together.</p>

It was Styled by celebrity stylist Ami Patel, the look was rounded out with dewy make-up and a nude shade of lipstick. Messy hairdo completed the look.</p>
