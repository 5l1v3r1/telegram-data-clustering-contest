      <h1>State spent €300k on security for Harry and Meghan visit, €11m to protect Donald Trump</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:41:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>The Irish taxpayer spent nearly €300,000 for guarding Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan Markle during their visit in July 2018.</p>

      <p>The Sunday Independent reports that the State paid out nearly €3m to guard US vice-president Mike Pence in September, while it cost €11m to protect US President Donald Trump during his visit last June.</p>
