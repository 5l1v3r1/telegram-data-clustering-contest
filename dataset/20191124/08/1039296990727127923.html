      <p>The partnership is meant to improve ground transport for differently abled individuals travelling to and from train stations.</p>
      <p>Ezy Mov is one of a few wheelchair-accessible transport services in our country; and it is based out of Mumbai. The company's main aim is to provide easy and safe transport for differently abled individuals. Now, Ezy Mov and the Indian Railways have initiated a tie-up to start a pilot project that will provide transportation to and from select railway stations for differently abled individuals.</p>
      <p>The Project will make use of Ezy Movâ€™s wheelchair-accessible transport to ferry people to and from nine different railway termini across Mumbai. This project is expected to commence from January 2020 and the service will be available to book from the Indian Railways website, as well as directly via Ezy Mov.</p>
      <p>Some of the vehicles used by Ezy Mov are the Tata Winger and the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/maruti-suzuki/eeco"><b>Maruti Suzuki Eeco</b></a>, which all come equipped with either a ramp for wheelchair access, or a wheelchair lift.</p>
