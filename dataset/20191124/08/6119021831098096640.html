      <p>However, the Shiv Sena voted in favour of NCP, continued the stand adopted by its state leaders in trying to form a government with the NCP and Congress.</p>
      <p>Speaking to mid-day, Mohol said, "The BJP manifesto work that was promised will be taken ahead of and the long-time pending that the corporation must have its own medical campus and college will be work on."</p>
