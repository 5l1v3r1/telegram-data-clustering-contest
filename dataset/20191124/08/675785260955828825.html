      <h1>Man Utd predicted line-up vs Sheffield United as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer considers midfield</h1>
      <h2>Man Utd will be without Paul Pogba, Scott McTominay Eric Bailly, Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Diogo Dalot but Nemanja Matic should make his return against Sheffield United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:36:43+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:36</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is considering his midfield options with first-choice stars Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay absent for Manchester United's Premier League fixture with Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils travel to Bramell Lane on Sunday afternoon aiming to extend their winning run to three matches - having beaten Partizan Belgrade and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> before the international break.</p>
      <p>They will have to do so without long-term lay-off Pogba and McTominay - who has been one of Solskjaer's most consistent performers this season.</p>
      <p>France international Pogba has been injured since the end of September, after damaging his ankle, and could now be out until the New Year.</p>

      <p>While Scot McTominay pulled out of international duty with an ankle problem and could be away for a few weeks.</p>
      <p>â€œScotty hurt his ankle and will be out for a couple of weeks," stated Solskjaer, for whom Nemanja Matic is available - but has only just returned from a month on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Matic is expected to face the Blades for just his fourth appearances of the season, and his first in the Premier League since he was replaced against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on September 22.</p>

      <p>He will likely line-up alongside Fred and Andreas Pereira - who have both seen plenty of action already this season, with the latter netting the opener in the victory over Brighton.</p>
      <p>At the back, Solskjaer is set to name an unchanged back-five - with David de Gea in goal protected by Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof and youngster Brandon Williams.</p>
      <p>Eric Bailly, Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Diogo Dalot are stepping up their rehabilitation from injury, but all will miss out.</p>
      <p>Luke Shaw and Axel Tuanzebe are available but lacking match fitness, while club captain Ashley Young is available after suspension.</p>
      <p>Up front Marcus Rashford will be hoping to continue his purple patch - he has scored 10 goals in his last 11 outings for club and country.</p>
      <p>Daniel James and Anthony Martial will probably link up with him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Manchester United predicted XI:</b>
        <i>De Gea; Wan-Bissaka, Maguire, Lindelof, Williams; Fred, Matic, Pereira; James, Martial, Rashford</i>
