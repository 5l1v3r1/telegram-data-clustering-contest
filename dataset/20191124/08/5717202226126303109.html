      <h1>Luton Town boss speaks of frightening Leeds United under Marcelo Bielsa</h1>
      <h2>Leeds United defeated Luton in the Championship yesterday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:15:41+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Luton Town boss Graeme Jones has been discussing the club’s recent clash with Leeds United, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woM5T9Mfzjw">shown by Luton Town’s official YouTube account. </a>He admitted holding back on some of the preparation for the game fearing it could scare his players. </p>
      <p>Leeds United claimed a hard-fought 2-1 win at Kenilworth Road yesterday, with Patrick Bamford’s brace enough for all three points. </p>

      <p>Speaking after the game, which Luton were extremely unfortunate to lose, Jones spoke of his admiration for the Leeds boss from his time at Athletic Bilbao and Marseille. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“The opponent’s outstanding.</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>“Some clips I didn’t show the boys because it would have frightened the living daylights out of them, they can really cut you open if you go after them.</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>“Marcelo’s a guy I’ve got huge respect for and his work worldwide. I saw his Marseille teams, I saw his Bilbao teams, so I’ve played against his league teams.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>TBR’s View</b>
      </p>
      <p>There is no doubt that Leeds and Bielsa are proving themselves to be one of the best teams in the Championship. Slaven Bilic and West Brom might have something to say about that statement, but plenty of opposing managers have all said the same thing about Bielsa’s men so far this season. </p>
      <p>Luton put up an excellent fight and, in the end, it was a late goal that ended up downing the Hatters. </p>
      <p>But it seems not over-exposing his players to Leeds’ better points might have been a good decision from Jones, considering the quality of Luton’s display. </p>
      <p>Leeds fans will just be pleased they managed to come away with three points from what was a tough day at the office.</p>
