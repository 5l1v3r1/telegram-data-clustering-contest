      <h1>Saudi rises for a sixth day, Dubai gains on financials</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:32:24+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:32</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Saudi Arabia’s stock market rose in early trade on Sunday and was set for a sixth straight session of gains, led by banking shares, which also bolstered the Dubai index.</p>
      <p>The benchmark Saudi index edged up 0.1%, with the kingdom’s largest lender National Commercial Bank increasing 1.6%, and Saudi British Bank gaining 1%.</p>
      <p>The country’s banking sector continues to enjoy a high level of liquidity, the kingdom’s central bank governor said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The statement could allay market fears that Saudi oil giant Aramco’s initial public offering (IPO) – which could be the world’s largest so far – might soak up market liquidity as Saudi investors direct their wealth towards the offering.</p>
      <p>The IPO has attracted approximately 73 billion riyals ($19.5 billion) in institutional and retail orders so far, Saudi Arabia’s Samba Financial Group said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Dubai index rose 0.3%, helped by a 0.4% rise in Dubai Islamic Bank and a 3% gain in its top lender Emirates NBD.</p>
      <p>Qatar’s index inched up 0.1%, as Qatar International Islamic Bank advanced 2.2% and the Gulf’s largest lender Qatar National Bank added 0.3%.</p>
      <p>In Abu Dhabi, the index was flat, with market heavyweight First Abu Dhabi Bank easing 0.1%, but Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank up 0.8%.</p>
