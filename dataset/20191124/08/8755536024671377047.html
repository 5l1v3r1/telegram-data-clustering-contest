      <p>A source told <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1096520/there-s-nothing-going-on-between-justin-timberlake-and-alisha-wainwright-despite-hand-holding-sources-say">E! News</a> however that “there is absolutely nothing going on between them.”</p>
      <p>“They were out with all the cast, crew, makeup artists, and everyone was just hanging out in a social setting,” the insider claimed.</p>
      <p>“They are just working together. No validity to any other rumor other than that they are filming together.”</p>
