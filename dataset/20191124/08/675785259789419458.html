      <p>The search continues to find a British man who has been missing in Australia for two days after he hit his head while camping.</p>
      <p>Aslan King was last seen in the early hours of Saturday morning after suffering what friends have said could be a possible form of seizure during his trip.</p>
      <p>Mr King is believed to have hit his head on the ground before getting up quickly and rushing into thick bushland in Victoria.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old is an illustrator from Bristol who arrived in Australia two weeks ago and was staying at the campsite next to the bushland with four friends.</p>
      <p>A detailed search involving a helicopter, boats and mounted police failed to find any trace of him.</p>

      <p>Victoria Police said officers using a helicopter, horses, motorcycles and sniffer dogs are continuing the search.</p>
      <p>Local media also showed water-borne police officers checking along the coastline in rubber dinghies.</p>
      <p>Police told local media they were concentrating on a radius of 300 metres around the campsite, but said the search was difficult because of the thick vegetation, rocky clifftops and deep water coastal waters in the region.</p>
      <p>The area is also known to contain a large population of deadly tiger snakes.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Danny Brown of Victoria Police said thermal imaging sensors used on Saturday and Sunday had detected no trace of Mr King, but that they might be used again as the search continued on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>"You're using every sense, whether that be eyes, ears and touch as well," he told Nine newspapers, adding the heat sensors would make "a massive difference, because we're going to find things in areas that the eye can't see".</p>
      <p>"Some of this scrub, you have to get on hands and knees to move through it," he said.</p>

      <p>Sgt Brown said Mr King's friends and family had described his disappearance as "completely out of character".</p>
      <p>James Stalley posted on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> : "Never in a million years did I think I'd ever, ever be this person but my very dear friend Aslan is missing!!!</p>
      <p>"Any Aussie connections on here please share in the hope he is found safe. He is supposed to be joining us at my wedding in Bali."</p>
      <p>The Foreign Office said in a statement: "Our staff are seeking further information following the disappearance of a British man near Princeton, Australia and are in contact with the Australian police."</p>
