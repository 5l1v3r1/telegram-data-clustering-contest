      <h1>Powell v Powell: Kieran's 125-ball 105 trumps Rovman's 38-ball ton</h1>

        <i><b>Leeward Islands</b> 255 for 8 (Kieran Powell 105, Jangoo 69, Thomas 3-59) beat <b>Jamaica</b> 242 (Rovman Powell 106, Boatswain 4-85) by 13 runs</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/820351.html">Rovman Powell</a> hit a blistering 38-ball century - <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/223833.html">the fifth fastest in men's List A cricket</a> - against Leeward Islands, but his ton was not enough for Jamaica to avert a 13-run loss in a chase of 256 at the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8853/scorecard/1203660/jamaica-vs-leeward-islands-group-a-super50-cup-2019-20">Super50 Cup in Basseterre</a>, as they folded for 242 in 28.3 overs.</p>
      <p>Rovman, the Jamaica captain, steered the better part of Jamaica's chase from No. 5, stitching together three 40-plus partnerships, including a sixth-wicket half-century stand with Derval Green, to take his side past 150. However, once his 40-ball 106, featuring 13 fours and seven sixes, came to an end in the last ball of the 15th over, courtesy <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/333043.html">Quinton Boatswain</a>, who had him caught behind, the rearguard proved inadequate.</p>
      <p>Aside from Rovman, who was adjudged the Player of the Match, none of the Jamaica batsmen could make a fifty. That the next best score from their line-up was a mere 26-ball 30, struck by No. 8 Jamie Merchant, was in part down to Boatswain's 4 for 85. Boatswain was complemented well by Sheeno Berridge and Jason Campbell, who took two wickets apiece.</p>

      <p>The other century in the match came from the Powell in the opposition camp, <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/252932.html">Kieran</a>, and stood in sharp contrast to Rovman's. Built on 13 fours and no sixes, the Leeward Islands opener's 125-ball 105, however, anchored his side's 255 for 8 after they were sent in.</p>
      <p>Kieran's big 154-run second-wicket stand with half-centurion <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/820681.html">Amir Jangoo</a> in 29 overs set them the perfect platform to eye a total close to 300. However, medium-pacer Green's double-strike in the 35th over accounted for Kieran and then sent back No. 4 Devon Thomas for a duck.</p>
      <p>Kieran's dismissal also triggered a collapse that saw them lose four wickets for eight runs, and then five for 23, with Jamaica reduced to 214 for 6 in the 43rd over. During that slump, Jangoo holed out to Oshane Thomas for an enterprising 85-ball 69. Thomas later capped off his day with the ball with 3 for 59, as Leeward finished on 255 for 8.</p>
