            <b>MUM vs JHA Dream11 : After losing their previous Super League match against Tamil Nadu, tournament favourites Mumbai will look to bounce back in their 2<sup>nd</sup> super league game against Jharkhand</b>
          </p>
          <p>Despite having several international stars in their ranks, Mumbai just managed to score 121 against Tamil Nadu which was never going to be a challenge for a star- studded batting line-up like Tamil Nadu.</p>
          <p>Mumbai have some stalwarts in their ranks having the experience of playing at the highest level. Jharkhand, on the other hand, has lost both their previous clashes and will look to make amends against a top-quality team. It will be a matter of time for a champion side like Mumbai to get back to winning ways. They have played some impressive cricket and won 7 games in 1<sup>st</sup> round of the competition barring a shock loss at the hands of Meghalaya.</p>

                <h3>Match Conditions and Toss</h3>

Spinners have got some assistance from the pitch as the match has progressed. The general norm here has been win the toss and put the oppositions in. It shouldn’t be any different today when Mumbai and Jharkhand lock horns against each other later today.</p>

                            <h3>MUM vs JHA Dream 11 Wicket-keeper</h3>
                            <p><b>Aditya Tare</b> will be our one and only pick in this segment. He has been a responsible player for Mumbai over the years and has bulk of experience under him. He scored a magnificent 82 against Assam and a stroke-filled 7 against Madhya Pradesh.</p>
                            <h3>MUM vs JHA Dream 11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p><b>Prithvi Shaw</b> will be our first pick in this segment. He is not only a powerful striker but a good timer of the ball. Shaw announced his return to competitive cricket with a great half-century against Assam and followed it up with a 30 against Tamil Nadu.</p>
                            <p><b>Suryakumar Yadav</b> will be our 2<sup>nd</sup> pick in this segment. He scored consecutive ducks in the last two matches. However, given his class a big knock might just be around the corner and we cannot him out.</p>
                            <p><b>Shreyas Iyer</b> will be our 3<sup>rd</sup> pick. He has been in sensational hitting form in the recent past which was quite evident during the T20 series against Bangladesh. He hasn’t been in the best of form in the competition. However as they say form is temporary and class is permanent, we might just see a big knock from Iyer later today.</p>
                            <p><b>Virat Singh</b> will be our first pick from Jharkhand. He is a good striker of the ball and has been in good shape in the tournament. He scored a brilliant 76 against Karnataka in the previous clash.</p>
                            <p><b>Sumit Kumar</b> will be our next pick in this segment. He has looked in good touch and scored a quickfire 23 of 16 deliveries in the previous clash against Karnataka.</p>
                            <h3>MUM vs JHA Dream 11 All-rounders</h3>
                            <p><b>Shivam Dube</b> will be our first pick in this segment. He has already made a mark for himself in the national colours after a match-winning spell against Bangladesh in the final T20I. He is also a powerful striker of the ball and can change the complexion of the match in a matter of few deliveries.</p>
                            <p><b>Anukul Roy</b> will be our 2<sup>nd</sup> and last pick in this segment. He has been among the wickets in the tournament. Anukul is a useful left-arm spinner who has the ability to get purchase from the wicket.</p>
                            <h3>MUM vs JHA Dream11 Bowlers</h3>
                            <p><b>Shahbaz Nadeem</b> will be our first pick among bowlers. He has been among the wickets and bagged a couple of wickets against Punjab in his previous game.</p>
                            <p><b>Dhawal Kulkarni</b> will be our 2<sup>nd</sup> pick. He hasn’t been among the wickets but he is an experienced lad and will look to be among the wickets later today.</p>
                            <p>The last pick of our Dream 11 Team will be <b>Shams Mulani</b> who has been one of the primary wicket-takers for Jharkhand. He also scored a brilliant 73 against Tamil Nadu and bagged 3 wickets.</p>
                            <h3>Captain and Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Prithvi Shaw will be captain of the day and Shams Mulani will be the vice-captain.</p>
