      <h1>Chilling 'beauty in the bath' murder that rocked Merseyside and left detectives baffled</h1>
      <h2>The case sent shockwaves through the quiet suburban street where Cynthia Bolshaw's body was found</h2>

      <p>"We are so sorry she is not here today."</p>
      <p>These were the words a murdered <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wirral">Wirral</a> woman's family uttered 20 years ago, on the day her killer was jailed.</p>
      <p>The painful statement came after an agonising 16 years spent searching for justice after Cynthia Bolshaw was strangled to death in her own <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/heswall">Heswall</a> home.</p>
      <p>Cynthia, a beautiful and "very caring woman", died in tragic and mysterious circumstances in a case that case shocked the nation.</p>

      <p>The 50-year-old Dior beautician was found lying face down and naked in a bath, leading to her case becoming known as the 'beauty in the bath' murder.</p>
      <p>John Taft, a then 49-year-old glazing company director, was ultimately found guilty of her murder after a dramatic 10-day trial at Liverpool Crown Court.</p>
      <p>On the 20th anniversary of his conviction, we took a look back on the shocking case.</p>
      <h3>"They expected to see her car in the drive way"</h3>

      <p>Cynthia was a woman who had everything to live for.</p>
      <p>She had a good job working in Browns, in Chester, was a mother and regarded as being very popular.</p>
      <p>On November 9, 1983, her lifeless, naked body was found by relatives who had been visiting her bungalow on Buffs Lane.</p>
      <p>Her red Toyota Corolla was found abandoned in a field of the northbound carriageway of the A450 Chester High Road by a policeman.</p>
      <p>Detective Superintendent Jim Owens said Cynthia's sister and brother-in-law had called into the bungalow when they made the discovery.</p>

      <p>He said: "They expected to see her car in the driveway and the curtains open. But they found the car was not there, and there was no answer.</p>
      <p>"They entered the house and found her dead in the bath."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">The ECHO</a> sought to find the officers who responded to the scene that day, but were told many of those working have since retired, or left the force.</p>
      <p>Her murder sent shockwaves through the quiet suburban area where she lived, as house-to-house enquires were carried out the next day.</p>
      <p>Neighbour Elizabeth Lawrence said at the time : "I'm very sorry to hear about her. It is a tragedy."</p>
      <h3>The hunt for Cynthia's killer</h3>

        <figcaption>A huge search operation was launched after her death<cite>(Image: Liverpool Echo)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A major manhunt was launched to find Cynthia's killer as police worked round the clock on the case.</p>
      <p>Described by police as the biggest murder investigation in Wirral since the brutal killing of air stewardess Hazel Booth in Wirral Way County Park, the case had 100 officers working on it at its peak.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of people from the area, and who Cynthia may have had contact with, were interviewed.</p>
      <p>A dramatic turn in the case came when Det Supt Owens directly urged for a mysterious caller, who claimed to have information, to meet him.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Just under a week after Cynthia's murder the CID chief received a call, from someone he believed held vital clues to Cynthia's killer.</p>
      <p>Det Supt Owens appealed directly to the mystery called through <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">the ECHO.</a></p>
      <p>He said: "I am willing to meet the person at any time or any place at their convenience."</p>
      <p>Cynthia's diary, which a court later heard contained the names of up to 200 men, was also presented as a significant clue and the potential key to tracking down her killer.</p>
      <p>Focus turned onto Cynthia's personal life, as the court would later be told she had many relationships after divorcing from her husband.</p>
      <p>It was thought her killer could have been a current or ex-partner of hers.</p>
      <h3>16 years of searching - the case goes cold</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Despite the hours of work, hundreds of officers and countless doors knocked, the case went cold.</p>
      <p>No one was charged for Cynthia's murder and officers were left scratching their heads.</p>
      <p>Detectives traced hundreds of men after going through diaries belonging to Cynthia, dating back 15 years.</p>
      <p>On each anniversary of Cynthia's death, police appealed again to members of the public to come forward - but an arrest would not come for years.</p>
      <h3>"We've got your print"</h3>

      <p>In March 1999 a huge breakthrough was made by police.</p>
      <p>A man called John Taft had confided in his wife he had known Cynthia and asked her to provide an alibi for him for the night she died.</p>
      <p>But Barbara, Taft's first wife, finally approached police in 1999.</p>
      <p>She said she had "something to tell them" and provided a dramatic shift in the case.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>She confessed Taft wanted her to say she was at home with him on the night of the murder.</p>
      <p>Taft had, in fact, visited Cynthia that evening.</p>
      <p>Former lovers of Cynthia's were traced and asked to provide DNA, as <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/merseyside-police">Merseyside Police</a> revealed they had obtained a "genetic fingerprint" of the prime suspect in the hunt for her killer.</p>
      <p>Police even warned former partners, saying: "Contact us before we come and find you."</p>
      <p>After years of dead ends, the case gained momentum again and it finally began to look like Cynthia could get justice.</p>
      <h3>A breakthrough in forensic evidence leads to Taft's arrest</h3>

      <p>In April 1999, one month after the force's chilling warning, Taft was arrested after advances in forensic technlogy.</p>
      <p>Some 64 men were interviewed before his arrest and during the initial investigation more than 1,500 statements were taken.</p>
      <p>The repeat calls Det Supt Owens received early on in the case ultimately turned out to be a hoax – costing officers hours of valuable time in the search for Cynthia's killer.</p>
      <p>A 36-year-old woman was subsequently convicted of wasting police time.</p>
      <p>Taft was charged with murder and a trial began in Liverpool Crown Court in November 1999.</p>
      <p>The jury of eight women and four men heard intimate details about Cynthia’s sex life as extracts from her diaries were read aloud.</p>
      <p>Taft continued to deny having any role in Cynthia's death.</p>
      <h3>"We sat and talked. We then started pecking and ended up making love on the bed"</h3>

      <p>After years of waiting, a trial for Cynthia's murder finally came.</p>
      <p>A courtroom packed with reporters, Cynthia's loved ones and Taft's wife Susan watched on as the business owner entered the dock.</p>
      <p>He had, extraordinarily, been interviewed by police during the initial inquiry but he said he never met Cynthia.</p>
      <p>The pair had met many times though - as Taft's testimony would go on to reveal.</p>
      <p>The court heard Cynthia had requested a quote from the glazing firm he worked for and the pair formed a bond after he visited her home.</p>
      <p>Very intimate details of Cynthia's personal life were aired in court, with jurors told about her sexual partners.</p>
      <p>But it was not until the middle of the trial that Taft finally came clean about their relationship.</p>

      <p>Oliver Blunt QC, defending, asked him: "Did you kill Cynthia Bolshaw?"</p>
      <p>Taft told him they had an affair that started after she called him. He said: "We sat and talked. We then started pecking and ended up making love on the bed. We were both naked.</p>
      <p>"After that she would normally phone me at work, but we had difficulty meeting because she was working and I was married."</p>
      <p>On the night of her death, Taft claimed he went round to her home and after the pair had sex he left at about 10.30pm. Cynthia was alive and unharmed when he left, he said.</p>
      <p>He added: "I had no reason to hurt Mrs Bolshaw. She was a very bubbly and bright person and I enjoyed her company."</p>
      <h3>“Why you killed her will never be known, except by you”</h3>

      <p>On November 24, 1999 the ECHO’s front page simply read 'GUILTY'.</p>
      <p>Taft was handed a life sentence by Judge David Clark QC, who told him: “Why you killed her will never be known, except by you.”</p>
      <p>His guilty conviction came after the jury were told DNA of his was found on Cynthia's underwear.</p>
      <p>The jury convicted Taft by a 10 to 2 majority verdict.</p>
      <p>As Taft was told his fate he closed his eyes, put his hands on his head and turned to his second wife Susan.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">The ECHO</a> reported Taft told her: “I love you, you know the truth.”</p>
      <p>The couple had married just 17 days before his arrest for the crime.</p>
      <p>Judge Clark QC said: “What is clear is that you kept quiet for 16 years and never told the truth about what took place that night.</p>
      <p>“You are an intelligent and calculating man who has never shown any remorse.”</p>
      <p>Cynthia’s son Christopher spoke of the devastating toll the trial had on the family.</p>
      <p>On the day of the sentence, he said: “We are absolutely delighted with the result. It was [an] absolutely convincing case. We know that he did it.</p>
      <p>“The police have been extremely supportive throughout the past 16 years, but nothing is going to bring my mum back.</p>
      <p>“We also feel very sorry for Susan Taft. It has been going on for such a long time.”</p>
      <p>Taft later went on to appeal his sentence. The case looked like it could be re-opened after it was alleged a bundle of evidence had led to an incorrect conviction.</p>
      <p>Wirral lawyer David Kiran told <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">the ECHO</a> in 2009: “Within an hour of getting this case and considering some of the early points raised by Taft and the family, I thought it was a serious miscarriage of justice. It’s a bad case.”</p>
      <p>It is understood Taft was released from prison some years ago.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Cynthia would have turned 86 in July if her life had not been tragically cut short.</p>
      <p>Born in Liverpool as the youngest of four children to Elsie and Charles Wilson, Cynthia grew up in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/west-kirby">West Kirby</a> and helped out at the family-run bookshop as a youngster.</p>
      <p>Cynthia got married and had her son, Christopher, living with her family in Burton, Wirral, before divorcing her husband.</p>
      <p>After Taft’s sentence, then 42-year-old Christopher spoke with pride about his mother while paying tribute to her.</p>
      <p>He said: “My mum was a very caring and gentle and caring woman and very good to us.</p>
      <p>“I was very proud of her. “</p>
      <p>Cynthia’s daughter-in-law Gaye Bolshaw added outside of court: “She was a lovely, gentle woman and we are just so sorry that she is not here today to see her grandchildren grow up.</p>
      <p>“Nothing will ever bring Cynthia back, but we all loved her and we know she loved all of us.”</p>
