      <p>Oman yesterday arrived in Doha, hoping to successfully defend the Arabian Gulf Cup title they won two years back in Kuwait.  </p>
      <p>The Red Warriors are looking to win their second successive and third overall title at the 24th edition of the tournament which will take place from November 26 to December 8 in Doha.</p>
      <p>Oman, ranked 77 on the FIFA computer, will be hoping for a strong showing in the region’s top tournament.</p>
      <p>In the last championship in Kuwait, Oman defeated UAE on penalties to win the regional title. Oman first won the Gulf Cup in 2009, while playing at home,</p>
      <p>The defending champions’ Dutch coach Erwin Koeman has finalised a 23-man squad for the prestigious event.</p>
      <p>“I knew the importance of the Gulf Cup to the Omanis. Playing two matches within one day rest in between will be tough but we have to adapt to that and deliver top performance during the tournament,” said 58-year-old former midfielder, who was part of the Dutch team which won the Euro title in 1998.</p>
      <p>Eight nations based in the region are taking part in the prestigious tournament including hosts Qatar alongside Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Yemen.</p>
      <p>Oman are placed in Group B alongside Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain while hosts Qatar will play against Iraq, UAE and Yemen in Group B. The defending champions will commence their campaign with a match Bahrain on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The ‘Red Warriors’ will meet Kuwait, who are ten times Gulf Cup champions on November 30 while the last match of the group stage will be against Saudi Arabia on December 2.</p>
      <p>The top two sides from each group will qualify to the semi-finals, the final is set to take place on December 8 at the Khalifa International Stadium.</p>
