      <h1>Mogoeng Mogoeng Says The Land Issue Will Be Handled In A Unifying Manner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:42:59+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/sporteditor/" target="_blank">SW Editor</a></address>
      <p>Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has called for the intensifying of efforts to address land inequalities in South Africa.</p>
      <p>Mogoeng delivered the 17th annual Nelson Mandela lecture in Soweto on Saturday, under the theme “Constitutionalism as an Instrument for Transformation”.</p>
      <p>He called the land issue ‘critical’ and urged all those involved in addressing it to resolve it peacefully.</p>
      <p>A special committee in Parliament is working on proposals to change the Constitution to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation – a move that has divided Members of Parliament.</p>
      <p>“We are going to be unifiers; we are going to be reconcilers; we are going to spend every day to ensure that the land issue, and all other outstanding issues, are resolved in a manner that keeps us united and reconciled.”</p>
      <p>Mogoeng also lamented the growing gap between the rich and the poor people of South Africa, saying it was a shame that since the advent of South Africa’s constitutional democracy in 1994, inequality had become “sharper” than during the apartheid era.</p>
      <p>“It really is a shame that 25 years down the line we still have so many of our people suffering as much as they do. It is a shame that inequality has become sharper during our Constitutional democracy than during apartheid, and check who is at the top,” Mogoeng added.</p>
