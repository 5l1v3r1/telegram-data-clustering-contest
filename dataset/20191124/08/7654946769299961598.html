      <h1>NFL Week 12 predictions: Seahawks a live road underdog</h1>

      <p><b>Seahawks (+1½) over EAGLES:</b> The start time has shifted from prime time to 1 p.m., though early kickoffs have had minimal adverse effects on visitors of late, aiding Seattle’s remarkable road resilience (4-0 this season). Quarterback form compels us to give the best of it to the Hawks’ Russell Wilson over the Eagles’ Carson Wentz. The Eagles need to arrive at their Week 16 Dallas date at the Linc relatively healthy.</p>
      <p><b>Giants (+6) over BEARS:</b> Chicago finds itself reproducing circumstances the club has so often endured: the defense staring balefully at the offense, begging Mitch Trubisky or Chase Daniel to find a way. The Bears are gifted with the chance to operate against one of the league’s weakest secondaries. If we’ve seen the worst of Daniel Jones, this could be competitive, at the market.</p>
      <p><b>Raiders (-3) over JETS:</b> Sam Darnold may have regained measure of confidence off wins over Giants and Redskins — though this is a significant step up in class. Acknowledge concern regarding health issues the Silver and Black’s secondary has endured of late.</p>
      <p><b>Dolphins (+10½) over BROWNS:</b> Cleveland has gotten past the toughest stretch of their schedule, but need to close 5-1 or better to have viable postseason shot. That visit to Arizona followed by an invasion by the Ravens won’t be easy, especially without defensive ace Myles Garrett. Even with a dubious running game, Miami is an eternal backdoor threat with Ryan Fitzpatrick at QB.</p>
      <p><b>BILLS (-4) over Broncos:</b> Nobody is giving anything away here, with wise guys having already skimmed the cream off what tangible spread advantage existed on the underdog side of this equation.</p>

      <p><b>BENGALS (+6¹/₂) over Steelers:</b> Pittsburgh rode its defense to success against the Rams, but then couldn’t hack a Thursday night road trip to Cleveland. The Bengals hung around vs. Oakland largely due to lapses in concentration by multiple Raiders. No WR JuJu Smith-Schuster or RB James Conner for visitors.</p>
      <p><b>SAINTS (-9½) over Panthers:</b> New Orleans delivered an expected rebound vs. the Buccaneers off a bad Superdome loss to the revived Falcons. Even with the all-world Christian McCaffrey at running back, Carolina is enduring midseason pains behind regressing QB Kyle Allen, who’s lofted nine picks in his past four games.</p>
      <p><b>Buccaneers (+4½) at FALCONS:</b> Atlanta cleared up multitude of sins during its bye, and proceeded to snuff Saints and Panthers by a combined 55-12 — easing pressures on coach Dan Quinn. This is a challenging call, given Atlanta has valuable skill pieces (Matt Ryan, et al) up against QB Jameis Winston, desperate to ease the pressure on the Bucs’ yielding secondary.</p>
      <p><b>Lions (-3½) over REDSKINS:</b> Both sides are trotting out skill people impersonating frontline NFL quarterback talent (Jeff Driskel for the visitors, Dwayne Haskins for the hosts). Haskins is eager to lead, but his experience/talent level falls short of the executive class, and Haskins’ supporting cast is struggling.</p>
      <p><b>Jaguars (+3) over TITANS:</b> Jacksonville is a book play, so we’ll swing that way, but still need to see Nick Foles enjoy sustained league success in a role other than the Honest Workman stepping in for the injured Wentz and leading a superior Eagles roster/organization to their well-deserved Super Bowl title.</p>
      <p><b>PATRIOTS (-6½) over Cowboys:</b> You’re getting New England at a reasonable price, facing a franchise that’s the glamorous darling of millions of fans who only see sunshine and flowers. The Pats are concerned about Tom Brady’s elbow, though he’ll start, and they know how to do more with less — a valuable skill, up against an organization where so many have made careers of doing less with more in recent times.</p>
      <p><b>Packers (+3) over 49ERS:</b> San Francisco’s timeline reflects a perfect first half of the season against lesser opponents. A tight home loss to the Seahawks led into a narrow escape against Arizona, though Jimmy Garoppolo had to pass 45 times! Their defense has yielded 26 points per game in their past three, with road trips to Baltimore and New Orleans on deck. The Niners are without multiple key people, including bulwark LT Joe Staley.</p>
      <h3>Monday</h3>
      <p><b>RAMS (+3) over Ravens:</b> Lamar Jackson is miles ahead of Jared Goff, and L.A. is enduring significant injury issues along its fronts — though we’re concerned the Ravens may have peaked too soon offensively, given their 157-point output in their past four games. Baltimore is in enviable shape going forward, especially should they get by this (and their home date against San Francisco next week).</p>
      <p><b>Last week:</b> 5-8.<br/><b>Season:</b> 79-68-2.<br/><i>Follow Richard Witt on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/rich_witt1?lang=en">@rich_witt1</a></i></p>
