        <b>TRNSMT is making its much anticipated return to Glasgow next summer - and organisers are already promising another "memorable weekend".</b>

        <figcaption>TRNSMT has been a roaring success in recent years</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>We previously told how the 2019 line-up was announced in a huge live reveal where fans had to solve cryptic song lyrics to piece together the headliners.</p>
      <p>And this year, bosses have announced they're taking the puzzle to another level - with a giant digital treasure hunt on the streets of Scotland.</p>
      <p>Hopeful festival punters will be given tip-offs about venues and locations, with correct answers taking them to find interactive badges and artist names.</p>
      <p>Once they have identified the artists the next step is to share them on your social media for the chance to win free tickets to next year's fest.</p>
      <p>The first clues will be announced at 4pm on November 26.</p>
      <p>Organisers will then reveal the first headliners for the festival at 5pm.</p>
