        <b>Manchester United have been warned by Stan Collymore about potentially missing out on hiring Mauricio Pochettino now that he’s available.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Argentine was sacked by Tottenham at the start of this week, and has since been replaced by former Red Devils boss Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>However, many still expect Pochettino will soon be back in football, and quite possibly at a bigger club than Tottenham after doing so much fine work in his five and a half years in north London.</p>

      <p>It remains to be seen where Pochettino will end up, but Man Utd certainly seem like a club who could do with an upgrade on their current manager.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hasn’t been too impressive in his time at Old Trafford, and is certainly far less proven and experienced at the highest level in comparison to Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Collymore believes the 47-year-old could be ideal for the Red Devils, and has warned them not to miss out now that he’s available or they’re sure to regret it in the future.</p>

      <p>“If you are Ed Woodward and Manchester United, you should already have had a chat with Mauricio Pochettino,” Collymore wrote in his column for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-utd-should-sack-ole-20948567?2">Daily Mirror</a>.</p>
      <p>“The Argentine’s philosophy fits hand in glove with United’s and the respect he gets from players is second to none.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I love Ole, but if he had played for any other club than United, he would not have been in the frame for the job when Mourinho was axed.</p>
      <p>“Poch is a better manager, he has a better track record and he is a better choice for United.</p>
      <p>“And if they don’t take him now, they will deserve all the what-ifs that will come their way in years to come – because he will go somewhere else and get success.”</p>
