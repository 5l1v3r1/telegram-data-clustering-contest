      <p>BUTTERWORTH, Nov 24 — The federal government will remain highly committed to the people and have more programmes for the welfare of the people, said Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng.</p>
      <p>He said the government needed more time and was now working on reviving the economy, after which programmes will be implemented for the benefit of the people.</p>
      <p>“We hope that when the (economic) situation improves, we can launch programmes for the benefit of the people. They are needed but we must be sure we have a strong financial capability,” he told reporters after attending a social welfare programme in Taman Pandan, Butterworth here today.</p>
      <p>Lim said all the promises made by the Pakatan Harapan have to be kept, but it needed time before that could happen.</p>
      <p>“The previous government took five years to keep their word, so if you want to compare, then I hope you give the federal government the same time. Now, we can see a lot of difference, changes, but they are in stages,” he said.</p>
      <p>He added that the people can see the difference between the previous government and the current one, where under the previous government, only their cronies benefited and not the ordinary folks.</p>
      <p>“If previously the ordinary person did not get anything, while only the cronies benefited, now the people can see the difference between a government of the people and a government which is based on cronyism, we hope to ensure that the people benefit, not the cronies,” he said.</p>
      <p>Lim added that the government was always working on its efforts to help sectors which need aid. — Bernama</p>
