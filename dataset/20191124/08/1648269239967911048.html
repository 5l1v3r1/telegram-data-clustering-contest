      <h1>This Mustang Mach-E Police Interceptor Rendering Is A Goon's Bane</h1>
      <h2>Imagine this silently tailing you on the freeway.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:27:12+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/jacob-oliva/" target="_blank">Jacob Oliva</a></address>
      <p>Beyond the controversial name, the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/mach-e/">Ford Mustang Mach-E</a> is one capable electric SUV that can probably outperform a lot – if not all – of its competitors. Its detractors will find it hard to admit that, and that's normal, we reckon.</p>
      <p>But imagine this: a black Mustang Mach-E as a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/police-interceptor-utility/">Police Interceptor Utility</a>, roaming the streets at night in complete stealth of silence, just like <i>Batman</i>. Wouldn't that be terrifying? Well, of course not, unless you're a criminal or someone who likes to go over legal speed limits.</p>

      <p>Thankfully, someone has made a rendering of Mach-E Police Interceptor and it's looking pretty gnarly. The rendering above was made by <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/88391187/2020-Mustang-Mach-E-Police">Aksyonov Nikita at Behance.net</a>. It's a preview of what the Mach-E would look like should Ford decides to replace the current Police Interceptor Utility with the electric Mustang.</p>
      <p>We reckon, the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/explorer/">Explorer</a>-based current Police Interceptor Utility looks already intimidating in its current guise, what more if it's the Mustang Mach-E? If you think about it, the Mach-E fits the bill of being the next factory-built police car by Ford.</p>

      <p>The range-topping Mach-E GT Performance is touted to produce up to 459 horsepower (342 kiloWatts) and 612 pound-feet (830 Nm) of torque. Even better, it can run up to 250 miles in a single charge, which means it would be hard to outrun this electric Mustang during a car chase.</p>
      <p>The idea isn't far-fetched, though. With Ford using the name Mustang for its entry into the electric SUV segment, the possibility is endless. A Ford executive even confirmed that there's a plan to make a Mach-E Shelby. With that said, let's all brace ourselves for what Ford has in store in the future.</p>
