        <b>Alan Browne insisted that Preston North End’s international break curse is not by a lack of preparation on the players end.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Preston have won just two games in the last three years following international breaks, drawing four and losing five.</p>
      <p>Browne played the full 90 against Derby after having featured in both of Republic of Ireland’s games over the break.</p>
      <p>The 1-0 loss to Derby County meant North End dropped one place to third and the Irishman was frank in his assessment of proceedings.</p>
      <p>He said: “We don’t go away and take the mick.</p>
      <p>“We go away, we take the rest that you need to rest up and we try to be as prepared as we can.</p>
      <p>“It’s just a bit of a coincidence that we don’t find ourselves with the right results afterwards.</p>
      <p>“We usually bounce back straight away so hopefully we can do that.</p>
      <p>“We’re massively disappointed, more in the performance than anything else. It’s as bad as we’ve been all season.</p>
      <p>“That or Blackburn first half, they’re two of our worst performances so far.</p>
      <p>“We’ll take any positives we can out of it and look to bounce back as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>“Luckily for us, games come quick in this league.”</p>
      <p>“We wanted to win today but it wasn’t to be.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t deserve it.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully we can put in a much better performance at Hull.</p>
      <p>“It’d be massive.”</p>
      <p>The game was decided on a set piece, Martyn Waghorn turning the ball home following a Tom Lawrence corner.</p>
      <p>PNE had a goal of their own from a set piece, Tom Barkhuizen finding the net; but the goal was ruled out for offside.</p>
      <p>There were questions asked of the decision and referee Tim Robinson admitted that even he wasn’t convinced.</p>
      <p>“The referee said to us that he’d have to have a look at it after because he wasn’t sure,” Browne explained.</p>
      <p>“The linesman gave it. It was Davo’s (Ben Davies’) shot.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know how missed it but he’s not a striker so we can’t think about it too much.</p>
      <p>“You just need to take chances like that.</p>
      <p>“Bringing another striker on might have freshened things up, up top, maybe changed the game, maybe not, who knows.</p>
      <p>“It’s disappointing to see him go off and hopefully he’ll be alright.</p>
      <p>“For all the possession we had second half, we didn’t penetrate enough.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t get in at goal or create any clear cut chances. It was more keeping it ticking over, switching the play.</p>
      <p>“We never looked like hurting them. We definitely got what we deserved.</p>
      <p>“We usually try to blow teams away right from the start but today we were right off it. “Definitely in that first half, I know it picked up in the second but it wasn’t our usual performance.</p>
      <p>“They’ve performed better on the night and deserved the three points.</p>
      <p>Browne started the day as skipper in the no.10 role and ended the game at right back, but that’s now a position that he feels comfortable in.</p>
      <p>“I can slot in there nicely, Darnell was on a booking and his game is quite aggressive.</p>
      <p>“The gaffer made that change, didn’t want to make the risk.</p>
      <p>“He brought Gally and Billy on and to be fair I think they did well, we just didn’t get ourselves into the right area to get a goal.”</p>
