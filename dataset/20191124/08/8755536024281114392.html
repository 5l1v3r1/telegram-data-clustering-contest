      <p>Fans thought that the star was referring to Michael, after the pair reportedly hit it off while both starring on Ex On The Beach.</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a>: “Ellie and Michael hit it off during filming on Ex On The Beach and now they’ve started dating.”</p>
      <p>“They were supposed to keep the relationship under wraps until the show had aired of course, but it seems they just couldn’t keep quiet.”</p>

      <p>However, Ellie claims that she is still very much single.</p>
      <p>In the comments section of the photo, her fellow Ex On The Beach star Sophie Kasaei commented, asking her who her “man” was.</p>
      <p>Ellie replied, “I couldn’t be anymore single just thought it was a funny caption.”</p>
