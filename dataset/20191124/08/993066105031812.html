      <p>Music festival TRNSMT is set to use an “interactive treasure hunt” to announce its line-up for next year.</p>
      <p>The Glasgow-based festival has said fans will be able to log on to its website on Tuesday at 4pm for the announcement.</p>
      <p>Music lovers will be presented with clues to who the acts will be for next year’s Glasgow Green festival, due to take place from July 10-12.</p>
      <p>Treasure hunters will be asked to solve clues on different locations and venues, with correct answers revealing the names to the acts who will headline next year.</p>
      <p>To take part, fans will have to go to www.trnsmtfest.com at 4pm on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Participants will then be in with a chance to win free tickets to the event if they share the correct answer on social media.</p>
      <p>The festival, due to take place for the fourth time next year, was seen as a replacement for T in the Park – which ended in 2016.</p>
      <p>Event organisers have also announced plans to hold a special “Black Friday” sale on tickets, which will give those who have signed up to the TRNSMT database a discount on three-day tickets to the festival for one week, before another tier of tickets are released in early December.</p>
      <p>Megastars such as Stormzy, Radiohead, Lewis Capaldi and the Killers have all performed at the Glasgow festival since it was first held in 2017.</p>
