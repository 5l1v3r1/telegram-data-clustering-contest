Before that, in different locations, they were nomads and immigrants.” Erdogan’s comments were directed at a U.S. audience following the U.S. House of Representatives vote to recognize the Armenian Genocide of 1915. The Turkish President vehemently denies that nearly 2 million Armenians, Assyrians, and Greeks were killed by the Ottoman Empire from 1914-1923. Erdogan has often lashed out in the past against states for commenting on the genocide or showing solidarity with the descendants of victims and survivors."/>
