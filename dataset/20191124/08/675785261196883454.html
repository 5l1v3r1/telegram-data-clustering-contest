      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:36:58+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:36</time> by <a rel="author">Nigel Nelson, Dan Bloom, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nigel-nelson/, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson will promise to freeze taxes for the next five years as he finally unveils the Tories' <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> manifesto today.</p>
      <p>The PM is to announce a triple tax lock on income tax, national insurance and VAT at the West Midlands launch of the Tory election manifesto.</p>
      <p>And in a pledge to Tory core voters, he'll vow to keep the triple lock on pensions, the winter fuel payment and concessionary bus passes if he stays in No10.</p>
      <p>But he will not give automatic free TV licences to over-75s - saying that will remain the BBC’s responsibility despite the Tories breaking a previous pledge to protect the benefit.</p>
      <p>The so-called 'tax lock' was an issue that dogged <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/theresa-may">Theresa May</a> in the 2017 election and is a bid by the Tories to take the fight to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> has also vowed to freeze income tax, NI and VAT - for the 95% of taxpayers who earn less than £80,000 a year.</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson will also introduce a ban on exporting plastic waste to poorer countries to stop it ending up in the oceans.</p>
      <p>The PM will say: “It’s time to turn the page from the dither, delay and division of recent years.</p>
      <p>“And to start a new chapter in the incredible history of this country.”</p>
      <p>In addition to not increasing NI, Mr Johnson plans to raise the threshold to £9,500 next year, which he says will mean a £100 tax cut for 31 million workers. And there will be £1billion for extra childcare on school premises after lessons and during holidays. There will be a pledge to spend £6.3billion making social housing more energy efficient.</p>
      <p>It was reported last night he will axe hospital car parking charges for some users, including blue badge disabled drivers, gravely ill patients and night staff who cannot use public transport.</p>
