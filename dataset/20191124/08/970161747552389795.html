      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> are tracking CSKA Moscow striker Fedor Chalov and are preparing a January bid if their transfer ban is lifted in December.</p>
      <p>The Blues will find out in the middle of next month if their appeal to UEFA is successful and they will be able to sign players again in January.</p>
      <p>If so, then they are likely to make a move for the Russia international, reports Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>21-year-old Chalov scored 15 league goals for CSKA last season and has netted five times in 16 matches this campaign.</p>
      <p>He has picked up two caps for Russia, but has most recently been playing for the Under-21 side, scoring against Serbia last Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Crystal Palace have been interested in Chalov in recent months and made bids for him over the summer, offering £23m on deadline day, but it was turned down.</p>
      <p>Chelsea would have to better that offer if they want to snap up the young striker in January, or in the summer, but CSKA are reportedly preparing for his exit over the winter.</p>
      <p>Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal have all also been linked with the Russian, but their interest appears to have cooled, with Chelsea now leading the race for his signature.</p>
      <p>However, any move will rest on the decision of their UEFA appeal, which is in the hands of the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>
      <p>On Chelsea’s transfer ban, manager Frank Lampard said: ‘Well, I’ll be very interested of course but it is a legal matter and I don’t know enough of the legals to even delve. But of course I’m interested because it’s obviously going to affect potentially what we can do in January or not.</p>
      <p>‘I think as Chelsea we will always look to improve in windows if we can, if we’re allowed to and if the players we might look at are better or we feel are worth adding to the squad.</p>
      <p>‘But, at the minute, I’m very happy with what I’ve got so I suppose that’s why, hopefully, fans are as well.’</p>
