      <p>Former ISRO Chairman <a href="https://indianexpress.com/?s=K+Kasturirangan">K Kasturirangan</a> has taken over as the new chairperson of the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/?s=NIIT+University+">NIIT University</a> (NU). The announcement was made at NIIT University’s 11th Annual Lecture at Neemrana on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Kasturirangan succeeds former Member of Parliament Karan Singh as the new chairperson of the not-for-profit university.</p>
      <p>A Padma Vibhushan recipient, Kasturirangan headed the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) from 1994 to 2003. He has also served as the Chancellor of Central University of Rajasthan.</p>
      <p>He chaired the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) Committee to draft the National Education Policy, and submitted it to the Union HRD minister in May 2019.</p>
      <p>“We are grateful to Dr Karan Singh for guiding NU in its formative years as the founding chairperson.
