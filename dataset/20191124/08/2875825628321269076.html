      <h1>Irish weather forecast: Unsettled weather to continue with dull rainy conditions</h1>
      <h2>However, we will see temperatures rise slightly tomorrow</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:31:30+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/edel-hughes/" target="_blank">Edel Hughes</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/met-eireann">Met Eireann</a> have forecast further "unsettled" conditions next week as an area of low pressure continues to dominate.</p>
      <p>The national forecaster warned we'll see dull and rainy weather with scattered showers throughout the week.</p>
      <p>However, the good news is that temperatures will be around normal after the prolonged cold snap and Friday looks set to be a dry day.</p>
      <p>Sunday morning will start dry but rather misty or foggy, slowly clearing this morning.</p>
      <p>Most areas will be dry but dull during the day, but rain will slowly move into Munster.</p>

      <p>A forecaster added: "Later in the evening, rain will move up into parts of Connacht and Leinster, along with freshening southeasterly breezes. Highest temperatures of 7C to 10C."</p>
      <p>Tonight will see some scattered outbreaks of rain, with some heavy bursts across southern counties and lows of 5C to 8C.</p>
      <p>Heading into Monday, it'll be "rather dull" again with scattered falls of rain and lingering fog in parts, especially across the west and northwest.</p>
      <p>There will be some long dry spells but it will remain overcast.</p>
