      <p><b>13</b> - Consecutive losses for Pakistan in Australia - this is the longest streak for any touring team in a country. The previous longest streak was nine by <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;home_or_away=2;opposition=2;orderby=start;spanmax2=20+Dec+1977;spanmin2=01+Jan+1948;spanval2=span;team=6;template=results;type=team;view=results">India</a> in Australia between 1948 and 1977, and <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;home_or_away=2;opposition=2;orderby=start;spanmax2=26+nov+2009;spanmin2=01+Jan+1999;spanval2=span;team=4;template=results;type=team;view=results">West Indies</a> in Australia between 2000 and 2009.</p>
      <p><b>18</b> - Wickets for the Australian pacers in this Test - <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?bowling_pacespin=1;class=1;filter=advanced;ground=209;groupby=match;orderby=wickets;spanmax1=24+Nov+2019;spanmin1=24+Nov+2009;spanval1=span;team=2;template=results;type=bowling">the most</a> in a Gabba Test since 2009. Mitchell Starc took seven wickets, Josh Hazlewood took six and Pat Cummins took five in the match.</p>
      <p><b>50.82</b> - Nathan Lyon's average against Pakistan - his <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/272279.html?class=1;opposition=7;template=results;type=bowling;view=innings">worst</a> against any country he has played against. Lyon does not have a five-wicket haul against Pakistan and has a strike rate of 92.7. Lyon's stats are not heavily influenced by his record in the UAE. His record at home against Pakistan is also poor - at home he has taken 13 wickets from eight innings against them, at an average 47.38.</p>
      <p><b>3</b> - Centurions for <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;ground=209;team=7;template=results;type=batting;view=innings">Pakistan</a> at the Gabba. Babar Azam joined Saeed Anwar and Asad Shafiq on the list. All three centuries were scored in the second innings, but in a losing cause.</p>
      <p><b>36.21</b> - Babar Azam's average at the end of his 22nd Test; he has 1340 runs at an average of 36.21 with two centuries. That's up from an average of 25.94 at the end of his first 10 Tests.</p>
      <p><b>95</b> - Highest score made by a Pakistan <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;host=2;keeper=1;orderby=batted_score;team=7;template=results;type=batting;view=innings">wicketkeeper</a> in Australia in Tests. Mohammad Rizwan's 95 went past the unbeaten 72 scored by Sarfaraz Ahmed in Sydney in 2017.</p>
