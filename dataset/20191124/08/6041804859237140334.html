      <p>In this age of Whatsapp, Tik Tok, and Social Media, things which are usually considered trivial by the Political Parties result in massive damage. IPAC used to make videos called Bye Bye Babu. Those cheeky videos made no sense but went viral due to the antics of the people in the videos.</p>
      <p>They helped public perception build against TDP and the result is for all of us to see. TDP did not unleash any such campaign on YSR Congress as yet but the ruling party’s eagerness to paint anything and everything with their party colors is doing more damage. The urge to paint every trivial thing in White, Green and Blue is being mocked by all and the videos of that are going viral on Social Media.</p>
      <p>Even though, it does not appear to be a trivial issue but is doing damage to YSR Congress. This is too early in <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/politics/now-jagan-government-to-sell-government-buildings/">Jagan’s</a> term. He can arrest the menace by controlling the over-enthusiasm of his party leaders or else, the damage will definitely have an impact.</p>
      <p>The other day, YSR Congress painted the podium of a Gandhi Statue in their party colors. After pointing it out, they whitewashed it and tried to prove the Opposition wrong. But then, they are taken back when TDP released the original video of the Podium painted in YSR Congress colors. Jagan better be wary than sorry.</p>
