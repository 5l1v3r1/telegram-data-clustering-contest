      <p>Cape Town - Scotland centre <b>Huw Jones</b> is reportedly eager to return to Cape Town and play for the <b>Stormers</b> in next year's Super Rugby competition.</p>
      <p>Jones has been on the books of Scottish club Glasgow Warriors since 2017, but according to <b><a href="https://www.netwerk24.com/Sport/Rugby/skotse-senter-huw-wil-weer-vir-stormers-speel-20191122">Netwerk24</a></b> he's had a fall-out with their coach Dave Rennie and is eager to move to the English Premiership.</p>
      <p>But before that, the 25-year-old would like to play another Super Rugby season for the Stormers, whom he represented between 2015 and 2017.</p>
      <p>Rennie was appointed new Australia coach earlier this week but will only leave his post at Glasgow in June.</p>
      <p>Edinburgh-born Jones caught the eye of Scotland selectors while playing his rugby in the Cape and made his Test debut against Japan in Tokyo in 2016.</p>
      <p>He has since played 23 Tests but was not picked for Scotland's Rugby World Cup squad.</p>
      <p>Whether the Stormers would be able to afford Jones' services is another question.</p>
      <p>There's no doubt, however, that the Cape franchise can do with another world-class centre, with all of Damian de Allende, JJ Engelbrecht, EW Viljoen and Dan Kriel having left.</p>
      <p>The centres remaining on their books include Dan du Plessis, Ruhan Nel, Rikus Pretorius, Michal Haznar and Matt Moore.</p>
