        <b>West Ham United are hoping to offload Carlos Sanchez in January ahead of the final months of his contract at the London Stadium, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10408697/west-ham-sell-carlos-sanchez/">according to a report from The Sun</a>.</b>

      <p>Sanchez has been an underwhelming signing for the Hammers. The former Aston Villa man arrived last summer but spent much of his first season with the Irons out injured.</p>

      <p>The Colombian has made four substitute appearances in the Premier League this term. And, despite featuring in Saturday’s clash with Tottenham, it appears that Manuel Pellegrini is ready to let him leave in just over a month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10408697/west-ham-sell-carlos-sanchez/">The Sun reports</a> that West Ham are willing to sell the 33-year-old for as little as £1 million. They would reportedly also be open to letting him leave on loan.</p>

      <p>The Sun adds that Sanchez – who is out of contract with the Hammers at the end of the season – would like to stay in England with his next move.</p>
      <h3>TBR View</h3>
      <p>It would arguably be unfair to be too harsh when assessing Sanchez’s time with the club. It has certainly not been a successful move. But given that West Ham do not appear to have spent a particularly large sum on him, it is probably right to suggest that it was a gamble that has simply not paid off.</p>
      <p>If the Hammers can get £1 million for Sanchez in January, it may be a smart deal. <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/epl/west-ham-united-f.c/payroll/">According to Spotrac</a>, he earns £50,000-a-week at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>The transfer fee may not prove to be a game-changing sum. But getting his wages off the books could be extremely beneficial if Pellegrini is hoping to strengthen his squad.</p>
