        <b>A covert raid by officers from the National Police Service at a house in Ruaka on Saturday, November 23, uncovered skimpily dressed underage girls <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/33592-difference-between-prostitution-and-commercial-sex-work">engaged in prostitution.</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>The report shared by<i> the Standard</i> revealed that the officers attached to Karuri DCI found 10 underage girls locked in the house, with some caught while still servicing their clients in bed.</p>
      <p>Posing as clients, the officers were granted passage into the 3-bedroomed apartment located on the 7th floor by a 44-year-old man, believed to be the pimp at the illegal establishment.</p>
      <p>They then identified themselves and ushered everyone to the police truck that was parked outside.</p>

      <p>Patrons who were found at the brothel were also arrested but later released, with some reportedly turned into witnesses against the owners of the establishment.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that the luxury apartments rented for Ksh 60,000 a month, had been catered for by a former Cabinet minister since the beginning of the year.</p>
      <p>Among the teenage girls rescued following the raid was a student who had disappeared from a secondary school in Kiambu two months ago.Â </p>
      <p>She went on to claim that she had been <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/43335-how-much-matiang-i-directive-cost-sex-workers">lured into the dark sex trade </a>world by her friend who promised that she would make a minimum of Ksh10,000 a day.</p>
      <p>Under the title of a masseuse, the teenager was taken to the apartment in Ruaka where she was introduced to prostitution and made between Ksh5,000 and KSh10,000 a day for her services - a sum which was later revised, with her operators pocketing 75 per cent while she got a paltry 25 per cent.</p>
      <p>She went on to reveal that on top of doing private house calls for clients who preferred the comfort of their own houses, she serviced at least 10 clients at the Ruaka apartments.</p>

      <p>The raid left residents of the seemingly normal apartment in shock, as officers walked out of the apartment with the skimpily dressed teenagers as well as loads of sex toys believed to be used by the minors during sex parties.</p>
      <p>Reports revealed that the pimp was charged with seven counts of traffic offences and released on a Ksh 1 million cash bail.</p>
