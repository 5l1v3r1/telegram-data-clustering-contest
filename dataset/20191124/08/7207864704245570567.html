      <h1>Japan Wants To Fly F-35s From Its Own Aircraft Carriers, Here Is How It Could Get Them</h1>
      <h2>The Japanese government in November 2018 announced that it plans to enhance its two <i>Izumo</i>-class helicopter carriers in order to support F-35B Lightning II stealth fighters.</h2>

      <p><b>Key point: </b>Transforming the two helicopter carriers into aircraft carriers won't be easy.</p>
      <p>The British company that built the Royal Navy’s two new <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>-class aircraft carriers wants to help Japan modify some of its own ships into carriers.</p>
      <p>The Japanese government in November 2018 announced that it plans to enhance its two <i>Izumo</i>-class helicopter carriers in order to support F-35B Lightning II stealth fighters.</p>
      <p>The announcement followed <u><a href="https://news.usni.org/2015/03/25/japan-commissions-largest-ship-since-world-war-ii">years of speculation</a></u> that began even before <i>Izumo </i>commissioned into service in 2015.</p>
      <p>“Since we are equipped with such vessels, it is desirable that we will use them for various purposes,” Japanese defense minister Takeshi Iwaya <u><a href="https://www.janes.com/article/84846/japan-considers-procuring-f-35b-for-its-izumo-class-helicopter-carriers">told</a></u> reporters. “We would like to advance our research and studies on this.”</p>
      <p>BAE Systems wants to do the work, Natasha Pheiffer, the company’s managing director in Asia, <u><a href="https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/bae-sees-hawk-upgrade-as-alternative-to-kls-lca-pl-458642/">told</a></u> Flight Global. “She feels that BAE is well placed to assist Tokyo with the integration of fixed-wing fighters aboard the two ships owing to its work on the U.K.’s <i>Queen Elizabeth-</i>class aircraft carriers, which will also operate the F-35B,” Flight Global noted.</p>
      <p>Tokyo plans to order another 100 F-35s to supplement the 42 stealth fighters it originally ordered in 2011. The first batch of Japanese F-35s are all A-models that require conventional runways. The new batch presumably would include some vertically-landing F-35B models for shipboard use.</p>
      <p>Transforming the two helicopter carriers into aircraft carriers won't be easy. The <i>Izumo</i>-class vessels are small for aviation ships. More vexingly, Japan hasn't operated fixed-wing aircraft from ships since World War II, and will need to train pilots, staff and maintainers for the unique challenges of carrier operations.</p>
      <p>But other countries have succeeded in operating fixed-wing planes from small aviation ships. Most notably, Italy. Australians are debating whether to modify their own small aviation vessels to carry F-35s.</p>
      <p>Japan's post-war constitution forbids offensive military operations. For decades, the country's leaders have interpreted the prohibition to mean the Japanese navy legally could not possess aircraft carriers.</p>
      <p>The Japanese fleet sidestepped the carrier-ban by acquiring what it called "helicopter destroyers" -- that is, surface warships with hangars and unusually large flight decks.</p>
      <p>The <i>Izumo </i>class stretched the credibility of the "helicopter destroyer" moniker. The type lacks major weaponry. Its flight deck extends from stem to stern. It's a carrier in everything but name. In practice, <i>Izumo </i>and sister ship <i>Kaga</i>, which commissioned in 2017, only have embarked helicopters.</p>
      <p>Each 814 feet long and displacing 27,000 tons of water while fully loaded, <i>Izumo </i>and <i>Kaga </i>are small for carriers. The U.S. Navy's supercarriers each are a thousand feet long and displace more than 100,000 tons. The Americans' amphibious assault ships -- which support helicopters, AV-8B Harrier jump jets and F-35s -- are around 850 feet long and displace 41,000 tons.</p>
      <p>But the Japanese ships aren't the smallest aviation ships. The dubious honor belongs to Thailand's <i>Chakri Naruebet</i>, which is just 600 feet long and displaces 11,500 tons but still managed to operate a handful of first-generation Harriers until the aging planes finally went into storage in 2006.</p>
      <p>In size and function, the <i>Izumo</i>s most likely will match Italy's flagship <i>Cavour</i>, an 800-feet-long amphibious assault ship that displaces 30,000 tons while fully loaded. <i>Cavour </i>typically embarks five Harriers alongside helicopters. Italy is buying new F-35Bs to replace its 16 Harriers.</p>
      <p>Lockheed Martin designed the F-35B to match the deck "footprint" of the Harrier. While an F-35 occupies the amount of deck space that a Harrier does, the stealth fighter requires more intensive maintenance -- and its engine exhaust is much hotter than the Harrier's is, requiring the launching ship to have a special, heat-resistant deck coating.</p>
      <p>Recoating the <i>Izumo</i>s' decks is a straightforward procedure. Potentially more difficult is reorganizing the ships' internal spaces to accommodate the crew, parts, fuel and weapons an F-35 detachment requires. That’s the kind of work BAE Systems presumably would take on if Japan were to hire it for the <i>Izumo </i>conversions.</p>
      <p>The modifications certainly are feasible, according to one Australian expert who studied the possibility of upgrading the Australian navy's <i>Canberra</i>-class assault ships in order to embark F-35s. A <i>Canberra </i>is 760 feet long and displaces 30,000 tons, making it roughly the same size as an <i>Izumo</i>.</p>
      <p>"For 30 years or more the U.K. and U.S., using AV-8Bs and Sea Harriers, have delivered significant operational effect from similar platforms," <u><a href="https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/lhd-and-stovl-an-engineers-view/">wrote</a></u> Steve George, a former Royal Navy engineering officer.</p>
      <p>"In my experience, the key challenge in delivering a viable maritime aviation capability wouldn’t be the equipment, but in re-generating the required naval-aviation expertise," George added.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for Japan, its navy enjoys a strong alliance with the U.S. Navy. As Tokyo begins preparing the <i>Izumo</i>s for F-35s, the Japanese fleet, in theory, could send pilots, staff and crew to train alongside their American counterparts who are already operating F-35s from ships.</p>
