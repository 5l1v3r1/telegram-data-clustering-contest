      <p>Pop superstar Ed Sheeran made a surprise visit to Devon yesterday - to watch his wife play hockey at the University of Exeter.</p>
      <p>Rumours started to spread the singer was at the Streatham campus on Saturday to support Cherry Seaborn. Later a number of students took to social media to confirm they had seen him.</p>
      <p>Beth, a second year student, bumped into Ed as they left the gym this afternoon, according to <a href="https://thetab.com/uk/exeter/2019/11/23/ed-sheeran-spotted-on-exeter-uni-campus-45114?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">The Exeter Tab.</a></p>
      <p>She said: "He was watching the girls hockey match as his wife was playing for the team 'Pies' I think."</p>
      <p>She added: "I didn't speak to him really, just asked for a pic as he was walking away."</p>

      <p>Later Isca Hockey Club responded to a tweet to say they had noticed they had a multi-millionaire watching them play - but they kept their manners and didn't pester him.</p>
      <p>Cherry's team Harleston Magpies enjoyed a 3-0 win over Isca in Division One of the Investec Women's Hockey League.</p>
      <p>Ed and Exeter go back a long way, although it isn't all happy memories.</p>
      <p>The singer has confessed the city was the site of his worst ever gig.</p>
      <p>The singer song-writer <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/ed-sheeran-returns-exeter-worst-2334241">told Radio X</a> : "I was getting paid 50 quid for this gig and it was an 80 quid train ticket, and I thought ' I'm already 30 quid down but it's fine. I'll get down there and sell some of my CDs from my backpack.</p>

      <p>"Gets to eight, I'm meant to be going on at 8.30 No oneâ€™s there. My train's at like 10. I was like 'can I push it back?'</p>
      <p>"And they were like 'push it back to nine'. No one was there. Pushed it back to 9.30. No one was there. They were like 'you just have to play'.</p>
      <p>"So I played to no one, missed my train, didn't sell any CDs, then I slept on the little bench at the train station till 5(am)."</p>
      <p>He added: "That was about two months before I broke. That was the lowest of the low."</p>
