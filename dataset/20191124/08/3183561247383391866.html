      <p>As we patiently refresh every single website in the world waiting for that sweet <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/theres-more-to-the-mandalorians-concept-art-than-baby-yoda">Baby Yoda merch</a> from <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/pedro-pascal-awkwardly-said-the-mandalorians-real-name-in-an-interview"><i>The Mandalorian</i></a>, we’re excited to exclusively reveal <i>another</i> toy based on a new character introduced in the series: the Heavy Infantry Mandalorian, as part of Hasbro’s popular Black Series line.</p>
      <p>This character was introduced in <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/the-third-episode-of-the-mandalorian-changed-everything">Episode III of the show</a>, “The Sin,” so if you haven’t seen it yet and don’t want to know more, stop here.</p>

      <p>The Heavy Infantry Mandalorian appears twice in “The Sin.” First, he’s there to mess with the main character over his beskar and drop some Mandalorian history facts. Later, he’s there to save the Mandalorian from an angry mob. It’s at that point we see him wielding a massive Gatling gun-type weapon, which felt a little <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/04/were-in-love-with-this-chirrut-and-baze-rogue-one-poster">Baze Malbus-inspired</a>.</p>
      <p>The credits list the character as “Paz Vizla,” which is interesting considering the voice coming from the character is <i>Mandalorian</i> writer and <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/a-new-star-wars-holiday-special-will-happen-if-jon-favreau-has-his-way">creator Jon Favreau</a>. Favreau also voiced a Mandalorian character named Pre Vizsla on <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/clone-wars-once-again-proves-that-its-the-ideal-venue-f-30760887"><i>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</i></a>, and while the spellings are different, it feels a little too close to be a coincidence, right? We’ll see how that plays out.</p>
      <p>Anyway, now that you know about the character, let’s see the toy. You’re here for the toy and the toy you shall have. Like. Now. Really.</p>

      <p>Heavy! Infantry! Mandalorian! Ta-Da!</p>
      <p>And while we still don’t know when or if a <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/theres-more-to-the-mandalorians-concept-art-than-baby-yoda">Baby Yoda</a> is coming from Hasbro, the fact <i>this</i> semi-secretive character could be released so soon is certainly a good sign for that one.</p>
      <p>We’ll have much more on <i>The Mandalorian</i> next week. Check out some of our recent coverage below.</p>
