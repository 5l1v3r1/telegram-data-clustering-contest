      <h1>Tinashe &amp; G-Eazy Drop "So Much Better" Visual</h1>
      <h2>A cut off her newest studio album, ‘Songs for You.’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:46:12+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:46</time> by <a rel="author">Sophie Caraan</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/tinashe">Tinashe</a> has shared a music video for the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/g-eazy">G-Eazy</a>-assisted track “So Much Better,” taken from her newest studio album <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/tinashe-songs-for-you-album-stream">Songs for You</a></i>. Directed by Mynxii White, the hazy yet sultry visual sees Tinashe dressed in majestic ensembles as she casually examines a Dobermann’s teeth, plays with a snake that’s on her fingers (and later on, across her face) and sets roses on fire. As the songstress glamorously manages to stay calm in these situations, G-Eazy rides in on a Ferrari and watches Tinashe across his headlights.</p>
