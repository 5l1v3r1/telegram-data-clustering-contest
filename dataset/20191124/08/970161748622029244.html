      <p>Luis Ortiz slammed the decision of the referee to stop his fight with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/deontay-wilder/">Deontay Wilder</a> during the seventh round of their rematch in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>Wilder knocked Ortiz down with an explosive right hand and the Cuban was visibly struggling to get back to his feet and beat the count.</p>
      <p>Kenny Bayless was the referee for the fight and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/deontay-wilder-pulls-off-stunning-comeback-scorecards-revealed-luis-ortiz-rematch-11208296/">waved off the contest during the count</a>, clearly fearing for Ortiz’s safety after a painful knockdown.</p>
      <p>Speaking through a translator, Ortiz expressed his anger at the stoppage in the post-fight press conference: ‘Yes he was in great shape both physically and mentally. He was prepared to take this fight wherever it went – knockout or decision.</p>

      <p>‘His only gripe is he feels being a championship fight, a grudge match, the referee probably could have just let it go on.</p>

      <p>‘There was eight seconds left. Let’s see what happens and give him the benefit of the doubt. It is what it is now.</p>
      <p>‘But, as you see he’s very upset that didn’t happen. He’s a fighter, he wants to fight.’</p>
      <p>Wilder had no complaints about the stoppage and praised Bayless for his officiating.</p>
      <p>‘The way he fell and his body language, I thought he can’t get up,’ Wilder said of the knockdown.</p>

      <p>‘But I looked back again to make sure he wasn’t getting up. I think the referee did a great job stopping that fight.</p>
      <p>‘If we had him in the Fury fight we wouldn’t be talking about (Tyson) Fury right now.’</p>
      <p>Wilder is now set to fight Tyson Fury next in their hugely-anticipated rematch, which is expected to take place 22 February.</p>
