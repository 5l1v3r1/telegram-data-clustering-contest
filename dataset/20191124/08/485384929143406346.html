      <h1>Sisters believed to be Australia's oldest living triplets turn 90</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:51:49+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/zalika-rizmal/9575774" target="_blank">Zalika Rizmal</a></address>
      <p>When you ask triplets Helen, Judy and Barbara the secret to a long life, they'll tell you it's happiness, kindness, family and exercise.</p>
      <h3>Key points:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Celebrating their 90th birthday, the sisters said they had always shared a "special connection"</li>
        <li>The triplets still play golf and bridge and are active in their community</li>
        <li>The record for oldest triplets used to be held by a US family</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But when pushed, they admitted a glass of VB had also been a part of their daily routine for much of their 90 years.</p>
      <p>The sisters, thought to be the oldest living triplets in Australia, celebrated their milestone birthday on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Born two-and-a-half months premature on November 23, 1929, they were not expected to survive — and were quite a surprise to their parents Ivy and Tom Houlihan, who were only expecting one baby.</p>
      <p>It was so much of a shock, Helen, Judy and Barbara Houlihan were not given second names.</p>

      <p>The family already had two young girls, and the arrival of an additional three meant they struggled financially.</p>

      <p>But decades later, the sisters laughed and smiled as they looked back on their childhood.</p>
      <blockquote>"We've had a wonderful life, we really have," Helen Smith<b> </b>said.</blockquote>
      <p>"We giggled our way through everything," Barbara Dodd<b> </b>chimed in.</p>
      <p>"We did everything together," the trio said in unison.</p>
      <p>The inseparable sisters became known as the Houlihan triplets, a moniker that followed them even after they got married — Helen to John Smith, Barbara to Bill Dodd and Judy to Peter Beech.</p>

      <p>The three began their working life in the city working at the GPO on trunk lines training.</p>
      <p>The fraternal triplets said they had always shared a "special connection".</p>
      <p>Even as adults, they said they would spend evenings together and speak on the phone nearly every day.</p>

      <p>Judy's daughter, Gillian Beech, said her mother and aunts played tennis for many years and still play golf.</p>
      <p>"They don't get out on the course now as much as they would like to but spend a lot of there time there doing lunches and playing bridge with their friends," she said.</p>
      <p>"They love a punt on the horses and love their daily VB."</p>

      <p>Between the three of them, they now have 35 offspring, including children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</p>
      <p>They say their fondest memories are of their family.</p>
      <p>"Just all being together … and laughter," Ms Smith said.</p>
      <p>Although records for age are self-reported, the Houlihan triplets could be the oldest in Australia, and maybe even the world.</p>
      <p>The world's oldest recorded triplets <a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/obituaries/kirchner-longest-living-triplets-1.32367897">lived to 95 years old in the US</a>.</p>
      <p>Margaret, Mary and Muriel Beal are thought to be Britain's oldest living triplets and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/sisters-believed-britains-oldest-living-15449271">celebrated their 83rd birthday together in the England this year</a>.</p>
      <p>In Australia, 79-year-old Florence Welsh, Dorothy Murphy and Betsy Audino are <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2015/04/27/4224655.htm">thought to be the oldest living identical triplets</a>.</p>
