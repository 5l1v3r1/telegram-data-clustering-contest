      <h2>Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said top Labour ministers are likely to pick a side and campaign on it in a second Brexit referendum after the 2019 general election - and those people include himself</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:52:14+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:52</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Labour will let top ministers campaign against Brexit next year despite leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> staying neutral, a top ally confirmed today.</p>
      <p>Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said while the leader will be an "honest broker" in a second referendum, other ministers will be able to campaign for or against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> "on the basis of their judgement".</p>
      <p>It comes after several top allies to the Labour leader including Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry pushed for Remain to be on the ballot paper.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-jeremy-corbyn-reveals-hell-20939409">confirmed on Friday night</a> that he would stay neutral as Prime Minister in a second Brexit referendum so he could fairly carry out the result.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader hopes to renegotiate a withdrawal deal within three months, then put it to voters within six months of becoming Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>But he said he would refuse to take sides between backing his own pact or Remain in a campaign.</p>

      <p>Speaking in a live BBC Question Time leaders’ special, he said: "My role and the role of our government will be to ensure that that referendum is held in a fair atmosphere and we will abide by the result of it.</p>
      <p>"And I will adopt, as prime minister, if I am at the time, a neutral stance so that I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring communities and country together rather than continuing an endless debate about the EU and Brexit."</p>
      <p>The Mirror learned on Friday that shadow ministers - who'll become Cabinet ministers if Labour wins - were expected to be allowed to campaign freely.</p>

      <p>And today, Mr McDonnell confirmed to Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday: "Members of the shadow cabinet, members of the government at that time, will be able to campaign.</p>
      <p>"And I expect that as Harold Wilson did [in the 1975 referendum], individual members of the party and the shadow cabinet and the Cabinet then, will be able to campaign on the basis of their judgement."</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell indicated he personally will not stay neutral - but said he must wait to see the details of a Labour deal before picking a side.</p>
      <p>He added: "I've said up until now I was in the negotiations with the Conservatives for six weeks and I couldn't see a deal even emerging then that could beat Remain.</p>
      <p>"But let's see what we can negotiate.</p>
      <p>"Whatever we do we've got to we've got to arrive at a situation where jobs and the economy will be protected. Jeremy's role will be an honest broker."</p>
