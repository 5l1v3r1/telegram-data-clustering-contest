      <h1>Bride with rare terminal cancer had arm amputated to buy time to marry man of her dreams</h1>
      <h2>Doctors have given Shannon Lynch just a year to live because she has untreatable tumours in her lungs after a rare cancer spread there</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Penketh-King, Kelly-Ann Mills, Amardeep Bassey</a></address>
      <p>A 21-year-old woman with terminal cancer has told how she met and married the man of her dreams after having her right arm amputated to give her a chance to live longer.</p>
      <p>Shannon Lynch, 21, from Edenbridge, Kent, was first diagnosed with a rare cancer in her elbow at the age of 15.</p>
      <p>While doctors initially thought the lump in her arm might be down to “tennis elbow”, it grew bigger and a month later she was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma - a rare type of cancer that affects soft tissues.</p>
      <p>Shannon battled with the cancer in her elbow for six years and had her arm amputated in 2017 to stem the progress of the disease.</p>
      <p>A year later in December 2018 Shannon joined her brother to play video games on Xbox Live when she got chatting to his friend Ashley.</p>
      <p>The pair started talking every day on the gaming platform and just a few weeks later, they met in person and it was love at first sight.</p>
      <p>Shannon said: "I joined an Xbox Live party with my brother and Ash was in the group. Something just clicked between us and then we started chatting loads.</p>
      <p>"I already knew so much about him from my brother, we just bonded almost instantly.</p>
      <p>"We met up for a drink at Costa Coffee and I just fell for him immediately."</p>
      <h3>'My whole world turned upside down'</h3>
      <p>Ashley and Shannon officially started dating in January 2019, but after a few months of romance, disaster struck.</p>
      <p>Shannon was taken into hospital with a kidney infection in May 2019, but as the kidney treatment worked, she suddenly had extreme chest pain.</p>
      <p>Taken for a CT scan, doctors saw that Shannon's lungs were filling with blood, caused by three tumours inside her lungs.</p>
      <p>Doctors told Shannon that her cancer had returned and this time it was incurable.</p>
      <p>In July 2019, Shannon was devastated to hear that she had less than a year to live.</p>
      <p>Shannon said: "My whole world turned upside down. I was terrified as I know how hard it is to treat lung cancers.</p>
      <p>"When they told me I had less than a year to live, I was shocked as I thought I would have longer than that.</p>
      <p>"The doctors said that chemotherapy would give me extra time here, but it wouldn't save me, which was heartbreaking to hear.</p>
      <p>"They said I had anywhere from a few months to a year, but I'm still fighting after the few months so I am pleased to have made it to now."</p>
      <p>Shannon's devastating diagnosis only brought the couple closer, as Ashley took on the role of being his girlfriend's carer.</p>
      <p>A month after they found out that Shannon would die in the next year, Ashley surprised her with a ring.</p>
      <p>Shannon said: "We were at home when Ashley came over to me with one hand hidden behind his back.</p>
      <p>"He said that he wanted to be with me for the rest of his life and then he got down on one knee and asked me if I wanted to marry him.</p>
      <p>"I said yes and was desperately trying not to cry - I couldn't believe it, I was just so excited for our future together."</p>
      <p>Ashley said: "What made me fall for Shannon was that she was so open and also because she had the cutest laugh in the world.</p>
      <p>"Over time, the more I learned about her, the more I fell in love.</p>
      <p>"I proposed because I honestly thought it was time - from the first day I met her, I wanted to marry her."</p>
      <h3>'Our wedding was beautiful'</h3>
      <p>The young couple tied the knot on 26 October 2019 in front of 100 friends and family members at their local church.</p>
      <p>Shannon held a bouquet of pink flowers for the service, and their wedding reception was adorned with pink and blue decorations.</p>
      <p>The brave bride opted to wear a wig for her wedding service but removed the brunette do for the reception.</p>
      <p>Shannon said: "Our wedding was beautiful, the cake was the best I've ever tasted and the decorations were so lovely.</p>
      <p>"Ashley and I were both really nervous, but as soon as we were together, everything felt okay again.</p>
      <p>"The wedding just felt so surreal, and I wouldn't have changed it in any way.</p>
      <p>"I wore a wig for the service as I wanted some nice pictures of me with hair in my wedding dress, but it was just too itchy to wear at the reception.</p>
      <p>"When they pronounced us man and wife, I felt so extremely happy and excited for mine and Ash's future."</p>
      <p>Since the wedding, Shannon and Ashley have happily settled into married life and are making the most of the short time they have together.</p>
      <p>Shannon is currently going through chemotherapy to extend her time with her new husband and the pair are focusing on enjoying every day.</p>

      <p>Shannon said: "I am happy for all the time I get with my husband, my family and my friends.</p>
      <p>"Ashley and I haven't really spoken about the future as we would rather forget that I'm going to die soon and think about it when I get to that stage.</p>
      <p>"It is difficult for Ashley but he understands and is grateful for all the time we do get together.</p>
      <p>"He told me that he is terrified that every morning he wakes up, I could have gone in the night.</p>
      <p>"I've come to terms with it now - whatever happens, happens. I can't choose how long I can live for, I'm just grateful for the time I do get."</p>
      <p>Ashley said: "I'm not gonna try and hide from the fact that I will lose her to something that I have no control over.</p>
      <p>"It's the hardest thing I have to face in my life and every time I think about it, I almost cry.</p>
      <p>"In all honesty, I am trying to make the best memories I can with Shannon. I want to make her dreams come true."</p>
