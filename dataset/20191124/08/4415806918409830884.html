      <p>A number of the migrants found on a ship to Rosslare last Thursday have left a Dublin direct provision centre.</p>
      <p>Gardaí have confirmed that most of the migrants are no longer in the care of the State.</p>
      <p>The group included 15 adults and one juvenile. According to gardaí, all of them sought international protection which is effectively seeking refugee status. Under that system, they were offered accommodation in a Dublin direct provision centre.</p>
      <p>However, the process means they were not detained and all of them are free to leave their accommodation.</p>
      <p>Gardaí have confirmed the 16th member of the group, however, is a juvenile who has now been taken into the care of the child and family agency, Tusla.</p>
      <p>They were part of a group of Kurdish males who were discovered in a container on a Stena Line ship from Cherbourg to Rosslare.</p>
      <p>They spent up to 12 hours in the trailer of an articulated tractor unit before being discovered at Rosslare port on Thursday</p>
