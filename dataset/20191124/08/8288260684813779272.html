      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:37:36+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:37</time> by <a rel="author">Elliot Jackson, Josh Murray</a></address>
      <p>Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy has sung the praises of Joao Moutinho after his stunning goal set Wolverhampton Wanderers on their way to victory over Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese star - who followed up the Vitality Stadium triumph by <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-news-joao-moutinho-contract-17307122">signing a new contract with Wolves</a> - opened the scoring on Saturday by curling home a superb free-kick.</p>
      <p>Raul Jimenez's 14th goal of the campaign doubled the lead for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-news-nuno-moutinho-adama-17306666">Nuno Espirito Santo's men,</a> before Simon Francis was sent off for the hosts.</p>
      <p>Steve Cook ensured it would be a tense finish when his deflected header reduced the arrears for the 10-man Cherries - but <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> held on for their fourth League win of the campaign.</p>

      <p>It owed much to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/joao-moutinho">Moutinho's</a> brilliant first goal of the League campaign - and he has started all but one of their 13 matches.</p>
      <p>That led to plenty of praise from Murphy on Match of the Day, who highlighted the experienced man's importance to Nuno's side.</p>
      <p>"You have to admire him and I love watching him play," he said.</p>
      <p>"He can create moments of magic like this. They have a few players with that extra bit of quality, hence the fact they’re sat in fifth but look at that for a strike.</p>
      <p>"This is what you like to see, creative midfielder, switches off, Wilson, and Jimenez with his 14th goal of the season.</p>
      <p>"He (Moutinho) has the ability to open you up anywhere on the pitch.</p>
      <p>"I know Bournemouth went down to 10 men, but you can't give him this time on the ball because he’ll just keep spraying the play.</p>
      <p>“Also, a player of his age it shows how well he looks after himself, he’s been involved in every game this season.</p>
      <p>"He just gives them that extra bit of quality we were talking about. Wolves deserve a lot of credit because they started the season really poorly and they’ve really gone on a good run.”</p>
