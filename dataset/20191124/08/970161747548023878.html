      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! bosses have ramped up security after a man was found dead in the surrounding area.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, police in New South Wales launched a manhunt to find the killer after a 50-year-old was discovered in Jack Evans Boat Harbour, Tweed Heads, an hour from where the ITV reality show is filmed in Murwillumbah.</p>
      <p>‘The celebs are being watched 24 hours a day, seven days a week by a team of staff and our security measures are incredibly tight,’ an insider said.</p>
      <p>They continued to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10409277/im-a-celeb-security-hunt-killer/">The Sun</a>: ‘So there is zero chance of anyone sneaking into camp.</p>
      <p>‘But of course, it is very unsettling to know that there is someone out there, running from the police, who has committed such a horrible crime.’</p>

      <p>‘The movements and the history of the victim is something that we are in the early stages of establishing,’ he told <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-22/tweed-heads-body-found-in-sleeping-bag/11730258">ABC</a>.</p>
      <p>‘We are very keen to speak to any person that was in Jack Evans Boat Harbour yesterday evening and this morning who might have seen something or know anything about this.</p>
      <p>‘We do want to establish where this man is from and how he came to be in the state he is in now.’</p>
      <p>The current series of I’m A Celebrity kicked off last week with a number of<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-2019-line-up-suits-up-for-new-series-in-official-photos-11080048/"> impressive names on the line-up</a>, including Caitlyn Jenner and Nadine Coyle.</p>
      <p>Last night’s episode saw all 12 contestants undertake a gruesome Bushtucker Trial with one group having to endure live critters being dropped on their heads while the other group had to<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/im-celebrity-use-live-bugs-bushtucker-trial-stars-hold-spiders-mouths-despite-controversial-ban-11206966/"> hold live bugs in their mouths for 60 seconds</a>.</p>
      <p>During the trial, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/im-a-celebrity-recap-caitlyn-jenner-gagged-on-a-cows-eye-while-cliff-parisis-luxury-item-was-the-thing-best-ever-11207342/">Caitlyn gagged on a cow’s eye</a> but managed to pull through and Adele Roberts and Nadine had to chomp down on cow anus.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the campmates were finally given their luxury items and it was revealed that former EastEnders star Cliff Parisi<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/im-celebritys-cliff-parisi-brings-christmas-tree-luxury-item-fans-absolutely-loving-11207662/"> had brought with him a Christmas tree</a> for a little bit of festive cheer.</p>
