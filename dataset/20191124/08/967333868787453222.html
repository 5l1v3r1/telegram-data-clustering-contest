      <p>​In addition to deleting the 2NE1 profile page, it also became known that one of the members of the group, Dara, who held the position of PR director at YG, left her position after the disbandment of the group, but resigned her contract as a solo artist.</p>
      <p>Dara confirmed this in a Twitter thread in a reply to a fan who was asking whether she was still working at YG as a public relations director. The singer replied herself from her official account that it is not true.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the former leader of the band, CL, officially parted ways with YG Entertainment and made her own YouTube channel with Dara's support on Instagram, asking fans to subscribe.</p>
