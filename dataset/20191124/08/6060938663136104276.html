After wrapping up <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Subhash-Ghai">Subhash Ghai</a>'s sports drama 'Vijeta' now the actress has kick-started the shooting of her upcoming sequel 'Dagdi Chawl 2'. Today, the 'Dagdi Chawl' actress took to her Instagram stories to share a few pictures of the first-day shoot.</p>

      <p>On Navami, the residents of Dagdi Chawl were thrilled when they saw a familiar persona walk into their premises. Known to be a stronghold of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arun-Gawli">Arun Gawli</a> aka Daddy, the people were almost sure that they saw Daddy walk into Dagdi Chawl. The grand entry, inimitable style, and a huge convoy further raised the excitement. Soon, it was revealed that the person wasn't Gawli, but actor Makarand Deshpande. Mac, as Deshpande is affectionately called, was at the chawl to perform the Devi puja on Navami.</p>
      <p>The Marathi cinema's popular star, Makarand Deshpande had earned a lot of accolades for his portrayal of Daddy in 'Dagdi Chawl' and he is now all set to step into the shoes of the character for the upcoming sequel ‘Dagdi Chawl 2'.</p>
      <p>Produced under the banner of Sangeeta Ahir Moviez, the film has been produced by Sangeeta Ahir and Krrish Ahir and the shoot will be on floor soon. The film also reunites <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ankush-Chaudhari">Ankush Chaudhari</a> and Pooja Sawant in lead roles.</p>
