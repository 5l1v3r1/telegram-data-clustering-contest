      <h1>Pep Clotet press conference: Every word on Trueman, Clarke-Salter and Montero</h1>
      <h2>Birmingham City news | Pep Clotet's full transcript after Birmingham City's 1-1 draw with Huddersfield Town</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Pep Clotet was pleased with the character of his team - and Connal Trueman as the young goalkeeper played an important part in Birmingham City’s 1-1 draw at Huddersfield Town.</p>
      <p>They had to come from behind to claim it, though, after Frazier Campbell put the hosts ahead in the 55th minute.</p>
      <p>Lukas Jutkiewicz was on hand to deflect home Marc Roberts’ header with 12 minutes to go, which gave Clotet a point he felt his team merited.</p>
      <h3>Match analysis</h3>
      <p>"It was a hard fought point, you knew it was going to be very difficult, they are in good form at home, we knew they would press us a lot.</p>
      <p>"We knew today we would have to be a bit more patient with the ball, try to dominate possession when it was very difficult to get possession.</p>
      <p>"We knew that if we managed to break this press the game would open up a little bit more in wide areas.</p>
      <p>"That’s why we went a little bit wider today.</p>

      <p>"I think the effort was there, despite the set-back of them scoring first because it looked like it was going to be a game of the first one who scores can take the points.</p>
      <p>"The team kept believing and although we had a little spell where we were nervous, obviously going away from home and everything is a little bit more difficult, I think the team managed the game superbly.</p>
      <p>"The players coming off the bench all made a big impact."</p>
      <h3>Connal Trueman</h3>
      <p>"I am very happy for him because it’s his debut this season - he played a few games last season - but he put his head down and worked for a year-and-a-half, we thought he deserved that chance.</p>
      <p>"It’s up to him to take it, not only did he save important chances but at the same time he showed that he had the character as well. He helped us a lot from the back.</p>
      <p>"I am very pleased for him because it really comes from his own work."</p>

      <h3>Jake Clarke-Salter</h3>
      <p>"There is no doubting the quality of Jake, he has already showed at international level and playing aboard but that position is never easy because a mistake in there is always a difficult one to overcome.</p>
      <p>"But he is growing into his own game and the Championship is difficult, especially with today how physical Huddersfield would be. I think he managed.</p>
      <p>"He is in a position where he needs to use his pace because that gave him a little bit of an edge with the strikers. It’s not easy for a young player to perform in the Championship."</p>
      <h3>Jefferson Montero's bright cameo....</h3>
      <p>"He was a handful when he came on because he has that ability to beat defenders one-v-one. He got us that foul for the goal and he was a constant threat on the wing.</p>
      <p>"It’s still a bit early because now we have Bela and Josh [McEachran] featuring, sometimes I would like that we would be two months further down the road and everyone is used to everything.</p>
      <p>"But that’s how we are, we have said we are a work in progress, we are growing and the fact we are getting results away from home always leaves you wanting more."</p>

      <h3>Set piece success</h3>
      <p>"The whole team works a lot on it. It was a massive strength for us last season, it got us 27 goals last season, all the set plays including throws and free kicks. It’s always been a massive part of Birmingham City.</p>
      <p>"And this season as well, it’s very important for us because today if we didn’t find the perfect chance to score a goal a set-piece can always unlock it and today it was very, very welcome."</p>
