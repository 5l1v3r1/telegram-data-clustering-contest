      <h1>Joe Biden Forced To Defend His Son, Hunter Biden, After DNA Test Results Confirmed He Is The Father Of Lunden Alexis Roberts’ Baby</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T08:57:28+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 08:57</time> by <a rel="author">Dylan Fisher</a></address>
      <p>Recent reports indicate that Hunter Biden has one more child than he knew of. As DNA test results confirmed, Hunter is now the father of four children, as he has three daughters from his first marriage to Kathleen Buhle.</p>
      <p>In May 2018, the second son of former Vice President Joe Biden agreed to a DNA test to prove that he had not had sexual relationships with 28-year-old Lunden Alexis Roberts, and he was not the father of her child.</p>
      <p>49-year-old Hunter decided to challenge the DNA test results when Roberts filed a petition for paternity and claimed she had the right to child support just two weeks after his marriage to Melissa Cohen.</p>
      <p>The unidentified child was born in August 2018, when at the time, Biden was still romantically involved with the widow of his late brother Beau, Hallie Biden.</p>
      <p>Biden started dating his former sister-in-law in 2016, and the relationship continued until April 2019. Just months later, Hunter married the South African filmmaker, Melissa Cohen. So apparently, Biden cheated on his brother’s widow with Roberts.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Roberts was determined to show once and for all who the biological father of her kid is, and to ensure that her child, who is now 14 months old, received some kind of financial support and health insurance.</p>
      <p>According to Roberts’ motion, she has requested that information regarding her baby remain secluded from the public and wanted for the child to receive the protection by the United States Secret Service that is granted to the other members of the Biden family due to Joe Biden’s political status.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Barack Obama’s VP has been forced to defend his troubled son and the recent scandals. Biden recently spoke to Don Lemon and bashed Lindsey Graham, who has asked for an investigation.</p>
      <p>The presidential candidate said: “They’re asking Lindsey Graham. They have him under their thumb right now. They know he knows if he comes out against Trump, he’s got a real tough road for reelection. He knows me. He knows my son. He knows there’s nothing to this.”</p>
      <p>The former Delaware senator added: “Lindsey is about to go down in a way that I think he’s going to regret his whole life. Lindsey… I’m just embarrassed by what you’re doing — for you — I mean, my Lord.”</p>
      <p>Biden is leading the polls and some experts say he might the favorite for the Democratic nomination for president.</p>
