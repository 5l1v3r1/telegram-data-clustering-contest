      <p>Here's every word <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno</a> said after the win at the Vitality Stadium:</p>
      <h3>Reflections on the game</h3>
      <p>“I think it was a good game, honestly. I think first half we played very good, we played really, really well.</p>
      <p>“Balanced, creating chances, always with good possession, organised. I think we achieved the advantage.</p>
      <p>“Then with one man less, until the end of the first half we managed well. In the second half, we knew that Bournemouth are a very good team. Very good players, Eddie [Howe] reacted and created problems. We know that the game was dangerous it was about getting the third goal, but at the same time keeping the balance.</p>
      <p>“I think we performed well and I’m happy with the boys, because the first half should be our reference for how we want to proceed and to keep on growing and improving.”</p>

      <h3>Defensive resilience</h3>
      <p>“Of course, Bournemouth is a very good team, it is very difficult to play here at Vitality Stadium. They keep the ball, they are patient, they tried to find spaces and they have very good players that can cause you problems.</p>
      <p>“The team conceded a set piece, we have to look at that. It is a moment we must be very focused.”</p>
      <h4>Joao Moutinho</h4>
      <p>“I think a lot of players performed very well. As a team we played very, very, very good.</p>
      <p>“It is about that, when you come back from international break, knowing that all the players have been around the world. It is about getting together, keeping to your task and trying to make the things we’ve been doing all the time and trying to reproduce on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“Joao is an important player because he has the experience to know at each moment what the game requires.”</p>

      <h3>Adama Traore</h3>
      <p>"He's a very important player, like all the players. The idea is to create versatile players because we have a small squad. Adama is doing well but I insist he has a lot of things to improve.</p>
      <p>"It is exceptional the way he helps the team, not only offensively but also defensively in the way he helps the team and presses to win balls. It's amazing."</p>
