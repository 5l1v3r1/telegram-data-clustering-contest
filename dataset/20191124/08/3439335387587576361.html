      <p>TUSCALOOSA, Ala. &gt;&gt; Tua Tagovailoa watched from a cart as his Alabama teammates treated him to a dominant performance against a badly outclassed opponent.</p>
      <p>Mac Jones passed for 275 yards and three touchdowns in little more than a half and No. 5 Alabama began life without Tagovailoa with a 66-3 romp Saturday over Western Carolina of the Football Championship Subdivision.</p>
      <p>With Tagovailoa watching much of the game from behind the bench, the Crimson Tide (10-1) put on a one-sided show against the Catamounts (3-9). The star quarterback, who had hip surgery on Monday, was cheered as he was driven toward the sideline before the game. He didn’t have to give much of a pep talk.</p>
      <p>“Just his presence,” Tide wide receiver Jaylen Waddle said. “Just knowing what he meant to the team. That was enough. He didn’t have to say much.”</p>
      <p>Alabama is fifth in the College Football Playoff rankings and hoping to somehow make the field despite failing to win the SEC West — and losing its biggest star.</p>
      <p>But this one was about taking care of business after an emotional week, not impressing the selection committee.</p>
      <p>“It’s not easy to overcome something like that, losing a great leader,” said Jones, who completed 10 of 12 passes in his second career start. “But I think we’re built for that. We train every day for the whole year mentally and physically. It’s really mental toughness and learning how to rebound and respond to adversity.”</p>
      <p>Alabama forced five turnovers, including Xavier McKinney’s 81-yard interception return for a touchdown, and got big plays from Jones and wide receivers DeVonta Smith and Jaylen Waddle.</p>
      <p>Jones only threw one pass after halftime. Smith had four catches for 94 yards and two touchdowns, including a 57-yarder when he juked a defender before sprinting to the end zone. Waddle produced 101 yards and took a screen 54 yards for a touchdown, then returned a punt 49 yards to near the goal line on his next touch.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa’s absence gave his younger brother, Taulia, a chance for his most extended action. The freshman who played at Kapolei came into the game with 12:12 left in the third quarter and threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Smith on his first attempt. He completed two of three passes for 35 yards. Alabama scrapped plans to redshirt the four-star recruit, who already had played in four games.</p>
      <p>Alabama ends the regular season at No. 16 Auburn in its final chance to make a statement for the playoffs.</p>
