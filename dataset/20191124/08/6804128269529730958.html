      <h1>Tammy Abraham's added dimension, Fikayo Tomori too relaxed: Man City vs Chelsea talking points</h1>

      <h3>Contrasting statistics</h3>
      <p>Chelsea may have restricted Manchester City to the least possession of any game managed by Pep Guardiola (a sample size of 381 games including Bayern Munich and Barcelona) but, really, that counted for little.</p>
      <p>While having a larger share of the ball against one of the most dominant sides this sport has ever seen is admirable, another statistic painted a less impressive picture. Chelsea managed just two attempts on target - and that is not good enough when you factor in how many times they counterattacked at pace and into space.</p>
      <h3>Tomori too casual</h3>
      <p>At times Fikayo Tomori looks like the most graceful centre back in the country.</p>
      <p>But when teams with the quality of Manchester City are pressing hard and Chelsea are insisting on playing the ball out from the back, there are some nervy moments.</p>
      <p>Tomori seems to get away with it so often - just when it looks like he is about to be robbed of possession, leaving his team in a big spot of bother, he gets out of trouble.</p>
      <p>Watching it is a nervy experience and you fear that one day soon the England international will be caught out.</p>
      <h3>Abraham's good feet</h3>
      <p>Tammy Abraham is still waiting for his first goal against a big team but this was a game where he displayed the other facets of his game.</p>
      <p>It was the young striker's link-up play that shone brightest at the Etihad, especially during a first half in which Chelsea looked dangerous on the counterattack.</p>
      <p>On a day where much of Abraham's work came with his back to goal, he showed good feet on a couple of occasions to evade challenges before finding either Willian or Christian Pulisic. It was just a pity neither could turn it into something tangible.</p>
      <h3>Emerson struggles</h3>
      <p>This was not a good day for the Italian left back, taken off midway through the second half for Reece James as Cesar Azpilicueta swapped flanks.</p>
      <p>From the opening stages City targeted his flank, meaning Mateo Kovacic was pushed back a little too deep at times, and there moments where Riyad Mahrez turned Emerson inside out.</p>
      <p>The Algerian's decisive goal was a fine finish but it came from the area that Guardiola's team had evidently viewed as a weakness.</p>
      <p>Marcos Alonso looked shaky towards the end of his run in the team while Emerson was out injured and left back is quickly becoming Chelsea's problem position.</p>
      <h3>Rodri - good fall for a big man</h3>
      <p>Whisper it, but Manchester City are masters of the dark arts.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the greatest example came midway through the opening period when Rodri, a hulking presence known for a cynical foul to halt counterattacks, went down in a heap after a minor touch on the shoulder from Christian Pulisic, who is hardly the most physical of Chelsea players.</p>
      <p>He got a free kick for his efforts but it was an example of how City also have a nastier side.</p>
