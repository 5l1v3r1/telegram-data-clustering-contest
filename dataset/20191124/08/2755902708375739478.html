      <p>The Zimbabwe Republic Police has revealed that some police officers were attacked in the Harare central business district. The police alleged that there is a marauding gang which is 16-strong which is going around attacking police officers. Some of the police officers fled and were forced to hide in a fast food outlet. They only managed to leave their refuge after they rescued by another member of the security services.</p>
      <p>In a statement, ZRP National Police Spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said,</p>
      <aside>The Zimbabwe Republic Police condemns acts of hooliganism, attacks on police officers and robbery which occured in Harare Central Business District last night, 22nd November 2019 at 1930 hours.<br/>Three police officers were on patrol along Speke Avenue and moving towards Leopold Takawira. Suddenly, a group of sixteen (16) male adults who are yet to, be identified emerged at the comer of Rezende Street and Speke Avenue. One of the gang members started to assault one of the police officers with open hands whilst the other two officers escaped unhurt and sought refuge at a Harare City Council yard. A police communication radio was stolen in the process.<br/>The criminals proceeded to Engen Service Station, corner Albion and Leopold Takawira Street and severely assaulted two unnamed, police officers who were going home after reporting off duty.<br/>The officers were rescued by a member of the security services and later took shelter inside an Eat and Lick food outlet. In the process, a Gee Investment shop near the service station was looted of various cellphones. The criminals moved to Julius Nyerere Street where they robbed a certain man of US$100.00 and ZW$1 900.00 after assaulting him.<br/>Criminal gangs and unruly elements who are attacking police officers and robbing members of the public in Central Business Districts will only have themselves to blame as the full wrath of the law will be applied in order to ensure the culprits are brought before the courts to face justice.<br/>(NYATHI.

      <p>The attacks on the police come a few days after the police made headlines <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/zimbabwe-police-force-disperse-opposition-crowd-191120111813030.html">all over the world</a> for indiscriminately using brutal and excessive force against civilians.</p>
