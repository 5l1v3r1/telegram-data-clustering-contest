      <p>Alec Baldwin has said that he wishes he had more time in life, particularly regarding his young children.</p>
      <p>The Hollywood star, 61, has four children between the ages of six and one with wife Hilaria, as well as 24-year-old daughter Ireland from his previous marriage to Kim Basinger.</p>
      <p>Asked about becoming a father again later in life, Baldwin told the Observer Magazine: “It’s frustrating. I sit there, with some regularity, driving in a car, or whenever I have a moment to breathe.</p>

      <p>“And I sit there and I think: ‘You know what? I wish I had more time.’</p>
      <p>“There’s drawbacks to my kids, me being this age. But there are benefits, too.</p>
      <p>“I’m there. I’ve made them a priority. It’s made me much more mindful: ‘How do I make the most of my time with them?’”</p>
      <p>The film and TV star said he wishes he had “10 extra years”, adding: “I wish I was 50.</p>
      <p>“But, y’know, life. There is no pause button. There is no reverse button.”</p>
      <p>Baldwin – known for TV series 30 Rock, films including The Aviator and The Departed, and for his impersonations of Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live – said he was keen to have children again after meeting yoga teacher Hilaria, 35, in 2011.</p>

      <p>He said he was “hungry to be a father again” and that this time he “wanted to know these people”.</p>
      <p>Of his previously-strained relationship with his eldest daughter, Baldwin said: “If you did an analysis of the actual days I spent with Ireland (when she was growing up), you’d be appalled at how little it was.”</p>
      <p>Baldwin and his wife were expecting their fifth child together until earlier this month, when Mrs Baldwin revealed she had suffered a miscarriage.</p>
      <p>Baldwin next appears in the film Motherless Brooklyn, a neo-noir crime film directed by Edward Norton.</p>
