      <p>The news comes with the release of a video for his track “Steppa.” Banton gave some insight into how the Roc Nation deal came about, saying, “The connection came about through my association with the great queen, Miss Rihanna herself. A great guy who works alongside her, Omar Grant, we started working together on small stuff, and the idea came about.” Buju Banton is the second reggae artist to team up with Roc Nation, with Damian “Jr. Gong” Marley being the first. Watch the video for “Steppa” above.</p>
