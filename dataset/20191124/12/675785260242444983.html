      <h1>Houston Rockets star James Harden on course to surpass NBA legend Michael Jordan</h1>
      <h2>James Harden is the NBA's top scorer in each of the last two seasons and with an average of 38.3 points per game - Michael Jordan's best was only 37.1</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:23:39+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:23</time> by <a rel="author">Keith Webster, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/keith-webster/</a></address>
      <p>James Harden is on course to do something not even the great Michael Jordan achieved in his illustrious NBA career.</p>
      <p>The Houston Rockets shooting guard has been the top scorer in the league for the past two seasons and has started this one in sensational form.</p>
      <p>Harden is averaging an astonishing 38.3 points per game. The last time anyone came close to those kinds of numbers was when Jordan led the league with 37.1 in 1986-87.</p>
      <p>And you have to go all the way back to 1962-63 to find anyone better when the great Wilt Chamberlain averaged 44.8 a year after he averaged 50.4.</p>

      <p>Harden’s scoring this season becomes all the more remarkable when you consider teams are putting two defenders on him most of the time.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s been like that the whole season. They’ve been running double teams on me. I’ve never seen anything like that.”</p>

      <p>The Rockets have won 11 and lost five this season and host the Dallas Mavericks (10-5) tonight, with Harden saying squad depth is helping them through an injury crisis.</p>
      <p>“This first 16 games, we’ve had six guys out. But we have a very good team – one guy goes down and the next guy steps up, and we’re ready to go again on Sunday.”</p>
      <h3>Lu: My Kind Of Town</h3>
      <p>Great Britain star Luol Deng was honoured by the Bulls last week when they paid a video tribute to him during their game against Detroit.</p>
      <p>Deng, who spent 10 of his 15 seasons in Chicago and retired this year, said: “Chicago means a lot to me, coming here as a young man of 19.</p>
      <p>"I lived in Chicago longer than anywhere else in the world. When you go somewhere else, you start to realise not every city is like Chicago.”</p>
      <h3>Watch out for: Marvin Bagley</h3>
      <p>The second overall pick in the 2018 draft, Bagley released his latest hip-hop album in August, but it is his team-leading 10 rebounds per game plus 14 points per game that the Kings are excited about.</p>
      <h3>Coming up on UK primetime</h3>
      <p>Dallas @ Houston, Sky Sports Arena, Sunday 24th November, 8:30pm</p>
      <p>Denver @ Sacramento, Sky Sports Arena, Saturday 30th November, 10pm</p>
