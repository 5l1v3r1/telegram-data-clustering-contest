        <b>Bamber Bridge 3 Morpeth Town 0</b>
      </p>
      <p>Two goals from Matt Dudley helped Brig to a richly deserved win over Morpeth Town at the Sir Tom Finney Stadium.</p>
      <p>James Dean added a third late in the second half, his fourth in four league starts since joining the club at the end of last month.</p>
      <p>It was Morpeth who had the first clear-cut chance of the game, Sean Taylor firing the ball over the bar after a cutback from Liam Noble.</p>
      <p>Brig’s Ali Waddecar was then brought down just outside the box as he attempted a driving run on 11 minutes.</p>
      <p>Dudley placed the ball down and sent an inch-perfect free-kick over the wall and into the top left corner to give the hosts the lead.</p>
      <p>Brig continued to press as the half went on and Kieran Charnock headed straight at goalkeeper Dan Lawson.</p>
      <p>But Morpeth were still proving a threat, and Noble’s curling effort from 20 yards looked destined for the top corner but instead hit the underside of the bar.</p>
      <p>Lloyd Rigby was then called into action to hold a Jeff Henderson long-distance strike.</p>
      <p>Brig extended their lead 12 minutes into the second half.</p>
      <p>Dudley was played clean through by a clever flick-on from Dean, before flicking the ball through the keeper’s legs and into an empty net.</p>
      <p>Dean then came inches away from making it three – Dudley pulled it back towards the Brig number nine from the right-hand side, before Dean was denied by a fantastic stop from Lawson.</p>
      <p>Dean was not to be denied a place on the scoresheet, however, again thanks to great build-up play from Joey Collins’ side.</p>
      <p>It was Waddecar this time who showed good skill down the right to square to Dean, whose shot on target deflected off a defender and nestled into the bottom corner.</p>
