      <h1>Sir Richard Branson to make a third bid for the National Lottery</h1>

      <p>Sir Richard Branson will make a third attempt to wrest control of the National Lottery from incumbent Camelot, almost twenty years on from the last of his past efforts.</p>
      <p>The decision to enter the running to displace the Canadian company as the lottery operator reignites a rivalry that in the past led to a High Court battle.</p>

      <p>The Sunday Telegraph revealed that representatives for the billionaire founder of the Virgin group had held talks with advisers running the contest to find next operator.</p>
      <p>However, Branson will not get a clear run at Camelot, as the process is already inundated with parties who have declared an interest.</p>
      <p>Publishing magnate Richard Desmond, who currently runs the Health Lottery at a loss, has already entered the fray.</p>
      <p>Desmond’s company Northern &amp; Shell have attacked Camelot for running a “tired, old-fashioned and out-of-date” format in desperate need of new life.</p>
      <p>In 1994, the authorities decided against Branson’s bid, whilst in 2000 only the overturning of a decision to disqualify Camelot by the High Court prevented a Branson victory.</p>
      <p>Sources told the Telegraph that the bid will centre around how to modernise the National Lottery as a means of attracting more younger players and compete better with other online gambling firms.</p>
      <p>Other parties reported to be interested in bidding include Dutch company Novamedia, which operates the People’s Postcode Lottery, and Czech company Sazka.</p>

      <p>Rothschild, EY, Deloitte and Hogan Lovells have been appointed to run the bidding process. Bidders have until mid-December to formally express interest, with a draft license to be published in March.</p>
      <p>The final selection is expected to be made in 2021, with the new operator taking control in 2023.</p>
