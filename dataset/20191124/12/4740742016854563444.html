      <h1>Great Bristol Rovers fans, adaptable Gas, more - What we learned from Shrewsbury Town win</h1>
      <h2>Analysis from the New Meadow yesterday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:26:28+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:26</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Mason</a></address>
      <p>Bristol Rovers picked up a massive three points on the road as they beat Shrewsbury Town 4-3.</p>
      <p>Rovers were never behind in the game, and were 3-1 up, before being brought back to 3-3, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-striker-explains-emotional-3572553">only for Abu Ogogo to score the winner</a> late on.</p>
      <p>Here are the talking points from the game at the New Meadow.</p>
      <h3>Rovers are very adaptable</h3>

      <p>We’ve seen the Gas shape up in several different formations, and today was something a little different again, effectively six in midfield behind Victor Adeboyejo. This worked brilliantly for Rovers, with Captain Ollie Clarke and Liam Sercombe both being afforded more freedom to go forward than normal.</p>
      <p>Whether it’s a back five or a back four, Rovers seemed well equipped to play whatever formation Graham Coughlan wants to play and this is a great sign moving forward, and something which all the top clubs around Europe have.</p>
      <p>They’ve got many players who are versatile themselves, which is a big boost for Coughlan, allowing him to make changes to personnel in certain areas whilst the strength of the team doesn’t worsen.</p>
      <h3>Goals from all over the pitch</h3>

      <p>Rovers were without talisman striker Jonson Clarke-Harris for the trip to Shropshire and it’s been widely talked about the reliance which the Gas have on their number 9, but goals came from different areas of the pitch today.</p>
      <p>Defender Tony Craig started the scoring, before attacking midfielders Liam Sercombe and Ollie Clarke notched, allowing for Ogogo to net the winner.</p>
      <p>It’s vital for Rovers that this continues to happen, especially with the doubt in the fitness of their star striker and with a busy December schedule approaching goals from all over the pitch will boast Rovers play-off hopes massively.</p>
      <h3>Ability to fight back from disappointments</h3>

      <p>While it was largely a comfortable afternoon for the Gas, they were pegged back twice, one of which was when two goals to the good, and it looked as though they had thrown two points away.</p>
      <p>However, the Gas showed their mental strength to come back from the disappointment of being pegged back to earn a crucial late winner.</p>
      <p>Come the end of the season, this could prove to be a massive win for the Gas, who now lay just one point off the play-off places, although their goal difference is significantly worse than those around them in the table.</p>
      <p>It would have been very easy for Rovers to settle for a point after Shrewsbury brought it back to 3-3, but they showed great desire to go on and earn the three points.</p>
      <h3>Away following vital</h3>

      <p>The Gas were backed by an away end of well over 800 in Shrewsbury, and their support was visible throughout the game, even when things weren’t quite going Rovers way.</p>
      <p>With the games coming thick and fast in the coming weeks, the Rovers supporters must continue to well back Coughlan’s side as they go in search of chasing down a play-off place.</p>
      <p>Long trips to Ipswich and Fleetwood are to come in December and the Gas is going to need to be well backed if they are to continue their strong recent form.</p>
      <p>The atmosphere has generally always been positive, but the Gas support must also come when things aren’t quite going their way, as it’s not always going to be positive.</p>
      <h3>Graham Coughlan continues to prove his doubters wrong</h3>

      <p>The job which Coughlan has done since his arrival at the club has been nothing short of exceptional; the 45-year-old led the Gas to safety last season and has had secured brilliant results so far this season.</p>
      <p>He has seen the Gas through to the second round of the FA Cup, as well as progressing through to the next stage of the Leasing.com Trophy, and now sees his side just one point off the play-off places</p>
      <p>He has had many critics this season in particular but he keeps getting his side results and has made his squad very hard to beat, and is starting to add a real cutting edge to his side which was visible in this game as they could’ve easily scored more than four.</p>
      <p>With a busy run of games coming up, the Gas has got a manager who knows the right balance between defence and attack and is prepared to be adaptable in both his team selections and formations.</p>
