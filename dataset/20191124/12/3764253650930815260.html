      <p>- The bill, however, states that a person is free to make an appeal to the High Court against the regulation. Nevertheless, the bill also states that a person cannot make an appeal at the court unless the person has first applied to the Law Enforcement Department.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nigerians' major argument against the bill</b>
      </p>
      <p>From reactions of Nigerians surveyed on social media, their major argument lies on the fact the country already has relevant laws to prosecute the offences listed in the bill. They conclude that any other attempt to create another law regarding this is tantamount to suppressing the freedom of speech which is guaranteed by the Nigerian constitution.</p>
