        <b>The athlete described by many as the greatest basketball player of all time and often compared to another basketball legend Michael Jordan, has recently angered fans by commenting on protests in Hong Kong.</b>

The footage shows the Lakers forward leaving the Mahogany Prime Steakhouse in Oklahoma City with another basketball player Chris Paul and approaching a black SUV. Two fans hoping to get an autograph wished the athlete good luck in the upcoming came, but the superstar simply lifted his leg and broke wind, which was so loud that it was recorded by the camera’s audio from the other side of the parking lot.</p>
      <p>The fans apparently were ok with his move and started laughing, but netizens didn’t like the basketball superstar's behaviour. Not one bit.</p>
