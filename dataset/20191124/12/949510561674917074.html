      <p>Artificial intelligence is spreading into health care, and patients should expect more interaction with it.</p>
      <p>It can already detect an eye disease tied to diabetes and does other behind-the-scenes work like helping doctors interpret scans.</p>

      <p>Experts say even the best software can’t replicate certain things doctors need to treat patients like empathy and common sense.</p>
      <p>At the University of Southern California, researchers are testing an AI-based program called Ask Ari to help students manage stress and stay healthy. Ari doesn’t replace a therapist, but its designers say it will connect students through their phones or laptops to reliable help whenever they need it.</p>
