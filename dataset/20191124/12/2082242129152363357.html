      <p>It’s been an eventful few days for the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/toronto-maple-leafs">Maple Leafs</a>. The team has won both games under new head coach Sheldon Keefe, and <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/295109/tyson-barrie">Tyson Barrie</a> is scoring goals again. It was quite significant that last night’s goal was against his old team and it was a power play goal too. Several monkeys were removed from his back at once there.</p>
      <p>Here’s our recap of the game.</p>

      <p>The Leafs now have a few days off. Their next game is Wednesday against the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/detroit-red-wings">Red Wings</a> who are in a full on tank under new GM Steve Yzerman so he can get some good draft picks.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/buffalo-sabres">Buffalo Sabres</a>—darlings of October—have lost 9 of their last 10 games. That is actually important for the chances of the Leafs making the playoffs. The Leafs have a home-away back-to-back series starting on Friday this week and picking up those wins against a division opponent like that will be critical to getting the team back in the playoff mix.</p>
      <p>The Marlies are playing today at 4:00 p.m. for their second game of the weekend against the Manitoba Moose. Note to anyone who drives to Marlies games: <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/fleet-street/">Fleet Street will be permanently closed to westbound traffic at Bathurst</a> effective tomorrow as a part of the Toronto Vision Zero campaign. You will have to go around via Fort York Blvd. to access the back entrance to the Exhibition Place, or gamble on Lake Shore Blvd. not being a total traffic disaster to get in the front entrance.</p>
