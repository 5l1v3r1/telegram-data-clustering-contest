      <p>The Iranian Navy plans to manufacture a giant destroyer which can navigate in international waters for long journeys.</p>
      <p>Declaring the plan in his remarks on Sunday, Iranian Navy Commander Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi said his force has developed the ‘Negin’ project to build the new destroyer.</p>
      <p>He said the new destroyer will weigh between 5,000 to 7,000 tons and will be able to sail in far-distanced areas for quite a long time.</p>
      <p>The heaviest destroyers being used by the Iranian Naval forces weight nearly 1,300 tons.</p>
      <p>Iran has made major achievements in manufacturing different weapons and military equipment, especially naval vessels.</p>
      <p>The Iranian navy in December announced plans to manufacture a home-made trimaran (with three hulls in parallel) destroyer named Safineh to be used in asymmetric coastal warfare and rapid reaction operations.</p>
      <p>The blueprint of the heavy vessel which is 100 meters long and enjoys the trimaran technology was unveiled late last year.</p>
      <p>Also, low hydrodynamic resistance in high speed and a floating propulsion system appropriate to the needed corresponding dimensions and speed are among other features of Safineh.</p>
      <p>The warship also has a large deck, twice as big as a single-hull vessel of the same tonnage, and it can carry all types of helicopters operating in the Iranian Navy, including RH.</p>
