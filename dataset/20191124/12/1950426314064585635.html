        <b>More Virginia counties declared “Second Amendment Sanctuary” status this week in an effort to get ahead of the gun control promises from Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and newly-elected Democrats.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On November 19, 2019, Breitbart News reported that Appomattox County Board of Commissioners passed a “Second Amendment Sanctuary” resolution, with the goal of opposing any efforts that would “unconstitutionally restrict gun rights.”</p>

      <p>Dinwiddle Supervisor William Chavis said, “We have rights to bear arms. Point blank. And our county, we have a lot of hunters, lots of sportsmen that like to sport shoot.”</p>
      <p>On November 8, 2019, Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/08/ralph-northam-plans-war-guns-democrats-take-virginia-legislature/">reported</a> that Gov. Northam responded to Democrat election victories by readying a war on guns.</p>
