      <p>Around 2.4 million people, or 60.36 per cent of eligible voters, had taken part in the election as of 6:30pm. The figure is much higher than 33.96 per cent turnout rate seen at the same time during the 2015 race.</p>
      <p>Andy, originally from Hong Kong, said that he flew back from California to vote.</p>
      <p>“The whole world sees this election as a referendum,” he told HKFP.</p>

      <p>He said he campaigned for a candidate in the last election four years ago and understood that winning a District Council seat can unlock a lot of resources for the victor.</p>
      <p>“I was in the US during the campaign period and I cannot do much. Voting is what I can do,” he added.</p>
      <p>The District Council election is the only fully democratic city-wide election in the city. Long queues have been observed at multiple polling stations, with security tight following almost six months of protest and unrest.</p>
      <p>It is being seen as a pseudo-referendum between the pro-democracy camp and the pro-Beijing camp, with more than four million people eligible to cast votes.</p>

      <p>The city’s recent political crisis was initially sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill. The movement has since demanded full democracy and an independent investigation into police behaviour.</p>
      <p>Mr Cheung, another voter, flew back from Washington DC to vote in the Islands District.</p>
      <p>He said he decided to fly back in October having followed the protest movement since the beginning.</p>

      <p>“Everything that happened since June made me think that, as a Hongkonger, we have a responsibility to fight against tyranny by doing something we can,” he told HKFP.</p>
      <p>“We have to kick out the pro-establishment camp who betrayed Hong Kong,” he added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Kak – a doctoral student at the University of Maryland – flew back from the states to vote and to help canvass votes for two Democratic Party candidates he supported in the past few days.</p>

      <p>He said he decided to buy a ticket back to Hong Kong last month: “My original district councillor lost her seat by only 40 votes [in 2015] so I decided that it’s worthwhile to buy a ticket to vote,” he told HKFP.</p>
      <p>Polls are set to close at 10.30pm.</p>
