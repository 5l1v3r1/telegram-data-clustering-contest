      <p><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/why-dont-we/"><b>Why Don’t We</b></a> singer <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/corbyn-besson/"><b>Corbyn Besson</b></a> pulled a hilarious prank on his band mates!</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old musician just revealed that he once sent the other guys eggplants in the mail without letting them know.</p>
      <p>“I found this thing online, Eggplant Mail or something like that…but it was anonymous…so I was like, ‘Yo, I’m going to the boys some eggplants!’ So I sent them to their houses,” <b>Corbyn </b>explained, adding that he included a note with song lyrics.</p>
      <p>“I was like, ‘What kind of stalker fan sent me an eggplant?’” <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/daniel-seavey/"><b>Daniel</b></a> explained.</p>
      <p><b>Corbyn </b>added, “So they got them and they didn’t send any pictures of them…so I had to ask, ‘Did y’all get the eggplants?’ And they were like, ‘Ooohh you sent us them!’”</p>
