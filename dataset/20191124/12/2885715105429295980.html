      <h1>India sail to easy win in maiden Day/Night Test, beat Bangladesh by innings &amp; 46 runs</h1>
      <h2>Umesh Yadav's clinical show with the ball in the first hour of play on Day 3 handed India a comprehensive innings and 46 runs victory over Bangladesh.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:29:52+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/sports-desk/" target="_blank">Sports Desk</a></address>
      <p>After pushing Bangladesh on backfoot at the close of play on Day 2, it didn’t take long for India to wrap up the proceedings on Day 3 in India’s first-ever Day/Night Test at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/umesh-yadav/">Umesh Yadav</a>’s clinical show with the ball in the first hour of play on Day 3 handed India a comprehensive innings and 46 runs victory over Bangladesh.</p>

      <p>With this win, India also completed a clean sweep over the visitors in the two-match Test series.</p>
      <p>This was also India’s fourth consecutive innings win, making the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/virat-kohli/">Virat Kohli</a>-led unit the first side to accomplish this feat in the history of Test cricket.</p>
      <p>With an uphill task on hand, Mushfiqur Rahim and Ebadat Hossain resumed the Bangladesh innings from their overnight score of 152/6, trailing by 89 runs, on Day 3.</p>
      <p>Umesh Yadav removed Hossain on a duck after the batsman failed to control a short delivery angling towards him, edging the ball straight to Kohli at gully.</p>
      <p>After his dismissal, Bangladesh batsmen gave up on their hopes to save the match and went for the big shots. Mushfiqur, who emerged as the Bangladesh’s leading run-scorer in the second innings, threw away his wicket while he was batting on 74 as he tried to hit Umesh for a boundary.</p>
      <p>Al-Amin Hossain was the last Bangladeshi player to depart when a short delivery by the 32-year-old took a faint edge off his bat and flew straight to Wriddhiman Saha behind the stumps. Mahmudullah, who suffered a blow earlier in the contest, didn’t come to bat as India secured their 12th series win on home soil.</p>

      <p>Earlier in the opening day of the historic Test match, Mominul Haque’s decision to bat first backfired as the visitors were bundled out for a paltry 106. In response, skipper Kohli played a rock-solid knock of 136 runs helping his team take a match-winning lead of 241 runs.</p>
      <p>A similar fate followed Bangladesh in the second innings as their batsmen were once again rocked by the Indian seamers.</p>
