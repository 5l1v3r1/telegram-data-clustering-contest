      <p>Prince Charles wants <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> to ‘permanently retire’ from public duties, according to a royal source.</p>
      <p>The heir to the throne, is reported to be in disagreement with his younger brother, the Duke of York, who believes he can make a comeback by speaking to the FBI in a bid to clear his name over allegations that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl, Virginia Roberts.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew stepped down from royal duties after what many deemed to be a ‘car crash’ interview with the BBC in which he was grilled over his connections to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender.</p>
      <p>While he intended to make his withdrawal from public life ‘temporary’, Prince Charles is thought to want his expulsion to be permanent, the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7718731/Prince-Andrew-plotting-comeback-Charles-wants-permanently-retired.html">Mail on Sunday reported.</a></p>
      <p>According to a royal source, Prince Andrew has asked his representatives to make contact with the FBI to prove his innocence, in the hope that they will clear his name.</p>

      <p>Commenting on Andrew’s comeback, the source said: ‘I can’t see that Charles would ever let it happen. And many at the Palace just want him out of the scene now – end of. It’s effectively an early retirement.’</p>

      <p>It comes after it emerged that Prince William was reported to be involved in the decision to sack the Duke of York.</p>
      <p>The third in line to the throne is said to believe that the decision to get Andrew to withdraw from public duties was ‘the right thing to do’.</p>
      <p>It has also been reported that Andrew had met Ghislaine Maxwell at Buckingham Palace in early June, two weeks after detectives announced that they were reopening their inquiry into the activities of convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, their mutual friend.</p>
      <p>Ms Maxwell is accused of procuring underage girls for Epstein, a claim she denies.</p>
      <p>Royal insiders have described the Duke as being ‘naively positive’ about a planned comeback.</p>

      <p>Andrew’s problems have been further compounded by major businesses withdrawing their support for his Pitch@Palace initiative, a platform for entrepreneurs he founded.</p>
      <p>Barclays has become the latest firm to withdraw, after accountancy firm KPMG announced that it would not be renewing its sponsorship of his scheme.</p>

      <p>It also emerged last night that the prince stayed at the estate of fashion designer Peter Nygard, who was accused of sexually harassing three female employees.</p>
