      <h1>Petition in Pak. court seeks disqualification of PM Imran Khan</h1>

      <p>A petition has been filed in a Pakistani court seeking disqualification of Prime Minister Imran Khan for his “anti-judiciary” remarks on the departure of his political rival and former premier Nawaz Sharif to London for treatment.</p>
      <p>Tahir Maqsood, a Pakistani citizen, filed the petition in the Lahore High Court on Saturday, seeking contempt of court proceedings against Mr. Khan for bringing the judiciary into disrepute.</p>
      <p>Mr. Khan recently criticised the Lahore High Court for overruling his government’s condition for 69-year-old Sharif to submit a ₹700 crore indemnity bond for permission to fly abroad for treatment, and asked Chief Justice Asif Saeed Khosa and his successor to “restore the public’s trust in the judiciary.”</p>
      <p>His remarks did not go down well with the chief justice, who said the prime minister should refrain from issuing such statements as he is the chief executive of the government.</p>
      <p>“Do not taunt us regarding the powerful,” the chief justice said, adding that everyone is equal before the law.</p>
      <p>“I do not want to comment on the particular case of Nawaz Sharif, which the Prime Minister had referred to but he (the PM) will be aware that he himself gave Nawaz permission to go abroad. The premier should refrain from making such statements...Don’t compare us with the judiciary which had existed before 2009,” Mr. Khosa said.</p>
      <p>The petitioner has said the Prime Minister criticised senior judges of the Supreme Court which amounts to contempt of court.</p>
      <p>He said the Supreme Court in 2013 had already issued a contempt notice to Mr. Khan for his anti-judiciary rants.</p>
      <p>Referring to conviction of PML-N leaders Talal Chaudhry and Nehal Hashmi by the Supreme Court for their anti-judiciary speeches, the petitioner requested the court to summon Mr. Khan in person, disqualify him and order the Election Commission to de-notify him as member of the National Assembly.</p>
