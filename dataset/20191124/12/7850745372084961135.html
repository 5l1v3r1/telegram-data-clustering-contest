      <h1>Ugandans sweep all at MTN Marathon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:07:55+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author">URN</a></address>
      <p>Ugandan runners won the 42km, 21km and 10km races as hundreds of runners turned up Sunday morning to participate in the MTN Kampala Marathon focused on fundraising cash to improve maternal health in the country.</p>
      <p>This is a wrap up of all the marathons that the organisation has run in different regions this year. Denis Cherotich won the men's side for 10km while Sauline Chelangat won the females race. Each received a cash prize of Shs 1.5 million. </p>
      <p>On the 21km, Jacob Kiplimo and Juliet Chekwei took the race, with each receiving Shs 4.5m. The 42km race was won by Phillip Kiplimo with 02:13:56 on the clock. Nyakisi Adero won over the female side in the 42km.</p>
      <p>Kenyans participated in the race but were all beaten to the prize. Wim Vanhelleputte, the MTN Uganda, CEO said he hoped the proceeds from the marathon will reduce an estimated 336 deaths per 100,000 live births in Uganda.</p>
      <p>Dr Ruth Aceng, the minister of Health and the chief guest who flagged off the marathoners hailed the support and said: “no mother should die while giving life to a child.”</p>
      <p>For most people, the marathon was an avenue for having fun. As soon as they were flagged off, a host of them were seen taking selfies to post on social media for their friends. For most companies that sponsored the marathon, the sheer numbers of the people that turned up gives them a pie on brand recognition. Huawei, a Chinese phone maker and the main sponsor, gave out tens of freebies like t-shirts, power banks and phones.</p>
      <p>The company has not announced the amount of money that had been collected.</p>
