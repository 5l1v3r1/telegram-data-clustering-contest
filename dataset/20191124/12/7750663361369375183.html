      <p>Hibs played with a freedom and attacking fluency which was sorely missing during much of the Paul Heckingbottom reign, with goals from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christian-doidge/"><b>Christian Doidge</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/florian-kamberi/"><b>Florian Kamberi</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daryl-horgan/"><b>Daryl Horgan</b></a> doing the damage.</p>
      <p>Although he did not get his name on the scoresheet, Allan was irrepressible throughout and has been buoyed by the opening week of the Ross era.</p>
      <p>The fans' favourite said: "The gaffer has been really positive. His man-management skills with myself and other players have been really good.</p>
      <p>"There's been a lot of camaraderie around the camp this week. That allows you to go and express yourself and I think a lot of players showed that on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"It's all about positivity – you just can't buy it. It depends on certain personalities, and the manager and his assistant (Potter) have been really good for us.</p>
      <p>"John Potter is a real livewire – really funny – and that helps too."</p>
      <p>That sense of positivity has been heightened by Hibernian immediately moving into the top six courtesy of the win.</p>
      <p>Allan added: "It's funny, you get two wins and suddenly it is seven unbeaten – these are the fine lines.</p>
      <p>"But we just need to keep pressing on. We've got games on Tuesday (St Mirren) and Saturday (Kilmarnock) and we need to get up the table."</p>
      <p>Motherwell boss Stephen Robinson was left to rue his side's lack of potency in the final third.</p>
      <p>The visitors opened the scoring through Liam Polworth but, despite having ample possession and territory, failed to cut Hibs open again.</p>
      <p>And Robinson hopes it proves to be a learning curve for his charges.</p>
      <p>He added: "We had numerous half-chances that we should have put away.</p>
      <p>"Some of our decision-making in the last third was a bit selfish when we should have rolled the ball and set someone else up.</p>
      <p>"That's what you get with young players. They beat one man and see the glory. It's that learning curve all the time."</p>
