      <h1>Cyberpunk 2077 enters final stages of development</h1>

      <p>CD Projekt Red recently announced that Cyberpunk 2077 has entered the final stages of development.</p>
      <p>The team recently posted a video detailing their fiscal report for the third quarter of 2019, during which success stories tied to The Switcher and Gwent’s iOS launch where blanketed by the news that Cyberpunk 2077 is almost ready.</p>

      <p>The highly-anticipated game has reached a point where the CD Projekt Red team is ready to start localizing text into supported languages. As a result, it seems Cyberpunk 2077 is well on its way to its scheduled April 16 release date, despite initial delays. In a world teeming with crunch culture, it’s difficult to know whether or not this is a good thing, but being localization-ready five months ahead of launch at least seems to indicate comfortable working conditions.</p>
      <p>In other news, the video also features a report on the continued success of The Witcher 3. The Geralt simulator was the driving factor behind CD Projekt Red posting almost 93 million PLN for their fiscal report, which is close to £18.6 million and indicates a 38% increase from last year. Their cumulative net profit for 2019 is currently sitting pretty just past the 66 million PLN mark (about £13.2 million).</p>
      <p>The video also notes that CD Projekt Red has recently purchased a lovely new office complex, which will apparently allow the company to continue expanding in future.</p>
