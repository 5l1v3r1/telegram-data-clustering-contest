      <p>Deontay Wilder was pretty much losing every second of every round in the Luis Ortiz rematch, that is, until, he violently finished the Cuban with a single punch, winning by brutal knockout in the seventh round.</p>
      <p>America’s hard-hitting heavyweight, the WBC champion, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-deontay-wilder-is-the-john-wick-of-heavyweight-boxing-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">told Business Insider</a> ahead of his 10th world title defense at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas that any opponent of his needs to box perfectly for the 36 minute duration of a 12 round fight.</p>
      <p>Wilder, in contrast, only needs to box perfect for the second it takes to throw and land the perfect straight right hand, he said.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, that proved to be true.</p>
      <p>After being outboxed, out-thought, and out-classed, Wilder sent Ortiz into the ether.</p>

      <p>With victory, Wilder advances his record to 41 knockouts from 42 wins against one draw.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old will now face Tyson Fury for a second time in February, after all parties had pre-agreed a deal according to Business Insider sources.</p>
