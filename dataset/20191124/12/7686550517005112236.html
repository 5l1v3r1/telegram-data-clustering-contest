      <h1>Shaun Edwards reveals his one big Wales regret and the truth about England links</h1>
      <h2>Edwards leaves Wales for a new role with France after making his name here as the world's best defence coach</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:01:15+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:01</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Abbandonato</a></address>
      <p>Shaun Edwards officially bids farewell to Wales this week by outlining his only regret - failing to help Warren Gatland's side reach a World Cup final.</p>
      <p>Gatland and Edwards had three cracks at the tournament, agonisingly losing out at the semi-final stage to South Africa this year, France in 2011 and being condemned to last-gasp quarter-final defeat by the Springboks again in 2015.</p>
      <p>That is the only thing that leaves Edwards with a sense of unfulfillment as he prepares for a new challenge as France defence coach in the upcoming Six Nations.</p>
      <p>"Technically I'm still employed by Wales until November 30," says Edwards, although <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/wayne-pivac-warns-wales-newcomers-17295270">Wayne Pivac and his new backroom team</a> have obviously taken over and have their first match in charge against the Barbarians on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But he told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-7718609/The-one-got-away-France-gain-England-Wales-loss-Shaun-Edwards-plots-new-start.html">Daily Mail</a> he has already started house hunting across the Channel and is excited by the new challenge ahead after so many years at the Wales helm.</p>
      <p>Reflecting upon his time here, which saw Wales emerge from the doldrums and win three Grand Slams, Edwards said: "The coaching group, the players and people like JR the kitman have been together a long time. It’s an emotional game rugby. You make friends and a lot of those guys remain friends.</p>
      <p>"My only regret with Wales is not getting to a World Cup final. The Welsh people were unbelievably good to me. They treated me as one of their own and we weren’t able to give them that ultimate game.</p>
      <p>"It was so near yet so far. We’ve lost in three World Cups by a total of eight points. One point in 2011, four points in 2015 and three points this time. Elite level sport is small margins.</p>

      <p>"To have eight points in three World Cup exits shows you’re competitive. I’d like to think we did a decent job and that Welsh rugby is respected around the world."</p>
      <p>The next time Edwards comes to the Principality Stadium, it will be part of the away team as he takes up his new role under Fabien Galthie in the Six Nations.</p>
      <p>"If France beat Wales, I won’t celebrate too much. I’ve got a lot of respect for Wales and the Welsh public. I won’t be throwing up my arms in the air," he says.</p>
      <p>"I’m a professional, so I will be doing my job to the best of my ability. I’ve been having a few French lessons. Listening to a few CDs. I’m determined to speak in French.</p>
      <p>"To be honest, when I coach I don’t actually speak that much. A lot of it is about drills and repetition of drills under fatigue. Repetition, repetition, repetition."</p>

      <p>There had been various attempts to prise Edwards away from Welsh rugby down the years, including talk of England wanting him as their head coach.</p>
      <p>Speaking about that for the first time, he says: "I didn’t get an absolute offer from England but there was talk. I’m a realist and I get on with what’s in front of me.</p>
      <p>"I don’t dream about this job and that job. I’m 53 and I like to think that I’ve got 15 years left in coaching.</p>
      <p>"I’ve been a professional since 1983 and you can tell if someone really wants you when you’re negotiating. I’d be excited to coach England one day but someone has to really want you."</p>
      <p>But for the next four years he is focused upon France and, perhaps, finally getting to that elusive World Cup final with his new team.</p>
