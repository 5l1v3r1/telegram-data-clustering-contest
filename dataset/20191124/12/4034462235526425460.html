      <h1>Aston Martin Has Something Special Coming This Week</h1>
      <h2>The next chapter in the Aston Martin Wings Series is upon us.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:20:32+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:20</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Joseph</a></address>
      <p>The British are no strangers to the pursuit of speed – whether it comes in the form of a high-powered sports car (like an Aston Martin) or a supersonic jet aircraft (like the Concorde). Now the two are coming together in what appears to be a new special edition.</p>
      <p>Aston Martin and British Airways tweeted out this teaser of what looks like a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/aston-martin/dbs-superleggera">DBS Superleggera</a> that's somehow supposed to encapsulate the spirit of the Concorde – that ground- and sound-barrier-braking passenger jet that was jointly developed and operated by the British and the French.</p>

      <p>As little as the animated teaser reveals, <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/aston-martin-dbs-superleggera-concorde-edition-set-imminent-reveal">Autocar</a> reports that it'll be a special edition of the DBS, decked out in white with the red and blue of the Union Jack flag.</p>
      <p>Only a couple of weeks ago, Aston Martin announced the creation of a new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/aston-martin-shows-awesome-aviation-inspired-special-editions">Wings Series</a>, leveraging the automaker's ties to the aerospace industry with a line of special editions. Aston previously put out the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/aston-martin-vanquish-s-red-arrows-edition-honors-acrobatic-airplanes">Vanquish S Red Arrows Edition</a> (pictured at bottom) in 2017 to celebrate the Royal Air Force's aerobatics squadron, similar to the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/aston-martin-s-latest-special-edition-looks-ready-to-fly">V8 Vantage S Blades Edition</a> (below) it produced previously. This, then, would appear to represent the next chapter in the Wings Series, and the first since its official formation.</p>

      <p>"Aston Martin will always be synonymous with aviation, from our wings logo to the heritage of our manufacturing sites across the UK," said Aston chief Andy Palmer in the Wings Series announcement, referring to the three out of four of its British factories that are built on the sites of former RAF air bases. "The Vanquish S Red Arrows edition was a great success for everyone concerned and I look forward to seeing our future aviation-related special editions."</p>
      <p>Whatever form it ultimately takes, we'll find out soon enough. The reveal is scheduled for this Tuesday, November 26, at the Aston Martin dealer in Bristol – the same town in which the last Concorde ever flown is on permanent display.</p>
