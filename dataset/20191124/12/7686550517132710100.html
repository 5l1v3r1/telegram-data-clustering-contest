      <h1>Cardiff bar 10 Feet Tall is letting homeless people use their address to register to vote</h1>
      <h2>The bar is the latest to offer use of their address to homeless people</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:57:46+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:57</time> by <a rel="author">Marcus Hughes</a></address>
      <p>A Cardiff bar is opening its doors to help homeless people register to vote.</p>
      <p>The deadline to register to vote in December's general election is Tuesday, November 26.</p>
      <p>Those who are eligible but fail to register will be unable to cast their vote, but many homeless people struggle without a permanent address.</p>
      <p>But popular Cardiff bar 10 Feet Tall, on Church Street, is offering to help people with no fixed abode or a permanent address to register as the clock ticks down to the final deadline.</p>
      <p>The venue's marketing manager Caitlin Whelan said anyone is welcome to drop in after 12pm on Sunday or Monday for a hot drink and help with the necessary forms.</p>

      <p>"We saw the Bristol Beer Factory initiative and we saw a few of them around the country and we were really inspired by that," Caitlin said.</p>
      <p>"We are a city centre venue and we feel it is really important this time around, as it is any time, to give people the opportunity to have their say.</p>
      <p>"They can have a coffee or a tea while they fill out their forms."</p>
      <p>The Electoral Commission allow people who do not have a permanent address to register at an address where they spend part of their time.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, people can provide an address near to a place where they spend a lot of their time.</p>

      <p>"One of the requirements is that it is near to where you normally spend your time," Caitlin said.</p>
      <p>"As we are near to St Mary Street we are offering people the opportunity to use our address."</p>
      <p>Swansea business Cinema &amp; Co announced they would offer <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/general-election-electoral-roll-homeless-17302940">similar assistance earlier this week</a> .</p>
      <p>"We put it out yesterday so today and tomorrow we are expecting some people through the doors," Caitlin said.</p>
      <p>"Homeless shelters have spread the word so we are expecting some people."</p>
      <p>Homeless charity Crisis is also offering advice for rough sleepers who want to vote <a href="https://www.crisis.org.uk/get-help/information-for-crisis-members/member-news/how-to-register-to-vote-if-you-re-homeless/?fbclid=IwAR0LrSC5352ytzhHnezwwK0WRxM1PJVF2JHge-nBmPW37fbFPLXYTsgzHDE">here</a> .</p>
