      <p>Uber could be on the verge of a complete ban, with rumours swirling that Transport for London (TfL) may not renew its licence tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Uber’s operating licence runs out on Tuesday at midnight, after TfL only granted the ride-hailing app a two-month probationary extension in September.</p>

      <p>A senior Uber employee recently told <i>City A.M.</i> the company was “confident” of getting a licence extension, however a TfL source said this may not eventuate.</p>
      <p>The source told <i><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/uber-fights-rearguard-action-as-regulators-weigh-london-ban-11867918">Sky News</a> </i>that the transport body is “actively considering” the “nuclear option” of banning Uber for failing to show it had done enough to improve passenger safety.</p>
      <p>They added there was “zero chance” Uber would be granted a long-term licence due to the frantic nature of discussions.</p>
      <p>A TfL spokesperson said a decision would be made on a potential licence extension tomorrow.</p>
      <p>“TfL is considering Uber’s application and no decision has been made,” they said.</p>
      <p>It comes just days after reports that TfL may force the Silicon Valley giant to provide scans of drivers’ fingerprints or faces.</p>
      <p>A document circulated around the mayor of London’s office reportedly says this implementation of biometric checks could be a part of any licence requirement, according to Wired.</p>
      <p>TfL already placed several new requirements on Uber when it granted the two-month licence – including more stringent rules on driver and licence checks – after the body said it needed to see more that Uber could “ensure passenger safety”.</p>
      <p>Two weeks ago, the company announced it had introduced three new safety measures – making discrimination easier to report, more driver training and new accident reporting systems.</p>

      <p>If TfL fails to renew the company’s licence it would mark the second time Uber has been banned in the capital.</p>
      <p>It was banned by TfL in 2017, before a court appeal allowed the app to continue to operate for a further 15 months.</p>
