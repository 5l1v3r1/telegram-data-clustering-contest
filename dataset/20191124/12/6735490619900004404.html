      <h1>Kit Harington Saves Woman’s Bike From Thieves</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:37:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:37</time> by <a rel="author">Brent Furdyk</a></address>
      <p>Kit Harington played a hero on “Game of Thrones”, and he recently demonstrated his heroic side in real life.</p>
      <p>Twitter user Michelle Meagher recently shared a story about how the 32-year-old actor “saved my sister’s bike from thieves tonight, carrying it into the pub where she was because he didn’t to want leave it unchained outside.”</p>
      <p>Harington left before the woman had a chance to thank him, so Meagher took to Twitter in order to “tweet this thanks out into the ether,” as Harington has no presence on social media.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Britain’s <a href="https://www.shropshirestar.com/entertainment/showbiz/2019/11/24/glenda-jackson-and-kit-harington-star-in-christmas-day-drama/"><i>Shropshire Star</i></a> is reporting that Harington’s next project will be for neither film nor television, but radio.</p>
      <p>Harington will co-star with Glenda Jackson in a radio play based on Neil Gaiman’s short story <i>Chivalry</i> for BBC 4 Radio.</p>

      <p>Jackson — who paused her movie career to spend 23 years as a Labour MP — will voice the character of Mrs Whitaker, who discovers the Holy Grail in a secondhand shop.</p>
      <p>She then receives a visit from one of the Knights of the Round Table, Sir Galahad (Harington), who would like to reclaim it.</p>
      <p>The radio production of <i>Chivalry </i>is scheduled for broadcast on Christmas Day.</p>
