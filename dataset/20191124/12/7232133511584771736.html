      <h1>Bitcoin Price Likely to Drop Towards $6,000 if History Rhymes</h1>

      <p>After plunging to $6,800 on Friday, Bitcoin (BTC) has been subject to some reprieve; the cryptocurrency now trades at $7,300, up some 8-odd percent from the bottom. While this bounce is somewhat positive for bulls, especially considering the historical importance of the high-$6,000s, a key indicator suggests that there may be more pain to come for the market.</p>

      <h3>Bitcoin May Have Further to Drop, RSI Suggests</h3>
      <p>Analyst Byzantine General recently noted that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) — an oscillating indicator that tracks if an asset is overbought, oversold, or somewhere in between by factoring in the “magnitude of recent price changes” — for the one-day Bitcoin chart has hit 25, meaning slightly oversold.</p>
      <p>The significance of this: Bitcoin’s one-day RSI rarely drops below 30, and normally hits 20 when it does. With this precedent in place, there is a high likelihood that BTC will continue to head lower from current price levels.</p>

      <h3>But… But… the Bottom is In</h3>
      <p>While Byzantine’s analysis of the RSI indicator suggests there is more pain to come, there is a confluence of evidence supporting the idea that Bitcoin found a local, and maybe ultimate, bottom in and around $6,700.</p>
      <p>Firstly, as <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/23/bitcoins-local-bottom-found-6800-analysts-assert/">reported by NewsBTC previously</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/scottmelker">Scott “The Wolf of All Streets” Melker</a> noted that during yesterday’s plunge to $6,800, BTC’s four-hour RSI hit 6.5, which is the lowest ever on Coinbase’s market and the lowest it has been in 2019. As the RSI oscillates between 0 and 100, a reading of 6.5, which is extremely rare, implies that the asset being analyzed is extremely oversold, and due to bounce as a result.</p>

      <p>That’s not all. Dave the Wave, an analyst who called the drop to $6,700 months and months ago, said that there is a confluence of technical factors that suggest a long-term bottom was put in at $6,700. This confluence includes but isn’t limited to the three-year moving average—which currently sits in the low-$6,000s—is where BTC historically has found support in early bull markets and the fact that the cryptocurrency has bounced off the 0.5 Fibonacci Retracement level of the $3,200 to $13,800 range, implying bottoming price action.</p>
