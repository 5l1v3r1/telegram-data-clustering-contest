      <p>Marc Jaromin was asked a simple question by executives of the E.W. Scripps company when he was interviewed for the job of general manager at WKBW-TV: “Do you know what Dyngus Day is?”</p>
      <p>“If you’re from Buffalo, you know what Dyngus Day is,” said Jaromin of the Polish-American holiday observed after Easter Sunday. “Not only knowing what it is, but knowing there is a micro-community in this town that is very important to them.”</p>
      <p>Born in Lackawanna, Jaromin grew up in Rochester but frequently came to Buffalo on weekends to watch Bills games with relatives.</p>
      <p>“We were here almost every Sunday, especially during football season,” he said in a recent interview. “We had season tickets since I was 12 years old and I'll have them again. Clearly Buffalo is more home to me than Rochester ever was.”</p>
      <p>His first television job was as an account executive at WKBW in 1997, when the station was owned by Granite Broadcasting. He eventually became local sales manager before leaving in 2001.</p>
      <p>“I was on the set when Irv Weinstein retired,” Jaromin said of that Dec. 31, 1998, day.</p>
      <p>The ABC affiliate was still strong during the early Granite years when Jaromin was here, but Granite soon presided over the station’s slide from No.1 to No.3.</p>
      <p>It remains deep in third place now, with Jaromin’s mission to make the station more competitive.</p>
      <p>He took over for former General Manager Michael Nurse, who was in charge when Scripps purchased the station in 2014 and was fired a few months ago.</p>
      <p>Besides his Western New York roots, Jaromin brings an extensive television resume that may have attracted Scripps. He was a philosophy and theology major for two years at Canisius College before transferring to the State University of New York at Oswego to study marketing and broadcasting. He graduated in 1984.</p>
      <p>After graduation, Jaromin worked in advertising for a company that did work with the Bills; was general manager of WROC-TV in Rochester for Nexstar, a company that owns WIVB-TV; bought and sold a station in Jackson, Miss.; bought Fusion Media with partners in Davenport, Iowa, that shared services with 27 stations and turned into Stratos Broadcast Services before selling it within two years; and was director of media for a regional sports network in Ohio.</p>
      <p>Along the way, he said he grew a reputation as a guy who fixes things.</p>
      <p>That is his mission at WKBW.</p>

      <p>Since arriving a month ago, Jaromin has been meeting with employees one-on-one and plans to continue to do so before making any decisions on what needs to be done.</p>
      <p>He has had plenty of time on his hands since he is living in a downtown hotel. His wife, Michelle, a Western New York native, and two daughters haven’t moved here yet.</p>
      <p>“I’ve promised my wife no Left Bank, no Hutch’s, no Siena until she gets here,” he said of three of Western New York’s finer restaurants.</p>
      <p>He likes the talent on the station as much as a good meal.</p>
      <p>“Their commitment to journalism is strong, their commitment to the community is strong,” Jaromin said. “I think one of the things that I really like is their ability to look at the news of the day, if you will, and understand that how that gets communicated is different to different groups."</p>
      <p>One of the first contractual issues he needed to address was that of longtime anchor Keith Radford, who had a verbal agreement with Nurse to stay on beyond the end of his contract at year’s end. Jaromin is expected to follow through with that agreement.</p>
      <p>“I have total respect for Keith and have sat down a couple of times one on one since I've been here,” Jaromin said. “His commitment to the next generation, and coaching and training and guiding the young journalists that are coming into our organization is unmatched anywhere I've been. He’s not going anywhere.”</p>
      <p>He also had nice things about other talent on the station, praising the commitment of the station’s main anchors, Jeff Russo and Ashley Rowe.</p>
      <p>“One of the things I look for is the individual personality and then the team personality and they come across as a good team,” he said.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t sound like anyone at WKBW has anything to immediately worry about as Mr. Fix-It assesses what is needed to improve the station’s status.</p>
      <p>“Immediately, I'm listening,” said Jaromin. “Bringing change without listening is just not a successful plan.”</p>
      <p>“My role is to remove the obstacles. My role is to bring out the best and give the talent that's there the most opportunity to be successful … for someone who's gone around the country, fixing things. I'm not a change agent. I'm a person that comes in and tries to accentuate the positives and the strength of organizations.”</p>
      <p>Jaromin said his decision to join the Scripps team and return to Western New York — where he still has many aunts, uncles and cousins — has been all about timing. He reached out to Scripps when he saw the general manager’s job was available.</p>
      <p>“I've obviously been in the industry for a while,” Jaromin said. “I’m very impressed with Scripps as a company, its commitment in journalism, commitment to local communities.”</p>
      <p>Jaromin said he and Scripps were on the same philosophical page — that "journalism matters."</p>
      <p>“It's important. Community matters," he said. "It's important and the industry as a whole is changing. One of the stories I like to tell is having spent as much time as I have in Rochester. Eastman Kodak went from 50,000-60,000 employees at one point down to 12,000 or 13,000. They didn't realize they were in the memory business, they thought they were in the film business.</p>
      <p>“Today consumer behavior is changing whether you want to call it cord cutting on the cable side. People are watching more TV, more video than they've ever watched before, they are just watching it in their platform of choice. As a result, the broadcast industry has got to be responsive to that. We've got to be able to look at our content. And share our content with our consumers in different ways.</p>
      <p>“And that for me is what's most exciting about the industry today. Our ability to have relationships with our communities that are beyond just a broadcast station. We will always be the go-to source for breaking weather, breaking news, things that are happening, and that is our commitment to the community. But to have micro community relationships across multiple platforms, that's the future.”</p>
      <p>Scripps investment in WKBW and the product improvement hasn’t resulted in the ratings gains that might have been expected in a market that is slow to change.</p>
      <p>“I think as an industry we're at a seminal moment in terms of consuming, so I think your 50-plus group has habits that they're used to and comfortable with,” Jaromin said. “And we as a station need to give them permission to say they're watching us.”</p>
      <p>“They have to be comfortable with us as a TV station, be comfortable with us as a news team. And part of that is our relationship with the community.”</p>
      <p>He hopes to engage younger viewers with what is important to them on whatever platform they use.</p>
      <p>“When you are down below that age 50 and under group, in the (first) days I’ve been here we've competed on the digital platforms on par,” said Jaromin.</p>
      <p>While WKBW’s Nielsen ratings remain low, he claims the station does better when counting impressions on social networks that attract younger viewers.</p>
      <p>“I think it's a generational divide today,” said Jaromin. “I am proud and confident of the product that we're putting out there. My commitment right now is to engage the community in a new and unique way.”</p>
      <p>“Are we relating to them at their level and on their platform? Instagram is different from Twitter is different from Facebook is different from broadcast shows. So how we relate and how we communicate just needs to adapt to consumer behavior, to be responsive to that.”</p>
      <p>If the strategy works, WKBW’s celebration may eventually rival that of Dyngus Day.</p>
