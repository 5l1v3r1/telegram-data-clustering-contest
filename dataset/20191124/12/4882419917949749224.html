      <p>Zinedine Zidane was once again asked about Gareth Bale after the Welshman was whistled by his own supporters during Real Madrid's 3-1 win over Real Sociedad on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Bale came on in the second half and was jeered following events with Wales in the week. The forward celebrated his nation's qualification for Euro 2020 in front of a flag which carried the words: 'Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order.'</p>
      <p>"I hope the whistling does not continue for the rest of the season," Zidane said after the game. "We want the fans to be with us at all times. Bale also needs the fans.</p>
      <p>"I understand that they want to express themselves, but I would like them to applaud every player. I cannot really say if the whistling towards him (Bale) was unfair, but I was happy with his performance and the result."</p>
