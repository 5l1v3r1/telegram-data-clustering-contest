      <p>WWE Executive Vice President Triple H is one of the men primarily responsible for making NXT what it is today. One of the things that he does so well is to craft together some extremely engaging storylines with wrestling action on another level altogether.</p>
      <p>So far, this has worked out well. Managing <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a> is one of Triple H's primary responsibilities, alongside other executive issues that he needs to deal with on a day-to-day basis. One of the things that <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/triple-h">Triple H</a> has been very open about is expanding NXT to broader international markets, including Japan and India. He talked about the same in the post-WarGames media scrum.</p>

      <h3>Triple H on WWE and NXT 'could kill it' in India and Japan</h3>
      <p>Triple H has long been focused on expanding the NXT brand to make it a real global presence. This is something that they have already achieved in the United Kingdom, with NXT UK airing weekly episodes.</p>
      <p>Triple H said that the expansion was a 'work-in-progress' and something that they were all working towards.</p>
      <p>Wrestling Inc <a href="https://twitter.com/WrestlingInc/status/1198449674413326336?s=20">reported</a> that Triple H said that they were going all over the world and that they could 'kill it' in India, Japan, and the rest of the world very soon. This expansion will come as good news to wrestling fans as their access to wrestling will only grow in the coming years.</p>
