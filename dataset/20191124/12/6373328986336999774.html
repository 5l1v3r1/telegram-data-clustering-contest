        <b>An Asda delivery driver has been hailed a hero after running into a house fire to save a newborn baby.</b>
      </p>
      <p>26-year-old Habeel Khan was making his way around his usual delivery route when he saw smoke coming from a house in Stapleford, Nottinghamshire.</p>
      <p>After stopping his van to see what was happening, Khan saw a woman with two young children, who shouted to him her baby was still inside the house.</p>

      <p>Acting on ‘natural instinct’, Habeel immediately ran into the house with the woman, where they found the seven-week-old baby in the room next to the kitchen, where the fire had started, and safely carried it out of the burning building.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Habeel told <i><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/asda-worker-describes-how-helped-3570458">Nottinghamshire Live</a></i>:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>It was a just a normal day at work for me. I was doing my deliveries in the Stapleford area and when I pulled up and looked over to where the customer’s house was I saw loads of smoke just gushing out of a house.<br/><br/>My natural instinct was to just run across to the house. I could see loads of smoke and lots of people panicking outside.</blockquote>

        <b>Habeel added:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I shouted ‘is everyone out of the house?’ and that’s when a woman with two young children shouted ‘my baby; my baby’s still in the house.’<br/><br/>I don’t think she had realised until then and then she ran back into the house and I went with her.<br/><br/>She managed to pick up the baby from a room next to the kitchen where the fire had started, then we ran out.</blockquote>
      <p>The 26-year-old then stayed with the family until firefighters and paramedics arrived, before he got back in his van and carried on with the rest of his deliveries.</p>
      <p>Asda have since named Habeel their Colleagues’ Colleague of the Year at the Being Asda Awards 2019, for his quick thinking and brave actions.</p>

        <b>Habeel said:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I didn’t really think anything of it – I just thought I’d helped out, and had done a little good deed.<br/><br/>I don’t think I have done anything heroic at all to be honest. Thankfully everyone was okay in the end and the family are back in the house.</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>Asda’s senior vice president of operations Anthony Hemmerdinger said:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>What Habeel did was remarkable and it’s not something we would recommend that our colleagues do, however it’s clear that in this instance his instinct kicked in and he did a remarkable job.</blockquote>
      <p>Keep up the good work, Habeel!</p>
