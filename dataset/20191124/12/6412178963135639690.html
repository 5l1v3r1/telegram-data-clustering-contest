        <b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/tag/trent-alexander-arnold">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> has claimed <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/liverpool">Liverpool’s</a> “team spirit” and “resilience” saw them through against Crystal Palace, and insists the Reds are up for the fight this season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s side have won 12 of their opening 13 league matches, with their battling spirit typified in <b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/liverpool-benefit-from-var-in-victory-at-crystal-palace">Saturday’s 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace</a></b>, in which they responded to their hosts’ late equaliser by grabbing an even later winner through Roberto Firmino.</p>
      <p>“We have been showing that throughout the course of the season and even last season we showed how much of a good team spirit we have got and resilience,” Alexander-Arnold told the <b><a href="http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/374434-trent-alexander-arnold-reaction-crystal-palace">club’s official website</a></b>.</p>
      <p>“We had a setback with their goal and we bounced back pretty much straight away. We showed our quality and went up the other end and scored.</p>
      <p>“That’s what good teams do, find a way to win, and that’s what we have done.</p>
      <p>“The first game back after an international break is always difficult because you go away, you play a different style and then you have to try to come back in,” he said.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got players travelling all over the world and obviously a bit of jetlag in there but, again, we’ve come back to have a few days of training and we’ve performed not at our best but we’ve got the win.</p>
      <p>“It was a tough game and this is always one of the toughest places to come, Selhurst Park, with the crowd right on top of you it’s going to be a really tough game.</p>
      <p>“They’ve got some really good players and it’s always, for some reason, really difficult coming here so we’ve done well to get the win. We knew it meant a lot so hopefully we’ll be able to keep going and use this as momentum.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool lead the Premier League table by eight points over second-placed Leicester and nine over defending champions Manchester City.</p>
