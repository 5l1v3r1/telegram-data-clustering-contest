      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Pakistan on Saturday urged Norway to bring those involved in desecration of the Holy Quran incident to justice and to prevent the recurrence of any such incident in the future.</p>
      <p>As per details, the Ambassador of Norway was called to the Foreign office and was conveyed the deep concern of the government and people of Pakistan over the incident of desecration of the Holy Quran in the Norwegian city of Kristiansand.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, such actions could not be justified in the name of freedom of expression, Foreign Office said.</p>
      <p>The Ambassador of Pakistan in Oslo has also been instructed to convey Pakistan’s protest and deep concern to the Norwegian authorities.</p>
      <p>Muslims across the world have been praising the Muslim man – now being called the ‘Defender of Quran’ – who attacked Lars Thorsen, the leader of the ‘Stop Islamisation of Norway (SIAN)’, for burning a copy of the Holy Quran during an anti-Islam rally in Norway.
