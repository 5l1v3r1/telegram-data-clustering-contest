      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/game-of-thrones/">Game Of Thrones</a> star Dean-Charles Chapman has supported the notion the alternative ending to the HBO show should be released.</p>
      <p>Clearly someone is thinking of the fans!</p>
      <p>The star, who played Tommen Baratheon, was recently asked about the other ending that may put to rest the vitriol fans have for the finale that divided the viewership.</p>
      <p>Last week Tormund star Kristofer Hivju – who was reunited with co-stars Gemma Whelan (Yara Greyjoy) and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/isaac-hempstead-wright/">Isaac Hempstead Wright</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bran-stark/">Bran Stark</a>) at a Game of Thrones Celebration – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/game-thrones-cast-filmed-alternative-ending-season-8-well-never-see-reveals-tormund-star-kristofer-hivju-11179830/">revealed the cast did film another ending to the show</a> which we’ll likely never see.</p>
      <p>‘Well, we shot an alternative ending,’ he revealed to Metro.co.uk. ‘That was mostly for fun but I don’t know if I’m allowed to tell you about that.’</p>

      <p>When pushed to reveal which key players from Westeros were involved, the Norwegian-born actor was keeping quiet.</p>

      <p>Now Dean-Charles, who left the show in 2016 after his character’s death, has called for the alternative cut.</p>
      <p>‘Yeah, why not?’ he said when asked by TMZ whether HBO should release it.</p>
      <p>When pressed further and suggested the other ending may ‘mend the fans’ hearts’ he said: Exactly.’</p>
      <p>‘I know they’re doing spinoffs as well…’ he said, referring to the prequels of the show <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/game-of-thrones-prequel-axed-by-hbo-over-fears-it-would-alienate-fans-11024659/">that may or may not be happening.</a></p>
      <p>He added of the idea we may see the other ending: ‘I’ll be watching.’</p>
      <p>Fans were livid when they were presented with the final episode of season eight and, thus, the entire show.</p>
      <p>After the most obvious candidate for King, Jon Snow (played by Kit Harington), was banished for killing ‘his Queen’ Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clark), Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright) was appointed ruler of what became the Six Kingdoms.</p>
      <p>Even Kristofer was shocked by the eventual outcome.</p>
      <p>‘The funny thing is after season seven I had my theories…the cast had their theories so there were thousands of theories,’ he explained. ‘To choose one path would be difficult to say but there were many things I didn’t see coming; there was the element of surprise which I liked.’</p>
