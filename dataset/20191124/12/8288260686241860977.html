      <p>Aldi's website was besieged on Sunday morning as thousands of shoppers queued to snap up Kevin the Carrot toys.</p>
      <p>The discount supermarket chain launched sales of its range of merchandise depicting the fun figure made famous by its TV advertisements and there was soon a long line of customers waiting to purchase the toy.</p>
      <p>But many were left disappointed with the toys soon selling out.</p>

      <p>Website users were greeted with the message that they had been automatically placed in a queue due to the fact 'there are currently lots of people trying to access the Aldi website'.</p>
      <p>The queue was around five minutes when our colleagues at StokeonTrentLive visited the site they were assigned queue number 224582 - with 2,321 other users ahead of them.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for people keen to get their hands on them, these had sold out by 11am.</p>
      <p>A message on the queueing page stated: "Oops! It looks like we're all sold out of Kevin and friend's plush toys. Give your local Aldi store a try from Thursday 28th November to see what's on offer."</p>
      <p>Aldi has branches across Birmingham and the Black Country and customers queued for hours to secure a bargain when a new store opened last week in Carters Green, West Bromwich.</p>
