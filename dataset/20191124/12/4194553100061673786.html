      <h1>“Humiliated” Jadon Sancho could move in January; LFC &amp; Man Utd “options” – report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:28:02+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Borussia Dortmund flyer Jadon Sancho is reportedly ready to pack it in at the Westfalenstadion, with Liverpool and Manchester United “<b>options</b>” for the youngster.</p>
      <p><a href="https://theathletic.com/1403402/2019/11/24/exclusive-jadon-sancho-feels-humiliated-and-scapegoated-by-dortmund-amid-interest-from-barcelona-liverpool-united-and-real/">That’s according to The Athletic journalist David Ornstein</a> – who is reporting that the winger has been left “<b>humiliated/scapegoated/unprotected</b>” by Dortmund.</p>
      <p>The Bundesliga outfit were shook by Paderborn who managed to put three past them without response, but der BVB did eventually reply with three goals of their own.</p>
      <p>Just prior to that, they were smashed 4-0 by bitter rivals Bayern Munich, and – <a href="https://theathletic.com/1403402/2019/11/24/exclusive-jadon-sancho-feels-humiliated-and-scapegoated-by-dortmund-amid-interest-from-barcelona-liverpool-united-and-real/">as per the same report</a> – it’s around this time that Sancho is said to have been left mortified by the treatment he received from fans.</p>
      <p><a href="https://theathletic.com/1403402/2019/11/24/exclusive-jadon-sancho-feels-humiliated-and-scapegoated-by-dortmund-amid-interest-from-barcelona-liverpool-united-and-real/">Ornstein claims</a> that Liverpool, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona are potential destinations for the England international. He also states that Man City have asked to be kept informed, while Chelsea haven’t made any contact.</p>
      <p>Sancho could cost potential suitors around £100million – and with Liverpool and United being two of the clubs interested, Dortmund will be sure to get what he’s worth and <a href="https://theathletic.com/1403402/2019/11/24/exclusive-jadon-sancho-feels-humiliated-and-scapegoated-by-dortmund-amid-interest-from-barcelona-liverpool-united-and-real/">the same The Athletic report</a> states that he could move as early as January.</p>
      <p>I’d suggest clubs to not be so hasty though – the winger is showing a lot of promise, and really looks to be a talent, but there’s no way to know if the teenager will go on the become a star or the next Aaron Lennon.</p>
