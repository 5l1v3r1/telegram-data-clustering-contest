      <p><a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/~schwit1">schwit1</a> shared this new from the Washington Post: <i>Police officers who download videos captured by homeowners' Ring doorbell cameras <a href="https://www.stripes.com/police-can-keep-ring-camera-video-forever-and-share-with-whomever-they-d-like-company-tells-senator-1.607928">can keep them forever and share them with whomever they'd like</a> without providing evidence of a crime, the Amazon-owned firm told a lawmaker this month...

Edward Markey, D-Mass., said in a statement that Ring's policies showed that the company had failed to enact basic safeguards to protect Americans' privacy. "Connected doorbells are well on their way to becoming a mainstay of American households, and the lack of privacy and civil rights protections for innocent residents is nothing short of chilling," he said. "If you're an adult walking your dog or a child playing on the sidewalk, you shouldn't have to worry that Ring's products are amassing footage of you and that law enforcement may hold that footage indefinitely or share that footage with any third parties."</i> <br/>While Ring tells users not to film public roads are sidewalks, Ring isn't enforcing that, according to the article. Amazon argues that that's ultimately the user's responsibility.<br/><br/>And will their cameras start using facial recognition algorithms? Amazon answers that that feature is "contemplated but unreleased," though they add that "We do frequently innovate based on customer demand," and point out that other competing security cameras are already offering facial-recognition...</p>
