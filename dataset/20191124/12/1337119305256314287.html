      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:34:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner" target="_blank">Cameron Faulkner</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a> deals on Google products are happening all over the web, including at Google’s online storefront. Regardless of where you shop, be it Best Buy, Amazon, B&amp;H Photo, or Walmart, the discounts cover almost its entire range of products, including the Pixel 4, Stadia, Nest Wifi, Nest Mini, other Nest products, and more.</p>
      <p>While the start and end dates for most of these sales haven’t been shared, we’ll be keeping this post updated with the latest info.</p>
      <h3>Pixel 4 deals are now live</h3>
      <p>Google’s Pixel 4 is $200 off, priced at $599 for the 64GB version and $699 for the 128GB version. Applying this discount to the Pixel 4 XL makes it $699 for the base 64GB version and $799 for the model with 128GB of storage. This deal concludes at the end of Cyber Monday, which takes place on December 2nd.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pixel 4 is $599 at <a href="https://amzn.to/36NspRF">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flearn-about-google-pixel-4%2Fgoogle-pixel-4-shop-by-carrier%2Fpcmcat1570497903420.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1570497903420">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_4">Google Store</a> and <a href="https://fave.co/2X3qmo4">B&amp;H Photo</a></li>
        <li>Pixel 4 XL is $699 at <a href="https://amzn.to/2CCAVoN">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flearn-about-google-pixel-4%2Fshop-by-carrier-google-pixel-4-xl%2Fpcmcat1570498366095.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1570498366095">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_4">Google Store</a> and <a href="https://fave.co/2pSGYT6">B&amp;H Photo</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/7/20954032/black-friday-best-buy-google-pixel-4-xl-deal-sale-unlocked-phone-android-carriers">Best Buy also announced that it will discount the Pixel 4 by $400</a> if you activate it with a carrier, but that deal won’t begin until November 28th.</p>
      <h3>The Pixel 3 is cheaper than usual, too</h3>
      <p>Google’s 2018 Pixel 3 is cheaper than we’ve ever seen at Amazon. <a href="https://amzn.to/2Dmensp">The 64GB version is $349</a> (usually around $449). If performance matters to you, and it’s between this and the slightly cheaper Pixel 3a, definitely pick the Pixel 3. It has a more premium glass build, a faster processor, and dual front-facing speakers. (We’ve been seeing this deal come in and out of stock, so try again a little later if you’re not seeing the right price reflected. Same goes for the Pixel 3 XL below.)</p>
      <p>The Pixel 3 XL is discounted, too, down to $449<a href="https://amzn.to/2QO4dsD"> for the 64GB model</a>. It’s usually around $549, so this is the best price we’ve seen, as well.</p>

      <h3>Pixel 3A deals start on 11/28</h3>
      <p>Starting on Thanksgiving Day, November 28th (and ending as Cyber Monday concludes on Monday, December 2nd), Google’s Pixel 3A and 3A XL will each be $100 off their usual prices at Best Buy, Google Store, Amazon, and B&amp;H Photo.</p>
      <p>This sale brings the starting price for the Pixel 3A down to $299.99. For the Pixel 3A XL, with its bigger screen and battery, you’re looking at a starting price of $379. These phones are commonly $50 off their retail prices, and the best deal before this was when they launched in May; several retailers included $100 gift cards with purchase, but the actual price of the phones didn’t change.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pixel 3A will be $299.99 at <a href="https://amzn.to/34JB8lT">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-pixel-3%2Fgoogle-pixel-3a-shop-by-carrier%2Fpcmcat1556124332800.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1556124332800">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_3a">Google Store</a> and <a href="https://fave.co/33w8Aw7">B&amp;H Photo</a></li>
        <li>Pixel 3A XL will be $379.99 at <a href="https://amzn.to/2qFmmh9">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-pixel-3%2Fgoogle-pixel-3a-xl-shop-by-carrier%2Fpcmcat1556124838576.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1556124838576">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_3a">Google Store</a> and <a href="https://fave.co/32sUH0q">B&amp;H Photo</a></li>

      <h3>Deals starting on 11/28</h3>
      <p>Unless otherwise indicated, all of the deals below will go live on the Google Store starting on Thanksgiving Day. <a href="https://store.google.com/product/stadia">The new Stadia Premiere Edition will come bundled with Nest Wifi (three-pack; one router, two points) for $398</a>. Normally, the Nest Wifi three-pack costs $349, so adding on this Stadia package that includes a controller and a Chromecast Ultra is a good deal if you’re in for the investment.</p>
      <p>If you’re only looking for a single Google Nest Wifi router, <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_wifi?hl=en-US">those will be $20 off</a>, down to $149. Another Nest Wifi deal will be a $40 discount <a href="https://store.google.com/product/nest_wifi">on the Nest Wifi router and point bundle</a>. It usually costs $269, but you’ll be able to pick it up for $229.</p>
      <p><a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_nest_hub">The Nest Hub smart display will be $79</a>, which is a $50 discount off of its retail price. Granted, it doesn’t usually cost that much; $99 is a normal price to pay for this product. If you’re looking for the bigger Nest Hub Max that has a camera, <a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_nest_hub_max">Google is knocking $30 off of that, bringing it down to $199</a>. This is the first official price cut we’ve seen for the Nest Hub Max.</p>
      <p>The new Google Nest Mini smart speaker will be almost half-off of its usual $49 price. <a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_nest_mini">That makes it $29</a>, which is a nice price for this wall-mountable speaker. Other smart speaker discounts include the <a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_home">Google Home going down to $49</a>, its lowest price.</p>
