      <p>Kennedy’s arrest comes just as it emerged that one teenager found dead in the refrigerated lorry container in Essex had <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/teenager-fled-dutch-asylum-shelter-among-39-dead-essex-lorry-11208045/">gone missing from an asylum centre in the Netherlands</a>.</p>
      <p>The country’s Central Agency for the Reception of Asylum Seekers (COA) told local media the teen had run away from a shelter for vulnerable migrants.</p>
      <p>The youngster was among 10 teenagers, including two 15-year-old boys, whose bodies were found in an industrial park in Grays on October 23.</p>
