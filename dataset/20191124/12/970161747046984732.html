      <p>Vinnie Jones has thanked Simon Cowell for helping him with his grief on X Factor: Celebrity following the death of his wife Tanya earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old actor, who <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/left-x-factor-celebrity-last-night-semi-final-11208778/">was voted out of the competition ahead of next week’s hotly-anticipated final</a> alongside Try Star, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/14/vinnie-jones-breaks-tears-recalls-letter-late-wife-tanya-losing-cancer-10912830/">lost his partner Tanya after a long battle with cancer back in July</a>,</p>
      <p>Having previously admitted that<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/25/x-factor-celebrity-vinnie-jones-to-sing-late-wife-tanyas-favourite-songs-as-moving-tribute-to-her-on-live-shows-10981349/"> he’d signed up to the show because his partner was a massive fan</a>, Vinnie heaped praise on Simon after his exit in a heartwarming video message shared on his socials.</p>

      <p>‘Been a fantastic journey, absolutely enjoyed it,’ Vinnie began. ‘Simon, thank you so much for getting me through my grief, helping me a hell of a lot with it.</p>
      <p>‘I will always be indebted to you my friend. Thank you very much.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘All the fans out there, I’ve had a terrific time.’</p>

      <p>In 2013, Vinnie revealed both he and Tanya had melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, and he was later given the all-clear.</p>
      <p>Tanya had also been treated twice for cervical cancer and underwent a heart transplant at 21 following the birth of her daughter Kaley.</p>

      <p>They discovered last Christmas Eve that her cancer had spread to her brain, but she pushed through the festive period while in pain for the benefit of friends and family. She tragically passed away at the family home in Los Angeles surrounded by loved ones in July.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/vinnie-jones-pays-touching-tribute-to-late-wife-tanya-during-live-the-x-factor-celebrity-performance-11072460/">Vinnie paid tribute to Tanya</a> throughout his journey on X Factor: Celebrity by singing her favourite songs.</p>
      <p>He also revealed to <b>Metro.co.uk </b>that he believed Tanya would be ‘singing every word’ with him throughout his performance last night, telling us: ‘She’ll be with me on that stage, I’m sure of it.’</p>

      <p>Sadly Vinnie received the least votes from the public and left the competition yesterday, with just Jenny Ryan, Max and Harvey, V5 and Megan McKenna making it to next week’s final.</p>
