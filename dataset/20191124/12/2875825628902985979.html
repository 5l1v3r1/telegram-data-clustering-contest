      <h1>Jadon Sancho "humiliated" by Borussia Dortmund amid Liverpool and Man Utd transfer links</h1>
      <h2>Earlier this month, manager Lucien Favre hauled Sancho off after just 36 minutes of Dortmund's embarrassing 4-0 defeat by fierce rivals Bayern Munich</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:42:44+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:42</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Jadon Sancho has been left "humiliated and feeling like a scapegoat" by Borussia Dortmund - and is braced for a summer exit to a European giant.</p>
      <p>Sancho, 19, has enjoyed another positive season for struggling Dortmund, chipping in with five goals and nine assists for the Bundesliga giants.</p>
      <p>However this form has been overshadowed by Dortmund's treatment of the player, with the club dropping him for one match and slapping him with a Â£86,000 fine after returning late from duty with England in October.</p>
      <p>And earlier this month, manager Lucien Favre hauled him off after just 36 minutes of Dortmund's embarrassing 4-0 defeat by fierce rivals Bayern Munich.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://theathletic.com/1403402/2019/11/24/exclusive-jadon-sancho-feels-humiliated-and-scapegoated-by-dortmund-amid-interest-from-barcelona-liverpool-united-and-real/?redirected=1">The Athletic</a> , it is the latter that has "left Sancho feeling humiliated, scapegoated and unprotected by his employers."</p>
      <p>It is believed that Sancho feels he is being unfairly treated by the German giants and that he deserves more protection as he is still one of the younger players in the first team.</p>
      <p>The England superstar accepts that pressure comes with his reputation but his representatives are understood to be planning on holding talks with the club over their treating of the winger.</p>
      <p>It is becoming increasingly clear that Sancho, the former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> youngster, will leave the club in a big-money move next summer.</p>

      <p>The Athletic goes on to claim that <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> , <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> are the four European giants who remain interested in signing the talented forward.</p>
      <p>Sancho has not yet made a preference on his next club and is willing to wait until next summer rather than push for a January exit.</p>
      <p>The winger displayed his importance to Dortmund on Friday night by scoring and providing an assist in Dortmund's 3-3 draw with Bundesliga bottom side Paderborn.</p>
      <p>The visitors have only won once in the league so far this season but looked on course for a remarkable victory at Signal Iduna Park as they went in at half-time with a commanding lead - only to leave with a 3-3 draw.</p>
