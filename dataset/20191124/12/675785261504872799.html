      <h1>Made In Chelsea star slams Man Utd’s Brandon Williams and Patrice Evra for girlfriend DMs</h1>
      <h2>Sam Thompson called out the Red Devils pair after contacting Love Island's Zara McDermott through social media site Instagram</h2>

      <p>Manchester United legend <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/patrice-evra">Patrice Evra</a> and current full-back Brandon Williams has incurred the wrath of reality star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sam-thompson">Sam Thompson</a> after being caught contacting the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/made-in-chelsea">Made in Chelsea</a> cast member's girlfriend.</p>
      <p>Thompson is currently dating <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/zara-mcdermott">Zara McDermott</a> who herself shot to fame on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/love-island">Love Island</a> in 2018 and was most recently seen on this year's series of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">The X Factor</a> as part of the band 'No Love Lost'.</p>
      <p>The pair got together earlier this year and have not been shy in sharing a glimpse into their romance with both regularly uploading pictures of the other to their social media accounts.</p>
      <p>Despite having a boyfriend, it seems McDermott does not remain short of admirers with Evra and Williams apparently contacting her on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>

      <p>And Thompson decided to take the pair to task over their actions, though did do it with good humour.</p>
      <p>"I've always dreamed of talking to footballers, but no one ever replies to me. The only way I can talk to them is through my girlfriend's phone on the DMs," said Thompson in a clip on his own Instagram account on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>"We've got Brandon Williams today who is actually sick and got his debut, congratulations Brandon. Little eye emoji, yes boy. Love that, classic stuff.</p>

      <p>"We've got Patrice Evra on there who's like a hero of mine and who I absolutely love. He's sent one of those things where he says 'I love this game'. Why don't they reply to me, but slide into her DMs? I'm just as good."</p>
      <p>Made in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> star Thompson then went on to finish the clip by making a joking plea to players of a club far closing to his hometown to get in contact.</p>

      <p>"It's always Man United, but where are the Chelsea boys? Mason Mount, slide in. Or Tammy Abraham, you're my hero, come on," he added.</p>
      <p>Former Utd full-back Evra married wife Sandra in 2007 and the pair have two children together.</p>
