        <b>Deontay Wilder retained his WBC heavyweight championship on Saturday night as he impressively defeated Luis Ortiz via knockout in the seventh round of their title fight in Las Vegas.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wilder had been struggling against his experienced opponent losing the first six rounds, but The Bronze Bomber has shown so often in the past that he only requires one shot to win a fight and it came in the closing seconds of the seventh.</p>
      <p>The unbeaten fighter struck what was arguably his first meaningful punch of the fight as he dropped Ortiz who was unable to answer the referee’s count.</p>

      <p>Wilder now takes his record to 42-0-1 with his one draw coming<a href="https://punditarena.com/boxing/ccunningham/deontay-wilder-tyson-fury-go-to-war-in-thrilling-split-decision-draw/"> in last year’s epic battle</a> with Tyson Fury and speaking following the victory, <a href="https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11868782/deontay-wilder-knocks-out-luis-ortiz-in-wbc-heavyweight-championship-rematch">he told Sky Sports</a> that he is eyeing a rematch before a potential unification fight with Anthony Joshua or Andy Ruiz Jr.</p>
      <p>“I had to calculate Ortiz perfectly, he’s very dangerous in that ring as you can see, that’s why no other heavyweight wanted to give him the opportunity. He’s very smart</p>
      <p>“Once I got him I set him up and that was the shot. I always say these guys have to be perfect for 12 rounds, I only have to be perfect for two seconds and each and every time I’ve proved that.</p>

      <p>“Tyson Fury is definitely next and then after that I want a unification bout with whoever wins between (Anthony) Joshua and (Andy) Ruiz Jr.</p>
      <p>“Right now we’re ready for Tyson Fury. Hopefully he’s ready for me, I know his trainer’s here so I hope he got some notes down. I’m ready to go at any given time and any given moment and February is looking like our time.”</p>
