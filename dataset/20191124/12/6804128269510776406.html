      <h1>Gary Lineker slams VAR after Raheem Sterling's disallowed goal for Man City against Chelsea</h1>
      <h2>The Manchester City winger saw a goal chalked off</h2>

      <p>Gary Lineker has criticised VAR after another weekend of high profile decisions made in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Manchester City beat Chelsea 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium, but Pep Guardiola's side had a third goal ruled out for offside.</p>
      <p>N'Golo Kante scored to give Frank Lampard's Blues the lead in the first half, but Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez both netted to turn the game on its head.</p>
      <p>Raheem Sterling thought he made the game safe for City when he poked home in injury time, but the effort was disallowed after VAR ruled that Sterling was offside when the ball was headed forward to him.</p>
      <p>The ruling was by the narrowest of margins, with TV replays showing Sterling may actually have been level.</p>
      <p>Sterling took to social media after the game, writing: "Happy to improve my VAR overruled goals record today again. Damn this thing gonna kill me bro #cursed."</p>
      <p>Lineker also tweeted during the game to question the decision.</p>

      <p>Speaking after the game, Chelsea boss Frank Lampard was asked if he could take heart from his team's performance against the champions.</p>
      <p>"Maybe it is not the critical factor, but coming into the game in our recent form and developing quickly, I wanted us to come here and be brave. Be brave on the ball and off it and I think that you saw that from us today.</p>
      <p>"At 1-0 we had a relative control of the game. Of course when you are here it can never last. They had a couple of moments, but we were playing well and throughout the game there were a lot of positives.</p>
      <p>"At this level maybe it shows that the finer details in the boxes, both boxes decide these ones."</p>
