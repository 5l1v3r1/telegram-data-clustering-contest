        <b>Arsenal legend Tony Adams slammed the club’s performance against Southampton and feels that they aren’t progressing under Emery.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Gunners slipped to 7th in the league table after their 2-2 draw against the Saints. Two goals from Alexandre Lacazette helped them salvage a point after being trailing twice. Many Arsenal fans booed the team after the final whistle was blown.</p>

      <p>Adams called the Gunners’ performance terrible and felt that they deserved the boos. As quoted by <a href="https://talksport.com/football/633924/arsenal-unai-emery-southampton/">talkSPORT</a>, the former Gunners captain told BT Sport: “I’m just smashed to bits with the performance. At one point Ozil was sweeper, getting the ball off his keeper and trying to run it through everybody. The boos are deserved – it was a terrible, terrible performance, very disjointed, no defending in sight. That’s a really poor performance and I don’t want any coach losing his job, but the club’s not going forward, it’s not progressing.</p>
      <p>“I can put a team together that’s more organised than that!. They’re all sleeping, look at Luiz here. What is Luiz doing? He’s just standing there.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal’s performance was pretty disappointing yesterday and they need to turn things around quickly if they are to stand a chance of finishing in the top four this season. If their performances don’t improve soon, then there’s a good chance of Emery getting sacked.</p>
      <p>The Gunners’ next match is in the Europa League against Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday before playing Norwich City at Carrow Road next weekend.</p>
