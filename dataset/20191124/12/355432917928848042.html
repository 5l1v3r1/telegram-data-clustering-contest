      <h1>Stefanik: The left is 'spun up' after her impeachment hearing performance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:00:16+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Marty Johnson</a></address>
      <p>In an interview with radio talk show host John Catsimatidis, Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/elise-stefanik">Elise Stefanik</a> (R-N.Y.) said that Democrats are "spun up" after her performance during the public impeachment hearings.</p>
      <p>"I was focused on the facts and the substance in my questions of witnesses as part of these impeachment hearings," the House Intelligence Committee member told Catsimatidis.</p>
      <p>"But obviously the left and Hollywood liberals got spun up," she added. "They have been pouring millions to support my far-left opponent all because I spoke on behalf of my constituents and I asked very strong questions."</p>
      <p>Stefanik, 35, was referring to Tedra Cobb, who is challenging Stefanik for New York's 21st District seat. Last weekend, Cobb's campaign reported that it received more than $1 million in donations after the first set of impeachment hearings.</p>
      <p>During former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine <a href="https://thehill.com/people/marie-yovanovitch">Marie Yovanovitch</a>'s hearing, House Intelligence Committee ranking member <a href="https://thehill.com/people/devin-nunes">Devin Nunes</a> (R-Calif.) tried to turn the microphone over to Stefanik rather than GOP counsel. The move wasn't in accordance with the House impeachment proceedings' hearing rules, so House Intelligence Committee Chairman <a href="https://thehill.com/people/adam-schiff">Adam Schiff</a> (D-Calif.) gaveled her down.</p>
      <p>The incident caused Stefanik to be <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/470811-trump-labels-stefanik-a-new-republican-star">lauded by fellow Republicans</a> but lambasted by Democrats.</p>

      <p>"Adam Schiff made up these partisan rules that don’t allow members to yield their time to other members," Stefanik continued in the interview.</p>
      <p>"This is unprecedented. It doesn’t happen in any other committee. It doesn’t even happen in the Intelligence Committee under normal rules."</p>
      <p>Stefanik also criticized the left for continuing to "pursue impeachment regardless of the facts."</p>
      <p>"This week there was not a single witness that had direct evidence of a quid pro quo or any impeachable crime," she asserted.</p>
