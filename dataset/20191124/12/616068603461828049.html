      <p>As the winter creeps in and fireplaces are more commonly used, the provincial government is reminding residents to ensure they have the correct permits for firewood use, including cutting or collecting firewood on eligible Crown land. </p>
      <p>Cutting down trees or collecting firewood on Crown land without the right permit is illegal and can result in added safety hazards for forest users or negatively affect wildlife ecosystems.</p>
      <p>To collect and transport firewood for personal use from Crown land, a Free Use Permit for Firewood is needed. This permit does not apply to cutting or collecting wood on private land or on a First Nations reserve. </p>
      <p>Permit holders do not have to pay to collect wood, but must carry the permit at all times and have it ready to show an officer if necessary. </p>
      <p>For each natural resource district, the permit describes where residents are allowed to collect firewood from, appropriate methods of collection and how much can be taken. </p>
      <p>Permits can be obtained via the <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/natural-resource-use/natural-resource-permits/firewood-permits">online application form</a> or in person at a local natural resource district office.</p>
      <p>Anyone who wishes to notify the ministry's Compliance and Enforcement Branch about possible illegal wood collecting activities can call the natural resource violations reporting line toll-free at 1 877 952-7277 (or #7277 on a cellphone), or <a href="http://www.gov.bc.ca/nrv">submit a report online</a>.</p>
