      <h1>Safety fears after body discovered near I'm A Celebrity campsite</h1>
      <h2>The campsite is in lockdown</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:15:36+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author">Kyle O'Sullivan, Alexander Brock</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity's</a> campsite is in lockdown after a body was found nearby by a horrified couple.</p>
      <p>The discovery has sparked a massive police hunt and members of the Homicide Squad are conducting a canvass of the surrounding area.</p>
      <p>The man's body was found in a sleeping bag at Jack Evans Boat Harbour Park on Friday morning (November 22), <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/im-celebrity-lockdown-killer-loose-20947359">Mirror Online reports</a> .</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Brendon Cullen revealed the man was found with "physical wounds".</p>
      <p>The area is just over an hour away from the production site and sources have told  <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10409277/im-a-celeb-security-hunt-killer/">The Sun</a>  that I'm A Celeb bosses have tightened up security.</p>

      <p>One said: “The celebs are being watched 24 hours a day, seven days a week by a team of staff and our security measures are incredibly tight.</p>
      <p>“So there is zero chance of anyone sneaking into camp. But of course it is very unsettling to know that there is someone out there, running from the police, who has committed such a horrible crime.”</p>
      <p>New South Wales police has confirmed that officers are treating the death of the man, believed to be in his 50s, as suspicious.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Brendon Cullen told  <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-22/tweed-heads-body-found-in-sleeping-bag/11730258">ABC</a>: "The movements and the history of the victim is something that we are in the early stages of establishing.</p>
      <p>"We are very keen to speak to any person that was in Jack Evans Boat Harbour yesterday evening and this morning who might have seen something or know anything about this.</p>
      <p>"We do want to establish where this man is from and how he came to be in the state he is in now."</p>
      <p>The celebrities in the camp have no contact with the outside world and are therefore unaware of the police manhunt.</p>
