      <p>Mitie is suing the Ministry of Justice over what is claims was a botched tendering process for a contract to clean and repair courts and tribunal buildings.</p>
      <p>The outsourcing giant has lodged a High Court claim after losing the contract to French rival Engie last month.</p>

      <p>Mitie is set to argue that the government took an “unfair and unequal” approach to scoring during the tender and awarded scores that were “manifestly wrong”, the Sunday Times reported.</p>
      <p>The company is hoping to claim over £200,000 damages from the government and is calling for Engie to be stripped of the contract.</p>
      <p>“This was a rigorous and comprehensive 12-month procurement process which followed EU rules,” said an HM Courts and Tribunals spokesperson.</p>
      <p>“At the upcoming court hearing we will be robustly defending our position.”</p>
      <p>Shares in Mitie slumped eight per cent on Thursday after the outsourcer warned that clients are currently reluctant to commit to new projects amid ongoing political uncertainty.</p>
