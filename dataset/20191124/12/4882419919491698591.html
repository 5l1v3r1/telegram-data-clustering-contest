      <p>Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane said that Gareth Bale is "focused on his job" after the Welshman was whistled by his own supporters during Saturday's 3-1 win over Real Sociedad.</p>
      <p>Bale came on for Rodrygo Goes in the second half and was not given a pleasant reception by Madrid fans following his antics with Wales. After saying it was more exciting to play with his national team, he celebrated qualification for Euro 2020 in front of a banner which read: 'Wales, golf, Madrid. In that order.'</p>
      <p>"I don't want to opine," Varane told Movistar. "The good thing is that he looked good on the pitch when he came on, focused on the game and focused on his job."</p>
      <p>On the game, which Madrid came from behind to win, Varane added: "With patience and playing our football, we improved as the game went on.</p>
      <p>"It's a good result. (Coach Zinedine ) Zidane told us at half time we would have to start the second half how we ended the first, playing in their half and defending together."</p>
      <p>Madrid's win took them on to 28 points, level with Barcelona at the top of the Spanish Primera Division.</p>
