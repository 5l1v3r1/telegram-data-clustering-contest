          <p>The match between Chivas Guadalajara and Veracruz was of utter importance to both sides. Chivas could still make the play-off if they won the match and if other results went their way. Veracruz was also playing not knowing if they would return next season.</p>

                <p>It has been widely reported that the other 18 club owners have allowed Veracruz owner Fidel Kuri to step away from Mexican football thereby dissolving the club. One of their defenders Carlos Salcido, was also playing his retirement match and the club would have surely wanted to bow out with a win.</p>
                <p>Chiva’s on the other hand, were also playing their first match after the death of owner Jorge Vergara last friday in New York City. With so much significance in the match for both sides, the two clubs played an exciting match. in the end however, Tono Rodriguez swung the match in his sides favour by providing an absolute moment of maddening brilliance.</p>

                      <p>By the end of the first half Veracruz lead the match 1-0. However, Alan Pulido scored twice to put Chivas ahead. With the match in its dying minutes, Veracruz crowded Chivas’ penalty box as they hunted for the equaliser. This would prove to be their undoing as keeper Tono Rodriguez seeing an empty net decided to go for gold and get it.</p>

                            <p>Rodriguez had but one good look. He had to hit it with power and make sure that the trajectory remained straight. In the end, everything fell into place and Chivas had sealed their victory. Rodriguez would later dedicate the goal to the late Jorge Vergara.</p>

                            <p>In the end though, both sides failed to achieve what they had sought. Veracruz have probably bowed out of Mexican football with a loss. Chivas on the other hand, have failed to qualify for the play-offs after Pachuca and Monterrey won their respective matches. However, both sides left the field with their heads held high after 90+ minutes of exciting football.</p>
