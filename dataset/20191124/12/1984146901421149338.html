      <h1>Bungling Durham and Northumberland prison staff released NINE inmates by mistake</h1>
      <h2>The inmates were all wrongly set free between January 2015 and March 2019 but were later returned to jail</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sonia Sharma</a></address>
      <p>Bungling officials released nine prisoners from North East jails by mistake, new figures have shown.</p>
      <p>The offenders were serving sentences at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/hmp-durham">HMP Durham</a> and HMP Northumberland but were wrongly set free between January 2015 and March 2019.</p>
      <p>The figures, obtained through a Freedom of Information request, show that eight people were released from the Durham prison - three in 2015, three more in 2016 and two in the following year.</p>
      <p>The inmates had been serving time for crimes including sexual offences, theft, possession of weapons, and violence.</p>
      <p>One prisoner was released in error from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/hmp-northumberland-1">HMP Northumberland</a>, in 2017.</p>
      <p>However, the MoJ was unable to provide information about the type of offence the inmate was serving a sentence for.</p>
      <p>The MoJ runs HMP Durham, while Sodexo runs the Northumberland prison.</p>
      <p>The MoJ's Prison Service says it thoroughly investigates every incident to see what lessons can be learnt to help prevent further such errors.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson added: "Releases in error are very rare but we take them extremely seriously and work closely with police to bring offenders back into custody quickly."</p>
      <p>According to the figures, there were no prisoners released by mistake at HMP Deerbolt, HMP Frankland and HMP Low Newton between 2015 and 2019.</p>
      <p>HMP Durham, based in Elvet, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/county-durham">County Durham</a>, is a reception prison serving the courts in the Newcastle, Durham, Teesside and Cumbria area.</p>
      <p>As of February 2017, it has been able to hold up to 996 prisoners.</p>
      <p>The facility has seven wings as well as segregation cells and healthcare areas.</p>
      <p>HMP NorthumberlandÂ  is a category C jail. It was transferred to the management of Sodexo in December 2013.</p>
