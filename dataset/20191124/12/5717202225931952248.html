      <h1>Report: Arsenal draw up three-man shortlist to replace Unai Emery, including Pochettino</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:56:43+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7719969/Arsenal-start-process-identifying-Unai-Emerys-successor-amid-growing-boardroom-dissatisfaction.html">The Daily Mail have claimed</a> that the Arsenal board are begining to get fed up of Unai Emery’s tenure and have drawn up a three-man shortlist to find the Spaniard’s long-term replacement at The Emirates.</p>
      <p>Arsenal went five league games without a win on Saturday as they failed to beat Southampton at The Emirates. Indeed, Alexandre Lacazette’s 96th-minute equaliser saw them save a point against Ralph Hasenhuttl’s lowly side.</p>
      <p>The report claims that head of football Raul Sanllehi and technical director Edu are keen to keep Emery, and give him the chance to improve things. But the Gunners board are not impressed and are drawing up a shortlist to replace Emery.</p>
      <p>Max Allegri is one of those three, after an excellent stint at Juventus. Man City assistant and ex-Arsenal skipper Mikel Arteta is also an option, as is Mauricio Pochettino despite his sacking from Tottenham. The latter, though, is described as ‘remote’.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are not keen on the idea of replacing Emery midway through the season ,and it is believed a combination of Freddie Ljungberg and Steve Bould could come in if Emery is not trusted until the summer.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Pochettino, Allegri or Arteta?</h3>
      <p>The chances of Pochettino moving to Arsenal is unlikely. The Argentine has spoke in the past as saying that the one club he would never join is Arsenal, given his five-year spell at their closest rivals in Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Allegri is an excellent option and has a stunning record from his time at Juventus. The question surrounding Allegri is whether the Italian would go to Arsenal. The Gunners face competition from Napoli, with Carlo Ancelotti under pressure.</p>
      <p>Arteta knows what it means to Arsenal fans and has been working as an understudy to the best in the business. Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard have shown experience in management is not required – so Arteta is probably Arsenal’s best bet.</p>
