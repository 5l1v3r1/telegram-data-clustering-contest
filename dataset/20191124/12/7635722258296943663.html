      <h1>Jon Rahm wins DP World Tour Championship and $2m Race to Dubai prize</h1>

        <b>Spain's Jon Rahm has won the season-ending DP World Tour Championship, and along with it the lucrative Race to Dubai prize.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 25-year-old birdied the eighteenth to finish on nineteen under par and beat European Ryder Cup teammate Tommy Fleetwood by a single shot.</p>
      <p>Fleetwood had an incredible final day, shooting a seven-under-par 65 to force Rahm into having to at least par the last for a play-off.</p>
      <p>The Englishman had produced a stunning fightback that included five birdies in the last seven holes.</p>
      <p>The result means Rahm wins the $2 million bonus prize for the Race to Dubai, as well as the $3 million for the tournament win itself. He is only the second Spanish golfer to win the Race to Dubai, after the late Seve Ballesteros. The latter won the prestigious prize six times over the course of his career.</p>
      <p>Rahm was in the red all week, after rounds of 66, 69, 66, and 68. He now finishes as the top-ranked golfer on the European Tour this year and moves up to number 3 in the world rankings for good measure.</p>
      <p>Austrian Bernd Wiesberger had led the way in the Race to Dubai before the action got underway on Thursday. However, he ended back in 28th place on two under par.</p>

      <p>Rory McIlroy finished in fourth on 12-under-par after the Down man shot a one-over final 73. That added to his solid tournament after previous rounds of 64, 74, and 65.</p>
      <p>Open champion Shane Lowry ended on 7 under par for the tournament after shooting a two-under final round of 70.</p>
      <p>That left the Offaly man in a tie for twelfth position - he had been in with an outside chance of the Race to Dubai title before the action got underway at the Jumeirah Golf Estates.</p>
      <p>Rahm was elated after his stunning victory had been secured today.</p>
      <p>"I feel like I'm going to start crying," <a href="https://www.skysports.com/golf/live-blog/12176/11868855/dp-world-tour-championship-live-updates-from-race-to-dubai-finale">Rahm told Sky Sports</a>. "Man, it was such an up-and-down day.</p>
      <p>"(On the) eighth tee I had a six-shot lead and I came down 18 needing a birdie to win. It was hard, I kind of lost the swing a little bit.</p>
      <p>"It's hard to believe that besides the putt, the first three shots on 18 is about as calm as I've been all day because I told myself on 18, 'How many times do you dream of having to birdie the last hole to win a tournament?'.</p>
      <p>"I hit the best drive of the week, a great four iron that the wind didn't take, an outstanding bunker shot and I made the putt."</p>
