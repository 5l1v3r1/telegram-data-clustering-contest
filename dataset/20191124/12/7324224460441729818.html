      <p>Gavin And Stacey star Ruth Jones switched on Barry town’s Christmas lights, dressed as her character from the much-loved series.</p>
      <p>“Nessa” returned to her old stomping ground and was the special guest at the annual Christmas lights ceremony in King Square.</p>
      <p>The star walked out on stage dressed in a classic Nessa outfit with short black hair.</p>
      <p>The switch-on was hosted by local radio station Bro Radio, which captured the moment on camera.</p>
      <p>Addressing the crowd in character, she shouted: “Ow, what’s occurin’?</p>
      <p>“Cracking to see you all tonight… have you got nothing better to do?</p>
      <p>“Oh, there’s some lookers out here tonight, a few exes in the crowd here I can see.”</p>
