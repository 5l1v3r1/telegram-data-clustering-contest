      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/pmco-fall-split-south-asia-2019-finals">PMCO Fall Split 2019</a> Prelims for Global Finals are being held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The 10th match of Prelims Day 2 took place in the map Erangel, from a third-person perspective. The flight path for this match started from the north part of the map and went towards the south-west part of the map. The first play-zone formed near the near side of the map, and it circled hot-priority locations such as Rozhok, Stalbar, and Zharki.</p>

      <p>SynerGE and Asterion dropped in Zharki setting up for an early team fight. SynerGE secured the first kill which forced Asterion to flee from the scene. The two Indian giants SynerGE and INS clashed near the ridge where INS landed the initial blow by eliminating Majoralpha. Even though SynerGE lost a member, they outsmarted INS securing two kills in return. However, GoSkilla joined the battle, making it a triple threat. SynerGE was wiped out in the chaos while GoSkilla and INS retaliated from the scene. Mega Esports, Red Canids and Bigetron made it to the last zone where Mega Esports had a 3 man advantage on both the teams. This was enough for Mega Esports to secure its fourth Chicken Dinner of PMCO Fall Split Prelims.</p>
