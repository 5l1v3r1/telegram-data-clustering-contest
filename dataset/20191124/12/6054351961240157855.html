      <p><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.27699/title.mike-will-made-it-scott-storch-bink-describe-production-on-rick-ross-mastermind">Bink</a> sought to get his just due for creating <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53506/title.kanye-west-grabs-dr-dre-for-jesus-is-king-sequel">Kanye West’s</a> “Devil In A New Dress” beat while fans celebrated the track on social media. But the veteran producer’s search for proper recognition led to a full-fledged Twitter beef with <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.45394/title.mike-dean-working-on-new-tunes-with-kanye-west-travis-scott-desiigner">Mike Dean</a>, the other man responsible for the song’s production.</p>
      <p>“Why these people insist on leaving me out of my own shit is plain disrespectful!” Bink wrote on Friday (November 22). “Thank you for noticing!”</p>
      <p>But that same day, Dean commented, “I made the whole section.” After seeing this, Bink went off on Saturday (November 23).</p>
      <p>“This whole section is based off wtf was already there mf!” he fired back at Dean. “You were merely a fucking musician on this shit plus I didn’t put u on the record you forced ya self in the mix! I don’t need u or ye to finish none of my shit! Foh lame.”</p>

      <p>Bink continued venting on Twitter, sparking a back-and-forth exchange with Dean.</p>
      <p>“These mfs wanna give Kanye and @therealmikedean all the credit for MY CREATION so bad!!!” he wrote. “find one more record like that in either one of their catalogs!! I’ll wait!!”</p>
      <p>Dean replied, “Bink u def killed the beat. Get outta here! I see u mentioned a lot. But I did take it to another dimension with the switch up.”</p>
      <p>Bink tweeted, “Fuck you! To all these stupid ass platforms that left me out of my record for the 9th year in a row! No excuse!! Plain disrespectful! @therealmikedean has never done anything like this in his career BY HIMSELF!”</p>
      <p>Dean responded, “Why the hate. U never did anything like that by yourself either fam. It’s magic. Like we said when we met up with ross.”</p>

      <p>As the conversation progressed, the producers became more heated.</p>
      <p>“Amazing how u sit up here and accept the credit for my fucking record and not correct the people @therealmikedean well I’m a do it for you!” Bink declared.</p>
      <p>Dean fired back, “Also to be honest since your being assholish. The switch up and is the thing that makes the beat does y’all. Besides that it’s a sample with some drums. Oh ya I played the bassline over the sample throughout too. The things I wake up to and the disrespect is real.”</p>
      <p>He added, “On what. I did the bassline.layered strings they shole@song . And evisioned created and played every instrument u hear in the breakdown not to mention mixed it. Song would be a flat sample loop throughout with some Kontakt drums over them without me. Get real folks. We all magi.”</p>
      <p>Bink didn’t take the comment lightly, blasting the song’s mixing and calling Dean a liar.</p>
      <p>“Mix was HORRIBLE!!” he wrote. “I’ve always said that!!! My 2track fucks your entire mix up! You replaying what i already had ain’t writing mf! You don’t get down like me period!! Your ye’s boy period! I didn’t and don’t need u on my shit! Ya lame ass lying.”</p>

      <p>Amid the exchanges, the two producers argued and debated with fans on Twitter. Dean appeared to downplay Bink’s work, claiming the beat wouldn’t have made the cut on<i> My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i> without the involvement of Kanye’s longtime engineer.</p>
      <p>As the arguments rolled on, the bickering between the two didn’t ease up and eventually spilled over into Sunday (November 24) as Bink reacted to some of Dean’s other remarks.</p>

      <p>Bink deleted a tweet that Dean claimed was “going racial” but had plenty more to say about his “Devil In A New Dress” co-producer.</p>
      <p>“Your new name is Mr.Overdubb!!” Bink told Dean. “Foh pill head! I know u stay fucked up half the time so ya lame ass forgot who da fuck your talking to! I will mop the floor with u producing mf! Fuck u talking too.”</p>
      <p>Dean directly responded to Bink’s apparent issue with the changes made to his beat by noting, “It’s Kanye album not yours. What happens to songs is his call.”</p>
      <p>Bink chimed in, “And the lie detector test saids that too is a lie sir!! enjoy ya Sunday champ.”</p>
      <p>The Grammy-winning producer also took one more shot at Dean to wrap up the Twitter saga.</p>
      <p>“This FOSSIL actually said out of his nasty ass mouth that i never did a track like devil in a new dress without him!” he wrote. “Picture that! Where da fuck u think that whole style came from? You? Christopher Columbus ass mf! You ain’t discovered shit either.”</p>
