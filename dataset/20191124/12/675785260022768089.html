      <h2>The touching moment colour blind pupil Jonathan Jones from Minnesota saw colours for the first time was filmed and uploaded online, leading to a flood of donations to enable his family to help others</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T12:40:21+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 12:40</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>A young student is unable to hold back the tears after a kind gesture from his school principal allowed him to see colours for the first time.</p>
      <p>The touching moment was filmed and uploaded online, showing colour blind pupil Jonathan Jones sitting in a class as they learn about the colour vision deficiency.</p>
      <p>Jonathan's principal then surprises him by handing over a pair of glasses at the school in Minnesota, telling him 'they're all yours'.</p>
      <p>As Jonathan swaps the glasses for his own, the youngster is taken aback as the room is instantly transformed into colour.</p>
      <p>A huge grin spreads from ear-to-ear, and as his principal asks what he thinks of the glasses, he is only able to nod and give a thumbs up as he becomes overwhelmed and breaks down in tears.</p>

      <p>The two then share an emotional hug before Jonathan collects himself to wander round the classroom taking in the colours he has never seen before.</p>
      <p>Almost 130,000 people were moved by the video after it was <a href="https://twitter.com/BenJones_5/status/1197599034841518080">uploaded on Twitter</a> by Jonathan's brother Ben.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "This is just a great example of the huge impact that teachers can have on kids.</p>
      <p>"We need to pay our teachers more; they more than deserve it.</p>

      <p>"My mom started up a GoFundMe to get my brother his own pair so he can start seeing the world in color.</p>
      <p>"Any excess funds will go to the Enchroma Foundation who provide these glasses to those in need."</p>
      <p>On the donations page, Jonathan's mum Carole says: "After posting a video on social media of Jonathan seeing color for the first time, we have been overwhelmed by how many kind, generous people have wanted to help him get a pair of his own color blind glasses.</p>
      <p>"We will use these funds to purchase his own pair and donate any additional funds to a foundation who purchases color blind glasses for those who can't afford them.</p>
      <p>"Thank you all for your love and compassion. We are overwhelmed and encouraged to know there are so many amazing people in this world who would help a young man they have never met."</p>

      <p>The original target of around £270 was blown out of the water, with the total raised currently sitting at more than £17,000.</p>
      <p>Carole added an update to say the family have been blown away by the support and announced that Enchroma had vowed to match every pair of glasses bought with the money, doubling the number of people they will be able to help.</p>
      <p>She added that 100% of donations will go directly to funding new glasses, with any other costs being covered from other sources.</p>
      <p>The whole story became a bit too much for handle for those on social media, with one writing: "I'm crying right now. This is the sweetest video."</p>
      <p>Another said: "As someone who is colorblind, this hit hard."</p>
      <p>In another brilliant twist, an opticians replied to say: "It looks like he will need a prescription, since he already wears glasses.</p>
      <p>"Heavyglare Eyewear is a the first distributer of the Enchroma products in Minnesota and we can make them in his prescription."</p>
