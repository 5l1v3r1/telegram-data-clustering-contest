      <p>A few weeks ago, <a href="https://www.sohh.com/suge-knights-son-reacts-to-reports-claiming-dad-sold-life-rights-to-ray-j/">reports emerged claiming</a> R&amp;B singer <b>Ray J</b> might have landed Knight’s life rights.</p>
      <blockquote>Sources close to Knight told TMZ he sold away his life rights to Ray J, allowing the “One Wish” musician to handle Knight’s business decisions while he’s otherwise occupied in prison. Ray J will reportedly be in charge of selecting any possible biopics or biographies about or involving Knight. This means Ray J is in the position to give the go-ahead on any projects involving Knight’s likeness or life story, offering the former music executive the opportunity to bring in some cash. (Complex)</blockquote>
      <p>Reports also claimed <a href="https://www.sohh.com/suge-knights-son-reacts-to-reports-claiming-dad-sold-life-rights-to-ray-j/">there is at least one film project</a> in the works connected to Knight.</p>
      <blockquote>Sources have indicated a documentary on Death Row Records and Suge is already underway, and there’s even the chance the label itself could make a return after closing its doors in 2009. Another unspecified project focused on the life of 2Pac is in discussion, too. (Complex)</blockquote>
      <p>Last year, Knight <a href="https://www.sohh.com/suge-knight-has-a-new-home-to-start-28-year-prison-bid/">received nearly 30 years</a> in prison for his involvement in a fatal hit-and-run.</p>
      <blockquote>Former rap mogul Marion “Suge” Knight was formally sentenced on Thursday to 28 years in prison for a 2015 hit and run that left one man dead and another man injured. The 53-year-old former producer and co-founder of gangsta rap label Death Row Records last month pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter for businessman Terry Carter’s death in Compton, California.
