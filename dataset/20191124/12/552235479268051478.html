      <h2>The Ibrox legend was baffled by the winger's socks and flip flops and wasn't shy in pointing it out.</h2>

      <p>Ally McCoist left <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/chris-sutton">Chris Sutton</a> in stitches as he roasted Ryan Kent's dodgy socks and flip flops combo.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> star sat down for a BT Sport interview ahead of scoring a stunner during Sunday's 3-1 win over Hamilton and his choice of footwear left McCoist baffled.</p>
      <p>Kent wore white socks over said flip flops and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ally-mccoist">McCoist</a> 's lighthearted quip prompted Celtic legend Sutton to burst out laughing.</p>
      <p>"Listen, he's an excellent player, no doubt about it.</p>
      <p>"The only mistake he's made so far is those white socks with the flip flops.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what was going on there, frankly, to be honest with you.</p>
      <p>"He's been Rangers key player, when he plays. I spoke to Gary McAllister about him and he's loving his football.</p>
      <p>"He loves the club, the fans and he just feels loved. I think it's evident in his performances.</p>
      <p>"On his game, he can twist, turn and create chances - and he can finish.</p>
      <p>"We speak about Morelos and clearly he's the key player for Rangers but not for behind him, for me, would be <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-kent">Ryan Kent</a> ."</p>
