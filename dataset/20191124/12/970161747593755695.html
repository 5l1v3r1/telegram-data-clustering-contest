      <p>The weather is going to be dreadful in the UK over the next week with the Met Office issuing flood and ‘danger to life’ warnings.</p>
      <p>South-West England and South Wales are preparing for heavy downpours over the coming days – with yellow weather warnings in place in the region from today until Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The East Midlands and South Yorkshire are also expecting a deluge by midweek, on top of the ground already flooded earlier this month.</p>
      <p>A yellow warning has been issued for this region and there is also the possibility of flooding.</p>

      <p>Met Office weather forecaster Alex Burkill said: ‘Across the next five days we have got warnings for each [day].</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘[On Wednesday] it’s covering that area of Yorkshire and Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, that area which saw the severe flooding.</p>
      <p>‘At the moment, the rainfall is not expected to be particularly heavy for the time of year, but we are expecting it to be significant.</p>
      <p>‘There are likely to be some impacts.’</p>
      <p>A month’s worth of rain fell in the South-West and North-East of England on Saturday causing flash floods.</p>
      <p>Firefighters in Devon and Cornwall warned drivers to stay away from flooded roads after a number of calls overnight to stranded cars.</p>
      <p>Images showed areas such as Clyst St Mary in Exeter after they had suffered flash flooding.</p>

      <p>The yellow weather warning in East Midlands and Yorkshire &amp; Humber for Wednesday came accompanied with a ‘danger to life’ caution.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the Army was called in to assist stricken communities after towns and villages around Doncaster and Sheffield and parts of the Midlands suffered flooding after heavy downpours.</p>
      <p>Doncaster Council said more than 900 homes and businesses in the town were affected by the rain earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Seven flood warnings were in place across England and Wales on Saturday, alongside 60 less severe flood alerts.</p>
