      <p><b>New Delhi:</b> Remaining silent for nearly 36 hours after being sworn-in as the deputy CM of Maharashtra, Ajit Pawar on Sunday gave a new twist to this association with the NCP and said he is still with the party and Sharad Pawar remains his party leader.</p>
      <p>“I am in the NCP and shall always be in the NCP and @PawarSpeaks Saheb is our leader,” he said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>He also said in the same tweet that the BJP-NCP will give a stable government to Maharashtra which was under President’s Rule for nearly a month after no party came forward to prove the majority to form the government in the state.</p>
      <p>“Our BJP-NCP alliance shall provide a stable government in Maharashtra for the next five years which will work sincerely for the welfare of the state and its people,” he added.</p>
      <p>Notably, the deputy CM of Maharashtra was sacked from the NCP after he extended support to the BJP to form the government in the state.</p>
      <p>In another tweet, he assured all not to worry for anything as all is well and said it needs little patience.</p>
      <p>“There is absolutely no need to worry, all is well. However a little patience is required. Thank you very much for all your support,” he said in another tweet.</p>
