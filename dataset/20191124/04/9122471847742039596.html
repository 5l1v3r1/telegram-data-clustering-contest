      <h1>Coach O Has Brutally Honest Comment About Arkansas Following Win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:10:28+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>LSU notched its 11th win of the regular season tonight, as the Tigers blew out Arkansas, 56-20, at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge.</p>
      <p>There were no big celebrations for LSU following tonight’s win. It was business as usual for the Tigers, who have bigger things to accomplish than a home win over the Razorbacks.</p>
      <p>LSU head coach Ed Orgeron went further into detail about the lack of a celebration.</p>
      <p>He did not hold back.</p>
      <p>“There wasn’t going to be celebration for beating Arkansas, they haven’t beaten anyone in a long time,” Coach O told reporters.</p>

      <p>Welp, he’s not wrong.</p>
      <p>Arkansas is 2-9 on the season, winless in the SEC. The Razorbacks are not even close to being at the same level as LSU right now. The spread for this game was 50-something points, after all.</p>
      <p>LSU will look to finish the regular season at 12-0 next weekend against Texas A&amp;M.</p>
