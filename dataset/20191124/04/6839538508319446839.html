      <p>Veteran Perth broadcaster Paul Shepherd admits he’s an “idiot” for not taking bowel cancer tests seriously — but he says he hopes his shock diagnosis will make others take screening seriously.</p>
      <p>The team at Mix 94.5 have been flooded with more than 600 messages from listeners who did their free at-home bowel cancer screening test, after hearing of their beloved “Cap’n” Paul’s diagnosis.</p>
      <p>Shepherd, a staple at the station for the past 30 years, announced his shock retirement last week after being diagnosed with Stage 3 bowel cancer two months prior.</p>
      <p>Shepherd says he is the “prime example” of why West Australians should stop putting off the “poo test”.</p>
      <p>“I’m an idiot, and didn’t do it multiple times thinking that I’m fine and healthy, and then found out that I had a stage 3 cancer that I had to have taken out and possibly spread into my blood I don’t know,” Shepherd said. “I’m having chemo as a result, so mine was a big slap in the face, and I skipped I would have to say three (tests), so I ... have been healthy all my life, never been to hospital before this, and then all of a sudden, BAM, there it is.”</p>

      <p>The test Shepherd skipped is a free at home kit that tests for blood in your stool and is sent to every Australian by the Federal Government once they turn 50, and every two years after that.</p>
      <p>“It sat on top of my cupboard in the kitchen, I would see it often when I got my keys and you know, the little niggly voice inside me saying, ‘You should do this, it’s easy, it takes no time,’ but I’m one of the 66 per cent of people that go, ‘I’m OK’,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Only 43 per cent of Western Australian’s return their free screening kits,” Melissa Ledger, cancer prevention and research director at Cancer Council WA said.</p>
      <p>“We would like to see participation up to about 60 per cent, and we know that if we can get participation at 60 per cent we could prevent almost 84,000 deaths by 2040 nationally.”</p>
      <p>The radio station announced live on air Friday that it would mark Shepherd’s farewell with a “bare your bum for bowel cancer” awareness event on December 6 at Swanbourne Beach.</p>
