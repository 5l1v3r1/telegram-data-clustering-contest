      <h1>James McAvoy Dishes On Producers Who Told Him He Was Too Short For Certain Roles</h1>

      <p>According to a report from JustJared.com, James McAvoy has been turned down for a number of roles in the past on account of his height. The 5’7″ 40-year-old actor claimed he once had a leading actress say their on-screen romance wasn’t believable due to the height difference between them.</p>
      <p>Speaking with reporters from The Telegraph, Mr. McAvoy said that “as a shorter man,” he has been turned down for characters repeatedly. The star says he is often made to feel as though “something can be done” about his height.</p>
      <p>According to James, a female co-star once asked if it was possible for him to even take on the role because he was just too short. The star added that it was like a “kick in the nuts.” James said it was challenging to pretend he really liked working with her afterward.</p>

      <p>Mr. McAvoy claimed there have been many situations in his career thus far where he has been made to feel as though he’s not good looking enough. Despite McAvoy’s struggles in the industry, there is no question he has managed to prevail.</p>
      <p>Fans of the actor know he has received critical acclaim in the past for his diverse roles, including, perhaps most recent, Split, from M. Night Shymalan.</p>
      <p>His work extends far beyond the dramatic as well, even appearing in the X-Men films including 2011’s X-Men: First Class, as well as Days Of Future Past and Apocalypse. According to James’ Wikipedia page, he earned a Golden Globe nomination for his work in the 2007 film, Atonement.</p>
      <p>This past year, McAvoy starred in M. Night Shyamalan’s newest film, Glass, the third film in Shymalan’s movie series featuring Unbreakable, Split, and Glass. Starring McAvoy, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bruce Willis, the film exceeded box office expectations and performed well against its $20 million budget.</p>
      <p>However, the movie wasn’t appreciated by critics, who often described it was “underwhelming” as well as “disappointing.” On the review aggregator website, Rotten Tomatoes, Glass has just a 37% rating, based on 355 reviews.</p>
