      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Heather Greenaway, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/heather-greenaway/</a></address>
      <p>He may have been dubbed the best celebrity interviewer in Britain but there is one VIP guest that still eludes award-winning podcaster Richard Herring <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/billy-connolly">Billy Connolly</a>.</p>
      <p>The star, who has hosted Richard Herring’s Leicester Square Theatre Podcast – RHLSTP – for seven years, has welcomed hundreds of guests from the worlds of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/comedy">comedy</a> and acting.</p>
      <p>Despite interviewing everyone from Steve Coogan and Bob Mortimer to Dawn French and Sarah Millican, the 52-year-old says the Big Yin will always remain at the top of his list.</p>
      <p>Richard said: “Sir Billy is a trailblazer – he was doing modern-day stand-up 40 years ago. You could say he invented the whole concept.</p>
      <p>“He was playing big arenas before anyone else, yet no matter the size of the venue, he still had an unbeatable command of the audience.</p>

      <p>“I’ve tried to get Billy on the podcast a few times but he’s had health issues and is busy but, from what I’ve seen, he looks in pretty good form so I will try again in 2020.”</p>
      <p>Richard, who is married to fellow comic Catie Wilkins, is coming to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a>'s Theatre Royal tonight with his podcast.</p>
      <p>He will be joined by comedians Limmy and Fern Brady.</p>
      <p>Richard said: “It’s going to be the biggest Glasgow gig I have done. I’m slightly trepidatious about it being me versus Limmy and me versus the audience but hopefully I will get out alive.</p>

      <p>“Getting him on was a no-brainer. He’s a genius.</p>
      <p>“He’s managed to stay very true to his roots and his autobiography is one of the greatest I have read.”</p>
      <p>He added: “Fern is also great. I’ve always liked her – she’s a really ballsy, fantastic performer. It’s going to be great to have her on.”</p>
