      <p>BENGALURU: Defending champions <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/bengaluru-fc">Bengaluru FC</a> continued their efforts to reclaim pole position as they scored their second straight win, overcoming a fighting <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kerala-Blasters">Kerala Blasters FC</a> 1-0, in the Indian <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Super-League">Super League</a> at a packed <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sree-Kanteerava-Stadium">Sree Kanteerava Stadium</a> here on Saturday.</p>
      <p>It was BFC skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sunil-chhetri">Sunil Chhetri</a> who silenced the manjapada, who turned out in thousands taking the total count at the stadium to 27, 083, scoring the all-important goal in the second half. The visitors, who were already without their key men in defence and midfield, ended with 10 men the on the field after substitute Mohammed Rafi limped out in the 86th minute. The win took BFC's tally to nine points - they are now second behind ATK - from five matches and helped them maintain their unbeaten run. This after a below par start which saw them draw their first three matches.</p>
      <p>Chhetri, back from international duty, put his team ahead in the 55th minute with a fine diving header from a corner kick. With the Blasters defence marking the usual suspects Aussie Eric Paartalu, Brazilian Rapahel Augusto and the tall Bengaluru FC defenders, Delgado sent the ball into the middle of the box and the unmarked skipper darted in and connected with precision.</p>
      <p>The goal came after some consistent pressure by the champions despite being pushed back by the Blasters who began strongly after changing ends. BFC looked to maintain their advantage after taking the lead and they almost doubled it through Delgado in another three minutes but defender Raju Gaikwad came up with a fine block.</p>
