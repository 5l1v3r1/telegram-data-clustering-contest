      <h3>WWE Rumors: Vince McMahon Is Reportedly Impressed By These Two ‘NXT’ Superstars</h3>
      <p>

      <p>A new report suggests that a pair of <i>NXT</i> standouts have caught the attention of <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/wwe/">WWE</a> owner and chairman <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/vince-mcmahon">Vince McMahon</a>, thus hinting at the possibility of a move to <i>Monday Night Raw</i> or <i>Friday Night SmackDown</i> in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>Citing a source within WWE, <a href="https://wrestlingnews.co/wwe-news/vince-mcmahon-has-his-eye-on-at-least-two-wwe-nxt-stars/"><i>WrestlingNews.co</i></a> wrote that Keith Lee is one of the <i>NXT</i> stars that have apparently impressed McMahon as of late. Per the outlet’s Paul Davis, the source claimed to have overheard the WWE boss “praising” Lee and projecting the 320-pounder as a “powerhouse heel” when he gets called up to <i>Raw</i> or <i>SmackDown</i>. Davis also reported that Lee has another thing working in his favor apart from his size and in-ring potential — his status as a well-liked individual in the locker room.</p>
      <p>In addition to Lee, Matt Riddle was mentioned as another <i>NXT</i> superstar who has received praise from McMahon. While the former UFC fighter had previously gotten some criticism for his <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5566484/wwe-news-nxt-star-fires-back-at-chris-jericho-after-he-offers-him-career-advice/">Twitter feuds</a> with legendary wrestlers such as Bill Goldberg and Chris Jericho, <i>WrestlingNews.co</i> reported that McMahon still sees a lot of potential in him, even going as far as to compare him to WWE Hall of Famer Shawn Michaels.</p>
      <p>“Vince like guys like Shawn who have that rebel mentality and he sees some of Shawn in Matt,” said a source who spoke to <i>WrestlingNews.co</i>‘s Davis.</p>
      <blockquote>“Matt can rub some people the wrong way but he’s a good guy and he will do great when Vince calls him up. I think he’s a future world champion. Vince will try to tweak him but his personality will get him far.”</blockquote>

      <p>As of this writing, it has yet to be determined whether Lee or Riddle will be included in <i>NXT</i>‘s team of five in the men’s elimination match at <i>Survivor Series</i> on Sunday. However, both men were spotlighted in the lead-up to the event, as they appeared on the November 1 episode of <i>Friday Night SmackDown</i> and took part in a series of segments that culminated with an attack on the villainous Sami Zayn, per <a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2019/11/1/20944620/matt-riddle-keith-lee-sami-zayn-wwe-smackdown-nxt"><i>Cageside Seats</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Despite how McMahon seemingly had great things to say about Lee and Riddle, it’s far from clear when they may be considered for a move to either one of WWE’s two main brands, as pointed out by Davis. He did, however, cite a source that believes the success of the <i>NXT</i> “invasion” storyline heading into <i>Survivor Series</i> could lead to “more crossover stuff” going forward, especially if All Elite Wrestling continues defeating the black-and-gold brand in terms of Wednesday night viewership figures.</p>
