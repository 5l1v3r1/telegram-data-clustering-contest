      <h1>Nicola Sturgeon flooded with letters and emails calling for end to 'shameful' sectarian marches</h1>
      <h2>A Freedom of Information request has revealed the First Minister was inundated with mail from shocked Scots following violent clashes in Glasgow this summer.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Ferguson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-ferguson/</a></address>
      <p>A dossier of letters and emails sent to Nicola ­Sturgeon in the wake of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-fork-out-175000-police-20535168">sectarian riots</a> and marches over the summer has lifted a lid on the extent of the public’s desire for change.</p>
      <p>The First Minister received much of the correspondence after violent clashes saw hundreds of police on the streets of Govan, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-fork-out-175000-police-20535168">Glasgow</a>.</p>
      <p>Roadblocks were set on fire and thugs hurled missiles after <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-fork-out-175000-police-20535168">Irish Republican</a> marchers were confronted by Loyalist protesters.</p>
      <p>The riot came months after a woman was spat on by a marcher at an <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-fork-out-175000-police-20535168">Orange walk</a> in the city centre, and was followed by further Republican and Loyalist ­demonstrations.</p>

      <p>One letter sent to Sturgeon, which has been released under Freedom of Information laws with the sender’s name covered, said: “For the first time in my 43 years of being born, ­educated and living in the west of Scotland I am embarrassed to be a Glaswegian.</p>
      <p>“I have been a victim of racially-­motivated hate crime a number of times ­living in ­<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-fork-out-175000-police-20535168">Glasgow</a>.</p>
      <p>“Most recently, I was pushed on to the road and called a “black b******” when I was walking with my wife on a ­Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“I have never felt I was not ­<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-fork-out-175000-police-20535168">Glaswegian</a> or ­Scottish but I was embarrassed to be both.</p>
      <p>“I work for a recruitment agency focused on ­attracting talent to Scotland based on the quality of life.</p>

      <p>“After ­witnessing these events, I do not see what the attraction would be for any new immigrant to Scotland.</p>
      <p>“I am asking you to question why the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-fork-out-175000-police-20535168">Scottish Government</a> has not done more to stop any of the hate-filled marches taking place in Scotland.”</p>
      <p>An email from another upset ­Glaswegian was sent following a march in the city centre in September.</p>
      <p>It said: “On Saturday, my wife and I decided to meet friends in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>“Little did we know our day would be ruined by bigots on both sides of the divide. Our friends were visiting from ­Canada and could not understand the scenes we witnessed.</p>
      <p>“My wife and I were embarrassed listening to the bile and insults hurled. These marches need to be banned to stop the shameful scenes we witnessed.”</p>
      <p>Fights broke out, missiles were thrown and roadblocks set on fire ­during the Govan clash on August 30.</p>
      <p>Riot police contained the mayhem after calling in extra resources.</p>
      <p>The scenes took place yards from Ibrox stadium, where <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-fork-out-175000-police-20535168">Rangers and Celtic</a> met the next day for the first Old Firm game of the season.</p>
      <p>The violence erupted during an event organised by the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-fork-out-175000-police-20535168">James Connolly ­Republic Flute Band</a>, which was trying to take part in an “Irish Unity March”. It prompted a counter-protest by ­Loyalists – many dressed all in black.</p>
      <p>There were a number of events in Glasgow that required a huge police presence in the weeks that followed.</p>
      <p>And a priest who was spat on outside <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-fork-out-175000-police-20535168">St Alphonsus Church</a> during an Orange march last year criticised the ­authorities for being “blind to anti-Catholic bigotry” after a woman was spat on at an event during the summer.</p>
      <p>Canon Tom White accused Glasgow City Council and Police Scotland of systematic failure in dealing with <br/>the issue.</p>

      <p>Marchers this summer were ­re-routed to avoid ­passing <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-fork-out-175000-police-20535168">St Alphonsus</a> but did pass another Catholic church.</p>
      <p>Many of the people who ­contacted ­Sturgeon demanded an end to Orange marches.</p>
      <p>A letter from a “very disappointed Scot” said: “What is happening when the powers that be continue to allow anti-­Catholic parades to parade by Catholic churches?</p>
      <p>“It seems ­anti-Catholic hatred is getting worse in ­<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-fork-out-175000-police-20535168">Scotland</a>.”</p>
      <p>Another email said: “These ­hateful, bigoted marches are ­disgusting, ­unnecessary and ­embarrassing.</p>
      <p>“For these ­simpletons to march and ­celebrate ­something that happened in 1690 is bizarre.”</p>

      <p>Another correspondent said: “It’s 2019 and yet again I’m unable to walk the streets of Glasgow without feeling threatened and bullied by the Orange Order marching in pure hatred of my Catholic religion. Why are you allowing this to happen?”</p>
      <p>Many of those who wrote to Sturgeon complained about <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-fork-out-175000-police-20535168">Irish Republican</a> walks in the city centre.</p>
      <p>One said: “I was horrified at the ­trouble that came about on Saturday regarding another ­Republican walk.”</p>
      <p>Another said: “I am angry and ­astonished at the decision to allow another Republican march in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>“The fact that they support the ­terrorist group the IRA is totally ­unacceptable and it should never have been allowed to take place.”</p>

      <p>A handwritten letter praised ­Sturgeon for speaking out about ­<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-fork-out-175000-police-20535168">sectarian marches</a>.</p>
      <p>But it added: ­“It is not enough to talk about it. These marches cause nothing but hatred and trouble so the time has come for government to step in.”</p>
      <p>The Scottish Government said: “It is clear from the correspondence we have received that the general public shares our desire for a Scotland free from ­sectarianism and violent disorder.”</p>
