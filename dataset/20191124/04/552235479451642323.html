      <p>A prison officer who hounded his girlfriend in an 18-month stalking campaign has left his job.</p>
      <p>Joe Pattie, 23, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/police-scotland-hunt-knife-thugs-20944374">refused </a>to leave former partner Blayre Howie alone after she broke off their relationship.</p>
      <p>Blayre, also 23, said her life became a “living hell”, with Pattie constantly turning up at her work and home.</p>
      <p>He called her up to 70 times a day using a work phone at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/police-scotland-hunt-knife-thugs-20944374">HMP Kilmarnock</a> and bombarded her with 50 texts daily, abusing her or begging her to take <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/police-scotland-hunt-knife-thugs-20944374">him back</a>.</p>
      <p>Blayre contacted Serco bosses three times about Pattie’s conduct and made an official complaint in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/police-scotland-hunt-knife-thugs-20944374">January</a>. An internal <br/>investigation was launched and we can reveal that Pattie is no longer employed as a prison officer.</p>
      <p>Hairdresser Blayre, from Kilmarnock, said: “It took over my life. I was afraid to go outside. He really thought he was above the law.</p>
      <p>“Once I had 70 missed calls from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/police-scotland-hunt-knife-thugs-20944374">HMP Kilmarnock</a> – I had to block the number.</p>
      <p>“In the end, I contacted the police because he wouldn’t leave me alone and his work didn’t seem to be able to do anything about it.”</p>
      <p>In one voicemail message, Pattie told Blayre: “F****** phone me. I’ve not f****** messaged her. You’re f****** leaving me here, it’s absolutely ridiculous. F****** phone me.”</p>
      <p>A text message he sent said: “Swear to God you better have phoned in by half three or your mum will see me tonight, I promise you. And if you say your mum won’t be in, trust me, I’ll wait.”</p>
      <p>Blayre, who met Pattie in April 2015, said he quickly became “obsessive, manipulative, controlling and a pathological liar”.</p>
      <p>In September, Pattie appeared at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/police-scotland-hunt-knife-thugs-20944374">Kilmarnock Sheriff Court</a> and admitted engaging in conduct that placed Blayre in a state of fear or alarm between July 2017 and January this year.</p>
      <p>Last month, he was handed a community payback order and a non-harassment order lasting two years.</p>
      <p>He was also told to compete 160 hours of unpaid work in six months.</p>
      <p>Serco said: “This individual no longer works at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/police-scotland-hunt-knife-thugs-20944374">HMP Kilmarnock</a>.”</p>
      <p>Pattie did not comment when contacted by the Sunday Mail.</p>
