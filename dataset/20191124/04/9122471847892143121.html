      <h1>Upset Alert: No. 9 Oklahoma Is Now In Danger Of Losing To TCU</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:00:14+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>No. 9 Oklahoma only has one loss, but the Sooners have been treading water for a few weeks now. That continues today against TCU.</p>
      <p>Midway through the fourth quarter, the Sooners lead <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=401112120">is just 28-24</a>. Lincoln Riley’s team appeared to be keeping the Horned Frogs at a distance, but a pick six has made things extremely interesting.</p>
      <p>The play wound up being a 14 point swing. Jalen Hurts threw a pass from the two-yard line, which got picked off and returned 98 yards for a score by Vernon Scott.</p>

      <p>Hurts had been magnificent through the first few months of the season, and has always been safe with the football, but he’s gotten more turnover prone as the year has worn on.</p>
      <p>TCU has the ball back deep in their own territory, after Nook Bradford forced a Hurts fumble on a 32-yard run by the Heisman candidate quarterback.</p>
      <p>Even if Oklahoma holds on to win this one, it probably won’t help the Sooners reach the ultimate goal too much. Despite being the clear Big 12 favorite, the Sooners are just <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-12">No. 9 in the country</a>, and have a number of teams to jump. Oregon’s potential loss to Arizona State in Tempe helps, but the Sooners need to impress the selection committee enough to jump a number of teams, including a one-loss potential Pac-12 champion Utah, and of course, Alabama.</p>
      <p>After a loss at Kansas State, Oklahoma beat Iowa State by one, and Baylor by three last week. Wins are certainly wins, but to make the four-team Playoff field, style points do matter.</p>
