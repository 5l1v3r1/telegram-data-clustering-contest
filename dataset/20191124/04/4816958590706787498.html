      <h1>Edwards-Helaire, No. 1 LSU pull away from Arkansas</h1>

      <p>Clyde Edwards-Helaire rushed for 188 yards and three touchdowns as No. 1 LSU overcame a slow start to rout visiting Arkansas 56-20 and clinch the SEC West Division title Saturday night in Baton Rouge, La.</p>
      <p>Edwards-Helaire had just six carries and scored on runs of 27, 26 and 89 yards. He also caught seven passes for 65 yards.</p>
      <p>The back stole a bit of the spotlight from presumed Heisman Trophy front-runner Joe Burrow, who played just 2 1/2 quarters as the Tigers (11-0, 7-0) scored touchdowns in their last three possessions of the second quarter and on four straight in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Burrow had what has become a routine performance for him, completing 23 of 28 attempts for 327 yards and three touchdowns.</p>
      <p>The Tigers will face East division champion Georgia in the SEC Championship Game on Dec. 7. LSU won its first division title since 2011, and a home victory against Texas A&amp;M next Saturday would match that team as the only ones in school history to have a 12-0 regular season.</p>
      <p>The Razorbacks (2-9, 0-7) were playing their first game under interim head coach Barry Lunney Jr., who was promoted from tight ends coach/special teams coordinator after Chad Morris was fired nearly two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Tyrion Davis-Price ran 2 yards for a touchdown, Edwards-Helaire ran 27 for his first touchdown and Burrow and Justin Jefferson teamed for a 10-yard score on three straight possessions in the final eight minutes of the first half. LSU increased a 7-6 lead to 28-6 at the break.</p>
      <p>On the Tigers’ second possession of the second half, Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase connected on a 50-yard touchdown pass. Edwards-Helaire ran for two more touchdowns before John Emery ran 39 yards for a touchdown 33 seconds into the fourth quarter to cap LSU’s scoring.</p>
      <p>The Tigers, who allowed more than 600 yards in a 58-37 victory at Ole Miss a week earlier, kept the Razorbacks out of the end zone until the fourth quarter and allowed just 304 yards.</p>
      <p>LSU received the opening kickoff and drove 75 yards, finishing the drive with Burrow’s 37-yard touchdown pass to Chase.</p>
      <p>Arkansas answered with field goals of 24 and 47 yards by Connor Limpert.</p>
