      <h1>Predicting The Top 10 For This Week’s College Football Playoff Rankings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:09:25+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>The College Football Playoff rankings are in for a major shakeup this week. Oregon, previously the No. 6 team in the country, lost to Arizona State in a stunner on the road. As a result, the Ducks have likely been eliminated from consideration.</p>
      <p>Ohio State, meanwhile, took care of business against Penn State, ending the Nittany Lions’ national title hopes. The Buckeyes got out to an early 21-0 lead and hung on for a 28-17 victory.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, LSU crushed Arkansas, Georgia held off Texas A&amp;M, Alabama blasted Western Carolina, Oklahoma outlasted TCU and Minnesota handled Northwestern.</p>
      <p>Alabama and Oklahoma are the two biggest beneficiaries from Oregon’s loss. Utah could still finish the season as a one-loss Pac-12 champion, however.</p>
      <p>Here’s what we think the top 10 of this week’s College Football Playoff rankings will look like:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>LSU</li>
        <li>Ohio State</li>
        <li>Clemson</li>
        <li>Georgia</li>
        <li>Alabama</li>
        <li>Utah</li>
        <li>Oklahoma</li>
        <li>Minnesota</li>
        <li>Florida</li>
        <li>Wisconsin</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The rankings officially come out on Tuesday night. College football fans – do we have it right?</p>
