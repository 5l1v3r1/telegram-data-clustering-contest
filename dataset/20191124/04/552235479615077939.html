      <h1>Prince Andrew's favourite golf club could ditch Duke as new claims about paedo pal's parties emerge</h1>
      <h2>Officials at Royal Perth Golfing Society have expressed "concerns" while new story about “big-breasted women” at Epstein party has emerged.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sophie Adams</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew faces losing his role as patron of one of his favourite golf courses.</p>
      <p>Officials at Royal Perth Golfing Society have said they are “concerned” about the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/prince-andrew">Duke of York</a>’s ­involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.</p>
      <p>Golf-mad Andrew is the patron of Royal Perth, which is almost 200 years old.</p>
      <p>The club was the first to be allowed to use “royal” in its title, having been given patronage by William IV.</p>
      <p>It’s thought it could ask for another <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/royal-family">royal patron</a> if it decides to cut its ties with the controversial prince after his car-crash ­interview on the BBC.</p>
      <p>Club secretary Paul Lewis said yesterday: “Royal Perth Golfing S­ociety is concerned by recent events and is monitoring the situation. That is all we can say at this time.”</p>

      <p>Andrew is also a member of the Royal Burgess Golfing ­Society of Edinburgh, honorary president of Inverness Golf Club and patron at Royal Montrose.</p>
      <p>All three clubs declined to comment yesterday.</p>
      <p>Andrew’s woes deepened yesterday after a former lapdancer claimed he blew a raspberry on her breasts at one of paedophile Epstein’s infamous parties.</p>
      <p>She said the prince buried his face in her chest, then said she should be in a magazine for “big-breasted women”.</p>
      <p>The woman told our sister paper the Sunday Mirror she was paid by Epstein to hire girls to attend, adding: “The girls had been specially selected to try to please Andrew. I believed the Duke liked curvy girls like his ex-wife, Fergie.”</p>

      <p>The woman said there were rooms for sex and girls who looked too young stayed in the upstairs rooms at Epstein’s £77million New York mansion.</p>
      <p>There is no suggestion Andrew was aware of any underage girls being at the parties in the late 90s.</p>
      <p>The woman, now 47, also claimed cameras recorded guests so Epstein had leverage over them, if needed.</p>
      <p>Epstein was found dead in a New York jail cell in August.</p>
      <p>Andrew, 59, has vehemently denied any wrongdoing while associating with him – or witnessing his criminal activities.</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the latest claims.</p>
