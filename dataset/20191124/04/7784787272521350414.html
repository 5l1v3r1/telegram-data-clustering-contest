      <h3>Jamie Whincup has taken one step towards Newcastle redemption as he claimed pole position for the final race of the 2019 season.</h3>
      <p>The seven-time champion was at his imperious best in the Top 10 Shootout to put over two tenths over next-best Cameron Waters, who qualified fastest earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>Whincup was the ninth man out in the dash for pole, and dropped in a stunning 1:10.5551s flyer to put distance between himself and his challengers.</p>
      <p>It was the third pole of the season for Whincup, and the 83rd of his decorated career.</p>

      <p>Launching from P1 will give Whincup confidence of sorts following his late-race meltdown on Saturday, which cost the Red Bull Holden Racing Team crucial points in the battle for the teams’ championship.</p>
      <p>Whincup ran second behind teammate and eventual winner Shane van Gisbergen before his critical error with 20 laps remaining, with the 36-year-old plummeting to eighth by race’s end.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, it was van Gisbergen’s time to strike drama as he missed the Shootout, before copping a grid penalty for impeding Will Davison. The 2016 champion will start 21st for the season finale, a stark contrast to his brilliant pole a day earlier.</p>
      <p>Shell V-Power Racing holds the cards in the teams’ title fight, enjoying a 143-point lead over the factory Holden squad heading into Sunday’s action. Fabian Coulthard – <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/supercars/coulthard-happier-after-ending-fourmonth-wait-with-newcastle-race-31-podium/news-story/f47c22edf72cb8c269037bca40fbd52a">who reached the Saturday podium and broke a four-month drought</a> – managed to defeat champion-elect Scott McLaughlin in the Shootout to third, albeit by a scant margin.</p>
      <p>Scott Pye (#2 Walkinshaw Andretti United ZB Commodore) continued his resurgence to drop his car into fifth – a sterling effort as he continues to battle a bout of gastro.</p>
      <p>Penrite Racing teammates Anton De Pasquale and David Reynolds ended up sixth and seventh, ahead of Tim Slade (#14 Freightliner Racing), Lee Holdsworth (#5 The Bottle-O Racing Mustang) and James Courtney (#22 Walkinshaw Andretti United ZB Commodore).</p>

      <p>After having Saturday night to reflect on his Race 31 error, Whincup was elated to claim another pole.</p>
      <p>“That one meant a lot,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Went all out, track was obviously a bit slower than yesterday or even qualifying, but got the most out of the car.</p>
      <p>“It’s a bloody good feeling to get pole around here.</p>
      <p>“We just gave it all we had, obviously the time we're very, very happy with, but you've got to keep a wrap on it because 95 laps is a long way this afternoon.</p>
      <p>“We'll have a little celebration of this right now and then focus on the race.”</p>
