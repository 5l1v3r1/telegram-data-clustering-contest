        <b>Salman Khan was livid with the housemates during Bigg Boss 13 Weekend Ka Vaar and wishes to detach himself from the show. Ranging from Sidharth Shukla - Asim Riaz to Shehnaz Gill - Himanshi Khurana, he spared no one and called it the worst week in the history of Bigg Boss</b>

      <p>Bigg Boss 13 seems to be getting uglier by the day as the contestants go the distance when it comes to fights, and this week, Asim Riaz and Sidharth Shukla crossed the limit when their fight turned physical. Even Salman Khan was livid and wishes to detach himself from the show. He called it the ‘worst week in the history of Bigg Boss’.In the Weekend Ka Vaar episode, Salman let his disappointment known to the contestants over all the physical fights in the house. Looking at all their behaviour, he says he is no more interested in the show. Ranging from Sidharth Shukla- Asim Riaz to Shehnaaz Gill-Himanshi Khurana, he spared no one.<br/><br/>Salman Khan reminds the contestants that his reputation is also at stake as his fans watch the weekend episodes for him and also insisted the contestants not ‘sc**w his image’. Calling this the worst week in the history of Bigg Boss, he tells the contestants ‘bhaad me jao’. He was shocked that people can fight over fruits in the house and asked Asim and Sidharth to explain themselves as to why they ended up fighting over apples and oranges. The other contestants tell Salman that it was just an ego tussle between the two. <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-shehnaaz-gill-s-father-santokh-singh-sukh-salman-khan-supports-my-daughter-because-she-s-an-entertainer-exclusive/5dd9543e0cada251e9c311cb">ALSO READ: Bigg Boss 13: Shehnaaz Gill's Father Santokh Singh Sukh, ‘Salman Khan Supports My Daughter Because She’s An Entertainer’- EXCLUSIVE</a></p>

      <p>Salman Khan also addresses the never-ending fight between Himanshi Khurana and Shehnaaz Gill and slams Himanshi by saying that if she shouldn’t have come on the show if she had so many problems with Shehnaaz. Not just that, he also lashes out at Shefali and calls her out for being an unfair sanchaalak, having declared Himanshi the winner, when Sidharth Shukla clearly won the task.<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source: Twitter/ColorsTV</i></p>
