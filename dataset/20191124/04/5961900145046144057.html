      <p>Unless you’ve experienced a complete social media blackout this weekend, you’ll be well aware that <b>Steph Claire Smith</b> just tied the knot with longtime boyfriend <b>Josh Miller</b> in country Victoria. They got hitched exactly a year after they got engaged and, goddamn, the wedding looks like it was absolute Instaporn. We stan. (Check out our lil’ <a href="https://www.pedestrian.tv/entertainment/steph-claire-smith-josh-miller-wedding/">wedding recap here</a> for further info on all the festivities.)</p>
      <p>Now, as expected, Steph’s started spamming her IG followers with wedding flicks, giving us some first glimpses at her wedding and reception dresses.</p>
      <p>“Oh guys… get ready for the wedding spam…,” she captioned the below ‘gram. “I’ve only received a handful of pics from @lostinlove_photography and I am already LOVING THEM ???? Yesterday was hands down the best night of our lives and we’re so so so incredibly happy.”</p>
      <p>Her One Day Bridal wedding getup features a cute two-piece moment. It’s abs-olutely something to be marvelled at.</p>

      <p>Although she’s yet to post any photos of her reception outfit to the grid, these IG story screenshots hint at another two-piece, silk getup. Huge vibe.</p>
