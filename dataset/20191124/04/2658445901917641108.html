      <p>THE governor of the state of Osun, Gboyega Oyetola, on Saturday declared that the investment of his administration in the health sector of the state remains unprecedented, reiterating his commitment to making healthcare accessible and affordable for all and sundry throughout the state.</p>
      <p>Oyetola who was represented by the Commissioner for Works and Transport, Remi Omowaiye, made this known during a working tour of some re-modelled primary healthcare centres in the state.</p>
      <p>According to him, barely a year that the present administration came into office in the state, it had gone a long way in fulfilling the promise it made to the people in the area of health, adding that the government will not relent until healthcare becomes available to every individual in the state.</p>
      <p>“When this administration came on board, we promised to remodel and revitalise 332 primary healthcare centres across the state, with one in each ward. At present, we have awarded 275 out of which over 150 has been completed and the remaining 125 in the various stages of completion.</p>

      <p>“We have only commissioned 25 because it will take too long to commission the remaining 100 that is already completed. I must add that the effort is not restricted to primary healthcare system alone as we have also moved to secondary healthcare services and General Hospitals.</p>
      <p>General Hospital Ejigbo is ready for commissioning, we are upgrading fully State Hospital Osogbo. Also, to ensure a seamless and effective healthcare delivery system, we have ensured that personnel are made available because a beautiful edifice without adequate staff is a waste.</p>
      <p>“The governor is committed and we will ensure that we fulfill every promise this administration made to the people of the state especially in terms of healthcare delivery and all other sectors that will impact life positively for the people,” Omowaiye stated. He further stated that the state within the last one year has also witnessed significant development of road infrastructure.</p>
