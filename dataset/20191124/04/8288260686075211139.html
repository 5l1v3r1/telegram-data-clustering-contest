      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers latest | All the reaction to Wolves' impressive win at Bournemouth</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <h3>Mini match report</h3>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers made it back-to-back Premier League victories with a narrow 2-1 win over Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>Wolves, who kept their 3-4-3 formation from the win over Aston Villa, were on the front foot from the opening minute and richly deserved their lead when it came.</p>
      <p>The opener was a stunning free-kick from the superb <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/joao-moutinho">Joao Moutinho</a> inside 21 minutes and one became two when <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/raul-jimenez">Raul Jimenez</a> scored his 14th of the season.</p>
      <p>Only minutes later, Wolves’ dominance grew further when the Cherries' captain, Simon Francis, was dismissed for a second yellow before half time.</p>

      <p>In the second half, Wolves had the ball in the net for the third time when Diogo Jota fired home, but it was disallowed after the referee’s assistant had already put his flag up. But replays showed Jota and Jimenez were both clearly onside.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> seemingly cruising to three points, Steve Cook flicked a header into Rui Patricio’s net setting up a nervy last half hour.</p>
      <p>Chances for Jimenez and Jota came and went before Patricio made a point blank save to deny Nathan Ake an equaliser.</p>
      <p>In injury time, Arnaut Danjuma should have broke Wolves hearts but conspired to fire over from 10 yards and Nuno’s men held on to move fifth in the Premier League.</p>
      <h3>Nuno's verdict</h3>
      <p>“I think it was a good game, honestly. I think first half we played very good, we played really, really well.</p>
      <p>“Balanced, creating chances, always with good possession, organised. I think we achieved the advantage.</p>
      <p>“Then with one man less, until the end of the first half we managed well. In the second half, we knew that Bournemouth are a very good team. Very good players, Eddie [Howe] reacted and created problems. We know that the game was dangerous it was about getting the third goal, but at the same time keeping the balance.</p>
      <p>“I think we performed well and I’m happy with the boys, because the first half should be our reference for how we want to proceed and to keep on growing and improving.”</p>

      <h3>Howe's verdict</h3>
      <p>“It’s so difficult to change as you’re playing at that moment, you hope the players can get it right. But we didn’t deliver it.</p>
      <p>“We were a yard off our press, we allowed them to play round us, they have very good technical players and we allowed them to come into the game, which wasn’t what we intended.</p>
      <p>“I have to take responsibility for that, every time you send a team onto the pitch you want to cover all bases for them and make sure you get it right, but I felt we didn’t and ultimately that’s my call.”</p>

      <h3>Fans hail 'the best'</h3>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers favourite Joao Moutinho has signed a new contract with the club.</p>
      <p>The majestic midfielder put in his latest star showing in Wolves’ 2-1 victory over Bournemouth today. He started the scoring with a stunning free-kick to notch up his second goal in Wolves colours.</p>
      <p>And Wolves have now announced that Moutinho has signed a new deal which will keep him at Molineux until at least 2022.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, supporters are delighted with the news that last season’s player of the year has committed his future to the club.</p>

      <p>Richard Ralph: Best midfielder I've seen at Molineux and I'm nearly 50. Thank you.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Pilbeam: Fully deserved. What a footballer. Still can’t believe he plays for us.</p>
      <p>Paul Stringer: Technically he’s the best player I have seen play at Wolves... he is a class act.</p>
      <p>Lee Bourne: He’s the best I've ever seen at the Mol - I was born in 75.</p>
      <p>Malcolm Mason: I thought I heard all today’s good news with our win, but now we hear this. It’s like I’ve got a win on the lottery. They say things come in threes, hmmmmm????</p>
