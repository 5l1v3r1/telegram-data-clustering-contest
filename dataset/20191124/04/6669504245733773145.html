      <p>DENVER - A quick goal by Colorado got Tyson Barrie's homecoming off to a rough start, but Toronto's dominating stretch helped him celebrate in his return to Denver.</p>
      <p>Barrie had a goal and an assist during a four-goal burst in the first period, leading the Maple Leafs to a 5-3 victory over the Avalanche on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Auston Matthews also had a goal and an assist as Toronto earned its second straight win since Sheldon Keefe took over after Mike Babcock was fired Wednesday. Keefe coached the Maple Leafs to a 3-1 win at Arizona on Thursday night and had to survive a frenetic ending to earn another victory.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes they're not too pretty," goaltender Frederik Andersen said of the win.</p>
      <p>Nicholas Shore, Zach Hyman and Kasperi Kapanen also scored for Toronto, and Andersen had 34 saves.</p>
      <p>Barrie, who was traded to the Maple Leafs in July, got a warm reception from fans during a timeout in the first period. The defenceman spent seven-plus seasons with the Avalanche and left as the franchise leader in goals (75), assists (232) and points (307) at his position.</p>
      <p>During a timeout in the first period the team played a highlight video of his career with the franchise and the fans gave him a standing ovation.</p>
      <p>"I wasn't sure how it was going to feel coming back here," Barrie said. "It's been an amazing place to call home the last few years and that really topped it off."</p>
      <p>Nazem Kadri, who was sent to Colorado in the deal, had two assists against his former team.</p>
      <p>The Maple Leafs recovered after Colorado's Nathan MacKinnon scored 31 seconds into the game.</p>
      <p>Shore tied it midway through the first period. Matthews put Toronto in front 67 seconds later, and Barrie gave the Maple Leafs a two-goal lead with his second goal in two games with 6:38 left.</p>
      <p>"It was good for Barrie to get a big goal coming back here, in a place he spent a lot of time and that gave us some jump as well," Matthews said.</p>
      <p>Kapanen capped the eight-minute surge with his seventh of the season with 2 1/2 minutes to go.</p>
      <p>That chased Philipp Grubauer, who allowed four goals on 15 shots. Pavel Francouz had 12 saves in relief.</p>
      <p>"I think the first period was a bit of a write off, we didn’t show up, so (we) just dug ourselves in a hole and it was too much to climb out of," Kadri said. "Second and third periods, we were definitely the better team but the first period hurt us.”</p>
      <p>The Avalanche crept back into the game with goals from Andre Burakovsky in the second period and Valeri Nichushkin in the third to make it 4-3. Nichushkin's goal was his first since March 4, 2016, when he was with Dallas, a span on 92 games.</p>
      <p>"He's been having a lot of chances, just having some bad luck," Burakovsky said of Nichushkin. "I'm real happy for him. He's been creating, been having a lot of opportunities. Hopefully he keeps that up."</p>
      <p>Andersen's mask was dented by a shot before Nichushkin's goal and he was trying to alert the official to stop play so he could get a new one.</p>
      <p>"The cage had a huge dent in it. I tried to get it blown down so I could get a new one but the ref didn't see it," Andersen said. Luckily nothing happened but obviously when it's dented, the middle eyelid there, the space there is pretty big. I don't know if a puck could've gone in but a stick definitely could have."</p>
      <p>Andersen came up big in the final 2:47 when Colorado had an extra skater on the ice. The Avalanche had the puck in the Toronto end for most of that time but couldn't score.</p>
      <p>NOTES: Avalanche LW Tyson Jost returned to the lineup after missing three games with an upper-body injury. Colorado assigned F Jayson Megna to the minors. ... Toronto C Alexander Kerfoot played his first game against Colorado since the Avalanche traded him to the Maple Leafs in the Barrie deal.</p>
