      <p>The teaser above leaves us wondering which handset we will be seeing in just over a week since no rumors or leaks have surfaced recently. That said, just a couple days back<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/17/there-nokia-phones-gets-eec-certification/"> three devices</a> appeared on Russian certification site EEC. The three devices were the Nokia 9.1, Nokia 8.2, Nokia 5.2 and Nokia 2.3.</p>
      <p>According to the certification data, the Nokia 5.2 will feature a 5.7-inch or smaller display. Meanwhile the Nokia 8.2 appears to feature 4G and 5G variants. This suggest the smartphone might be packed with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 735. A CPU that brings mid-range performance yet features a 5G cellular network support along with compatibility with Dual Mode SA / NSA (Stand-Alone / Non-Standalone); a faster and more reliable 5G standard.</p>

      <p>This latter device is most likely the one we will see unveiled on December 5th as its predecessor, the Nokia 8.1, launched exactly a year before, on December 5th 2018.</p>
      <p>That said, Nokia could bring two or more devices at the same launch event. Announcing both the Nokia 8.2, Nokia 5.2 or Nokia 2.3 at the same time. Which one are you guys looking forward to the most?</p>
