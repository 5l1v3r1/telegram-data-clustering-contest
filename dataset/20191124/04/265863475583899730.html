      <h1>Miley Cyrus – Here’s How She Reportedly Reacted To Liam Hemsworth’s Sister-In-Law Throwing Shade At Her!</h1>

      <p>Liam Hemsworth’s sister in law, Elsa Pataky, did not hesitate to throw some shade at his former wife, Miley Cyrus by suggesting that he ‘deserves much better’ than her! That being said, one insider report claims to know how she reacted to the diss.</p>
      <p>Ever since their separation earlier this year, Miley and Liam have both remained pretty quiet about their failed relationship but the same cannot be said about the wife of Liam’s brother, Chris Evans.</p>
      <p>Elsa was asked to update fans of how Liam has been doing in the aftermath of the shocking split and she definitely delivered!</p>
      <p>However, one insider tells HollywoodLife that Miley is not letting the mean comment affect her too much.</p>
      <p>‘Miley really isn’t concerned one way or another with what Elsa says or thinks about her. Miley knows the truth about her relationship and what went down between them. Miley wishes everyone would respect their privacy and not talk about their past in public because Liam and she are the only ones who actually know the full truth.’</p>
      <p>They went on to dish that ‘Miley understands they both have family and loved ones who’ve shown them support during this split, but does not think anyone should be speaking negatively about their current situation. Miley’s family has never mentioned one word about Liam, and she’d like his family to respect the same boundaries.’</p>
      <p>That’s not to say that Elsa’s words didn’t still come as a shock to Miley as well as her close friends and family members who heard about it.</p>
      <p>After all, the former sisters in law were once super close to the point that they even got matching tattoos!</p>
