      <p>After tonight's <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE </a>NXT TakeOver: War Games 2019 came to an end, WWE EVP <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/triple-h">Triple H</a> took a media call and discussed a long string of topics. The Game opened up on CM Punk and revealed that he hasn't talked with the WWE Backstage analyst.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/cm-punk">CM Punk</a> made his shocking return last week at the end of WWE Backstage, and took the Pro Wrestling world by storm. This past week, Punk made his official debut on WWE Backstage as a special contributor and analyst. The former WWE Champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/11-bold-comments-cm-punk-made-on-his-1st-wwe-backstage-appearance">discussed </a>a number of topics, most notably Seth Rollins' challenge, the new WWE Universal Title belt, and King Corbin's "The Big Dog" segment on SmackDown that was Corbin's attempt at mocking <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/roman-reigns">Roman Reigns</a>.</p>

      <p>Punk made it clear during the appearance that he hasn't talked with anyone in WWE, and it would take some work to mend those bridges. Tonight, Triple H shared his thoughts on Punk during the post-War Games media call, and stated that he hasn't talked with Punk.</p>
      <p>Triple H also made sure Sam Roberts didn't utter the words "the person" and 'Chicago' in the same sentence while teasing the fourth member of Tommaso Ciampa's team, to ensure that fans wouldn't get their hopes up.</p>
