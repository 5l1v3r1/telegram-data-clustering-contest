      <p>Tonight on <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE </a>NXT TakeOver: War Games, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/kevin-owens">Kevin Owens</a> came out as the fourth member of Tommaso Ciampa's team in the War Games match against The Undisputed Era. Ciampa, Owens, Keith Lee, and Dominik Dijakovic stood tall when all was said and done. WWE has now released exclusive backstage footage of Kevin Owens on its official Instagram page, which shows Owens getting fired up moments before he makes his entrance.</p>
      <p>On the latest edition of Monday Night RAW, WWE EVP Triple H attempted to convince Kevin Owens to join NXT, and the segment ended with a huge brawl that saw The Undisputed Era ganging up on Owens. The brawl came to an end when The O.C. came out and fended off the attackers. Ever since then, speculation was running rampant among fans in regards to Owens possibly coming back to NXT.</p>
