      <p>To a generation of Scottish shoppers, it was up there as one of the most famous logos on the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/glasgow-high-street-icon-torn-20895201">High Street</a>.</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/glasgow-high-street-icon-torn-20895201">What Every Woman Wants</a> founder Vera Weisfeld has been presented with what remains of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/glasgow-high-street-icon-torn-20895201">signage</a> from her chain’s former flagship store.</p>
      <p>The 81-year-old was given two signs which hung inside her HQ in Argyle Street, Glasgow.</p>
      <p>After reading of Vera’s sadness at the building being removed, construction firm <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/glasgow-high-street-icon-torn-20895201">Dem-Master</a> Demolition Ltd contacted the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/glasgow-high-street-icon-torn-20895201">Sunday Mail</a> and offered to give her part of its history.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’m delighted to have this sign. It’s amazing as it brings back so many happy memories.”</p>
      <p>Retail entrepreneur Vera and her husband Gerald founded cut-price clothing chain <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/glasgow-high-street-icon-torn-20895201">What Every Woman Wants</a> in 1971.</p>
      <p>At its peak in 1989, the chain had a turnover of £100million, before the business was sold in 1990 for £50million.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/glasgow-high-street-icon-torn-20895201">Dem-Master Demolition</a> said: “We’re fortunate to be in the position to give a small piece of the history back to Mrs Weisfeld.”</p>
