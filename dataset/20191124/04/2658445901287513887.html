      <p>Surulere Local government chairman, Hon. Tajudeen Ajide, has added another feather in his cap, as he was named among 2019 recipients of the 18th Nigerian Local Government Chairmen Merit Award (LOGMA) for excellent service delivery and performance.</p>
      <p>Ajide was physically on ground to receive the award at the National Merit House Abuja among 23 other local government chairmen in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>According to Chief Executive Officer of Mentors Communication, the organisers of the yearly award, Prince Bayo Ojo, Ajide was among the best performing chairmen in the year under review. He said: “the award was instituted in 2000 to stimulate fair competition for service delivery among local government chairmen and to also celebrate their exemplary qualities.”</p>
      <p>Ajide was lauded in the area of quality road construction and rehabilitation, landmark buildings, welfare of the aged and women, health services and education. It noted that the grassroots politician has completed 38 roads in Surulere within two years of his administration.</p>
      <p>Special guest of honour, Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Sen. George Akume, believed that this will encourage the chairman to do more.</p>
      <p>In his reaction, Ajide appreciated God for giving him the opportunity to serve humanity, while appreciating his family, the entire Surulere LG staff, management team, executives and the legislative arm for their unrelenting support for a better and greater Surulere.</p>
