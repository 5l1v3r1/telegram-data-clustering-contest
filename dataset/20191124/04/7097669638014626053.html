      <h1>Iran Would Be Wasting Its Time Building an 'F-35'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Sebastien Roblin</a></address>
      <p><b>Key Point:</b> Iran has reasons to want a stealth fighter, but it is a very expensive undertaking.</p>
      <p>There can be such a thing as posturing too hard.</p>
      <p>Iran’s aviation industry has accomplishments to boast about despite operating under heavy sanctions for nearly forty years. It has managed to keep once state-of-the-art U.S.-built<a href="https://warisboring.com/the-f-4-is-a-great-fighter-with-a-bad-reputation/"> F-4 Phantom</a> and<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-legendary-f-14-tomcat-the-plane-america-iran-both-love-18052"> F-14 Tomcat fighters</a> in operational condition for decades, including nine years of high-intensity aerial warfare with Iraq, despite being cut off from spare parts from the United States. It has refurbished the rusting hulks of old F-5 Freedom Fighters into<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-irans-fighter-jet-ripoff-just-fake-news-19487"> twin-vertical stabilizer Saeqeh fighters</a>, reverse-engineered their J85 turbojet engines, and created a variety of viable capable drones.</p>
      <p>All of these scrappy-underdog accomplishments fall far short of developing a working stealth fighter. Russia, which possesses a mature military aviation industry, has basically thrown the towel on its Su-57 stealth fighter program (at least<a href="http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/22234/no-russias-su-57-stealth-fighter-program-isnt-dead-at-least-not-yet"> on the short term</a>) because the expenses and technical challenges have proven so prohibitive. Much wealthier countries ranging from<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/will-germany-france-develop-europes-first-stealth-fighter-25695"> France</a>,<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/will-germany-france-develop-europes-first-stealth-fighter-25695"> Germany</a>,<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/india-getting-ready-build-its-own-stealth-fighter-21799"> India</a>,<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/revealed-japan-already-has-its-own-stealth-fighter-25591"> Japan</a> and the<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/forget-f-35-tempest-could-be-future-armed-lasers-hypersonic-missiles-and-swarms-26441"> UK</a> are only in the early stages of developing their own.</p>
