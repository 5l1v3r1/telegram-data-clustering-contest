      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:13:53+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:13</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>There are more WAGs at war after Leroy Sane’s girlfriend Candice Brook and Riyad Mahrez’s wife Rita supposedly had a very heated exchange.</p>
      <p>The partners of the Manchester City stars reportedly traded insults over text message.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10267891/riyad-mahrez-deontay-wilder-flirt-wife-rita/">The Sun on Sunday</a> claim Candice called Rita a “real groupie bitch”.</p>
      <p>In messages seen by the paper, she went on to say: “You eating with your fat ass stomach, lol.”</p>
      <p>Rita allegedly responded that her rival "looks like a boy".</p>
      <p>It comes in the wake of Wayne Rooney’s wife Coleen accusing Rebekah Vardy of selling stories on her.</p>

      <p>Convinced Coleen claimed there is no doubt it was the wife of Leicester star Jamie after setting a trap for the mum of four on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>
      <p>Now the heat is off them as two more WAGs begin a feud.</p>
      <p>A source says there is ill feeling after the paper reported boxing star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> flirted with Rita.</p>
      <p>They said: “Rita was left in floods of tears. She did nothing wrong when she met Deontay.</p>
      <p>"Some of the comments were deeply hurtful and highly personal.</p>

      <p>“She is now really concerned that things could get out of hand at the club Christmas party. Rita is even thinking about taking her own security to the event.</p>
      <p>“A lot of the wags have been told about the content of the messages and believe Candice acted like a bully towards Rita.”</p>

      <p>Footballers Rooney and Vardy reportedly unfollowed each other on social media after the high-profile spat.</p>

      <p>But Sane and Mahrez 'have come to an agreement'.</p>
      <p>The source added: “The last thing Man City fans want is for this feud to spill out on to the pitch as they try to catch Liverpool at the top of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>“Riyad is very protective of his wife. He spoke calmly to Leroy.</p>
      <p>"They shook hands, and agreed their partners’ row wouldn’t affect their performances.”</p>
