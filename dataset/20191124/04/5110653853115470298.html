      <h1>Oklahoma outlasts TCU with controversial first-down call from refs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:50:37+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:50</time> by <a rel="author">Zac Al-Khateeb</a></address>
      <p>For the second time this season, Oklahoma staved off an upset-minded opponent to keep its Big 12 and College Football Playoff hopes alive. And for the second time, that win came in controversial fashion.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, the victory was secured after an iffy spot by officials, who awarded Sooners quarterback Jalen Hurts a first down that allowed Oklahoma to run the clock out instead of punting the ball to TCU for one final drive.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma ended up winning 28-24 and securing a berth in a fourth consecutive Big 12 championship game (2010, 2017-19).</p>

      </p>
      <p>Here's a replay of the pivotal spot. The video seems to show Hurts was stopped well short of the line to gain on third down.</p>

      <p>Officials gave Hurts the first down on the field and, after a lengthy review, said the call on the field stood. It was yet another controversial call by Big 12 officials in an OU game; refs failed to call <a href="https://twitter.com/si_ncaafb/status/1193389841234436096">what looked to be defensive pass interference</a> by Oklahoma on Iowa State's 2-point conversion attempt in the final seconds of the Sooners' 42-41 win on Nov. 9.</p>
      <p>Regardless, Oklahoma advanced to 10-1 (7-1 Big 12) with the victory. Hurts finished the game with 318 combined yards and four touchdowns (and two turnovers that nearly cost his team dearly).</p>
      <p>Here are some of the reactions from the controversial first-down spot:</p>
