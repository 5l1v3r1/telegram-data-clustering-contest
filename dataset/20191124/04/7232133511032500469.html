      <h3>Bitcoin Price Weekly Analysis (BTC)</h3>
      <p>This past week, bitcoin started a nasty decline below the $8,000 support area against the US Dollar. As a result, BTC price gained bearish momentum below the $7,800 support and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
      <p>It opened the doors for more losses and the price even declined sharply below the $7,500 support. Moreover, the price tested the $7,000 support area (the first <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/19/bitcoin-medium-term-outlook-here-is-why-btc-could-test-6-5k/">bearish target as per the medium term outlook</a>).</p>
      <p>Finally, the price spiked below $6,900 and a new multi-month low was formed near the $6,776 level. At the outset, bitcoin price is correcting higher and recently traded above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,213 high to $6,776 low.</p>
      <p>However, the upward correction is facing resistance near the $7,400 level. Additionally, there is another breakdown pattern forming with support near $7,240 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
      <p>If there is a downside break below $7,240 and $7,200, there are <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/22/bitcoin-btc-reaches-crucial-support-at-7-4k-larger-decline-in-play/">chances of more downsides</a> in the near term. In the mentioned case, the price is likely to break the $7,000 support and $6,800 level. The main target for the bears seem to be the $6,500 support area.</p>
      <p>On the upside, the price must break the triangle resistance and $7,400. Besides, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,213 high to $6,776 low is near the $7,500 level.</p>
      <p>The key resistance is near the $7,550 level and a connecting bearish trend line on the same chart. A clear break above the $7,500 and $7,550 resistance levels could set the pace for more gains.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XBTUSD/">chart</a>, bitcoin price is likely setting up for another breakdown below the $7,200 and $7,000 support levels. Conversely, a close above $7,550 is needed for a correction towards the $8,000 level in the coming days.</p>
