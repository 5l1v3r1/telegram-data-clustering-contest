      <h2>The Sunday Mail launches a Leave the Keys campaign as statistics reveal the number of culprits getting behind the wheel drunk in Scotland has increased.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Hyland</a></address>
      <p>Families of loved ones who lost their lives to drink-drivers have united to condemn a shocking new rise in the crime.</p>
      <p>Statistics revealed by the Sunday Mail today show the number of culprits getting behind the wheel drunk in Scotland has increased, despite repeated campaigns to eradicate the offence.</p>
      <p>Today, three families whose lives have been wrecked by drink-drivers speak out to appeal to people to do more to stop the offence.</p>
      <p>Police Scotland has urged people to shop friends, family members and partners if they suspect them of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/drink-driving">driving drunk.</a></p>
      <p>They will launch their own official campaign this week.</p>
      <p>Ministers reduced the alcohol limit for drivers from 80 milligrammes per 100ml of blood to 50mg – or 22 micrograms (mcg) from <br/>35mcg of alcohol in 100ml of breath – in 2014.</p>
      <p>But statistics released by the force on Friday show officers detained 3092 motorists for being over the threshold between April and September.</p>
      <p>The finding represented an increase of 5.3 per cent over the same period in 2018 when 2935 drivers were held.</p>

      <p>A senior police officer has urged people to report friends and family suspected of drink-driving.</p>
      <p>Superintendent Louise Blakelock, deputy head of road policing, is disappointed that a high number of motorists continue to ignore warnings not to drive after drinking.</p>
      <p>Figures show the number of drivers caught by officers this year is up by more than five per cent on 2018.</p>
      <p>Statistics made public on Friday included motorists who tested positive for drugs and those who failed to provide a breath test.</p>
      <p>Supt Blakelock, who will spearhead Police Scotland’s crackdown on drink-driving this year, said: “We’d encourage the public to contact the police if they have a friend, relative or colleague who they know or suspect is drink-driving.</p>
      <p>“This can be done anonymously without giving your name and address. Ultimately, you’re keeping your friend or family member safe if you have the courage to phone. But you’re also keeping other road users safe.”</p>
      <p>In 2014, the Scottish Government reduced the alcohol limit for drivers from 80mg per 100ml of blood to 50mg.</p>
      <p>Blakelock said: “We’ve not seen a huge increase in detections at the new limit. What we are seeing are people who are four, five or six times over the limit. But our message at this time of year is there’s no safe limit.”</p>
      <p>Blakelock also warned about the dangers of getting behind the wheel the morning after a night out. She added: “You don’t want to risk getting behind the wheel if you’ve been drinking to the early hours.”</p>

      <p>Charles Pease’s partner <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/the-world-just-ended-vets-20946581">Theresa Wade died</a> on the isle of Mull when she was involved in a smash.</p>
      <p>And Julie Taylor, who compared the collision to a bomb explosion, was trapped inside her vehicle <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/newlywed-left-heartbroken-after-death-20946849">beside dead husband Colin</a> after a crash near Dundee.</p>
      <p>Martin, 44, said: “We hope by sharing our story people will stop and think. If you choose to drink and drive, it could be your mum next time, your sister or even you.”</p>
      <p>Charles, 64, said: “It’s as if someone had taken a swing at my legs with a baseball bat. It hit my mind, my heart, it hit everything. The world ended.”</p>
      <p>Julie, 55, said: “I’m disgusted people still drink and drive.”</p>
      <p>Superintendent Louise Blakelock, deputy head of road policing, said: “Unfortunately, drink-driving continues to be an issue and is across all age groups. That’s despite various campaigns highlighting the tragic outcomes that can happen if you drink and drive.”</p>
      <p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “Just one case of drink-driving is one case too many. There must be zero-tolerance of this.”</p>
