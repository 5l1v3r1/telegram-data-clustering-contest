Considering he was returning from a lengthy layoff, drawn appallingly and forced to run on from near last most recently, the fact he was only beaten two lengths by Brass Bell suggests he is a decent sort.

      <p>Greyville Turf 24-11-19</p>
      <p>Best Bet</p>
      <p>Race 9 No 5 Baby Shooz</p>
      <p>On betting alone, Baby Shooz – backed to even money favourite – should have absolutely no trouble outclassing rivals when he teams up with multiple champion jockey Anton Marcus, over a 1600m trip that should suit him perfectly.</p>
      <p>Considering he was returning from a lengthy layoff, drawn appallingly and forced to run on from near last most recently, the fact he was only beaten two lengths by Brass Bell suggests he is a decent sort.</p>
      <p>Now that he is beautifully drawn at No 3 and will strip a fitter horse, this son of Jackson should be very hard to peg back.</p>
      <p>Bargain Bet</p>
      <p>Race 8 No 2 Railtrip</p>
      <p>Railtrip was believed to be a future star in the beginning of her career and although she didn’t live up to the hype, she looks good value for money today.</p>
      <p>She caught the eye when runner-up last time out.</p>
      <p>She was badly drawn on that occasion and it did not help that she was reported to be coughing in running. Even with all these disadvantages she fought all the way to the finish line and was beaten no more than a nose by Bank Robber.</p>
      <p>Railtrip is actually unbeaten over this distance. If she brings her best form to the course, all those who remain faithful could be decently rewarded with a decent pay check.</p>
