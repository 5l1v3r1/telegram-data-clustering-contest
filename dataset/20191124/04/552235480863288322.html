      <p>Parcel giant DPD has ordered contractors to stop fining drivers for ­calling in sick.</p>
      <p>It comes after we highlighted the case of driver Mark Barnes, 34, who was given £150 penalties for missing deliveries when he rushed to his wife’s hospital bed after she had emergency surgery.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/amazon-driver-owed-unpaid-wages-20469052">DPD</a> had promised to end the practice after one of its <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/amazon-driver-owed-unpaid-wages-20469052">drivers</a>, Don Lane, died in 2018.</p>
      <p>Don, 53, missed numerous hospital appointments for fear of being hit with the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/amazon-driver-owed-unpaid-wages-20469052">charge</a>.</p>
      <p>Ken Loach’s latest film, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/amazon-driver-owed-unpaid-wages-20469052">Sorry We Missed You</a>, tells the stories of delivery drivers like Don to shine a light on the gig economy.</p>
      <p>Last week, we told how <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/delivery-firm-dpd-orders-contractors-20944477">dad-of-four Mark</a> was issued with six £150 penalties by DPD’s sister courier ­organisation, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/amazon-driver-owed-unpaid-wages-20469052">DPD </a>Local, in four years – the latest coming just before he quit in October.</p>
      <p>DPD and DPD Local have similar logos, branding and have the same chief executive, Dwain McDonald, who earns about £1million a year.</p>
      <p>Midlands-based DPD group insisted it was unaware DPD Local was fining workers.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: “DPD ­abolished fines completely for its self-employed drivers in February 2018. Mark Barnes was not employed or engaged by DPD.</p>
      <p>"He was a self-employed driver who worked for a franchisee of DPD Local, a separate business to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/amazon-driver-owed-unpaid-wages-20469052">DPD</a>.</p>
      <p>"The DPD Local franchisees remain independent of DPD – they run their own businesses.</p>
      <p>"As soon as it was brought to our attention, DPD wrote to all its suppliers to reinforce again that no driver should be penalised in this way.”</p>
