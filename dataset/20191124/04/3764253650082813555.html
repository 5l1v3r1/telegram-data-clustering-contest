      <p>Real Madrid survived Real Sociedad's scare after coming from a goal down to beat their visitors 3-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu in late La Liga fixture.</p>
      <p>Los Blancos conceded just after two minutes of action through a Willian Jose's stunning strike to hand the away team the lead.</p>
      <p>The visitors tried as much as possible to double their lead but all efforts failed to materialise until the home tea gained momentum.</p>
