      <h1>Voice of the Mirror: The hospital overcrowding crisis is going from bed to worse</h1>
      <h2>An alarming 200,000 hospital beds are being lost from delayed discharges but unfortunately the right resources are not in place to discharge them</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Voice of the Mirror, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/voice-of-the-mirror/</a></address>
      <p>With flu season about to hit full swing it’s alarming to hear there are 200,000 hospital beds lost from delayed discharges.</p>
      <p>And these are spaces that will no doubt be needed when serious cases of the illness start emerging.</p>
      <p>Figures from the HSE show the number of beds being blocked is on target for a 15% increase since last year.</p>
      <p>Health Minister Simon Harris needs to look at what can be done to reduce this damning number.</p>
      <p>There is a need for step-down care and home support in order to alleviate these scandalous numbers.</p>
      <p>It’s well known there are people currently occupying hospital beds that don’t need to be there, but unfortunately the right resources are not in place to discharge them.</p>

      <p>The minister should be pumping funds into services that allow patients to leave hospital when they are ready to do so.</p>
      <p>If the right support was there a vast majority of people would be able to cope and recover in the comfort of their own home.</p>
      <p>And rather than the situation getting better in time, it has got progressively worse in recent years.</p>
      <p>Something drastic needs to be done or lives will be lost as people needing emergency care are left without a bed in our overcrowded hospitals.</p>
