      <p>The Agence régionale de santé Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur (ARS Paca) <a href="https://www.paca.ars.sante.fr/cryptosporidiose-dans-les-alpes-maritimes-point-de-situation">is reporting (computer translated)</a> a Cryptosporodium outbreak in Grasse and several surrounding municipalities of the Alpes-Maritimes.</p>
      <p>Since October 7, at least 92 cases of diarrhea caused by a parasite. There is a suspicion of contamination in the Grasse sector, supplied with water by the Foulon canal (west of the Alpes-Maritimes), which could have been contaminated following heavy rainfall.</p>
      <p>Officials recommended as a precaution to drink only bottled water or to boil the tap water before consume it or use it to prepare food.</p>
      <p>“Investigations continue, but as long as there are new cases, the restrictions are kept as a precaution,” <a href="https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/sante/a-grasse-l-eau-du-robinet-deconseillee-apres-des-dizaines-de-cas-de-diarrhee_2108697.html">said the ARS</a>. “There are 92 cases of people infected with this parasite and suffering from symptoms similar to gastroenteritis and equally contagious”.</p>

      <p>Cryptosporidiosis is a diarrheal disease caused by a microscopic parasite called <i>Cryptosporidium</i>. The illnesses spread when people come into contact with fecal matter from an infected person or animal. The parasite is able to survive outside the human body for long periods of time and is highly resistant to chlorine.</p>

      <p>Symptoms of cryptosporidiosis often include watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting, loss of appetite, weight loss and low-grade fever. People typically become ill about a week after exposure, but this can range from two to 14 days. Most people recover in one to two weeks, but they will continue to shed the parasite in their stools for at least two weeks after symptoms end. Approximately 10 percent to 15 percent of cases require hospitalization for their illness. Illness can be especially severe or prolonged in people with weakened immune systems.</p>
