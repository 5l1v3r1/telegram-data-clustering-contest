      <h1>Thompson’s big night leads Kansas State to 30-27 win over Texas Tech</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:09:41+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:09</time> by <a rel="author">AP</a></address>
      <p>LUBBOCK, Texas — <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/joshua-youngblood-player-stats">Joshua Youngblood</a> returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown and <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/skylar-thompson-player-stats">Skylar Thompson</a> passed for 246 yards and two touchdowns as Kansas State beat Texas Tech 30-27 on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Youngblood fielded the kickoff one yard deep in the end zone midway through the third quarter, ran up the right side and covered the final 40 yards running just inches inside the right sideline, eluding multiple defenders.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/blake-lynch-2-player-stats">Blake Lynch</a> kicked two 32-yard field goals and a 43-yarder for Kansas State (7-4, 4-4 Big 12), which snapped a two-game losing streak.</p>
      <p>Thompson’s touchdown passes were 14 yards to <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/phillip-brooks-player-stats">Phillip Brooks</a> in the third quarter and 48 yards to <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/chabastin-taylor-2-player-stats">Chabastin Taylor</a> midway in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/sarodorick-thompson-2-player-stats">SaRodorick Thompson</a> had a 5-yard touchdown run and <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/jett-duffey-2-player-stats">Jett Duffey</a> passed for 334 yards and two touchdowns for Texas Tech (4-7, 2-6) which fell short of bowl eligibility. Duffey’s touchdown passes were 21 yards to <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/erik-ezukanma-2-player-stats">Erik Ezukanma</a> and 58 yards to R.J. Turner. <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/trey-wolff-2-player-stats">Trey Wolff</a> kicked field goals of 44 and 27 yards for the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/texas-tech-red-raiders-team">Red Raiders</a>.</p>
      <p>Youngblood, a freshman who went into play leading the conference averaging 29.5 yards per kickoff return, had a 98-yarder for a touchdown against Texas on Nov. 9. Kansas State has returned three kickoffs for touchdowns this season.</p>
      <p>THE TAKEAWAY</p>
      <p>Kansas State: The Wildcats rebounded nicely following last week’s home loss against West Virginia after which some players said they took the Mountaineers lightly.</p>
      <p>Texas Tech: The Red Raiders aren’t going to a bowl for the second straight season. That hasn’t happened since the 1990-92 seasons in the Southwest Conference under Spike Dykes.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>Kansas State: Will host Iowa State next Saturday.</p>
      <p>Texas Tech: Will finish its season Friday at Texas, where it has won on its last two trips.</p>
