      <h1>NHS whistleblower reveals 10 more dirty water scandal cases after death of Milly Main</h1>
      <h2>The latest claims suggest seriously ill youngsters at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital have been falling victim to bugs since 2016.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Ferguson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-ferguson/</a></address>
      <p>The whistleblower who exposed the dirty water scandal linked to a 10-year-old girl’s death on a cancer ward has claimed to have identified 10 new cases.</p>
      <p>Their revelations suggest seriously ill youngsters at the £842million <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-nhs-board-subject-special-20938047">Queen Elizabeth University Hospital</a> (QEUH) – which only opened in April 2015 – have been falling victim to bugs since 2016.</p>
      <p>The insider approached Glasgow MSP <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-nhs-board-subject-special-20938047">Anas Sarwar</a> and told how an internal doctor-led inquiry focusing on 2017 found another 26 cases.</p>
      <p>The source said the probe, which was never made public, found a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-nhs-board-subject-special-20938047">stenotrophomonas</a> infection had to be considered as the cause of death in one of the children.</p>

      <p>Now the Sunday Mail can reveal the same contact has said a further 10 infection cases were also found in 2016.</p>
      <p>Sarwar said: “These latest revelations from an <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-nhs-board-subject-special-20938047">NHS whistleblower</a> show that the problems at this hospital have been going on for years. That begs the question why it has taken so long for action to be taken.</p>
      <p>“If cases were identified as early as 2016, why wasn’t that addressed then so infections in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-nhs-board-subject-special-20938047">2017</a> may have been avoided?</p>
      <p>“The priority now must be telling the truth to all 36 families affected in 2016 and 2017. That’s the very least they deserve following this scandal.”</p>
      <p>The deaths of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-nhs-board-subject-special-20938047">two children</a> have been linked to the outbreak at two wards in the campus’s Royal Hospital for Children (RHC).</p>
      <p>A report earlier this year found 23 patients with cancer had acquired infections linked to the water supply in 2018. The bacterium stenotrophomonas was connected to 12 of the cases.</p>
      <p>Kimberly Darroch believes her 10-year-old daughter <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-nhs-board-subject-special-20938047">Milly Main</a> died after catching an infection when in remission from cancer in the RHC in 2017. The <br/>devastated mum only discovered the truth when our sister paper the Daily Record revealed information given to Sarwar.</p>
      <p>Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has faced calls to resign. She has admitted that dirty water was the most likely cause of Milly’s death and has indicated that up to 150 youngsters could have been affected.</p>
      <p>The SNP minister has slammed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-nhs-board-subject-special-20938047">NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde</a>’s “appalling” handling of Milly’s case and turned on health bosses after they criticised the whistleblower.</p>
      <p>The health board was placed in “special measures” by Freeman last week, meaning an oversight board will be put in place chaired by chief nursing officer Professor Fiona McQueen.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: “The Health Secretary has instructed officials to urgently seek full details of the 2017 review carried out by NHS Greater Glasgow and to establish exactly what action the board took in response.”</p>
      <p>An NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde spokeswoman said: “Health Protection Scotland has been commissioned by the chief nursing officer to undertake a review of NHSGGC haemato-oncology data, which includes data from 2016, and this will be published next week.”</p>
