      <h1>An attitude change towards drink-driving is needed to stop number of deaths</h1>
      <h2>The Sunday Mail has launched a Leave the Keys campaign to urge people to not drink and drive.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mail Opinion, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mail-opinion/</a></address>
      <p>Seemingly impossible behavioural changes can be achieved with a bit of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/naked-nun-tights-fetish-murderer-20945025">ambition</a> and a lot of public will.</p>
      <p>Take the smoking ban.</p>
      <p>It would have been regarded as unthinkable 20 years ago that cigarettes could be taken out of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/naked-nun-tights-fetish-murderer-20945025">Scottish pubs</a>.</p>
      <p>People old enough to remember will recall critics describing the 2005 legislation leading to a ban a year later as unworkable.</p>
      <p>Now <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/naked-nun-tights-fetish-murderer-20945025">13 years on</a>, the ban has also been introduced in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/naked-nun-tights-fetish-murderer-20945025">England, Wales</a> and in countries across the world.</p>
      <p>The ban changed public attitudes to smoking. The sight of smokers standing outside the front doors of hospitals is a thing of the past.</p>
      <p>Incidences of smoking-related diseases are down and the air in our public buildings has literally cleared.</p>
      <p>Laws outlawing drink-driving are already in place but, depressingly, a crime which ought to be a relic of a bygone age remains with us.</p>
      <p>Anyone in any doubt about the wreckage caused by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/naked-nun-tights-fetish-murderer-20945025">drink-driving</a> should read the accounts given by families in today’s Sunday Mail.</p>
      <p>Because of one person’s selfish, disgusting decision to drink then get behind the wheel, their lives lie in tatters.</p>
      <p>Charles Pease recalled: “I went to bed and was awoken by police at 4am. I knew it wasn’t going to be good news but I assumed they were there about my elderly father.</p>
      <p>“Instead, the policewoman said to me, ‘Are you the partner of Theresa Wade and does she drive a white ­<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/naked-nun-tights-fetish-murderer-20945025">Citroen Berlingo</a> van?’ My blood ran cold. I had to sit down.</p>
      <p>“She went on to say, ‘I’m sorry to tell you that she was involved in a road traffic accident and as a consequence she died.’</p>
      <p>“It’s as if someone had taken a swing at my legs with a baseball bat. It hit my mind, my heart, it hit everything. The world just ended.”</p>
      <p>This is not a trivial crime. That’s why we’ve launched our Leave The Keys campaign ahead of the party season.</p>
      <p>The fact that there are any incidents at all means there still needs to be a change in attitudes towards the drink-drive culture.</p>
      <p>It has never been easier to leave the keys at home. In the age of the Uber and plentiful public transport options excuses are non-existent.</p>
      <p>Superintendent Louise <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/naked-nun-tights-fetish-murderer-20945025">Blakelock</a>, deputy head of road policing at Police Scotland, admits warnings to the public are being ignored.</p>
      <p>She calls for the friends, partners and families of drink-drivers to report them to the police – confidentially, if necessary.</p>
      <p>For many this is something of a taboo. Again it’s a cultural thing – nobody likes a tell-tale.</p>
      <p>But it isn’t just justifiable. It’s imperative.</p>
      <p>Anyone who turns a blind eye becomes complicit. There should not be a single second’s hesitation in reporting a drink-driver.</p>
      <p>The Scottish public can ensure that the abomination of a rise in statistics never happens again.</p>
