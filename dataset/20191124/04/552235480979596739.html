      <h1>Scots soldiers cleared over deaths of Iraqi prisoners face war crimes court probe</h1>
      <h2>The Black Watch veterans face a fresh investigation by prosecutors at the International Criminal Court in the Hague in Holland.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Norman Silvester, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/norman-silvester/</a></address>
      <p>Two Scottish soldiers cleared over the deaths of Iraqi prisoners could be prosecuted by an international <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/war-crimes">war crimes</a> court.</p>
      <p>The pair were among 11 British Army personnel investigated over the deaths in custody of taxi driver Rhadi Nama and teacher Abdul Jabbar Mousa Ali at Camp Stephen in Basra in May 2003.</p>
      <p>Both servicemen were told there would be no criminal proceedings against them in a military court after a lengthy probe by the Iraq Historic ­Allegations Team (IHAT).</p>
      <p>Now the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/black-watch">Black Watch</a> veterans, who are from Fife and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, face a fresh investigation by prosecutors at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague in Holland.</p>
      <p>It would be the first time the ICC has taken action against any UK nationals for war crimes should the hearings go ahead.</p>
      <p>Shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti last week said all alleged abuse by troops in Afghanistan and Iraq should be examined by the ICC.</p>
      <p>The court exercises its power when a country is unwilling or unable to prosecute criminals.</p>
      <p>In a broadcast on Monday, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bbc">BBC’s Panorama</a> claimed to have found new evidence that the Army had covered up killings and abuse of civilians by UK troops in Iraq and Afghanistan – including at Camp Stephen.</p>
      <p>The programme also detailed the abuse leading up to the deaths of Nama and Ali, who were suspected insurgents.</p>
      <p>The Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC declined to comment on any specific allegations of abuse, including the deaths of the two men.</p>

      <p>But a spokeswoman said: “The Panorama findings concerning alleged war crimes by UK troops could be highly relevant to the Office’s ongoing work and examination.</p>
      <p>“The Office will independently and objectively assess the findings in accordance with the applicable legal criteria under the Rome Statute – the founding treaty of the ICC.”</p>
      <p>Matthew Berlow, solicitor for the two Scottish soldiers, said he would fight any attempts by the ICC to bring them to trial.</p>
      <p>He added: “My clients have had these allegations hanging over them for many years and they have been unable to get on with their lives.</p>
      <p>“They have already been the subject of lengthy investigation by the military police and IHAT.</p>
      <p>“The prosecution authorities obtained independent legal advice regarding the original evidence against my clients from senior lawyers who recommended no proceedings.</p>
      <p>We were able to point out flaws and procedural irregularities in the same evidence and how it was obtained. I will robustly defend my clients against any attempt to prosecute them.”</p>
      <p>The two soldiers were members of Black Watch C Company, who were based at Camp Stephen for four months. Neither has been named.</p>
      <p>The deceased had been taken into custody and died at Camp Stephen in what were described as “suspicious circumstances”.</p>
      <p>The soldiers were interviewed during a probe by the military police’s Special Investigations Branch but no action was taken.</p>

      <p>The Fife soldier, a private, was investigated over the death of Nama, who had a heart attack. It was alleged the prisoner had been subjected to extreme abuse.</p>
      <p>The second soldier, a warrant officer from Edinburgh, was questioned about Ali, who was found dead with multiple injuries.</p>
      <p>A fresh probe into both deaths was launched in 2010 when the then government set up IHAT.</p>
      <p>The private from Fife was told he was a suspect in 2016 and ­interviewed three times at police stations in ­Levenmouth, Fife, and Falkirk.</p>
      <p>The second soldier was quizzed by IHAT at Levenmouth in 2017.</p>
      <p>IHAT investigated about 3500 claims of abuse. Not one probe resulted in a successful prosecution.</p>
      <p>The MoD said: “The UK has complied fully with the ICC’s requests for information about legal processes in respect of alleged war crimes and sees no justification for any further interventions by the ICC.”</p>
