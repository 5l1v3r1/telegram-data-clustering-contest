      <h1>Spurs news: Mourinho's Eriksen talks, apology to the fans, Vertonghen injury update</h1>
      <h2>All the latest news from around Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as Jose Mourinho enjoys first win in charge</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lee Wilmot</a></address>
      <p>The Jose Mourinho era got off to a winning start on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Spurs dominated proceedings against an insipid West Ham at the London Stadium and some better finishing and not switching off defensively and they would have won more comfortably than the 3-2 final scoreline.</p>
      <p>There is plenty for new boss Jose Mourinho to work on, but he will have been pleased with certain aspects of the match, particularly the control the side had in the first hlf.</p>
      <p>Here we round-up the biggest news stories from around the club in the past 24 hours.</p>
      <h3>Mourinho apology</h3>
      <p>When you've won your first game in charge at your new club, apologising to the fans is not exactly top of the agenda.</p>
      <p>But that is what Jose Mourinho has done to the Tottenham fans.</p>

      <p>There are still plenty of things to work on after a 3-2 defeat of West Ham, but for Mourinho, after just three days with the squad, it was a good start.</p>
      <p>So it may come as a surprise that the former Chelsea and Manchester United boss felt the need to apologise to the supporters, and not for the two late goals they conceded either.</p>

      <h3>Vertonghen update</h3>
      <p>Jan Vertonghen has been out of action since October 22.</p>
      <p>That is down to a mixture of not being picked by Mauricio Pochettino and a hamstring problem.</p>

      <p>But the Belgian defender is on the road to recovery.</p>
      <p>And Jose Mourinho has revealed when the 32-year-old will return to training and be available for selection in his first team.</p>

      <h3>Amazing moment</h3>
      <p>There were some real positives to come out of the win over West Ham on Saturday.</p>
      <p>And Mourinho will pick apart the negative aspects of the match too and analyse just what went wrong.</p>

      <p>There was one "amazing" moment during the game though, that led to one of the Tottenham goals.</p>

      <h3>Christian Eriksen hint</h3>
      <p>Christian Eriksen came off the bench late on during the game at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>He showed some nice touches and looked better than he had done under Mauricio Pochettino in recent weeks.</p>

      <p>But the fact he was on the bench and not in the starting lineup spoke volumes.</p>
      <p>Has he already had the big conversation with Mourinho?</p>
