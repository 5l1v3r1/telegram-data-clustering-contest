      <h1>Mum forced to smuggle cannabis oil to treat son slams health chiefs for 'moving goalposts'</h1>
      <h2>Former police officer Lisa Quarrell had previously risked jail when she began smuggling in medicinal cannabis from the Netherlands to treat Cole for seizures.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Blackstock</a></address>
      <p>A mum who pays £840 a month for cannabis medicine to treat her son has claimed the family’s GP has been blocked from prescribing the drug on the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nhs-scotland">NHS</a>.</p>
      <p>Lisa Quarrell, 38, has accused health officials and the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-government">Scottish Government</a> of “moving the goalposts” over covering the cost of seven-year-old Cole’s <br/>treatment.</p>
      <p>She said she has just two months of savings left to pay privately for epilepsy drug Bedrolite, which has transformed her boy’s life.</p>
      <p>Medical guidelines – published by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) – earlier this month should allow Cole to get Bedrolite on an NHS prescription, Lisa claims.</p>

      <p>But after it was legalised, a private doctor in London has been prescribing Bedrolite to Cole since March, resulting in him being seizure-free for more than 230 days.</p>
      <p>NICE’s new “shared care” guidelines say after an initial prescription by a doctor, cannabis-based medicine can subsequently be prescribed by <br/>the NHS.</p>
      <p>And mum-of-two Lisa, from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a>, says her GP has been keen to take over the costly burden, which she says is now “unsustainable”.</p>
      <p>But the doctor has been blocked by her health board, NHS Lanarkshire, which says the NICE guidance does not cover Scotland.</p>
      <p>Health Secretary Jeane Freeman told her last month that the NICE guidelines would see a Scottish equivalent drafted up “if appropriate”.</p>
      <p>In a moving letter sent to Freeman, Lisa says Bedrolite has led to a “remarkable transformation” of Cole’s life.</p>
      <p>She said: “I don’t have to repeat to you what it costs us every month just to keep Cole alive, which is now becoming unsustainable.</p>
      <p>“I am being lied to. My son’s prescription for Bedrolite medicine is actively being blocked.</p>
      <p>“You will continue to move the goalposts every time I find an access route to an NHS prescription for Cole.</p>
      <p>“While you all continue to play a political version of pass the parcel, I’m left to pick up the pieces of your failings.</p>

      <p>“What chance do me and my son have when you all keep changing the rules to suit yourselves?”</p>
      <p>Labour’s health spokeswoman Monica Lennon said: “Lisa is to be commended for her fight. She is following the facts and it seems the goalposts are being moved.</p>
      <p>The fact GPs and clinicians are being undermined by bureaucratic decisions is frustrating.”</p>
      <p>Bernie McCreadie, of Medicinal Cannabis Reform Scotland, said: “Doctors want to help their patients with the use of medicinal cannabis in Scotland but they’re being blocked by NHS boards and the Scottish Government.”</p>
      <p>NICE’s guidance is only legal in England and Wales but can be binding in Scotland and is often replicated here.</p>
      <p>Christine Gilmour, director of pharmacy for NHS Lanarkshire, said: “We are aware of the recent NICE guidelines published in England on the use of cannabis-based products.</p>
      <p>We await advice following the chief pharmaceutical officer’s dialogue with Healthcare Improvement Scotland.”</p>
      <p>Healthcare Improvement Scotland said: “The guideline published around the use of cannabis-based products, as with all other advice from NICE, will be of use to clinicians in Scotland in informing the best care for their patients but has no formal status.”</p>
