      <h1>Chelsea news: Lampard's plan to challenge Liverpool and Man City, two players at fault</h1>
      <h2>All the latest news from around Stamford Bridge as Chelsea lose out to Man City</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T04:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lee Wilmot</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea's long winning streak has been ended.</p>
      <p>But it was ended by champions Manchester City.</p>
      <p>The Blues dropped to fourth in the Premier League table as a result of the defeat, but there were plenty of positives to take from the defeat.</p>
      <p>Chelsea lost the corresponding game 6-0 under Maurizio Sarri last season - so this was a huge improvement.</p>
      <p>And the improvements the side are making under Frank Lampard are there to see with each passing week.</p>
      <p>We round-up all the biggest news stories from around the Blues camp from the past 24 hours below.</p>
      <h3>Players at fault</h3>
      <p>Chelsea were unlucky not to claim at least a point against Manchester City at the Etihad on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard's side opened the scoring against Manchester City, when N'Golo Kante steered an effort underneath Ederson.</p>

      <p>But a deflected Kevin de Bruyne shot and a Riyad Mahrez effort turned the tables before half-time and City maintained that 2-1 lead in the second half.</p>
      <p>And that Mahrez goal could have been avoided, with two players singled out for criticism.</p>

      <h3>Guardiola praise</h3>
      <p>Chelsea had more possession than Manchester City on Saturday - in City's own back yard.</p>
      <p>It is not often that happens to the champions.</p>
      <p>Although manager Pep Guardiola believes it could become a more regular occurrence.</p>

      <p>But for two lapses, Chelsea might have taken something from the Saturday evening kick-off.</p>
      <p>And Guardiola reserved special praise for the Blues.</p>

      <h3>Making the next step</h3>
      <p>Before the game at the Etihad, Chelsea were being talked up as potential title challengers if they could take something away from CIty.</p>
      <p>But they didn't so where does that leave Frank Lampard's side now?</p>

      <p>Lampard is only in his first year in the Premier League, so challenging for the title might be out of reach right now, but how long could it take to get up to City and Liverpool's standard?</p>
      <p>Taking that next step is the key thing on the agenda.</p>
