      <p>Manchester United dropped points once again in the Premier League as they were held to a dramatic 3-3 draw by Sheffield United at Bramall Lane on Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/108374/John-Fleck">John Fleck</a> gave the Blades an early advantage, with <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/198773/Lys-Mousset">Lys Mousset</a> doubling their advantage early in the second half. A remarkable seven-minute comeback from the Red Devils saw them take the lead courtesy of goals from <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/249501/Brandon-Williams">Brandon Williams</a>, <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/276221/Mason-Greenwood">Mason Greenwood</a> and <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/230945/Marcus-Rashford">Marcus Rashford</a>, only for <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/193010/Oliver-McBurnie">Oliver McBurnie</a> to snatch a point for the home side late in the game.</p>
      <h3>Positives</h3>
      <p>Breaking away on the counter seems to be a tactic that Manchester United are implementing more and more as the season goes on, and they're certainly getting better at it. They're also starting to surge down the flanks more as opposed to attempting to walk the ball into the back of the net.</p>
      <h3>Negatives</h3>
      <p>The spaces that they leave at the back are painful to see at times, and with nobody really taking the initiative, these issues are going to keep happening. They're far too sloppy on the ball, too, which often hurts them when trying to build up a nice move possession wise.</p>
      <h3>Manager rating out of 10</h3>
      <p><b>6 --</b> Ole Gunnar Solskjaer set up his United side in a manner that ensured it'd be incredibly difficult to pump the ball up to the front three. He continues to look tactically naive in the first half of games, failing to showcase the kind of leadership necessary to guide this team towards bigger and better things. With that being said, his changes in the second half seemed to inspire the comeback.</p>
      <h3>Player ratings (1-10; 10 = best. Players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating)</h3>
      <p><b>GK David De Gea, 7 --</b> Produced a fantastic double save to prevent Sheffield United early on and seems to have regained the confidence in goal that he's lacked this year.</p>
      <p><b>DF <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/204679/Victor-Lindel%C3%B6f">Victor Lindelof</a>, 5 --</b> Always seems to panic beyond belief when it comes to making any kind of decision off the ball, and certainly lived up to that today.</p>
      <p><b>DF <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/157073/Harry-Maguire">Harry Maguire</a>, 5 --</b> Really struggled with the physicality of this Blades team, to the point where he had many fans questioning his price tag once again.</p>
      <p><b>DF <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/140032/Phil-Jones">Phil Jones</a>, 4 --</b> Was constantly looking for a foul to the frustration of United supporters, and was at the heart of why the hosts were able to take the lead.</p>

      <p><b>DF <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/250945/Aaron-Wan-Bissaka">Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a>, 6 --</b> You could be forgiven for thinking that Wan-Bissaka wasn't even playing today, as his poor positioning ensured he barely even got a touch of the ball.</p>
      <p><b>DF Brandon Williams, 7 --</b> Still seems to be a bit off the pace and needs more time to grow into a permanent Premier League role. Did manage to get on the score sheet to begin United's comeback.</p>
      <p><b>MF <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/210143/Andreas-Pereira">Andreas Pereira</a>, 5 --</b> Losing the ball in key positions is becoming far too regular of an occurrence for Pereira, and he did so again in the lead-up to Sheffield United's second goal.</p>
      <p><b>MF Fred, 5 --</b> Total lack of awareness for what's happening around him causes Manchester United so many headaches. Takes one step forward then two steps back.</p>
      <p><b>MF <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/203072/Daniel-James">Daniel James</a>, 7 --</b> Was arguably the most ineffective player in the whole team in the first half. Came into his own during United's comeback and set up their second goal.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>FW Marcus Rashford, 7 --</b> Much like James, he struggled in the first 45 minutes, but was key to getting United back into the game with a goal and an assist.</p>
      <p><b>FW <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/181140/Anthony-Martial">Anthony Martial</a>, 6 --</b> Shifts the ball out of his feet well, but was the least influential out of the three attacking threats in the game.</p>
      <h3>Substitutions</h3>
      <p><b>MF <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/169136/Jesse-Lingard">Jesse Lingard</a>, 6 --</b> Had more of a spark than he has done in recent months, but still has questionable decision making.</p>
      <p><b>FW Mason Greenwood, N/R --</b> Scored and looked like the liveliest member of United's side after coming onto the pitch.</p>
      <p><b>DF <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/229524/Axel-Tuanzebe">Axel Tuanzebe</a>, N/R --</b> Seemed to struggle after being thrown on late in the game.</p>
