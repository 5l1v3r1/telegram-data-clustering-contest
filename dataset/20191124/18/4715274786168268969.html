      <h1>SSS collects P30.5m from erring employers</h1>

      <p>State-run pension fund Social Security System has collected over P30.5 million in contribution delinquencies from 71 employers who were served with assessment notices by its branches. </p>
      <p>SSS president and chief executive Aurora Ignacio said over the weekend the employers settled their delinquencies after being served with Preliminary Assessment Notices and Final Assessment Notices Before Seizure under the process of serving Warrants of Distraint, Levy, and Garnishment. </p>
      <p>“This is only an initial collection as we have identified 93 other employers with combined contribution delinquencies amounting to nearly P200 million,” Ignacio said.</p>
      <p>Serving assessment notices are the initial procedures of the SSS’ WDLG Program. These are given to delinquent or non-compliant employers to offer them the option to either settle their delinquencies, avail of an installment payment scheme or file a request for reconsideration or reconciliation. Failure to avail of any of the methods will lead to the issuance of WDLG. </p>
