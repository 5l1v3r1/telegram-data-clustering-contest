      <h1>Apex Legends' Pathfinder and Wraith are still too overpowered, says these Apex Legends players</h1>
      <h2>While 91% of respondents think Mirage needs a serious buff.</h2>

      <p>An unofficial survey has identified which characters should be better balanced in Respawn's free-to-play battle royale, Apex Legends.</p>
      <p>The survey - which took the views of 1936 players after it was shared across EA's forums and Apex-flavoured subreddits - asked players to rank Legends on their performance thus far in season 3. Of the views taken, 91 per cent of respondents thought Mirage needed a buff with his passive ability, Encore, considered a huge flaw, whilst 63 per cent suggested the game's solo technological tracker, Bloodhound, was also underpowered. Crypto, Wattson and Octane were all considered a little weak, too.</p>
      <p>Conversely, Pathfinder, Wraith and Gibraltar - in that order - were thought to be the most overpowered. 77 per cent of respondents thought Pathfinder's tactical ability was just too OP, whilst 72 per cent thought Wraith had a "too good hitbox".</p>
      <p>Bangalore and Lifeline were considered the most balanced of the squad, with 83 and 85 per cent of respondents stating they were happy with their skills and abilities respectively.</p>

      <p>For the full survey results - which, at the time of writing, have yet to receive a comment from Respawn devs - head on over to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/e0y70t/buff_or_nerf_season_3_community_survey_results/">Reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://dotesports.com/apex-legends/news/apex-fan-survey-reveals-what-legends-may-need-balancing">dotesports</a>).</p>
      <p>In other Apex Legends news, "by popular request" Apex Legends developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-10-13-test-out-new-characters-guns-and-mods-with-apex-legends-upcoming-firing-range">Respawn recently introduced a new training ground called firing range</a> which gives players the opportunity to try out not just armour and abilities, but Apex's fine selection of firearms and attachments, too.</p>
      <p>As Emma recently reported, bemused players have uploaded videos showing themselves being punched in the dark, along with some entertaining footage showing knocked-out teammates flailing as they fall through the air. According to the perpetrators, all it takes is to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-06-apex-legends-bug-lets-players-brawl-before-a-match">spam melee immediately after selecting a Legend</a> - although the time window before the match starts only allows for one person to be knocked out. Some players have even claimed to have used this on teammates - despite Apex Legends not having friendly fire.</p>
