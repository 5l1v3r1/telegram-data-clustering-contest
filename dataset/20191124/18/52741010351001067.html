      <h1>Drayton Entertainment spreading holiday cheer with festive musical</h1>
      <h2>Elf: The Musical will be on stage at the Hamilton Family Theatre Cambridge from Nov. 20th to Dec. 22nd</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:50:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:50</time> by <a rel="author">Ariel Deutschmann</a></address>
      <p>Just in time for the holidays, Drayton Entertainment has announced Elf: The Musical will be performing in Waterloo Region.</p>
      <p>Drayton says the family-friendly musical will run this year at the Hamilton Family Theatre Cambridge from Nov. 20th to Dec. 22nd.</p>
      <p>Elf is the story of one of Santa's helpers named Buddy, who goes on a journey of self-discovery after he questions if he really is an elf based on his enormous size and poor toy making abilities. </p>
      <p>The story is considered by some to be 'one of the greatest Christmas movies ever made' after new Line Cinema introduced the film in theatres in 2003.</p>
      <p>Tim Porter, the actor who plays Buddy in the musical, says he knew right away he wanted to audition for the role.</p>
      <p>"I loved the movie, I love Will Ferrell." says Porter, "The script is very fun and great. I empathize with the character a lot. I feel quite similar to Buddy. I'm a happy-go-lucky kind of guy and was very naive as a young person."</p>
      <p>According to Porter, when he found out he got the role he was overjoyed.</p>
      <p>"I was over the moon." he says.</p>
      <p>Porter says he and the cast spent a year preparing for the show, which is an extra hour longer than the movie due to the musical numbers.</p>
      <p>He says really enjoys performing the song 'Just Like Him' and 'Nobody Cares About Santa,' which is performed in the second half of the show.</p>
      <p>"It's me with a bunch of Santa's and we do a tap dance." says Porter, talking about the song Nobody Cares About Santa. "It's more of a jazzy, really nitty-gritty performance."</p>
      <p>While the actor has played diverse roles in past performances of Snow White and Jack in the Beanstalk, he says playing Buddy was more fun than challenging.</p>
      <p>"I think just because he's such a joyful character, and he's so full of love and so honest, it just makes it really easy and fun." says Porter.</p>
      <p>"I just took the character for what it was in the script." says Porter, "Me and the director [Michael Lichtefeld] both agree the goal was to be honest."</p>
      <p>Porter says he has worked with Drayton for eight seasons and enjoys working with the theatre company and their artistic director, Alex Mustakas. </p>
      <p>"I've toured all over North America and there's no other company that rivals the family environment of this company. It's fantastic." says Porter, "And I love working with Alex. He's a brilliant man and there's so much you can learn from him. "</p>
      <p>"In a time when a lot of Canadian musical theatres are shutting down, he just continues to grow and grow."</p>
      <p>Residents who plan on seeing Elf: the Musical can expect a festive evening, according to Porter.</p>
      <p>"The whole show is really fun and every song is fun to perform." says Porter, "It's just a great two hours."</p>
      <p>With a talented cast and crew who have come from New York and Scarborough for this production, Porter says residents are getting a good deal.</p>
      <p>"It's a remarkable group of people and definitely worth the price of admission. " says Porter, "We have the best of the best in Canadian talent."</p>
      <p>Tickets for Elf: The Musical cost $48 for adults and $29 for youth under 20.</p>
