      <h1>Fans set to be allowed to stand at all-seater stadia in England for first time since Hillsborough disaster</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:41:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/ben-rumsby0/" target="_blank">Ben Rumsby</a></address>
      <p>Fans are set to be allowed to stand at all-seater stadia in England for the first time since the Hillsborough disaster after the Conservatives promised to introduce “safe standing” in their General Election manifesto.</p>
      <p>The Tories on Sunday joined Labour and the Liberal Democrats in making the pledge, having previously refused to commit to doing so.</p>
      <p>Standing during matches played at all-seater grounds was banned following Hillsborough but fans have been campaigning for years to be allowed to do so in so-called safe-standing areas.</p>
      <p>The Conservative manifesto said the party would “work with fans and clubs towards introducing safe standing”.</p>
      <p>It also pledged to “set up a fan-led review of football governance, which will include consideration of the Owners and Directors Test” in an apparent response to the tragic demise of Bury Football Club.</p>

      <p>And it promised to establish a “£150 million Community Ownership Fund” to encourage local takeovers of under-threat organisations or community assets, including “local football clubs”.</p>
      <p>Labour manifesto had already promised a review of English football following the demise of Bury, including of its owners’ and directors’ tests.</p>
      <p>It also repeated it 2017 manifesto pledge to “legislate for accredited football supporters’ trusts to be able to appoint and remove at least two club directors and purchase shares when clubs change hands”.</p>
      <p>But its most eye-catching promise <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/11/21/cricket-world-cup-return-free-to-air-television-labour-government/">was to return the Cricket World Cup to free-to-air television</a> following England’s epic triumph in the tournament this summer.</p>
      <p>The Conservative manifesto did not match that pledge.</p>
