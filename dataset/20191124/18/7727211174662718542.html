      <p>A "mother's instinct" helped doctors discover that her tiny baby had multiple holes in her heart.</p>
      <p>Harley, who is just 11-weeks-old, is currently in intensive care in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/alder-hey-childrens-hospital">Alder Hey</a> waiting on open heart surgery to fix her "unusual" <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/health/">heart condition</a> .</p>
      <p>Her parents, Jade Johnson and Charlie Short, have not left their first born's side since she was admitted to hospital and say they are preparing to spend her first <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/nhs">Christmas in hospital</a> .</p>
      <p>Mum Jade, told the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> that she knew from Harley was born, on September 6, that something was wrong and spent five weeks trying to convince doctors.</p>

      <p>The 23-year-old, from Wigan, said: "She was breathing really quickly, I knew something wasn't right.</p>
      <p>"I went to the doctors and they just kept reassuring me that it was normal for a newborn's breathing to be slightly abnormal and it was nothing to worry about.</p>
      <p>"It still kept worrying me, I knew she needed to be checked out - like a mother's instinct."</p>
      <p>Jade and her partner Charlie, 23, took Harley to A&amp;E when she was just five weeks old and doctors discovered she had a murmur before an x-ray revealed she had an enlarged heart.</p>
      <p>Harley was referred to Alder Hey Children's Hospital as an outpatient and it was during an appointment here that doctor's found the tiny baby had two holes in her heart.</p>

      <p>Just days after the appointment, Harley stopped breathing at home and turned blue.</p>
      <p>Jade said: "We called an ambulance and the paramedics couldn't believe how blue she had gone.</p>
      <p>"She was rushed to hospital and doctors in Wigan spent more than five hours trying to stabilise her before we were transferred to Alder Hey again.</p>
      <p>"This was on November 10 and we have been here ever since."</p>
      <p>Doctor's have said that Harley's condition is unusual as the large hole in her heart is at the bottom and they would expect it to be at the top.</p>

      <p>Jade added: "She is deteriorating quicker than they would expect but hopefully she will be able to get the surgery this week.</p>
      <p>"She has had a virus for the last few days so once she is clear of that we should be ok to go ahead with it."</p>

      <p>Jade and Charlie are currently staying at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/alder-hey-childrens-hospital">Ronald McDonald House</a> in order to be as close as possible to Harley.</p>
      <p>The couple have said they are prepared to stay for as long as Harley needs to but the situation is costing them financially.</p>
      <p>Jade said: "We still have all our bills and rent to pay, plus we are in the process of moving home.</p>
      <p>"Me and Charlie are so grateful for everyone, including Alder Hey and Ronald McDonald House, that have helped us as it really has taken the pressure off and allowed us to focus all our energy on Harley."</p>
      <p>Jade's friend Felicity has set up a GoFundMe to help support the family through their difficult time.</p>
      <p>So far, almost Â£500 has been raised for Harley, Jade and Charlie - you can check out the GoFundMe page <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/get-better-soon-baby-harley?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unknown&amp;utm_campaign=comms_jjv7+get-better-soon-baby-harley">HERE</a> .</p>
      <p>Jade added: "We have been overwhelmed by the kindness show to us from the people who have donated.</p>
      <p>"It makes such a difference and we will never be able to repay them."</p>
