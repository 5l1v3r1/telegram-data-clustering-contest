      <p>He said on interrogation, the suspect admitted to killing the baby because she did not like her daughter getting married to the father of the baby.</p>
      <p>The police said the suspect confessed further that when she discovered that her daughter was pregnant, she made an attempt to terminate the pregnancy but her pastor warned her not to do so. She allegedly said she decided to wait for the baby to be delivered before carrying out her intention.</p>

      <p>The officer said the corpse of the baby had been deposited at Olabisi Onabanjo teaching hospital mortuary for autopsy, while the suspect has been transferred to the homicide section of the state criminal investigation and intelligence department for further investigation and prosecution.</p>
