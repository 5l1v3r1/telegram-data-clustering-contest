      <h1>Kaia Gerber and Pete Davidson Are Already Going to Weddings Together</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:46:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:46</time> by <a rel="author">Hilary Weaver</a></address>
      <p>Pete Davidson and Kaia Gerber are already publicly hot and heavy. On Saturday, they were seen <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29903687/kaia-gerber-and-pete-davidson-kissing-by-the-pool/">kissing by the pool in Miami</a>—and even teasing the camera a bit with some tongue action. Turns out, they were doing a lot more than getting in some pool time in Florida.</p>
      <p>They were in Miami to attend the wedding of a friend, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1096506/pete-davidson-and-kaia-gerber-look-effortlessly-elegant-as-they-attend-a-friend-s-wedding">E! reports.</a> Gerber wore a blue polka-dot dress that E! says is likely from Reformation, while Davidson joined her in a dapper suit. Gerber paired her look with a bright orange purse and black heels.</p>
      <p>Davidson and Gerber don't seem to be hiding their relationship in the shadows. They were seen out in New York City for a casual date night, and last Saturday, they went to the <i><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/pete-davidson-kaia-gerber-celebrate-his-birthday-at-snl-party/">Saturday Night Live</a></i><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/pete-davidson-kaia-gerber-celebrate-his-birthday-at-snl-party/"> cast party </a>together. Gerber reportedly bought Davidson a confetti cake from Magnolia Bakery that said "Happy birthday, Pete" in pink frosting.</p>
      <p>Since he and Ariana Grande <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29873806/pete-davidson-ariana-grande-paper-interview/">split last year,</a> Davidson has been making movies romantically. Davidson and <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i> star Margaret Qualley<a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29505089/pete-davidson-margaret-qualley-break-up/"> broke up</a> in October after a whirlwind romance. It was a quick blip of a relationship, and Qualley's mother, actress Andie MacDowell <a href="https://people.com/movies/andie-macdowell-margaret-qualley-pete-davidson-beautiful-relationship/">told </a><i><a href="https://people.com/movies/andie-macdowell-margaret-qualley-pete-davidson-beautiful-relationship/">People</a> </i>in September that she didn't want to interfere too much in the relationship.</p>
      <p>"She has a beautiful relationship with him but I don’t want to step on her relationship too much," she said then. "They have a nice relationship."</p>
