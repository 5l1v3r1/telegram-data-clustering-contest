      <p>Mumbai: As a fierce political storm in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> uproots alliances and destroys familial relations, a leading audit firm, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Grant-Thornton">Grant Thornton</a> India, has ‘politely’ turned down the request of a probe agency to investigate a case which has 77 state politicians labelled as ‘accused’.</p>
      <p>Both <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Mumbai-Police">Mumbai Police</a> and the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Enforcement-Directorate">Enforcement Directorate</a> (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ED">ED</a>) are investigating the actions of more than 70 politicians— 50 from the Nationalist Congress Party (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NCP">NCP</a>), including its chief Sharad Pawar and his nephew Ajit Pawar, nine from the Congress, two from the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Sena">Shiv Sena</a> and one from the Bharatiya Janata Party (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/BJP">BJP</a>).</p>
      <p>The two agencies are probing allegations pertaining to loans sanctioned by MSC Bank. Also under the scanner are the sale of at least two cooperative sugar factories by the executive committee, in which Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar was a member, sources said. While Sharad Pawar has not been named as an accused in the FIR, the complainant in his statement has alleged he is the ‘mastermind’ in the case</p>
      <p>Nearly a month before the polls, in September the ED which registered a money laundering case named both the Pawars in its complaint following which Pawar even offered to appear before the agency but at the request of the Mumbai Police which cited a law and order situation didn’t visit the central agency office in South Mumbai. Political observes say the ED ‘probe’ played an important role in the elections helping Pawar-lead NCP to win 54 seats in the elections last month.</p>
      <p>“MSC bank accounts requires a thorough forensic audit to ascertain the allegations levelled by the complainant and therefore GT was request to conduct the audit, however they decline to do so citing the political nature of the case,” said a person in the know of the development. GT declined to comment to an email sent by ET Meanwhile the Mumbai Police and ED which had sought details from National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) and the statutory auditor are now studying the reports.</p>
