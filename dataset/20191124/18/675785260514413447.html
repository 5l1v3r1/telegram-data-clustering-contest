      <h1>Tories pay Google to drive postal vote applications to their website</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE The party was accused of trying to harvest data from people trying to apply for a postal ballot after paying Google to advertise on the words 'register to postal vote'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:29:55+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:29</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>The Conservative Party has been hoodwinking voters into visiting their website by paying <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a> to place links claiming above official advice on registering for a postal vote.</p>
      <p>The party was accused of trying to “harvest data” from people trying to register for a postal ballot.</p>
      <p>With just days to go before the deadline to register for a postal vote, users searching for “register to postal vote” on Saturday were shown the Tory website as the top result.</p>
      <p>And despite having a button on the page which reads “APPLY NOW”, voters cannot apply for a postal vote through the page.</p>
      <p>The site just allows them to print out a paper form for their application - and invites them to join the Tory mailing list.</p>
      <p>Applications for postal votes must be received by local authorities by 5pm on Tuesday to count in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> .</p>

      <p>Darren Hughes, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) said: "It's unfortunate that impartial resources on voting are often outgunned by campaigns trying to harvest data like this - from voter registration to postal voting.</p>
      <p>“A review of our outdated campaign rules could look at how to ensure voters always have priority access to the independent election advice needed"</p>
      <p>"At the moment it is silicon valley giants setting the rules on campaign ads. It's time to ensure full transparency."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> run a similar website encouraging people to register for postal votes- but have not paid to boost it to the top of search results above official pages from Gov.uk.</p>
      <p>Some 300,000 people registered to vote on Friday, after the ERS launched National Voter Registration Day.</p>

      <p>But the group warned millions of potential voters could still be missing from voter roles as Tuesday’s deadline for applications approaches.</p>
      <p>While other parties publicly backed the registration drive, the Conservative Party did not.</p>
      <p>The Tories sparked outrage during last week’s Labour manifesto launch by paying Google to hijack search results for the event.</p>
      <p>People searching for “Labour” were presented with a fake Tory attack website with the address labourmanifesto.co.uk.</p>
      <p>And they were warned not to mislead the public by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> after they rebranded an existing party account to mimic an independent fact checking service.</p>
