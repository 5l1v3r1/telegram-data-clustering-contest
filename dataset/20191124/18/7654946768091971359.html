      <h1>Man found guilty in fiancée’s murder after KFC receipt links him to slaying</h1>

      <p>An Oregon man was convicted of killing his Russian bride-to-be after a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/04/man-on-trial-for-fiancees-murder-after-kfc-receipt-links-him-to-killing/">KFC receipt linked him</a> to the crime scene, according to a report.</p>
      <p>William Chase Hargrove, 30, was found guilty Friday in the murder of Anna Repkina, a 27-year-old woman executed near Alsea in April 2017, <a href="https://www.gazettetimes.com/news/local/jury-finds-hargrove-guilty/article_5184ed7b-b3ac-5f04-a7e7-5351c5e9f2f1.html">the Corvallis Gazette-Times reported.</a></p>
      <p>Prosecutors allege Hargrove fatally shot Repkina on a remote logging road to appease his married lover — then withdrew $800 from her bank account.</p>
      <p>The prosecution claims he met Repkina online and convinced her to move from Moscow to Oregon — all while he involved in an “interesting love-triangle relationship” with another woman, Michelle Chavez, the outlet reported.</p>
      <p>His fiancée’s body was found with no clues about her identity other than a nearby KFC bag, which contained a receipt for a man named Kevin Thomas, the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>Thomas told authorities that he recently shared a meal with Hargrove, who borrowed his shotgun and not returned the weapon, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Hargrove was arrested three days later and denied any role in the slaying, officials said.</p>
      <p>His lawyer argued Chavez killed Repkina out of jealousy — but she has maintained that she wasn’t responsible.</p>
      <p>The 12-person jury found him guilty of murder, theft and identity theft after three hours of deliberation.</p>
      <p>Hargrove faces a minimum of 25 years in prison on the murder charge.</p>
