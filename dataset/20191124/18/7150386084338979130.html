Canterbury have played 2 games so far in the tournament, out of which they have won one and other got abandoned. Otago, on the other hand, have also played the same number of matches – winning one and losing one in the competition. Now both teams will want nothing less than a victory here as Canterbury will look to build on their early form, Otago, at the same time, would look to bounce back from their loss in the last game against Wellington.</p>
