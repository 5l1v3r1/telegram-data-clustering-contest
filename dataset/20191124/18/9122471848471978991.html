      <h1>Photos: The Crowd For The Redskins-Lions Game Is Embarrassing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:38:49+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The Washington Redskins are hosting the Detroit Lions in a game at FedEx Field in Landover, Md. this afternoon. There appear to be <i>some </i>fans in attendance.</p>
      <p>Washington has struggled with attendance problems for much of the 2019 regular season and that is no different today.</p>
      <p>Detroit has a decent number of fans inside the stadium, at least.</p>
      <p>The rest of the crowd is looking pretty sparse:</p>

      <p>At least there won’t be too much traffic getting home…</p>

      <p>Washington (1-9) is tied with Detroit (3-6-1) at 3-3 early in the second quarter. Maybe the fans in attendance will at least be able to see a close game.</p>
