      <p>WWE Untold has become quite an interesting series on the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> Network that allows WWE stars to tell the real stories behind some of the biggest moments that have happened in WWE history.</p>
      <p>Past episodes have included <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/the-undertaker">Undertaker's</a> WWE debut where he was able to tell the real story behind it and how he had no idea how Vince McMahon was going to book him when he made the move over to WWE to debut at Survivor Series back in 1990.</p>
      <p>Almost 24 years later, Sting made his debut at the same show in 2014 and what then followed was almost a year of The Singer in WWE until his final match against Seth Rollins at Night of Champions in 2015.</p>
      <p>As part of the most recent episode of the show Seth Rollins, Michael Hayes, Sting and John Cone were all able to tell the real story of what happened on that night in 2015 as well as the backstage stories leading up to Rollins' WWE Championship match against Sting.</p>

        <figcaption>Sting's debut in WWE was a huge surprise to everyone involved</figcaption>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/sting">Sting</a> was always seen as one of the best wrestlers to have never stepped foot in a WWE ring, but all of that came to an end back in 2014 when Sting made his debut at Survivor Series and helped Team John Cena to overcome The Authority by taking out Seth Rollins and pulling Dolph Ziggler on top of him to force The Authority out of power.</p>
      <p>It was the biggest shock of the year, given that this year also contained the end of Undertaker's streak, and it was a secret debut that lit up the WWE Universe in attendance that night.</p>
      <p>Sting's debut was kept so secret that the only people in the company that knew about his interference were the people in the ring at the time. This includes Dolph Ziggler, Seth Rollins, Triple H, the referee and obviously Mark Carrano and Vince McMahon.</p>
