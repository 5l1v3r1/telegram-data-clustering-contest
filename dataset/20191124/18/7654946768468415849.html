      <p>No one is calling Colin Kaepernick.</p>
      <p>One week has gone by since the 32-year old quarterback held a highly publicized workout in front of seven NFL teams at a high school in Riverdale, Georgia. Despite all the buzz it generated, not a single team has reached out to Kaepernick since, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28149508/sources-nfl-teams-called-colin-kaepernick-qb-nov-16-workout">according to ESPN</a>.</p>
      <p>This report runs contrary to a claim his attorney, Mark Geragos, made on The Adam Carolla podcast earlier this week during which he stated that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/2-nfl-teams-interested-in-colin-kaepernick-attorney-claims/">two teams had shown interest</a> in the quarterback.</p>
      <p>The workout was originally slated to take place at the Atlanta Falcons’ practice facility, but was switched to Charles R. Drew High School <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/colin-kaepernicks-nfl-workout-last-minute-change-causes-chaos/">at the last minute</a> after both sides were unable to agree on terms of a liability waiver. Twenty-five teams were set to attend Kaepernick’s originally scheduled workout, but after the location change, only seven teams — the New York Jets, San Francisco 49ers, Philadelphia Eagles, Kansas City Chiefs, Washington Redskins, Detroit Lions and Tennessee Titans — attended the workout, which was about an hour from the Falcons’ facility. A tape of the workout was sent to the other 25 NFL teams not in attendance. </p>
      <p>Kaepernick addressed the press and teams present that day.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been ready for three years, I’ve been denied for three years,” Kaepernick said. “We all know why I came out here. [I] showed it today in front of everybody. We have nothing to hide. So we’re waiting for the 32 owners, 32 teams, Roger Goodell, all of them to stop running. Stop running from the truth. Stop running from the people.”</p>

      <p>Kaepernick has not played since 2016 after regularly kneeling during the national anthem in protest of police brutality and other social injustices. He <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/15/colin-kaepernick-and-nfl-settle-collusion-case/">reached a settlement with the NFL regarding his collusion case</a> on Feb. 15 that included a confidentiality agreement.</p>
      <p>While Geragos did not offer any names on the podcast, he referenced a team that “is legitimately in need of a quarterback who had a very poor showing on Sunday and has got an owner that I don’t think gives a s–t.”</p>
      <p>It’s unclear if he could be referring to the Carolina Panthers in light of quarterback Kyle Allen’s four-interception outing in last Sunday’s loss to the Falcons. <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/11/eric-reid-new-panthers-contract-more-proof-of-nfl-owners-conspiracy/">The Panthers inked safety Eric Reid</a>, who also filed a grievance against the NFL after participating in the national anthem kneeling protests, to a three-year, $22 million contract in February.</p>
      <p>In six seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, Kaepernick played in 69 regular-season games, passing for 12,271 yards, 72 touchdowns and 30 interceptions. He helped the Niners reach Super Bowl XLVII.</p>
