        <i>Any cat slave would know that if a cat brings you anything, whether it‚Äôs a dead cockroach or a lizard, it means the cat sees you as an important hooman and you should definitely appreciate it.</i>
      </p>
      <p>But this woman from the United Kingdom is one lucky person because a cat brings her PINK FLOWERS, instead of dead insects or animals. However, she didn‚Äôt know it was a cat doing it because she always thought it was the wind that blew the flowers to her doorstep.</p>

      <p>Although this adorable incident occurred in 2018, it is currently making rounds on social media again. Rosie (the human) had been noticing these flowers since early Spring last year until <b>one of her housemates told her that she saw Willow (the neighbourhood cat) with a pink flower in her mouth.</b></p>
      <p>Rosie couldn‚Äôt hold her excitement to film Willow when she saw the cat coming over to her house as she was cooking.</p>
      <blockquote>‚ÄúI was so excited that I went to film it because she‚Äôs so cute and I‚Äôd never seen a cat ever bring back anything but dead animals before.‚Äù</blockquote>
      <p>Here‚Äôs the sweet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKiTF_yvj0E&amp;feature=emb_title">video</a> of Willow (uploaded by Love Meow) being welcomed into Rosie‚Äôs garden:</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.lovemeow.com/cat-brings-flowers-to-neighbors-2565313067.html">Love Meow</a>, Willow is loved by the neighbours and nobody could resist feeding and spoiling her. Rosie and her housemates would even save up cardboard boxes for Willow to chill in when she paid them a visit every day. They‚Äôd also offer Willow yummy treats and cat food when their friendly four-legged friend arrives at their doorstep.</p>

      <p>Not only that, but Willow would also cuddle up onto their couch and blanket and claim them as her own. <i>Look how fluffly and comfortable she is at the neighbour‚Äôs!</i></p>
