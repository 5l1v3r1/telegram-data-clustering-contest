      <h4>Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja</h4>
      <p>Chairmen of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Yobe and Kogi states have dissociated themselves from the group that called on the party’s National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, to resign.</p>
      <p>In separate press statements, made available to journalists in Abuja on Sunday, the state party chairmen, said they were never part of the group of party chairmen and members of the National Executive Committee (NEC) that met  Friday, after the NEC meeting, to demand for Oshiomhole’s resignation.</p>
      <p>It would be recalled that a section of the party’s NEC had, at a press briefing in Abuja, called on Comrade Oshiomhole to quit the office of the party’s National Chairman, accusing him of activities that had robbed the party of its goodwill.</p>

      <p>However, on Sunday, in separate statements, Adamu Achilare, the chairman of APC in Yobe, and his counterpart from Kogi, Abdulahi Bello, denied being part of the group that met on Friday after the NEC meeting to call on Oshiomhole to resign.</p>
      <p>In his statement, the Yobe State Chairman of the party, who wondered why the group would include his name and forge his signature, noted that he was solidly behind the position of APC North East state chairmen in support of the party’s National Chairman, adding that he has nothing against Oshiomhole that would lead to his joining the call for him to resign.</p>
      <p>“I must align myself with the position of North East APC chairmen. I did not attend any meeting with the other group and do not know why they decided to forge my signature. I have no reasons to demand for the resignation of our party Chairman because he has led the party vey well with results so far” Achilare noted.</p>
      <p>In the same manner, the Kogi State chairman of the party, Abdulahi Bello, who also distanced himself from the opposing group’s meeting and its resolutions said, “I, Abdulahi Bello, Chairman, APC in Kogi state, whole heartedly disassociate myself from the list purportedly out for the removal of His Exellency, Adams Oshiomhole, as the National Chairman of our great party, APC. I will not also hesitate to take any legal action against the masterminds of the purported list” he said.</p>
      <p>It should, however, be noted that the Chairman of the Forum of APC State Chairmen, Alhaji Ali Bukar Dalori, had earlier issued a statement, insisting that the forum never met to demand for Oshiomhole’s resignation.</p>
