        <b>Kate Beckinsale ‘stans’ her daughter’s new relationship like the cool mum that she is.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Her daughter, Lily Sheen, uploaded a cute snap of her and her beau David Schechter onto Instagram and Kate couldn’t help but leave her seal of approval.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old commented: ‘I stan this so hard you pair of a**holes’ underneath the post that Lily captioned: ‘Me and my boyfriend David on Saturday night.’</p>
      <p>The snap saw 20-year-old Lily and her beau cosy up for a chilled night in together and all we can imagine is Kate in the background cheering.</p>
      <p>Lily is Kate’s only child that she shares with former partner Michael Sheen.</p>
      <p>The two did not marry and Kate never knew why the Good Omens actor never proposed.</p>
      <p>‘When I was doing the interviews for Pearl Harbor, everybody kept asking the same thing,’ she told Scottish Daily in 2001.</p>

      <p>‘And I was too embarrassed to admit I really didn’t know why Michael hasn’t got round to proposing to me yet. So I would make up stories like “when Lily’s old enough to be our flower girl, we’ll get married”.</p>

      <p>‘But the truth is that Michael hasn’t asked me to be his wife yet. I actually asked Michael outright, “Why aren’t we married yet?” I couldn’t believe it when he said, “Because every time I was going to ask you, you did something annoying”‘.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Kate was recently linked to comedian Pete Davidson while <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/18/michael-sheens-partner-anna-lundberg-long-together-baby-due-10410054/">Michael Sheen is expecting his first child with girlfriend Anna Lundberg</a>.</p>
      <p>Posting on Twitter, Sheen wrote: ‘Very happy to let everyone know that my partner Anna and I are expecting a little angel of our own. (Just to be clear – we’re having a baby!) #nottheantichrist’.</p>
      <p>It might seem surprising to refer to the antichrist in a joyful baby announcement, but he’s referring to a story arc from his show Good Omens.</p>
      <p>He might have been joking about a demon offspring, but Damien Sheen (Damien Lundberg-Sheen?) does have a lovely ring to it.</p>
