      <p>Central Government immediately responded to the complaint of a TDP MP in Lok Sabha and added Amaravati to the Survey of India Maps. The speed at which the issue is resolved came as a surprise for YSR Congress. Immediately after that, <a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/politics/chandrababu-naidu-insulting-himself-in-desperation/">Chandrababu Naidu </a>wrote a letter to Union Home Minister, Amit Shah thanking him for the prompt response.</p>
      <p>YSR Congress supporters are worried if TDP and BJP get together and trouble Jagan. However, a section of YSR Congress supporters says it is indeed good for the party if the alliance really happens. They feel BJP will add no value to TDP but the alliance will prove to be counter-productive.</p>
      <p>“Come election time, we will charge TDP of allying with BJP to create problems for Jagan and stall the implementation of pro-poor agenda. With the recession ahead, the government will struggle to meet the expectations of the people. Then such statements will resonate with a broad plurality of AP voters and TDP will lose again,” a YSR Congress supporter feels.</p>
      <p>If Jagan is sent behind the bars, it will only help YSR Congress further. The sympathy factor will also add up to us,” the supporter added. Politics is a strange game as people say One Plus One does not necessarily equal to Two here. The next couple of years are going to be very interesting in AP Politics.</p>
