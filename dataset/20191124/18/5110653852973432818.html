      <p>“Jimmy and I had an amazing dinner, and he treated me with so much respect, and class. Honestly, we’re friends,” Mia told <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2018/07/22/kiara-mia-jimmy-garoppolo-date-sex/">TMZ</a>.</p>
      <p>Garrapolo, who didn't seem to realize the media frenzy his date with Mia would create,called the outing a learning lesson.</p>
      <p>“Life is different now,” he told reporters. “My life, off the field — I’ve never really been big on being very public with things even on social media. I’m not on there a ton.</p>
      <p>"But my life’s looked at differently.I’m under a microscope. It’s like (49ers hcoach Kyle Shanahan) said, it is a good learning experience. Just have to take it in stride. It is what it is."</p>
