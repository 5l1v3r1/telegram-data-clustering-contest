      <p>After a poor opening campaign at Camp Nou, Malcom was allowed to join Zenit during the summer, only to quickly become unsettled in Russia due to racist abuse from the club's supporters.</p>
      <p>Despite being less than halfway through his first year at Zenit, the Brazilian has hinted that a second stint at the Catalan giants is a possibility.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old told <i>RMC Sport</i>: "I have received messages about returning to Barcelona.</p>
      <p>"Whenever I was given a chance to play (at Barcelona) I think I did well. For that reason, I believe the Barcelona fans still love me."</p>
      <p>Malcom has made just two appearances for the Russian outfit this season.</p>
