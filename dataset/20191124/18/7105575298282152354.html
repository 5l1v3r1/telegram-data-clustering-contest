        <li>During a visit to the <a href="https://gg.govt.nz/publications/official-reception-government-house-solomon-islands">Government House in Honiara, Guadalcanal Island</a> on Sunday, the royal took time out to chat with traditional dancers.</li>

      <p><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a25046457/prince-charles-birthday-royal-family-photo-2018/">Prince Charles</a> is currently traveling on back-to-back royal tours. He and <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g22144190/prince-charles-camilla-relationship-timeline-photos/">his wife, Camilla Parker-Bowles</a>, just finished up their third joint tour of New Zealand, their first visit to the country in four years. The heir to the British throne followed up his trip to New Zealand with a three-day solo tour of The Solomon Islands, which is currently ongoing.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the Prince of Wales conducted Investitures at Government House in Honiara, Guadalcanal Island, after which he took time to chat with traditional dancers. In some photos from the encounter, <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a29811910/did-royal-family-send-charles-bahamas-the-crown/">Charles even appears</a> to be busting an adorably awkward move of his own with the dancers. Twitter, predictably, took notice.</p>
      <p>"Prince Charles dances with a pan pipe band at a reception at the governor generals residence," a <a href="https://twitter.com/royalfocus1">royal photographer for Shutterstock</a> wrote on Twitter, along with the pics.</p>

      <p>Royal fans were quick to chime in with comments about <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a15389862/prince-harry-dancing-video-cardiff/">Charles' dancing skills</a>.</p>

      <p>Well done, as usual, Twitter. Although, I have to say, I'm a bit disappointed by the lack of ABBA-inspired "Dancing King" jokes.</p>
