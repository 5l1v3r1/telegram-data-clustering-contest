      <p>Iraqi officials say 13 anti-government protesters have been wounded by security forces amid ongoing clashes in central Baghdad. In the country's oil-rich south, demonstrators were seen burning tires, and have cut main roads.</p>
      <p>The security and medical officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.</p>
      <p>The clashes in Baghdad's historic Rasheed Street continued Sunday for a fourth day. So far, 16 people have died and over 100 have been wounded in the latest round of street battles.</p>
      <p>Security forces have been using tear gas, rubber bullets and even live ammunition to disperse protesters. At least 342 people have died since demonstrations began Oct. 1.</p>
      <p>U.S. Vice President Mike Pence encouraged the Iraqi government to show restraint with the protesters, speaking during an unannounced trip to Iraq on Saturday.</p>
