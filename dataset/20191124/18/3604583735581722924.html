      <h1>Economist Ross Garnaut returns to Ballarat for forum on renewable economy opportunities</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Ford</a></address>
      <p>Professor Ross Garnaut was in Ballarat in August, speaking at the Grampians New Energy Taskforce's Decarbonising Victoria event.</p>
      <p>Since then, he's released a book, <i>Superpower: Australia's Low-Carbon Opportunity</i>, and he said Ballarat is a superb example of how to make the most of this opportunity to harness renewable energy for cheaper electricity and more jobs.</p>
      <p>"I was impressed," he said.</p>
      <p>"I was very interested in the focus of the region in building on these assets to create a bigger economic future in the region.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"There's a lot of good thought being given to the possibilities, and that made me very interested in keeping in touch."</p>
      <p>He'll return on Wednesday for a public forum to discuss a low-carbon future, led globally by Australia.</p>
      <p>The book notes decarbonisation of electricity is a path to nearly complete decarbonisation of transport, and partial decarbonisation of industry, and that could be the foundation for Australia to become an economic "superpower" - hence the title of the book.</p>
      <p>The wind turbines being installed across the district, and solar panels on roofs, will be part of a bigger plan, he adds - once enough green electricity is being generated, other problems can be solved more easily.</p>
      <p>"I mention briefly in the book the very low cost of renewable energy transforms the economics of moving water, recycling water, and desalinating water," he said.</p>
      <p>"I'm interested in bringing that into the conversation about western Victoria."</p>
      <p>Also speaking at the event on Wednesday is City of Ballarat deputy mayor Belinda Coates.</p>

      </p>
      <p>She said when economists like Professor Garnaut say there is an "enormous opportunity", then "everyone should be pricking their ears up".</p>
      <p>"Having the foresight and vision to put in some investment now for a really big return - not only does it make comm more resilient, it creates jobs along the way and reduces impact on the environment," she said.</p>
      <p>"It really is win-win-win."</p>
      <p>Professor Garnaut had a simple message for people still not convinced.</p>
      <p>"There's already a lot of interest in Ballarat and western Victoria, there's opportunity, I'd like to confirm for them that it's real, it's big, and within the grasp of the region</p>
      <p>The Committee for Ballarat will host the public forum at the Ballarat Tech School on Wednesday from 5.30pm.</p>
      <p>Limited free tickets are <a href="https://www.trybooking.com/book/event?eid=576840&amp;">available online.</a></p>
