      <p>Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has reported that a consul contacted the shipowner and the police over the death of a Ukrainian sailor amid a storm in the Celtic Sea.</p>
      <p>Speaking in a comment for UNIAN, Deputy Director of the MFA's consular service department Vasyl Kyrylych confirmed the Ukrainian sailor's death aboard a bulk carrier in the Celtic Sea.</p>
      <p>"The consul immediately contacted the shipowner, the agent of the vessel, the crewing agency, and the police over this tragic incident. The consul is taking all the necessary measures in this situation," he said.</p>
      <p>A Ukrainian sailor reportedly died from an injury received during a storm in the Celtic Sea on November 22. The ship interrupted her voyage from the United Kingdom to Cuba because of the incident and was heading for Brest.</p>
