      <h1>‘We Will Ensure Stable Government And Work Hard For Public Welfare’: Ajit Pawar Breaks Silence, Thanks PM Modi</h1>

      <p>Breaking his silence after nearly 36 hours, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Sunday evening tweeted his thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and many top ministers and Bharatiya Janata Party leaders.</p>
      <p>"Thank You, Hon. Prime Minister @narendramodi ji. We will ensure a stable government that will work hard for the welfare of the people of Maharashtra," he tweeted.</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar also conveyed his gratitude to Union Home Minister and BJP President Amit Shah, BJP working president J.P. Nadda, Union ministers Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari, Nirmala Sitharaman, Smriti Irani, Piyush Goyal, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, D.V. Sadananda Gowda, and Dharmendra Pradhan for their best wishes on his taking over as the new Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister.</p>
      <p>This was Ajit Pawar's first communication after he took the oath of office along with Devendra Fadnavis as Chief Minister early on Saturday morning, sparking off a huge political crisis in the state.</p>
      <p>While the matter is now pending before the Supreme Court, the Nationalist Congress Party is making efforts to win him back to the party fold, though the latest tweets are a clear indicator of Ajit Pawar's mind.</p>
