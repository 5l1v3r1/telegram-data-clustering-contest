      <h1>Sheffield Utd 3-3 Man Utd player ratings: Phil Jones a "car crash" but Marcus Rashford shines</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United continued their upturn in form at Sheffield United as goals from Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood and Brandon Williams turned the game around</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:24:16+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:24</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United's problems were laid bare against Sheffield United - and even showing the spirit of yesteryear couldn't save them.</p>
      <p>Sheffield United were dominant at Bramall Lane, with John Fleck and Lys Mousset's strikes looking like they were going to seal the a memorable and famous three points.</p>
      <p>But United's young guns had other ideas in the latter stages. First, Brandon Williams hammered home his first professional goal.</p>
      <p>Minutes later, Mason Greenwood hopped off the bench to tap home a pinpoint Marcus Rashford cross and level the game.</p>
      <p>And Rashford got in on the act himself, completing the seven minute salvo, handing United what they thought would be all three points.</p>
      <p>That was until Oli McBurnie survived a stoppage time VAR check to ensure the spoils were shared.</p>
      <p>Here is how John Cross, our man at the ground, rated the performances...</p>

      <h3>Sheffield United</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Moore 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>The stand-in keeper was fairly solid but watched defence collapse around him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Basham 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>His half clearance set up a United goal. Spoiled an otherwise solid display.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jagielka 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rolled back the years in defence, looked composed and strong.</p>
      <p>
        <b>O’Connell 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Solid display in defence, did what little he had to do well. Efficient.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Baldock 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Such a neat and tidy display at high wing back, always looking for the ball.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lundstram 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Booked. Had a super shot well saved. Big <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> fan. Heartbreaking finish.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Norwood 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Went in hard on Jones, proper old school tackle - superb stuff. Battling.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fleck 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sheffield United’s best player. Scored, amazing assist, brilliant passing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stevens 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>The outlet down the left for the Blades. Played role in leveller.</p>
      <p>
        <b>McGoldrick 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Good powerful runs forward, caused United’s defence all manner of problems.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mousset 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lovely finish as he bullied United’s defence. Went off injured early.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>McBurnie, for Mousset, 68 mins, 6</p>
      <p>Sharp, for McGoldrick, 78 mins</p>
      <p>Robinson, for Basham, 83 mins</p>

      <h3>Manchester United</h3>
      <p>
        <b>De Gea 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Super saves, United would have gone in 4-0 down at half time if it hadn’t been for him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lindelof 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Steady in an overworked defence which was stretched to breaking point.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Maguire 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>His dream return to Bramall Lane nearly turned into a nightmare. He kept batting away.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jones 3</b>
      </p>
      <p>Car crash of a performance. Outfought and outwitted, embarrassing. Hooked at half time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wan-Bissaka 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Booked. Probably not what he expected at United - but came good in the end.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pereira 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>He is just not up to it, squad player or not. Was left chasing shadows in midfield.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Fred 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Should be nowhere near United’s midfield. £52m down the drain. Woeful.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Williams 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Booked. He is a big prospect, mark of his quality was his goal and not letting head drop.</p>
      <p>
        <b>James 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Quiet for long spells but played a big role in two goals as he came alive late on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Martial 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Managed United’s first shot on target after 29 minutes. Got better as game wore on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rashford 8 MOTM</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scored and led the United fightback with a performance full of determination.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Substitutes</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lingard, for Jones, 46 mins, 8</p>
      <p>Greenwood, for Pereira, 73 mins</p>
      <p>Tuanzebe, for Martial, 85 mins</p>
