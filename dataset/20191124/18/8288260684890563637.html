      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news | The goalkeeper was training with AVFC in October</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:24:08+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:24</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Jordan Archer was training with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> last month after his release from Millwall in the summer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/who-jordan-archer-aston-villa-17057751">The goalkeeper spent time at Bodymoor Heath</a> as part of his search for a new club following his four-year spell at the Den.</p>
      <p>Nothing materialised and Archer remains a free agent – for now at least.</p>
      <p>West Ham United are weighing up signing him to solve their goalkeeping crisis, according to reports.</p>

      <p>First-choice Lukasz Fabianski is injured and Roberto Jimenez, a summer signing from Espanyol, has struggled since coming into the side.</p>
      <p>The Hammers are considering their January options and could snap up Archer, according to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/24/hughton-and-benitez-in-west-ham-frame-as-pressure-grows-on-pellegrini">the Guardian.</a></p>
      <p>Archer spent time in Charlton Athletic's academy before joining Spurs in 2009.</p>
      <p>He graduated through the North London side's academy in 2011 but didn't make a single senior appearance for Spurs.</p>
