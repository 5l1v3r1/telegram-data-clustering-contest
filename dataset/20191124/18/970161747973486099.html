      <p>A child was forced to stab her pet dog after it started mauling the babysitter.</p>
      <p>Rachel Anderson, 39, was looking after her friend Adel Johnson’s two young children last <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boxing/">Boxing</a> Day at their home in Rednal, Birmingham, when Siberian husky Storm attacked.</p>
      <p>The large animal locked its jaws on her face, before pulling her to the floor and dragging her into the kitchen at around midnight.</p>
      <p>It savaged her arm for 45 minutes while she screamed in agony, fearing she’d never make it out alive.</p>
      <p>It was only when one of the children stabbed the hound with a knife she was able to get free and call police.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-two Ms Anderson, from Skegness, said: ‘I was screaming for the kids to help me. In the end it got to the point where I shouted “do you want me to die here?”</p>

      <p>‘I told them “you need to come in and stab this dog”.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘It was sinking its teeth in, pulling me around, releasing it a bit to get a full grip again, letting me go to bite again.’</p>

      <p>Ms Anderson, who initially tried to get a knife herself, also said the thought of her little boy had kept her going.</p>
      <p>Police eventually shot the dog dead after one of the children had put it in the backyard.</p>
      <p>Ms Anderson needed nearly a dozen operations at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham to repair her wounds, and surgeons initially feared they’d have to amputate her arm after she got a skin infection and grafts refused to take.</p>
      <p>They managed to save her limb in the end after sewing it inside her stomach for four weeks to get new skin to grow back.</p>
      <p>In total, she spent two months in hospital and had ten operations.</p>

      <p>Police have now dropped the case but Ms Anderson is currently off work because she can’t use her right hand properly and is still receiving treatment.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘There has to be some kind of recognition. If you have a guard dog, have a guard dog. This was supposed to be a pet.</p>

      <p>Ms Anderson said when she’d visited Ms Johnson’s home before, the dog would be shut in the garden, but this time Storm was in the kitchen.</p>
      <p>It launched its attack when she went to get one of the children a drink.</p>
