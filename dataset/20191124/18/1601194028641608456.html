      <p>2019 is done and dusted for the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/india-national-cricket-team">Indian Test team</a>. The <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/virat-kohli">Virat Kohli</a>-led side won their last Test match of the year against Bangladesh by an innings and 46 runs. The Indian team remained unbeaten throughout the year in which they played eight matches. The world-number-one side went on to win seven out of these matches with one ending in a stalemate. All these seven wins were consecutive, which is India's best winning streak. The Indian batsmen have been instrumental in the success of the team.</p>
      <p>It has been a collective team effort from the Indian batters as almost everyone has put their hand up when the opportunity has knocked on the door. Thus, the results have been positive and the batsmen have played their role in setting up the wins. India have always been known to be a batting-heavy side and the world-class Indian batsmen have delivered the goods.</p>

      <p>The Indian skipper Virat Kohli kept churning out the runs in 2019. Kohli scored 612 runs in the 11 innings he played in the calendar year. The talisman scored his runs at a staggering average of 68 and a strike rate of 63.28. The linchpin scored two half-centuries and as many centuries in 2019.</p>
      <p>Kohli's best knock came in the second Test match against South Africa as he scored a gargantuan knock of unbeaten 254 runs. This is Kohli's highest score in Tests.</p>
      <p>Kohli also scored a fine knock of 136 runs in the pink-ball Test match against Bangladesh. When most batsmen had issues against the pink ball, Kohli showed why he is the best in the business as he seemed in command. The Indian captain will aim to continue his good form going in 2020.</p>
