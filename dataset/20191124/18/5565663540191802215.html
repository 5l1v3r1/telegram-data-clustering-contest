      <p>Dear Editor <br/><br/>The Apostolic Product Certification Zimbabwe is encouraging all butchery owners, meat suppliers and distributors to follow all necessary steps in identifying health cattle for sale to human consumption. <br/><br/>We are disturbed by the rising deaths of cattle across provinces in Zimbabwe due to sickness and diseases. We have noticed some cattle owners who are rushing to sell their cattle to butchery owners and cattle meat dealers the moment they notice an outbreak in their kraals. Some butchery owners are taking advantage of desperate sellers and buy these unhealthy cattle with cheap prize. <br/><br/>We always believe in a healthy Zimbabwe and we care for the daily consumption of our people. We urge Apostolic sects members and citizens to avoid buying beef from dealers who are not following proper veterinary and healthy regulations. We ask Apostolic sects and citizens of Zimbabwe to avoid being victims of such scam. <br/><br/>We also advise butchering and commercial meat suppliers to put more effort in preserving meat by adequate refrigeration, we have noticed some of the consumers who have fell victim to buying rotten meat and chicken. We seriously advise members of the Apostolic communities and citizens to check the freshness of Beef, Fish, chicken and meat products before payment. Dealers, sellers and suppliers should not use any harmful method of preservation to meat especially toxic chemicals. <br/><br/>The health of our millions of Apostolic membership and citizens is our priority so we are sending a red alert on these issues. <br/><br/>We pray so that the relevant authorities will continue to monitor these incidents and arrest all those who do not abide with the supreme law of the land. <br/><br/>Sincerely <br/><br/>Obey Mapuranga <br/><br/>Chairman and Founder : Apostolic Product Certification Zimbabwe <br/>Email:info@apostoliccertification.co.zw <br/>Website:www.apostoliccertification.co.zw <br/><br/>Cross pollinate religion and food industry</p>
