      <p>Dwayne Johnson and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/danny-devito/">Danny DeVito</a> literally broke into a couple’s wedding reception in Mexico while busy promoting Jumanji: The Next Level – and we are totally not jealous.</p>
      <p>No, not at all.</p>
      <p>The actors were in the Mexican city of Cabo San Lucas to promote the release of the third installment in the Jumanji franchise, and what better way than to crash a wedding while at it?</p>
      <p>Dwayne and Danny could be both seen at the happy couple’s wedding reception, but the newlyweds did not appear to be annoyed in the slightest, and were happy to pose for photos with the two stars.</p>
      <p>After all, would you really be mad if a celebrity made a guest appearance at your wedding?</p>
      <p>As the two attended the upcoming film’s photocall, Dwayne also appeared alongside his fellow co-stars Jack Black, Kevin Hart and Karen Gillian.</p>
      <p>The highly anticipated follow up to 2017’s Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle sees Danny star as Eddie Gilpin, the grandfather of Spencer Gilpin (Alex Wolff), while Dwayne plays Dr. Smolder Bravestone, Eddie’s (and previously Spencer’s) avatar in the Jumanji game.</p>

      <p>Back in July, the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/01/jumanji-next-level-trailer-drops-dwayne-johnson-playing-danny-devito-10098695/">trailer for the movie officially dropped</a>, and it definitely looks to be a wild ride.</p>

      <p>Unbeknownst to his friends, Spencer had actually kept fragments of the smashed up Jumanji cartridge and worked to restore the system in the basement of his grandad’s (Danny DeVito) house.</p>
      <p>But unfortunately for him, Spencer ends up getting sucked into the game, leading Martha (Morgan Turner) and Fridge (Ser’Darius Blain) to enter the game to rescue him – and while Martha gets to keep her previous avatar, Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillian), Fridge is a little bit annoyed to find he is now Professor Sheldon ‘Shelly’ Oberon (Jack Black).</p>

      <p>Eddie and his friend Milo (Danny Glover) also join the team, are landed the avatars Smouler Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) and Franklin ‘Mouse’ Finbar (Kevin Hart).</p>
      <p>The group all set off to rescue Spencer and escape Jumanji once and for all – while Eddie and Milo get used to their in-game avatars.</p>
