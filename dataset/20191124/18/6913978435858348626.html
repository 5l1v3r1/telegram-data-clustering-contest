The celebration kicked off with the 'Taste of Liguria', Cooking Masterclass at Novotel Tahlia from two Italian chefs coming from Italy especially for this occasion<br/><br/>The chefs explained the beauty of making Foccacia De Recco delightfully good focaccia at home lies in the fact that it makes use of basic Italian pantry staples – flour, water, salt, and extra virgin olive oil. Stretching the dough to the required paper-thin transparency, however, does take some practice. Rest assured though, it does get easier!<br/><br/>After this, the secret from the Italian kitchen regarding the traditional Pesto, a sauce that blends the flavors of Italian Summers was introduced to the audience.<br/><br/>Novotel Tahlia hosted the 'Taste of Liguria' with special guests from the consulates, influencers, diplomats, media and young food lovers in town. — SG</p>
