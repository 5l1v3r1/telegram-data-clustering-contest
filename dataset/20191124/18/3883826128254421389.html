        <b>Clare Shine's stunning late goal settled a thrilling Scottish Women's Cup final as Glasgow City beat Hibernian 4-3 at Tynecastle.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Champions City clinched the trophy for the ninth time in their history, and for the first occasion since 2015.</p>
      <p>The lead changed three times as the action raged from end-to-end.</p>
      <p>Shine headed City level and, as extra-time loomed, she struck again with a late run into the box before finishing high into the net.</p>
      <p>The win ended Hibs' three-year hold on the cup, with the Edinburgh side having won the previous seven domestic knockout competitions.</p>
      <p>And the match also broke the attendance record for a domestic women's match in Scotland, with 3,123 at Tynecastle.</p>
      <h3>Resilience</h3>
      <p>This was always going to be a tight game that was too tough to call. City went into this as favourites, having lost just once in 21 league games while having also made the Champions League quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>However, Hibernian have a certain knack of messing up the equation when it comes to cup fixtures.</p>
      <p>It is just over 12 years since Hibernian beat City in a league match. But Grant Scott's side have run riot when it comes to domestic cup competitions - and certainly, the opening period of the game would attest to there being very little between the two teams.</p>
      <p>Amy Gallacher opened the scoring on the 31st minute from a Colette Cavanagh cross - firing the ball from the left hand side of the box past Lee Alexander. It was the start of things to come as both teams served up a cracker.</p>
      <p>Eilish McSorley levelled with a close-range effort right through the middle of the box, and over the top of Hibs keeper Jenna Fife. And the champions had the lead at half-time when Leanne Crichton smashed in a volley.</p>
      <p>It was 2-2 when Jamie-Lee Napier, who had already scored 15 league goals this season, drove in a low shot and minutes later it was 3-2 when City captain Leanne Ross turned a Gallacher shot towards her own goal.</p>
      <p>In the end, it was City's resilience that won the day. Shine headed City level, then in the 90th minute made a lovely run down the wing into the box, through the defence in the box, and smacked the ball into the top corner.</p>
      <h3>Player of the match - Clare Shine</h3>
      <p>She sealed the winner for Glasgow City with a lovely piece of individual skill, and left Tynecastle with two goals. Shine was there throughout the game, harassing and troubling the Hibernian defence - a persistent niggle to City's opponents.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old from Cork was fundamental up front. And, when not attempting to score herself, was always there to provide for her team-mates.</p>
      <p>A huge part of the team since she arrived back at City, the Republic of Ireland international has been a massive part of their success.</p>
      <h3>'Great game' - post-match reaction</h3>
      <p><b>Glasgow City head coach Scott Booth:</b> "It is 100% the best season. To still be in the Champions League quarter-finals, to have won the league, the Scottish cup and get to the final of the league cup is very, very hard to beat.</p>
      <p>"It's one of the best ever achievements for me personally.</p>
      <p>"We didn't start well - it took about 20 minutes to wake up. I felt like we could take it and the one player I was hoping would get the opportunity was Clare Shine."</p>
      <p><b>Hibernian head coach Grant Scott:</b> "It was an exciting game for spectators, overall a great game. We are just very disappointed to lose.</p>
      <p>"I thought we lost some bad goals today - I felt that with that last goal we should've been more clever before it got the stage of them being able to get it. The ease she managed to get by some of our defenders. But as much as we set out to attack and take the game to our opponent, I feel we should have done a bit better than we did.</p>
      <p>"Overall the disappointment is with the result. Performance wise we had some really good spells. It's a loss, a sore one to take, it will take days and weeks to get over for most of us, but just one of those things."</p>
