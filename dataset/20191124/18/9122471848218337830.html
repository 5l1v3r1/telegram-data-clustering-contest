      <h1>Browns Fans Getting Criticized For Pregame Mason Rudolph Stunt</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:01:46+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Browns fans have been understandably upset over the Mason Rudolph vs. Myles Garrett helmet swing incident and the fallout that left them without their star pass rusher. So it should come as little surprise that the Steelers quarterback – who got slapped with a fine despite being accused of instigating it in the first place – is the subject of pregame stunts by the fans.</p>
      <p>Footage from a tailgate shows a group of fans playing a game of piñata. But the target has the face of Mason Rudolph, and the item being swung at the target is a Steelers helmet.</p>
      <p>The Browns fans certainly seemed to be having fun at least.</p>
      <p>Here’s the footage, from cleveland.com:</p>

      <p>But the reaction to the piñata game has been very mixed, with some accusing them of being tacky or classless, and others downright cringing.</p>

      <p>The highly-publicized incident <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/nfl-releases-full-list-of-fines-suspensions-for-browns-steelers">resulted in an indefinite suspension</a> for Browns pass rusher Myles Garrett. That same suspension was upheld this past week.</p>
      <p>But Rudolph has been accused of many things, ranging from kicking Garrett in the groin before the helmet swing to calling Garrett racial slurs under the pile.</p>
      <p>We’ll likely never know the truth of what actually happened between Rudolph and Garrett, though.</p>
      <p>One thing is for sure: The Browns-Steelers rematch in Pittsburgh will be must-see TV.</p>
