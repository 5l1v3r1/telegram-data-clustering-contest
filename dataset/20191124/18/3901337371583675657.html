      <p>Chiefs' wait for a trophy continues after losing 2-1 to the Team Of Choice in the semi-finals on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Middendorp felt some of his players were already thinking about facing Mamelodi Sundowns in the final next month.</p>
      <p>"Always world wide something when you're going to the game, you're just not really... bring your concentration to the point where it should be. You're already in this game playing Sundowns on the 14th [December]," Middendorp told SuperSport.</p>
      <p>"We spoke about it several times, I said, "Please don't underestimate. Please make sure that we're first taking this game before we think about the next one".</p>
      <p>"That's a normal way, it's nothing unusual, it happens world wide. I was thinking we would be able to handle it but opposite we failed here," he added.</p>
      <p>Chiefs will now turn their attention to Wednesday's Absa Premiership clash with Stellenbosch in Cape Town.</p>
