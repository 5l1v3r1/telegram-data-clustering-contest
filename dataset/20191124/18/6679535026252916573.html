      <p>Two friends died while another sustained burn injuries after the bike they were riding on skidded on<b> </b>a hazardous chemical spill in Kashmere Gate, the police said on Sunday. As the chemical was corrosive in nature, the victims developed burns.</p>
      <p>The police personnel, who came in contact with the chemical while shifting the injured also suffered burn injuries, said the police.</p>
      <p>The deceased were identified as Mahesh, 23, a resident of Karawal Nagar; and Shivan, 21, of Rohini. Another victim Monu is undergoing treatment at Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital. The three were triple riding and were returning after attending a wedding in Nangloi when the accident took place, said the police.</p>
      <p>A PCR call was received at 5.45 a.m. on Saturday regarding a road accident on Mori Gate Road near Dufferin bridge. A police team rushed to the spot and the injured were taken to the hospital.</p>
      <p>But two of them succumbed to injuries on Sunday morning.</p>
      <h3>‘Spilled from truck’</h3>
      <p>“A policeman who was on night duty in the area said it was likely that the bike skidded due to a chemical spill on the road. The chemical would have spilled from a truck passing through the area,” said a police officer.</p>
      <p>Others who came in contact with the chemical also suffered minor burn injuries, he said.</p>
      <p>The officer added that the chemical was immediately cleared from the road. A sample of the chemical has been sent to the forensic laboratory to identify its nature, he added</p>
