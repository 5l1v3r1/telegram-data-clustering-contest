      <p><b>ISLAMABAD:</b> Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Secretary General Ahsan Iqbal has warned Planning Minister Asad Umar to avoid giving factually inaccurate statements regarding China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as the PTI regime’s mishandling of the project has already created severe problems for the landmark initiative.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Ahsan said had Prime Minister Imran Khan and his cabinet not turned CPEC into a controversial project with their uninformed and misplaced criticism it would not have fueled the barrage of international misunderstandings that benefitted those looking to demonise the project.</p>
      <p>Ahsan said that the total volume of Chinese loans under the CPEC is not $18 billion but actually $5.8 billion. “The duration of this loan’s return is between 20 to 25 years and its average interest rate is a mere 2 per cent, and all energy projects under the CPEC are investments, not loans,” he said, adding that this is a special concession by China for its brotherly country Pakistan.</p>
