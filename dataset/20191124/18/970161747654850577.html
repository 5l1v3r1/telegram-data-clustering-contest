      <p>Viki Gabor has won this year’s Junior <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/eurovision-song-contest/">Eurovision Song Contest</a> and when you hear her sing, you won’t be surprised, to be fair.</p>
      <p>The 12-year-old, who was born in Germany and has lived in England, represented Poland (where she currently lives) in the competition.</p>
      <p>Junior Eurovision’s final took place this afternoon in the Polish city of Gliwice.</p>
      <p>The runner up in the 17th edition of the contest was Yerzhan Maksim from Kazakhstan, who is also just 12 years old.</p>
      <p>Rising star Viki won with her powerful dance anthem Superhero, switching between English and Polish on the track. She and her colourful dancers looked overcome with emotion as the celebrated the result.</p>
      <p>Although, this being Eurovision, the presenter Ida Nowakowska’s reaction was even more… demonstrative.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, Viki’s vocal range is undeniably impressive and her silver on lime green coat is pretty cool, too…</p>
      <p>She beat out 18 competitors to take home the crown, and received 278 points, to Yerzhan’s 227 points. A total of 3.77 million votes were cast overall.</p>

      <p>The final score is split between audience votes and a professional jury, much like the main contest, which this year took place in Tel Aviv and was won by the Netherlands’ Duncan Lawrence.</p>

      <p>The UK hasn’t taken part in the competition, which features participants aged between nine and 14, since 2005.</p>
      <p>Viki also competed on The Voice Kids in Poland earlier this year, where she made it through to the final. Her debut single, Time, has been viewed almost <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyqCjljoZ24">three million times</a> since it dropped back in February.</p>
      <p>She also spent part of her childhood growing up in the English county of Essex, and has called Southend-on-Sea one of her favourite places in England, according to a <a href="https://www.gateway978.com/news/local/southend/southend-sights-victory-at-junior-eurovision-2019">local radio station in Basildon</a>.</p>
