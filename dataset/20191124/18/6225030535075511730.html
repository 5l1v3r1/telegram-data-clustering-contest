      <p>Terra Racing Stable’s 3-year-old filly <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Amalfi_Coast_1">Amalfi Coast</a> </b>continued her stakes streak at Woodbine on Sunday while earning graded status in the $175,000 <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/stakes/Bessarabian">Bessarabian Stakes</a></b> (G2), contested over seven furlongs on the main track.</p>
      <p>Eurico Rosa Da Silva worked out the ground-saving trip aboard the Kevin Attard-trained Tapizar filly, racing mid-field along the rail before angling outside three-wide on the turn and sweeping past the front-running Gamble’s Candy in the stretch. Amalfi Coast earned her third straight stakes victory, winning by 2-1/2 lengths in 1:22.03.</p>
      <p>Gamble’s Candy had led the field of a dozen distaffers through panels of :23.18 and :45.99 with 2-1 favourite Special Relativity and 97-1 longshot Zestina closest in pursuit. As Amalfi Coast rallied onto the scene, Painting chased her home to take second in a place photo over Special Relativity while Zestina finished fourth just ahead of Gamble’s Candy.</p>

      <p>“The trip was great,” said Da Silva afterwards. “In the paddock, Kevin had so much confidence. I think she sensed that confidence because, I’ll tell you what, she ran with a lot of confidence. And when we turned home, this filly took off. Galloping out, another horse was passing her, and she just wanted to take off again. She ran a brilliant race today.”</p>
      <p>Riding a two-race win streak in turf stakes action restricted to Ontario-bred three-year-olds, confidence was key for the Ontario Damsel and Carotene champion as she returned to the same distance and course on which she broke her maiden in early August.</p>
      <p>“She’s just a nice filly. She’s trained really well,” said Attard, who is amid a career-best season. “Obviously, the cut back to seven-eighths was a little bit of a challenge for her, but when a horse has some confidence, they can do anything.”</p>
      <p>Unraced as a two-year-old, Amalfi Coast improved her record to 4-2-1 from eight starts.</p>
      <p>“We always had high hopes for her,” said Attard. “She trained well as a two-year-old, she was really close to running and just needed a little time off so we started her up early in 2019. When she started working, she showed the talent that she was showing last year as a juvenile. Her first race was stellar. It looked like it was just a matter of time before she was going to break her maiden. It took a few more starts and the addition of blinkers seemed to really pick her up.”</p>
      <p>Da Silva, who also won Saturday’s Grade 2 Kennedy Road with the Robert Tiller-trained Pink Lloyd, has teamed up with Tiller (7) and Attard (5) to be the leading jockey-trainer combinations in stakes action at the Woodbine meet.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been spoiled with good horses, just blessed, and have the trust of these great trainers,” said Da Silva, with his retirement just three weeks away. “I have a lot of support. I have my wife, who supports me every day, I have a great family behind me, great friends. I’m just a lucky man.”</p>
      <p>Sent off as the 6-1 fourth choice, Amalfi Coast paid $14, $7.10 and $4.60. She combined with Painting ($10.60, $6.50), Special Relativity ($3.20) and Zestina for the exotic wagers, returning $100.20 for the $2 exacta, $269.45 for the $1 trifecta and $6,048.50 for the $1 superfecta.</p>
