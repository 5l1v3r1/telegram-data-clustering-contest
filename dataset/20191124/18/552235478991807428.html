      <h1>Dave Cormack takes control at Aberdeen as club announce Atlanta United partnership</h1>
      <h2>Milne has ploughed millions into the club and will step down as chairman after over two decades service.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:44:56+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:44</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Aberdeen have announced <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dave-cormack">Dave Cormack</a> is to become the club's new chairman while also revealing a partnership with MLS side Atlanta United who are investing £2million.</p>
      <p>The American-based tycoon was expected to take the reins at Pittodrie and the club confirmed the appointment on Sunday evening with fresh investment incoming after succeeding Stewart Milne who steps down after 21 years at the helm.</p>
      <p>The shake-up is part of a wide-ranging boardroom reshuffle which comes after Aberdeen unveiled their new training centre, named after Cormack following significant investment, earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The new chief landed in the Granite City ahead of the announcement with the US side confirming their financial involvement through parent company AMB Sports and Entertainment company.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stewart-milne">Milne</a> has ploughed millions into the club and has helped turn them into one of Scotland’s top clubs once again under <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/derek-mcinnes">Derek McInnes'</a> stewardship.</p>
      <p>But he has decided that over two decades service he will now look to recede into the background. Directors Ian Jack, Duncan Skinner and former manager Craig Brown will be stepping down from their boardroom roles.</p>

      <p>Cormack insists the tie-in with the MLS side is start of a bright new future with the club set to move to Kingsford in the coming years.</p>
      <p>He told Aberden's official website: “As an Aberdonian and lifelong Dons fan, I’m honoured and privileged to become chairman of the famous Aberdeen. I’m also pleased to be able to announce a strategic partnership with Atlanta United, details of which will be announced tomorrow, and further investment from myself, Tom and Roger.</p>
      <p>“Today, however, I’d like to focus on paying tribute to Stewart. During more than 20 years in the driving seat, he has had to deal with some turbulent times, both at the Club and within Scottish football. Thanks to his astute commercial acumen, his financial contributions and an unwavering loyalty, both as a chairman and a fan, he has successfully led the club through those times, having to make difficult decisions along the way. Not all of these have been popular among fans, but they have helped to get the club into a good position on and off the pitch. I am very pleased that he has agreed to stay on the Board in a non-executive capacity to ensure a smooth transition.</p>

      <p>“There are some real challenges ahead but, with the support of my fellow directors and new investors, along with our fans, we will do our utmost to deliver success which, at the end of the day, is measured by the team’s performance. The new investment and this partnership with Atlanta will allow us to punch above our weight, aspiring to attain UEFA’s top 100 status, and trying to level the playing field against significantly higher income generated by Celtic and Rangers.”</p>
      <p>Milne believes the future is bright with Cormack at the helm as he gets set to step back.</p>
      <p>He said: "He said: “For four years, we’ve been working on a succession plan. It’s been no easy task to find the right person who is willing to take on the onerous role of chairman, with responsibility for both the financial health and growth of the club.</p>
      <p>“In bringing Dave onto the Board and then appointing him vice-chairman, we viewed him as the natural successor. He qualifies on both counts. He is prepared to take on the commitment and has already proved his ability to secure significant new investment. Importantly, he is passionate about Aberdeen and the club.</p>

      <p>“I have always said I would relinquish the reins when the right opportunity arose and I believe that time has now come. I’m proud to have had the opportunity to lead the club I love for over two decades. It’s been a real privilege but not without its challenges! Like the fans, I’ve shared in a rollercoaster of emotions from pure joy and exhilaration through to frustration and despair.</p>
      <p>“We have been in a consistently healthier position for several years now and I’m pleased to be able to hand the club over to safe hands in the knowledge that we are debt-free and have more than doubled revenues from around £7.8million in 2013 to almost £16million today.</p>
      <p>“The opening of the £12million Cormack Park represents the completion of phase one of our vision for a new home. We’ve achieved this while still increasing the first team budget to its highest level yet and continuing to invest in our youth programme. Our annual spend on the overall football operation now amounts to £9million.”</p>
