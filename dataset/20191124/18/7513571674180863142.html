        <b>The Nigerian chapter of the Junior Chamber International has won the “JCI 100% Efficiency Award” for a second time.</b>
      </p>
      <p>JCI won the award at the 2019 JCI World Congress held in Tallinn, Estonia.</p>
      <p>Adeola Juyitan, national president, Junior Chamber International (JCI) Nigeria, said the award was in recognition of the team’s fulfilment of the overall management quality standards stated in the JCI National Organization 100% Efficiency Programme.</p>
      <p>“This award means a lot to us as a team and it demonstrates that our relentless efforts at contributing positive, indelible marks in the society are being recognized,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Winning this award for the second time in a row requires the fervent commitment to the ideology that it takes members of the JCI Nigeria ensuring that their unit, responsibilities and minibus is a pocket of greatness for the whole bus to also display beams of excellence.”</p>
      <p>Juyitan also joined all members across the globe, particularly in Africa, to congratulate the newly elected Itai Arthur Manyere from JCI Zimbabwe who emerged the 2020 world president in a keenly contested election.</p>
      <p>“Manyere is truly deserving of this victory as he is a perfect example of what the JCI movement represents – leadership and service,” the JCI Nigeria president said as she also wished Manyere outstanding and impact-filled tenure,” she said.</p>
      <p>Manyere was elected president amongst several other Africans and Nigerians who were also appointed into different offices of service.</p>
      <p>They include Olawale Bakare, Nigeria’s 2019 executive vice-president, who was appointed to serve as one of JCI Africa and Middle East Development Council (JCI-AMDEC) councilors for 2020; Rasheed Adeniyi Balogun, immediate past president and international vice president, appointed as a committee member on the JCI strategic plan implementation committee for 2020 and Oluwatoyin Atanda, executive assistant to the 2019 national president, appointed as a committee member on the JCI advocacy committee for 2020.</p>
