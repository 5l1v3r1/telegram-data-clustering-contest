      <h1>Work to repair Derby's 'worst road for potholes' is completed early</h1>
      <h2>Road will fully reopen from today</h2>

      <p>Work to repair potholes in one of Derby's busiest roads - which was once dubbed one of the worst in the country - looks to be over, days ahead of schedule.</p>
      <p>Motorists who regularly use Nottingham Road, which runs through Chaddesden, will be relieved to know that it will be open throughout the day from Monday.</p>
      <p>Work had been <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/derby-news/derbys-worst-road-potholes-undergo-3218518">scheduled to be finished by Friday</a>.</p>
      <p>For the past nine weeks, the road between the Pentagon Island and Wiltshire Road, has been closed during off-peak times between 9.30am and 3.30pm and 7pm until midnight, Monday to Friday.</p>
      <p>The project has seen the replacement of 10,100 sq m of road surface and road markings.</p>
      <p>Closing the road for the duration of the work was not an option due to the large volumes of traffic that rely on the route each day.</p>
      <p>A signed diversion route was in place and properties along the road were still able be accessed.</p>
      <p>But businesses along the road have complained that they have lost money because the roadworks were affecting footfall.</p>
      <p>Yasar Ozkaya, manager of Beaufort Fish Bar - which has a five-star hygiene rating - said he has been forced to close early and to let a member of staff go.</p>
      <p>Buses on the route have also been affected previously and have been missing the bus stops at Nottingham Road cemetery, Cornwall Road and Wayzgoose Drive, instead travelling along Chaddesden Park Road or Wiltshire Road to access Max Road and Hampshire Road as an alternative route.</p>
