      <p>The hall of fame wide receiver used a David &amp; Goliath reference as he preached a pep talk from the NFL Network studio.</p>

      <p>“I want my young Dallas Cowboys to know, those young Davids to know this giant that sits before you today, he is not for your destruction, it is for your construction,” Irvin said.</p>
      <p>“SLAY. THIS. GIANT.”</p>
      <p>The Cowboys and the Patriots are set to kick off at 4:25 p.m. E.T.</p>
