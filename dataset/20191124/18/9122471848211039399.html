      <h1>Kentucky Football Star Has A Message For Louisville Fans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:42:13+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The Kentucky-Louisville football rivalry may not have the same level of prestige as its basketball counterpart, but the players certainly see it as such.</p>
      <p>Case in point: Kentucky wide receiver Lynn Bowden Jr. had a message for Louisville fans heading into the big game.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media, Bowden compared the Kentucky-Louisville rivalry to the Browns-Steelers NFL rivalry – one with a lot of heat and mutual hatred.</p>
      <p>But the Steelers have historically dominated that rivalry, and the reporters took note of that.</p>
      <p>When asked which of the two teams he sees Kentucky as being, Bowden replied, “Yeah, we’re the Steelers.”</p>
      <p>He was then asked if he had a message for the Louisville fans:</p>
      <blockquote>Stay where y’all at. Don’t jump on our band(wagon)</blockquote>

      <p>Despite Bowden’s bravado, there’s rarely ever been a dominant team in the Governor’s Cup rivalry. In fact, Louisville has been the better team in recent years, winning six of the last eight.</p>
      <p>The Cardinals have not lost in Lexington since 2009. And the series is almost even with Kentucky leading 16-15 all-time.</p>
      <p>Kentucky is 6-5 on the season and are bowl eligible for the fourth year in a row. Louisville, meanwhile, is 7-4 – a five-game turnaround from last year.</p>
      <p>Will the Wildcats assert themselves as the state of Kentucky’s dominant team next weekend?</p>
