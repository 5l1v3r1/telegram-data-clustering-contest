      <h1>'Quite rough with small gangs': The Newcastle street some people are ashamed to live on</h1>
      <h2>Residents on Stanhope Street in Arthur's Hill have revealed what it is really like to live on the Newcastle street</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T18:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rachael Nichol</a></address>
      <p>Once an area where everyone knew their neighbours, residents on this Newcastle street say it has now lost its community spirit.</p>
      <p>Riddled by crime and with streets full of litter, Stanhope Street in Arthur's Hill is a shadow of its former self.</p>
      <p>Right in the heart of the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/arthurs-hill">community</a> lies Hutchinson's Fruit Shop, a family run business that has been open since the 1970s.</p>
      <p>One employee at the shop said he has lived on the street most of his life and has seen a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/two-men-charged-stanhope-street-15373897">big change in the area.</a></p>

      <p>The 32-year-old said: "It was amazing growing up as I knew people around here for years.</p>
      <p>"It has changed over the years and now it has become quite rough with small gangs."</p>
      <p>Jo Young, who also works at the shop, was born and grew up <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/west-end-newcastle-ear-biting-15632732">on the street</a> and is disappointed in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/west-end-newcastle-ear-biting-15632732">how things have changed</a>.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old said: "It’s a bit rough now, it's changed quite a lot.</p>
      <p>"There’s a lot of litter down the back lanes, I have to fight my way to get down them."</p>
      <p>Home to many traditional and multi-cultural businesses, one resident had happy memories going up on the street.</p>
      <p>Joan Ellis, 72, said she had seen huge changes in the area since she moved to the street 45 years ago.</p>
      <p>And she admitted that she was heartbroken at how the area had changed.</p>
      <p>She said: "I'm actually quite embarrassed about living here. Whenever someone asks where I live I'm ashamed to say.</p>
      <p>"When I first moved here it was a lovely place to live. It’s not the same as it used to be, now nobody knows their neighbours.</p>
      <p>"People always seem to miss bin day so they end up leaving bin bags out on the street and on the weekend there’s litter everywhere. It’s awful."</p>
      <p>However, Stanhope Halal Food Store owner Hamid Muhamad said he is proud of his street.</p>

      <p>And he insists that there is still a great sense of community spirit in the area.</p>
      <p>Moving to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">Newcastle</a> from Afghanistan, he used to be a taxi driver before opening his store which has been running for five years.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old said: "I love this area, it is very busy everyone's smiling and are really friendly."</p>
      <p>Taxi driver Ansar Quaraishi, who has lived in Arthur's Hill for 30 years, agreed.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old said: "It is still very traditional here but there are a lot more shops now and there is such a great environment.</p>
      <p>"I never want to live anywhere else."</p>
