      <h1>Mane, Salah &amp; Keita nominated for African Player of the Year award</h1>

      <p>Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Naby Keita have been put forward for the 2019 African Player of the Year award, with the Liverpool wingers surely the two favourites for the honour.</p>
      <p>The Red trio are up against Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Nicolas Pepe, Riyad Mahrez, Wilfried Zaha and Jordan Ayew – just to name a few.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You can see the full list of nominees in the Tweet below:</b>

      <blockquote>Your African Player of the Year Nominees 🌍🏅<br/>Who'll win the prestigious award? 🏆 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CAFAwards2019?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CAFAwards2019</a> <a href="https://t.co/vRhPh3IAz7">pic.twitter.com/vRhPh3IAz7<br/></a>— CAF (@CAF_Online) <a href="https://twitter.com/CAF_Online/status/1198554937619353601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>Should Salah win the award, it would be his third year on the bounce being named as Africa’s best player, but Mahrez is in with a shout.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to ignore his contribution to Algeria’s Africa Cup of Nations success, at the detriment of Mane’s Senegal, and the silverware he picked up with Manchester City last season.</p>
      <p>But, since we’re talking about a calendar year, I’d have to suggest Mane will win the award – he was brilliant for club and country over the last 12 months, and his start to the 2019/20 season has been second to none.</p>
      <p>That being said, there are a lot of deserved winners that have been nominated for the award, like Kalidou Koulibaly, Aubameyang and even Wilfred Ndidi.</p>
      <p>Whoever is crowned Africa’s best player will surely deserve it, but we hope it’s a Liverpool man!</p>
