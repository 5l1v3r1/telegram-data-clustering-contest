      <p>Black Friday is perhaps the single most important day of the year for US retailers, even as Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Last year, US retailers set a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/24/black-friday-pulled-in-a-record-6point22-billion-in-online-sales-adobe.html">record</a> with $6.22 billion in Black Friday business in online sales alone.</p>
      <p>With the online component, Black Friday continues to include more than just electronics and toys. Even airlines have been jumping on board with sales and specials of their own.</p>
      <p>So far, deals are rather sparse, but we expect more to be announced as Black Friday and Cyber Monday get closer.</p>
      <p>We’ll be updating this list as the world’s airlines announce their Black Friday sales, so be sure to check back and refresh.</p>
