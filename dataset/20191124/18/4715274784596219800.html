      <h1>LandBank bares credit plan to modernize agri</h1>

      <p>Land Bank of the Philippines, the fourth-largest lender in terms of assets, recently launched a new credit program to promote modern and sustainable farming in the country.</p>
      <p>Bank president and chief executive Cecilia Borromeo said the program—called “Financing Program for Greenhouse Farming System”—seeks to support the financial needs of farmers, cooperatives and agri-entrepreneurs planning to shift to modern farming by adopting greenhouse farming technology.</p>
      <p>Greenhouse technology allows farmers to grow off-season crops all year round in a climate-controlled environment. The technology also helps protect crops from extreme weather conditions, such as floods, droughts, super typhoons and rising temperatures brought about by global warming and climate change.</p>
      <p>“We hope to enhance the viability, sustainability and competitiveness of high value crop production of our farmers by adopting greenhouse farming technology,” Borromeo said in a statement over the weekend.</p>
