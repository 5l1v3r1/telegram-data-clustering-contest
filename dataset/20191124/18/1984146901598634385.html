      <p>We're funny, caring, love a laugh and we have great dress sense.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas </a>fast approaching, maybe you are thinking of popping the question.</p>
      <p>So, with this in mind, here are our reasons why you should definitely marry a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">Geordie</a>!</p>
      <p>And if you have any others then don't hesitate to leave them in the comments.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Let’s be honest, here in Newcastle, we really do serve up the best scran in the country - and we do like our bait.</p>
      <p>If you find a keeper get them to teach you the family recipes. It’s amazing what you can do with a stottie!</p>
      <h3>2. You’ll get the chance to try another language</h3>
      <p>And that’s ‘cos we have a language of our own.</p>
      <p>A canny gadgie will want to find a canny lass. And at the wedding ya get maartal drunk.</p>
      <h3>3. We have a wicked sense of humour</h3>

      <p>We just see the funny side of things. We’re just plain funny and enjoy a laugh.</p>
      <h3>4. You are always guaranteed a Sunday dinner</h3>
      <p>Because it just wouldn’t be Sunday without your mum’s Sunday dinner.</p>
      <h3>5. We enjoy tea</h3>
      <p>Which is really dinner, but we have dinner for lunch.</p>
      <h3>6. You’ll always have a roof over your head</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>With so much our city has to offer - nightlife, restaurants, cinemas and theatres - there is always somewhere to go.</p>
      <h3>8.... or date days</h3>
      <p>There’s so much to do in the daytime too.</p>
      <p>We have the most stunning coastline and a walk along our beautiful beaches is a perfect day.</p>
      <p>Or a day date at our gorgeous gardens (<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/alnwick">Alnwick Garden </a>and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/rothbury">Cragside at Rothbury</a>) is prefect.</p>

      <h3>10. We are generous</h3>
      <p>Yes, we really are.</p>

      <p>Imagine being thousands of miles away on holiday and hearing another Geordie accent.</p>
      <p>You’ve just got to stop and chat.</p>
      <h3>12. You’ll get the chance to live in the best city - with the best surroundings - in the world - Obviously</h3>
      <p>This goes without saying.</p>

      <h3>20. You will never, ever, be bored being married to a Geordie</h3>
      <p>Absolutely never. Ever.</p>
      <h3>21. Everyone in Newcastle seems to know each other</h3>

      <p>We use the words hinny or bonny and they are used as terms of endearment.</p>
      <h3>33. We can be very sarcastic</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article13865611.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/rkr_nec_100917-millican.jpg"/>

      <p>But funny - and we mean you no harm.</p>
      <h3>34. And that means you’ll spend your whole relationship taking the mickey out of each other - because who wants a boring relationship anyway?</h3>
      <p>Remember we said we are sarcastic? It applies towards our partners too.</p>
      <h3>35. We are straight talking</h3>
      <p>If we have something to say, then we’ll say it. End of.</p>
      <h3>36. We all have a story about Alan Shearer</h3>

      <p>‘Tis true.</p>
      <h3>37. And, you’ll learn, that despite all the stereotypes - we really are the best people</h3>
      <p>And that’s because we are friendly, chatty, funny, clever, smart, handsome, pretty.... need we go on?</p>
