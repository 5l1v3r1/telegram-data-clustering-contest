        <b>First, there are no so-called “detention camps” in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/xinjiang">Xinjiang</a>. Vocational education and training centres have been established for the prevention of terrorism.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Xinjiang is a beautiful, peaceful and prosperous region in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a>. Three years ago, this was not the case. It had become a battleground – thousands of terrorist incidents happened in Xinjiang between 1990s and 2016, and thousands of innocent people got killed. So there’s an enormous uproar among the Xinjiang people for the government to take resolute measures to tackle this issue. Since the measures have been taken, there’s no single terrorist incident in the past three years. Xinjiang again turns into a prosperous, beautiful and peaceful region. The preventative measures have nothing to do with the eradication of religious groups. Religious freedom is fully respected in Xinjiang.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Second, the trainees take various courses at the vocational education and training centres, and their personal freedom of the trainees is fully guaranteed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mandarin is widely used in China and thus taught as one of the courses at the centres. The trainees also learn professional skills and legal knowledge so that they can live on their own profession. That’s the major purpose of the centres. The trainees could go home regularly and ask for leave to take care of their children. If a couple are both trainees, their minor children are usually cared for by their relatives, and the local government helps take good care of the children. These measures have been successful – Xinjiang is much safer. Last year, the tourists increased 40%, and the local GDP increased more than 6%.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Third, there are no such documents or orders for the so-called “detention camps”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The so-called leaked documents are pure fabrication and fake news. There are many authoritative documents in China for the reference of Chinese and foreign media want to know more about the vocational education and training centres. For instance, seven relevant white papers have been published by the State Council Information Office.</p>
