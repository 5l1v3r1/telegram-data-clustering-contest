      <p>A group tagged Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Elders Forum has accused former President Goodluck Jonathan of trading off the party’s victory in the November 16 Bayelsa governorship election.</p>
      <p>According to Daily Sun, the group’s chairman, Chief Benson Odoko in a statement accused Jonathan of fraternizing with leaders of the All Progressives Congress in the state.</p>
      <p>Odoko claimed it was not debatable that ex-President Jonathan worked against the party that made him deputy governor, governor, vice president and president of the country.</p>
      <p>He pointed at Jonathan’s recent visit to President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa in Abuja as one of the indications that the former very president worked for the APC instead of his party.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Odoko further claimed that Jonathan distanced himself from the PDP in the buildup to the gubernatorial election.</p>
      <p>He further claimed that Jonathan and his wife, the former first lady, donated the Aridolf Hotel to the APC as the operational contact point for visiting dignitaries of the party and as the venue for the party’s primaries.</p>
      <p>Odoko also condemned the former president’s reception of the leader of the APC in the state, Chief Timipre Sylva, the candidate of the APC in the election, David Lyon, and others in his Otuoke home.</p>
      <p>He said all the listed actions proved that Jonathan betrayed the party that gave him the platform to occupy the highest positions in the country and Bayelsa state.</p>
      <p>Odoko said the PDP leadership should mete out disciplinary actions against Jonathan for his role in the PDP’s defeat in the state and for openly celebrating an opposition victory against the party which made him president.</p>
