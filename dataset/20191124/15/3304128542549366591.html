      <p>Former Kiambu governor William Kabogo has refuted reports that felled flying squad officer Daniel Etyang was a robber as alleged by the authorities.</p>
      <p>Etyang was killed alongside a taxi driver, in what police described as a thwarted robbery that involved the police officer.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, Kabogo said that the police officer worked as his aide for four years before he was deployed to work under Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) CEO Dr Jonah Manjari.</p>
      <p>“The late Etyang was my Assistant for 4 yrs, thereafter worked with the MD KEMSA. I can swear he was not a robber that’s BS, cold blooded murder. The killers should face the full force of the law,” wrote Kabogo.</p>

      <p>The police said that Etyang and the driver were planning to commit crime at Ruaka Court Yard, but did not specify the type of crime.</p>
      <p>Police said they recovered a government registered Jericho pistol which had 10 rounds of ammunition.</p>
      <p>However, other reports indicate that the officer’s gun was not fired, meaning there was no exchange of fire.</p>
