      <p>You don't have to be fully committed to Microsoft's vision of gaming to play <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/27/state-of-decay-2-update-apocalypse/"><i>State of Decay 2</i></a>. The zombie-filled survival game is now <a href="https://www.stateofdecay.com/2019/11/22/state-of-decay-2-is-coming-to-steam/">slated</a> to come to Steam in early 2020. You won't have to be worried about finding friends to play, either. The title will support four-person Xbox Live cross-play, so friends who bought the game through the Microsoft Store or on Xbox One can join you in fending off the undead.</p>
      <p>Pricing and other details are still forthcoming, although you can add the game to your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/495420/State_of_Decay_2/">wishlist</a> now if you're already intrigued by it.</p>
      <p>This <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/07/killer-instinct-on-steam-supports-xbox-one-and-windows-10-cros/">isn't the first</a> Microsoft Store-centric game to make the leap to Steam. However, it is an acknowledgment that Steam represents a large audience that's hard to ignore. Even if there aren't many potential customers left by the time <i>State of Decay</i> arrives (it'll be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/07/state-of-decay-2-release-date-May-22-Xbox-PC/">nearly two years old</a> by the time it hits Steam), it could provide enough of a boost to keep the game alive well after its debut.</p>
