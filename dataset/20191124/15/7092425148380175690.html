        <b>The Disney Store on Grafton Street has applied for planning permission for a security gate for its premises to stop homeless sleepers in its doorway.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The shop has asked Dublin City Council if they can put up steel <a href="https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/disney-grafton-street-shops-council-17308367">shutters</a> to close off access to its front door overnight.</p>
      <p>CBRE, agents for the store, have said that homeless people had been sheltering in the shop's doorway overnight and that it was being used improperly.</p>

      <p>They stated: "Staff members of the Disney store have observed the recessed doorway as being used by the homeless for sleeping, alongside apparent drug use being reported.</p>
      <p>"This activity has exposed the Disney staff to threatening behaviour and confrontation. Due to this the Garda have been contacted on multiple occasions to deal with this."</p>
      <p>According to The Sunday Times, a 3.5x3.1m gate, coated blue to match the shop, has been requested with Aviva Life and Pensions, owners of the building currently used by the Disney Store, saying that they are happy with the proposal.</p>
