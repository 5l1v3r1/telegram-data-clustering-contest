      <p>SEOUL: A former member of South Korea's top K-pop girl group was found dead on Sunday, the country's Yonhap news agency reported citing police.</p>
      <p>The body of Goo Hara, 28, was discovered at her home in southern Seoul, Yonhap said.</p>
      <p>Police were not immediately available for comment.</p>
      <p>Goo, better known as Hara in other parts of Asia, had spoken out against cyber bullying. In June, a month after she was found unconscious at her home and hospitalised, she said it was difficult to overcome depression and pleaded for positive comment on social media.</p>
      <p>She debuted with the five-member Kara in 2008. It was one of the early girl groups that helped fan the global K-pop wave, building large fan bases in Japan, China and other countries.</p>
      <p>After a deal with a South Korean management agency was terminated, Goo launched a career as a solo artist in Japan and held a concert there this month.</p>
      <p>Another K-pop star, Sulli, a former member of girl group f(x), who was a close friend of Goo's and had also spoken out against cyber bullying, also died in October.</p>
