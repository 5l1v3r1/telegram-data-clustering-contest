      <p>A 'guardian angel' who saved a woman from a horror crash was left paralysed after his police car flipped into a ditch.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/cheshire-police">Constable</a> Kevin Milnes was hailed a hero by mum-of-one Angela Tudor when he rescued her from a crushed car that had <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/traffic-and-travel">collided with a lamp post</a> on Dundalk Road in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/widnes">Widnes</a> .</p>
      <p>Angela suffered multiple broken bones and severe head injuries during the crash on June 9, 1979.</p>
      <p>She says she will forever be indebted to the officer who got her out of the car but, in a cruel twist of fate, just 10 years later, Kevin was also in a serious accident that left him with brain damage, paralysed and unable to talk.</p>

      <p>Kevin lost control of his <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/cheshire-police">police car</a> on a sharp bend as he pursued a suspect in icy and foggy conditions in Great Sankey, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/warrington">Warrington</a> , on October 31, 1989.</p>
      <p>He sat injured in the car, upside down in a ditch, for hours before emergency services were made aware of the crash.</p>
      <p>Kevin ended up spending several months in hospital, and the extensive injuries he sustained forced him to retire from <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/cheshire-police">Cheshire Constabulary</a> in 1990.</p>
      <p>His <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/health/">medical problems</a> stemming from the crash have escalated over time and he is now paralysed down the left hand side of his body and unable to talk.</p>
      <p>Over 40 years on since the pair crossed paths, Angela, who is now a grandmother-of-two, recognised him on a <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/cheshire-police">Widnes Police</a> social media post several weeks ago.</p>
      <p>She got in touch with the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/cheshire-police">PCSO</a> , Stephen Marnick, who helped arrange for Angela to meet and belatedly thank the 69-year-old at the residential care home he lives in.</p>

      <p>Kevin initially did not recognise Angela during their reunion this week but towards the end of her visit something clicked and he told Angela that he does remember her crash, even detailing the precise location in which it occurred.</p>
      <p>Angela, 63, said: “It was a highly emotional experience meeting Kevin again after all these years.</p>
      <p>“He was my guardian angel when I was in a car crash more than 40 years ago.</p>
      <p>“I sustained a fractured and dislocated ankle and also broke my pelvis and two bones in my leg.</p>

      <p>“I woke up thinking that I was going to die, but thankfully Kevin was there to reassure and help me.</p>
      <p>“He was so calm and professional and he got me out of the car so that I could be taken to hospital in an ambulance.</p>
      <p>“I have never forgotten what he did for me that day, during what was probably the most frightening experience of my life.</p>
      <p>“I will be forever indebted to him for it, and I am so pleased that I have been able to see him again and belatedly thank him for being so fantastic during my time of need."</p>
      <p>Kevin, who is from Oldham and worked as a traffic officer in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/crime">Widnes</a> , <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/st-helens">St Helens</a> and Northwich, said: “I really enjoyed being a police officer, and it is nice thinking back about all the people I helped whilst doing the job, including Angela.”</p>
      <p>Kevin was once commended for excellent police work in effecting the arrest of two men in difficult circumstances.</p>
      <p>Angela, who worked as a paramedic information assistant at Halton Hospital before retiring, added: “I just hope that Kevin had a guardian angel of his own after his crash."</p>
