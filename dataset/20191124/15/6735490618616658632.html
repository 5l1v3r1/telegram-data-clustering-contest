      <h1>Billie Eilish Sets The Record Straight About Video Of Autograph Seekers Booing Her</h1>

      <p>A video surfaced last week of Billie Eilish exiting after her performance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”, when a group of autograph-seekers frantically call her name and wind up booing her after she walks away without signing autographs.</p>
      <p>The video has led the “Bad Guy” singer to be criticized for her poor treatment of fans. However, Eilish is firing back to explain the video doesn’t tell the entire story.</p>

      <p>In a video she shared on Instagram Story (and later posted on YouTube), the 17-year-old singer explains that there were actually two groups waiting outside Kimmel’s studio — legit fans and others who are professional autograph hunters who get celebrities to sign photos and merch that they then sell at a profit.</p>
      <p>“The only reason I’m making this video is that I saw a video of this all happening and I just wanted to clarify what actually happened… because if you watch the video it looks like I’m walking by a bunch of fans and completely ignoring them and not saying hi to them, which is not what happened,” Eilish says in her video.</p>

      <p>“I started to walk away because I realized none of these people actually cared about anything that had to do with me as a person,” she continued.</p>
      <p>“I walked over there only to say hi, only to hug people and I got pictures of me shoved into my f**king face. I got no love whatsoever, so I left and then I got booed and [got] called a little b***h and got told I was going to lose my Grammy nominations,” she said of the autograph seekers.</p>
      <p>“The fact that people can switch up like that… damn,” she added. “They wait outside for you and then immediately they don’t get what they want and they boo you and f**king curse at you. I’m like, ‘Bro, I’m 17.’”</p>
