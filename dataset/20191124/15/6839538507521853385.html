      <p>Former New York Mayor and media and finance tycoon Michael Bloomberg brings a huge personal fortune and moderate views to the race for the Democratic nomination.</p>
      <p>The media and finance tycoon, New York City’s last three-term mayor and 14th-richest man in the world, declared to supporters in a launch video and statement, “I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America. We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions.”</p>
      <p>“He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage. The stakes could not be higher. We must win this election. And we must begin rebuilding America.</p>
      <p>"I believe my unique set of experiences in business, government, and philanthropy will enable me to win and lead,” Mr Bloomberg said.</p>

      <p>He faces a tough fight to win the nomination over top tier Democratic candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders who have been campaigning for months, including five debates.</p>
      <p>Mr Bloomberg, 77, will enter tied for fifth place, polls show.</p>
      <p>But the debate stumbles of Mr Biden, 77, coupled with the unexpected strength of the twin far-left candidacies of Sen Warren, 70, and Sen Sanders, 78, left Mr Bloomberg and his advisors worried Democrats could select a nominee unable to beat President Trump, 73, in 2020, sources told <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/michael-bloomberg-officially-declares-white-house-bid/"><i>The Post</i></a>.</p>
      <p>His advisors believe the mogul’s $52 billion fortune ($A77b) and willingness to self-fund means he can catapult himself into contention.</p>
      <p>Mr Bloomberg’s official declaration follows two stunning reversals — and apologies — from the famously stubborn politician as he plotted his entry into the race.</p>
      <p>The first came Thursday when he apologised for sexist remarks he made while leading his eponymous Midtown media empire through a spokesman.</p>
      <p>His second stunned New York City — reversing his decade of unquestioned public support for the NYPD’s controversial "stop-and-frisk" policy that was ruled unconstitutional and fueled a political backlash that elected his successor, Mayor de Blasio.</p>

      <p>Already, Mr Bloomberg has vowed to spend at least $A220 million of his fortune on various pieces of a 2020 campaign, including more than $100 million for internet ads attacking Mr Trump, between $20 million and $30 million on a voter registration drive largely targeting minority voters, and $50 million on an initial round of television ads.</p>
      <p>The online advertisements Mr Bloomberg is funding — which are slated to begin running Friday — will target four states expected to be hotly contested during the 2020 election: Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump won all of the states in 2016, but public opinion polls have shown that he is vulnerable as the 2020 election shapes up.</p>
      <p>Mr Bloomberg earned plaudits from Democrats for pumping millions into the 2018 midterm elections to help the party’s candidates across the country.</p>

      <p>The crowded field of Democrats vying for president has largely been focused on the primary contest.</p>
      <p>Some Democratic leaders are growing increasingly concerned that a nasty primary fight won by the party’s progressive and liberal wings could give Mr Trump a chance to gain ground in during the northern spring and summer of 2020.</p>
      <p>The president’s reelection campaign has started spending heavily on online advertising, using the war chest he has already begun to amass to target general election voters.</p>
      <p>A lifelong Democrat, Mr Bloomberg switched to the Republicans in 2001 and served as Mayor (initially Republican, later Independent) from 2002-2013.</p>
      <p>Mr Bloomberg's philanthropy focuses on the environment, public health, the arts, government innovation and education. To date, he has donated $A12 billion.</p>
