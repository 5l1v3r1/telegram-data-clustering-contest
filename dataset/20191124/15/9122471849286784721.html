      <h1>3 Head Coaches On The Hot Seat Following Week 13</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:51:36+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Just one week remains in the 2019 college football regular season. The postseason is almost here, which means the head coaching carousel is about to get going, too.</p>
      <p>There have already been a couple of major firings this season, with Rutgers firing Chris Ash, Florida State firing Willie Taggart and Arkansas firing Chad Morris.</p>
      <p>More moves are probably coming.</p>
      <p>Here are three head coaches on the hot seat after Week 13.</p>
      <h3>Miami head coach Manny Diaz</h3>
      <p>Diaz is less than one full season into his head coaching career at Miami, but there are already some Hurricanes fans who want him gone.</p>
      <p>Miami suffered a devastating upset loss to FIU on Saturday night. You just can’t lose that game if you’re Diaz.</p>
      <p>The Hurricanes probably won’t make a change this offseason, but it wouldn’t be shocking if they did.</p>

      <h3>Texas head coach Tom Herman</h3>
      <p>Like Diaz, Herman probably isn’t going to get fired after this season. But the Longhorns expected a hell of a lot more in Year 3 this fall.</p>
      <p>Texas was dominated by Baylor on Saturday, falling to 6-5 on the season. The Longhorns entered the season with College Football Playoff hopes and now they’ll barely make a bowl game.</p>
      <p>It’s not even close to good enough.</p>

      <h3>USC head coach Clay Helton</h3>
      <p>Helton remains on this list and the odds suggest that USC will be making a change at head coach this offseason. The Trojans finished the regular season strong, though, and Helton is making a push to keep his job.</p>
      <p>There is reportedly internal support for Helton and, if USC doesn’t think it can get an Urban Meyer or James Franklin, perhaps they’ll wait another year before making a decision.</p>
      <p>Helton <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/espn-insider-latest-on-clay-heltons-future-at-usc">had a strong message</a> for his new athletic director following Saturday’s win over UCLA, too.</p>
