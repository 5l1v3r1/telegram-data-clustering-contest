      <p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-feud-kamala-harris.html">Kamala Harris</a> might not be <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/11/kamala-harris-home-state-heartburn.html">doing so hot</a> in her home state, but at least America’s Cool Aunt™ is ignoring her constituents for a very cool and hip reason: She wants those viral moments, baby. Momma needs a GIF! So please allow her (<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/maya-rudolphs-booksmart-cameo-is-a-tribute-to-bridesmaids.html">Maya Rudolph</a>) to work through three potential meme scenarios for 15 minutes of quick Internet fame, even though — rookie mistake — only one of them is TikTok related. “Tonight I’m not going to worry about the polling numbers. I’m just gonna have fun and see if I can get some viral moments,” she explains. “The Democratic party needs to stop taking black women for granted. Especially one black woman: me. C’mon, you said you would vote for me.” Ermahgerd gersberms, indeed.</p>
