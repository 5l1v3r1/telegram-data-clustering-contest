      <h1>Schiff dismisses Trump's call for him to testify: 'What would I offer in terms of testimony?'</h1>

      <p>House Intelligence Committee Chairman <a href="https://thehill.com/people/adam-schiff">Adam Schiff</a> (D-Calif.) on Sunday dismissed President <a href="https://thehill.com/person/trump">Trump</a>'s call for the congressman to testify in the Senate's impeachment trial. </p>
      <p>"What would I offer in terms of testimony? That I heard [former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia Fiona Hill] say such and such?" Schiff said on CNN's "State of the Union."</p>
      <p>"The only reason for them to go through this is to mollify the president, and that’s not a good reason to call a member of Congress," Schiff added. </p>
      <p>However, Schiff did not go so far as to say he would refuse to testify if the Senate called him to do so. </p>
      <p>"I don't want to comment on it," Schiff said on whether he would appear. </p>
      <p>Schiff said if Republicans "go down this road" it would show a "fundamental lack of seriousness" and turn the impeachment trial into a "circus like the president would like." </p>
      <p>Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1198259181104586752">tweeted Saturday</a> that Schiff "will be compelled to testify should the Democrats decide, despite the fact that my presidential conversations were totally appropriate (perfect), to go forward with the Impeachment Hoax."</p>
