      <h1>MVP Secures Sensational Walk-Off KO In Bellator London Main Event</h1>

        <b>Michael Venom Page picked up another highlight reel knockout on Saturday night as he defeated Giovanni Melillo in the main event of Bellator London.</b>
      </p>
      <p>MVP, who is without doubt one of the biggest stars in the promotion, was originally supposed to fight Dereck Anderson but after he pulled out, the hometown favourite was handed Italian Giovanni Mellilo on short notice.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old was his ever confident self in London and it only took him a minute and a half of the first round to secure the victory as he landed with a huge right-hand to finish Mellilo.</p>

      <p>Page was expected to dominate and did so in a similar style to<a href="https://punditarena.com/mma/ccunningham/mvp-ko-kiely/"> how he defeated Richard Kiely at Bellator Dublin</a> just eight weeks ago.</p>
      <p>After the bout, Page called out current Bellator welterweight champion Douglas Lima, who defeated him in May as he looks to avenge the only loss on his professional MMA record.</p>
