      <p>Nov. 24 (UPI) -- This weekend's edition of <i>Saturday Night Live</i> featured a star-studded parody of the most recent Democratic presidential debate.</p>
      <p>Playing candidates <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Andrew-Yang/?tps=1">Andrew Yang</a>, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Pete-Buttigieg/?tps=1">Pete Buttigieg</a>, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Cory_Booker/?tps=1">Cory Booker</a>, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Elizabeth_Warren/?tps=1">Elizabeth Warren</a> and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Tulsi-Gabbard/?tps=1">Tulsi Gabbard</a> were current <i>SNL</i> players Bowen Yang, Colin Jost, Chris Redd, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kate-McKinnon/?tps=1">Kate McKinnon</a> and Cecily Strong.</p>
      <p>Several other celebrities popped in to play the remaining contenders.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Amy_Klobuchar/?tps=1">Amy Klobuchar</a> was played by Rachel Dratch, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Michael_Bloomberg/?tps=1">Michael Bloomberg</a> by Fred Armisen, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Bernie_Sanders/?tps=1">Bernie Sanders</a> by <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Larry_David/?tps=1">Larry David</a>, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Joe_Biden/?tps=1">Joe Biden</a> by <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Woody_Harrelson/?tps=1">Woody Harrelson</a> and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kamala_Harris/?tps=1">Kamala Harris</a> by <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Maya_Rudolph/?tps=1">Maya Rudolph</a>.</p>
      <p>The episode's guest host and <i>SNL</i> alum <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Will_Ferrell/?tps=1">Will Ferrell</a> played candidate Tom Steyer.</p>
      <p>Asked by moderator Rachel Maddow (Melissa Villasenor) who can beat incumbent <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a>, Warren leaped over her podium, "Me, me, me, me, me!"</p>
      <p>"I've got mom-hosting-Thanksgiving energy. I'ma little overwhelmed because I thought 10 people were coming and now there's 30 million. But I promise dinner will be ready if you just get out of the kitchen and stop asking questions," Warren said.</p>
      <p>Calling herself "America's fun aunt," Harris revealed she planned to be playful and create some "viral moments" during the debate.</p>
      <p>"Mama needs a gif," she said.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg, allegedly wearing a suit from his First Holy Communion ceremony when he was a child, gestured to his appearance when asked why he thinks he is polling at zero with black voters.</p>
      <p>Sanders claimed he was the first heart attack sufferer to go to the hospital on a city bus.</p>
      <p>"I did have a heart attack-ack-ack-ack, but you ought to know by now, I'm doing better than ever," Sanders said, quoting the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Billy_Joel/?tps=1">Billy Joel</a> song "Movin' Out."</p>
      <p>Klobuchar insisted she wasn't trembling because she is nervous.</p>
      <p>"It's just my spidey sense that tingles whenever we need a moderate to say, 'Girl, we can't pay for that!'"</p>
      <p>Biden said: "America, I see you and I see the faces you all make. When I talk, you're scared. You're scared I'll say something off-color, or worse, on color.</p>
      <p>"What an honor it is to be on this stage with my fellow candidates. I want you to know that I smell your fear and it makes me stronger. I'm wearing the white suit of your fallen hero <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Hillary_Clinton/?tps=1">Hillary Clinton</a>. Fight me, cowards," Gabbard said.</p>
