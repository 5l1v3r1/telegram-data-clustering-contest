      <p>Rangers now turn their attention to Thursday's Europa League clash with Feyenoord, with a win at De Kuip meaning the Light Blues follow Celtic into the last 32.</p>
      <p>But Gerrard says his team will need to sharpen up.</p>
      <p>"It's another positive result and three points away from home against a team who were very competitive and gave their manager everything they had," he said. "So you have to give Hamilton a lot of respect and credit.</p>
      <p>"Our performance was very mixed. At times, we looked like we had a lot of quality and created lots of chances. But, at times, we looked a bit vulnerable as well.</p>
      <p>"We haven't been ruthless or defended well enough. We have to be better in the final third and kill teams off.</p>
      <p>"We'll need to find a better performance than today. Today was good enough because we win the game and the points we've got are important.</p>
      <p>"But we're going into a game away to Feyenoord we'll need to find a better performance."</p>
      <p>Defeat sees Hamilton drop to second bottom but manager Brian Rice insists his men are not going down lightly.</p>
      <p>He said: "We are going to be in a dogfight. Let's not make any mistakes about that. There are going to be five or six teams in a dogfight and we are going to be one of them.</p>
      <p>"But I'll tell you one thing: we are always up for a fight. You saw a team out there today that never gave up.</p>
      <p>"They play for one another, for me and for the club. There will be good days and there will be bad days."</p>
