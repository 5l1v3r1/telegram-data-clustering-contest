      <h3>#DXclusives: MC Hammer, Princess and Diamond of Crime Mob and The Breakdown with Page Kennedy</h3>
      <h4>MC Hammer Reveals Why He Strived To Be ‘A Complete Artist’ Instead Of Just A Rapper</h4>
      <p>In an interview with HipHopDX, MC Hammer shared why he chose to be more than a rapper.</p>
      <p>“Today, I would say entertainer, but I would also use the word artist, more complete artist. Because you know, rapping is literally one aspect,” he said. “You have people who are really good at rapping and they call themselves a lyricist. They are good at the verse and may not be good at picking beats. They may not be good at production. They may not be good at mixing. They may not be good at performing.”</p>
      <p>Check out the entire MC Hammer interview <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53523/title.mc-hammer-reveals-why-he-strived-to-be-a-complete-artist-instead-of-just-a-rapper?fbclid=IwAR3s60ZXmoQYlZ_O6HF08LaD-YSzn7GmbqQuKe50eg_MpsXGP-UEfS0B2sk">here</a>.</p>
      <h4>Princess &amp; Diamond Talk Upcoming Album, Female Rappers &amp; Crime Mob’s Mature New Sound</h4>
      <p>DX caught up with Princess and Diamond from Crime Mob, and the two opened up about performing with Solange at Met Gala after missing Coachella.</p>
      <p>“So, at that time, her album had already been out, we’d already heard the sample, and we were just super excited that she wanted us to come out for her Met Gala after-party to perform,” Princess recalled. “And from there, just like meeting her in person and talking to her again, it was an instant vibe, it felt so good to just be appreciated [for being] ourselves — the hair, the tattoos, the style. It motivated us to get together, and to realize how much power that we have together. ‘Cause at one point, me and Princess were doing our own things, solo.”</p>
