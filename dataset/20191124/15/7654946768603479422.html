      <p>Will Ferrell returned to Saturday Night Live this weekend to help “keep the quid pro quo on the low-low.”</p>
      <p>The comedy legend, hosting SNL for the fifth time, donned a bald cap to play ambassador Gordon Sondland in a cold-open skit in which he embarrassed Alec Baldwin’s President Trump.</p>
      <p>Trump was initially shown alone, using his waiting Marine One helicopter on the White House lawn as an excuse to avoid questions about “this impeachment nonsense” from an eager press pack.</p>
      <p>“I can’t hear you that good because of this lousy chopper behind me,” the president said when asked about Sondland’s “damning” testimony.</p>
      <p>“It sounded like you said Sondland’s testimony completely exonerated me, and I totally agree,” he said.</p>
      <p>He then showed off his handwritten notes that “proves my innocence,” bragging about using “the biggest, fattest, blackest Magic Marker I could find,” poking fun at the real-life Trump’s own notes this week.</p>
      <p>Baldwin’s fake Trump denied even knowing his ambassador for the EU, calling it “fake news” — just for Ferrell’s Sondland to bound up next to him, making it clear they were well acquainted.</p>
      <p>“It’s so great to finally meet you for the first time,” Trump said nervously to Sondland, trying to appear strangers.</p>
      <p>‘Right, right, right … keep the quid pro quo on the low-low. Got it,” Ferrell’s Sondland replied knowingly.</p>
      <p>“I just want to go on the record and say you guys need to lay off my boy — everybody loves his a–,” Sondland said, using the phrase the real Sondland <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/gordon-sondland-i-told-trump-that-ukraine-president-loves-your-ass/">said of Ukraine’s President Zelensky’s feelings</a> for Trump.</p>
      <p>Baldwin’s Trump initially seemed pleased at the praise — until he realized where Sondland was going with it.</p>
      <p>“Ukraine, Russia — they’ll do anything for this man,” Ferrell’s Sondland said as he ended the skit.</p>
      <p>“I know — I asked.”</p>
