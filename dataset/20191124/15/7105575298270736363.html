      <h1>Everything We Know About 'The Crown' Season 4</h1>

      <p>The third season of Netflix's hit royal bio-drama <i><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a19592715/the-crown-season-3-spoilers-release-date-cast-news-plot/">The Crown</a></i> just premiered, and we're already getting new intel about Season <i>4</i>. Praise the TV spoiler gods. Here's everything we know so far about <i>The Crown</i> Season 4.</p>
      <h3>Release Date</h3>
      <p>There's no word yet on when <i>The Crown's</i> fourth season will premiere. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80025678">Season 3 dropped this November</a> and Seasons 1 and 2 dropped in November 2016 and December 2017, respectively, so a November/December 2020 release date seems possible.</p>
      <h3>Filming</h3>
      <p>According to a recent casting announcement tweet from Netflix, Season 4 is in production as of September 2019, but not much else is known about the filming locations and schedule just yet.</p>
      <p><i>The Crown</i>'s creator, Peter Morgan, revealed in early 2018 that Seasons 3 and 4 were being filmed back-to-back. "We’re doing them back-to-back. I’m writing them all at the moment," he <a href="https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/the-crown-seasons-3-4-olivia-colemans-netflix-1202710866/">said</a>. "We’ve got Olivia, which is fantastic, and now we’re just embarking on the process of casting."</p>
      <p>We also got some behind-the scene photos of Diana and Charles that look incredible and very true to life, so fans are already deeply excited about the coming season. (It also confused people a little bit about exactly when Diana would show up, but now we know that it's season 4.)</p>

      <p>The very tail end of season 3 feels like a bit of a placeholder for epic and important events in the Royal Family, so season 4 is going to be hotly anticipated. But season 3 already laid the groundwork for Charles' initial relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles and their ultimate breakup, so that season 4 doesn't have to rush through events.</p>
      <h3>Cast</h3>
      <p>In keeping with the trend set with the series' first two seasons, the principal cast are playing their characters for at least <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/the-crown-olivia-colman-claire-foy-blue-eyes-netflix-1203327227/">two seasons</a>, meaning we can expect to see <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/g4184/young-photos-of-queen-elizabeth-and-princess-margaret/">Olivia Colman, Helena Bonham Carter</a>, and the rest of the key players return as their characters in Season 4. Season 4 ended with the divorce between Princess Margaret and Tony Snowdon, so we may not see Ben Higgins again in the latter role.</p>
      <p>The fourth season will also add some new cast members. Notably, Emma Corrin is set to play Lady Diana Spencer. Netflix has also confirmed that Gillian Anderson will join <i>The Crown</i> in Season 4 as Margaret Thatcher, Great Britain's first female prime minister.</p>
      <p>"I am so excited to be joining the cast and crew of 'The Crown' and to have the opportunity to portray such a complicated and controversial woman," <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCrownNetflix/status/1170309649167523845">Gillian said in a tweet</a>. "Thatcher was undoubtedly formidable but I am relishing exploring beneath the surface and dare I say, falling in love with the icon who, whether loved or despised, defined an era."</p>

      <p>There's already speculation about who will play Elizabeth in seasons 5 and 6: Imelda Staunton is apparently currently in talks, although <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/the-crown-imelda-staunton-queen-elizabeth-netflix-1203412448/">Netflix</a> issued a statement saying that she hasn't officially been cast yet as previous reports had suggested.</p>
      <p>“We are currently filming season 4 of <i>The Crown</i> but have not commissioned any further seasons as yet, therefore any news on casting remains pure speculation," Netflix said in its statement.</p>
      <p>If you're wondering, <i>Where do I know Imelda Staunton from?</i> it's because she was in <i>Harry Potter</i> as the hated Dolores Umbridge. This would be a <i>very </i>different role if she does end up being the choice, although the two have a certain poshness in common.</p>

      <h3>Plot</h3>
      <p>While details about the plot of <i>The Crown</i> Season 4 haven't been explicitly revealed, we can guess at key plot points by looking to history. According to <i><a href="https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/the-crown-seasons-3-4-olivia-colemans-netflix-1202710866/">Variety</a></i>, Season 3 will cover 1964-1976. Going by this amount of time, season 4 will cover, potentially, the late 1970s into the early 1990s. This includes what fans are dying to see: Charles and Diana (despite early reports that we might see Diana at the very tail end of season 3).</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Seasons 1 and 2 covered Queen Elizabeth's life from 1947 until 1964—a 17-year period. If Seasons 3 and 4 continued that exact trend, Season 4 would end in 1981. Although this would leave Season 4 covering a relatively short period of time, 1981 does offer a few significant royal moments.</p>
      <p>Not only was it the year <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/g22685783/prince-charles-princess-diana-relationship-timeline-photos/">Charles and Diana tied the knot</a>, the 1981 Trooping the Colour also marked a scary incident for Elizabeth. During that year's celebration, someone fired six shots (which were later discovered to be blanks) at Elizabeth while she rode on horseback during the procession.</p>
      <p>It's also possible that Season 4 will lean on other significant moments in Charles and Diana's lives as cutoff points, with the birth of Prince William and Diana's tragic and untimely death in 1997 as contenders.</p>
      <p>The creative team behind <i>The Crown </i>have gone on record saying the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/crown-will-run-six-seasons-netflix-boss-ted-sarandos-948671">show is intended to last for six seasons</a>, which means that, wherever Season 4 ends, that will leave Seasons 5 and 6 (and the actors cast for them) to cover the remainder of Elizabeth's reign up until present day. So the 1990s and 2000s may be covered in these seasons.</p>
      <p>We'll update when we know more.</p>
