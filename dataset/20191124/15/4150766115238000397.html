      <p>Three women were found dead between Wednesday and Saturday in Phnom Penh and Svay Rieng and Kandal provinces.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Svay Rieng</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kem Pisal, a 24-year-old factory worker, was found dead with her throat slit on Wednesday at Svay Rieng’s Kandieng Reay commune, in Svay Teap district.</p>
      <p>Svay Teap district deputy police chief Kim Socheat said the victim was presumably killed by a man who was also working in the same factory. Police found the body of the suspect floating in a pond in the province’s Kampong Chak commune, in Romduol district.</p>
      <p>Socheat said: “The suspect might have gone there to wash away the blood [of the victim] but slipped and drowned in the pond.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kandal province</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Kandal province, police are searching for Khut Sophal who is suspected to have killed his wife Yat Srey Pov, 49, on Thursday in Tonhup Thom commune, Ponhea Leu district.</p>
      <p>Penh Vutty, Ponhea Leu district police’s criminal section chief said, “The killing could be due to domestic violence.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Phnom Penh</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lastly, meat vendor Lang Sao Ly, 41, was found dead on Saturday in Phnom Penh’s Trapaing Krasang commune at Por Sen Chey district.</p>
      <p>Por Sen Chey district police chief Yim Saran told The Post on Sunday that Sao Ly was suspected to have been killed by her husband, Reach Vann Touch, before he took his own life, leaving three children behind.</p>
      <p>“The neighbours said the family often quarrelled. So we think that this could be due to domestic violence,” said Saran.</p>
      <p>Trapaing Krasang commune police chief Pal Yutha said an autopsy revealed the victim died of suffocation. Police suspect that the husband could have used a pillow to suffocate Sao Ly while she was asleep. The husband was found hanged at the scene.</p>
      <p>The couple were said to have had a long argument the evening before. The next morning, the two were found dead.</p>
      <p>“The husband is said to have told the village chief that he was in debt and that he wanted to commit suicide,” Yutha said.</p>
