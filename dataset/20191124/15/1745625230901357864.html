      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/natalie-roser/">Natalie Roser</a> is turning up the heat again on her <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> page.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, November 23, the Australian model shared two smoking hot snaps to her page that gave her 1.1 million followers a glimpse at her “weekend vibes,” and they can’t seem to get enough. The double Instagram update saw the 29-year-old sitting at a small wooden table, with sunlight spilling in from two large windows in front of her.</p>
      <p>The first photo of the set showed Natalie pouring herself a glass of red wine and looking smoking hot as she did so. Her look included a tiny orange bikini top with thin shoulder straps and a low neckline that exposed an ample amount of cleavage. Instead of the matching bikini bottoms, the babe opted for a gorgeous paisley skirt that sat high up on her hips to accentuate her trim waist. She rested her long legs on top of another chair in front of her, giving fans a good look at her sculpted stems.</p>
      <p>A swipe to the second photo of the series saw the model with her body turned toward the camera as she sipped from her glass, giving her fans a better look at her impressive physique. The change in position revealed that her sexy bikini top boasted a tight knotted detail that fell right in the middle of her chest, drawing even more attention to her busty display. Natalie’s audience was also treated to a better view of her flat midsection and abs, much to their delight.</p>
      <p>The Aussie beauty completed her ensemble with a set of delicate hoop earrings that gave it a bit of bling. She wore her platinum tresses in a loose bun, and sported a minimal makeup look that included a dusting of blush, shimmering highlighter, and thick coat of mascara that made her striking features and natural beauty shine.</p>

      <p>Natalie often dazzles her fans with snaps of her incredible figure. Earlier this month, she treated them to a photo from her trip to the Bahamas that earned recognition for more reasons than one. The babe was captured posing on a gorgeous beach and flaunting her assets in a <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5738372/natalie-roser-mismatched-bikini/">skimpy, mismatched bikini</a>.
