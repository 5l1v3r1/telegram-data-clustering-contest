      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/airbnb">Airbnb</a> users can finally live like a royal in this £8,000-a-night palace suite which has opened to well-to-do tourists with deep pockets.</p>
      <p>The Gudliya Suite at the 300-year-old City Palace in the northern city of Jaipur is among the most expensive Airbnb rentals and it could be the most extravagant one as well.</p>
      <p>The 21 -year-old Maharaja Sawai Padmanabh Singh, who is said to have a fortune of up to £660million, is the first royal to host on the platform.</p>
      <p>Guests are pampered by royal staff, including a personal butler, during their stay at a landmark which has hosted the likes of Princess Diana, Bill Clinton, Jacqueline Kennedy and Oprah Winfrey in the past.</p>
      <p>The one-bed suite is located within a private section with almost two dozen amenities, including an indoor pool, hot tub, garden and meals made by the palace's chef.</p>
