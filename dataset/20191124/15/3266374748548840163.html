        <b>Brandon Williams starts ahead of Ashley Young, while Manchester United line up with a back-three as they get set to take on Sheffield United at Bramall Lane.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has made a solitary change to the side that beat Brighton &amp; Hove Albion last time out as Manchester United prepare to lock horns with Sheffield United at Bramall Lane.</p>
      <p>The eye-catching decision sees Solskjaer name his side in what seems to be a 3-4-3 formation. Phil Jones is the only change, replacing the injured Scott McTominay. Jones lines up in the back-three, with Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire as his partners, while David de Gea retains his place in goal.</p>

      <p>McTominay’s absence means Andreas Pereira starts in a withdrawn role in midfield, with Fred for company in the middle of the park. Interestingly, Brandon Williams keeps hold of his place, even though Ashley Young is available again after serving his suspension.</p>
      <p>Williams is the left wing-back, with Aaron Wan-Bissaka being deployed on the opposite flank. Up ahead in attack, there is no looking past Daniel James, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial to fill up the three slots. Young is among the backup options on the bench, alongside the fit-again Axel Tuanzebe.</p>
      <p><b>Manchester United Starting XI:</b> de Gea; Jones, Lindelof, Maguire; Wan-Bissaka, Pereira, Fred, Williams; James, Martial, Rashford</p>
