      <h1>Jeremy Clarkson makes shock confession that he now believes in climate change</h1>
      <h2>The former host of Top Gear had his mind changed when he travelled down stream in a river race in Asia</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:55:20+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror .co.uk</a></address>
      <p>It seems hell may have frozen over as notorious petrol head Jeremy Clarkson has signalled he is ready to turn green after witnessing the troubling impact of climate change.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-clarkson">The 59-year-old former Top Gear star</a> (who now stars on Amazon’s high octane car reviewing show The Grand Tour) seems to have had a change of heart after witnessing dramatic changes to landscapes in South East Asia.</p>
      <p>Jezza, who has long expressed his love for petrol guzzling machinery, felt the penny drop while filming a boat race from Cambodia to Vietnam on The Grand Tour.</p>
      <p>The high speed race slowed to a snails pace, however, when they were travelling through Tonlé Sap lake in the Mekong river system which had been reduced to not much more than a “trickle”, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/jeremy-clarkson-is-a-climate-change-believer-gfcw0txjj">he told The Sunday Times.</a></p>

      <p>“The irony is not lost on me. A man who hosted a car programme for 30 years, limited to 7mph by global warming,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s the first time that we’ve ever admitted to there being global warming… there was no water in the Tonle Sap lake. I mean, it was knee-deep. And you could paddle in it. So we had two days of absolute frustration - being towed and grounded,” he confessed.</p>
      <p>Jeremy’s realisation comes just three weeks since <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10261846/greta-thunberg-kids-terrified/">he attempted to suggest global warming could be good for everyone</a> in a column for The Sun.</p>

      <p>He wrote comparing the current climate situation to past changes in the environment where past changes in environment led to the creation of “warmer and wetter” landscapes allowing mankind to thrive around the world.</p>
      <p>“That’s the thing about climate change. We keep being told the next shift will be a disaster for mankind. But who knows? You might wake up one morning to find your garden full of unicorns and mermaids and big chests full of jewels and money,” he wrote at the time.</p>
      <p>He has also previously slated child prodigy climate campaigner Greta Thunberg, recently writing after she spoke at the UN: “We gave you mobile phones and laptops and the internet. We created the social media you use every day and we run the banks that pay for it all. So how dare you stand there and lecture us, you spoilt brat.”</p>
