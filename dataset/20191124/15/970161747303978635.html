        <b>EastEnders cast have been filming what look set to be Keanu Taylor’s (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/danny-walters/">Danny Walters</a>) exit from the soap this Christmas. It’s no secret that Danny has called time on his tenure in the soap – but is he fleeing after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/phil-mitchell/">Phil Mitchell</a> (Steve McFadden) prepares to kill him?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It has already been confirmed that Phil will discover the truth about Keanu’s affair with Sharon (Letitia Dean) in a dramatic festive showdown. <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/08/eastenders-spoilers-keanu-taylor-die-shocking-christmas-stunt-10882229/">Danny has promised ‘drama and stunts’ for the big day</a> and pictures recently showed him caught up in an armed hostage situation with Martin Fowler (James Bye).</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>A desperate Martin is seen brandishing a gun and holding Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) captive. Keanu becomes involved in the showdown and given that Ben (Max Bowden) previously had a hold over Martin – and Phil still does – it could be that he has been instructed to kill Keanu.</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/03/eastenders-spoilers-keanu-taylor-shot-dead-martin-fowler-christmas-11033980/">With a shot ringing out, it looked to all that Keanu was destined to be killed off</a>. But these brand new pictures show another twist to the tail as Keanu, under the guise of a baseball cap (subtle) says a furtive goodbye to his mum Karen (Lorraine Stanley).</p>

      <p>The stars were filming the scenes at Stanstead Airport and it appears to suggest that Keanu will somehow manage to survive the wrath of a seething Phil. A source has suggested that Martin has set up Keanu’s getaway – is he set to lie about his mission being accomplished?</p>

      <p>Martin might have done some dark things recently but murder might be beyond even his conscience.</p>
      <p>Whatever happens, the dramatic storyline will see the end of Keanu – and his mum Karen sees him off. Whether these are his final scenes or another twist follows remains to be seen.</p>

      <p>But there are other storyline developments to take place with Louise (Tilly Keeper) set to give birth to Keanu’s baby and a pregnant Sharon still carrying his offspring.</p>
