      <p>Pressure on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/unai-emery/"><b>Unai Emery</b></a> increased on Saturday following a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/result/result-alexandre-lacazette-salvages-point-for-arsenal-against-struggling-saints_380372.html">2-2 draw</a> with Southampton that leaves the Gunners with a record of one win from their last seven games.</p>
      <p>Victory on Thursday, however, would confirm Arsenal as winners of Group F, allowing for Emery to rest players for the final fixture against Standard Liege.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> rounds up the latest injury and suspension news for the Gunners ahead of this fixture.</p>

      <p><b>Status:</b> Out<br/><b>Type of injury:</b> Thigh<br/><b>Possible return date:</b> December 21 (vs. Everton)</p>
      <p>The Spaniard picked up a thigh injury whilst on international duty that was at first not thought to be serious, but now looks set to keep him out for another month.</p>

      <p><b>Status:</b> Minor doubt<br/><b>Type of injury:</b> Thigh<br/><b>Possible return date:</b> November 28 (vs. Eintracht Frankfurt)</p>
      <p>Kolasinac was assessed ahead of the meeting with Southampton after returning from international duty with a tight hamstring, with Emery ultimately deciding against risking the defender. However, he looks set to return to action on Thursday.</p>

        <b>Rob Holding</b>
      </p>

      <p><b>Status:</b> Major doubt<br/><b>Type of injury:</b> Knee<br/><b>Possible return date:</b> November 28 (vs. Eintracht Frankfurt)</p>
      <p>The defender has recovered from a long-term knee injury, making a comeback in September, but has since aggravated the area and is unlikely to be risked during the week.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Bukayo Saka</b>
      </p>

      <p><b>Status:</b> Out<br/><b>Type of injury:</b> Knee<br/><b>Possible return date:</b> Unknown</p>
      <p>Having impressed in this competition so far this term, Saka will be disappointed to miss out on Thursday due to a knee problem that has sidelined him since the start of this month.</p>

      <p>
        <b>ARSENAL'S SUSPENSION LIST</b>
      </p>
