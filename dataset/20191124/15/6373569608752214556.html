      <h1>All the people we met on the streets of Torpoint during the 2000s</h1>
      <h2>Way back in the early to mid 2000s, we went out capturing the moments that defined the parish neighbourhood</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:19:39+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:19</time> by <a rel="author">Miles O'Leary</a></address>
      <p>Torpoint - it's the patch on the west Tamar side of Cornwall that arguably gets forgotten about.</p>
      <p>Loads of us moan about the ferry crossing - but perhaps we think less about the face it has a really strong community bursting with pride.</p>
      <p>Way back in the early to mid 2000s, we went out capturing the moments that defined the parish neighbourhood.</p>
      <p>So many lovely faces feature in our archives and so it made sense to rustle up a gallery honouring them all.</p>
      <p>Just hit the link below to take a wonderful trip back down memory lane. No doubt you'll spot a face or two that look remarkably familar.</p>
