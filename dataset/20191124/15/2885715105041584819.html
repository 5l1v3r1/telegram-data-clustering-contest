      <h2>Virat Kohli revealed some suggestions given to him by Sachin Tendulkar on how to adapt batting in Day/Night Tests played with the pink ball. Kohli's 136 was the highest score by far in the first pink ball Test in India.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:53:59+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/sports-desk/" target="_blank">Sports Desk</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/virat-kohli/">Virat Kohli</a> revealed after the 2nd Test vs Bangladesh on Sunday that some advice from <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sachin-tendulkar/">Sachin Tendulkar</a> had helped him negotiate the late swing generated with the pink ball. Kohli’s 136 was the highest score in the Test – the first Test to be played with the pink ball on Indian soil – with Mushfiqur Rahim’s 74 being the second highest individual contribution in the match.</p>
      <p>Kohli said, “Sachin Tendulkar made very interesting points that probably with the pink ball, you’ll have to treat the second session like the morning session, when it’s getting darker and the ball starts to swing and seam. So first session, you invariably play like you play from lunch to tea, in a normal timing.”</p>
      <p>“The last session is like that evening session. So you’re planning changes, you know your declaration, strategy timing, everything changes as a batsman, your setup changes. So even if you’re set and you’re batting well, as soon as it gets dark and the lights are on, you know, you can be in trouble very quickly.”</p>
      <p>While some batsmen have said that the pink ball is difficult to deal with for batsmen during twilight, Kohli, who went to bat under lights with the team at 43/2, said he felt like smashing the ball straightway like he does in IPL games.</p>
      <p>“Luckily, I went in when the lights were on, so I didn’t have to go through that transition, but I think that will be another challenge in future as well. But he under lights, it was a different experience. When I walked out, it felt like an IPL game atmosphere so you feel like smashing the first ball, but you have to remind yourself that you know you have to play compact,” he said.</p>
