      <p>There was simply no stopping Trim Celtic as they chalked up a resounding 8-0 victory over Parkvilla in the NEFL Challenge Cup semi-final at the MDL today with Jack O'Keeffe hitting a hat-trick. </p>
      <p>Nothing went right for Parkvilla who had three players sent off, two in the closing stages. </p>
      <p>It didn't take long for the Hoops, or O'Keeffe, to find their groove with the player directing the ball to the net from long-range after just two minutes. </p>
      <p>By half-time Alan Murphy's side had their final ticket all but secured when they led 3-0 with Sean Fitzgerald and Aaron Williams netting their second and third goals respectively. </p>
      <p>Parkvilla's situation wasn't helped when they had Jay Colton sent off in that opening half.</p>
      <p>A man down Parkvilla had no chance against a rampant Trim Celtic side with O'Keeffe going on to get his hat-trick in the second-half with two more goals including a penalty after he was fouled himself. </p>
      <p>Colm Carney came on to get a super goal and ,make it 6-0. In the closing stages Cillien Corcoran and Carney completed the route. Carney's second goal, and his team's eighth, came from a penalty. </p>
      <p>To complete a bad, bad day for Parkvilla they also had Andy Williamson and Gary O'Dowd dismissed in the second-half.  Trim Celtic now play Kentstown Rovers in the Challenge Cup final on Saturday 7th December, 5pm. </p>
