      <p>The Lod District Court in central Israel handed down a life sentence Sunday to the terrorist responsible for murdering a rabbi in a stabbing attack in Samaria last year.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/265841">Abdel Hakim Bin Adael Assi was convicted in July</a> of murdering <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/241610">Rabbi Itamar Ben-Gal</a>, a 29-year-old father of four, in a stabbing attack in the city of Ariel in Samaria last year.</p>
      <p>In addition to the life sentence handed down to the terrorist, the Lod District Court also ordered that he pay the Ben-Gal family 258,000 shekels ($74,320).</p>
      <p>During a hearing Sunday afternoon ahead of the sentencing, an attorney representing the terrorist called on the court to give his client a lenient sentence, but was cut off by his client, who declared to the court that he had intentionally murdered Rabbi Ben-Gal, claiming that he had done so because Israel had ‘murdered woman and children’.</p>
      <p>Attorney Haim Bleicher, who works for the Honenu organization and represents the Ben-Gal family, submitted to the judges a letter from Rabbi Ben-Gal’s parents.</p>
      <p>The letter called on the court to give the maximum punishment possible, and to ensure that the terrorist never be released in any possible trade deal.</p>
      <p>Rabbi Ben-Gal was stabbed to death at the entrance to the city of Ariel, while on his way to Har Bracha, his hometown. Ben Gal was a teacher and educator at the Bnei Akiva Yeshiva in Givat Shmuel and at the Har Bracha yeshiva.</p>
      <p>He was survived by his wife and four children.</p>
