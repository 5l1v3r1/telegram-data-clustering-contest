      <p>SEETEC has confirmed it has helped over 1,200 people in Co. Mayo into full-time and part-time employment through the JobPath service on behalf of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP).</p>
      <p>The figures are confirmed as Seetec celebrates four years of operation in the county.</p>
      <p>The service is delivered in Castlebar, Ballina, Claremorris, Belmullet and Achill where it helps the long-term unemployed back into work. It supports clients with career guidance, self-employment advice, CV support, and interview and IT training.</p>
      <p>Over 50 guests joined the Seetec team in Mayo to celebrate four years of the service. Guests included clients of the service as well as local employers, councillors, TDs, senators, training providers and members of the Intreo team in Mayo.</p>
      <p>The community event was hosted at Seetec’s centre at N5 Business Park, Moneen Road, Castlebar, and coincided with figures released by Seetec that show its Mayo team has helped 1,100 people secure full-time employment and 100 into part-time work.</p>
      <p>Seetec, which began delivering JobPath in July 2015, confirmed that it has already helped more than 24,800 people into full-time positions and 3,600 into part-time roles across Ireland, and is on track to exceed helping 30,000 people into work in the coming months.</p>
      <p>According to the latest figures published by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, over 80% of clients said they were satisfied with the JobPath service last year, and over 90% of clients said they felt that Seetec's staff tried their best for them.</p>
      <p>Paul McCole, Seetec Business Manager County Mayo, said: “It is fantastic to see Seetec has helped so many people in County Mayo into employment over its first four years here. It is very satisfying to be able to make a positive impact on our clients’ lives in helping them find sustained employment, while also providing an important service to businesses in Mayo and helping them to grow.</p>
      <p>“Our teams have worked really hard to become a valued part of the communities we serve, and I’m very proud of the positive impact we have made in County Mayo.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Michael Loftus said: “I was very impressed with the morning and what I learned about Seetec, and especially what the JobPath programme has done for the people of Mayo. I was delighted to meet staff and participants at the Seetec office in Castlebar and see the difference their support is making in helping people find sustainable employment.”</p>
