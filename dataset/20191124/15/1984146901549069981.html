      <p>The current series of Strictly Come Dancing is now well underway, with less than a month to go until this yearâ€™s winning couple lift the Glitterball trophy.</p>
      <p>And among the celebrities hoping to take home the ballroom crown is Saffron Barker.</p>
      <p>Saffron and pro partner AJ Pritchard had established themselves as one of the frontrunning couples for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly</a> 2019, earning some terrific scores for their dancing, particularly their ballroom routines, so it came as a huge shock when they landed in the bottom two last week.</p>
      <p>Other couples still in the running include Kelvin &amp; Oti, Alex &amp; Neil and Chris &amp; Karen and this weekend's results will air on BBC1 on Sunday night.</p>
      <h3>Who is Saffron Barker?</h3>
      <p>Saffron is a Youtuber from Brighton. The now 20 year old first started uploading videos to the platform while she was still at school and things took off in a big way with her video Types of Boyfriends.</p>
      <p>Uploaded in 2016, the jokey video has now amassed over 10 million views.</p>
