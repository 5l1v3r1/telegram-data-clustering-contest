        <b>Inter Milan's Italy international Nicolo Barella will undergo surgery on his right knee, the club confirmed on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Barella was forced off a soaked pitch in the final minutes of the first half of Saturday's 3-0 win under heavy rain at Torino.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old midfielder said he "felt the knee go click," with the outfit initially stating he had suffered a sprained knee.</p>
      <p>"The results revealed damage to a fragment of cartilage in his kneecap," Inter said in a statement on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"Barella will undergo arthroscopic surgery to remove the fragment."</p>
      <p>The news is a blow for coach Antonio Conte whose side are challenging for the Serie A title just a point behind champions Juventus.</p>
      <p>"He's a warrior, an important player for us," Conte said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The former Cagliari player, who has scored two goals this season including one in the Champions League, could be out for a month, according to reports in Italy.</p>
      <p>He will miss next week's key Champions League match against Slavia Prague, and Barcelona at home on December 10.</p>
      <p>Barella has also become an important player for the Azzurri as they prepare for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>He has 12 caps since making his debut in October 2018 under manager Roberto Mancini, and scored three goals.</p>
