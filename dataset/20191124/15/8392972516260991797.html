      <p>On last night's show, Try Star performed a rendition of The Greatest Show from the hit movie The Greatest Showman.</p>
      <p>Nicole hadn't even commented on the performance before Simon gave Louis a cheeky wink.</p>
      <aside>You really love this act <i>a lot.</i></aside>
      <p>"Oh my gosh this is the greatest show and that was the greatest way to open the show tonight, boys," Nicole enthused.</p>
      <p>"Seriously it's the greatest show because you have three rugby players up here who turned out to be true showmen, gentlemen. Last week you were winning wet T-shirt contests and this week you look like a million bucks."</p>

      <p>Seemingly confirming the romance rumours, Louis said: "Nicole, I agree with you but you really love this act <i>a lot</i>. And I like the fact you love them so much. She genuinely cares about them, Simon."</p>
      <p>A grinning Simon cut in: "I agree she is invested in this act. She likes the act."</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a>, Nicole, 41, and Thom, 34, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/nicole-scherzinger-secretly-dating-x-factor-celebrity-star-thom-evans/">recently spent a romantic evening together following weeks of flirting</a>.</p>

      <p>"Thom is completely Nicole's type. And for his part, Thom was smitten early on - he's always said Nicole is one of the most beautiful women in the world," a source is reported to have told the newspaper.</p>
      <p>"He fancied her long before meeting her on the show. He was initially a bit nervous about starting something up and ruining his chances on the series, but they had great chemistry from the off."</p>
      <p>The source continued: "And after weeks of texting, Thom finally plucked up the courage to ask her out, and took her for dinner."</p>
