      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers are interested in signing Southampton defender Cedric Soares, according to reports.</p>

      <p>Sporting director Kevin Thelwell recently told the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s73fRH6di4o&amp;feature=youtu.be">club’s website.</a> “We’re always going to try and do more to take us that little bit further, and hopefully we can address that in the next window.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think we need a revolution at all, we’ve got a very strong foundation and a very strong base.</p>
      <p>“We’re working across a load of leagues, continually reviewing where we are and evaluating what we need.</p>
      <p>“And then talking to the coaching staff about what positions they need before making some hard and fast decisions as we get closer to the window.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal and West Ham United are also said to be tracking Cedric and the latter are ready to make a formal bid for the full-back in January, the report adds.</p>
      <p>Cedric – who has played 33 times for Portugal – arrived on the south coast from Sporting four years ago and has made 126 appearances.</p>
