        <b>Rangers boss Steven Gerrard hailed Ryan Kent's "world class" wonder strike - but warned the rest of his stars a repeat of their sloppy second-half display against Hamilton could cost them in Rotterdam.</b>

      <p>His first - which put Rangers back in front after Accies youngster Lewis Smith had cancelled out Ryan Jack's early opener - was the pick of the bunch as he dropped a shoulder before unleashing an unstoppable left-footed drive into the top corner.</p>
      <p>Kent went on to rubber-stamp the victory with a cool stoppage-time finish but his boss was unhappy with the way his team stepped off the gas after half-time.</p>
      <p>However, he had nothing but praise for his match-winner.</p>
      <p>"I thought Ryan was terrific today for large parts of the game," said Gerrard, whose team now match leaders Celtic on 34 points. "His first goal was an absolute world-class strike. In any game, if you score a goal like that on your so-called weak side, you deserve a lot of credit for it.</p>
      <p>"The second one was a composed finish which we have been working on a lot with him. That's what he's got to keep doing, providing those moments which help his team-mates get maximum points.</p>
      <p>"I know everyone will get excited about his two goals today, he will get the headlines and rightly so.</p>
      <p>"But we still have to be patient with him because he is still searching for match fitness and sharpness, 100 per cent being at it. They are his own words.</p>
      <p>"So once we get him a little bit more tuned in and sharper, you will see more moments and displays like today.</p>
      <p>"But that's the exact reason the fans all wanted him here and why we were desperate to get the deal done - he is such an important player to us."</p>
