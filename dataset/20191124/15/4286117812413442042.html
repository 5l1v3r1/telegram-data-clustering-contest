      <p>In a major step towards enhancing jointness among the three services, India on Sunday deployed the special forces of the Army, the Navy and the Indian Air Force (IAF) to carry out counter-terrorist operations in the Kashmir Valley.</p>
      <p>The troops include the Army's Para (Special Forces), Navy's Marine Commandos (MARCOS) and Indian Air Force's Garud have been deployed in the Kashmir Valley.</p>
      <p>The special forces have been deployed under the defence ministry's Armed Forces Special Operations Division (AFSOD) which is under a Maj Gen of the Indian Army.</p>
      <p>The troops have been deployed in the area around the Srinagar city and rural areas near it. The MARCOS commandos are deployed in and around the Wular lake area while the Garud teams have been operating in the Lolab area and Hajin.</p>
      <p>The induction of the joint special troops has already started as the Army Para (SF) elements have already been inducted into an area considered to be a traditional terror hotbed.</p>
      <p>The troops will be carrying out anti-terrorist operations along with the existing Indian Army Rashtriya Rifles unit in the area.</p>
