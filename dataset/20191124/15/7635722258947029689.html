        <b>The former Mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg has announced a bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It follows weeks of speculation that the billionaire would run for president.</p>
      <p>On twitter this afternoon, he said he was “running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America.”</p>
      <p>"We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions," he said.</p>
      <p>"He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage.</p>
      <blockquote>"The stakes could not be higher.</blockquote>
      <p>“I believe my unique set of experiences in business, government and philanthropy will enable me to win and lead."</p>
      <p>Mr Bloomberg has reportedly already spent $31m (€28m) on a TV advertising campaign that promises to “rebuild the country and restore faith in the dream that defines us: where the wealthy will pay more in taxes and the middle class get their fair share.”</p>
