      <h1>The managers being tipped to replace Unai Emery at Arsenal</h1>
      <h2>Here are the latest next manager at Arsenal odds</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:48:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:48</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>The pressure is firmly on Unai Emery after Arsenal dropped two points at home to Southampton on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Danny Ings gave Southampton the lead after eight minutes but Alexandre Lacazette equalised just ten minutes later.</p>
      <p>The Gunners fell behind again in the second half when James Ward-Prowse added a second for the visitors but there was a late reprieve for the home side.</p>
      <p>Lacazette bagged a 96th minute leveller as Arsenal snatched a point in the dying seconds of the contest.</p>
      <p>But it was not enough to arrest the club's winless run which has now stretched to five matches in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are now seventh in the top tier and eight points adrift of the Champions League places as the pressure continues to grow on Emery, with even former Arsenal star Tony Adams suggesting that the Spaniard's time is running out.</p>
      <p>But what are the options to replace Emery? <a href="https://www.sportnation.bet/sports/enhanced-odds/yournation/">SportNation</a> have run through the managers most likely to replace Emery and a certain former Tottenham boss in Mauricio Pochettino appears on the list.</p>
