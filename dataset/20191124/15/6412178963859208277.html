        <b><a href="https://www.football365.com/liverpool">Liverpool</a> star <a href="https://www.football365.com/tag/mo-salah">Mohamed Salah</a> is targeting a third consecutive African Player of the Year accolade after being named on the 30 player shortlist.</b>
      </p>
      <p>But Salah faces tough competition from his team-mate Sadio Mane and Arsenal forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for the trophy.</p>
      <p>The Egyptian scooped the award in 2017 and 2018, and has a good chance of completing a hat-trick after his 27 goals and 13 assists last season helped Liverpool win the Champions League.</p>
      <p>But Senegal international Mane and Gabon forward Aubameyang shared the Premier League Golden Boot award with Salah last season after scoring 22 league goals apiece.</p>

      <p>A host of other Premier League stars have been nominated by the African football confederation, including Riyad Mahrez, Wilfried Ndidi, Liverpool midfielder Naby Keita, Arsenalâ€™s Nicolas Pepe and Crystal Palace duo Wilfried Zaha and Jordan Ayew.</p>
      <p>Last year, Salah won the award ahead of Mane in second and Aubameyang in third, the same as in 2017.</p>
      <p>The winner will be crowned at the Citadel Azure in Hurghada, Egypt on January 7.</p>
