      <p>Goo Hara rose to fame as a member of the K-pop girl group Kara, who debuted in 2007 under DSP media, releasing hit singles such as Cupid and Step, before disbanding in 2016.</p>
      <p>She had recently signed with a Japanese production company and released a solo mini album, Midnight Queen, earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The news of her death comes after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/26/k-pop-star-goo-hara-safe-alleged-suicide-attempt-concerning-messages-9692746/">she had allegedly attempted to take her own life</a> after leaving a series of worrying messages on Instagram back in May.</p>
      <p>Hara’s manager subsequently called the 119 Rescue Center and she was then taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>She was also previously involved in a legal battle with her ex-boyfriend, Choi Jong Bum, who was indicated for allegedly threatening to release sex videos of the two.</p>
      <p>Bum later apologised for the controversy, saying in a statement posted to Instagram: ‘I want to sincerely apologise for causing so many people worry.</p>

      <p>‘All this time, I wasn’t able to respond to contacts from friends, acquaintances and people who cared for me because my KakaoTalk [social media app] account is gone.</p>
      <p>‘I apologise once again for making so many people worry for so long and for causing disappointment.’</p>
      <p>Goo Hara’s death also comes a month <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/14/k-pop-star-sulli-found-dead-aged-25-10913196/">after the suspected suicide of fellow K-pop star Sulli.</a> She was 25 years old.</p>
