      <h1>Thibaut Courtois offers Gareth Bale support after winger angered Real Madrid fans</h1>
      <h2>The £85m Galactico caused fury by posing with a flag claiming: “'Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order” on international duty</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:11:04+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:11</time> by <a rel="author">Neil McLeman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/neil-mcleman/</a></address>
      <p>Thibaut Courtois has told Gareth Bale to win back the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> fans after the Welshman was jeered on his return to club action.</p>
      <p>The £85m Galactico caused fury by posing with a flag claiming: “'Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order” on international duty.</p>
      <p>Head coach Zinedine Zidane had appealed to Los Blancos supporters not to target Bale but he was whistled as he came on as a second half sub for his first Real Madrid appearance since October 5.</p>
      <p>The Welshman helped to set up Luka Modric's third goal against Real Sociedad – and his team-mates showed their public backing by including Bale in the celebrations.</p>

      <p>After the 3-1 win, former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> keeper Courtois said: “We support him in the field, we have seen him well and now he has to win over people.”</p>
      <p>Federico Valverde added: “Celebrating the goal with him is a way to show that we are all united. He has treated me very well and deserves respect. Gareth is training very well and contributing. Keep it up and the fans will reward him.”</p>
      <p>A banner at the Bernebeu Stadium read: “Rodrygo – Vini – Lucas – Bale. In that order.“</p>
      <p>Head coach Zinedine Zidane said: "I hope this doesn't carry on for the rest of the season.</p>

      <p>"We want the fans to be with us from the beginning to the end, but we cannot control that.</p>
      <p>"The public has the right to do what they want, but I ask that they applaud everyone. I'm happy with the game and the victory and Bale came into the game well.</p>
      <p>"What you have to do is keep working on the pitch."</p>
      <p>Bale is now expected to retain his place in the squad for Tuesday's Champion's League clash with Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
