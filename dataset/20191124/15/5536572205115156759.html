      <p>Sometimes the King just has to let one go.</p>
      <p>That was the case recently when LeBron and fellow basketball star Chris Paul were leaving the Mohagany Prime Steakhouse in Oklahoma City when fans approached them while recording the entire time.</p>
      <p>Before entering a waiting SUV, James lifted his leg and let out a juicy fart.</p>
