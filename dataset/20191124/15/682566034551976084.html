      <p>Dubai -<b>Â </b><b>Jon Rahm</b> became the first Spaniard after the legendary Seve Ballesteros to become the European No 1 when he won the <b>DP World Tour Championship</b> and the <b>Race to Dubai</b> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>At the Earth course of Jumeirah Golf Estates, the 25-year-old started the day with five birdies in his first seven holes to pull clear of the field, then prevailed in a dramatic finish after he overcame a ferocious late charge by England's Tommy Fleetwood, who made five birdies in the last seven holes.</p>
      <p>Starting the final round tied for the lead with France's Mike Lorenzo-Vera at 15-under par, the world No.5 Rahm shot a 68 to finish on 19-under par. Fleetwood, who could have got the double himself with a win, closed with a seven-under par 65 which fell short by one shot.</p>
      <p>The win fetched him a cheque of $3 million, the biggest ever in the history of competitive golf, while the Race to Dubai win meant he also secured the $2 million from the Bonus Pool.</p>
      <p>"It's more of a reflection of a great year than just a good week," said Rahm, who is expected to climb to No3 in the world rankings when they come out on Monday.</p>
      <p>"Today, I feel like I've had two different days completely. Those first seven holes, I felt like I couldn't miss a shot.</p>
      <p>"Then just one errant tee shot and a three-putt, and everything took a turn for the worst.</p>
      <p>"After the bogey on the 15th, it made me kind of show some more determination and grit and heart just to win. In those last three holes, that was key."</p>
      <p>On becoming only the second Spaniard to be crowned European No1, Rahm said he was having trouble believing it.</p>
      <p>"I've thought about it all week. I've thought about it the last two hours. I've thought about it as soon as I made the putt. But it still hasn't processed in my mind," he added.</p>
      <p>"It's really so hard to believe that some of the greatest champions in European golf and Spanish golf haven't been able to accomplish what I have in just three years. That's what I can't really put my mind into.</p>
      <p>"So many great players throughout the history of Spain like Sergio (Garcia) and Ollie (Jose Maria Olazabal) have had a chance and they didn't get it done. It's just hard to put that in perspective to know that since Seve, I'm the next one to get it done.</p>
      <p>Fleetwood, who started the day four shots behind the leaders, was satisfied with his result.</p>
      <p>"I feel fine. Couldn't have done much more, really. You know, some of the shots they hit coming down the stretch, it started looking like I could get back in it or might have a chance," said the 28-year-old from Southport.</p>
      <p>"Proud of the way I played the last few holes. Proud of the end of the season, and these two weeks make the season just seem in a different light than it did would weeks before we started.</p>
      <p>"But fair play to Jon. That's a cracking birdie down the last when you have to make it. It's Jon's time, Jon's moment. I am just happy with my week."</p>
      <p>Lorenzo-Vera (70) had to be satisfied with a third-place finish at 271 and will have to wait for his first win on the European Tour. Northern Ireland's world No2 Rory McIlroy ended a disappointing day with a 73, but that was good enough for sole fourth place at 276.</p>
      <p>McIlroy's final round of the season may not have gone as per his expectation, but he was happy with the way he played through 2019, in which he won four times.</p>
      <p>"I'll look back at 2019 very fondly. There's been a lot of good golf played. Probably some of my most consistent golf - four wins and I guess this is my 19th top-10," said McIlroy.</p>
      <p>Scotland's Robert MacIntyre (69) won the Rookie of the Year title after he finished tied 14th at six-under par. His closest challenger, USA's Kurt Kitayama (73), was 48th in the 50-man field.</p>
