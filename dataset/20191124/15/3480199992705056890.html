      <p>Contactless pay-as-you-go ticketing will be extended to nearly 200 more train stations in south-east England under a Conservative government, the party has announced.</p>
      <p>The measure will mean that half of all train journeys in Britain and “almost all” London commuter routes can be completed using a bank card, according to the Tory manifesto.</p>
      <p>Most people travelling into the capital for work can already use contactless cards to pay for their travel.</p>
      <p>The system means passengers avoid having to queue at a ticket machine and are designed to ensure they are automatically charged the correct fare for their journey, including through daily and weekly price caps.</p>
      <p>Figures published last month by industry body the Rail Delivery Group showed that only half of train journeys are made using traditional paper tickets.</p>
      <p>Passengers bought orange tickets for just 50% of journeys in the four weeks from August 18, compared with 63% during the same period last year.</p>
      <p>The move towards smart ticketing – which includes contactless cards and smart cards such as London’s Oyster card – follows improvements in technology, the installation and upgrade of ticket barriers at stations and promotion of the system to passengers.</p>
      <p>The Department for Transport has previously insisted it has no plans to withdraw paper tickets but wants to encourage people to use smart tickets.</p>
      <p>The Tory manifesto also re-stated a series of other rail pledges, including:<br/>– Build Northern Powerhouse Rail between Leeds and Manchester<br/>– Overhaul the franchising model and give metro mayors control over services<br/>– Restore “many of the lines” axed in the 1960s during the Beeching cuts<br/>– To “consider the findings” of the Government-commissioned Oakervee Review into HS2</p>
      <p>The document stated that European cities are often more productive than those in the UK because they have better infrastructure.</p>
      <p>It added that a “transport revolution” is required to “level up” cities and regions.</p>
