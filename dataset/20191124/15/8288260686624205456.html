      <h2>Latest Birmingham City news | Blues had to settle for a point in their Sky Bet Championship clash against the Terriers</h2>

      <p>Birmingham City returned to Sky Bet Championship action on Saturday as they were held to a <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/proof-verdict-how-birmingham-city-17307487">1-1 draw with Huddersfield Town.</a></p>
      <p>Fraizer Campbell opened the scoring for the Terriers before Marc Roberts equalised for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues</a> to earn a point from their trip to the John Smith’s Stadium.</p>
      <p>Blues now lie in 15th place in the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/pep-clotet-press-conference-every-17306823">Championship table</a> going into Wednesday night’s trip to face Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough.</p>
      <p>We at <i>Birmingham Live</i> extensively covered Blues’ stalemate with the Terriers, but what about the opposition camp? <br/><br/>Here is how the opposition covered Saturday’s match.</p>

      <p>Huddersfield Town returned to Sky Bet Championship action following the November international break with a 1-1 draw against Birmingham City.</p>
      <p>Fraizer Campbell had put Town ahead 10 minutes into the second-half but a late Marc Roberts equaliser ensured that the points were shared at the John Smith’s Stadium.</p>
      <p>Alex Pritchard made his first start under the Cowleys as one of four changes to the starting XI that lost at Preston a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>Jon Gorenc Stanković, Jonathan Hogg and Fraizer Campbell also came into the side alongside Pritch, who was making his 200th career appearance in all competitions.</p>
      <p>The visitors switched the sides around at kick-off, so Town were attacking the Fantastic Media Stand in the first-half. It didn’t disrupt the Terriers rhythm early on however, as they worked the first real opportunity of the game when Elias Kachunga fired over after intercepting a loose Birmingham pass.</p>
      <p>Both sides continued to battle in the opening exchanges of the first-half before the Blues created their first real chance of the game, as Jude Bellingham manoeuvred his way into the box before firing a strike over whilst off balance.</p>
      <p>That opportunity seemed to be the spark the game needed, as Town immediately drove down the other end to create the game’s closest chance yet. Karlan Grant’s fizzed ball across the box found the run of Alex Pritchard who saw his goal-bound effort blocked on the slide.</p>
      <p>Town nearly went one better on 36 minutes however, as Juninho Bacuna’s teasing cross found the unmarked Elias Kachunga in the box who produced a stunning save from Birmingham ‘keeper Connall Trueman at point blank range, before Marc Roberts blocked Fraizer Campbell’s rebound.</p>
      <p>Bacca was one of five of Town’s First Team players that went away with their national sides over the break, having featured for Curaçao, but he continued to looked fresh at both ends of the pitch.</p>

      <p>Moments after his cross nearly broke the deadlock, a vital header at the back post kept the score at 0-0 on the stroke of half-time.</p>
      <p>The clearance allowed Town to break on the counter and force a foul, but despite Alex Pritchard’s low-driven free-kick stinging the hands of the Birmingham ‘keeper, the two sides went into the break level at the John Smith’s Stadium.</p>
      <p>Town continued to press for the opener straight after the half time and had their reward 10 minutes after the interval. An inch-perfect ball from Trevoh Chalobah found the run of Fraizer Campbell, with the striker maintaining his composure on the run to slot the ball past the ‘keeper and give Town the lead.</p>
      <p>The Terriers continued to assert their dominance on the encounter and nearly had a second soon after. Elias Kachunga found himself unmarked inside the box once again but couldn’t divert Alex Pritchard’s cross from the left past the goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>For all of Town’s efforts, the Blues drew level on 78 minutes. A well-worked free-kick was nodded in by Marc Roberts amongst a melee of players inside the box.</p>
      <p>Danny Cowley’s side pushed forward in search of a winner in the final 10 minutes but couldn’t create any clear-cut chances to win the game, with the visitors holding firm to ensure that they would take a point from their trip to West Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>Next up for Town is the second of two Sky Bet Championship home games in the space of four days with Swansea City the visitors to the John Smith’s Stadium on Tuesday 26 November 2019; 7.45pm kick-off.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Kamil Grabara 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Did his calling and collecting work well and commanded the box soundly. Made a great late block to keep Town level. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Juninho Bacuna 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Slotted in at right-back after deputising there for injured Danny Simpson at Preston. Made a great clearing header. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Jon Gorenc Stankovic 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Making a first league start of the season and, barring an odd blip, did well alongside Schindler. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Christopher Schindler 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Excellent covering work and tackling and always seemed to be in the right position. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Lewis O'Brien 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Played at left-back in a formational re-jig to 4-2-3-1. Still managed to push forward with promise at times. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Trevoh Chalobah 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Some promising early breaks. Played the pass of the game to set up Campbell's goal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jonathan Hogg 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Back after a one-match ban and booked inside 10 minutes. Fought hard throughout.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Elias Kachunga 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Made some promising first-half runs and worked hard. Unlucky not to score with a 35th-mintue header.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alex Pritchard 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Played some lovely passes and caused Birmingham plenty of problems. Close with a long-range free-kick. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Karlan Grant 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dangerous raiding from the left and put in a couple of very decent crosses. Had one shot saved. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Fraizer Campbell 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Very lively and determined on his return to the side. Great run and finish for the goal - richly deserved. </p>

      <p>“I’m disappointed for the players really because I thought they put a lot into it. The resilience, the determination and the fight were really good,” said Danny.</p>
      <p>“Proud of the players’ application. Proud of the players’ effort. We’ve got boys playing out of position, we had Lewis (O’Brien) playing left-back, Juninho (Bacuna) at right-back; I thought those two did great.</p>
      <p>“We have to go back, and we have to work again. But I can rest easy tonight knowing the players fought really hard for one another in what was really difficult circumstances.”</p>
      <p>“It was a brilliant pass, a pass good enough to win any football match and a great finish for Fraizer. It was a really well-worked goal.</p>
      <p>“We’re disappointed today because we gave very little chances away, except for one soft one in the 80th minute, yet we created quite a lot of good chances today.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t going to be perfect with so much going against us in the week, so the fact we had all those qualities leaves me pleased about that.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been a manager 13 years, near on 800 games, and that’s definitely the most difficult team I’ve had to select. It’s not straight-forward at the moment, we’ve got an unbalanced squad.</p>
      <p>“We spoke to Lewis in Dubai and we’ve done a lot of work with him this week. Lewis will play anywhere for the team and do his very best.</p>
      <p>“We watched Bacca’s games, we watch him against Wolves last year and the next game against Brighton. Fair play to Juninho because he’d been doing very well in centre midfield but when we spoke to him, he was willing to put the team first. We were proud of both of them today.”</p>
