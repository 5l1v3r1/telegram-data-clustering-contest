        <b>A DOMESTIC abuse victim has spoken of her joy after the "controlling" ex accused of stripping her naked and battering her was finally snared for abuse after their "living nightmare" relationship ended.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Maureen Spratt claimed Kevin Shopp stripped her naked and battered her in her home in Erskine, near Glasgow.</p>

      <p>He denied the attack and went on trial over the assault claims, forcing her to give evidence against him earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Shopp, 37, had his lawyer accused Miss Spratt, 39, of faking pregnancies in a bid to keep him in a relationship with her.</p>
      <p>She denied the claims, insisting she was the victim of violent domestic abuse.</p>
      <p>And he was cleared of the claims - only to then land back in court for abusing Miss Spratt.</p>

      <p>He broke bail conditions by approaching her in Barshaw Park, Paisley, on April 21 this year, and behaved in a threatening or abusive way towards her by hurling insults and threats towards her.</p>
      <p>Shopp, of Erskine, landed back in the dock at Paisley Sheriff Court on Friday to be sentenced for breaking his bail conditions and hounding her in the park.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Sukhwinder Gill fined him £1,000 and made him the subject of a 12-month Non-Harassment Order - which sees him banned from approaching or contacting Miss Spratt in any way.</p>
      <p>The pretty mother-of-two said afterwards: "It was awful with him.</p>
      <p>"He constantly accused me of cheating, regularly checking my phone.</p>
      <p>"He needed to see my emails, my Facebook, he knew all my passwords and he still couldn't accept it.</p>
      <p>"In his head he has issues.</p>
      <p>"He wouldn't let me go anywhere without him.</p>
      <p>"It was a living nightmare - his jealousy was too much.</p>
      <p>"It was like walking on eggshells, he would just kick off and constantly accuse me of cheating.</p>
      <p>"He would then apologise, saying he was lucky to be with me, but that wouldn't last long and he would start it all again."</p>
      <p>And Miss Spratt said Shopp's abuse continued even after their split.</p>
      <p>She explained: "It was awful. It didn't matter what I did or said, he wouldn't stop.</p>
      <p>"Even after I ended it he continued to breach his bail and continued to watch me and contact me.</p>
      <p>"Even in front of my children, he shouted abuse at me - it was terrifying.</p>
      <p>"I can only thank the local police and Women's Aid for all their help and support.</p>
      <p>"No means no and no one should be living in fear, it's not right.</p>
      <p>"I'm so glad justice has been served and no one should be put through what I have been.</p>
      <p>"Domestic abuse is unacceptable on all levels."</p>
      <p>Shopp had been accused of attacking Spratt at her home in Erskine, on April 21, 2018.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claimed he behaved in a threatening or abusive way towards her by shouting and swearing at her, and assaulted her by grabbing her by the body, tearing off her clothes, dragging her by the body, ripping off her underwear, pushing her in to a shower and punching her on the body.</p>
      <p>But, following a trial, Sheriff David Pender found those allegations not proven.</p>
