      <h1>The heartwarming moment Cardiff Met FC manager's son takes team talk after dad suffers suspected heart attack</h1>
      <h2>Isaac Edwards took the post-match team talk in the absence of his father following Cardiff Met's win over Cefn Druids</h2>

      <p>It was a team talk his dad would certainly have been proud of.</p>
      <p>Isaac Edwards, son of Cardiff Met FC boss Christian who suffered a suspected heart attack last Thursday, sat his father's players down in the changing room and read them the riot act following their 2-1 win over Cefn Druids.</p>
      <p>It was a win, but by the narrowest of margins, too narrow for Isaac, who did not need a second invitation to perform the post-match analysis to his team.</p>
      <p>Equipped with a whiteboard laden with tactics and magnets, Isaac slapped the board with his hand and exclaimed: "It's not good enough!"</p>
      <p>It prompted the players and stuff to burst into hysterics as the board came crashing down to the ground in the most heartwarming of videos from the Welsh Premier League side.</p>
      <p>It was a touching and sincere moment at the end of what has been a traumatic and difficult week for the club.</p>

      <p>They had to earn that win in the absence of their manager Edwards, of course, who was admitted to hospital after a suspected cardiac arrest during training on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>In a statement released by the club on Friday, former Wales and Swansea City defender Edwards was said to be "okay" and under observation.</p>
      <p>"Cardiff Met FC are sending our best wishes to our manager Christian who last night suffered a suspected heart attack at training," the statement read.</p>
      <p>"We can confirm he is okay and under observation. We would like to thank you for your kind words and messages."</p>
      <p>A host of rival teams subsequently sent their best wishes to Edwards, who has done a remarkable job with the university side.

      <p>The ex-Swansea, Nottingham Forest and Bristol Rovers centre back's side became the first British University menâ€™s team to play in European competition this summer when they made the preliminary round of the Europa League.</p>
      <p>Aberystwyth Town tweeted their support, saying: "Aberystwyth Town Football Club extends its best wishes to Christian and hope for a speedy recovery.</p>
      <p>"If we can do anything to help please do let us know, including for those who were in training with Christian at the time."</p>
