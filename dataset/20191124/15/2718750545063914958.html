      <h1>Just the Baby Yoda Parts of <i>The Mandalorian</i></h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Kathryn VanArendonk, Jen Chaney, Jackson McHenry</a></address>
      <p>Once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away, Disney made a new streaming service called <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/disney-plus-movies-shows-include-deals-cost.html">Disney+</a>. In order to get everyone interested in Disney+, it made a new <i>Star Wars</i> TV show called <a href="https://www.vulture.com/tv/the-mandalorian/"><i>The Mandalorian</i></a>, featuring an unbearably adorable creature who does not yet have a name but whom everyone immediately called <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/the-mandalorian-baby-yoda-the-force.html">Baby Yoda</a>.</p>
      <p>The people embraced Baby Yoda, who was sweet and good and very tiny. But then Disney decided that GIFs of this beautiful being should be <a href="https://twitter.com/kvanaren/status/1197548426726137856">removed from the internet!</a> In spite of this obstacle, a dedicated band of fans on the forest moon of Vulture joined forces with ace illustrator <a href="http://www.ohmgee.com/">Martin Gee</a>, intent on spreading the good news of Baby Yoda. So with no further ado, here is the story of the cutest li’l green baby to grace the galaxy in eons.</p>
