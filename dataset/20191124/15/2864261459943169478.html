      <h2>This is the fourth E. coli outbreak linked to romaine lettuce in the last two years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T15:50:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 15:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.bashawstar.com/author/canadian-press-2/" target="_blank">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>Canadian health officials are warning consumers to avoid romaine lettuce grown in Salinas, Calif., because of another food poisoning outbreak.</p>
      <p>The notice comes almost exactly one year after a similar outbreak led to a blanket warning about romaine, ranging from whole heads to pre-cut salad mixes.</p>
      <p>The Public Health Agency of Canada says one patient in Manitoba last month suffered from an illness bearing a “similar genetic fingerprint” to illnesses reported in an ongoing U.S. investigation into an outbreak of E. coli in the Golden State.</p>
      <p>Health officials say an outbreak is not occurring in Canada, but romaine from northern California is imported north of the border this time of the year.</p>
      <p>The agency says it is implementing “new actions” at the border to prevent the tainted lettuce from coming into Canada.</p>
      <p>Leafy greens can become contaminated after contact with feces from infected animals via soil, water or improperly composted manure.</p>
      <p>This is the fourth E. coli outbreak linked to romaine lettuce affecting Canadian consumers in the last two years.</p>
