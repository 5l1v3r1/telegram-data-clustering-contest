      <p>Fancy a luxury break? It doesn’t get much more luxurious than a whole Champagne bar to yourself.</p>
      <p>This converted 15th-century watermill has its own Champagne bar and hot tub.</p>
      <p>And with 16 rooms, it is the perfect place to stay for a big group trip.</p>
      <p>The property was transformed by Sandy Potter, 53, who started property development after her divorce to support her daughters.</p>
      <p>The holiday let is in the Peak District countryside and there are an amazing seven bedrooms.</p>
      <p>The Grade II listed property features in the Domesday Book and was used to mill corn and wheat until about 1960.</p>
      <p>Sandy and her second husband David Potter, 47, have restored its 300-year-old water wheel, and it retains its ancient stonework and oak beams.</p>

      <p>They bought the property for £650,000 in February and have spent £100,000 renovating it, with the work taking two months.</p>
      <p>Sandy said: ‘We feel so lucky to custodians of such a special house with amazing history.</p>
      <p>‘When we bought it the water wheel was rotting away and trying to find an engineer to fix it was quite a challenge.</p>

      <p>‘All the bits had to be hand made so it was a costly process but it is now once again the biggest working wheel in the Peak District.</p>
      <p>‘We’ve tried to make the property a mixture of the new and old, adding the Champagne bar and contemporary furniture to go with the traditional features. We’re very proud of it.’</p>
      <p>Sandy started her business after she divorced her husband 20 years ago, creating a bed and breakfast. At the time, daughter Sophie was seven and her second little girl Maria just four years old.</p>

      <p>Sandy has since renovated a string of properties into successful holiday lets in the county, with this one her most ambitious project yet.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘After my divorce, suddenly I had no pension fund or future security, in fact, I had no means whatsoever.</p>
      <p>‘Pensions and support with care costs were issues constantly on my mind.</p>

      <p>‘My primary reason for setting up a holiday let was to not only provide an income for the short term but to future-proof my pension and care costs so that my daughters didn’t have to worry about this either.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Holiday-lets were the best solution for me and eventually, it became clear that they would provide more income than from a buy-to-let.</p>
      <p>‘Having this ‘nest egg’ that would ‘keep on giving’ alleviate my concerns about the future for my family.</p>

      <p>‘When I’m ready to retire, my children will be hands-on and run the properties and take over the business, so there is a job for them, and an income for me too.’</p>
      <p>Sarah Derbyshire, business development manager at Cottages.com, said: “Not only has Sandy transformed this historic property into an inspiring retreat but it’s clear her attention to detail is paying dividends in her overall success.</p>
      <p>“The passion and dedication from Sandy and her family make it a truly beautiful place to stay and I have no doubt she will continue to thrive.”</p>
      <p>The Water Mill is available as a holiday-let on Cottages.com from £1,586 for a four-night break.</p>
