      <p>BALLYBODEN ST ENDA’S booked their place in the Leinster final, following an 11 point victory over Garrycastle, in what was a one sided game of football in TEG Cusack Park.</p>
      <p>The moment of this match arrived in the 50th minute, when Mickey Greene replaced Dessie Dolan and the latter received a standing ovation which befitted his status, as virtually everyone in the stadium stood up to applaud.</p>
      <p>Dolan announced his retirement after the Westmeath county final and the Garrycastle contingent took one final opportunity to pay tribute to their best ever footballer.</p>
      <p>It was a point from Dolan which opened the scoring, before Colm Basquel’s effort levelled the tie.</p>
      <p>The first goal of the game came in the sixth minute, courtesy of Robbie McDaid, who finished to the net at the end of an excellent solo run.</p>
      <p>Ballyboden then registered the next four points in succession to stretch their lead to seven, though Garrycastle responded with scores from Dessie Dolan and Eoin Monaghan.</p>
      <p>Ballyboden responded with the next three points and it was tit for tat until the interval, with the Dublin side holding a 1-10 to 0-5 lead at the break.</p>
      <p>Garrycastle scored the first three points of the second half courtesy of Dessie Dolan, with Ros McGarry opening his sides second half account with a 35th minute point.</p>
      <p>Dessie Dolan responded with a free for Garrycastle, though that was as good as it got for the Westmeath side and the games key score may have been Colm Basquel’s 53rd minute goal, which left nine points between the teams.</p>
      <p>James Holland added another major in the 57th minute, though the outcome of the game was long decided at that stage.</p>
      <p>Ballyboden held out for an 11-point win and will now face Eire Og in the Leinster final, while Garrycastle must plan for 2020 without the best player they have ever produced.</p>
