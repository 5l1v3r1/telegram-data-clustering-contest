      <p>The iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro are premium smartphones in nature, priced above $999 and $1,099 respectively, it’s not a surprise to hear that 91% of Porsche owners in the US are also iPhone owners. We all know, how Apple has a strong “local” advantage over the competition. The confirmation came directly from Klaus Zellmer, the President, and CEO of Porsche North America. He made this revelation during  Automobility LA 2019. But this isn’t everything.</p>
      <p>In another video posted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=28&amp;v=ihP6_zIjcZo&amp;feature=emb_logo">9to5Mac</a>, Zellmer stated that around 80% of Porsche owners are also iPhone owners in China. However, this perspective should suffer a strong change in the next year. According to the CEO, around 40% of them said that their next smartphones will be powered by Android. Apparently, this sudden change has to do with the arrival of 5G. Currently, Apple doesn’t have any offer in the market with support for the next-gen connectivity. When it comes to Android smartphones, there are plenty of offers from different brands in China.</p>

      <p>According to reports, Apple will finally jump in the 5G era with the 2020 iPhones. However, they won’t come before September next year. Therefore, users who are eagerly waiting for 5G can’t wait several months just to keep their loyalty with Apple. Another possible reason has to do with the advent of foldable smartphones. The Chinese market is booming with offers such as Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, W20 5G, and Huawei’s Mate X. Those are premium smartphones, and while you doesn’t necessarily need to have a Porsche to buy any of these, it surely helps.</p>
      <h3>The Patriotism that made Apple powerful in the US, is making Huawei a Behemoth in China.</h3>
      <p>Another reason is the amazing patriotism we are seeing among Chinese customers. It was intensified by Trump’s government efforts to put Huawei out of business with the ban and all the sanctions against the Chinese firm. Despite this, Huawei got 42% of the Chinese market share during Q3 2019. The Chinese Behemoth saw its shipments in China soar 66% year-over-year, while deliveries of iPhone units in the same country declined 28% from July through September.</p>

      <p>Zellmer states that his company has worked a lot to bring full compatibility with iOS. And that makes perfect sense in the US market. However, with the sudden shift in China, the company will have to offer a lot more for the Android side of the coin.</p>
