      <p>The girl, according to reports, would sleep with at least 10 meen in a day, and sometimes she would spent a night at a client’s home.</p>
      <p>A car belonging to the owner of the brothel would be used as a taxi to transport the girls to clients’ homes.</p>
      <p>The officers recovered sex toys imported illegally into the country and for use in the sex parties by minors.</p>
      <p>It is reported that another group of 20 girls had been relocated from the house to a brothel in Mombasa.</p>
      <p>The offenders were charged in court but denied the charges, and were released on a Ksh1 million bail.</p>
