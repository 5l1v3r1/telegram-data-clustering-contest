      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/jadon-sancho">Jadon Sancho </a>is not feeling comfortable in his shoes at <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/borussia-dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>. After the treatment he received during the recent Bundesliga game against Bayern Munich, Sancho is feeling 'humiliated and scapegoated' according to sources from the Athletic. The <a href="https://theathletic.com/1403402/2019/11/24/exclusive-jadon-sancho-feels-humiliated-and-scapegoated-by-dortmund-amid-interest-from-barcelona-liverpool-united-and-real">report</a> says that his early substitution in the game was the major factor.</p>
      <p>Sancho was taken off after half an hour in the game when Dortmund were trailing 3-0. Bayern won the game 4-0, and Dortmund are now five points off the pace in the league. Coach Lucian Favre admitted later that the England international was taken off because he was 'not good enough'. But Sancho is key to their title hopes, which he proved against Paderborn on Friday.</p>
      <p>Trailing 3-0 again, Sancho had a goal and assist as Dortmund clawed back to rescue a point. Numerous clubs have an interest in the youngster, which include Barcelona, Real Madrid, Liverpool, and Manchester United.</p>
      <p>In 17 appearances this season, Sancho has five goals and nine assists to his name. He is still 19 years of age, and will demand a hefty price tag. If Dortmund don't do their best to satisfy their start, he could well be off to one of the big clubs in the summer - if not in January.</p>
