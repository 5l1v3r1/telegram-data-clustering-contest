      <h1>The 46,000 people in Liverpool who could change the election</h1>
      <h2>Students could be caught out by term dates, but this is how they can make their vote count</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:09:03+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:09</time> by <a rel="author">Julia Rampen</a></address>
      <p>When students arrive in Liverpool at the start of term, everyone notices, from <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/spent-afternoon-following-deliveroo-cyclists-17269121">Deliveroo couriers</a> to taxi drivers.</p>
      <p>But there’s one moment when they could suddenly vanish - <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/general-election">the general election of 2019.</a></p>
      <p>There are more than 46,000 UK students in Liverpool <a href="https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/11-01-2018/sfr247-higher-education-student-statistics/location">according to government figures</a> (there are more students in total but not all can vote). That’s one in ten people in Liverpool as a whole.</p>
      <p>And most live in just two constituencies - Liverpool Riverside, and Liverpool Wavertree.</p>
      <p>If students voted as a group, they could have the power to kick out one MP and elect another, as they have in other university towns around the country.</p>
      <p>But it’s also very unusual for an election to happen in winter, and some fear that this could mean students don't end up voting at all.</p>
      <h4>How students could change Liverpool's politics</h4>

      <p>Nick Hillman, from higher education thinktank HEPI, told the ECHO: “For the student vote to count you need to have lots of ducks in a row.”</p>
      <p>First, students need to have registered to vote (the deadline is midnight on November 26). This isn't straightforward - the date falls right across the end of university terms. Students have the option to vote in their hometown or university address, but some fear they may end up doing neither.</p>
      <p>Second, they need to actually turn up and vote on the day. And thirdly, they are going to have to vote in the same way, and in big enough numbers to overturn any existing majority.</p>
      <p>Most students live in Liverpool Riverside, which covers the city centre, and has traditionally been Labour. Students are stereotypically a left-wing bunch, so it’s easy to assume that even if they do vote, it’ll just mean a bigger majority for Labour.</p>
      <p>But according to Mr Hillman, the picture is more complicated.</p>
      <p>He said: “The student vote is much more volatile than people think. People assume students are left-wing, [and] they must vote Labour but the student vote is there to be moved.”</p>
      <h4>What students care about</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Another stereotype is that students will vote based on a party’s record on tuition fees - but Mr Hillman points out that many of the students of today were barely at high school when the Lib Dems and Tories hiked tuition fees.</p>
      <p>Mr Hillman said: “In general Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party are much less popular among students than they were.</p>
      <p>“They are still by far and away the most popular party among students, but a couple of years ago Mr Corbyn and Labour were polling around 70% among students and they are now around 40%.</p>
      <p>“The Lib Dems have recovered a bit.”</p>
      <p>Students do care about Brexit, Mr Hillman said, but most were too young to vote in the 2016 EU referendum.</p>
      <p>He said: “A general election is almost a proxy referendum for them so it is really important to them.”</p>
      <h4>‘I haven’t heard anyone mention student fees’</h4>

      <p>On a wet afternoon in the University of Liverpool’s Abercromby Square, few students that the ECHO spoke to seemed decided about their vote, mentioning the Lib Dems, Labour and Greens.</p>
      <p>Some were planning to vote in their hometowns where they had a better chance of making an impact, but one joked their main political priority was “writing my dissertation”.</p>
      <p>Miranda Pudney, 18, was yet to register to vote and said she had “no idea” who to vote for.</p>
      <p>She said: “The environment should be the priority, not necessarily Brexit - it has dragged on a bit.”</p>
      <p>Hannah Berry, 28, an English lecturer and a Labour supporter herself, said students seemed less enthusiastic about the party.</p>
      <p>She told the ECHO: “Before, the students seemed to be very open and very vocal about supporting Labour and now it seems to have muted.”</p>
      <p>Like Mr Hillman, she said Brexit was a big talking point on campus, but added: “It is very divided.”</p>
      <p>She said: “I haven’t heard anyone mention student fees which is surprising. Austerity comes up, and jobs and employment.”</p>

      <h4>Register to vote</h4>
      <p>Time is running out to register to vote in the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a> on December 12.</p>
      <p>Applications must be submitted by 11.59pm on Tuesday November 26.</p>
      <p>To be able to vote a person must be registered to vote, aged 18 or over on polling day, and also be either a UK or Irish citizen or a qualifying Commonwealth citizen resident in the UK.</p>
      <p>Applications to register to vote can be made online at <a href="http://gov.uk/register-to-vote">gov.uk/register-to-vote</a> .</p>
      <p>If you want to vote by post (i.e. if you're a student who wants to vote in your hometown), you need to return <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/711954/Apply-to-vote-by-post-England-Scotland-and-Wales__1_.pdf">your application form</a> 11 working days  before the poll.</p>
      <h4>Check term dates</h4>
      <p>Unless you have a postal vote, you need to vote in person at a polling station, so where you'll actually be on 12 December 2019.</p>
      <p>Liverpool Hope Students' Union President Haris Rashid said: “Within the Student Union we are encouraging as many people as possible to vote because every vote really does count.</p>
      <p>"We are trying to get that message across. Most people are taking it on board and have already said they have done it. We are making people aware that they could vote at their home address.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool University's term ends on Friday 13 December.</p>
      <p>Liverpool John Moores' term ends on Friday 13 December.</p>
      <p>Liverpool Hope University's term ends on Friday 20 December.</p>
