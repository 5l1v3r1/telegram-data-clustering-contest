      <p>Jimmy Garoppolo wants 49ers fans to “rock” the house on Sunday night when San Francisco face their toughest challenge of the season.</p>
      <p>The San Francisco quarterback has supporters dreaming of a first Super Bowl crown in a quarter of a century, having led the team to nine wins in the first 10 games of the season.</p>
      <p>They have not had a winning record in the five seasons since they moved into Levi’s Stadium and prior to this season, fans have been less than enthusiastic.</p>
      <p>But on Sunday night, they welcome the Green Bay Packers to northern California (Sky Sports Action, 1.20am), with the 49ers flying high and with a chance to make a statement against Aaron Rodgers’ side.</p>

      <p>A win would not only see them maintain the best record in the NFL but would give them a two-game lead over Green Bay and the tie-breaker when it comes to deciding home field advantage in the playoffs.</p>
      <p>Garoppolo said: “Levi’s has been rocking. It’s been a real blessing for us to have fans like that.</p>
      <p>“It’s awesome to have a crowd like that. It makes it hard for their offence, great for our defence. Just getting the place rocking will be huge. The louder they can be, the better.</p>

      <p>“It will be a big game. This is a great opportunity and a great challenge for us. Sunday will be a big one.”</p>
      <p>But Garoppolo knows it will take more than just noise to overcome the highly-fancied Packers.</p>
      <p>“Green Bay’s defence is fast and they are pretty talented right across the board. There’s really no weak links, they will make you earn everything all the way down the field.”</p>
