      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida">Florida</a> man was arrested after he allegedly spit food into a woman's mouth in a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/odd-news">bizarre road rage incident</a> last month, police said.</p>
      <p>David Wipperman, 61, was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">taken into custody</a> Thursday in connection with the incident on Oct. 29, when Wipperman <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/auto">got out of his truck</a> and approached a woman driving nearby just before 6 p.m.</p>

      <p>It's unclear where the two were during the encounter, but Wipperman walked up to the woman, and she rolled down the window of her sedan to apologize, <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/bizarre/2019/11/22/pinellas-man-charged-with-spitting-food-in-womans-mouth-after-road-rage/">according to the Tampa Bay Times</a>. That's when, authorities say, the man <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/food">spit the food he was chewing</a> at her.</p>
