      <p>In last night's show rugby legend <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-james-haskell-made-the-first-camp-leader/">James Haskell was voted camp leader</a> and Jacqueline as his deputy, but during a chat with the pair, Andrew let out his emotions.</p>
      <p>He told Jacqueline: "I honestly thought that I was gonna walk out, but I haven’t, when you’re tired, you just say 'have I done the right thing'."</p>
      <p>Jacqueline said: "You'd never leave, I can tell that, you’re just tired."</p>
      <aside>Everyone has a bad day. You’re an important part of the group and we need you.</aside>
      <p>James chipped in by saying: "Everyone has a bad day. You’re an important part of the group and we need you."</p>
      <p>"He’s been sleeping on the floor, he’s had six nights on the floor," Jacqueline added.</p>

      <p>Andrew, 44, admitted later in the Bush Telegraph room: "I was up in the Leaders Cabin, I was chatting to James and Jacqueline and I was just so tired, I just hit a wall."</p>
      <p>"I’m just so tired," he continued.</p>
      <p>"It's one of those things that when you're tired, you get down, and then thoughts that you wouldn't care about normally get into your head."</p>

      <p>At the end of the episode, Jacqueline also broke down when she discovered that she had been voted to do yet another trial by viewers.</p>
      <p>She and fellow campmate Ian Wright will take on the Crevice of Cruelty.</p>
      <p>The grim trial will see the pair in an underground cavern, where they have to unlock stars while facing creepy crawlies and reptiles.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to do any more, man," wept the 27-year-old.</p>
