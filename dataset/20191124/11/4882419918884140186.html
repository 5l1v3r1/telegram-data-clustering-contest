      <h1>Spurs coach Mourinho wants to know what's going on in Eriksen's mind</h1>
      <h2>The new Tottenham coach left the Dane on the bench in his first game in charge</h2>

      <p>Jose Mourinho left midfielder Christian Eriksen on the bench for his first game in charge of Tottenham and says he needs to know what's in the Danish international's mind.</p>
      <p>Eriksen is out of contract in the summer and has made it clear in the past that he would like to leave. Real Madrid have been strongly linked with him.</p>
      <p>Mourinho, who replaced Mauricio Pochettino in the week, didn't pick Eriksen for Saturday's 3-2 win over West Ham, although he did bring him on the 79th minute.</p>
      <p>"The match today is very, very important but our future is also very important," Mourinho told BT Sport when asked about Eriksen before the game at the London Stadium. "I need to understand really what is in Christian's mind or heart and we have to make the right decision for the club."</p>
      <p>Eriksen has been one of Tottenham's best players in recent seasons but is experiencing a strange campaign. His doubts about renewing have seen him reduced to a secondary role and his performances have been questioned when he has played.</p>
