      <h1>Mark Wright looks overwhelmed with emotion as he gazes at Megan McKenna singing</h1>
      <h2>The former The Only Way Is Essex star was mesmerised as he watched Megan performing on stage on Saturday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:05:23+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:05</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror .co.uk</a></address>
      <p>Mark Wright looked close to tears as he gazed upon Megan McKenna as she warbled away on The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> : Celebrity on Saturday night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mark-wright">The 32-year-old reality star</a> was a surprise guest in the audience of the long running ITV singing contest where he was reunited with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/megan-mckenna">his former TOWIE co-star Megs, 27.</a></p>
      <p>Sitting in the audience, Mark looked close to tears as he watched Megan sing a rendition of Roxette’s 1987 classic power ballad, It Must Have Been Love.</p>
      <p>Teary eyed Mark gazed upon reality beauty Megan as she sang like an angel while dressed like a vision in red, wearing a strapless red dress with a revealing slit running up the front of her left leg.</p>

      <p>As she neared the chorus of the iconic song, cameras cut to show Mark absolutely lost in the performance as he gazed at her before breaking into a smile.</p>
      <p>The performance won the full support of Mark, who gushed about her to X Factor host Dermot O’Leary after she performed.</p>
      <p>“Megan’s an Essex girl. She’s repping Essex,” the star - who appeared on the show without soap star wife Michelle Keegan, 32.</p>

      <p>Mark even backed Megan to win, adding: “I think, with what just happened, it’s got to be Megan. She is phenomenal.”</p>
      <p>It’s not the first time Mark has crossed paths with Megan, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/mark-wright-flirts-megan-mckenna-10068663">having made a cringe attempt at flirting with the dark haired beauty way back in 2010</a> when they both featured on The Only Way Is Essex.</p>
      <p>Mark desperately asked her: “Do you have a boyfriend?” long before he began dating <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> star Michelle - with whom he has been blissfully married since 2015.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, there was embarrassment for Mark following his appearance in the X Factor audience as Simon Cowell’s girlfriend Lauren Silverman <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/simon-cowells-girlfriend-appears-ask-20948127">appeared to ask who he was.</a></p>
      <p>As Dermot sat beside Mark to ask him for opinions, Lauren could be seen shooting him quizzical looks.</p>
      <p>"Did Simons partner just ask who @MarkWright_ was live on tv directly in front on the camera?!?!? Love the lady answering clarified he was on Towie,” one fan asked on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> .</p>
