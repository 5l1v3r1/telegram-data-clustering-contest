        <b>National heart-throb Daniel O'Donnell has claimed he is ready to have an affair...on Coronation Street.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Donegal native spoke of his love for the British soap opera, his favourite show, and that he would love a cameo appearance.</p>
      <p>However, a simple walk-on part or showing up in the background wouldn't be enough for the singer.</p>
      <p>"I'd love an affair," he joked. "I could have had an affair with Mavis (Rita’s famously dithery sidekick), but Mavis has been gone for ages.</p>
      <p>"Mary might be the only one left for me now, so maybe me and Mary in her campervan!</p>
      <p>"I could be the mechanic! I’d love a cameo – I’d sweep the streets, anything. It’s a great programme."</p>

      <p>O'Donnell also gave an insight to the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/showbiz/celebrity-news/irish-legend-daniel-odonnell-says-20941758">Irish Daily Mirror</a> into what his life is like outside of work, saying that he enjoys playing cards in his local town hall.</p>
      <p>"Everybody knows me, this is where I was born and grew up. I’ve gone for the past 50 years.</p>
      <p>"I love playing cards and we have great fun – we don’t take it seriously and we’re always laughing.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes you can win a fiver or a tenner. We pay 5 Euros to go in and then the top prize is 15 Euros."</p>
