      <p>A 53-year-old woman has been killed in a hit-and-run outside a hospital in what police are calling an "awful incident".</p>
      <p>Police were called to Wigan Lane, outside of the Royal Albert Infirmary, in Wigan, at about 8.50pm on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Paramedics battled to save the woman but she died at the scene.</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made and the car failed to stop.</p>
      <p>Police Sergeant Andrew Page, of GMP’s Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said the force is doing "all we can" to trace the driver.</p>
      <p>He said: "A woman has tragically lost her life and we are doing all we can to support her family who are understandably devastated by what happened.</p>
      <p>“The vehicle failed to stop at the scene and had left the immediate area prior to police arrival but we’re doing all we can trace the person responsible for this awful incident.</p>
      <p>“If you have any information or saw anyone acting suspiciously in the local area last night, please get in touch as soon as possible so we can provide the woman’s family with the answers they deserve.”</p>
      <p>The car has been described as a dark-coloured vehicle.</p>
