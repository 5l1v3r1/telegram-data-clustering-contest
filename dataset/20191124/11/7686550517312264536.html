      <h1>Very real dangers of lack of sleep explained by scientists</h1>

      <p>Someone who is sleep-deprived is three times more likely to make potentially deadly lapses in concentration, a new study has found.</p>
      <p>In one of the largest sleep studies of its kind, researchers from Michigan State University set out to quantify the effect that the lack of sleep has on a person's ability to follow a procedure and maintain attention.</p>
      <p>The scientists recruited 138 people to participate in an overnight sleep assessment; 77 stayed awake all night, and 61 went home to sleep.</p>
      <p>All participants took two separate cognitive tasks in the evening.</p>
      <p>One measured reaction to stimulus, and another assessed a participant's ability to maintain their place in a series of steps without omitting or repeating a step - even after sporadic interruptions.</p>
      <p>They then repeated both tasks in the morning, to see how sleep deprivation affected their performance.</p>
      <p>Lead author Dr Kimberley Fenn said: "Our research showed that sleep deprivation doubles the odds of making place-keeping errors and triples the number of lapses in attention, which is startling.</p>
      <p>"Sleep-deprived individuals need to exercise caution in absolutely everything that they do, and simply can't trust that they won't make costly errors.</p>
      <p>"Oftentimes - like when behind the wheel of a car - these errors can have tragic consequences."</p>
      <p>By sharing their findings, the researchers hope that people will acknowledge how significantly their abilities are hindered by a lack of sleep.</p>
      <p>Co-author Michelle Stepan said: "Our findings debunk a common theory that suggests that attention is the only cognitive function affected by sleep deprivation.</p>
      <p>Researcher Ms Stepan said. "Some sleep-deprived people might be able to hold it together under routine tasks, like a doctor taking a patient's vitals.</p>
      <p>"But our results suggest that completing an activity that requires following multiple steps, such as a doctor completing a medical procedure, is much riskier under conditions of sleep deprivation.</p>
      <p>"After being interrupted there was a 15 per cent error rate in the evening and we saw that the error rate spiked to about 30 per cent for the sleep-deprived group the following morning.</p>
      <p>"The rested participants' morning scores were similar to the night before."</p>
      <p>Dr Fenn added: "There are some tasks people can do on auto-pilot that may not be affected by a lack of sleep.</p>
      <p>"However, sleep deprivation causes widespread deficits across all facets of life."</p>
