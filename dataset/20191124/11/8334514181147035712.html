      <p>SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China said on Sunday it would seek to improve protections for intellectual property rights, including raising the upper limits for compensation for rights infringements.</p>
      <p>An opinion document released by the State Council and Communist Partyâ€™s Central Office on Sunday evening called for a strengthening of protections through both the civil and criminal justice systems and an effective enforcement of penalties.</p>
      <p>The upper limits on legal compensation should be raised substantially, it said.</p>
      <p>The document said that by 2022, China should be making progress in issues that have affected intellectual property rights enforcement, such as low compensation, high costs, and the difficulty of proof. By 2025, there should be a better system of protection in place.</p>
