      <p>In other news, President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s spokesperson George Charamba has clarified on the welcome that was received by <b><a href="https://iharare.com/vp-chiwenga-returns-home-after-months-in-hospital/">Vice President Constantino Chiwenga who returned home in the early hours of Saturday morning</a></b>. Chiwenga spent more than 4 months away from the office after suffering from an undisclosed ailment, although s<b><a href="https://iharare.com/fresh-details-emerge-on-ailing-vice-presiden/">ome reports have said that he was poisoned</a></b>. However, the Vice President seems to have recovered well after he went for treatment in China where specialists from Zimbabwe, South Africa, India and China worked on his health.</p>
      <p>Following the return of the Vice President,  social media has been awash with speculation and conspiracy theories.

The lack of high-level government officials at the airport also roused interest in some who speculated that this was a clear indication that Chiwenga was not in good books with his principal, President Emmerson Mnangagwa.</p>
      <p>However, Charamba dismissed the speculation saying that it showed a poor grasp of state protocols, <i><b><a href="https://iharare.com/mnangagwas-spokesperson-clarifies-on-vp-chiwengas-return/">Continue Reading</a></b></i>,</p>
