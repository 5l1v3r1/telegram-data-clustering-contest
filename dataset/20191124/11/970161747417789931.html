      <p>K-Pop star Goo Hara has reportedly been found dead, <a href="https://www.soompi.com/article/1367711wpp/breaking-goo-hara-passes-away">according to Korean media</a>.</p>
      <p>Police say the singer, formerly a member of the girl group Kara, was found in her home in Cheongdam on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>Her cause of death is being investigated.</p>
      <p>Kara was originally made up of seven members, but the current line-up consisted of Hara, Gyuri, Seungyeon and Youngji.</p>
      <p>The group debuted in 2007 under DSP Media and released hits such as Cupid and Step.</p>
      <p>They disbanded in 2016.</p>
      <p>Japanese agency Production Ogi <a href="https://www.soompi.com/article/1367711wpp/breaking-goo-hara-passes-away">released a statement</a> which requested privacy for the star’s family.</p>
      <p>It read: ‘Hello. We are here to deliver tragic and unfortunate news.</p>
      <p>‘Family members and friends of Goo Hara are deeply shocked and anxious at the moment.</p>

      <p>‘Therefore, we earnestly request that you refrain from writing speculative articles and spreading rumors. In addition, we ask the media and fans to refrain from making condolence calls.</p>

      <p>‘We apologize for conveying this sudden news, and we are sorry once again for requesting that [the media and fans] refrain from making condolence calls.’</p>
      <p>Hara had recently signed with Production Ogi and released solo mini album Midnight Queen earlier this month.</p>
      <p>It comes just months after the 28-year-old allegedly attempted to take her own life after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/26/k-pop-star-goo-hara-safe-alleged-suicide-attempt-concerning-messages-9692746/">leaving concerning messages on Instagram</a>.</p>

      <p>Hara’s manager called the 119 Rescue Center and she was then taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>She was previously embroiled in a legal battle with her ex-boyfriend, Choi Jong Bum, who was indicted for allegedly threatening to release sex videos of himself and the K-pop star.</p>
      <p>Back in May, Bum apologised for the controversy surrounding the incident, saying in a statement posted on Instagram: ‘I want to sincerely apologize for causing so many people worry.</p>

      <p>‘All this time, I wasn’t able to respond to contacts from friends, acquaintances, and people who cared for me because my KakaoTalk account is gone.</p>
      <p>‘I apologize once again for making so many people worry for so long and for causing disappointment.’ He added: ‘I want to live in repentance for causing such deep disappointment to my peers who trusted and worked with me, the people who supported me, and my family [sic].’</p>
