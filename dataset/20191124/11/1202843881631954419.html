      <p>Doha: Family Consulting Centre (Wifaq) has entered the Guinness World Records by launching the largest bulletin board in the world to record children’s wishes.</p>
      <p>This marks the celebration of International Children’s Day, which takes place on November 20 every year, and the 30th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and under the sponsorship of Qatar Foundation for Social Work. </p>
      <p>The celebration falls in line within the framework of the centre’s keenness to participate in international and local events related to family affairs across all its fields.</p>

      <p>The centre launched the bulletin board on November 20 at Katara – the Cultural Village over an area of 105.72sq m, including 5,500 cards of children’s wishes. </p>
      <p>The achievement was certified by the relevant authorities, marking another Guinness record in Qatar.</p>
      <p>Through this initiative, Wifaq, with the participation of Aman Centre and Dreama, aimed to draw the world’s attention to the importance of protecting children everywhere. It also promoted strengthening of the childhood values system that the country pays great attention to, in addition to increasing public awareness of the centre’s efforts in the field of childcare, a statement noted.</p>
      <p>The centre also devoted awareness activities through social media sites, including a range of interactive awareness materials, in order to spread awareness of the importance of celebrating this day and highlighting the importance of building a positive relationship between parents and children and how to support them, enhance their coping skills and ways to meet their different needs.</p>
