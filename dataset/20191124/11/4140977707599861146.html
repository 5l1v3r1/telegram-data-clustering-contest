            <b>HAR Vs DEL Dream11 Team Probable Playing 11, Toss, Pitch And Match Report: Northern derby set to take the league alight as Haryana and Delhi square off in a humdinger</b>
          </p>
          <p>There could perhaps have been a better match to wrap up proceedings this Sunday in the Super League of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy than the edge of the seat thriller which is set to be dished out our way. When Haryana and Delhi will be going at loggerheads in the culminating encounter of the day in the showpiece domestic T2 tournamnet, we are bound to be in for a jaffer of a contest, a jaffer which enthrals and revels us in a resounding contest.</p>
          <p>What adds to the intrigue of today’s encounter is not just the fact that these two sides are familiar faces with the two being neighbours but also the fact that a win for either will propel them right into the pinnacles of Group A of the Super League. Currently in second place, Delhi have endured results on both sides of the docket with a win and loss apiece from their two matches.</p>

                <p>The side were most recently involved in a  thriller, a match where they ended up falling short infront of Baroda by the barest of margins as they faltered in pursuit of the 152 run target by the singular run as they folded out their pursuit at 150. Elsewhere, having played just the singular encounter, Haryana are hot on Delhi’s trail in third place after they managed to putdown Rajasthan by 4 wickets as they cruised their way to the 124 target with 28 balls in hand.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>A sublime wicket for the bats to come out and play their shots on, despite the heavy brunt of matches this wicket has had to endure, the bats have not been deterred in the slightest. The conditions have remained intact for the bats with us bound to be in for an extradonaire run feast, a match where the side winning the toss is set to come out and bat first.</p>

                            <h3>HAR Vs DEL Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>We are getting in two wicket-keepers in this section of our Dream 11 setup with both of them coming from Delhi. We begin with Anuj Rawat, one of their most successful and dependable bats in the domestic arena this season with the player having garnered the 183 runs in 8 matches till now.</p>
                            <p>We find company in the form of Rishabh Pant with the retuning wicket-keeper set to play his attribute for the first time for Delhi this tournament. The player has been in horrendous form in the international arena but the domestic format might just help him recover his touch to see us repose faith in him for this one.</p>
                            <h3>HAR Vs DEL Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>Continuing with the bats from Delhi and we have a deadly partnership line up our batting order in the form of Himmat Singh and captain Dhruv Shorey. Shorey was in abysmal touch in the early exchanges of the season but what was  a slow burner of a season for him has torched up as we have made an advent into the Super League stage to tally up the 142 runs in 7 matches.</p>
                            <p>Elsewhere from Haryana we finally have their first player being cantered into our setup with us entrusting top-order bat Shivam Chauhan for the day given his innate ability to come out and pen his arms with luscious ease.</p>
                            <h3>HAR Vs DEL Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>With 308 runs in 8 encounters, Harshal Patel has been the talisman of his side’s batting unit, a player who has found it way too easy to accumulate runs. His wristwork and expansive strokeplay has seen him get a bagful of runs to fill up his gloves, a name who has become an instrumental figure for the side in their quest of challenging for the glistening trophy.</p>
                            <p>Elsewhere, spinner Raul Tewatia has returned with the 5 wickets to see us rope him as well from Haryana while form Delhi we are venturing in with the services of Lalit Yadav. The bowler’s myriad skill set has seen him use his guile and tricky to put in vibrant displays and lead the side’s scoring ranks with the 8 wickets.</p>
                            <h3>HAR Vs DEL Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>He’s found ample and apt assistance in the form of Simarjeet Singh with the player having contributed the 8 wickets as well to ruffle oppositions and leave them in remorse to bring him in as well from Delhi. From Haryana meanwhile we are going in with their spin twins, two names who are perhaps the most daunting and indomitable spin partnership in the league with the two sending down an ominous brand of legspin to leave oppositions in a tiff. </p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Virat has been made our outfit’s captain for the prevelant clash while Rawat is our vice-captain.</p>
