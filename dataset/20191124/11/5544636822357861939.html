      <p>Suspected herdsmen have killed an unspecified number of people in a fresh attack on a village in Adamawa State, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that the gunmen attacked Shuws-Kala’a village in Hong LGA on Saturday, destroying valuable properties and human lives.</p>
      <p>A resident, Sani Ahmed, revealed that the herdsmen have constantly troubled the area since the start of the harvest season.</p>
      <p>“This morning the herdsmen attacked and robbed a man who went to the farm to bring home his harvest,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He returned and had barely informed the community of what happened to him when we saw them coming from all areas.</p>
      <p>“Our local vigilante guys quickly mobilized and put up resistance and were able to repel them.</p>
      <p>“Yes, there are casualties on both sides, but I cannot ascertain whether there were fatalities.”</p>
