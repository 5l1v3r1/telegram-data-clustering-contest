      <p>JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s telecoms regulator on Sunday delayed a tender for fifth-generation (5G) cellular frequencies after mobile companies asked for more time.</p>
      <p>The Communications Ministry in July published the tender in the hope that discounts to cash-strapped mobile phone operators battling fierce competition would entice bids. The tender was scheduled to take place on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“As far as the ministry is concerned, we are only postponing for two weeks,” a ministry spokesman said. “Requests for further delays will be considered by the committee.”</p>
      <p>One of the requests came from Partner Communications, Israel’s second-largest mobile operator, on grounds it was going through a board shake-up when a number of directors - including the chairman - resigned last week. On Thursday, Partner named Osnat Rosen as chairwoman.</p>
      <p>The telecoms regulator expects three groups to bid, including a combination of operators to cut down on costs. It had planned to announce winners by the end of the year, with a commercial launch to start in 2020 and continuing through 2023.</p>
      <p>Israel’s three main telecom operators — Cellcom, Partner and Bezeq unit Pelephone — are struggling to stay profitable in a country with nine million people and nine mobile providers after a sector shake-up in 2012.</p>
      <p>Israeli media said companies remain confused by the terms of the tender but the ministry said the tender model has been used 30 times in Europe and North America.</p>
      <p>Revenues in the mobile sector fell 5.6% in 2018 but the carriers will likely invest in 5G to meet growing demand, analysts say.</p>
      <p>Israel is offering incentives of up to 500 million shekels ($144 million), including delaying the need to pay for the license until 2022. The Communications Ministry will give grants to operators that deploy at least 250 5G antennas.</p>
