      <p>Mehmet Kandemir general manager at Cadbury House said: “The great thing about our Pantomime is that it is a lot more intimate than many shows you can see in the larger theatres meaning the kids can really get up close and personal with their favourite characters.</p>

      <p>“The show will be full of magical scenes, modern songs and spectacular costumes. It has been specially written to entertain children and will be put on by a professional cast and crew. With loads of interaction we expect lots of shouting, cheering and booing – and that’s just the parents!”</p>
