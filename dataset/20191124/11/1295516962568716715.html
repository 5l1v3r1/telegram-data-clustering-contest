      <h1>Avengers: Endgame Writers Explain Why Marvel Was Against Making Iron Man 4</h1>

      <p>Aside from Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man has been in the most MCU films, clocking in 10 appearances. However, most of these come from non-<i>Iron Man</i> movies, as a solo Tony Stark film has not been released since 2013's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/iron-man-3/"><i>Iron Man 3</i></a>.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview with <i><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/avengers-endgame-writers-alternate-storylines">Vanity Fair</a>, </i><i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/avengers-4/">Avengers: Endgame</a> </i>writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely explained why a fourth Iron Man solo film would not have made sense.</p>

      <p>"Whether you like all of the 24 movies or not, the capital that Marvel built up allowed them to do things like make a movie starring a raccoon and a tree, right? You would’ve already had <i>Iron Man 4</i> if it was any other studio," McFeely said. "But they decided, No, we’re going to take chances on all these other things. To put a flag in the ground and say, We’re going to end something and take characters off the table, is, I think, kind of daring, but selfishly it was really great for us."</p>

      <p>"It needs an end or it loses meaning," continued Markus. "The end is what cements the thing, to actually sew it together and bring it to a crescendo, and yeah, take people off the board, finish their arcs. If Tony made it out the other side, and <i>Iron Man 4</i> was waiting there, you’d be like, [shakes head] One too many..."</p>
