      <p>An ex- girlfriend of I’m A Celebrity star Myles Stephenson has alleged that the X-Factor singer is a “womanizer.”</p>
      <p>Rebecca Bignell, who previously dated the Rak-Su singer, told <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/myles-stephensons-ex-brands-im-20946257">The Sunday Mirror</a> that the female jungle campmates should be wary if he makes romantic advances.</p>
      <p>“Watch out. He’s after anything with a pulse,” Rebecca claimed to the paper.</p>

      <p>She said: “I thought he was my soulmate, but fame and money just turned him into somebody I don’t know.”</p>
      <p>Rebecca and Myles reportedly got together in 2016 before his 2017 appearance on the X Factor show.</p>
      <p>“Myles chased after me for years, but I didn’t want to know as I was getting over an ex,” she claimed. However, she said she soon fell for him, and alleged that they even discussed marriage.</p>

      <p>Her claims come days after Myles was accused of <a href="http://goss.ie/uk-showbiz/gabby-allen-bombarded-by-women-claiming-myles-stephenson-sexted-them-while-they-were-still-together-191546">“cheating” by Love Islander Gabby Allen.</a></p>
      <p>Rebecca claimed that seeing Gabby’s allegations has put her off Myles entirely.</p>
      <p>“I came to my senses last Thursday. I’m done with Myles Stephenson. He is a massive f*ckboy, charmer and narcissist,” she alleged.</p>
      <p>Myles has insisted that he never cheated on Gabby.</p>
