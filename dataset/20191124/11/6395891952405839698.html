      <p>According to <a href="https://www.wbtw.com/crime/pee-dee-crime/dillon-woman-charged-in-2-year-old-sons-death/">WBTW</a> and <a href="https://www.wmbfnews.com/2019/11/23/dillon-county-mother-charged-with-murder-connection-death-year-old-son/">WMBF</a>, 33-year-old Okedia Colvin's "extreme indifference to human life" caused the Nov. 7 death of the 2-year-old boy, whose feeding tube had stopped working properly, an arrest warrant said. Colvin never sought medical assistance for the child after the malfunction, investigators alleged.</p>
      <p>Colvin, who was jailed Friday on a charge of homicide by child abuse/neglect, remains in the Dillon County Detention Center, <a href="https://www.wmbfnews.com/2019/11/23/dillon-county-mother-charged-with-murder-connection-death-year-old-son/">WBTW reported</a>. </p>
      <p>The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division is investigating the incident and likely will release more details Monday, a spokesman <a href="https://www.wmbfnews.com/2019/11/23/dillon-county-mother-charged-with-murder-connection-death-year-old-son/">told WMBF</a>.</p>
