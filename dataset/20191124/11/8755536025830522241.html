      <p>Dancing With The Stars runner-up Anna Geary has opened up about her relationship with food and body image.</p>
      <p>The Irish sports star tied the knot last month, and revealed that she was constantly asked if she was losing weight for the big day.</p>
      <p>She revealed: “People kept asking me before the wedding, ‘Are you on a diet?'”</p>

      <p>“I was thinking then, ‘Should I be on one?’ “I’ve never met a calorie I didn’t like, I don’t have a sweet tooth, I have sweet teeth,” she told the Irish Sunday Mirror newspaper.</p>
      <p>“I feel we should eliminate the guilt we associate with food, it’s having a detrimental effect.”</p>
      <p>Anna says that social media has warped out perceptions of what a female body “should” look like.</p>
      <p>“Body image has been distorted from social media, this unrealistic image of perfection,” she said.</p>

      <p>“There’s too much of a focus on numbers now, putting massive pressure on people, it really upsets me when I hear people talking about good food and bad food and cheat food and sins.”</p>
      <p>“Something that’s bad is stealing a car, not eating a cake.”</p>
      <p>“We have such a temperamental relationship with food, I’m guilty of it myself, sometimes I go, ‘I shouldn’t have eaten that’ but then I think relax for a second.”</p>

      <p>Anna explained that food has always been a big part of her life, fueling both her sporty lifestyle and her love of socializing.</p>
      <p>“I love food, one of my favourite pastimes is eating and talking, I love pizza,” she said.</p>
      <p>“But I think it’s about being realistic, deprivation is never the answer to anything.”</p>
      <p>“I worry about younger people, the only reason I knew what a carb was because I learnt about it in home economics. Carb-free diets were foreign to me because I always played sport, carbohydrates to me are fuel, like a car needs petrol, how can you expect your body to work for you if you don’t nourish it with fuel?”</p>
