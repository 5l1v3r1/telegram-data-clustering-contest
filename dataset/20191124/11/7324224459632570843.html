      <h1>Labour West Bromwich candidate was forced to hand over £11,500 after tax evasion probe</h1>
      <h2>Labour's candidate to replace Tom Watson in Sandwell was accused of trying to smuggle more than £10,000 out of the country for the purpose of "tax evasion".</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:15:12+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/pete-madeley/" target="_blank">Peter Madeley</a></address>
      <p>Ibrahim Dogus, a kebab tycoon and the mayor of Lambeth, was embroiled in a tax evasion probe in 2011 after giving his aunt £11,500 in cash from his restaurant and asking her to take it to Istanbul on a flight from Heathrow.</p>
      <p>The money was seized by UK border officials, who found it in satin purses, envelopes and a sock with a zipped compartment.</p>
      <p>In a court case, Mr Dogus, who is a close friend of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, claimed the money was being sent to Turkey to repay a debt to his brother-in-law.</p>
      <p>However, UK Border Agency (UKBA) officials described his story as "unbelievable" and said his financial activities were "highly unorthodox".</p>
      <p>They said: "The UKBA submits that this cash is recoverable property, namely sourced from tax evasion."</p>
      <p>A judge upheld an application for the forfeiture of the cash under the Proceeds of Crime Act. He did not face criminal charges as the seizure fell under civil law.</p>

      <p>The revelations emerged following an investigation by <i>The Times</i>, and come just days after Mr Corbyn launched a manifesto that pledged the "biggest ever" crackdown on tax avoidance and evasion.</p>
      <p>Mr Dogus was parachuted in by Labour to fight West Bromwich East after deputy leader <a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/politics/general-election-2019/2019/11/06/labours-tom-watson-to-stand-down-at-election/">Tom Watson announced he was standing down for personal reasons.</a></p>
      <p>He had previously failed to gain candidacy in his home seat of Vauxhall and in Birmingham Hall Green.</p>
      <p>Mr Dogus's conduct has been questioned on several occasions in recent years.</p>
      <p>He was accused of paying staff at his restaurants "poverty wages" of less than £4 an hour, and faced criticism from Labour activists after he donated £1,250 to the Conservative Party in 2013.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Mr Dogus said he disagreed with the court's decision. "Mr Dogus rejects, in the strongest possible terms, any allegation of wrongdoing or illegality," he added.</p>
      <p>"He condemns any individual, organisation or business that does not pay its taxes fully.</p>
      <p>"Throughout the case that took place almost a decade ago, Mr Dogus sought to cooperate fully with the court and instructed his solicitor and legal team to do the same.</p>
      <p>"Mr Dogus no longer instructs the solicitor who acted for him in 2011 and reported the conduct of his previous solicitor to the relevant regulator."</p>
      <p>Labour is defending a majority of 7,713 in West Bromwich East, a seat which the party has always held.</p>
      <p>In a constituency with a 68 per cent Leave vote, Remainer Mr Dogus faces competition from pro-Brexit candidates Nicola Richards for the Tories, independent George Galloway, and the Brexit Party's Christian Lucas.</p>
