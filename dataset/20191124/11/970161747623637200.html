      <p>Dan Osborne has laughed off fans ‘rooting’ for his wife <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> to get with her fellow <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! campmate <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/myles-stephenson/">Myles Stephenson</a>.</p>
      <p>The Towie star, who married Jacqueline in 2017 and shares two children Ella, four, and Mia, one, with her, addressed audiences who want to see a jungle romance between her and the Rak-Su singer after being approached on Instagram.</p>
      <p>‘You gutted everyone is rooting for Myles n Jacqueline to get together??’ one user asked Dan on the photo-sharing app.</p>
      <p>‘[I] find it funny…,’ Dan replied. ‘She would not be attracted to Myles even if she was single, no kids, no nothing lol. He can try all he wants though, bless.’</p>
      <p>Looks like Dan’s not the slightest bit worried about any potential competition.</p>

      <p>In Saturday night’s episode, Jacqueline and Ian Wright were chosen as the next pair to face a trial to collect stars for camp.</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders star became very upset and had to be comforted by her campmates as she said: ‘I don’t want to do this anymore’.</p>

      <p>In a video shared on Instagram, Dan said: ‘I know I said to you all vote for Jac because she ain’t here to change light bulbs. I didn’t mean every single trial. Give her a break now. Come on.</p>
      <p>‘She keeps smashing them all. She’s worried about it but she’ll smash it. She’ll keep proving everyone. And she’s doing it with Ian Wright as well which is good. He’ll look after her.</p>
      <p>‘Let her do this one then just give her a break please. She’s getting upset now. It ain’t nice. But she’ll be good. She’ll smash it. She’ll get the stars, go back and have a nice dinner.’</p>

      <p>‘The thing is, everyone is missing their families, I just feel like it’s too soon to be crying missing your family…and we all smell so bad, we just stink, I stink, the smelliest I’ve ever been in my life,’ she said as she wiped away tears in the privacy of the jungle hut.</p>
