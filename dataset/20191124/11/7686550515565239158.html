      <h1>The immediate Neil Harris change at Cardiff City and one alarming aspect that still needs to be addressed</h1>
      <h2>The Bluebirds showed many encouraging signs in their 2-2 draw against Charlton at The Valley</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:32:53+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:32</time> by <a rel="author">Glen Williams</a></address>
      <p>Cardiff City's first game under Neil Harris ended in a draw, but we learned a great deal from that display at The Valley.</p>
      <p>The players showed tremendous resolve to come back from 2-0 down, despite the hosts having many of their first-team players missing, to salvage a point against Charlton.</p>
      <p>Here, we analyse the five things key points from the Bluebirds' clash at Charlton.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Evolving the style of play</b>
      </p>
      <p>Arguably the biggest positive to come out of the game at The Valley was the subtle change in the style of play.</p>
      <p>While Harris had spoken last week of wanting to evolve City's football, he urged caution over just how quickly that change would be seen.</p>
      <p>It's safe to say there was a notable change to Cardiff's approach against Charlton, with the ball on the floor far more regularly, looking to link up the play with a series of passes and exciting runs rather than hopeful balls to the front man.</p>
      <p>Let's not forget that much of this game was played without the likes of Lee Tomlin or Joe Ralls, both of whom will only better that more fluid style.</p>
      <p>"Some of the football we played was good," Harris said. "I want to make extra passes and play a little bit more football.</p>
      <p>"We've got to have the ability to play forward and run forward."</p>
      <p>It was certainly an encouraging start and the building blocks are there for a more aesthetically-pleasing style of play to be implemented moving forward.</p>

        <b>Defence needs real attention</b>
      </p>
      <p>How many times on the road have we seen Cardiff City kick points away this season through poor defending? While at the start of the season, perhaps once or twice, it can be forgivable, but it is becoming a real concern.</p>
      <p>While Harris wouldn't say as much after the match, he will be taking a long, hard look at Cardiff's defence and will need to find out which combination works best at centre back.</p>
      <p>If Aden Flint isn't winning balls in the opposition box, are his defensive qualities enough to warrant him a place in the side?</p>
      <p>And while Curtis Nelson was impressive in his last two outings, he was a little shaky at times at The Valley.</p>
      <p>Will Sol Bamba ever really recapture his full fitness? And can Sean Morrison find his best form to take command of this failing defence once again?</p>
      <p>They are all questions that need to be answered very quickly and if they can't be, investment simply must be made in January.</p>

      <p>
        <b>A clean slate</b>
      </p>
      <p>When Harris said all his players had a clean slate, he really meant it. No one's position in the team is safe.</p>
      <p>The manager revealed after the game that he opted for Gary Madine to play up front because he had impressed him in training and was hungry for the opportunity.</p>
      <p>Indeed Madine got himself in some good areas and will have been annoyed not to have tested the goalkeeper more, given the chances he was presented with.</p>
      <p>Callum Paterson was also afforded the opportunity to impress, too, having been a bit-part player for large parts of the season so far. The Scot appears to be the typical Harris player, wholehearted, determined and physical alongside another striker. However his best form has evaded him so far this season, too.</p>
      <p>It was also telling that Will Vaulks was one of the substitutes that was used. The Wales international had not played a minute of Championship football in over three months and it will be a real boost of confidence for him that Harris turned to him in a crucial juncture of the game.</p>
      <p>"Players will only play in my team if they earn the right to play," Harris said after the match.</p>
      <p>"Some of the players have hit standards today that I expect and demand, some will have to get up to speed."</p>
      <p>Impress the manager in training by working hard and showcasing your ability and that's your ticket into the team. No more resting on laurels.</p>

        <b>A delicate midfield balance has to be struck</b>
      </p>
      <p>While many would agree that Marlon Pack and Leandro Bacuna are having fine seasons, Harris' formation at Charlton highlighted an area of potential concern.</p>
      <p>Pack has been one of the standouts this term, but in that first half was overrun. Bacuna didn't cover himself in glory for the most part either, but his dynamism can occasionally get him out of trouble.</p>
      <p>If Harris persists with just two central midfield players, as he often liked to do while in charge of Millwall, the Bluebirds have to master that system quickly.</p>
      <p>Pack undoubtedly has the nous to play in a midfield two. Granted he might not be the quickest, but that role is all about positioning and understanding â€“ his leadership is a huge plus in there, too.</p>
      <p>But Harris, on more than one occasion, said his players need 'legs' to play his system and that is where Joe Ralls might be the perfect player to slot straight into this side.</p>
      <p>His incredible work rate, tenacity in defence and productivity in attack this season could really see him flourish in a midfield two. But of Bacuna and Pack, who plays alongside him?</p>
      <p>That remains to be seen, but it is a crucial combination that Cardiff simply have to get right in order to avoid any more calamitous starts like they did at The Valley.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Slow out of the blocks</b>
      </p>
      <p>Why is it that Cardiff come to life only in the dying moments of games? Why do they leave it until the last minute to bail themselves out of trouble?</p>
      <p>They have started woefully in so many games this season. Hull, Derby, Birmingham, Reading, West Brom, Sheffield Wednesday and now Charlton.</p>
      <p>It appears they pull it out of the bag only when they are scrapping for their lives, but why do they put themselves behind the eight ball so quickly, so often?</p>
      <p>Perhaps this one could be forgiven, having to adjust to a new system for the first time, but moving forward, that needs to be far better. They need to ride out the first 20 minutes and calm everything down.</p>
      <p>Leaders need to take control and they must keep possession of the ball. It's all so frantic and disjointed from the off and the players, as Harris said, must take responsibility.</p>
