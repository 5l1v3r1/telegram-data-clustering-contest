      <p>Following last week's California Horse Racing Board meeting, Aidan Butler, who's heading up California racing for The Stronach Group, shared with reporters that there's a "big conversation" ongoing about installing a synthetic surface at Santa Anita Park.</p>
      <p>According to the Los Angeles Times, <b><a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2019-11-24/horse-racing-newsletter?utm_source=Horse+Racing&amp;utm_campaign=f67d32593c-HORSE_RACING_NEWSLETTER_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f97a24dcb5-f67d32593c-82390313">which published a Q&amp;A from the conversation on Sunday morning</a></b>, Butler said he and The Stronach Group's Chief Veterinary Officer, Dionne Benson, accompanied Dr. Mick Peterson, on a visit to Tapeta Farm in Maryland.</p>
      <p>Trainer Michael Dickinson established Tapeta Footings in 2005 and has since introduced multiple editions of the synthetic surface designed specifically for Thoroughbred racehorses.</p>
      <p>"We feel the latest iterations of Tapeta are far better than in the old versions," Butler said, according to the Los Angeles Times. "As a side note, we have a real-world working example of Tapeta at Golden Gate. Everyone is real happy with it from the horsemen to track operations.</p>
      <p>"We’re fairly confident it will be good. But again, I’ve got to make sure whatever we do is done absolutely right. As far as products go, Tapeta is the best one out there."</p>
      <p>Butler said "nothing is off the table" as far as how Santa Anita could be configured in the future, saying Tapeta could be brought in for the internal training track. He also hinted at a rumor that turf may one day circled the outside of a main synthetic track at in Arcadia, Calif.</p>
      <p>"Whatever we decide has to be done the right way," Butler said. "...It’s up to the whole industry to get it right once and for all. … It seems it’s been a little hit or miss, worked well in some places and not so well in others."</p>
      <p>Santa Anita, where equine fatalities made national news this past year, ran over a short-lived Cushion Track beginning 2007 and switched to Pro-Ride by 2008. In 2010, it reverted to dirt, thought he track experienced some of its lowest rates of fatalities in seasons on synthetics. Detractors pointed to excessive heat absorbed by the surface and, anecdotally, soft tissue injuries experienced by horses running over it.</p>
