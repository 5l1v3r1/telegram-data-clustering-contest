      <p>She narrated;</p>
      <blockquote>Back in 2010 my ex husband was unemployed, i’ll come back from work to a clean house everyday, washing would be done, sometimes even supper was cooked. Came back early one day and found this lady cleaning, turns out she was my husband girlfriend, she has been doing this all along.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I lost the case when families came together to discuss the matter.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>I am not laughing hey…but your ex decided to outsource the work…😲😲😂… – @mphobmt<br/><br/>She knew her place and your hubby made sure you came back to a clean home and you didn’t have to lift a finger, you just rest nje after work. Husband of the decade award belongs to him – @King704Mph<br/><br/>Uhm uhm uhm… but she was healthy for the relationship 😂 – @Banele_C<br/><br/>So he hired a cleaner for you guys and it worked. I don’t see the problem here. 🤷🏽‍♂ – @Peabss<br/><br/>That man might have cheated but at least he was good at something, getting you a maid without having to waste any money. And that other woman damn she would have made a great sister-wife – @Dimakatso_DMH<br/><br/>She was doing her internship in your marriage, gaining some experience🙊🙊 – @gloriabman<br/><br/>So you had a maid who did your laundry, clean the house and cook for you for free!!! And. you had to ruin it wena… wow women are worst!! – @KCollenm1</blockquote>
