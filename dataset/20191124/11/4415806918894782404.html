      <p>Gardaí have arrested a man in connection with the death of another man in Cloverhill Prison yesterday.</p>
      <p>Emergency services were called to the scene at around midnight following an incident between two inmates.</p>
      <p>The man, who is in his 50s, was arrested at Cloverhill Prison on suspicion of murder.</p>
      <p>He is being questioned at Clondalkin Garda Station under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.</p>
      <p>It follows the death of a man in his late 30s at the prison in the early hours of yesterday morning, while a second man received minor injuries.</p>
      <p>The Irish Prison Service has launched and investigation, and has stressed that all practicable measures are taken by prison management and staff to ensure the safety of those in custody.</p>
      <p>However, the IPS did acknowledge that no prison system can be completely free of violence and inter prisoner assaults do occur.</p>
      <p>A post-mortem was completed on the man's body yesterday by State Pathologist Doctor Margaret Bolster.</p>
      <p>The results will not be released for operational reasons.</p>
