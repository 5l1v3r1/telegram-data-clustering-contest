        <b>Just over half of people in the Republic of Ireland would support a referendum on Irish unity within the next five years, a poll has found.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The poll, which was conducted by Amarach research and Claire Byrne Live for <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/united-ireland-border-poll-results-4896963-Nov2019/">TheJournal.ie</a> concluded that 51% of the Irish population would welcome an Irish unity referendum within five years.</p>
      <p>29% said they would not like to see the referendum whereas 20% replied to the poll as unsure. Over 1000 adults over the age of 18 took part in the research, conducted earlier in the week.</p>
      <p>If a poll on the border between Northern Ireland and the South was to take place, those in the North would be asked if they wanted to remain part of the United Kingdom or form a United Ireland.</p>
      <p>After that, and depending on the result, The Republic would then vote on the matter.</p>
      <p>The Northern Ireland Secretary of State can initiate a border poll under the Good Friday Agreement where it is clear that the opinion of the public has swayed toward the island's unification.</p>
      <p>According to the poll, Munster was the province most in favour of the referendum on Irish unity, with 62% saying they would like to see on in the next five years.</p>

      <p>Leinster, excluding Dublin, were 55% in favour of the referendum while both Connacht and Ulster were 47% in favour. Dublin people were only 40% in favour of the referendum.</p>
      <p>When it comes to the age demographics of the poll, those between 18-24 were heavily in favour of a referendum, with 70% replying on favour and only 9% saying they were against the idea.</p>
      <p>Those aged 45-54 and 55+ were the least in favour of a unity referendum, with only 43% support.</p>
      <p>The Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, spoke last month of his desire to see a united Ireland within his lifetime, saying: "I would, but only in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement, so that's only with the consent of the majority of people in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>"That's really important stuff and nobody should be forced into anything they don't want," he said.</p>
      <p>"And also, I think, if we ever get to that point, we need to make sure that unionists in Northern Ireland and British people in Northern Ireland feel that a united Ireland is a warm place for them.</p>
      <p>"We don't want to have a repeat of what happened 100 years ago when a minority was left behind."</p>
