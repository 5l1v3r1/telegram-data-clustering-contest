      <h1>For Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, party’s support is key to his political survival</h1>
      <h2>Benjamin Netanyahu’s top rival within the party is calling for an immediate primary vote to replace him, sowing the first seeds of rebellion.</h2>

      <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu looked to project business as usual on Sunday as he returned to work following his indictment on graft charges, but a wall of silence from his usually loyal Cabinet Ministers indicated tough times ahead for the embattled Israeli leader.</p>
      <p>Mr. Netanyahu is determined to fight the charges from the Prime Minister’s office. But long before the proceedings begin, it could be his own Likud party that decides his political future as the country appears to be heading toward elections.</p>
      <p>One top Likud official, Gideon Saar, has already announced his intention to challenge Mr. Netanyahu in party primaries as other typical backers have said he should resign.</p>
      <p>“There isn’t a single person who thinks that after a third or fourth or fifth or sixth election, Netanyahu will succeed in forming a government,” Mr. Saar told <i>Channel 12 TV</i> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The open call is a risky manoeuvre in a party that fiercely values loyalty and has had only four leaders in its 70-plus-year history. He made no mention of his indictment during Sunday’s meeting, talking about Iran, threats from Gaza and domestic affairs.</p>
      <p>But perhaps influenced by polls showing a majority of Israelis thinking Mr. Netanyahu should step down, the party’s most senior Ministers pointedly remained mum. Foreign Minister Israel Katz, Internal Security Minister Gilad Erdan, among others, are all straddling the sidelines as Mr. Netanyahu precariously clings to power.</p>
      <p>With just 18 days to go to either form a new government or trigger new elections, pressure will surely be mounting on these and other officials to show their hand.</p>
      <p>"Gideon Saar yesterday salvaged the dignity of a party that was once great, stormy, free and democratic,” wrote <i>Maariv </i>columnist Ben Caspit. “Nearly all of the top Likud officials agree with Saar. They agree, but tremble in fear. They’re heroes behind closed doors.”</p>
      <p>The attorney general’s decision to indict Mr. Netanyahu on fraud, breach of trust and bribery charges Thursday shook up Israel’s political system, which is in paralysis after inconclusive elections in April and September.</p>
      <p>With neither Mr. Netanyahu nor his main rival, former military chief Benny Gantz, able to secure a parliamentary majority, the country seems to be barreling toward its third election in under 12 months.</p>
      <p>Most observers believe a unity government between their parties, which together control a majority of seats in parliament, is the best way out of the crisis. But the main obstacle to that has emerged as Mr. Netanyahu himself. Mr. Gantz and his partners have ruled out a power-sharing rotation with an indicted prime minister and urged Mr. Likud to choose a different leader.</p>
      <p>Unlike mayors or regular ministers, the Prime Minister is not explicitly required by Israeli law to resign if indicted and Netanyahu is steadfastly vowing to remain in office.</p>
      <p>So the only practical way to unseat him would be if he were ousted from within, a scenario that until recently was unthinkable.</p>
      <p>Mr. Netanyahu, the longest serving leader in Israeli history, is desperate to remain in office as he faces indictment since it affords him a preferable legal defense. He’s angrily lashed out at police and prosecutors, accusing them of staging “an attempted coup,” and bemoaning a crooked system that is out to get him.</p>
      <p>As the party’s most popular politician, MR. Netanyahu has enjoyed the unquestioning backing of both Likud’s top officials and its rank-and-file members. But if he becomes an electoral liability, that loyalty could begin to fray.</p>
      <p>A poll commissioned by <i>Channel 13 News</i> after the attorney general’s decision showed that 56% of the public thinks Netanyahu should resign and only 35% said they think he can keep serving. The poll, which surveyed 750 people and had a margin of error of 4 percentage points, also showed Mr. Gantz’s Blue and White party extending its lead over Mr. Likud.</p>
      <p>The parties don’t appear to have significant ideological gaps and a leader other than Mr. Netanyahu would seemingly have a relatively easy time establishing a power-sharing agreement.</p>
