      <p>The relegation worries of Brazilian top-flight football team Cruzeiro deepened on Saturday when they surrendered an early lead to go down 4-1 away from home to Santos.</p>
      <p>SANTOS: The relegation worries of Brazilian top-flight football team Cruzeiro deepened on Saturday when they surrendered an early lead to go down 4-1 away from home to Santos.</p>
      <p>Luis Orejuela gave the Belo Horizonte side the lead after 14 minutes but a goal from Eduardo Sasha midway through the first half brought Santos level before Marinho and Yeferson Soteldo scored in quick succession in the second half.</p>

      <p>Diego Pituca made it four in the 90th minute.</p>
      <p>The result extends Cruzeiro's winless run to five games and leaves them five places from bottom of Serie A, one point ahead of Fluminense, who have a game in hand. The bottom four teams are relegated to Serie B at the end of the football season.</p>
      <p>At the other end of the table, Santos move into second place, above Palmeiras on goal difference. Palmeiras play Gremio on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Flamengo, who beat River Plate 2-1 to win the Copa Libertadores on Saturday, need just three points from their final four games to clinch the league title.</p>
