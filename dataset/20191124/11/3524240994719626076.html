      <h1>US Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg treated for chills, fever</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:13:24+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:13</time> by <a rel="author">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the US Supreme Court’s eldest justice and a stalwart of its liberal wing, was admitted to the hospital with chills and fever, the court announced Saturday.</p>
      <p>Her recent repeated health scares have sparked speculation about potential retirement, which would allow conservative US President Donald Trump to nominate a replacement.</p>
      <p>As of late Saturday, however, her symptoms had abated and she “expects to be released from the hospital as early as Sunday morning,” the court said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The 86-year-old was admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore Friday night after an initial evaluation at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg, who is one of four liberal justices on the court, was recovering thanks to “intravenous antibiotics and fluids,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>In August she completed a three-week course of outpatient radiation therapy in New York for a localized malignant tumor on her pancreas.</p>
      <p>She was treated for colon cancer in 1999, and a decade later, pancreatic cancer that was caught at an early stage. In December 2018, she had two nodules removed from her lung.</p>
      <p>US Supreme Court justices are appointed for life. She has repeatedly said she will only retire when she feels incapable of handling the workload.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg is fondly known as “The Notorious RBG,” a riff on slain rapper The Notorious B.I.G.</p>
