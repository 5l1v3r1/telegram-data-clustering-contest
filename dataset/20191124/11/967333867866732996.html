      <p>A 24-year-old asylum seeker from Afghanistan ravaged a supermarket in Nordhausen, Thuringia in central Germany, on Thursday afternoon destroying hundreds of alcohol bottles at a supermarket.</p>
      <p>In a video from security cameras, the man <a href="http://sputniknews.com/analysis/20190729/1076399826.html">was seen walking along an aisle</a> with liquor bottles before he started violently knocking the bottles on the floor.</p>

      <p>Personnel at the store then asked customers to evacuate the market's premises for security reasons.</p>
      <p>The man was later detained by the police outside the grocery store and they <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201906011075536334-police-officers-migrants-riot-germany/">took him to a nearby hospital</a> because he appeared "unstable".</p>
      <p>According to the police, the asylum seeker attempted to set the liquor on fire after he broke the bottles.</p>
      <p>The damage incurred by the man's actions is estimated to be 1,000 euros, the police added.</p>
