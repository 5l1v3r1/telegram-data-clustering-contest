      <p>And now a freedom of information request has revealed members of the public felt "embarrassed" by the marches and subsequent clashes.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/nicola-sturgeon-bombarded-letters-emails-20946270">Daily Record</a>, the First Minister was flooded with emails and letters from concerned punters.</p>
      <p>One punter claimed to have been subjected to vile racist abuse during the processions, calling on the government to clamp down on the marches.</p>

      <p>His letter, released under the FOI Act with the his name covered, said: “For the first time in my 43 years of being born, ­educated and living in the west of Scotland I am embarrassed to be a Glaswegian.</p>
      <p>“I have been a victim of racially-­motivated hate crime a number of times ­living in ­Glasgow.</p>
      <p>“Most recently, I was pushed on to the road and called a 'black b******' when I was walking with my wife on a ­Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“I have never felt I was not ­Glaswegian or ­Scottish but I was embarrassed to be both.</p>

      <p>“I work for a recruitment agency focused on ­attracting talent to Scotland based on the quality of life.</p>
      <p>“After ­witnessing these events, I do not see what the attraction would be for any new immigrant to Scotland.</p>
      <p>“I am asking you to question why the Scottish Government has not done more to stop any of the hate-filled marches taking place in Scotland.”</p>

      <p>One local emailed Sturgeon, also claiming to be ashamed of the scenes as he showed Canadian friends round the city.</p>
      <p>He said: “On Saturday, my wife and I decided to meet friends in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>“Little did we know our day would be ruined by bigots on both sides of the divide. Our friends were visiting from ­Canada and could not understand the scenes we witnessed.</p>
      <p>“My wife and I were embarrassed listening to the bile and insults hurled. These marches need to be banned to stop the shameful scenes we witnessed.”</p>
      <p>Many of the those complaining called for a ban on Orange walks.</p>
      <p>One letter said: "What is happening when the powers that be continue to allow anti-­Catholic parades to parade by Catholic churches?</p>
      <p>“It seems ­anti-Catholic hatred is getting worse in ­Scotland.”</p>
      <p>And another Glaswegian blasted the "simpletons" in the processions, saying: "These ­hateful, bigoted marches are ­disgusting, ­unnecessary and ­embarrassing.</p>
      <p>“For these ­simpletons to march and ­celebrate ­something that happened in 1690 is bizarre.”</p>

      <p>Others voiced their concerns about the Republican marches in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>One letter said: “I was horrified at the ­trouble that came about on Saturday regarding another ­Republican walk.”</p>
      <p>Another wrote: “I am angry and ­astonished at the decision to allow another Republican march in Glasgow.</p>

      <p>“The fact that they support the ­terrorist group the IRA is totally ­unacceptable and it should never have been allowed to take place.”</p>
      <p>One local praised <a href="http://bit.ly/2Lgi8Vn">Sturgeon for speaking out</a> against the marches after she <a href="http://bit.ly/2Lgi8Vn">blasted the "utterly unacceptable" behaviour</a> in Govan in August.</p>
      <p>But they added: “It is not enough to talk about it. These marches cause nothing but hatred and trouble so the time has come for government to step in.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Scottish Government said: “We are clear that while peaceful protest is an important part of our democracy, violent and sectarian disruption is not.</p>

      <p>“That is why we support collective action to achieve a zero-tolerance approach to sectarianism and violent and offensive behaviour.</p>
      <p>"This protects the right to peaceful public assembly and protest, but also safeguards communities and ensures that scenes such as those witnessed in Glasgow earlier this year are not repeated.</p>
      <p>“We have invested more than £14 million in work tackling sectarianism over the last seven years to support over 100 anti-sectarianism projects and fully support Police Scotland taking robust and proportionate action against any perpetrators of such behaviour.</p>
      <blockquote>“I have never felt I was not ­Glaswegian or ­Scottish but I was embarrassed to be both [during the marches]."<cite>Angry Scot in letter to Nicola Sturgeon</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“We welcome Dr Michael Rosie’s independent national review of marches, parades and demonstrations, as well as Glasgow City Council’s additional review.</p>
      <p>“It is clear from the correspondence we have received that the general public shares our desire for a Scotland free from sectarianism and violent disorder.”<br/><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/4695577/schoolboy-arrest-glasgow-erupts-into-mayhem-republicans-loyalists-clash/">Violent mayhem erupted</a> after <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/4695577/schoolboy-arrest-glasgow-erupts-into-mayhem-republicans-loyalists-clash/">Loyalist protesters met Republican marchers</a> in Glasgow city centre in September.</p>
      <p>We revealed later that month that - <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4712577/glasgow-loyalist-republican-marches-all-banned-council/">despite a temporary ban</a> - the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4765298/glasgow-council-no-power-ban-marches-loyalist-republican/">council "has no legal power" to stop the processions</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4697052/schoolboy-arrested-sectarian-chaos-glasgow/">Two schoolboys, aged 14 and 15,</a> were among <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/4695577/schoolboy-arrest-glasgow-erupts-into-mayhem-republicans-loyalists-clash/">11 arrested during the ugly scenes in Glasgow</a>.</p>
      <p>Cops blasted the "recklessness and stupidity" of those who <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4694446/glasgow-republican-march-loyalist-protesters-bottles-flares-police/">launched pyrotechnics which injured an officer</a> along Clyde Street.</p>
      <p>Scottish Police Federation vice-chair David Hamilton also <a href="http://bit.ly/2N6FS00">warned that someone could even be maimed by a flare if the violence continues</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4712577/glasgow-loyalist-republican-marches-all-banned-council/">Six marches were banned</a> the following weekend - with <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4718780/loyalist-george-square-glasgow-city-council/">Loyalist groups holding a protest</a> in the city centre.</p>
      <p>Hundreds <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4718780/loyalist-george-square-glasgow-city-council/">joined the Orange Order</a> and Scottish Protestants Against Discrimination in <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4718780/loyalist-george-square-glasgow-city-council/">George Square.</a></p>
      <p>It was revealed that 600 officers were required for just ONE day of marches in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Cops were pulled in from all over the country - at a cost of more than £176,000.</p>
      <p>Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said: "We drew officers from across the country away from their key role in our communities.</p>
      <p>“In terms of resource levels, is it sustainable? No, it’s not.”</p>
