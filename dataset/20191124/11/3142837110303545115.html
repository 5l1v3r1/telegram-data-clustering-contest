      <p><a href="https://www.americanconsumernews.net/scripts/click.aspx?Zacks=1">Zacks Investment Research</a> downgraded shares of Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) from a hold rating to a sell rating in a research note issued to investors on Wednesday morning, <a href="https://www.zacks.com//">Zacks.com</a> reports. The brokerage currently has $39.00 target price on the stock.</p>
      <p>According to Zacks, “The firm’s product and technology launches, in sync with the “More Roads to Harley-Davidson” growth plan, are likely to expand product portfolio and customer base. In a bid to establish itself as the leader in the electrification of motorcycles, Harley-Davidson will launch the high-techLiveWire, which will boost sales and prospects.Notably, the firm is emphasizing on bolstering dealer networks.However, with the lack of youth appeal and fewer people riding motorcycles, sales of Harley Davidson’s bikes are on the decline, both domestically and internationally.Due to incremental tariff costs, and restructuring and marketing expenses, the company has trimmed its full-year operating margin guidance. The company’s elevated leverage of 71% is also a concern. Hence, investors are recommended to wait for a better entry point.”</p>
