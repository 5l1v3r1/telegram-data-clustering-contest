      <p>An officer of the Kano State Road and Traffic Agency (KAROTA) was on Saturday crushed to death by a truck driver at Hotoro Mega Filling Station, within the metropolis.</p>
      <p>The Nation reports that, the incident happened a day after the police in Kano arrested a driver (Alkasim Usaini) who also ran over another official of the agency (Ahmad Tijjani) on the 29th of Oct, 2019 while on duty.</p>
      <p>In a statement signed by the Public Relations Officer of the agency, Nabilisi Abubakar K/Na’isa in Kano on Sunday,explained that the deceased identified as Abdulrahaman was killed by the reckless truck driver.</p>
      <p>He said body of deceased officer has since been evacuated from the scene and rushed to the Murtala Muhammad Specialist Hospital.</p>
      <p>He was pronounced dead before he was attended by the doctors on duty.</p>

      <p>The Managing Director of the Agency, Baffa Dan’agundi, said ” we are bereaved and sad over the unfortunate incident and as well condole with the family members of the late officer.</p>
      <p>Dan’agundi, however, warned the general public to desist from such act as the law would catch up with anyone who engages in committing such crime.</p>
      <p>Luck, however, ran out for the driver, as colleagues and other people around the scene of the incident succeeded in preventing the driver from escaping, as he was arrested and handed over to the police in the area for further investigation.</p>
