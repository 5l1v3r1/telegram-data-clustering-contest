      <h1>Aldi Kevin the Carrot fans outraged as toys sell out after huge website queue</h1>
      <h2>Aldi shoppers told how they woke up early to pre-order Kevin the Carrot toys which sold out quickly while they were in a queue of 20,000 customers at one point</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:16:37+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:16</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/aldi">Aldi</a> shoppers were left disappointed as Kevin the Carrot plush toys sold out quickly while thousands were stuck in a massive online queue.</p>
      <p>Customers told how they woke up in the early hours of Sunday morning for a chance to pre-order the collection of characters, but they were all gone within just a few hours.</p>
      <p>A woman told Mirror Online: "I was in the queue from midnight till 6am and a majority of the plush toys were sold out and only a few mugs were left."</p>
      <p>By 11.30am, almost 220,000 users had visited Aldi's website for a chance to purchase Kevin and Katie the Carrot, the Carrot Kids - Chantenay, Jasper and Baby - and their friends Russell Sprout and Tiny Tom.</p>
      <p>Frustrated customers told how 20,000 people were ahead of them in the queue at one point.</p>

      <p>One shopper told the Mirror he was given a 10 minute slot to buy the characters, but he fell asleep and missed his turn to purchase them at 3.30am.</p>
      <p>It was a repeat of last year when the Kevin the Carrot toys sold out quickly.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> user wrote after they went on sale on Sunday: "Just waited 20 mins to get on Aldi website for Kevin the carrot and they are completely sold out #scandalous."</p>

      <p>Another wrote: "I didn't wake up early enough, so went on the Aldi website at 9:30. I had to queue 15 minutes to view the site &amp; then unsurprisingly the Kevin the Carrot stuff I wanted was sold out.</p>
      <p>"I wonder what time I should have tried? I'll have to take my chances in store on Thursday."</p>
      <p>And one tweeted: "Trying to get onto the Aldi website to find I’m in a queue of 10,000 people all because THEY want a Kevin the carrot. Mental. What’s happening to the world."</p>

      <p>The characters cost £3.99 each and will go on sale in stores on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Only character bundles were available during Sunday's online pre-order.</p>
      <p>Aldi wrote to customers on Twitter: "Due to popular demand, Kevin and the rest of the range do tend to sell out quickly.</p>
      <p>"But please don't worry! These characters will also be available to purchase individually in store on Thursday 28th November."</p>
      <p>Just before 11am, the supermarket wrote on the page where customers were queuing: "Oops! It looks like we’re all sold out of Kevin and friend’s plush toys.</p>
      <p>"Give your local Aldi store a try from Thursday 28th November to see what’s on offer."</p>
      <p>A spokesman told Mirror Online: “We’re sorry that some shoppers were unable to get their hands on these toys online this morning, however, demand has been extremely high.</p>
      <p>“The range will be stocked in-store from 28 November but, as with all of our Specialbuy products, these will also only be available while stocks last.”</p>
      <p>Aldi is also selling giant Kevin and Katie the Carrot plush toys - standing a metre tall for £19,99 each - and other merchandise including books and tree decorations in the run-up to Christmas.</p>
