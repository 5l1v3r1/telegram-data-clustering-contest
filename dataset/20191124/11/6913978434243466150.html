      <p><b>TEL AVIV -</b> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's centrist rival Benny Gantz Saturday urged leaders of the premier's Likud party to join him in forming a government after their chief's indictment on corruption charges.<br/><br/>"In light of the circumstances, I call for the formation of the largest possible government under my leadership," Gantz told a news conference, addressing members of the right-wing Likud.<br/><br/>"I would be the prime minister for the first two years," he said.<br/><br/>And if Netanyahu "is cleared (of any wrongdoing) he could return and become prime minister", Gantz added.<br/><br/>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit announced Thursday he had charged Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, prompting speculation that the end of the premier's decade-long tenure was nigh.<br/><br/>The indictment came as Israel edged closer to its third general election in a year, after two inconclusive polls in April and September.<br/><br/>On Wednesday former army general Gantz, whose party gained one more seat than Likud in the September poll, said he was unable to form a government and secure a majority in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament.<br/><br/>Gantz, leader of the centrist Blue and White coalition, was asked to form a government by President Reuven Rivlin after Netanyahu also failed to do so.<br/><br/>Netanyahu remains the country's interim premier, however.<br/><br/>Parliament now has less than three weeks to find a candidate who can gain the support of more than half of the Knesset's 120 lawmakers, or a deeply unpopular third election will be called.<br/><br/>Gantz, speaking in Tel Aviv, said his proposal was "the only alternative to holding new elections".<br/><br/>Under Israeli law, while ministers cannot remain in place after being indicted, a prime minister is not legally required to resign unless convicted and with any appeals processes exhausted.<br/><br/>In addition to the premiership, Netanyahu holds portfolios including agriculture and health, positions he may have to vacate in the coming days.<br/><br/>Netanyahu, the first Israeli prime minister to be indicted in office on corruption charges, has denounced a "coup" against him, dismissed the charges as "false" and "politically motivated" and vowed to hold onto power. -AFP</p>
