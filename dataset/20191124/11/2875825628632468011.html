      <h1>Man in his 50s arrested after inmate found murdered in Cloverhill Prison in Dublin</h1>
      <h2>Reports suggest warders had to pull a fellow prisoner off him when they entered the cell following an altercation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:40:13+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Emma McMenamy, Edel Hughes, Darragh Berry</a></address>
      <p>A man in his 50s has been arrested after an inmate at a <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/dublin">Dublin</a> prison was found murdered in his cell.</p>
      <p>Inmate Mark Lawlor was found dead shortly after midnight on Saturday following reports of a vicious row with a fellow prisoner.</p>
      <p>Mr Lawlor, who was in his 30s, was a petty criminal who had been in custody in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cloverhill-prison">Cloverhill Prison</a> for just over a week facing theft charges.</p>
      <p>Prison staff tried to resuscitate Lawlor but he could not be revived.</p>
      <p>Reports suggest warders had to pull a fellow prisoner off him when they entered the cell following an altercation.</p>
      <p>Gardai launched a murder inquiry following the death.</p>

      <p>A garda spokesperson said: "The man was arrested at Cloverhill Prison on suspicion of murder.</p>
      <p>"He is currently detained at Clondalkin Garda Station under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984."</p>
      <p>Gardai also revealed a post-mortem examination on Mr Lawlor's body has been completed but the results are not being released for operational reasons.</p>
      <p>A source said: “Inmates in the cell next to Lawlor’s heard a commotion and notified warders but Lawlor was already dead by the time they got to him.</p>
      <p>“They had to pull the other inmate off him.</p>
      <p>“It’s understood that a fight broke out between the two inmates after midnight and Lawlor was strangled. A reason for the row is not yet known.</p>

      <p>“A full investigation into the incident will now take place but there’s no rhyme or reason as to why it started yet.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman from the Irish Prison Service said: “All practicable measures are taken by management and staff to ensure the safety of those in custody. </p>
      <p>“However, regrettably no prison system can be completely free of violence and inter-prisoner assaults do occur.” </p>
      <p>A Garda spokesman added: “Gardai are following a definite line of inquiry and the investigation is ongoing.”</p>
