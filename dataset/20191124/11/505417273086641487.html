        <b>Troy Parrott continues to be linked with a move to the Bundesliga.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/soccer-news/borussia-dortmund-join-transfer-race-20946777">The Mirror</a>, Borussia Dortmund are interested in signing the Ireland and Tottenham Hotspur forward, who doesn’t turn 18 until February.</p>
      <p><a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/bayern-munich-troy-parrott/">Bayern Munich</a> are also said to be monitoring his progress. While <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7719957/Borussia-Dortmund-prepare-highly-rated-Tottenham-starlet-Troy-Parrott.html">The Daily Mail</a> have reported that Juventus and Real Madrid are interested in signing Parrott.</p>

      <p>German clubs have looked to Premier League clubs for untapped potential in recent seasons, identifying talented players who have found first-team opportunities limited.</p>
      <p>Dortmund struck gold when they signed Jadon Sancho from Manchester City in 2017 for just £8m. Sancho is now an England international and one of the top-rated prospects in European football, expected to command a transfer fee of over £100m if he leaves Dortmund. While RB Leipzig signed Ademola Lookman from Everton on a permanent deal last summer after the forward excelled during a loan move with the Bundesliga side.</p>
      <p>Parrott could be the latest Premier League talent to move to Germany in search of first-team football.</p>

      <p>Parrott’s path to the Spurs first-team appeared to become more difficult earlier this week. On the night he scored against Sweden Under-21s at Tallaght Stadium, Tottenham sacked Mauricio Pochettino. The next morning, Jose Mourinho was appointed Spurs manager and the Portuguese coach is not renowned for giving young players first-team opportunities.</p>
      <p>Mourinho said he would promote young players if he felt they were ready for Tottenham’s first-team. However, actions will speak louder than words. Mick McCarthy seems sceptical about Parrott’s opportunities under the former Manchester United manager. The Ireland manager <a href="https://extra.ie/2019/11/23/sport/soccernews/parrotts-future-spurs-mourinho">said</a> on Friday:</p>
      <blockquote>“Well, he (Mourinho) has come in talking about the academy, So if that’s the case he (Parrott) will be quite pleased, because he will get games. But I bet he [Mourinho] doesn’t know him.”</blockquote>

      <p>Parrott is considered one of the best prospects in British football. The Dubliner has excelled for Stephen Kenny’s Ireland Under-21 side and made his senior international debut against New Zealand earlier this month.</p>
      <p>He has made one senior appearance for Spurs – an EFL Cup tie against Colchester United in September – and has been a star performer for the club’s Under-23 side, scoring regularly in the Uefa Youth League. It appears only a matter of time – whether at Tottenham or another club – before he is playing regularly. He certainly has time on his side and won’t be short of options should he decide to make the move from White Hart Lane.</p>
