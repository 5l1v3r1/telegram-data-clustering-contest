      <p>Match Of The Day pundit Ian and EastEnders actress Jacqueline Jossa were chosen by viewers to do the Crevice of Cruelty task.</p>
      <p>Poor Jac, 27, was left sobbing at the news she would be going yet another trial, but in a preview clip she appeared to cope the best of the pair of them.</p>
      <p>She is shown cheering her campmate's football chant in encouragement, singing: "Ian Wright Wright Wright" as creepy-crawlies swarm in the waters around them.</p>
      <p>Ian, 56, is shown clawing at two of the yellow stars they were tasked with collecting, which are lodged behind a grate.</p>

      <p>He bawls: "How do I get these out? Mummy! Mum! Muuuuum!"</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Jac tells him: "I don't want to be in here. Please please please."</p>
      <p>As always, the more stars the pair can collect in the trial, the more food is available for the hungry celebrities at dinner.</p>
