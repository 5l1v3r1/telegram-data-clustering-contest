      <p>Abu Ogogo says not celebrating his last-minute winner in Bristol Rovers' dramatic 4-3 win over Shrewsbury Town was one of the hardest things he has had to do in football.</p>
      <p>For a man who has become a cult hero at Rovers thanks to how wildly he celebrates every single goal, it is a measure of the respect he has to former club Shrewsbury that he managed to restrain himself when <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/shrewsbury-town-boss-accuses-bristol-3572188">the ball hit the back of the net in the 87th minute</a>.</p>
      <p>Ogogo spent three years at New Meadow, captaining them to the League One play-off final two seasons ago, and the midfielder admits it was difficult to keep his emotions in check when he scored.</p>
      <p>"It's one of the hardest things I've had to do," he laughed.</p>

      <p>"Normally when we score I love to celebrate and go wild, especially a last-minute winner like that.</p>
      <p>"Any other game and I would have stripped off and jumped in with the fans!</p>
      <p>"Obviously I couldn't today but it was really hard to keep my emotions in check."</p>
      <p>The Gas were leading 3-1 before two goals in six minutes saw them pegged back to 3-3 in a feisty encounter in Shropshire.</p>
      <p>Ironically, Ogogo's first thought at 3-3 was to make sure they managed to secure at least a point on their travels, but then Liam Sercombe teed him up for a curled finish from 12 yards late on.</p>

      <p>He said: "When it got to 3-3, I said to make sure we didn't lose the game.</p>
      <p>"A point wasn't the worst result so I said to make sure we didn't lose, but luckily we managed to go up the other end and score so I was buzzing with that.</p>
      <p>"The distance between me and Sercs was a little too close so I knew I didn't have time.</p>
      <p>"He set it perfectly and I knew I didn't have time to take a touch so I just used the defender's body and bent it round him."</p>
      <p>He added: "I wanted to celebrate and go wild but obviously I've been here for three years so I didn't out of respect.</p>
      <p>"It was so hard not to.</p>
      <p>The victory moves Rovers to ninth in the table, just one point off the play-off places, and Ogogo can see similarities between the Gas this season and the Shrewsbury team he reached Wembley with two years ago.</p>
      <p>He said: "It's similar to the season under Paul Hurst when we got to the play-off final and the EFL Trophy final.</p>
      <p>"There's similar things happening this season to what was happening then.</p>
      <p>"So hopefully we can do as well this season as we did then."</p>
