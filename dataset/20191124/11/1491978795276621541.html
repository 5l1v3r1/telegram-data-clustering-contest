      <h1>Jon Rahm set to follow idol Seve Ballesteros and become Europe's No 1</h1>

        <i>• Spaniard poised to be crowned Europe’s No 1<br/>• Mike Lorenzo-Vera lies second in Dubai</i>
      </p>
      <p>There will be no breach of the Trades Descriptions Act as the Race to Dubai hurtles towards its conclusion. A delicately poised DP World Tour Championship perfectly reflects the European Tour’s order of merit with just 18 holes of the season remaining.</p>
      <p>Saturday belonged to Jon Rahm, who not only reeled in the previously untouchable Mike Lorenzo-Vera at the summit of the leaderboard but found himself at the top of the Race to Dubai projections as a consequence. Rahm would become only the second Spaniard – after the late, great Seve Ballesteros – to be crowned Europe’s No 1 should he see off all chasers in round four.</p>
      <p>“It gives me goosebumps to think about that,” Rahm said. “I’ve said it many times, as a Spanish player, as a Spaniard, any time you have the chance to put your name on a list where there’s only one name and that name is Seve, it’s pretty impactful. It’s really emotional for all of us.</p>
      <p>“To think not even Sergio [García] or Miguel Ángel [Jiménez] or Ollie [José María Olazábal] or many other great players could get it done? It’s hard to believe that I have the chance to be the second.”</p>
      <p>He has a chance all right. On an afternoon which was long dominated by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rory-mcilroy">Rory McIlroy</a>, Rahm played the inward half in 32 before signing for his second 66 of the week. Lorenzo-Vera’s bogey at the last ensured a tie with Rahm at 15 under par. Soon the Frenchman was making social-media waves after casually throwing in the f-word during a televised post‑round interview. “I’m French,” was his nonchalant explanation for the accidental profanity.</p>
      <p>“Maybe tomorrow you shoot six under and then you put your family out of any trouble for the rest of your life,” said Lorenzo‑Vera, who has never won on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/european-tour">European Tour</a>. “So of course it’s going to add some pressure. But you don’t control anything except your mind. That’s the only thing you can control tomorrow, so I just hope for the same game plan and let’s see if golf wants to give me something.”</p>
      <p>Tommy Fleetwood, who is also in the Race to Dubai hunt, made a 70 to lie four behind Rahm and Lorenzo‑Vera. This marks the third year in a row Fleetwood has taken to day four in Dubai with order of merit hope; he took the title in 2017. “I’m obviously used to this situation and that’s a positive,” said the Southport man. “I’ve got all the experience, so I’ve got to hit golf shots now. That’s what I’m trying to do.”</p>
      <p>McIlroy described golf as a fickle business after his round-two score was 10 shots worse than his opening effort. He pretty much endorsed the point with a day three 65, which leaves him as a clear and obvious threat at minus 13. McIlroy was out in 31 and did not drop a single shot during his third round.</p>
      <p>Should McIlroy prevail at the Earth Course, it would be the first time he had won a tournament at the same venue three times.</p>
      <p>“That would be a nice box to tick,” he said. “It is nice to come back to courses that you’re familiar with all the time, and that brings its own advantages, I guess, compared to maybe some of the other guys in the field. It’s been a great year so far and this is my last event of the year. It would be wonderful going into the break to finish on a high.”</p>
      <p>Bernd Wiesberger, who arrived in the Middle East as the Race to Dubai leader, slipped to a 73 which leaves him in a share of 24th. Shane Lowry has recovered admirably from being over par at the end of day one; subsequent rounds of 68 and 70 means the Open champion shares 11th at five under.</p>
