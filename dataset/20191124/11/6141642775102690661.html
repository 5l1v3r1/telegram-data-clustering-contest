      <p>Curious shoppers browsing Brighton’s winding lanes have been peering in the windows of a tiny pop-up store, eager to catch a glimpse of the strange scene taking shape inside.</p>
      <p>This festive season, more than 40 urban artists have covered train carriages, railway signs and brick buildings in graffiti – and yet it all fits into a tiny store in Dukes Lane.</p>
      <p>Big names in the urban art scene – including Goldie and Maxim from The Prodigy – have each contributed colourful and often political pieces, most of which fit in the palm of your hand.</p>
      <blockquote>The exhibition aims to reflect a microcosm of urban life and celebrate the raw talent of so many talented artists whom typically work on a much larger scale<cite>Pam Glew</cite></blockquote>
      <p>The one-of-a-kind exhibition in the East Sussex city is the brainchild of Pam Glew and Emily Paxton, who sent each artist one piece of a model train set and asked them to make it their own.</p>
      <p>Brought together, the unique hand-painted pieces form a dystopian diorama featuring everything from a love train and Tesco to a Ronald McDonald sign saying “You’re going to die”.</p>
      <p>Ms Clew, one of the curators, said: “The exhibition aims to reflect a microcosm of urban life and celebrate the raw talent of so many talented artists whom typically work on a much larger scale.</p>
      <p>“It’s aiming to have these big ideas on a teeny-weeny shop in Brighton.</p>
      <p>“The exhibition shrinks everything down to a micro scale, simultaneously encouraging the viewer to look even more closely at the tiny details of urban life.”</p>

      <p>More than forty urban artists have contributed to Urban Miniatures, including Australian pop surrealist Ben Frost, real-life train-writer Remi Rough, street art stalwart Pure Evil, political painter and Dismaland star Tinsel Edwards and local boy Eelus – Brighton’s own international muralist.</p>
      <p>Also starring in the gallery is pioneering musician Goldie, who painted a model rail carriage and turned it into a love train.</p>
      <p>Another famous name represented in miniature is Maxim, vocalist for Essex electronic dance music giants The Prodigy, who painted a high-rise building.</p>
      <p>Ms Paxton, fellow curator for the pioneering show, said: “Graffiti doesn’t have to be this negative thing, it can be really positive.”</p>

      <p>South London street artist Remi Rough said: “It was a bit of a challenge to paint something so small and make it look big, but I got there in the end I think.”</p>
      <p>The Urban Miniatures gallery and shop offers other original artworks, limited edition prints and designer gifts by each of the contributing artists, which will also be available online.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, miniature-themed workshops including wreath-making, terrarium-making, cyanotype and furoshiki gift wrapping with block print will be offered by the curators.</p>
      <p>The pop-up launched on Saturday and will run until December 22.</p>
