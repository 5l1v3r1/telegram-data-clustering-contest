      <p>Twenty-three bodies were recovered on Sunday after a small plane crashed on takeoff into a densely populated area of Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, rescue workers said.</p>
      <p>“We are up to 23 bodies now,” Goma rescue service coordinator Joseph Makundi told AFP.</p>
      <p>Goma airport official Richard Mangolopa told AFP no survivors were expected from the disaster.</p>
      <p>The Dornier-228 aircraft had been headed for Beni, 350 kilometres (220 miles) north of Goma when it went down in a residential area near the airport in the east of the country.</p>
      <p>“There were 17 passengers on board and two crew members. It took off around 9-9.10 am (0700 GMT),” Busy Bee airline staff member Heritier Said Mamadou said.</p>
      <p>Busy Bee, a recent company, has three planes serving routes in North Kivu province.</p>
      <p>One of the company’s maintenance workers at the site reportedly blamed a “technical problem” for the crash.</p>
