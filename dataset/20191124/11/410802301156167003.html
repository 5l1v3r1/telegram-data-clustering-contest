      <p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveils his Conservative Party’s manifesto on Sunday, pledging to move on from Brexit and austerity in a bid to secure a general election majority.</p>
      <p>Having taken over a minority administration in July and been unable to speed his EU divorce deal through parliament, Johnson is seeking a clear victory at the December 12 snap election.</p>
      <p>He sees Britain’s third general election in four-and-a-half years as the only way to break the Brexit logjam.</p>
      <p>Having got the Brexit date delayed three months from October 31 to January 31, opposition parties backed his call for an early general election.</p>
      <p>Johnson is promising to bring back his Brexit deal to parliament before December 25 if the centre-right Conservatives are returned to power.</p>
      <p>“As families sit down to carve up their turkeys this Christmas, I want them to enjoy their festive-season free from the seemingly unending Brexit box-set drama,” Johnson said ahead of the launch.</p>
      <p>“The Conservative manifesto, which I’m proud to launch today, will get Brexit done and allow us to move on and unleash the potential of the whole country,” he said.</p>
      <h3>‘Oven-ready’ Brexit deal</h3>
      <p>The main plank of the Conservative manifesto is the Brexit deal Johnson negotiated with Brussels in October. He claims the treaty is “oven-ready” and good to go — as long as he can get a majority.</p>
      <p>He insists the deal will allow Britain to regain control over its laws, money and immigration policy.</p>
      <p>Johnson’s chief rival, left-wing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, wants to renegotiate a new, softer Brexit agreement within three months and then put that to a referendum alongside remaining in the EU by the end of June. Corbyn would stay neutral during the process.</p>
      <p>Johnson has blasted Corbyn for his strategy in refusing to recommend either his own proposed Brexit deal or staying in the EU.</p>
      <p>Johnson tweeted: “It’s time to turn the page from the dither, delay and division of recent years, and start a new chapter in the incredible history of this country.</p>
      <p>“We have achieved amazing things together in the past, and I know we will achieve even more in the future — if only we choose the right path at this critical election.”</p>
      <p>The party is pledging it will not raise the three main taxes — income tax, sales tax and national insurance contributions to state benefits — in what it branded a triple tax lock.</p>
      <p>Other measures being unveiled Sunday include more money for childcare support, energy efficiency measures, skills retraining and road upgrades.</p>
      <p>Hospital car parking charges would be axed for certain patients and National Health Service (NHS) staff.</p>
      <h3>Poll lead</h3>
      <p>The Britain Elects poll aggregator puts the Conservatives on 42 percent, ahead of the Labour main opposition on 29 percent, the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats on 15 percent, the Brexit Party on six percent and the Greens on three percent.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives have seen their popularity surge since Johnson took over from Theresa May four months ago.</p>
      <p>Despite the poll advantage, commentators urge caution, mindful that May had a huge percentage lead in the 2017 general election which rapidly melted.</p>
      <p>Johnson has his weak spots, especially after the years of austerity imposed by Conservative governments since 2010.</p>
      <p>He promises to end the years of reining in the budget deficit by pumping billions of pounds into public services.</p>
      <p>Johnson has pledged to make the streets safer by recruiting 20,000 police officers.</p>
      <p>He is also committed to increasing the NHS budget by £33.9 billion ($43.5 billion, 39.5 billion euros) by 2023-24, and has pledged to upgrade 20 hospitals and rebuild 40 over the next decade.</p>
      <p>Johnson was criticised by members of the public during a televised questions session on Friday over the Conservatives’ handling of the NHS — but he insisted progress could only be made once the Brexit impasse is resolved.</p>
      <p>Johnson has announced a three-year plan to increase state-school spending in England by £7.1 billion by 2022-23.</p>
      <p>On immigration, he wants to end freedom of movement for EU citizens and introduce an Australian-style points-based system.</p>
      <p>The scale of eastern European immigration since 2004 was one of the key factors behind the Brexit referendum vote in 2016.</p>
