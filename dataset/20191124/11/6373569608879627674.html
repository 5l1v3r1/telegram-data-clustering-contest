      <h1>Fire crews called to block of flats in Barne Barton</h1>
      <h2>Four fire engines were seen at Talbot Gardens</h2>

      <p>The fire service was called to a block of flats in Barne Barton this morning after an alarm was heard sounding.</p>
      <p>Four fire engines were seen outside the homes on Talbot Gardens and residents were evacuated from the building just after 10am.</p>
      <p>Concerned residents contacted Plymouth Live but Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service has since confirmed that on arrival there was no sign of a fire.</p>
      <p>Eyewitness Adam Lowther told Plymouth Live: "There's four fire engines in attendance at a block in Barne Barton again, at the end of Talbot Gardens.</p>

      <p>"Residents have been evacuated from the end block.</p>
      <p>"I couldnâ€™t see any fire but it's scary when four trucks turn up."</p>
      <p>A Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson said: "We sent four appliances to Talbot Gardens but it turned out to be a false alarm."</p>
      <p>Last year, <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/plymouth-barne-barton-fire-probe-1976678">a horrendous arson attack on a six-story block in Barne Barton</a> put dozens of lives at risk.</p>
      <p>Eleven families, around 30 residents, were unable to return to their homes due to the damage caused on nearby Savage Road.</p>

      <p>Months later neighbours at a nearby surviving post-war Sanctuary Housing towers off Savage Road claimed their stairwells flood like 'Niagara Falls' and water regularly pours through ceilings, walls, bathrooms and kitchens, leaving them with no electricity or hot water.</p>
      <p>Sanctuary bosses said were committed to improving life on the estate - but admitted things could be better and say fly-tippers are hampering progress on a planned programme of works.</p>
