      <p>CAIRO: One of the armed groups fighting for control of Libya’s capital says it is imposing a “no-fly zone” there.<br/>The self-styled Libyan National Army’s announcement comes after two unmanned drone aircraft — one American and one Italian — were lost near the capital last week.<br/>The LNA has said it shot down the Italian drone, while the US military hasn’t given a reason for its drone’s loss.<br/>Ahmed Al-Mosmari, an LNA spokesman, said late Saturday that all flights over Tripoli and nearby towns are “prohibited without prior coordination.”<br/>Oil-rich Libya is split between rival governments. A UN-supported but weak administration holds the capital, Tripoli. The LNA is allied with the government based in the country’s east.<br/>The LNA has been trying to capture Tripoli since April.</p>
