      <p>Tamar Braxton has decided to jump in the fight between <i>Real Housewives Of Atlanta</i> star Porsha Williams and Loni Love, and not many people are surprised.</p>
      <p>It all started on the most recent episode of The Real<i>, where Loni decided to talk about Porsha’ fiancé, Dennis McKinley.</i></p>
      <p>Loni was talking about the fact that Porsha decided to get back with Dennis after he confessed to cheating when she made this comment: “Let me tell you something, Porsha trying to get that reality show,”</p>
      <p>Adrienne Bailon also shared: “I couldn’t do it, but I’m not going to judge someone else for the way they choose to live their life or decisions she’s going to make.”</p>
      <p>An upset Porsha hit back with: “B*tch F you! #FakeAss don’t run up smiling when I see you!”</p>
      <p>Loni tried to walk back the comments: “Porsha… I didn’t say anything bad about you know it…it was a lighthearted comment. I hope you get your show! #comic.”</p>

      <p>Tamar joined in by sharing a pair of emojis to let the world know that she is here for all of this.</p>
      <p>One person said this: “lmao &amp; they said Tamar was the problem I beg to differ 😂.”</p>
      <p>Another viewer shared: “Tamar was right about Loni 😒I hope they all go to church tomorrow.”</p>
      <p>This social media user revealed: “She not lying tho. Porsha insecure cause she knows it’s the truth 🤷🏽‍♀️. I don’t think Loni said anything wrong. She’s right. Porsha is definitely trying to get her own show 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️.”</p>
      <p>This commenter had the following to say: “What did she say wrong tho? 😂😂😭 all I heard was “Porsha trying to get her reality show” Loni throws a lot of shade and backpedals and calls it love 😂”</p>
      <p>This follower stated: “Tamar was right. Loni can be slick with her mouth at times, and I’m sure Tamar wasn’t having it 👀 , so they got her outta there.”</p>
      <p>Porsha has previously revealed that she is working things out with Dennis and wants another baby soon.</p>
      <p>She said: “I would also say it’s two-part because right now I’m frustrated watching it because I’m watching it with my fiancé, and we were having such a hard time.”</p>
      <p>She added: “We’re happy, and we’re raising our daughter together. It’s been a long road, one we’re still on. We’re going day by day, rebuilding our relationship and making sure our foundation is where we want it to be to have a strong family.”</p>
      <p>Tamar is a bold woman.</p>
