        <b>- Ski Safari in the Dolomites</b>
      </p>
      <p>This safari is about as far from a savanna as you can get. One possible itinerary offered by luxury tour operator Scott Dunn starts in Venice or Innsbruck, Austria. After a stay in five-star accommodations, you can ski from one family-run rifugio to another in the Dolomites, the mountain range in northern Italy that UNESCO has named a World Heritage site. En route you will enjoy breathtaking views and northern Italian cuisine. It's a good idea to book at least six months in advance. Prices start at $5,000 per person. For information, go to scottdunn.com.</p>
