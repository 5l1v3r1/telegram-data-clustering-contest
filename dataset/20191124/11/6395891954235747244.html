      <p>The boy only identified as Landen, suffered broken arms and legs and significant head trauma after Emmanuel Aranda picked him up and threw him from the third floor. Aranda is serving 19 years in prison for attempted premeditated first-degree murder.</p>
      <p>The family has guarded Landen’s privacy but occasionally updates a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/Landonprayers">GoFundMe page</a>. </p>
      <p>“He is now walking perfectly with even legs, amen. The wound has finally scabbed over and new skin is growing, and we are still optimistic he will be off some of his medications soon,” <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/Landonprayers">the post read</a>. “He loves being back to school and going to kindergarten at the same school his twin brother and sister go to. He gets out of the car every morning happy and blows kisses all the way in.”</p>
      <p>Landen has undergone numerous surgeries and physical therapy sessions for his injuries. <a href="https://www.wftv.com/news/trending-now/boy-thrown-from-mall-of-america-balcony-goes-home-man-accused-of-throwing-him-appeals-conviction/982460421">In September</a>, he finished his inpatient rehabilitation. He is expected to have multiple follow up appointments in December. </p>
      <p>“Landen knows people all over the world are praying for him and he loves all the cards he keeps getting in the mail,” the post read. “His whole family feels the love and are so grateful for the prayers and people like you who care so much about others! There was one bad person, but from that came millions of good people.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wftv.com/news/trending-now/boy-thrown-from-mall-of-america-balcony-making-small-steps-toward-healing/941718300">Aranda had told police</a> that he went to the mall "looking for someone to kill" after years of rejection from women. His mother said Aranda was homeless and had mental health for many years.</p>
