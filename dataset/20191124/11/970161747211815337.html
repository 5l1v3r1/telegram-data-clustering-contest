      <p>Paul Scholes says <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/frank-lampard/">Frank Lampard</a> will be frustrated with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a>’s inability to convert good performances into wins against the top sides and questioned the team’s centre-back partnership.</p>
      <p>The west Londoners gave another strong showing away to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> on Saturday evening, taking the lead through N’Golo Kante, but ultimately succumbed to a disappointing 2-1 defeat.</p>
      <p>Chelsea have made a habit of playing well without winning against their rivals and Scholes believes they need to start grinding out victories, while he feels Fikayo Tomori and Kurt Zouma contributed to a nervousness at the back.</p>

      <p>‘They keep going to these big clubs, playing really well and not winning games. That will be frustrating for him I think, because he knows he’s got quality in his team but he’s missing something,’ Scholes told the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a>.</p>

      <p>‘He’s definitely missing something. He went to Manchester United, everyone said Chelsea were the best team, played really well, got beat 4-0. Played against Liverpool, played okay I don’t think they were anything great against Liverpool, got beat.</p>
      <p>‘Played against Manchester City, everyone’s saying the best team, they were really good, they played well, they’ve lost the game. Now he has to find a way of changing that.</p>
      <p>‘There’s no point coming away from these games saying you played really well but lost. Big teams win leagues through going to Manchester City, maybe not playing that well, but nicking a 1-0.</p>
      <p>‘Like Manchester City have done today – not played very well but they’ve come away winning the game. That will be frustrating for him, he knows he’s got a good team.</p>

      <p>‘I’d be a little bit worried about his two centre-halves, the way he wants to play are they good enough on the ball?</p>
      <p>‘I think defensively they’re okay but they look a bit nervous on the ball to me, which can create nerves throughout the team.</p>
      <p>‘Are they a centre-forward short? We know they’re missing Eden Hazard from last year, who’s a big difference we know that, he’s got the quality in these big games to win them. [Lampard’s] got a really good team, but he’s got to find that way of winning in big games, and that will frustrate him for now.’</p>
