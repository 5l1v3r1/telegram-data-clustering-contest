      <p>A group of mostly youths, armed with machetes, arrived at a Birmingham cinema on Saturday night, breaking out into fights. Armed police were called to the scene of the fight, in which police officers were assaulted and several arrests were made.</p>
      <p>According to witnesses, the mayhem broke out over the release of <i>Blue Story</i>, a film which depicts gang culture in southeast London.</p>
      <p>“That’s probably one of the scariest moments of my life. Me and my daughter were in a queue to watch <i>Frozen</i>, loads of little kids there, all dressed up and everything, then these girls jumped on another girl and loads of these kids just started fighting,” one witness <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-birmingham-star-city-incident-20945783">told</a> <i>The Mirror</i>.</p>
      <p>“Armed police came with Tasers. All the people that were fighting run off into the cinema. There’s about 15 to 20 police cars. I’m shaking,” the witness added.</p>
      <p>“This is the most horrifying thing I’ve been involved in. I’m scared and I’m 45. [There were] little girls dressed in <i>Frozen</i> dresses crying and screaming. Appalling behaviour all over a gangster film set in London,” another witness said.</p>

      <p>Police arrived at the entertainment centre after reports of armed youths roaming the cinema with machetes poured in.</p>
      <p>“A number of arrests have been made following disorder at Star City in Birmingham tonight.</p>
      <p>“We were called just before 5.35 pm to reports that a group of people with machetes had arrived at the cinema within the complex.</p>
      <p>“Officers arrived to find a group of more than 100 people, and pockets of fighting broke out as police moved to clear the area. A number of police officers have been assaulted, and several arrests have been made,” a spokesman for West Midlands Police said.</p>
      <p>The BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-50536472">reports</a> that five of the arrests were of teenagers. One 13-year-old girl, a boy and a girl both aged 14, and a 19-year-old male were held on suspicion of assaulting police while a 14-year-old boy was held on suspicion of obstructing police.</p>
      <p>On Friday evening, two people were also arrested in neighbouring Wolverhampton, after a man was attacked with a machete and an ‘imitation’ fire-arm, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/arrests-firearm-seized-after-machete-17304550">reports</a> the <i>Birmingham Mail</i>. One man aged 29 and a 31-year-old woman were arrested; the victim thankfully only suffered minor injuries to his hand.</p>
