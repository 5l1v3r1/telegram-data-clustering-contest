      <h1>Banishing cruel bogus callers is a team effort</h1>
      <h2>Protecting our pensioners froom doorstep conmen is a priority for the authorities working with the Express.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:55:18+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author">Carla Talbot, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/carla-talbot/</a></address>
      <p>The Paisley Daily Express teamed up with Roar and Police Scotland to help promote our campaign to protect pensioners from bogus crime.</p>
      <p>As part of the Your Home, Your Street, Our Community initiative, the Express joined a number of organisations at a community safety event in The Piazza to give out stickers for the Protect Our Pensioners campaign.</p>
      <p>Alongside Roar - Connections for Life, which was promoting safety in the community for the elderly, the Express handed out the stickers to remind people how to remain safe when dealing with bogus callers.</p>
      <p>The bright and informative labels have already been handed out at other community events and are set to be distributed to hundreds of pensioners in the community.</p>
      <p>The stickers give tips for people who may be unsure of anyone at their door and urges them to call the police if they feel scared or threatened.</p>
      <p>The stickers also include our Nominate a Neighbour scheme, which encourages OAPs to write details of someone they trust who they can contact if someone they don’t know comes to their door.</p>
      <p>The stickers campaign has been backed by Renfrewshire police.</p>
      <p>Officers attended the event, which was organised as part of the Renfrewshire Safer Communities Partnership, and highlighted the work being done to help make Renfrewshire safer.</p>
      <p>PC Martin Cook, said: “We are working hard to address the issues affecting our community to make Paisley a safer and more attractive place to live and work.</p>
      <p>“We are now working hard on issues affecting our communities and in the coming weeks.”</p>
      <p>As part of their efforts to keep communities safer, officers will also be hosting a financial harm event, along with the Royal Bank of Scotland, on Monday.</p>
      <p>PC Cook added: “We are very pleased to be working closely with the The Royal Bank of Scotland and other stakeholders in a combined effort to help vulnerable adults.</p>
      <p>“We are working with our partners to provide a free drop-in service.</p>
      <p>“We also recognise that when some elderly have been targeted by doorstep criminals, much of this is not reported.</p>
      <p>“We would encourage everyone to remain vigilant and report suspicious activity via 101 or, in the case of an emergency, 999.”</p>
