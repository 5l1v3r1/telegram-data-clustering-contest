      <h1>How to use Adoptable Storage on the NVIDIA Shield TV (2019) [VIDEO]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T11:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/mweinbach/" target="_blank">Max Weinbach</a></address>
      <p>The NVIDIA Shield TV (streaming stick) is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/nvidia-shield-tv-pro-shield-tv-stick-announced/">one of the best Android TV devices</a> on the market. It has 4K AI upscaling with Dolby Vision along with NVIDIA’s own gaming apps. One of the only big issues with the new Shield TV is its storage capacity. It only has 8GB of storage, which NVIDIA says is enough for “50-70 streaming apps,” but for some people, this isn’t enough. Luckily, NVIDIA included a microSD card slot to expand the storage.</p>
      <p>In this video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xdadevelopers">XDA TV’s</a> TK Bay shows you how to enable adoptable storage on the NVIDIA Shield TV to get more usable storage for apps and games. It’s as simple as selecting the right setting. You will need a compatible microSD card like the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/i/193172073442?chn=ps&amp;var=493362434974&amp;norover=1&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-117182-37290-0&amp;mkcid=2&amp;itemid=493362434974_193172073442&amp;targetid=474173459989&amp;device=m&amp;mktype=pla&amp;googleloc=9031179&amp;campaignid=6470049725&amp;mkgroupid=79220281842&amp;rlsatarget=pla-474173459989&amp;abcId=1141176&amp;merchantid=6296724&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAiNnuBRD3ARIsAM8Kmlv-mR2OKWw42okPT2TPXTq8oNFIA9CqXKr2NxGJZyBbmZuNGWY4taQaAs8WEALw_wcB">Kingston Canvas Select Plus</a>. This lets you have a lot more storage for whatever you might want to put on your NVIDIA Shield TV.</p>

      <p>If you have the Shield TV, all you need to do is go into <b>Settings &gt; Storage</b> and then select your SD card. If it’s compatible, there will be a button that says “format and use as device storage.” Selecting this will enable adoptable storage allowing you to install apps onto the SD Card. Enabling adoptable storage will wipe the drive, but that’s a small inconvenience for a lot more device storage.</p>
