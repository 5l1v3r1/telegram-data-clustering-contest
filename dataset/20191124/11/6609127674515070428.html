        <b>TWO of Scotland's top plastic surgeons are set to battle it out in court over an alleged cocaine slur, according to reports.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scotlands-top-plastic-surgeons-go-20945405">Daily Record</a> claim Dr Darren ­McKeown has ignited legal action against fellow surgeon Dr Simon Ravichandran over an alleged remark made last year at a cosmetic event in London.</p>

      <p>Ravichandran, who specialises in ear, nose and throat surgery, is claimed to have made a comment about McKeown taking cocaine.</p>
      <p>The case is set to begin in Edinburgh's Court of Session on January 29.</p>
      <p>Paperwork in relation to the case will state that McKeown's cosmetic business suffered as a result of the accusation.</p>
      <p>Ravichandran denies saying the drug slur and his legal representatives will argue McKeown has been unable to prove financial loss.</p>
      <p>They will also argue that the case should not be heard in Scotland due to the incident allegedly taking place in London.</p>
      <p>McKeown strongly denies any involvement with drugs.</p>
      <p>He has regularly appeared in interviews discussing cosmetic work celebs have had done.</p>
      <p>It has also been claimed in the past that he paid staff with Louboutin shoes instead of money.</p>
      <p>Both McKeown and Ravichandran have been approached for comment by The Scottish Sun.</p>
