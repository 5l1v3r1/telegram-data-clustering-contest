      <p>LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveils his Conservative Party's manifesto on Sunday (Nov 24), pledging to move on from Brexit and austerity in a bid to secure a general election victory.</p>
      <p>Having taken over a minority administration in July and unable to speed his EU divorce deal through parliament, Johnson is seeking a majority at the Dec 12 snap general election.</p>

      <p>He sees Britain's third general election in four and a half years as the only way to break the logjam on Brexit, which 52 per cent of voters plumped for in the seismic 2016 referendum.</p>
      <p>Having got the Brexit date delayed three months from Oct 31 to Jan 31, opposition parties backed his call for an early general election.</p>
      <p>"I'm looking forward to sharing our manifesto," Johnson tweeted Saturday.</p>
      <p>"We have developed a clear plan that respects the referendum, gets it done, and allows us to move on and focus on delivering real benefits for you and your family," the centre-right party leader said.</p>
      <p>The Britain Elects poll aggregator puts the Conservatives on 42 percent, ahead of the Labour main opposition on 29 per cent, the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats on 15 per cent, the Brexit Party on six per cent and the Greens on three per cent.</p>

      <p>The Conservatives have seen their popularity surge since Johnson took over from Theresa May four months ago.</p>
      <p>They also seem set to benefit from Nigel Farage's Brexit Party pulling out their candidates from more than 300 seats being defended by the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>Parliament's lower House of Commons contains 650 MPs.</p>
      <p>Farage had been accused of risking splitting the pro-Brexit vote and allowing anti-Brexit candidates to win seats, under Britain's first-past-the-post constituencies system.</p>
      <p>Despite the poll lead, the election outcome remains uncertain and commentators call for caution, mindful that May had a huge poll lead in the 2017 general election which rapidly melted.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'OVEN-READY BREXIT DEAL'</b>
      </p>
      <p>The main plank of the Conservative manifesto is the Brexit deal Johnson negotiated with Brussels in October. He claims the treaty is "oven-ready" and good to go -- as long as he can get a majority.</p>
      <p>He insists the deal will allow Britain to regain control over its laws, money and immigration policy.</p>

      <p>Johnson's chief rival, left-wing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, wants to renegotiate a new, softer Brexit agreement within three months and then put that to a referendum alongside remaining in the EU by the end of June. Corbyn would stay neutral during the process.</p>
      <p>Johnson has blasted Corbyn for his strategy in refusing to recommend either his own proposed Brexit deal or staying in the EU.</p>
      <p>However, Johnson has his own weak spots, especially after the years of austerity imposed by Conservative governments since 2010.</p>
      <p>He promises to end the years of reining in the budget deficit by pumping billions of pounds into public services.</p>
      <p>Johnson has pledged to make the streets safer by recruiting 20,000 police officers.</p>
      <p>He is also committed to increasing the National Health Service (NHS) budget by £33.9 billion (US$43.5 billion) by 2023-24, and has pledged to upgrade 20 hospitals and rebuild 40 over the next decade.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives have also said 50 million more appointments in family doctors' surgeries will be created every year if they win a majority.</p>
      <p>Johnson was criticised by members of the public during a televised questions session on Friday over the Conservatives' handling of the NHS - but he insisted progress could only be made once the Brexit impasse is resolved.</p>
      <p>Johnson has announced a three-year plan to increase state-school spending in England by £7.1 billion by 2022-23.</p>
      <p>On immigration, he wants to end freedom of movement for EU citizens and introduce an Australian-style points-based system.</p>
      <p>The scale of eastern European immigration since 2004 was one of the key factors behind the Brexit vote in 2016.</p>
