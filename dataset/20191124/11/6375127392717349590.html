      <h3>PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte apologized Sunday for believing “false news” that Vice President Leni Robredo invited a foreign rights advocate who suggested on Twitter to arrest him for “inciting and instigating mass murder.”</h3>
      <p>“I am sorry because I said you only realize that it is false news when the news comes out. And you hear it and you talk about it, you react to it, that is the problem,” Duterte told reporters in Davao City.</p>
      <p>Duterte previously lashed out at Physicians for Human Rights director Phelim Kine and threatened to slap him in front of Robredo. He also mistakenly referred to him as a prosecutor.</p>
      <p>Robredo, who Duterte appointed to co-chair the Inter-agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs (ICAD) three weeks ago, has denied inviting Kine to the Philippines, dismissing as “fake news” reports that suggested she did.</p>
      <p>This, along with her meetings with foreign bodies on the drug war, are cited as the reasons behind Duterte’s reversal on giving Robredo a Cabinet post to oversee the government’s campaign against drugs.</p>
      <p>Robredo has said that she is unfazed at not getting a Cabinet post and would rather focus on her work, even if Malacañang has yet to give her a detailed description of what her job actually entails.</p>
      <p>Robredo has written to Duterte asking him for specifics on her position after some ICAD members resisted giving her a copy of the list of high-value drug targets. She said the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency has offered to give her a briefing on the list, but refused pending clarification on her role from Malacañang.</p>
      <p>Duterte, however, said the executive order that created the ICAD should be enough.</p>
      <p>“It’s there in the law, it’s there in the executive order creating itongICAD … Nandiyan ‘yan.So basahin lang niya ‘yan,it’s all there and that is where she would really exercise ‘yung — kung mayroon,” he said.                                        (Translation: It’s there in the law, it’s there in the executive order creating the ICAD … It’s there. So she should just read it, it’s all there and that is where she would see what powers she could really exercise.)</p>
      <p>Executive Order No. 15, which created the ICAD, does not provide for a co-chair post. It only says that the ICAD chairperson “shall have the overall responsibility to ensure that the objectives of the ICAD and the clusters herein created are accomplished.”</p>
