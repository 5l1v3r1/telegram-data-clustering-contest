      <p>Little Mix will headline their own day at the British Summer Time festival next year.</p>
      <p>The pop group – Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Jade Thirlwall and Perrie Edwards – announced the news in a video on their shared Twitter page.</p>
      <p>Nelson said: “We have some huge news that we are so excited about, that we want to share with you guys.</p>

      <p>“We are heading back on the road next year for our summer 2020 tour. This will include a date playing the legendary American Express Presents BST Hyde Park in London.”</p>
      <p>The band did not confirm which date they will perform.</p>
      <p>The former X Factor stars supported Sir Tom Jones at the event in London’s Hyde Park in 2014.</p>
      <p>It comes after they cancelled a string of tour dates in Australia and New Zealand to ensure they have time to record their sixth album.</p>

      <p>They have also recently been at loggerheads with Simon Cowell, who signed them to his Syco record label after they won the X Factor in 2011.</p>
      <p>However, the music mogul and Little Mix parted ways last year.</p>
      <p>Cowell recently announced that he is launching a new version of the X Factor, called The Band, to rival the girl group’s upcoming BBC One talent show, called The Search.</p>
      <p>Tickets go on sale on November 28.</p>
