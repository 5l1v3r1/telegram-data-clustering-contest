      <p>Good luck throwing the ball today, Cowboys and Patriots. The weather for this afternoon’s game between Dallas and New England looks downright nasty.</p>
      <p>Gillette Stadium is a cold, rainy, windy hellscape today.</p>
      <p>Bad weather is expected all afternoon long. The Cowboys and the Patriots better have their running games ready.</p>
      <p>It’s a brutal scene in Foxborough right now:</p>

      <p>The Cowboys have been looking to get Ezekiel Elliott going in recent weeks. They’ll likely need him running at an elite level this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Dallas and New England are set to kick off at 4:25 p.m. E.T.</p>
      <p>The game will be on FOX.</p>
