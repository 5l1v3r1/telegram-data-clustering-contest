      <h1>Oilers’ Ryan Nugent-Hopkins to miss at least two games with hand injury</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:43:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/author/sportsnet-staff/" target="_blank">Sportsnet Staff</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/teams/edmonton-oilers/">Edmonton Oilers</a> will be without centre <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/players/ryan-nugent-hopkins/600075">Ryan Nugent-Hopkins</a> for at least two games — including Sunday’s clash against the Arizona Coyotes — due to a hand injury.</p>

      <p>Sam Gagner <a href="https://twitter.com/EdmontonJack/status/1198761179935629312">will replace</a> Nugent-Hopkins in the lineup against the Coyotes, according to Oilers play-by-play announcer Jack Michaels.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear when Nugent-Hopkins suffered the injury. He skated more than 18 minutes during Saturday’s win over the Vegas Golden Knights and picked up one assist.</p>
      <p>Nugent-Hopkins has 16 points in 25 games this season.</p>
