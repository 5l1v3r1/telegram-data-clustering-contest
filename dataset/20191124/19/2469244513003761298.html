      <p>A man has lashed out at a Stagecoach driver after he reportedly refused to stop his bus when a passenger went into cardiac arrest.</p>
      <p>Passenger Steve McIntosh said the emergency happened on a bus heading from the Sowton green park and ride stop into town on Friday November 15 just after lunch.</p>
      <p>He said the man keeled off his seat and his heart stopped beating, but the driver allegedly refused to stop the bus so Steve or his colleague he was travelling with could administer first aid.</p>
      <p>It apparently also made it harder for them to tell ambulance crews exactly where they were.</p>
      <p>When the bus eventually stopped on Haven Road, one of the passengers performed CPR while another ran to fetch a defibrillator from a nearby leisure centre.</p>
      <p>The ambulance service then arrived and treated the man at the scene before taking him to hospital.</p>
      <p>"It's a f***ing disgrace, if you'll excuse my language," said Steve.</p>
      <p>"The guy got on the bus and within five minutes he had fallen over in a heap. My colleague sat him up straight, checked his vital signs and made sure he was breathing, but he quickly deteriorated.</p>
      <p>"I asked the bus driver to stop on Fore Street but he refused. I asked him numerous times but he said no.</p>
      <p>"I asked if he could radio in asking for medical assistance and again he said no as he was not allowed to. He only seemed interested in getting to his bus stop in time.</p>
      <p>"I performed CPR on the guy for a long time until the ambulance turned up. My colleague ran across the road into the leisure centre to grab a defibrillator. While he was gone, I was doing chest compressions - it was harrowing.</p>
      <p>"The paramedics arrived, shouted 'clear' and shocked him. They were working on him for a good 25 minutes before they took him off the bus."</p>
      <p>The ambulance service confirmed that they attended an incident but were unable to release details.</p>
      <p>A statement said: "South Western Ambulance Service were called on Friday at 2.12pm about a medical incident at a bus stop on Haven Road, Exeter.</p>
      <p>"Our ambulance crews treated an adult male patient at the scene and transported him to hospital by land ambulance for further care."</p>
      <p>Devon Live has not been given an update on the condition of the man.</p>
      <p>Stagecoach have confirmed that they are investigating the matter.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Stagecoach South West said: “We are currently investigating the incident to establish what happened. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.”</p>
