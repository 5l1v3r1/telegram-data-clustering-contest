      <p>K-pop star Goo Hara had left a heartbreaking message for fellow Korean singer Sulli following her suspected suicide – just as she was found dead on Sunday at the age of 28.</p>
      <p>Sulli, who was a member of girl group f(x), <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/14/k-pop-star-sulli-found-dead-aged-25-10913196/">was found dead</a> at 3.20pm on 14 October after her manager went to her house when he was unable to contact her.</p>
      <p>Paramedics subsequently arrived at 3.39pm, where they found Sulli dead on arrival.</p>
      <p>‘Choi seemed to have lived alone in the house,’ a police official told <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20191014008500315">Yonhap.</a></p>
      <p>‘It seems that she took her own life but we are also looking into other possibilities.’</p>
      <p>Hara and Sulli were close friends, with Hara leaving a heartwrenching message for her late pal on an Instagram livestream, apologising for not being able to attend her funeral as she was in Japan at the time to promote her solo career.</p>

      <p>In the video, Hara can be seen trying to hold the tears back while holding her hands in a prayer symbol, as she promises to work hard for her.</p>
      <p>‘Sulli, I’m sorry I can’t go [to your funeral] because I am in Japan,’ she said.</p>

      <p>‘I’m sorry that I had no other choice but to greet you like this.</p>
      <p>‘Live well up there and do everything that you wanted to do. I will live hard and work hard for you.’</p>
      <p>She later told fans watching the livestream that she and Sulli were ‘like a set of sisters’ due to how close they were.</p>

      <p>It comes after Hara, who was a former member of the girl group Kara, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/k-pop-star-former-kara-member-goo-hara-found-dead-28-11209087/">was found dead</a> in her Cheongsam home on Sunday evening at the age of 28. The cause of her death is currently being investigated.</p>
      <p>Japanese agency Production Ogi released a statement which requested for the star’s privacy.</p>
      <p>‘Hello. We are here to deliver tragic and unfortunate news,’ the statement read.</p>
      <p>‘Family members and friends of Goo Hara are deeply shocked and anxious at the moment.</p>
