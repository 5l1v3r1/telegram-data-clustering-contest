      <h1>Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold fires warning to Premier League title rivals</h1>
      <h2>The Reds are eight points clear at the top of the table and still unbeaten after 13 games following their late winner against Crystal Palace on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:33:07+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:33</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/trent-alexander-arnold">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> has warned Liverpool's Premier League title rivals that nothing can stop the Reds this season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> remain unbeaten and sit top of the table after 13 matches following Saturday's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/crystal-palace-1-2-liverpool-20943665">2-1 win away at Crystal Palace</a> .</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's side looked like they may drop points for only the second time this season when Wilfried Zaha fired in an equaliser with less than 10 minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>But they immediately restored their lead just minutes later when Roberto Firmino stabbed home the winner from inside the box.</p>
      <p>And Alexander-Arnold believes their constant knack of grinding out results has been the key to their impressive start.</p>

      <p>Speaking to the club's <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/374434-trent-alexander-arnold-reaction-crystal-palace">official website</a> , he said: "We have been showing that throughout the course of the season and even last season we showed how much of a good team spirit we have got and resilience.</p>
      <p>“We had a setback with their goal and we bounced back pretty much straight away. We showed our quality and went up the other end and scored.</p>
      <p>“That’s what good teams do, find a way to win, and that’s what we have done.”</p>

      <p>Liverpool have scored a number of late goals this season to seal crucial wins in the title race.</p>
      <p>Two goals in the last seven minutes helped them come from behind to beat Aston Villa three weeks ago, while a James Milner penalty in injury time secured all three points against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> .</p>
      <p>Adam Lallana scored an 85th-minute equaliser against Man Utd, and Divock Origi's last gasp goal sent the Carabao Cup clash with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> to penalties.</p>

      <p>Speaking after the Palace win, boss Klopp said: "Today I have no problem that we were not brilliant because in a game like this you just have to make sure you're ready to fight for the result and we were that from the first minute.</p>
      <p>"Could we have played better? Yes, but we had players on the pitch that were on Thursday morning still on a plane back from Abu Dhabi, where Brazil played. That's not too cool.</p>
      <p>"For that, getting a result at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> , you never take for granted. So, it feels good.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what people will say but I know 37 points after 13 games is exceptional and you cannot have them with winning only brilliant games.</p>
      <p>"We had a couple of really brilliant games but you can't only win them. We are not out there to send messages, we just want to get results."</p>
      <p>Liverpool are next in Premier League action against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> on November 30, before hosting <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> in the season's first Merseyside derby a few days later.</p>
