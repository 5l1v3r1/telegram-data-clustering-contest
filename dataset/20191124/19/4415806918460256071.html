      <p>A brilliant individual goal from Cork woman Clare Shine won Glasgow City the Scottish Women's Cup final today, sealing a thrilling 4-3 win over Hibernian.</p>

      <p>Picking up the ball wide on the Glasgow right in the final minute of normal time, the Republic of Ireland international jinked inside two Hibs defenders before drilling a left-foot shot into the top corner.</p>
