      <p>Nothing like ice magic, some great singing, and Disney money to break some more box office records.</p>
      <p>As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/frozen-2-opening-weekend-china-global-international-box-office-results-1202791912/amp/?__twitter_impression=true">Deadline</a>, <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/there-s-so-much-more-to-love-in-frozen-ii-1839780988"><i>Frozen 2</i></a><i> </i>has jumped past the competitors to cement itself as the largest-opening animated film of all time, grossing a worldwide global debut of $350.2 million. Most of this money, notably, came from the international market, where it raked in $223.2 million across 37 international markets since its opening on Friday.</p>
      <p>In China, the film made $53 million, for the 3rd best animated debut ever and the best Disney animated debut; Korea came in next with $31.5 million and another record as 3rd highest industry opening, period; and behind trailed Japan, Germany, and a bunch of other countries.</p>
      <p>Domestically, the film hit approximately $125 million. Which goes to show: people, around the world, <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-team-behind-frozen-ii-still-marvels-at-the-success-1838021600">really really like</a> <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/deciding-to-make-frozen-ii-was-much-more-complicated-th-1838021422"><i>Frozen</i></a>. While Disney franchises like <i>Star Wars </i>might not be as popular overseas as they are in the States, <i>Frozen </i>is proving a reliable name for the company.</p>
      <p>Oh, and if you want to adjust for inflation, the <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/frozen-ii-revives-box-office-pushes-disney-past-3-billion-in-2019-domestic-grosses/">domestic opening</a> is still fourth ever. <i>The Lion King </i>is still on top in that race. </p>
