      <p><i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/doctor-sleep/">Doctor Sleep</a> </i>has earned the seal of approval from critics and Stephen King himself. Now, director Mike Flanagan wants to take a stab at another horror movie favorite: <i>A</i> <i>Nightmare on Elm Street</i>.</p>
      <p>With the announcement that Wes Craven's estate was taking pitches for a new <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street</i> film, Flanagan took to Twitter to announce his own potential candidacy. He wrote, "Put me in coach...I've got a pitch!"</p>

Since then, the estate has begun to toy with the idea of resurrecting Freddy Krueger for a new film. They announced that they are actively accepting pitches for a reboot, prompting Flanagan to throw his hat in the ring.</p>

      <p>Wes Craven's original 1984 slasher film was a <a href="https://screenrant.com/stephen-king-movies-2019-mixed-year/">huge horror hit</a>, cementing the villainous Freddy Krueger as a horror movie icon. The film told the story of a group of teenagers who lived on the same street in the fictional town of Springwood, Ohio. Freddy Krueger killed the teens in their sleep, thus killing them in real life as well. The film was remade in 2010 to mixed reviews.</p>
      <p>Written and directed by Mike Flanagan, <i>Doctor Sleep</i> stars Ewan McGregor, Rebecca Ferguson, Kyliegh Curran, Carl Lumbly, Alex Essoe and Zahn McClarnon.</p>
