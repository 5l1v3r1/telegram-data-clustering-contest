      <p>More than 1,000 members of the LGBTQ community and their supporters have marched through New Delhi to celebrate sexual diversity, which they say is progressing but still has a long way to go to become a more accepting place for them.</p>
      <p>Carrying rainbow flags, balloons and placards and dancing to the beat of drums, the LGBT supportersÂ demanded self-identification in any gender for legal recognition rather than first registering as a transgender and then providing proof of surgery to authorities, as suggested by a government bill.</p>
      <p>They say the bill, yet to be approved by the Parliament, contradicts a landmark judgment by Supreme Court last year striking down a colonial-era law that made gay sex punishable by up to 10 years in prison.</p>
