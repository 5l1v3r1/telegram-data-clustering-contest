      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/"><b>Arsenal</b></a> chairman Sir <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chips-keswick/"><b>Chips Keswick</b></a> is reportedly considering his future with the club after their <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/arsenal-vs-southampton_game_92626.html">2-2 draw with Southampton</a> at the weekend.</h2>

      <p>The North London club needed a late <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alexandre-lacazette/"><b>Alexandre Lacazette</b></a> equaliser to salvage a point against the struggling Saints on Saturday, a result that extended the Gunners' winless run to six games and heaped more pressure on their beleaguered manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/unai-emery/"><b>Unai Emery</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard faced calls from the Emirates Stadium crowd to resign following another insipid Arsenal display but <i>The Athletic</i> reports that it is the club's chairman who is considering his future.</p>
      <p>Keswick, a lifelong Gunners fan, became chairman in 2013 but he is thought to be so upset by the constant criticism aimed at the club's board that he feels "compelled to consider handing in his resignation."</p>
      <p>His role in the club's day-to-day footballing operations is relatively small, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/edu/"><b>Edu</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/raul-sanllehi/"><b>Raul Sanllehi</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/josh-kroenke/"><b>Josh Kroenke</b></a> among those with much more hands on positions.</p>
