        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/liam-payne/">Liam Payne</a> is clearly a man of many talents, as he revealed his surprise cooking skills this weekend while making Sunday lunch for his girlfriend, Maya Henry, and a group of friends.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Strip That Down singer invited his pals over to his mansion this afternoon for a pool party, and while he has the means to hire an expensive chef and catering company, Liam decided to DIY the Sunday roast.</p>
      <p>And we have to admit, it looked pretty tasty.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram video, Liam is seen chopping carrots and boiling a large pot of potatoes while explaining his cooking process.</p>
      <p>‘We are having a little cheeky pool party at the house,’ he revealed.</p>
      <p>While chopping carrots, he offered some pretty savvy advice, warning: ‘Mind your fingers, don’t try this at home children unless you’re an expert chopper like me and you end up with a nice chopped carrot.’</p>

      <p>With the carrots and potatoes cooking nicely on the hob, it was time to crack open the champagne and it’s safe to say, Liam doesn’t do things by halves.</p>

      <p>In his glass wine store, the popstar brings out a magnum-sized champagne bottle and joked to his friend: ‘It’s medium sized.’</p>
      <p>If that’s what he drinks for a casual Sunday roast, we’d love to see what Liam brings out for a real party.</p>
      <p>‘I reckon I can open it without it going anywhere actually,’ he boasted before impressively managing only a little spill after popping the cork.</p>
      <p>Offering more pearls of wisdom, he then quipped: ‘You’re only as good as your last meal in cooking, I think.’</p>

      <p>Watch out Gordon Ramsay, ‘Chef P’ is in the house.</p>
      <p>In photos from the meal, Maya, 19, is seen sweetly cupping Liam’s face at the dinner table before the group pose for a snap.</p>
      <p>Our Sunday lunch wasn’t nearly as fun.</p>
      <p>Liam and Maya are pretty much inseparable these days, and he recently praised the model for putting a smile on his face.</p>
      <p>The former One Direction singer wrote in a post: ‘Sometimes I don’t recognise this happy guy… sure glad you brought him back though…</p>

      <p>‘Then last but not least this one @maya_henry for always keeping the biggest smile on my face through all the stress and making me realise how perfect my life really is.’</p>
