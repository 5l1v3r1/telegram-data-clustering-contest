      <h1>Aldi shoppers FURIOUS at missing out on Kevin the Carrot toys due to high demand</h1>
      <h2>Some hopeful customers queued online for hours overnight!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:46:46+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:46</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Leigh</a></address>
      <p>Aldi shoppers were left frustrated earlier today as they tried for hours to get their hands on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/kevin-the-carrot-is-back-and-hes-got-a-new-nemesis-in-the-aldi-christmas-ad/">Kevin the Carrot</a> toys.</p>
      <p>Kevin fans queued online overnight to bag the plush dolls of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/kevin-the-carrot-is-back-and-hes-got-a-new-nemesis-in-the-aldi-christmas-ad/">the characters starring in the supermarket's Christmas TV advert</a>, with huge demand thought to have crashed Aldi's website.</p>
      <p>The online frenzy meant the range sold out within hours, reportedly leaving thousands disappointed - including many who either stayed up all night on Saturday night or woke up very early on Sunday morning to stake their claim for the Â£3.99 collectibles.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/">the Mirror's website</a>, an incredible 20,000 hopeful punters were in the online queue at one point.</p>

      <p>One person is quoted as telling the news outlet that they remained in front of a screen to try and buy from midnight until 6am this morning.</p>
      <p>And dozens of other would-be purchasers also complained in real time on social media about their lack of success in securing their very own Kevin.</p>
      <aside>They are all sold out!</aside>
      <p>"Kevin the carrot has sold out ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤," tweeted one unsatisfied customer.</p>
      <p>"Just waited 20 mins to get on Aldi website for Kevin the Carrot and they are completely sold out #scandalous," said another.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Another shopper seethed: "I would of had better luck getting Glastonbury tickets than bloody Kevin the Carrot! Log back in at 7am and they are all sold out!"</p>
      <p>"You should be sorry for not stocking enough Kevin the Carrots online," someone else tweeted at the supermarket's account.</p>
      <p>And another particularly furious person raged: "If you stayed up all night to buy these toys just to put on ebay for inflated prices then you're a [bleep] and I hope every time you leave the house you get [bleep] on by seagulls with explosive diarrhoea ðŸ˜Š #KevinTheCarrot."</p>

      <p>Aldi told customers on social media: "Due to popular demand, Kevin and the rest of the range do tend to sell out quickly.</p>
      <p>"But please don't worry! These characters will also be available to purchase individually in store on Thursday 28th November."</p>
      <p>And a representative for Aldi told ED: "We're sorry that some shoppers were unable to get their hands on these toys online this morning, however, demand has been extremely high.</p>
      <p>"The range will be stocked in-store from 28th November but, as with all of our Specialbuy products, these will also only be available while stocks last."</p>
