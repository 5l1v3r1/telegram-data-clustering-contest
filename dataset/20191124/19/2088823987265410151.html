      <p>After bringing up five children, David Anthony had no idea he would be raising three more youngsters in his retirement, but he wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
      <p>The 64-year-old Niagara Falls man stepped in to take care of his brother's children after his brother died unexpectedly in April, and he was awarded full custody.</p>
      <p>"You never, ever turn your back on family, no matter what," he said.</p>
      <p>He comes from a family of 11 children with a strong mother who taught them to take care of each other.</p>
      <p>"You never know when your family will need you or when you're going to need family," Anthony recalls his mother saying. "It was no hesitation taking the kids. That was the way we were raised."</p>
      <p>So now Ashlynn, 10, Zechariah, 7, and Xavion, 6, have joined their Uncle David and his girlfriend, Germaine West, and her 25-year-old special needs daughter in their three-bedroom apartment.</p>
      <p>No. 1 on their wish list: a four-bedroom apartment.</p>
      <p>"That's my biggest problem now, is to find enough room," he said. "It's hard to find a four-bedroom. I can find them, but I can't afford it."</p>
      <p>He is retired from working for an industrial cleaning firm. Doubling the size of the family has put a strain on finances, so Anthony went to Community Missions of the Niagara Frontier for a little help at Christmas.</p>
      <p>"It's so expensive now," he said, adding that he wants to stay in Niagara Falls so the children can continue in their schools.</p>
      <p>Community Missions is part of the Western New York Holiday Partnership. The Buffalo News Neediest fund is in the midst of its 38th campaign, with donated toys distributed to needy families like the Anthonys through the Holiday Partnership, which is administered by 211 WNY-Olmsted Center for Sight. Monetary donations go to the Food Bank of Western New York, which provides extra holiday food for clients at certain food pantries.</p>

      <p>Anthony was close to his brother, Jimmy, and had taken him to the hospital when he complained of numbness and sudden bouts of blindness. The following day his brother was discharged, and he took him home. The next morning, he got a call that Ashlynn could not wake up her father.</p>
      <p>"I rushed over there, I found him on the living room floor," Anthony said. Jimmy had died from a stroke or a heart attack, he said.</p>
      <p>"Right away, I knew all they got here is me," he said. "Right away, I knew that was my job."</p>
      <p>Today, "Uncle David" is their mainstay. He goes over their homework with them, and keeps track of them. The family will spend their first Christmas together this year without their father and brother.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to make it as joyful as I can for them," he said. "I try to do the best I can with what I got."</p>
      <p>And he added, "I constantly let them know that they look just like their daddy, and we all love them. I wouldn't want them to be anywhere else."</p>
      <p>Families who are eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)Â can receive toys and gifts for their children 12 and younger through the <a href="http://www.211wny.org/resources/holiday-partnership/">Western New York Holiday Partnership</a>.
