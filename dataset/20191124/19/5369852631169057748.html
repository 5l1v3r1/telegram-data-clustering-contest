      <p>IRELAND INTERNATIONAL CLARE Shine scored a brilliant last-minute goal, as Glasgow City beat Hibernian 4-3 in today’s Scottish Women’s Cup final at Tynecastle.</p>
      <p>It caps a terrific year for Glasgow, who last month won their <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/50161910">13th consecutive league title</a>.</p>
      <p>It is their ninth cup success in total and first since 2015.</p>
      <p>The match was watched in front of 3,123 supporters — a record attendance for a women’s domestic game in Scotland.</p>
      <p>Amy Gallacher gave Hibs the lead just after the half-hour mark, before Eilish McSorley equalised.</p>
      <p>Scotland international Leanne Crichton then put Glasgow in front prior to the break, before Jamie-Lee Napier drew the game level again.</p>
      <p>Hibs looked set to retain the trophy, when Glasgow skipper Leanne Ross turned Gallagher’s cross into her own net.</p>
      <p>However, 24-year-old Cork native Shine then turned the game on its head. She equalised with a header, before carrying the ball into the box and finishing superbly as the contest reached its climax.</p>
      <p>Shine, who was awarded Player of the Match, is in her second spell at Glasgow, playing there from 2015-2017, before returning earlier this year after two years with Cork City.</p>

      <p>She earned her only Ireland cap in a Euro 2017 qualifier against Spain four years ago, but was <a href="https://www.the42.ie/ireland-women-greece-euro-2021-4888225-Nov2019/">named in Vera Pauw’s squad</a> for the recent trip to Greece.</p>
