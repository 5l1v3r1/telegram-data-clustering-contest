      <h1>R. Kelly ex-girlfriend breaks silence and calls herself a 'victim'</h1>

      <p>The former girlfriend of singer Robert Kelly spoke out for the first time after a two-year social media hiatus, calling herself "one of his victims, yes victim."</p>
      <p>Joycelyn Savage, now 24-years-old, teased her comments on Instagram Saturday and later claimed in a Patreon <a href="https://www.patreon.com/Joycelynsavage/posts">post</a> that she was <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/r-kellys-girlfriend-joycelyn-savage-speaks-singer-saying-she-is-a-victim-1257639?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=referral">kidnapped</a> and brainwashed by the popular R&amp;B singer. According to her, Kelly, "would always look at me in a sexual way the first couple of times we met occasionally." As a teenager, she recalled she felt that she "didn’t have nothing to worry about at the time."</p>
      <p>Later on, however, Savage revealed that her relationship with the singer deteriorated into violence and control.</p>
      <p>"Robert started giving me commands and making sure I call him by certain names like 'Master' or 'Daddy,' which I didn’t really care for at the time," she shared. "If I wasn’t getting paid or pursuing my dream, I would’ve went home, but all of that didn’t stop just yet. But it started getting worse by day by day. He would raise his voice at me if I didn’t call him by those two names. If Robert called me, I would have to reply with 'Yes, daddy' or 'Please daddy.' He was so controlling."</p>

      <p>In March, Savage's parents <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/father-of-brainwashed-r-kelly-girlfriend-lashes-out-where-is-my-daughter">attempted to contact her through media</a> to no avail. In her Patreon piece, she explained that Kelly's assistants never spoke to her but were always watching her.</p>
      <p>"They never spoken to me or anything they just watched me, which was weird to me at the time," she said. "I can say I didn’t have any type of privacy at all now that I think of it. If I showered, one of his assistants would have to be by the door while I shower. At the moment, I kept thinking to myself, why is all of this, does he think I will run away?"</p>
      <p>Kelly, 52, was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/r-kelly-arrested-on-federal-child-porn-racketeering-obstruction-charges">arrested in July on charges of child pornography</a>, racketeering, and obstruction of justice among the 13-count indictment. He has been jailed in Chicago since that time. Kelly was also arrested in February for similar charges involving sex with minors, abuse, and trafficking. Rumors of inappropriate behavior with underage girls have swirled around Kelly throughout his career, but the most recent charges resulted in detainment without the option of bail.</p>
