      <p>Romania's centrist President Klaus Iohannis easily won a presidential runoff vote on Sunday as expected, crushing his socialist challenger on a pledge to restart a judicial reform slowed down by successive Social Democrat (PSD) governments.<br/><br/>An exit poll conducted by IRES pollster showed Iohannis garnered 66.5% of votes followed by Social Democrats (PSD) leader and former Prime Minister Viorica Dancila with 33.5%. Another pollster, CURS-Avangarde showed Iohannis winning with 64%.<br/><br/>In the first round of voting on November 10, Iohannis won 38 percent of the vote, ahead of 13 other candidates. Dancila came second with 22 percent.<br/><br/>Analysts say voters who backed lower-placed candidates can be expected to largely swing behind Iohannis, amid deep resentment toward the PSD over controversial judicial reforms.<br/><br/><b>'Normal Romania'</b><br/><br/>"I voted for a Romania that is modern, European and normal," Iohannis told reporters after casting his ballot on Sunday. A total of 18.2 million Romanians are eligible to vote with turnout at close to 50 percent two hours before polls closed.<br/><br/>A record 650,000 voters are abroad – part of a four-million strong diaspora who have emigrated in search for better paying jobs – and tending to favour liberal candidates.<br/><br/>The PSD government had engaged in a long battle with the European Union, and Iohannis who backed Brussels, over allegations it was trying to push through measures to neuter the judiciary and benefit PSD politicians.<br/><br/>The left-wing party, which is seen as the successor of the ruling elite before the overthrow of communism in 1989 and has dominated politics since, has been accused of widespread corruption.<br/><br/>And while nationalism has been less present in Romanian politics than elsewhere in the region – such as in Hungary or Poland – the PSD tried to frame its clashes with EU institutions as evidence that it was standing up for Romania.<br/><br/>"I voted for a presidential mandate where we see more involvement and respect for the Romanian people and for our national interests," Dancila told reporters after voting.<br/><br/><b>Judicial controversy</b><br/><br/>After the PSD-led administration's fall, Iohannis tasked ally Ludovic Orban with forming a new government to be in place until legislative elections due late next year.<br/><br/>Iohannis made the rule of law a central plank of his campaign for a second five-year term, promising to help build functioning institutions without corruption.<br/><br/>Former Foreign Minister Cristian Diaconescu said Iohannis – who hails from the German minority and whose 2014 victory over a PSD candidate was a surprise – represents the "only European and Euro-Atlantic option".<br/><br/>Under the constitution, Romania's president is responsible for foreign affairs as well as approving the appointment of judges and top prosecutors.<br/><br/>Hundreds of thousands of Romanians have protested against the judicial reforms proposed by the PSD, seen as giving politicians a way to avoid corruption sentences.<br/><br/>"I'm very upset. They made rules just to help themselves," said Marin Cumatrenco, a 20-year-old film student who voted early Sunday in Bucharest, adding the most important for him was to "continue the European course".<br/><br/>Sociologist Alin Teodorescu has estimated that introducing the reforms has cost the PSD more than a million votes.<br/><br/><b>'Dictator' vs. 'toxic'</b><br/><br/>The PSD, which has become increasingly reliant on an ageing, rural electorate, has accused Iohannis of being a "dictator".<br/><br/>Criticized for refusing any face-to-face debate during the campaign, Iohannis, in turn, called his rival the "incarnation of a toxic regime".<br/><br/>Dancila, 55, an engineer by training, has highlighted the strong economic growth recorded during the PSD's time in office, including increases in pensions and salaries in the public sector.<br/><br/>But this largesse has sparked concerns by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has warned about the country's rising fiscal deficit.<br/><br/>In May, the PSD's former chief and strongman, Liviu Dragnea was jailed on corruption charges, and the party also saw its support plunge during European elections.</p>
