      <h1>Sheffield United 3-3 Manchester United: Youthful exuberance and tactical naivety cancel each other out for Solskjaer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:43:38+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:43</time> by <a rel="author">Felix Keith</a></address>
      <p>At the end of a Premier League weekend which was defined by damaging results for under-pressure managers, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer went through the wringer in an unpredictable, see-sawing classic at Bramall Lane today.</p>
      <p>The Manchester United manager veered from joining the pending P45 crew of Marco Silva, Unai Emery and Manuel Pellegrini at 2-0 down, to redemptive managerial masterclass territory at 3-2 up, before ending up back where he started as a principled but flawed youth promoter when the full-time whistle blew at 3-3. </p>

      </p>
      <p>In many ways the game told the story of United under Solskjaer: naive and disorganised defensively, yet with glimpses of exciting, sprightly potential in attack. </p>
      <p>Their opponents largely resembled the side we have come to expect under Chris Wilder: organised, hard working and inventive. To see them allow the game to swing back in the away side’s favour by conceding three goals – more than in any other game this season – in a hectic seven-minute period was uncharacteristic. </p>
      <h3>Calamitous Jones</h3>
      <p>As impressive as Solskjaer’s team were for a brief but profitable spell in the second half, they were every bit as bad in the first half. </p>
      <p>Sheffield United started on the front foot and pummelled the visitors into submission, with possession coughed up frequently to allow the continuation of pressure.</p>

      <p>Solskjaer’s decision to switch formation and play a five-man defence backfired spectacularly as the addition of Phil Jones was quickly regretted. Jones was substituted at half-time for the third time in his last five matches, but the damage had already been done when the centre-back was brushed off the ball by Lys Mousset in the build-up to John Fleck’s opener.</p>
      <p>As bad as Jones was – and he was near the upper limits of the Jones calamity sliding scale – the away side’s midfield was almost worse. Andreas Pereira and Fred didn’t appear to be a workable duo on paper and sure enough they were dreadful in reality, giving away the ball in dangerous areas and drifting out of position with regularity. Pereira misplaced a whopping 24 passes in total, while Fred was nowhere to be seen when Mousset charged into wide open space and rifled in to make it 2-0.</p>
      <h3>Youthful revival</h3>
      <p>Solskjaer will have been as delighted as onlookers were surprised by United’s revival, which had its roots in youth and a tactical rejig. Jones was jettisoned for Jesse Lingard at the break and the away side made hay in quick time. Brandon Williams’ sweetly-struck half-volley gave hope before substitute Mason Greenwood poked in Marcus Rashford’s curling cross to equalise. </p>
      <p>Rashford finished off a flowing move involving Anthony Martial and Daniel James to make it 3-2 and ensure that three goals had been scored in seven minutes by players aged 19, 18 and 22. </p>

      <p>But in such an open, end-to-end game it was nowhere near safe. Wilder’s decisions had a similar impact when Callum Robinson crossed for fellow substitute Oli McBurnie to volley in past David de Gea’s grasp.</p>
      <p> “Sometimes football is beyond tactics,” Solskjaer offered post-match. But sometimes implementing them properly can prevent a helter-skelter 3-3 draw. </p>
      <p>With Manchester United in ninth place, on four wins from 13 Premier League games, the Norwegian needs to settle on the right ones quickly.</p>
