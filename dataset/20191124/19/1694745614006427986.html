      <p><b><a href="http://www.popsugar.com/Lizzie-McGuire">Lizzie McGuire</a></b> is returning to our TV screens, and we couldn't be more pumped. In August, it was announced that Disney+ would be rebooting the beloved Disney Channel franchise for <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/What-Lizzie-McGuire-Reboot-About-46569612">a brand-new series that follows a 30-year-old Lizzie navigating life in NYC</a>. Though an official release date hasn't been announced yet, it's likely we won't have to wait too long to be reunited with our teenage hero now that <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/lizzie-mcguire-tv-sequel-photos-46805878">filming is officially underway</a>.</p>
      <p>Production for Disney+'s <b><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/High-School-Musical:-The-Musical:-The-Series">High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</a></b> this year started on Feb. 15, and the first season was eventually released on Nov. 12. If <b>Lizzie McGuire</b> follows a similar filming schedule, that could put the release date sometime around July 2020.</p>
      <p>Over the past few weeks, we've been getting even more exciting tidbits about the upcoming series. In addition to getting glimpses of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/lizzie-mcguire-outfits-in-disney-reboot-pictures-46878334">Lizzie's new style during filming</a>, there have been quite <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/lizzie-mcguire-reboot-cast-46805951">a few big casting announcements</a>. The entire McGuire family — Jake Thomas, Hallie Todd, and Robert Carradine — are reprising their roles for the reboot, along with <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/will-gordo-be-in-lizzie-mcguire-reboot-46924368">Adam Lamberg as Lizzie's childhood best friend, Gordo</a>. Needless to say, we're counting down the days until we're reunited with Lizzie and the gang!</p>
