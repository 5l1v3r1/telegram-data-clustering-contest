      <p>No. 2 Ohio State gained some ground on No. 1 LSU in The Associated Press college football poll and Oregon dropped out of the top 10 after being upset by Arizona State.</p>
      <p>The Tigers remained No. 1 for the fifth straight week in the AP Top 25 presented by Regions Bank, receiving 50 first-places votes. The Buckeyes got nine first-place votes, up from five last week. No. 3 Clemson received three first-place votes. No. 4 Georgia and No. 5 Alabama also held their spots.</p>
      <p>Ohio State is coming off a 28-17 victory over Penn State that dropped the Nittany Lions two spots to No. 11.</p>
      <p>Oregon dropped eight spots to No. 14 after losing 31-28 at Arizona State. That allowed Utah to move up a spot to No. 6 and Oklahoma to No. 7. Florida, Minnesota and Michigan round out the top 10.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>POLL POINTS</p>
      <p>Alabama has now been ranked for 209 consecutive weeks, starting with the 2008 preseason poll, tying Florida (Sept. 9, 1990-Oct. 5, 2002) for the third-longest streak in poll history. Nebraska has the longest streak at 348 weeks (21 years, Oct. 12, 1981-Sept. 22, 2002) and Florida State is second with 211 weeks (12 years, Sept. 24, 1989-Nov. 11, 2001).</p>
      <p>The Tide should tie Bobby Bowden's Seminoles this season and surpass them in next year's preseason poll. There are typically 16 polls in a season, counting preseason and final. At that rate, Alabama would pass the record Nebraska set under coach Tom Osborne in Week 5 of the 2029 season.</p>
      <p>FYI, Nick Saban would be about a month shy of his 78th birthday.</p>
      <p>IN</p>
      <p>- No. 24 Navy jumped into the rankings, knocking out American Athletic Conference rival SMU.</p>
      <p>- No. 25 Southern California finished its regular season by beating rival UCLA and jumping back into the rankings. The Trojans have had two previous one-week stays in the poll this season.</p>
      <p>OUT</p>
      <p>- Texas A&amp;M fell out after a brief return to the AP Top 25. The Aggies lost for the fourth time, this time to Georgia. All of A&amp;M's losses have come against teams ranked in the current top 16. It gets no easier for the Aggies next week. They will face No. 1 LSU and become the first team in the history of the AP poll, which dates to 1936, to face a No. 1 three times in one season. Playing the No. 1 team twice in one season has happened 30 times previously, and that's including seven teams that played one of those games in the postseason.</p>
      <p>Texas A&amp;M lost to No. 1 Clemson 24-10 in September and to No. 1 Alabama 47-28 in October.</p>
      <p>CONFERNCE CALL</p>
      <p>Big Ten - 6 (Nos. 2, 9, 10, 12, 13, 19).</p>
      <p>SEC - 5 (Nos. 1, 4, 5, 8, 16).</p>
      <p>American - 3 (Nos. 17, 18, 24).</p>
      <p>Big 12 - 3 (Nos. 7, 11, 21).</p>
      <p>Pac 12 - 3 (Nos. 6, 14, 25).</p>
      <p>ACC - 2 (Nos. 3, 23).</p>
      <p>Mountain West - 1 (No. 20).</p>
      <p>Sun Belt - 1 (No. 22).</p>
      <p>Independent - 1 (No. 15).</p>
      <p>RANKED vs. RANKED</p>
      <p>No. 2 Ohio State at No. 10 Michigan. Is THIS the year Jim Harbaugh finally breaks through against the Buckeyes?</p>
      <p>No. 5 Alabama at No. 16 Auburn. All eyes on Alabama backup quarterback Mac Jones in the Iron Bowl.</p>
      <p>No. 7 Oklahoma at No. 21 Oklahoma State. Bedlam is for bragging rights and the Sooners' playoff hopes.</p>
      <p>No. 13 Wisconsin at No. 9 Minnesota. The winner goes to the Big Ten championship game as West Division champion.</p>
      <p>No. 18 Cincinnati at No. 17 Memphis. The Tigers need a victory to clinch the AAC West - and a rematch at home with the Bearcats the next week.</p>
