      <p>Michael Bloomberg — portrayed by former cast member Fred Armisen — crashed the Democratic presidential debate while sipping on a Big Gulp during a sketch on “Saturday Night Live.”</p>
      <p>As each of the Democratic candidates were making their case during the presidential campaign parody, Bloomberg suddenly appeared on stage following Will Ferrell as billionaire Tom Steyer.</p>
      <p>“Did somebody say billionaire?” Armisen’s Bloomberg asked.</p>
      <p>MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, played by Melissa Villasenor, asked how he got into the debate.</p>
      <p>“I tipped the doorman $30 million,” Bloomberg said.</p>
      <p>Maddow then asked if that meant he was officially entering the race.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know. Maybe. Maybe not. I’d be hard to beat,” said Armisen, who returned to the role he played when Bloomberg was mayor.</p>
      <p>“I’d love to see those Trump supporters come up with a conspiracy theory about a Jewish billionaire with his own media company. Good luck making that stick!”</p>
      <p>He made another cameo appearance later in the skit – this time holding two Big Gulps.</p>
      <p>“Is there time for me to come in late and ruin everything,” he said about 12 hours before the former mayor <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/michael-bloomberg-officially-declares-white-house-bid/">officially entered the 2020 presidential race</a>.</p>
      <p>Told the candidates must begin making their closing statements, Bloomberg said he had to “throw in some Spanish.”</p>
      <p>“Miguel Bloomberg is <i>en fuego</i>,” he said.</p>
