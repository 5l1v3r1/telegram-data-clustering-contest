        <b>Manchester United were held by Sheffield United at Bramall Lane, piling more pressure on an under-fire Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b>
      </p>
      <p>Manchester United were minutes away from coming back from two goals behind to beat Sheffield United at Bramall Lane.</p>
      <p>But in the 90th minute, Oli McBurnie popped up to level proceedings, ending a dramatic afternoon of football.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils were two goals down after John Fleck and Lys Mousset found the net, as they struggled to lay a glove on the newly-promoted side.</p>
      <p>But while Solskjaer's men were lacklustre for the first 70 minutes, they came alive in the closing stages, scoring three in quick succession to turn the tide completely.</p>
      <p>But in the dying seconds, Sheffield United scored from close range to shatter the hearts of the travelling fans.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer's side deserve credit for their initial comeback - but who impressed and who flopped in the epic clash?</p>
      <p>
        <b>David de Gea - 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kept out David McGoldrick from close-range with a fine save. Potentially could have done better with the second goal</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aaron Wan-Bissaka - 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Struggled going forward, taking far too long with his decision making</p>
      <p>
        <b>Phil Jones - 2</b>
      </p>
      <p>A surprise inclusion. At fault for the first goal. Hooked at half-time</p>
      <p>
        <b>Victor Lindelof - 4</b>
      </p>
      <p>Questions if he is up to scratch</p>
      <p>
        <b>Harry Maguire - 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>The defender undoubtedly makes the side stronger but a tricky afternoon</p>

      <p>
        <b>Brandon Williams - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lovely half-volley from the youngster to start the comeback</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fred - 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Suffered the wrath of Manchester United fans on Twitter after a poor showing</p>
      <p>
        <b>Andreas Pereira - 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Couldn't replicate his recent upturn in form. Gave the ball away too often</p>
      <p>
        <b>Anthony Martial - 4</b>
      </p>
      <p>Absent for long periods in the tie and was replaced by Mason Greenwood</p>

      <p>
        <b>Marcus Rashford - 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gary Neville was not impressed on commentary but the striker chipped in with a goal and assist</p>
      <p>
        <b>Daniel James - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Put in a shift and was a big part of the late rally</p>
      <p>
        <b>Subs:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Jesse Lingard - 4</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brought on at half-time for Phil Jones but couldn't change the game</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mason Greenwood - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Off the bench to poke one home</p>
      <p>
        <b>Axel Tuanzebe - N/A</b>
