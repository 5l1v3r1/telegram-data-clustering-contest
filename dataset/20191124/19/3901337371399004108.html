      <p>Maritzburg United reached the Telkom Knockout final by beating Kaizer Chiefs, but Eric Tinkler was disappointed with one aspect of his side's game.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/local/categories/kaizer-chiefs/telkom-knockout-semi-final-report-kaizer-chiefs-v-maritzburg-united-24-november-2019/668078">Read: Chiefs' Trophy Drought Continues After Shock TKO Exit</a></b><br/>Â <br/>A brace from Judas Moseamedi guided the Team of Choice to a 2-1 victory over the Soweto giants at Mbombela Stadium on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Despite claiming the famous win, Tinkler was not pleased with the amount of chances his side squandered on the day.</p>
      <p>"I think it would have been a gross injustice if we didn't win this I must be brutally honest. I thought in the first half we performed extremely well, defensively well structured, well organised, on the transitions we were exceptional," Tinkler told SuperSport after the match.</p>
      <p>"We should have at least come up at half-time 3-0 up, you know with the easy chances that we had. I explained to the players at half-time that I can't be happy with that. We came in at 1-0 and we left the door open for them. We needed to close that door in the first-half.</p>
      <p>"Then we started the second half well, we had at least another two, three great opportunities.I warned them at half-time, they [Kaizer Chiefs] came back with a free-kick where their strength is, equalise. But overall we dominated, we looked like a team that was playing at home but not the team playing away against a massive club like Kaizer Chiefs.</p>
      <p>"Today we could have really slaughtered them! I thought at least five or six easy chances, it's not like I'm inventing these chances, clear cut chances. That's my disappointment. But very happy at the end of it all to get a 2-1 win, we're going to the final," he continued.</p>
      <p>"[Defensively] we dealt with them, [Samir] Nurkovic pulling out wide, Pogiso [Sanoka] needed to deal with that, sometimes Pogiso was caught with [Lebogang] Manyama as well, there we needed Miguel [Timm] to come and support. I thought we dealt with that long ball fairly decently, it was really on the free-kick that we got caught."</p>
