      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:24:09+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:24</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was quick to point out the improvements he has overseen as <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss - despite his side battling to a fortunate draw at Sheffield United on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Substitute Oli McBurnie secured the Blades a deserved share of the spoils as a thrilling, helter-skelter clash with the Red Devils ended in a 3-3 draw.</p>
      <p>United were shell-shocked when they fell two goals down but they then turned the game on its head as three quickfire goals from their academy graduates put them 3-2 up.</p>
      <p>Brandon Williams scored his first goal for the club in the 72nd minute before substitute Mason Greenwood connected with a superb Marcus Rashford cross five minutes later to level things up.</p>

      <p>And, moments after McBurnie cancelled out Marcus Rashford's strike in stoppage time, Solskjaer, rather than highlight his side's struggles, decided to praise the character of his team.</p>
      <p>He said: "Sometimes football is beyond tactics. The energy compared to ours in the first half and then we get that goal and we start to belief.</p>
      <p>"The difference in the team this year compared to last is huge. They never give in. Last year we would have gone four or five down instead of coming back. We would not have been able to come back.</p>

      <p>"When you are 2-0 down you have to go for it, play with less fear and just go for it. The average ages of the goals is less than 20, it’s something we are proud of.</p>
      <p>"It’s a great experience for our young players because it’s not easy to comeback at a place like this."</p>
      <p>The visitors were outfought for long periods at a bouncing Bramall Lane, but, with the shadow of the newly out-of-work Mauricio Pochettino looming large over Solskjaer, his side produced a spirited comeback.</p>

      <p>Asked how he felt about their performance, Solskjaer added: "It’s mixed emotions. We cannot be happy, we have not performed for the majority of the game but we turned it around and we showed what we could be capable of.</p>
      <p>"We have to do it now for a whole game. We know we can, we just have to show it.</p>
      <p>"Sheffield United looked like they wanted it more than us and believed in their game plan more than we did. We did not have a shot on target first half which is not acceptable."</p>
