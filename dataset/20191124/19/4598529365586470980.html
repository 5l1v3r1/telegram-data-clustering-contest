      <p>Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) on Sunday still pushed President Donald Trump’s conspiracy theory that Ukraine was behind the DNC email hacks even after former NSC senior director Fiona Hill firmly debunked the claim.</p>
      <p>“Senator Kennedy, who do you believe was responsible for hacking the DNC and Clinton campaign computers, their emails?” Fox News host Chris Wallace asked. “Was it Russia or Ukraine?”</p>
      <p>Kennedy responded with “I don’t know, nor do you, nor do any of us. Ms. Hill-” before Wallace cut in.</p>
      <p>“Let me just interrupt to say the entire intelligence community says it was Russia,” the Fox News host said.</p>
      <p>“Right, but it could also be Ukraine,” Kennedy replied.</p>
      <p>“I’m not saying that I know one way or the other,” he continued. “I’m saying that Ms. Hill is entitled to her opinion, but no rebuttal evidence was allowed to be offered.”</p>
      <p>During her public testimony in the impeachment investigation last week, Hill <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/fiona-hill-opening-statement-impeachment-inquiry">told</a> the House Intelligence Committee that the conspiracy theory was a “fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.”</p>
      <p>“In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests,” she said.</p>
