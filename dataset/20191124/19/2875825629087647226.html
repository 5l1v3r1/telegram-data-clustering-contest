      <h1>Tearful Saffron Barker exits Strictly after most controversial dance-off in history</h1>
      <h2>Strictly Come Dancing viewers were in disbelief as Karim Zeroual 'scandalously' landed in the bottom two with Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard despite finishing top of the leaderboard</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:54:32+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:54</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Saffron Barker was left in tears after becoming the ninth celebrity to leave <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> 2019.</p>
      <p>The YouTube sensation and her professional partner AJ Pritchard were knocked out of the competition after a dreaded dance-off marred in controversy.</p>
      <p>Despite finishing joint top of Saturday night's leaderboard, Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden found themselves in the bottom two when the scores were combined with the results of the public vote.</p>
      <p>The judges unanimously decided to save Karim and Amy - but the 'scandalous' dance-off has led for calls for a complete overhaul of the result system.</p>
      <p>Emotional Saffron struggled to hold back the tears even before the dance-off - then broke down after being kicked out as she praised AJ for taking her out of her shell.</p>

      <p>When asked by host Tess Daly about her time on the show, Saffron said: "I’ve had the absolute time of my life and it’s all down to him. It’s been amazing.</p>
      <p>"I’d like to thank AJ so much, when I look at what I was like on week one I was so embarrassed and shy. He’s really taken me out of my shell. Thank you so much for everything."</p>
      <p>Giving some words about his celeb partner, AJ added: " Every single week you’ve approached it with a positive mental attitude and you’ve inspired so many… on your own social media too.</p>
      <p>"As a non-dancer starting from day one I’m not going to lie I was a bit scared… but performing those fantastic dances has been amazing. I’ll never ever ever forget that dance. Thank you. The best partner. Thank you."</p>

      <p>Saffron and AJ faced an uphill battle after finding out they were up against the pair who finished top of the leaderboard.</p>
      <p>The pair failed to convince the judges to save them after performing their Samba to Walking On Sunshine by Take Me To Rio Collective.</p>
      <p>Giving his decision, Craig Revel Horwood said: "Tonight was easy for me the best dance tonight was Amy and Karim."</p>

      <p>Motsi Mabuse, who also chose to save Karim, said: "One couple left me no choice, it was a perfect performance and I’m going to save Karim and Amy."</p>
      <p>In agreement, Bruno Tonioli said: “I want to keep the couple that has proven to be the strongest both technically and artistically.”</p>
      <p>Head judge Shirley Ballas said she would also have chosen to save Karim and Amy, who impressed with their Contemporary Couples Choice to Drops Of Jupiter by With Confidence.</p>

      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , one shocked viewer said: "Karim in the dance off?! You should never ask the audience ever again"</p>
      <p>Another added: "How Karim is in the bottom 2 is beyond my comprehension. Did voters think he was safe and support someone else instead?"</p>
      <p>A third agreed: "Having Karim &amp; Amy in the dance-off is beyond logical explanation. Their dance was stunning &amp; were they to leave it would really damage the rest of this year’s competition."</p>
      <p>A fourth said: "I really don’t trust the public to vote in this up coming <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/general-election">general election</a> if they are prepared to put Karim and Amy in the #Strictly dance off"</p>

      <p>Poor AJ fell victim to the 'samba curse' for the third series in a row.</p>
      <p>The professional dancer had been hoping to avoid leaving the competition on the dreaded dance.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday night's It Takes Two, he told host Rylan Clark Neal: "Unfortunately the past two years I've gone out on a samba.</p>
      <p>"This is not going to happen. This is going to be the year. Samba curse gone."</p>
      <p>Fearful Saffron added: "It's like really sad. I'm praying. Every year it's happened to him. We can't let it happen again."</p>
