      <h1>'Baby Yoda' GIFs are being pulled down for copyright reasons, but there are too many for the claims to be effective</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:35:58+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/kat-tenbarge" target="_blank">Kat Tenbarge</a></address>
      <ul>
        <li>After Vulture put together a bunch of "Baby Yoda" GIFs featuring the breakout star of "The Mandalorian," the GIFs <a href="https://twitter.com/kvanaren/status/1197548426726137856">were removed</a> from GIF-sharing platform Giphy for "copyright reasons."</li>
        <li>Vulture responded by doing the article with <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/the-mandalorian-baby-yoda-images.html">original artwork</a> of Baby Yoda instead, but the removal raised questions over what Disney's stance on GIF usage of its characters is, and whether making them constitutes copyright infringement.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, other Baby Yoda GIFs are still popping up <a href="https://giphy.com/search/baby-yoda">on Giphy</a>, and they're clearly in use around the web, if the <a href="http://insider.com/best-baby-yoda-tweets-memes-the-mandalorian-2019-11">countless memes</a> and reactions are any indication.</li>
        <li>GIFs usage and copyright have yet to be litigated in the US. </li>

      <p>Be careful using "Baby Yoda" GIFs, because there appears to be a crackdown on at least some of the people making them. </p>
      <p>Vulture reviewer Kathryn VanArendonk <a href="https://twitter.com/kvanaren/status/1197548426726137856">tweeted that</a>, in the process of writing an article about the storyline of the internet's breakout obsession from Disney's "The Mandalorian," the publication put together several GIFs of the little creature lovingly termed Baby Yoda. </p>
      <p>"The Mandalorian" is part of the Disney Plus streaming service, and the show set in the Star Wars universe is the most popular <a href="https://www.insider.com/disney-plus-mandalorian-one-of-biggest-streaming-shows-of-year-2019-11">streaming hit</a> of 2019. Vulture used the GIF-making and -sharing website Giphy to create its own, but received an email saying that the content had been removed "for copyright reasons," VanArendonk said.</p>
      <p>VanArendonk told Insider that Vulture received a "pretty standard DMCA takedown notice" in an email from Giphy, referring to the Digital Millenium Copyright Act that <a href="https://www.copyrighted.com/blog/dmca-guide">is intended to</a> regulate copyright infringement issues online. It didn't state who made the complaint.</p>

      <p>Vulture responded by making its <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/the-mandalorian-baby-yoda-images.html">own artwork</a> of Baby Yoda instead, but the GIF removal raised questions about why Baby Yoda GIFs would have anything to do with copyright infringement. Technically, there isn't US legal precedent stating whether GIFs made from copyrighted material fall under copyright infringement law.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/propointgraphics/2016/04/30/animated-gifs-and-fair-use-what-is-and-isnt-legal-according-to-copyright-law/#2552a167371b">Forbes article</a> on the topic argued that a Star Wars GIF could be interpreted as falling under Fair Use because it is "transformative" and doesn't undermine the market for the original material. </p>
      <p>"No one, for instance, is going to watch a Star Wars GIF instead of the original movie," said Jeff John Roberts, a former lawyer who writes about technology, publishing, and privacy. But the legality of GIFs can't truly be determined until the matter comes before a court.</p>
      <p>Regardless, searching "baby yoda" on Giphy returns several GIF results – and, of course, Baby Yoda GIFs are still prominent elsewhere on social media and the internet. </p>
      <p>Neither Giphy nor Disney immediately returned Insider's request for comment.</p>
