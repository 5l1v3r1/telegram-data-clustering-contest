      <p>The shock Strictly Come Dancing results just keep on coming and fans of the show can't get their heads around this week's bottom two.</p>
      <p>This year is definitely the year of the surprise results on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly</a> , with viewers still scratching their hands over Dev Griffin's premature exit from the BBC programme and expressing similar shock at frontrunner Michelle Visage's departure from the ballroom last week.</p>
      <p>The latest dancefloor casualty is social media star <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/who-is-saffron-barker-strictly-17271636">Saffron Barker,</a> who has been voted off the show alongside her professional partner AJ Pritchard.</p>
      <p>But it is the fact that they were in the dance-off with Karim &amp; Amy that has angered Strictly fans the most, with many furious about it as soon as the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/strictly-come-dancing-spoiler-result-17307779">Strictly spoiler leaked</a> late on on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Karim is one of the strongest contenders and highest scorers of the series so far, with the CBBC presenter consistently near the top of the leaderboard.</p>
      <p>One fan tweeted "Karim in the dance off! I am shook!!!!," and, echoing those sentiments, another reacted "Can’t believe Karim in the dance off. Why???" with a third fan puzzled at the outcome of the public vote, posting "Kinda shocked about the results tbf - was thinking Karim would never be in the bottom."</p>
      <p>Other viewers think voters are wrongly backing the 'underdogs' this year, with one ranting "People in this country need to get over their obsession with the “underdog”. It’s a sickness. If both Kelvin and Karim don’t make the final and one of them win, strictly will officially be a joke," and another writing "KARIM of all people was in the dance off! This is why voting matters and the favourites are most definitely not safe."</p>
      <p>On Saturday's live show, Karim was lambasted by judge Craig Revel-Horwood for lacking emotion not just in his dance this week, but throughout the whole of the competition, something else viewers have taken exception to.</p>
