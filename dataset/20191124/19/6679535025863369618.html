      <h2>Telugu film actor dives into sports promotion; adds celeb quotient to Hyderabad franchise in TPL</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:10:14+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/V-V-Subrahmanyam-1479/" target="_blank">V.V. Subrahmanyam</a></address>
      <p>Film star Rakul Preet Singh has taken her “special connect” with the city to a new domain — sports promotion. The tinsel town celebrity has bought a stake in the Finecab Hyderabad Strikers franchise which features in the Tennis Premier League next month.</p>
      <p>Rakul, who played golf at the national level before venturing into film industry and loves tennis with Leander Paes and Sania Mirza being her favourites, says that she has a special bond with the city which made her big. “We travelled across India because my father was an ex-serviceman. But, Hyderabad is the city where I stayed the longest and this is where my heart belongs. It is a very, very special place for me. Although I had other options to look for in the TPL, I preferred to be a co-owner of Strikers,” she said after unveiling the team jersey here on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“I am excited to be part of TPL which I believe is a huge platform for budding talent to take their game to the next level. It gives a chance to the best under-14 and under-18 talent too a huge opportunity to showcase their skills,” she said, adding that the stake could be the first big step to venture into sports promotion.</p>
      <p>TPL will be held in Mumbai from December 12. The Strikers have former national champion S. Narendranath as mentor besides 15-year-old Gaurav Bhutada as the youngest CEO of any sports franchise in India.</p>
