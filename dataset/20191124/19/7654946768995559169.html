      <p>Stay classy, Cleveland.</p>
      <p>Videos tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/clevelanddotcom/status/1198648029697458177">Cleveland.com</a> and others show Browns fans swinging a Steelers helmet at a piñata with Mason Rudolph’s image and jersey painted on it.</p>
      <p>In one clip, a blindfolded fan wearing an Odell Beckham jersey is trying to hit the piñata while another fan in a Myles Garrett jersey moves the piñata around. The crowd cheers, throws yellow penalty flags and attempts to guide her verbally as she misses repeatedly.</p>
      <p>The raucous scene appears to have taken place during a Cleveland tailgate Sunday before the Browns hosted the Dolphins.</p>
      <p>The distasteful showing comes after the Nov. 14 Browns-Steelers brawl during which Garrett removed Rudolph’s helmet and hit him with it. <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/23/nfl-punishes-mason-rudolph-for-myles-garrett-fight/">Thirty-three players were punished</a> by the league, including Garrett, who was suspended indefinitely for his role in the melee. <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/23/nfl-punishes-mason-rudolph-for-myles-garrett-fight/">The suspension was upheld</a> by the NFL on Thursday after the 23-year old defensive end appealed the ruling.</p>
