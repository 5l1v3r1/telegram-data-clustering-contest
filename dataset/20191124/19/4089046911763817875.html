      <p><b>EL PASO, Texas (WVLT) --</b> U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers made an unusual seizure Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>Border agents seized 14 rolls of Mexican bologna that is prohibited from coming into the U.S.</p>
      <p>Mexican bologna is prohibited because it is made from pork and has the potential to introduce foreign animal diseases to the U.S. pork industry.</p>
      <p>When the driver was asked what he was bringing from Mexico he said he had frozen rolls of turkey ham. After a second inspection, border officers found 154 pounds of Mexican bologna behind the rear seat.</p>
      <p>“It is important that travelers understand they should declare all items they are transporting from abroad to avoid fines and penalties. A properly declared prohibited item can be abandoned at the port without consequence,” CBP El Paso Port Director Beverly Good said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Officials said they seized and destroyed the bologna. The driver was later released.</p>
