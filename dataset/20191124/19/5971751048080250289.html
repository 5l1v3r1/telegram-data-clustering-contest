      <p>Nokia made a <a href="https://nokiamob.net/2019/11/06/nokia-coming-back-to-the-tv-industry-with-flipkart/">deal with Flipkart</a> to stick its name on another consumer product. Indian market should soon be seeing a 55 inch Nokia Smart TV that will have a 4K LED panel joined with the JBL sound system. The proprietary OS will be Android 9 and will be able to access the Google Play Store. Now the first photos of the TV have leaked thx to the <a href="https://www.digit.in/news/tvs/exclusive-this-is-what-the-nokia-tv-launching-as-flipkart-unique-looks-like-51149.html">digit.in</a>.</p>

      <p>The photos did reveal that the screen bezels are going to be minimal and that the JBL powered speakers will be placed beneath the LED panel. Flipkart confirmed to the digit that Nokia Smart TV will also feature Clear Vocal Tones and Minimal Harmonic Distortion. Dolby Audio and DTS TruSurround Sound are expected too. When you think about this, having JBL speakers below the LED panel frees you from buying a proper TV soundbar that you should mount on the wall or keep it somewhere below the TV.</p>
      <p>Some previous <a href="https://nokiamob.net/2019/11/12/nokia-smarttv-to-run-android-9-expected-in-early-december/">rumors</a> stated that the announcement of the TV is expected in early December. Now Iâ€™m trying to find if Flipkart is delivering in Europe :).</p>
      <p>Kudos to NokiaMob lover for the tip ðŸ˜‰</p>
