      <h1>Many Man United fans canâ€™t help but moan about Liverpool after VAR decision goes against them</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:53:40+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United fans arenâ€™t happy with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ed Woodward, VAR, the Premier League, Liverpool, UEFA, the Champions League and pretty much everything right now.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils went down 2-0 against newly promoted Sheffield United, but managed to claw it back to 2-2, before taking a late lead.</p>
      <p>Untilâ€¦the Blades scored with their last breath, but there was a bit of controversy â€“ of course, VAR was consulted because it looked like the ball may have struck Oli McBurnieâ€™s arm.</p>
      <p>But it was concluded that the goal should stand, and it can only really be seen as points dropped by the Mancs. And this is where the story begins to get interesting â€“ sure, youâ€™ve probably seen Liverpool being called <i>LiVARpool </i>at some point by now, even though weâ€™ve also been hard done by!</p>
      <p>Well, United fans seem to have taken issue with VAR by the way of bring up the Reds and saying that the decision would have gone the other way for us.</p>
      <p>Funny that, because I can clearly recall Bobby Firminoâ€™s armpit being offside a few weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Honestly, itâ€™s probably just a knee jerk reaction from some fans, but itâ€™s hilarious looking in from the outside.</p>
