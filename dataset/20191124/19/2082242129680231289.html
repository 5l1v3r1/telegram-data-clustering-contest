      <p>Although it has not been officially announced yet, Darren Dreger reports that <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/157853/alexander-kerfoot">Alexander Kerfoot</a> will have a hearing (assumed to be a phone hearing) for his hit on <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/295111/erik-johnson">Erik Johnson</a> on November 23, 2019 that was assessed at the time as a two-minute minor.</p>

      <p>The hit came as the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/toronto-maple-leafs">Maple Leafs</a> were in Denver, marking <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/295117/alexander-kerfoot">Kerfoot</a>’s first visit to his old team. The <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/colorado-avalanche">Avalanche</a> players, most notably Johnson, were not happy that the penalty was only a minor. Watching the hit, it doesn’t look like an intent to injure play, more like a careless, risky play, that was saved from being truly terrible by Johnson knowing how to fall.</p>

      <p>The maximum suspension under a <a href="https://www.nhl.com/news/player-safety-questions/c-738846">phone hearing</a> is five games, and there is an option to levy a fine or to take no action. Player Safety has full discretion.</p>
      <p>So far this season, they have issued five suspensions for on-ice behaviour, all for two or three games, for infractions that range from spitting to physical abuse of officials. The only boarding suspension went to <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/294598/adam-lowry">Adam Lowry</a> and was for two games.</p>
      <p>There have been four fines issued this season (this is not the same thing as the salary forfeited under the suspension rules), and the maximum fine is 50% of one day’s salary. Two of the four fines issued were for the maximum allowed.</p>
      <p>The results of the hearing will be available within hours of it occurring, which will likely be Monday or Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Johnson left the game early, just as the goalie was pulled late in the third period.</p>
