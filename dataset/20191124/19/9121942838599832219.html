      <p>ROME (AP) — Slowly but surely, Claudio Ranieri is making an impression at Sampdoria.</p>
      <p>The Genoa team came back from a goal down for a 2-1 win over 10-man Udinese on Sunday for its second victory in six matches since Ranieri was hired to replace the fired Eusebio Di Francesco.</p>
      <p>A more telling statistic is that Sampdoria has lost only once since Ranieri was hired — having lost six of its seven games under Di Francesco.</p>
      <p>“When I arrived, Sampdoria had conceded a lot of goals. I’m used to setting up teams so they’re solid, don’t lose often and that can help increase confidence,” Ranieri said.</p>
      <p>A majestic free kick from Manolo Gabbiadini and a penalty from Gaston Ramirez — following a foul on Fabio Quagliarella — provided the goals for Sampdoria.</p>
      <p>It’s been a difficult campaign for Quagliarella after topping the league scoring chart last season but Ranieri seemed more impressed with Ramirez.</p>

      <p>“I wanted Ramirez at Leicester City and we spent a month trying to convince him to stay (at Sampdoria),” said Ranieri, who led the Foxes to the Premier League title in 2016. “He knew that I believed in him regardless of his playing time so far at Sampdoria, so we just had to wait for the right moment.”</p>
      <p>Sampdoria, which was in last place when Ranieri was hired, climbed to 16th place and three points clear of the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>GABIGOL PRICE RISES</p>
      <p>The late brace from Gabriel Barbosa that secured Flamengo a 2-1 over River Plate in the Copa Libertadores final on Saturday must have put a smile on the face of Inter Milan sporting director Giuseppe Marotta.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old Barbosa, who is known as “Gabigol,” is on loan from Inter.</p>
      <p>Flamengo reportedly rejected Inter’s price of 22 million euros ($25 million) for Barbosa’s full contract a month ago, and he is now likely worth closer to 40 million euros.</p>
      <p>Barbosa has scored 31 goals in 38 matches for Flamengo this season</p>
      <p>After playing briefly for Inter in 2016-17, Barbosa has been loaned out three times, starting with Benfica in 2017 and followed by Santos last year. His current loan spell at Flamengo expires Dec. 31.</p>

      <p>BARELLA SURGERY</p>
      <p>Inter announced Sunday that midfielder Nicolò Barella requires right knee surgery.</p>
      <p>Barella was injured during Inter’s 3-0 win at Torino a day earlier.</p>
      <p>Barella joined Inter from Cagliari during the offseason in a deal that could end up being worth nearly 50 million euros ($56 million), including bonuses.</p>
