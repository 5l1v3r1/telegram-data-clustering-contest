      <p>Local mental health awareness company You Are Collective is bringing an open mic night focused on mental health to Spaces in the Kelowna Innovation Centre on Nov. 28.</p>
      <p>You are Collective uses apparel and lived experiences to build awareness for mental health. In 2018 they raised more than $2,000 for services through events and sales.</p>
      <p>The Spaces working hub is a new home for working professionals in downtown Kelowna, boosting the Okanagan tech community.</p>
      <p>According to You Are Collective, young professionals and entrepreneurs in their twenties experience an overall decrease in their mental well-being while many of them cannot get the care they require because of financial or accessibility reasons.</p>
      <p>Spaces and You Are Collective hopes by teaming up to bring more awareness to this issue while providing free resources they can establish a non-judgmental community where individuals feel safe sharing their stories.</p>
      <p>You Are Collective hopes this will be the start of a series of collaborations with local businesses and venues to promote mental health.</p>
      <p>Guests are encouraged to share their experiences through monologues, poems, songs or any other creative ways they desire.</p>
      <p>Those not wanting to participate in the open mic can show their support in the audience and engage in meaningful conversations about mental health while also browsing the You Are Collective's new apparel collection.</p>
      <p>The event will take place between 5 and 7 p.m. and local comedian Paige Mathison will also be attending to kick off the night with a performance at 5:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Free tickets are available <a href="https://trellis.org/safe-spaces">here</a>, and food and toy donations will also be accepted towards the Spaces holiday drive.</p>
