      <p><b>London</b><b>:</b> Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he would remain neutral in a future Brexit referendum if Labour wins power. He told a BBC Question Time leaders’ special he would not campaign for Leave or Remain so it would allow him, as prime minister, to “credibly” carry out what the voters then decide.</p>
      <p>UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson later asked how Corbyn could be “indifferent” on such a vital issue. But Johnson faced questions of his own about whether he could be trusted. The Prime Minister was the fourth party leader to answer the audience’s questions, with the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson also taking to the stage for 30 minutes each, the BBC reported on Friday.</p>
      <p>Pressed on whether politicians should be relied upon, to tell the truth, Johnson said this was “absolutely vital”. While trust was a crucial issue for voters, he argued the biggest threat to public confidence was the “corrosive” effect of Parliament trying to block Brexit. He said the Labour, SNP and Lib Dem leaders wanted to “basically frustrate” the result of the 2016 referendum, which the public had been waiting more than three years to see delivered, by “absurdly” holding another one. He said that the Labour leader’s views seemed to have “mutated” and Corbyn’s ambition to negotiate an improved agreement would be totally undermined if he did not care whether the public backed it or not. “He is now going to be neutral on the deal he proposes to do. I don’t see how he can do a deal when he is going to be neutral or indifferent.”</p>
      <p>The Conservative leader also dismissed suggestions he was trying to suppress the findings of a report into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 referendum vote as “Bermuda triangle stuff”. “There is no evidence whatsoever, that I know of, to show any interference in any British electoral event,” he said.
