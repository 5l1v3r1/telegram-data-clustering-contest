        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> is quite literally giving her sister Kylie Jenner a run for her money, as the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is reportedly on her way to becoming a billionaire thanks to SKIMS.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 39-year-old launched the shapewear brand in September and it’s said to have revolutionised the fashion industry with its variety of body-snatching underwear catering for ‘every body’ type.</p>
      <p>SKIMS had a huge restock on Wednesday and it was clearly in high demand with<a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/24/kim-kardashian-west-skims-solutionwear-billion-idea/"> TMZ reporting</a> it earned millions of dollars within minutes of release.</p>
      <p>It’s claimed more than a million people were on the waitlist for the restock and the most popular sizes and styles sold out immediately.</p>
      <p>According to sources, it takes so long for SKIMS to restock because the company produce their own fabric that is exclusive to the brand. This is reportedly what makes the brand so unique when stacked up against its competitors.</p>

      <p>Due to the instant success of SKIMS, there are talks for Kim to release a male line of similar shapewear.</p>
      <p>In addition to SKIMS, Kim’s other brands including KKW Beauty and her perfume collections have also enjoyed healthy sales in recent months.</p>

      <p>Clearly all the incessant Instagram promotion is quite literally paying off.</p>
      <p>If Kim does manage to reach that billion-dollar mark, she’ll be in good company as her sister Kylie, 22, saw her Kylie Cosmetics brand valued at $1.2 billion earlier this year.</p>

      <p>However, the businesswoman <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/kylie-jenner-sells-cosmetics-company-share-600m-becoming-youngest-self-made-billionaire-11176988/">sold the majority share of the company this month to Coty</a> for an eye-watering $600 million, although she still maintains creative control.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/kim-kardashian-designs-skims-body-tape-avoid-worst-fashion-nightmare-11090154/">Kim introduced SKIMS body tape to the range</a> so women can wear low-cut outfits without the fear of a boob mishap.</p>
      <p>The reality TV star proudly said of her latest creation: ‘I haven’t really seen a tape that’s out there that was in different variety of new colours, so I’m excited to launch these really soon along with our nipple covers.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I wish @skims tape existed because I will find pictures of my ripped skin once I took the tape off!’ before later adding: ‘It was important to make sure our @skims tape is gentle when removing.’</p>
