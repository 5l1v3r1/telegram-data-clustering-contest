      <p>The months following the Patidar agitation in 2015 saw emergence of many youth leaders like <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/hardik-patel/">Hardik Patel</a>, Alpesh Thakor and Jignesh Mevani. Along with them another young leader had also emerged – 29-year-old Pravin Ram who had raised the issue of fixed wage employees of the state government. After a lull, Ram has again become active in public life for the past couple of months. He had held a couple of yatras. His return to active public life has sparked speculations about his political ambitions and sources do not rule out possibility of him joining a political party in future.</p>

        <b>Race for the top post</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the run up to the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a>’s traditional restructuring of the state unit in December, speculations are rife that the party is likely to have a Patidar as the next Gujarat BJP president. Either current party president Jitu Vaghani will get another term or a prominent Patidar party leader will be appointed. Sources say that former home minister Rajni Patel is also leading the race. Another name doing the rounds for the top post is that of another former home minister, Gordhan Zadaphia, who is working very hard for a political resurrection.</p>
