      <p>A young family with a newborn baby have lost everything weeks before <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/little-scots-girl-asks-warm-20935070">Christmas</a> after a fire ripped through their home.</p>
      <p>Sophie Duffy and Daniel Taylor and their <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/stv-star-living-cancer-becomes-20949640">baby daughter</a> , Ruby, have been left with nothing following the blaze at their home in Whitburn, West Lothian, last night.</p>
      <p>In a desperate bid for help, Sophie took to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/more-300000-people-register-vote-20942636">social media</a> to share their heartbreaking story.</p>
      <p>On Facebook she wrote: "Due to Daniel Taylor and I's house going on fire we have totally lost everything.</p>
      <p>"All our clothes and all our baby daughter's belongings.</p>
      <p>"If anyone known anyone who has anything that could help us out, we would be forever grateful."</p>

      <p>Daniel's sister-in-law, Kelly Taylor set up a Go Fund Me page to raise money for the young family.</p>
      <p>In a statement on the page Kelly wrote: "My brother-in-law, Daniel, his partner, Sophie and my baby niece, Ruby lost their home and all their belongings after their home went on fire on Saturday, November 23. </p>
      <p>"They have literally lost everything. </p>
      <p>"They have no clothes, no baby stuff or anything left at all. </p>
      <p>"I am fundraising to support them to rebuild and replace all their belongings. </p>
      <p>"We would appreciate any donations that you can spare to help. </p>
      <p>"Thankyou."</p>
