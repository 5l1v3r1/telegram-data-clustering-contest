      <p>A <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/conservative-party/">Conservative Party</a> candidate retweeted a post that claimed far-right activist Tommy Robinson had been jailed for ‘reporting on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/muslim/">Muslim</a> paedophiles’.</p>
      <p>Karl McCartney is the Conservative Party candidate for Lincoln.</p>
      <p>He also appeared to endorse a post which said the government had ‘made it illegal’ to expose Asian grooming gangs after Robinson was jailed for contempt of court, the Mirror reported.</p>
      <p>It comes just days after Conservative Party leader <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> said the party had a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to Islamophobia.</p>
      <p>Mr McCartney, who was Lincoln’s MP between 2010 and 2017, also shared a letter from Tommy Robinson, in which Robinson says his murder by ‘Muslim prison gangs’ would lead to a revolution.</p>
      <p>The former MPs social media history was uncovered by Hope Not Hate, the UK’s largest anti-racism charity, who called for Mr McCartney to be suspended.</p>

      <p>The chief executive of Hope not Hate Nick Lowles tweeted: ‘The Tory candidate for the highly marginal seat of Lincoln has repeatedly retweeted the thoughts of anti-Muslim bigots.</p>
      <p>‘This man does not deserve to be an MP.’</p>

      <p>A spokesperson for the Muslim Council of Britain said: ‘It is quite clear that Karl McCartney’s endorsement of Islamophobes renders him unfit to be an MP.</p>
      <p>‘Having been forced out once before, it is astounding that this man should be allowed to stand again.</p>
      <p>‘This is far from the zero tolerance on Islamophobia as promised by the Prime Minister last week.</p>
      <p>‘The Conservative Party should put these words into action by expelling Mr McCartney and the many other candidates found to be promoting Islamophobia and the far right.</p>
      <p>‘This is yet another episode which underscores once again the need for a specific and independent inquiry into this specific form of bigotry in the Conservative Party.’</p>
      <p>Mr McCartney told the Mirror: ‘I apologise unreservedly. In no way do I endorse the tweets or the accounts behind them. I accept retweeting them was ill-judged and could cause offence.</p>
      <p>‘This divisive figure has no place in our politics or public life.’</p>
