        <b>Residents are expressing their concern over proposals to drastically increase the number of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) that can go in and out of a Suffolk quarry.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hadleigh Quarry, in Aldham Mill Hill in the town, is currently restricted to 1,000 HGV movements in a calendar year.</p>
      <p>However, a planning application submitted on behalf of owners JT Few Plant Hire Ltd says the limit "effectively prevents the whole quarry operating at a commercial level of activity".</p>
      <p>The application has been submitted to increase the number of HGV movements, both into and out the quarry, to 80 per day over any four-week period,<b> </b>and to install floodlights.</p>
      <p>If the plans are approved, there would be a HGV leaving or arriving at the quarry every seven minutes on average during the quarry's working hours.</p>
      <p>A supporting transport statement said the alterations "would not have a significant effect on the local road network".</p>
      <p>JT Few Plant Hire said an increase in HGV movements would have a "negligible" impact on noise in Aldham Mill Hill due to a previously-installed noise barrier.</p>
      <p>Concluding, the statement said the need for increased movements "reflects the current upturn in the economy".</p>
      <p>JT Few Plant Hire said the alterations are essential to enable existing operations at the quarry to continue.</p>
      <p>Ray Austin, who lives nearby on Aldham Mill Hill, expressed his concerns to the plans.</p>
      <p>Mr Austin also refuted some of the findings of the transport report, believing the current infrastructure is not suitable for such a sharp increase of HGVs.</p>
      <p>He said: "The main concern is that the road is not suitable for the traffic.</p>
      <p>"It's not wide enough and will be a big safety hazard.</p>
      <p>"If they are going to allow the plans, they need to widen the roads."</p>
      <p>He continued: "There's also going to be an increase in the amount of noise."</p>
      <p>Mr Austin was also concerned about the volume of movements and said: "I'm not trying to stop the quarry working - but the plans need to be safe and sensible."</p>
