      <p>There have been rumours that beneficiaries of the N-Power scheme will be sacked after the payment of the October 2019 stipend, Concise News has learned.</p>
      <p>This news medium understands that beneficiaries of the N-Power scheme have not been paid their October 2019 stipend by the federal government.</p>
      <p>This has caused groaning among the beneficiaries as well as speculations that the scheme is coming to an end.</p>
      <p>According to one of the speculations making the rounds among beneficiaries, President Muhammadu Buhari’s government is too broke to carry on with the scheme.</p>
      <p>The rumour noted that it was the lack of finance that caused the delay in the payment of the October 2019 stipend, with the government no longer interested in continuing with it.</p>
      <p>However, checks by this news platform understands that (as at the time of this report), the government has not made any statement to that effect.</p>
      <p>In fact, there has not been any official statement about the delay in the payment of the October 2019 stipends.</p>
      <p>Beneficiaries of the N-Power scheme are thus urged to disregard the rumour as the scheme has not said it would sack them.</p>
