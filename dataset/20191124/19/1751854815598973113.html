      <p>IFTTT is one of a kind service that improves the users’ productivity in several ways one can imagine. It can integrate your devices, services, and apps to automate tasks as per your wish. The service is free to use unless you want to use if for your business.</p>

      <p>The software service derives its name from the most common ‘If’ jargon from the programming languages. And thus, IFTTT stands for ‘If This Then That’ and is pronounced as ‘gift’ without ‘g’.</p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, IFTTT helps you connect all your services, devices, and apps in such a way they can initiate tasks automatically. These automated tasks are possible due to ‘applets’ which are nothing but a combination of the things mentioned earlier, performing some tasks. You can enable or disable the applets either from the official website or app. Additionally, IFTTT also lets you create an applet of your own, giving you complete freedom.</p>
      <p>To use IFTTT, you will need an account that can be created for free from the official website or through the app, which is available for both Android and iOS platforms. After that, browse through the vast catalogue of applets and use the ones you need. The applets can be managed from both the website and the official app.</p>
      <p>Now, as we are done with some basic introduction about IFTTT, let us look at some of the best IFTTT applets that can improve your productivity.</p>
