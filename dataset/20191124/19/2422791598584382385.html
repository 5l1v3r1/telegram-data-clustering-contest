      <p>OTTAWA -- Federal lawyers will be in court on Monday to argue the government's appeal of a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling that ordered Ottawa to pay billions of dollars in compensation to First Nations children and their families.</p>
      <p>The tribunal's September ruling came shortly before the start of the federal election campaign.</p>
      <p>It ordered the federal government to pay $40,000 for every First Nations child who was inappropriately taken away from their parents after 2006.</p>
      <p>The Assembly of First Nations estimated that 54,000 children and their parents could be eligible for total compensation that could exceed $2 billion.</p>
      <p>The government has said it planned to appeal the damage award because the timing of the election campaign made it impossible to organize compensation by a Dec. 10 deadline.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Justice Department lawyers will ask the Federal Court for a stay of execution of the tribunal's order during the first of two days of hearings set aside for the case.</p>
