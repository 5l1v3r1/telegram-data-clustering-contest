      <h1>The Betting Line For The Ohio State-Michigan Game Is Set</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:34:42+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State clinched the Big Ten East and a spot in the conference title game with yesterday’s win over Penn State. There’s one game left for the Buckeyes, and it’s at Michigan.</p>
      <p>“The Game” is always an anticipated matchup, and this year is no exception. Ohio State is 11-0 and will be ranked either first or second in the College Football Playoff rankings on Tuesday. As for Michigan, there might not be any team in the country hotter than the 9-2 Wolverines.</p>
      <p>Since the second half of the loss to Penn State, Michigan has looked like a completely different team. Jim Harbaugh’s bunch has dominated four straight opponents, outscoring Notre Dame, Maryland, Michigan State and Indiana 166-45.</p>
      <p>As game week begins, the newest betting line for Ohio State-Michigan has been released, courtesy of Circa Sports.</p>
      <p>Las Vegas likes Ryan Day’s team to win fairly comfortably. The Buckeyes are nine-point favorites.</p>

      <p>Ohio State has not lost to Michigan since 2011, when Luke Fickell was the Buckeyes’ interim head coach. Jim Harbaugh has yet to beat OSU since taking over the Wolverines’ program.</p>
      <p>Will that change on Saturday?</p>
      <p>Las Vegas doesn’t think so.</p>
      <p>Ohio State and Michigan will kick off at noon E.T. on FOX.</p>
