      <h1>Kyoto Animation's Studio 1 to be Demolished Following Arson Attack</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:11:49+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:11</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Dominguez</a></address>
      <p>Renowned anime studio <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/kyoto-animation/">Kyoto Animation</a> is currently preparing for the demolition of its first studio building following the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/kyoto-japanese-animation-studio-arson-fire/">tragic arson attack</a> that took place there over the summer.</p>
      <p>As reported by <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20191124/k10012188981000.html">NHK</a>, Kyoto Animation's Studio 1 -- located in the Fushimi ward of Kyoto, Japan -- will be demolished early next year. Preparation work for the demolition, which includes building scaffolding and emptying out the building, is scheduled to begin tomorrow and is expected to last through the end of this year. The demolition itself is expected to begin in January and last through April.</p>

      <p>The fire at Kyoto Animation's Studio 1 building began on the morning of July 18, killing 36 people and injuring 33 others. Kyoto Prefectural Police are investigating the case as arson, having apprehended a 41-year-old man who allegedly used gasoline to start the fire. However, the suspect has yet to be formally arrested, as he was one of the 33 injured and is still recovering in the hospital.</p>
      <p>While certainly unfortunate, given the circumstances, the decision to have Studio 1 demolished is not a surprising one. Two days after the attack, Kyoto Animation President Hideaki Hatta discussed the possibility of demolishing the studio and building a public park in its place, which would include a monument to those lost. Said Hatta, "When I consider the staff and the people in this neighborhood, there are people who don't want to see such a gruesome sight." Hatta elaborated his thoughts at a press conference in October, adding, "It truly pains my heart whenever I see that treasured building in that state."</p>

      <p>That being said, <i>NHK</i> reports that Kyoto Animation has yet to reach a final decision regarding what it plans to do following Studio 1's demolition next year. However, the studio did hold a public memorial service for the victims of the attack at the Miyako Messe event hall in Kyoto on Nov. 3 and 4.</p>
