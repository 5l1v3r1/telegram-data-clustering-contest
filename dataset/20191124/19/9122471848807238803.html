      <h1>Video: Texas A&amp;M Should Be Very Afraid Of Coach O</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:22:49+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>One team is standing in the way of a perfect regular season for Ed Orgeron and the LSU Tigers. It just so happens to be the team that beat them in the wildest game of the 2018 season.</p>
      <p>LSU is set to play Texas A&amp;M on Saturday evening. The Tigers lost to the Aggies, 74-72, in seven overtimes last season.</p>
      <p>Coach O seems determined to not let that happen again.</p>
      <p>“There’s no question. There’s no question about that,” Orgeron said after LSU’s win over Arkansas. “It’s going to be on.”</p>
      <p>“I’ll never forget that game last year. We’re going to be ready.”</p>

      <p>That is not a head coach you want to be facing right now.</p>
      <p>LSU has opened as a 15-point favorite over Texas A&amp;M on Saturday night. The Tigers and the Aggies will kick off at 7 p.m. E.T.</p>
      <p>The game will be on ESPN.</p>
