      <h1>Satanism scare after stabbed animals found in New Forest</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:10:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/greg-wilford/" target="_blank">Greg Wilford</a></address>
      <p>It is an ancient woodland where a secret society of witches allegedly <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/hampshire/new-forest/articles/National-Park-focus-the-New-Forest/">met to practice magic eight decades ago. </a></p>
      <p>But now a vicar fears modern-day Satanists may be slaying animals in Hampshire's New Forest National Park, after several sheep and cattle were stabbed there earlier this month.</p>
      <p>One sheep was found dead with a cross and a pentagram, a symbol associated with magic, spray painted on to its body near the village of Bramshaw. </p>
      <p>Days later, Reverend David Bacon was told that an inverted cross and the number 666 had been scrawled on the door of his church in the civil parish, St Peter's.</p>
      <p>Rev Bacon said: "I've been told one of the symbols was a 666 which of course is a biblical sign of the devil, or Satan, so it could have [sinister overtones].</p>
      <p>"I've been here 15 years and seen a lot of stuff, but nothing like this.</p>
      <p>"It could just be kids, but I don't think it is, given the context.</p>
      <p>"There's been witchcraft round here for hundreds of years - the New Forest is well known for witchcraft and black magic happening, and this has obviously gone up a level."</p>
      <p>Judy Rudd, who has lived in the New Forest for 40 years, was out walking her two dogs in Bramshaw when she came across the dead sheep.</p>
      <p>Mrs Rudd said: "It had purple and green aerosol symbols sprayed on it. It was a pentagram and a cross. It had been stabbed to death. The wounds were in the side of the body by the rib cage.</p>
      <p>"It was very unpleasant... Some people think it's sinister."</p>
      <p>Her husband Julian added: "I don't agree that it's done to shock - you don't go around knifing animals simply to shock people.</p>
      <p>"It's related to something other than simply a desire to injure animals - it's either witchcraft or whatever. It's rather worrying."</p>
      <p>The New Forest became associated with witchcraft after the author and occultist Gerald Gardner, who died aged 79 in 1964, claimed a group of witches held meetings there in the early 20th century.</p>
      <p>Stretching over 220sq miles of southwest Hampshire and southeast Wiltshire, it has a mosaic of habitats including lowland wet and dry heaths, mires and bogs and ancient woodland. </p>
      <p>Farmers and residents have maintained a tradition of letting their animals roam free in the forest, which they are entitled to do under common rights dating back to the 13th Century.</p>
      <p>Three calves were found with stab wounds at Linwood, while two sheep were fatally slashed and marked at Bramshaw between November 16 and 20. </p>
      <p>Hampshire Police said it is investigating whether the "unusual" incidents are linked. </p>
      <p>Sgt Andy Williams, from the force's Country Watch team, said: "These incidents are unusual in the New Forest. We are looking at the circumstances of each one to see if they are linked, and to see how these animals came to be injured.</p>
      <p>"We would also urge anyone who uses the Forest, including Commoners, to be vigilant."</p>
      <p>Tony Hockley, chair of the New Forest Commoners' Defence Association, warned the attacks will have a profound impact on the community for years to come.</p>
      <p>He said: "We look out for each other. There are 700 commoners always looking out for each other and each other's animals.</p>
      <p>"Things like this will deter people from carrying on the tradition of grazing animals on the forest and that hurts everyone."</p>
      <p>Animal charity RSPCA said: "We are very concerned about how these animals died so would urge anyone with information to contact police who are investigating."</p>
