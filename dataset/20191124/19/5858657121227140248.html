      <p>HALIFAX — A former president of Ukraine has weighed in on the ongoing American impeachment inquiry by confirming he met with President Donald Trump’s prominent adviser in late 2017.</p>
      <p>But Petro Poroshenko told a security conference in Halifax he and Rudy Giuliani talked only about U.S. support, and insisted Giuliani did not ask for anything in return.</p>
      <p>Poroshenko says he spoke with Giuliani about increasing American support for the Ukrainian military, cybersecurity and financial reforms.</p>
      <p>Poroshenko’s account of the meeting came under intense scrutiny at the annual Halifax International Security Forum because of the close connection between Ukrainian politics and the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>The impeachment process started after a whistleblower alleged that during a July 25 telephone call, U.S. President Donald Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymur Zelensky he would withhold military aid unless Zelensky agreed to investigate former Vice-President Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>The whistle-blower and other U.S. officials have accused Trump of using the power of his office to illegally solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.</p>
      <p>Poroshenko says Giuliani promised to increase U.S. co-operation with Ukraine — but he insisted Giuliani never mentioned Biden.</p>
