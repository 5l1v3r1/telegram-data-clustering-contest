      <h1>The Betting Line For The Alabama-Auburn Game Is Set</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:37:05+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The Iron Bowl is next weekend but the stakes of the annual Alabama-Auburn game are far lower than usual. Both teams are out of the SEC title race, but Alabama still needs a win to potentially get into the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>The two teams are coming off dominating wins over FCS foes. They beat Western Carolina and Samford respectively by a combined score of 118-3.</p>
      <p>But the bettors seem to think that we’re in for a very close game.</p>
      <p>According to CircaSports via Michael Bratton, Alabama will open as a three point favorite on the road against Auburn.</p>

      <p>The winner of the Iron Bowl has gone on to play in the SEC Championship Game in each of the last seven seasons. But that won’t be the case this year as LSU has already punched its ticket to Atlanta.</p>
      <p>More than anything, Alabama quarterback Mac Jones will need to have a tremendous game to show the CFB Playoff voters that the Crimson Tide can still crush foes with him in place of injured starter Tua Tagovailoa.</p>
      <p>Auburn, meanwhile, will have no qualms at all about crushing their arch-rivals’ national title dreams. But after losses to LSU, Georgia, and Florida, you have to wonder whether Auburn has the talent to overcome a Tua-less Alabama team.</p>
