      <p>Peter Krajewski said he was on the boat and shared pictures of the scene at the port. <a href="https://twitter.com/VoodooMediaTV/status/1198670273693663232">He posted</a>, “Just got off the Norwegian Joy in the port of Los Angeles. Our ship had been dealing with a Norovirus outbreak the last couple of days, but none of the passengers suspected that it was as bad as it was. Apparently hundreds of people were acutely ill on the ship.”</p>
      <p>In a statement obtained by Fox News, a spokesperson for Norwegian Cruise Lines said, "The safety, security and well-being of our guests and crew is our number one priority. As such, we operate at the very highest public health standards. During Norwegian Joy’s Panama Canal sailing, a few guests onboard experienced a stomach-related illness. To mitigate any impact of this rare occurrence, we implemented stringent sanitation procedures. As always, we will continue to monitor this situation."</p>

      <p>In a statement obtained by the Mirror, the Los Angeles Fire Department said, “LAFD personnel continue to examine ‘several persons who have been ill’ while aboard the currently docked cruise ship, which is disembarking passengers. A yet to be determined number of those ill passengers desiring further medical assessment or ambulance transport are still being evaluated onshore by LAFD Paramedics. No patients are currently displaying life-threatening symptoms.”</p>
