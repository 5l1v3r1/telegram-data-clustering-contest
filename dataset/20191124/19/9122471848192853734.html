      <h1>Video: This Wild Throw From QB Carson Wentz Is Going Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:03:21+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The Philadelphia Eagles are fighting for their playoff lives in the last few games of the season. Their only realistic path to the playoffs is winning the division.</p>
      <p>But the Eagles will have a hard time beating anyone if Carson Wentz makes passes like the one he threw today.</p>
      <p>In the first quarter against the Seattle Seahawks, Wentz saw running back Miles Sanders wide open in the flats. But rather than throw a dart that could’ve let Sanders get a potential touchdown, he threw a duck that sailed over his head.</p>
      <p>Philadelphia was forced to settle for a field goal on that drive. The Seahawks quickly responded with a touchdown of their own to take the lead at Lincoln Financial Field.</p>

      <p>The wind had something to do with this, but still, bad wind or not, you almost never see an NFL quarterback make a throw like this:</p>

      <p>The Eagles are 5-5 on the year, only one game back from the Dallas Cowboys with four division games still to play.</p>
      <p>Every quarterback back a completely errant throw at one point or another. But considering how much money the Philadelphia Eagles are paying Carson Wentz, you’d hope he wouldn’t make any of those so soon after signing his extension…</p>
      <p>The game is being played on FOX.</p>
