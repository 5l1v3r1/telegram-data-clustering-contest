      <p>HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) — Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is laying the groundwork for a possible run for governor of Arkansas in 2022.</p>
      <p>Sanders say she hasn’t made a decision yet regarding a race that’s three years away. But she is headlining GOP dinners around the state where she was born and raised and returned to last summer.</p>
      <p>So far Sanders has stayed away from offering positions on many state issues, instead recounting her time in the White House for audiences.</p>
      <p>Sanders has name recognition in the state thanks to her high-profile job in Washington and the praise she receives from President Donald Trump. But she’s also known as the daughter of a long-serving former governor, Mike Huckabee.</p>
      <p>Sanders is a Fox News contributor and has a book coming out next year.</p>
