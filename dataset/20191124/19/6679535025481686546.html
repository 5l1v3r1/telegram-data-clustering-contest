      <p>The mosquito index in many wards in Thrikkakara had been found to be over 60. The mosquito index measured as Breteau Index is the number of larvae positive containers per 100 houses visited.

      <p>Source-reduction activity has been taken up in the municipality with ward councillors leading the works.</p>
