      <p>Well, we’ve been desperate for it to happen.</p>
      <p>And now after waiting years to get an Alzheimer’s ­treatment that might stop mental decline in its tracks – we may have found it.</p>
      <p>Doctors have welcomed a turning point in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease after the development of a drug apparently able to slow the ­condition if it’s caught early.</p>
      <p>Although the drug failed in trials initially, it could turn out to be the first effective treatment for the biggest single cause of dementia – though it’s early days yet.</p>
      <p>In a new assessment of more than 3,000 people, the drug, at high doses, relieved symptoms in patients who were caught early – they had 25% less mental decline after 18 months.</p>

      <p>Patients who took the new drug, aducanumab, had better cognition, memory and language and were able to live independently for longer, including performing household chores and travelling on their own.</p>
      <p>They also had lower levels of a toxic protein called amyloid beta in their brains. Wins all round.</p>
      <p>Anton Porsteinsson, director of the University of Rochester’s Alzheimer’s programme in New York state and lead investigator in the study, said it provides new hope for families.</p>
      <p>“There’s a tremendous un-met need and the Alzheimer’s ­community has been waiting for this moment,” he said.</p>
      <p>Experts are excited.</p>
      <p>At Alzheimer’s Research UK, chief executive Hilary Evans said: “People affected by Alzheimer’s have waited a long time for a life-changing new treatment and this exciting announcement offers new hope that one could be in sight.”</p>
      <p>James Pickett at Alzheimer’s Society believes the drug has “the potential to be a transformative discovery”.</p>

      <p>The news is welcome after five years in which drug companies have watched promising treatments fail in their final stages, leading some firms to pull out of the field entirely.</p>
      <p>The lack of success wasn’t only ­frustrating on its own terms but implied the entire approach to the disease, which rests on targeting the toxic brain protein amyloid beta, could be wrong.</p>
      <p>Bart de Strooper, director of the UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL, said the drug trial could re-energise the field.</p>
      <p>“It is fantastic to hear of these new positive results emerging from trials,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We have no ­effective treatments to slow or halt the progression of ­Alzheimer’s disease and I hope this signifies a turning point.”</p>
      <p>We now believe that treating people before they have symptoms, will the most effective way of preventing decline in the future.</p>
