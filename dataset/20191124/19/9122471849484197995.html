      <h1>Breaking: Greg Schiano Will Not Be Rutgers’ Head Coach</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:39:04+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>There will be no reunion between Rutgers and Greg Schiano, according to Yahoo’s Pete Thamel. The two sides could not come to an agreement.</p>
      <p>Schiano and Rutgers had been in negotiations for some time. The former Rutgers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach was one of two candidates to interview for the position, along with former Cincinnati and Tennessee head coach Butch Jones.</p>
      <p>Thamel reported the news moments ago.</p>

      <p>Schiano had the backing of multiple prominent Rutgers boosters, but in the end, he will not be heading back to Piscataway.  According to Watch Stadium’s Brett McMurphy, Rutgers offered Schiano an eight-year, $32 million contract, though those numbers are unconfirmed by The Spun.</p>

      <p>We can confirm is that Rutgers AD Patrick Hobbs was not a fan of hiring Schiano from the outset of the process, though McMurphy’s reporting seems to pin the onus on the deal not being consummated on Schiano.</p>
      <p>As the AD, Hobbs certainly has the right to make the pick, but by not delivering Schiano, he has likely sealed his fate. He won’t last long in that position.</p>
      <p>Expect to see a massive decrease in fan support for a program that was already feeling the effects of five consecutive losing seasons.</p>
      <p>According to NJ.com, Rutgers <a href="https://www.nj.com/rutgersfootball/2019/11/what-could-plan-b-for-rutgers-greg-schiano-look-like-2-names-1-potential-landing-spot-to-watch.html">could now turn to</a> Michigan linebackers coach Anthony Campanile and Los Angeles Rams assistant coordinator for offense Jedd Fisch as candidates. Campanile is a former Rutgers player, assistant coach and the younger brother of current Scarlet Knights interim head coach Nunzio Campanile.</p>
