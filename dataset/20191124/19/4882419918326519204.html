      <p>"I'm really shy and I don't feel comfortable going up and talking to people. I'm not someone who starts a conversation but Luis (Suarez), Leo (Messi) and I are beginning to learn about each other. We've already had dinner together," admitted Antoine Griezmann in an interview with UEFA.</p>
      <p>"Our relationship can only improve over time. And it's obvious that what happens on the pitch will only help us feel more comfortable amongst one another."</p>
      <p>On Messi specifically, Griezmann said: "He's a player that we won't see again in the next 40 years. We can only enjoy his football. Whether that's as his teammate, as supporters or his coach, because what he does with the ball is incredible. It's a real pleasure to watch him play."</p>
      <p>Griezmann believes there are some similarities between Barcelona and one of his former clubs Real Sociedad. "They don't look at your height or whether you're fast or not. The only thing that matters is your talent and what you can do with the ball at your feet. I believe it was good for me that I started there. I learnt a lot about keeping ahold of the ball and attacking football."</p>

      <p>WHY HE SIGNED FOR FC BARCELONA</p>
      <p>The French forward claims he didn't leave Atletico Madrid to win more titles but for footballing reasons.</p>
      <p>"I didn't leave Atletico to win the Champions League or more trophies. I came here to learn a new style of football, to adapt to a new philosophy and to improve and learn things on a personal level too."</p>
      <p>"The objective was to learn a new style of play at a club which sees football in a different way," added Griezmann. My goals are to learn something new because I have no doubts that Atleti could win LaLiga or the Champions League at any moment. Their team is very good and their coach too."</p>
      <h3>LACK OF CONFIDENCE</h3>
      <p>Part of that learning process depends on the player himself. "You have to watch your matches, see the chances, what you do when your team has the ball. You learn this way. Now I'm playing on the left, a new position for me, and I'm working hard to get used to it. I also need to learn how my teammates play. Everyone is new to me. I still don't know the runs of Suarez, Messi or Dembele. I'm trying to learn as quickly as possible because the team needs me but at times it's difficult. When I have the ball, I still lack the confidence to pass or shoot at the goal. But that will come in time," he insisted.</p>
