      <p>A ‘penny-pinching’ council billed a man for just 1p after his mother died.</p>
      <p>David Egerton, 69, says he was stunned to get the council tax bill through his letterbox.</p>
      <p>He criticised Isle of Wight Council for spending more than the value of the bill in delivery costs.</p>
      <p>His mum Molly died aged 93 in July but had not lived in her Newport home on the island since February as she spent her final months in a care home.</p>
      <p>Isle of Wight Council apologised for the ‘regrettable’ incident and claimed as a result of its calculations a ‘small amount’ was left owed.</p>
      <p>Mr Egerton, from Freshwater on the Isle of Wight, said: ‘I thought they couldn’t be serious.</p>

      <p>‘It is laughable, they are literally penny pinching. They have tried to get the last penny out of her.</p>

      <p>‘It must have cost them ten times the amount to send the letter to me.</p>
      <p>‘It smacks of Scrooge being in charge. I really hope they get to meet their three spirits soon.’</p>
      <p>An Isle of Wight Council spokesman said the payment is not being pursued.</p>
      <p>The spokesman said: ‘We would like to express our sincere condolences to the family and apologise that this situation has arisen.</p>

      <p>‘When closing an account, sometimes, due to the calculations, regrettably it can result in small amounts being left owing.</p>
      <p>‘We would not pursue payment for such a small amount.</p>
      <p>‘It would be our normal practice for the council tax bill to show that this is for information only, together with an explanation that the council is legally obliged to send a bill even for small amounts.</p>
      <p>‘It is with regret this did not happen on this occasion and we are very sorry for any distress this may have caused.’</p>
