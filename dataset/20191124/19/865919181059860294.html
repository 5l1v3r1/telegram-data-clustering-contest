      <p>Nashville Predators forward Viktor Arvidsson will miss four to six weeks after hurting his lower body when cross-checked during the first period of Saturday nightâ€™s 4-2 win over St. Louis.</p>
      <p>Bortuzzo was suspended for four games without pay on the NHL on Sunday. Considered a repeat offender under the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, Bortuzzo will forfeit $67,073.</p>
      <p>Arvidsson was cross-checked at 6:08 of the first period, with the Blues defenceman given only a 2-minute penalty. The Predators forward had an assist but played only 4:15 due to the hit.</p>
      <p>Nashville hosts St. Louis on Monday night.</p>
