      <h1>Is Katie Price pretending to be out with twelve year old daughter Princess?</h1>
      <h2>Katie claimed she and Princess were enjoying a day out together with a photo that bears a striking similarity to one from a fashion shoot that Princess posed for</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/katie-price">Katie Price</a> has fans scratching their heads with her Instagram story.</p>
      <p>The former glamour model, 41, shared a snap of 12 year old daughter Princess during what she claims was a day out together.</p>
      <p>"Day out with my Princess," mum of five Katie penned on the photo of her eldest daughter, one of two kids she shares with first husband Peter Andre.</p>
      <p>It might seem a perfectly ordinary photo to post - the only thing out of the ordinary is that it bears a great similarity to a fashion shoot Princess did.</p>
      <p>Princess, along with Katie's other daughter, five year old Bunny, is the face of online clothing boutique Princess &amp; Bunny.</p>

      <p>The one on Katie's story shows her in those same clothes, in the same spot.</p>
      <p>This comes after her estranged husband - and Bunny's dad - Kieran Hayler hinted he was upset with Katie for posting a picture of Bunny and brother Jett, six, that he'd already shared.</p>

      <p>"Never be intimidated by someone who copies you," a quote he shared read, "The original is always better than the copy."</p>
      <p>Katie also baffled fans with a post of Jett in the garden with big brother and Katie's eldest Harvey, writing: "Love Sunday mornings with my boys."</p>
      <p>Jett also appeared on Kieran's <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , prompting one fan to mock: "Those kids are remarkable; two places at once."</p>

      <p>A source recently told Mirror Online that 14 year old son Junior - her eldest with Peter - <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/katie-prices-son-junior-too-20629695">is "so embarrassed" by the mess of his mum's house</a> that he prefers to stay at his dad's.</p>
      <p>The source said: "He was so embarrassed by the mess of his mum's house and preferred Peter's cleaner house.</p>
      <p>"He is like any teenage boy and embarrasses easily so he just didn't visit the house. He still saw his mum but wouldn't stay overnight because he just couldn't stand the mess."</p>
      <p>They added that Katie's driving ban hasn't helped the situation, continuing: "Junior also needed to get to school and Katie not driving meant it was more difficult to get around."</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted representatives of Katie for comment.</p>
