      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T19:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/aaron-hinks/" target="_blank">Aaron Hinks</a></address>
      <p>The City of White Rock is to host an event this afternoon that will give residents a chance to be “mayor for the day.”</p>
      <p>The Waterfront Enhancement Strategy open house event, to take place at White Rock Community Centre (15154 Russell Ave.) from 2-5 p.m., will give residents a chance to use “play money” to share how they would budget resources for waterfront issues identified through a previous public and business consultation.</p>
      <p>“Help plan the Waterfront and Marine Drive in to the next 10 to 20 years,” the city announcement says.</p>
      <p>A second open house event is to take place Nov. 26 from 6-8 p.m. in the same location.</p>
