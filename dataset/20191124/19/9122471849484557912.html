      <p>This week’s College Football Playoff rankings will be revealed Tuesday night. The only real drama in the top four will be seeing if Ohio State’s win over Penn State was enough to move them past LSU and into the top spot.</p>
      <p>Outside of that, we’ll see how the committee sorts out the 5-through-7 spots, as those teams are the ones knocking on the door heading into championship weekend.</p>
      <p>Next weekend, we’ll finish off the 2019 regular season with several marquee rivalry matchups, including Ohio State-Michigan, Alabama-Auburn and Oklahoma-Oklahoma State.</p>
