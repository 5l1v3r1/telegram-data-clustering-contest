      <p>MILWAUKEE — Giannis Antetokounmpo continued to provide the offence, and the Bucks’ defence eventually caught up.</p>
      <p>Antetokounmpo had 28 points and 10 rebounds for his 16th consecutive double-double to lead Milwaukee past the Detroit Pistons 104-90 on Saturday night for its seventh straight victory.</p>
      <p>"There were different guys stepping up, making plays,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “I think the defence held them tonight. They’re a little banged up on a back-to-back. Unfortunate for them, but kind to us.”</p>
      <p>Wesley Mathews added 13 points and Eric Bledsoe had 11 for the Bucks, who improved their record to an Eastern Conference-best 13-3.</p>
      <p>Derrick Rose scored 20 points, Langston Galloway added 13 and Andre Drummond had 12 points and 17 rebounds for Detroit, which was without Blake Griffin.</p>
      <p>The star forward, who has played in just four games this season, was inactive for injury recovery after playing 32 minutes in a 128-103 victory over Atlanta on Friday in the first game of the back-to-back.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t change my approach. Coming into the game, my mindset is to win,” Antetokounmpo said. “Obviously, when you don’t have a guy like Blake that’s a really great player, and (has) a lot of experience playing, now you’ve got to figure out who you’re guarding and whose going to go against you.”</p>
      <p>Antetokounmpo is the first player to open the season with 16 double-doubles in a row since Moses Malone did it for the Houston Rockets in 1981.</p>
      <p>Antetokounmpo and George Hill hit consecutive 3-pointers to fuel a 12-0 run to open the fourth quarter and put Milwaukee in front 89-69. Detroit missed its first eight shots of the period before Langston Galloway finally hit a 3 with 5:47 remaining.</p>
      <p>“We had some ill-advised shots and didn't execute the way we should have,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “In those moments you’ve got to have a clear understanding of what you are trying to do. We didn't do that.”</p>
      <p>The Bucks used a 15-2 run midway through the third quarter to build a 71-54 lead. Detroit whittled it to 77-69 entering the final period.</p>
      <p>Casey said he thought fatigue played a factor, especially down the stretch. The Pistons shot 60% in the victory over Atlanta, but dipped to 41% against the Bucks.</p>
      <p>“Shooting is the first part you saw,” Casey said. “The same shots we were getting last night were all short. That is a back-to-back, but that is the whole NBA.”</p>
      <p>Hill’s 3-pointer at the buzzer put the Bucks up 54-47 at halftime. Milwaukee shot 51% in the first half, making 21 of 41 shots, but Detroit stayed close thanks to nine second-chance points.</p>
      <p>“A lot of this is such a two-way sport; offence takes care of the defence, defence takes care of the offence,” said Bucks guard Wesley Matthews. “We start taking care of the ball a little bit better, we had a lot of turnovers on our end, three I think, at least three myself, and it kind of puts the defence in a tough spot. But we responded, we compete and we’re always going to compete.”</p>
      <p>TIP-INS</p>
      <p>Detroit has four players who were with the Bucks last season: Tim Frazier, Thon Maker, Tony Snell and Christian Wood. “As I went through their depth chart I was like, wow, don’t remember having four from a previous team, previous season and then playing them,” Budenholzer said.</p>
