      <h1>Jane Fonda says she feels 'sad' for Trump</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T03:51:39+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 03:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rachel-frazin" target="_blank">Rachel Frazin</a></address>
      <p>Actress and environmental activist <a href="https://thehill.com/person/jane-fonda">Jane Fonda</a> said Saturday that she feels "sad" for <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> and said that he is "in bed with the fossil fuel industry."</p>
      <p>"I don't hate him. I feel sad for him," Fonda said of Trump in a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/23/politics/jane-fonda-trump-van-jones-cnntv/index.html?utm_term=image&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twCNNp&amp;utm_content=2019-11-24T03%3A05%3A04">CNN interview</a>. "And what he's doing to the world ... is just criminal. It's just criminal. It's terrible. But there's more of us, and we can make a difference."</p>
      <p>Fonda has made headlines in recent weeks after being <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/465429-jane-fonda-arrested-during-climate-change-protest-outside-capitol">arrested</a> in Washington while protesting inaction on climate change multiple times. </p>
      <p>She told CNN that when Trump was first elected, she wanted to get "a lot of very beautiful women who are very, very smart about climate" such as Pamela Anderson to show him the importance of the issue. </p>
      <p>She said that she talked with <a href="https://thehill.com/people/ivana-ivanka-trump">Ivanka Trump</a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/people/jared-kushner">Jared Kushner</a>, the president's advisers who are also his daughter and son-in-law respectively, but they did not follow up.  </p>
      <p>"He's a petroleum president," Fonda said. "They are so in bed with the fossil fuel industry that there's nothing that even Pamela Anderson could get out of Donald Trump."</p>

      <p>Trump this month commented on Fonda's arrests at a rally.  “They arrested Jane Fonda, nothing changes. I remember 30, 40 years ago they arrested her,” he said. “She always has the handcuffs on, oh man. She’s waving to everybody with the handcuffs." Fonda has been critical of Trump in the past and <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/414582-jane-fonda-compares-trump-to-hitler-while-urging-americans-to">compared him to Adolf Hitler last year</a>.  </p>
