      <p><b>Advice from experts: </b>Ramnath Kanakadandi, National CAT Course Director, T.I.M.E. said, “The CAT can be tamed by those who have put in the necessary hard work. You also need to keep the mind in control and not allow it to play tricks. Handling pressure well does help in adding to the CAT score. Focus on the alternatives too. Thinking that CAT is the only thing in their life will only create unnecessary pressure. Think of past successes and how you overcame hurdles to motivate yourself. On the last day, you should relax. Watch a movie! Go and enjoy. Take your mind off the exam. That actually helps. All the best!”</p>
