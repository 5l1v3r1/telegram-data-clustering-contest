      <h1>Week 12 Fantasy QB Rankings: Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold on the rise</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T03:44:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 03:44</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Lutovsky</a></address>
      <p>This is one of the strangest weeks for quarterback rankings. Not only are some usual starters dealing with tough matchups, but several unreliable signal-callers have favorable ones. You might be checking for second and third opinions on your start 'em, sit 'em decisions at this position, but our Week 12 fantasy QB rankings are a good place to start.</p>
      <p>Tom Brady (vs. Cowboys), Dak Prescott (@ Patriots), Aaron Rodgers (@ 49ers), Josh Allen (vs. Broncos), and Jared Goff (vs. Ravens) are all facing difficult matchups. Fantasy owners probably don't need to be talked out of starting Goff and maybe even Brady, but Prescott and Rodgers will be tough for many to bench.</p>

      <p>On the flip side, Jacoby Brissett (@ Texans), Baker Mayfield (vs. Dolphins) and Sam Darnold (vs. Raiders) are on the rise thanks to solid Week 11s and favorable matchups in Week 12. Jeff Driskel (@ Redskins), Dwayne Haskins (vs. Lions), Mason Rudoulph (@ Bengals), and whoever starts for the Bears (vs. Giants) also have favorable matchups, but you'd have to be really desperate (or ballsy) to start one of them -- with the possible exception of Driskel -- outside of DFS tournaments.</p>

      <p>We generally advocate playing the numbers when it comes to two talented QBs at the extreme ends of matchups (e.g. Prescott and Mayfield). But talent can easily win out, too, so it's tough to know the right answers before kickoff. We'll do our best below to help you through the process.</p>

Not much has changed for Houston's pass defense, as it still allows the sixth-most fantasy points per game (FPPG) to QBs. Even if T.Y. Hilton (calf) is out, Brissett will likely throw a bunch in a favorable matchup. </td>

Miami still sports a below-average defense that allows the fifth-most FPPG to QBs, so Mayfield should continue his late-season surge. </td>

            <b>11</b>
          </td>
          <td><b>Carson Wentz, PHI vs. SEA. </b>Wentz has been a disappointment this year, but the Seahawks rank 29th in sacks, which has been his (and the Eagles as a whole) biggest bug-a-boo. Assuming he gets time in the pocket, he can pick apart this suspect secondary that's allowed the fifth-most WR completions this season. </td>

            <b>12</b>
          </td>
          <td><b>Aaron Rodgers, GB @ SF. </b>This is a "revenge game" of sorts for local-boy Rodgers, who was passed over at No. 1 by Rodgers way back in 2005. Either way, this is a tough matchup, as San Francisco allows just 10.9 FPPG to QBs. That staid, they have given up legit points to Kyler Murray in two of the past three games, so it's not an impossible defense to score against. Davante Adams should be closer to fully healthy, and Rodgers always has upsde. </td>

          </td>
          <td><b>Dak Prescott, DAL @ NE. </b>Prescott has been great this year, but he's largely posted his biggest stats against bad defenses. New England has run up its gawdy defensive numbers in much the same way, but it's still allowing the fewest FPPG to QBs (7.9). Prescott did have a big game against Minnesota just two weeks ago, so it's not as if he can't produce, especially if he can pad his totals on the ground, but this is a tough spot for him, especially with Amari Cooper (knee) banged up. </td>

            <b>14</b>

          <td><b>Tom Brady, NE vs. DAL. </b>Brady has had only one mutli-TD outing is his past four games, and Dallas enters this one allowing just 14.4 FPPG to QBs. Like Prescott and Rodgers, Brady isn't in a good spot, but given his pedigree, it's also tough to ever count him out. </td>

            <b>16</b>
          </td>
          <td><b>Jared Goff, LAR vs. BAL. </b>Goff should get Brandin Cooks (concussion) and Robert Woods (personal) back, which could really open things up for him. However, his actual performance has been so subpar lately (zero TDs in three of his past five games, including each of his past two), it's tough to count on him against a surging defense that features former Ram Marcus Peters is the secondary. </td>

            <b>17</b>

          <td><b>Jeff Driskel, DET @ WAS. </b>Driskel posted three TDs last week and has at least 37 rushing yards in each of his first two games as Detroit's starter. There's a case to be made for him to be ranked even higher given Washington's suspect pass defense, but completions percentages below 59 percent each game have us worried. If things go south for Driskel, they'll really go south. </td>
