      <p>Former <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE </a>Superstar Sinn Bodhi recently <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/former-wwe-star-would-like-credit-for-inspiring-bray-wyatt-662565/anchor.fm/jordan-garber">appeared </a>on <i><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2DiagZyLjDqZwJOiLJcqG4">Jordan Garber's NOW</a></i> show, and discussed a string of Pro Wrestling topics. Bodhi, stated that the character of Bray Wyatt's "The Fiend" is influenced by the 'Kizarny' character from his WWE run, and he would like for Wyatt to acknowledge the same.</p>
      <p>Sinn Bodhi was signed to a WWE developmental contract back in 2007, and had a brief run in Florida Championship Wrestling. Two years later, he made his SmackDown Live debut by defeating MVP. Soon after, Kizarny was released from WWE. He has been an indie mainstay since his release.</p>

      <p>Bodhi had some bold words in regards to his 'Kizarny' character, and said that the gimmick influenced several future characters, one of those being Bray Wyatt's "The Fiend". Bodhi <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/former-wwe-star-would-like-credit-for-inspiring-bray-wyatt-662565">added</a> that he would like Bray to reference 'Kizarny' as an inspiration, so that it helps him in the indies.</p>
      <blockquote>"I have no problem with circus guys like Bray Wyatt doing anything in this business. I don't have a copyright, it's just that if someone wants to be influenced or borrow something be my guest, but just reference it and put over where you got an idea. I have so many influences on things I do that I don't take anything outright, I just take bits and pieces and morph it into myself. If he was to say Bodhi was where I got a lot of my stuff from, that would help stuff out from me with promoters."</blockquote>
