      <p>PHILADELPHIA, Nov 24 — Josh Richardson hit six 3-pointers and scored a season-high 32 points in his first game against his former team as the host Philadelphia 76ers routed the Miami Heat 113-86 yesterday.</p>
      <p>Richardson returned after missing the last two games with a right hip flexor strain to shoot 11 for 15.</p>
      <p>Joel Embiid had 23 points and 11 rebounds, Tobias Harris scored 19 points and Al Horford had 16.</p>
      <p>The Sixers have won four in a row and improved to 7-0 at home.</p>
      <p>Tyler Herro led the Heat with 20 points, Goran Dragic added 18, Bam Adebayo contributed 12 and Jimmy Butler had 11 on 4-for-13 shooting. It was Butler’s first game back in Philadelphia since being traded in the offseason as part of a four-team deal.</p>
      <p>The Sixers jumped out to a 28-8 lead and maintained that momentum for the remainder of the first half as they rolled to a 55-35 lead.</p>
      <p>Despite playing in the second leg of a back-to-back for the first time all season, Embiid looked fresh and finished the half with 13 points and eight rebounds.</p>
      <p>Butler, who was booed every time he touched the basketball, paced the Heat with 11 points on 4-of-11 shooting The Heat were 1 for 12 from beyond the 3-point arc with 11 turnovers.</p>
      <p>Philadelphia didn’t let up and opened the third quarter with 10 straight points to push their lead to 30 at 65-35. Embiid knocked down a pair of 3-pointers, Harris added two free throws and Richardson hit a layup, forcing Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra to call an early timeout.</p>
      <p>Richardson later added a trey and the Sixers lead was 73-38.</p>
      <p>The Heat scuffled throughout the entire third quarter and continued missing shots and committing turnovers. They trailed 92-59 at the end of the quarter as Herro hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer.</p>
      <p>Philadelphia kept the pressure on even with the huge lead and moved ahead 109-70 with 6:38 left when Mike Scott drained a deep 3-pointer. — Reuters</p>
