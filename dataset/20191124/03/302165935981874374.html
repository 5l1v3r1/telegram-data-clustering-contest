      <p>MEXICO CITY, Nov 24 — Broadcaster ESPN claimed a new world record for attendance at a tennis match yesterday, with more than 42,000 people watching Germany’s Alexander Zverev go down 6-3, 4-6, 2-6 to Roger Federer in an exhibition match in Mexico City.</p>
      <p>That smashed an almost decade-old record of 35,681 set at an exhibition game between Belgian Kim Clijsters and Serena Williams in Belgium in 2010.</p>
      <p>ESPN put the exact number of fans in Mexico City’s bullring at 42,517.</p>
      <p>Even before yesterday’s match, Federer had announced his intention to set a new world record for attendance when he meets Rafael Nadal in an exhibition match in South Africa in February.</p>
      <p>That duel will be staged at the Cape Town Stadium, which has a capacity of 55,000. It will also have the draw of a preceding doubles match in which Federer will partner Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Nadal will play alongside South African comedian Trevor Noah. — Reuters</p>
