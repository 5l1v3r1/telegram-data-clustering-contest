      <p>The Senior Pastor of Kingsword Ministries International Lagos, Pastor Kay Ijugbesan, has called on Nigerians to focus on God and depend on Him all time to overcome all forms of depression.</p>
      <p>Ijugbesan said this at the just -concluded annual convention of the church at its headquarters in Oregun, Lagos.</p>
      <p>The event tagged rest roundabout attracted together thousands of Christian faithful from across the world which feature song rendition, drama and prophetic ministration</p>
      <p>He said that there is an increasingly disturbing level of depression plaguing young people all over the world, which he said was borne out of many people not depending on God to help them to address their challenges.</p>
      <p>The cleric noted that only God knows that how many Hollywood stars have committed suicide in the last two years because of depression even after making millions of dollars.</p>
      <p>According to him: “Depression is beyond physical, it is spiritual and only focuses on God and his promises can help one to overcome depression in life.”</p>
      <p>Ijugbesan, who is also a pharmacist, said that depression most times crept into hormone and drain every ray of hope and purpose in life.</p>
      <p>He cited the scriptures of God miraculous intervention in the lives of the patriarch of old, stating that no matter what lives throws at us, we must learn to depend upon the Lord.</p>
      <p>He noted when Jesus was on a mission and there was storm in the boat, his disciples were anxious and worried but there worries could not still the storm until Jesus stepped in.</p>
