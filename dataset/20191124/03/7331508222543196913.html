      <p>MADISON, Wis. -- <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/275/wisconsin-badgers">Wisconsin</a>'s <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4242335/jonathan-taylor">Jonathan Taylor</a> set an FBS record, rushing for at least 200 yards for the 12th time in his career Saturday as the No. 12 Badgers beat <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2509/purdue-boilermakers">Purdue</a> 45-24 in their final home game of the season.</p>
      <p>The junior All-American running back had been tied with Wisconsin's Ron Dayne, Texas' Ricky Williams and USC's Marcus Allen for the FBS record of 11 games over 200 yards entering the day.</p>
      <p>After gaining 222 yards and scoring a touchdown on his 28 carries, Taylor walked around Camp Randall Stadium and thanked the home fans for their support.</p>
      <p>"It was something special, especially because you don't know. You don't know if you're going to be here again," Taylor said. "So I think that's the biggest thing is just being appreciative of that opportunity."</p>
      <p>Now with 5,856 career yards, the most by any player in FBS history through his junior season, Taylor has to decide following the season if he'll declare for 2020 <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft/news">NFL draft</a>. But in the meantime, Taylor said all he's thinking about is defeating Minnesota next week and winning the Big Ten West.</p>

      <p>"Next week, we wouldn't want to have it any other way," he said. "Big Ten West on the line, rivalry game, [playing for the] ax [trophy that's awarded to the winner], I mean, this is why you come to Wisconsin, for these kind of moments. I'm pretty sure we're going to have a great week of preparation in order to bring our A-game.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin improved to 9-2 overall and 6-2 in the Big Ten West with the victory, its 14th in a row over the Boilermakers.</p>
      <p>Taylor's 51-yard touchdown run with 1 minute, 30 seconds left in the first quarter -- his FBS-leading 22nd TD of the season -- gave the Badgers a 14-3 lead.</p>
      <p>The lone downside for Taylor was losing a pair of fumbles, bringing his season total to four and his career total to 14 in 38 games.</p>
