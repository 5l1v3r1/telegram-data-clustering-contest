      <p>Edmund clinched his third straight singles victory of the week on his third match point.</p>
      <p>Spain need world number one Rafael Nadal to get past Dan Evans in the second singles clash to set up a deciding doubles rubber between Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski and Marcel Granollers and Lopez.</p>
