      <p>Germany’s cartel authority said it was fining BMW, Volkswagen Group and Daimler a total of 100 million euros for unlawful actions in relation to steel purchases. A report by <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-fines-bmw-daimler-vw-over-steel-cartel/a-51356153"><i>DW</i></a> says that from 2004 to 2013, the automakers regularly met steelmakers and other companies in the supply chain to discuss uniform surcharges when purchasing steel.</p>
      <p>Germany’s competition watchdog, the Bundeskartellamt, says that unlawful prices resulting from the cartel were paid until at least 2016. BMW said it would pay a penalty amounting to 28 million euros. Daimler said it will have to pay 23.5 million euros. VW Group declined to comment on the amount it would pay.</p>
      <p>The cartel office said that purchasing prices for long steel products, the steel type affected by the cartel, account for less than 1 percent of a car’s final value. Long steel is used for crankshafts, gearwheels and steering rods.</p>
      <p>A separate investigation targeting several producers for “flat steel” price rigging is still ongoing. German media reports have suggested fines in that case could amount to €500 million.</p>
