      <p>SHAH ALAM, Nov 24 — PAS and Umno will form a new government to replace Pakatan Harapan (PH) only through legitimate means, the Islamist party’s president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang asserted.</p>
      <p>The Marang MP told a crowd numbering some 600 people at the Selangor Muafakat Nasional launch last night that the Opposition bloc was offered a chance to form the government through “back door” deals, but added that it would not do so.</p>
      <p>“Inshaallah, we will enter Putrajaya through the front, not the back door.</p>
      <p>“They opened the back door but we want to enter from the front,” he said, without disclosing the identities of those who made the offer.</p>
      <p>“If the back door is open, then chaos will reign, which has resulted the confusion we see now in Pakatan Harapan,” Hadi added.</p>
      <p>The PAS leader praised his Umno counterpart Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamid, whom he said was like-minded in wanting to “save” Malaysia without resorting to immoral tactics.</p>
      <p>“We want changes in the country. We are not power hungry but we want to save the country,” he claimed.</p>
      <p>Talks of PAS and Umno forming a “back door” government have been circulating for a while, starting with rumours that former Umno vice-president Datuk Hishammuddin Hussein was attempting to engineer a deal with PKR and Bersatu to ditch their PH partners Amanah and DAP.</p>
      <p>It resurfaced following a leaked midnight meeting of several Umno and PKR MPs at PKR deputy president and Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Azmin Ali’s house in Putrajaya last week.</p>
      <p>Azmin and PKR leaders in attendance have since denied allegations of a secret plot, saying the meeting was a discussion with the Opposition lawmakers who were interested in PH’s economic plans for the country.</p>
      <p>However, PH chairman and Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad continued to fan the rumours by saying the Umno MPs who met Azmin last Monday night were “lost” and in need of a new party — a claim since refuted by 15 of them.</p>
      <p>Last month, 18 PAS MPs and six from Umno declared support for Dr Mahathir to serve out a full term despite the PM’s promise to relinquish control of the government mid-way to PKR president and Port Dickson MP Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim who is not a part of the current Cabinet.</p>
