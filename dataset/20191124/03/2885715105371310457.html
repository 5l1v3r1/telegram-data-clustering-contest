      <p>Two days after the body of a five-year-old boy was found in a gunny bag near a drain in North East Delhi, police have arrested his mother and two other men for allegedly strangulating the child and dumping the body.</p>
      <p>Police said the woman told them that she couldn’t attend to the child’s needs, so she killed him. DCP (North East) Ved Prakash Surya said the officers found an unidentified child’s body lying near a drain in Khajuri Khas Thursday. “We scanned the CCTV footage and found that a Maruti Eeco had stopped at the spot and a woman dumped a yellow gunny bag into the drain. The van had a big sticker on its back, but the visuals weren’t clear.”</p>
      <p>Police said that over 200 Eeco vans were searched before they found the one with a similar sticker. The driver of the vehicle confessed to the crime, said police.</p>
      <p>“He told us that his cousin and the child’s mother are friends, and that they killed the child,” said a police officer.</p>
      <p>Police said all of them have been arrested.</p>
      <p>“The woman got angry at the child and beat him. After the child fell unconscious, she strangulated him. They later roped in the car owner, who helped dispose of the body,” said police.</p>
