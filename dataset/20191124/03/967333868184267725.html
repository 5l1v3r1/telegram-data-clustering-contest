      <p>A viral video on Twitter features a group of hundreds of red worms moving together like a chunk of minced meat, but in a strange and terrifying way.</p>
      <p>The "clew" of worms, which some describe as a “marching army of worms”, was moving in one direction <a href="https://sputniknews.com/videoclub/201911231077383713-who-wins-in-brawl-for-survival-python-tries-to-constrict-leopard-in-kenya/">at extraordinary speeds</a>, for worms.</p>
      <p>Some claimed that the creatures in the video are actually millipedes, characterised as having two pairs of jointed legs for each body segment. Millipedes are scientifically <a href="https://sputniknews.com/videoclub/201911211077367277-giant-cobra-swallowed-massive-python/">classified as arthropods</a> and are also known as Diplopoda.</p>
