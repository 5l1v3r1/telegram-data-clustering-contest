      <p><b>NEW BRAINTREE, Mass.</b> - Authorities in New Braintree are investigating after two people were shot on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Police responded to reports of shots fired at a home on Worcester Road early in the morning.</p>
      <p>At the scene, officers found two women had been shot.</p>
      <p>"At the time they found one gunshot victim of a self-inflicted gunshot wound outside of the house," said Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early.</p>
      <p>Preliminary investigation found one woman seems to have pulled the trigger and shot herself outside the house, while the second woman was shot on the shoulder by someone else.</p>
      <p>Both women survived, but the woman who shot herself had to be taken to the hospital via med flight, while the other one was transported by ambulance.</p>
      <p>While neighbors are sparse in the area, police want the public to know that the incident was domestic and that there's no threat to the public. </p>
      <p>"We would just like everybody to know that there's no danger, this was an isolated incident, it's under investigation and the public should not worry," said DA Early.</p>
      <p>Both women are currently in stable condition at the hospital.</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made so far.</p>
      <p>The road remained closed throughout the day and well into the night as police continued to investigate the scene.</p>
