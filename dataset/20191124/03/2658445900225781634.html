      <p>MILITARY Assisted Democracies, as the acronym suggests, is a barmy oxymoron. Something just does not add up. How can the military, the grandmasters of violent seizure of the apparatuses of democratic governance, also be the great enablers of democracy? But then the real world itself can appear like one grand oxymoron. The world is so full of violent contradictions, of implausible somersaults, such that sometimes one is forced to think the unthinkable and believe the unbelievable.</p>
      <p>This normally happens when there is a global epistemological rupture, when the knowledge and belief systems under-girding and safeguarding our life has collapsed under the weight of new realities. The whole world is in a limbo. The old order is surely dead. But the new order is yet to be born, a victim of prolonged and protracted labour which evokes the horrors of a stillbirth.</p>
      <p>As a new round of struggle for greater political, economic, gender and spiritual equality takes root in many countries of the world, particularly in what has been hitherto regarded as relatively safe havens of inclusive governance, denizens of developing countries, especially the ethnically and culturally fractured countries of post-colonial Africa and Latin America, must be casting anxious glances at the ticking clock and wondering what the future has in store for them.</p>
      <p>For example, the good people of Nigeria, given the full scale electoral wars just enacted in Kogi and Bayelsa states, must be mortified at the prospects of their hard won civil rule transforming into a Mob Assisted Despotism in which armed civilian hordes and other organized militias are far more important in deciding the electoral destiny of the nation than actual voting and the collation of results.</p>
      <p>Yet as this column always cautions, all traditional societies, in the process of transition to political modernity, go through periods of stress and trauma. The harshness or severity of the convulsions depends on the countervailing political forces in such societies and the stage the political evolution has reached.</p>
      <p>It is therefore imperative for analysts, driven by patriotism rather than partisan consideration, to keep their eyes focused on the ball. For example, it may well be premature to conclude that what we are witnessing in Nigeria is an irreversible political decline; a regression of Military Assisted Democracy into the default setting of Stone Age despotism rather than being a temporary glitch in the system reflecting the cultural and political values of those in transient control of the state which cannot be sustained without the delicate architecture of the nation caving in.</p>
      <p>From time to time, the errant Nigerian political class, particularly its hegemonic master cadre, takes delight in testing how adept they are at political brinkmanship, driving the country to the edge of the abyss before suddenly pulling back. It should by now be obvious even to the politically deaf and obtuse that any thought of the Nigerian presidency remaining in the core north after 2023 is an open invitation to the forces of disintegration and dismemberment.</p>
      <p>In the not too distant future when all of this would have passed into history, it will be discovered that the two Buhari interregna are historically imperative to compel the nation to learn the right political lessons.</p>
      <p>First, the impossibility of expecting serving Third World generals to launch a revolution against the subsisting status quo and thirty five years later the futility of asking a conservative retired general with militant right wing notions of the nation to lead a sanitising crusade against his own class. These things cannot depend on lone, solitary individuals however messianic and deluded but on overriding critical masses.</p>
      <p>This is why political developments in Nigeria cannot be treated in isolation but in conjunction with developments elsewhere particularly in Latin America and the rest of Africa. It is now important to answer the opening poser since the military, however discredited and disreputable they have become in many of these countries,  still remain by far the most powerful and cohesive institution which can impose a semblance of order on nations on the verge of a complete breakdown of law and order.</p>
      <p>From the events that took place in Bolivia this past week, the rest of the world is asking the question: when is a coup and when does some form of military intervention become inevitable for societies on the verge of total collapse?  Having been bundled into a Mexico-bound plane after the Bolivian military delivered the coup de grace that ended his rule, it was clear last week that former president Evo Morales still did not understand what has hit him.</p>
      <p>In his first press conference in a foreign land having fled his own country,  an obviously disorientated Morales, the first indigenous ruler of Bolivia, was pleading that he should be allowed to go back home to complete the two months remaining of his old tenure. Having been formally deposed by the military and his successor legally enabled, this is never going to happen. It is like asking to step into the same river twice.</p>
      <p>It is a measure of Morales’ lack of intellectual sophistication and an indication of political obtuseness that he should even ask for this in the first instance. It is also an indication of how far he is removed from the political reality in his own nation.  Observers of the political turbulence that often characterize Latin American politics will be wondering whether the former trade unionist does not consider himself lucky to have survived the intrigues that led to his ouster in one piece.</p>
      <p>Had the Bolivian military High Command been racially motivated, the outcome would have been quite tragic. One only needs to contemplate the bloody putsch by General Augustino Pinochet against Salvador Allende in 1973 to gain a proper perspective.  After the military carpet bombed the Presidential Palace, Allende, famously glimpsed fondling a pistol, did not survive the fire fight. The ironic saving grace may well be because Morales’ Bolivia is a less racially and religiously homogenized society.</p>
      <p>For Evo Morales, matters need not have ended in this consuming tragedy for himself, his people and his beloved nation. A much valued member of the native Aymara ethnic group, Morales is credited with bringing inclusive development to the whole of Bolivia for the first time in its modern history. Before then, the native people were treated like dregs of the society and unwanted vagrants.</p>
      <p>In twelve brisk, bold years of purposeful governance Morales redirected the country’s enormous resources to the poor and neglected of Bolivia in a visionary reconstruction the like of which has never been seen in the history of the country. If after all this, Morales had signed off and respected the constitution of his country, he would have gone down as a hero of his people and the first transformational leader thrown up in their modern history.</p>
      <p>But by then the native Indian superstar had developed outsize appetite for power and an insatiable lust for office despite the outward appearance of modesty and Spartan self-denial. After forcing himself on the Bolivian electorate for an illegal third term through dubious constitutional chicanery, Morales resorted to further self-help in the actual election.</p>
      <p>As the election results flowed in and before the country’s electoral commission could pronounce, Morales declared himself the emphatic frontrunner even while dropping heavy hints that a coup might be underway. There followed an ominous twenty-four hour freeze on results after which Morales declared himself winner. A political thriller of the Magical Realism variety could not have been more compelling.</p>
      <p>The streets erupted in fire and thunder thereafter. The deposed president overestimated his own personal prestige and popular appeal among Bolivians while underestimating the resolve and capacity of many Bolivian nationals to defend their votes and the electoral integrity of the nation. A hurried audit of the election by an international group from the Organization of American States returned a damning verdict of widespread irregularities. Strangely enough, Morales acceded to the verdict but promised to conduct new elections.</p>
      <p>It was too little and too late. The protesters were taking none of that nonsense. The opposition leaders rightly insisted that Morales cannot profit from the electoral mess created by his own criminality. This was where the real danger facing Bolivia reared its ugly head as millions of Morales’ native supporters who believe that their hero was being unjustly persecuted by the hegemonic white settler class that had held them down for centuries joined battle with the anti-Morales protesters.</p>
      <p>The nation was in danger of sliding into chaos and civil war as casualties from street battles mounted. That danger remains even after the military high command stepped in to technically dismiss Morales from office following a widespread mutiny by the police whose officers joined the anti-Morales protesters. More violence broke out as a staunch opposition leader, Ms Anez, is named as Interim President.</p>
      <p>Whichever way one looks at this Bolivian conundrum and the dark shadows of foreboding that still hang over the country, one cannot but commend General Williams Kaliman and the Bolivian military high command for stepping in to save their nation from chaos and implosion. They have wisely refrained from pressing their luck and declaring a full blown military seizure of power.</p>
      <p>Words and their meaning often set traps and limits for expanded comprehension. This is one of those strange moments when a coup is not a coup in the classical sense of the term but a necessary and inevitable even if ironic ancillary to democratic development.</p>
      <p>The Bolivian military struck a blow for democracy and against constitutional infraction by a deluded and eerily deracinated autocrat. Military Assisted Democracy may be an oxymoron and a loony proposition in many countries, yet in a few it is alive and throbbing with intent and intensity.</p>
      <p>As for Evo Morales, his residual appeal and prestige in his country can still be leveraged to find a lasting solution to a bitterly divided and badly polarized nation, once he cures himself of the political hallucination of hoping to return soon to complete his tenure.</p>
      <p>The former president must wake to the reality that the tenure is gone perhaps forever even if his party, Movement to Socialism (MAS), remains the single largest political unit in Bolivia. Perhaps his spell in exile will allow him to reflect on the fact that the cool rigours of democratic evolution with its constitutionally delimited timeline must not be confused with the heady rituals of socialist revolution and its constitution-abolishing timelessness.</p>
