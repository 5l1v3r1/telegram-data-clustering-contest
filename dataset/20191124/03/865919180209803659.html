      <p>PHILADELPHIA — Jimmy Butler’s return to Philadelphia could be summed up in three letters: B-O-O.</p>
      <p>Josh Richardson scored 32 points and the 76ers led from start to finish in a 113-86 victory over Butler and the Miami Heat on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Butler struggled to 11 points, missing nine of 13 field goal attempts. He sat out the entire fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>The star guard couldn’t buy a basket — and the notoriously tough Philly fans relished every moment. They booed him loudly during introductions and every time he touched the ball in the first half.</p>
      <p>They also cheered whenever he missed, and that was quite often.</p>
      <p>“To tell you the truth, I legit didn’t even pay attention,” Butler said. “I really don’t pay attention to it.”</p>
      <p>Joel Embiid added 23 points and 11 rebounds for the 76ers (11-5), who won their fourth straight overall while improving to 7-0 at home.</p>
      <p>“They played incredibly well,” Butler said.</p>
      <p>Butler played 55 regular-season games for the Sixers last season, averaging 18.2 points after being acquired in a trade with Minnesota last November. He helped Philadelphia beat Miami in the first round of the playoffs before the 76ers were eliminated in the second round by Toronto.</p>
      <p>He left Philadelphia in the off-season, inking a four-year, $142 million deal with the Heat in a sign-and-trade that brought Richardson to Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>Butler shot 2 of 8 in the first quarter, the Heat failed to connect on 17 of 22 tries and Philadelphia was up 28-13. The pattern continued as the 76ers took a 55-35 halftime lead thanks to Miami’s 12-for-40 shooting in the first half, including 1 of 12 from behind the arc.</p>
      <p>Ben Simmons spent much of the night guarding Butler. When asked how he thought he fared, Philadelphia’s All-Star guard said, “I think it went well, if you look at the boxscore.”</p>
      <p>Philadelphia’s lead grew to 41 in the second half.</p>
      <p>Although Butler was embraced by the fan base during his stint in Philadelphia, everything wasn’t rosy.</p>
      <p>He got heated during a film session last season with 76ers coach Brett Brown about the way he was being used in Brown’s offence, and there seems to be some lingering hard feelings.</p>
      <p>Brown was terse in his comments about Butler prior to Saturday’s game.</p>
      <p>“He had some great games for us,” Brown said. “We came close at the end. Sometimes things don’t work out. He’s in a good place.”</p>
      <p>Brown said he hasn’t been in contact with Butler and answered a follow-up question about the Heat star by saying, “I look forward to talking about the Miami Heat.”</p>
      <p>Butler wasn’t much more forthcoming about the parting.</p>
      <p>“That’s something in the past,” he said. “I’ll leave it there.”</p>
      <p>Tyler Herro had 20 points to pace the Heat (11-4), who had won five in a row.</p>
      <p>RICHARDSON’S RETURN</p>
      <p>Richardson, who played his first four seasons in Miami and averaged 16.6 points last season, made 11 of 15 shots and went 6 of 7 on 3-pointers. He had missed the previous two games with a hip injury.</p>
      <p>“Definitely a fun game,” Richardson said. "I saw my first couple of shots go through and I just was staying aggressive."</p>
