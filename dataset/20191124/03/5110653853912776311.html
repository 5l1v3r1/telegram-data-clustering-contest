      <h1>Week 12 Fantasy Rankings: Kicker</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T03:40:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 03:40</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>Adam Vinatieri has made a lot of big kicks in his career, but by 2019's Week 12, I really hope he's nowhere near anyone's fantasy roster. There was a lot of muck for him to wade through to make it to the very bottom of our Week 12 fantasy kicker rankings, but he made it. It didn't even happen after his absolutely shanked game-winningattempt a few weeks ago, but if our rankings are any indication, Vinatieri has finally hit rock bottom.</p>
      <p>It's kind of a sad thing to think about -- will Justin Tucker ever bottom out the way Vinatieri has? Probably not, but time can be cruel. (Sorry for getting philosophical there.) This week's kicker rankings are pretty straightforward. You do have to worry about Harrison Butker and Michael Badgley on bye, but outside of Tucker and Greg Zuerlein, you can just replace them and not miss out on much.</p>

      </p>
      <p>I've also got to shout out Younghoe Koo. In his first game with the Falcons, in Week 10, he made all six of his kicking attempts -- four field goals and two extra points. He was a stud in the short-lived Alliance of American Football and has a strong enough kicking pedigree to expect solid performance for Atlanta the rest of the way. Koo is probably where I'd look first if I owned Butker or Badgley.</p>

      <p>And in the most exciting kicker news of the week, Tucker and Zuerlein face off with each other in a battle for kicker superiority. I say we just have a kicking game of H.O.R.S.E. to decide who wins that game.</p>
