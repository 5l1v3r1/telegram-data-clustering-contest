      <p>Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Saturday that there have been about 150,000 orders thus far for the electric carmaker’s Cybertruck, which was unveiled late on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“146k Cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri &amp; 17% single motor”, Musk said in a tweet, adding separately that the orders were achieved without any advertising or paid endorsements.</p>
      <p>The launch of the Cybertruck pickup suffered a setback when its “armored glass” windows shattered in a much-anticipated unveiling. The overall look of the electric vehicle had worried Wall Street on Friday.</p>
      <p>At the launch, Musk had taken aim at the design, power and durability of mainstream trucks, only to be shaken when the windows of Tesla’s new vehicle shattered while being tested.</p>
      <p>The blunder overshadowed the launch, which was live-streamed from Los Angeles and made #cybertruck a trending word on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Some Wall Street analysts praised the launch, but others doubted the futuristic design’s mass appeal.</p>
      <p>With a starting price of $39,900, the Cybertruck’s angular body in gun-metal gray resembles an armored vehicle. Its website shows that an immediate payment of $100 is required to reserve an order for the Cybertruck.</p>
      <p>Tesla plans to start manufacturing the truck around late 2021.</p>
      <p>The U.S. pickup truck market is one of the world’s most profitable vehicle segments and is dominated by Ford Motor Co , General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) .</p>
