      <h1>Week 12 NFL DFS Picks: Best value players, sleepers for FanDuel, DraftKings daily fantasy football lineups</h1>

      <p>Last week was unpredictable in daily fantasy football contests, to say the least. On DraftKings, John Brown was the highest-scoring player (37.7 points), and he was followed by four quarterbacks: Jimmy Garoppolo (34.66), Dak Prescott (34.56), Josh Allen (33.84), and Lamar Jackson (33.48). Three others (DJ Chark, Christian McCaffrey and Calvin Ridley) eclipsed the 30-point threshold. Overall, eight of the top 14 scorers were quarterbacks, which led to some tight scores towardthe top of most large-field tournaments across the NFL DFS industry. It just shows how important nailing the right sleepers and value picks are in both DraftKings and FanDuel contests.</p>

      <h3>NFL DFS Picks Week 12: QB sleepers, values</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Baker Mayfield, Browns vs. Dolphins (DraftKings $5,900 | FanDuel $7,500)</b>
      </p>
      <p>As seen last week when Josh Allen carved them up in Miami, this Dolphins defense is still really bad. While Mayfield has struggled this season, he will face a defense that’s allowed 246passing yards per game (20th) and 2.3 passing touchdowns per game (29th) with Odell Beckham Jr., Jarvis Landry, Kareem Hunt, and Nick Chubb all at his disposal in the passing game. If you believe in Mayfield, this is his get-right spot.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ryan Tannehill, Jaguars at Titans (DraftKings $5,300 | FanDuel $7,100)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Jaguars are 4-6 andon the outside looking in regarding the AFC playoff picture. After allowing 33 points to the Colts last week, they will take on a rested Ryan Tannehill and a Titans offense that is coming off of a bye. In his past two games, Tannehill rushed for 38 and then 37 yards, respectively, and is one of the better low-priced options on the slate, especially if he continues boosting his floor with his legs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Carson Wentz, Eagles vs. Seahawks (DraftKings $5,600 | FanDuel $7,300)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Seahawks defense has allowed 271.8 passing yards per game. On the year, Wentz has amassed 16 touchdowns and just four interceptions, but has taken nine sacks over his past two outings. Seattle’s defense ranks 29th in the NFL in sacks (2.0 per game), and if Wentz benefits from a clean pocket and added time to let his receivers gain separation, he could presumably do some work.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Week 12 DraftKings, FanDuel Picks: RB sleepers, values</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Bo Scarbrough, Lions at Redskins (DraftKings $4,200 | FanDuel $6,400)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Alabama standout was promoted from the practice squad a day before Detroit’s Week 11 game against the Cowboys and was immediately handed 14 carries for 55 yards and a touchdown. While rostering any Lions running back is a risky proposition, Scarbrough will face a Redskins team that has surrendered 133.9 rushing yards per game (28th). He should be given the opportunity to build off of last week’s performance.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Derrius Guice, Redskins at Lions (DraftKings $4,700 | FanDuel $5,400)</b>
      </p>
      <p>On the other side of that game, Guice should begin to receive an increased workload in the coming weeks. In last week’s blowout loss to the Jets, Adrian Peterson saw nine carries for 25 yards while Guice received seven carries for 24 yards. But, the rookie showed off his athleticism with a 45-yard touchdown reception. Since Dwayne Haskins has struggled mightily since taking over as the team’s starting quarterback and Washington’s offensive line has also struggled, expect the Redskins to try to get Guice the ball in space. At a low price across the industry, now might be the time to jump on him ahead of the field.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aaron Jones, Packers at 49ers (DraftKings $7,000 | FanDuel $7,600)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jones has been a touchdown machine this season. His 11 rushing scores are tied with McCaffrey and Dalvin Cook for the NFL lead, and he’s added three receiving touchdowns, as well. While the Packers have limited his touches in order to keep him fresh, expect them to lean on him in a tough matchup against the 49ers. He’ll be extra rested after a bye, and he’s already proven to be a slate-breaker twice this season.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>FanDuel, DraftKings Picks Week 12: WR sleepers, values</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Jamison Crowder, Jets vs. Raiders (DraftKings $6,200 | FanDuel $6,500)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Here are Crowder’s numbers over the last three weeks: 8-83-1, 6-81-1, 8-76-1. Despite that and the fact that he’ll be squaring off against a vulnerable Raiders pass defense that’s allowed 262.2 yards per game (27th), he isn’t priced up across the industry. He’s a solid mid-range target, and while he might not have the ceiling to win you a tournament, he’s performing on a consistent basis and is firmly in consideration for cash games.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Calvin Ridley, Falcons vs. Buccaneers (DraftKings $6,500 | FanDuel $6,700)</b>
      </p>
      <p>In case you missed it, the Buccaneers defense is the league’s most obvious pass funnel. Week after week, Todd Bowles’ crew has been dominant against the runbut horrendous against the pass. Although he will be chalky after he finally blew up against the Panthers last week (8-143-1), Ridley is much cheaper than teammate Julio Jones and should be one of Matt Ryan’s top targetseven if Austin Hooper (knee) and Devonta Freeman (foot) return.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Deebo Samuel, 49ers vs. Packers (DraftKings $5,100 | FanDuel $5,600)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking of chalky, Samuel will be a popular target this week, but he’s worth the click. Since being inserted into a prominent role within San Francisco’s offense, he’s posted back-to-back 100-plus-yard games (8-134-0 and 8-112-0). Since the Packers are coming off a bye and will be rested, expect Green Bay to put up points in this matchup, which could force the Niners to throw more than they are accustomed to. If George Kittle (knee) and Emmanuel Sanders (ribs) both miss this game or are hobbled, expect Samuel to be one of Jimmy G’s top targets yet again.</p>

      <h3>Week 12 NFL DFS Picks: TE sleepers, values</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Dallas Goedert, Eagles vs. Seahawks (DraftKings $3,700 | FanDuel $5,200)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Is Goedert becoming more valuable than teammate Zach Ertz? That’s debatable. It’s been Goedert that has three touchdown catches in his past four games. Since the Seahawks have struggled against the pass this year, Goedert is a potentially low-owned stack candidate alongside Wentz in Week 12.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jimmy Graham, Packers vs. 49ers (DraftKings $3,600 | FanDuel $5,800)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Is Graham ever going to return to his former All-Pro form? Probably not. However, he has shown glimpses of his glory days in recent weeks. Last game, Aaron Rodgers connected with him for a 48-yard pass play. He also had a 29-yard reception and a touchdown a few weeks ago. If you’re looking for a low-owned GPP flier, you can do a lot worse than rostering him, especially if you don’t want to pay up at the position.</p>

      <h3>Week 12 NFL DFS values: D/ST sleepers</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Atlanta D/ST, Falcons vs. Buccaneers (DraftKings $3,500 | FanDuel $4,300)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Atlanta’s defense has held opponents to under 10 points in back-to-back weeks for the first time in 10 years, and Jameis Winston has been intercepted 18 times and lost four of his 11 fumbles in 10 games played. Enough said.</p>
