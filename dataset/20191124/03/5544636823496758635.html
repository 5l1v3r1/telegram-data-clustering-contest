      <p>Rave of the moment, Burna Boy’s year keeps getting better as the Nigerian superstar grabbed yet another trophy Saturday night following his Grammy nomination earlier in the week.</p>
      <p>The African Giant was crowned the African Artiste of the year at the 6th AFRIMA staged at Eko Hotel and Suites in Lagos.</p>
      <p>He also won Best Male artiste in West Africa.</p>
      <p>The annual event was attended by Nigeria’s Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed.</p>
      <p>Almost like the Headies Awards a few weeks back, many of the Nigerian artistes who won awards, including Burna Boy were absent.</p>
      <p>Most of them were represented by their managers, but award winners from other regions in Africa turned up for the show.</p>
      <p>Wizkid won song of the year in Africa, with his song ‘Fever’, while Tiwa Savage won Best Female Artiste in Western Africa. The award was collected by her manager.</p>
