      <p>The Union government is set to approve a new Indian Institute of Management (IIM) for Telangana, five years after the state was carved out of Andhra Pradesh.</p>
      <p>The HRD Ministry is learnt to have prepared a proposal this week, and a Cabinet note will be prepared once the plan gets the minister’s stamp of approval. In all likelihood, the institute will be located in Hyderabad.</p>
      <p>The proposal was fast-tracked after the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) wrote to the ministry last week, asking it to take a decision on the several requests received from the state, including one from the Chief Minister. The ministry was given a week to decide.</p>
      <p>The Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act promises an IIT, NIT, IIM, IISER, central university, petroleum university, agricultural university and IIIT for Andhra Pradesh, and a tribal university and horticulture university for Telangana. An IIM is not committed for Telangana. However, that is set to change.</p>
      <p>Since 2014, the NDA government has established seven new IIMs — in Maharashtra, Punjab, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and J&amp;K.</p>
