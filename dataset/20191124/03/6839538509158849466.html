      <p>An uncontrolled blaze is threatening a remote beachside community in the state’s North.</p>
      <p>An investigation is underway to determine the cause of a 250ha fire placing the small coastal community of Lulworth at risk.</p>
      <p>Sixty crews were tackling the blaze on Sunday afternoon, including five aircraft.</p>
      <p>TFS regional chief North Ian Bounds said.</p>
      <p>“Investigations will continue through Monday, but at this stage it’s not believed to have started by natural causes,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Bounds said the fire, now at Watch and Act level, was proving difficult for crews to control.</p>
      <p>He said people should stay away from the Lulworth area while crews worked to contain the blaze.</p>

      <p>EARLIER: AN uncontrolled fire raging in the state’s North is placing the small coastal community of Lulworth at risk.</p>
      <p>At 8pm, Tasmania Fire Service warned that the Maitland Bay vegetation fire would put Lulworth and nearby Tam O’Shanter Bay at high risk.</p>
      <p>Residents are reminded that embers, smoke and ash falling on the town and bay could threaten houses earlier than the main fire.</p>
      <p>The TFS advise that if your home is well prepared and actively defended, it could provide shelter. But if your family has a bushfire survival plan, to use it now.</p>
      <p>There is no evacuation centre near the fire at the moment.</p>
