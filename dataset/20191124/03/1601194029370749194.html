      <p>As per a report by <a href="https://wrestlingnews.co/wwe-news/vince-mcmahon-has-his-eye-on-at-least-two-wwe-nxt-stars">Paul Davis of WrestlingNewsCo</a>, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE </a>Chairman <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/vince-mcmahon">Vince McMahon</a> is high on two NXT Superstars. One of these wrestlers is NXT heavyweight Keith Lee, while the other is former UFC fighter Matt Riddle. Vince McMahon reportedly compared Riddle to WWE Hall of Famer Shawn Michaels.</p>
      <p>As per a source, Vince McMahon thinks that Keith Lee could be used as a powerhouse heel when he makes his way to one of the main roster shows. As for Riddle, Vince McMahon recently compared him with WWE legend Shawn Michaels.</p>
      <blockquote>"Vince likes guys like Shawn who have that rebel mentality and he sees some of Shawn in Matt. Matt can rub some people the wrong way but he’s a good guy and he will do great when Vince calls him up. I think he’s a future world champion. Vince will try to tweak him but his personality will get him far."</blockquote>
      <p>After a short stint in Pro Wrestling Guerilla, Keith Lee made his way to WWE NXT and defeated Kassius Ohno during WrestleMania weekend last year. Earlier this year, Lee suffered an injury that resulted in his feud with Dominik Dijakovic being cancelled. Recently, Lee was seen invading SmackDown Live alongside several other NXT Superstars.</p>
      <p>Matt Riddle was an MMA fighter who later made a name for himself on the independent scene, and bagged a WWE contract in 2018. Riddle is known for being outspoken while addressing his opponents on social media. The King of Bros feuded with WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg on Twitter after the latter's return earlier this year.</p>
