      <h1>Little goes right for Heat in blowout loss to 76ers in Jimmy Butler’s return to Philadelphia</h1>

      <p><b>PHILADELPHIA (AP) —</b> <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/josh-richardson-player-stats">Josh Richardson</a> scored 32 points and the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/philadelphia-76ers-team">Philadelphia 76ers</a> led from start to finish in a 113-86 victory over <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/jimmy-butler-player-stats">Jimmy Butler</a> and the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/miami-heat-team">Miami Heat</a> on Saturday night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/joel-embiid-player-stats">Joel Embiid</a> added 23 points and 11 rebounds for the 76ers (11-5), who won their fourth straight overall while improving to 7-0 at home.</p>
      <p>Butler struggled to 11 points, missing nine of 13 field goal attempts in his return to Philadelphia. He sat out the entire fourth quarter.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/tyler-herro-player-stats">Tyler Herro</a> had 20 points to pace the Heat (11-4), who had won five in a row.</p>
      <p>Butler played 55 regular-season games for the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nba/philadelphia-76ers-team">Sixers</a> last season, averaging 18.2 points after being acquired in a trade with Minnesota last November. He helped Philadelphia beat Miami in the first round of the playoffs before the 76ers were eliminated in the second round by Toronto.</p>
      <p>He left Philadelphia in the offseason, inking a four-year, $142 million deal with the Heat in a sign-and-trade that brought Richardson to Philadelphia. Richardson, who played his first four seasons in Miami and averaged 16.6 points last season, made 11 of 15 shots and went 6 of 7 on 3-pointers. He missed the previous two games with a hip injury.</p>
      <p>Butler couldn’t buy a basket — and the notoriously tough Philly fans relished every moment. They booed him loudly during introductions and every time he touched the ball in the first half.</p>
      <p>They also cheered whenever he missed — and that was quite often.</p>
      <p>Butler shot 2 of 8 in the first quarter, the Heat failed to connect on 17 of 22 tries and Philadelphia was up 28-13. The pattern continued as the 76ers took a 55-35 halftime lead thanks to Miami’s 12-for-40 shooting in the first half, including 1 for 12 from behind the arc.</p>
      <p>Philadelphia’s lead grew to 41 in the second half.</p>
      <p>Although Butler was embraced by the fan base during his stint in Philadelphia, everything wasn’t rosy.</p>
      <p>He got heated during a film session last season with 76ers coach Brett Brown about the way he was being used in Brown’s offense, and there seems to be some lingering hard feelings.</p>
      <p>Brown was terse in his comments about Butler prior to Saturday’s game.</p>
      <p>“He had some great games for us,” Brown said. “We came close at the end. Sometimes things don’t work out. He’s in a good place.”</p>
      <p>Brown said he hasn’t been in contact with Butler and answered a follow-up question about the Heat star by saying, “I look forward to talking about the Miami Heat.”</p>
      <p>Butler has adjusted with Miami quite well, averaging 19.5 points, 5.6 rebounds and seven assists entering Saturday.</p>
      <p>Heat coach Erik Spoelstra spoke highly of Butler before the game.</p>
      <p>“I like it,” he said about coaching Butler. “We speak the same language.”</p>
