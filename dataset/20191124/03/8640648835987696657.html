      <p>Lincoln County made a late push with two touchdowns in the final seven minutes, but it wasn’t enough in a 33-22 loss to Yerington in the Class 2A state football championship game Saturday at Carson City High School.</p>
      <p>The Lynx (9-3) had an 8-7 lead in the first quarter after Mason Thornock returned a kickoff 85 yards for a touchdown and Dean Ottley added a 2-point run.</p>
      <p>But the Lions (11-1) scored the next 27 points for a 33-8 lead. Donavan Coplin ran for two scores and ran for another for Yerington.</p>
      <p>Lincoln County’s fourth-quarter scores came on a 15-yard Thornock run and a 15-yard pass from Cody Zile to Kobe Kelley.</p>
      <h3>Class 3A</h3>
      <p><b>Fernley 24, Churchill County 20 — </b>Brandon Reyes scored two touchdowns rushing, and the Vaqueros won the Class 3A state championship at Carson City High School.</p>
      <p>It’s the first title for Fernley (11-2) since 1964 and fourth in school history. It came at the expense of the defending champion Greenwave (10-2), who got two touchdown passes from Elijah Jackson. Tommy McCormick caught one of them and also had an 80-yard kickoff return for a score.</p>
