      <h1>Yahoo Fantasy Football Picks Week 12: NFL DFS lineup advice for cash games</h1>

      <p>We had touchdowns and big yards all over the place in last week's<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/yahoo-fantasy-football-picks-week-10-nfl-dfs-lineup-advice-for-cash-games/f7d2musonof714q5j6y97x4nd">Yahoo DFS cash lineup</a>-- except for one big (almost) goose egg from Tyler Boyd. Lesson learned -- never trust a receiver who has Ryan Finley throwing to him. Fortunately, Drew Brees, Christian McCaffrey, Ezekiel Elliott, DJ Chark, Jamison Crowder, Ross Dwelley, Kalen Ballage, and the Jets D/ST all came through in one way or another. We'll try to keep the touchdowns rolling with ourWeek 12daily fantasy football cash lineup picks.</p>
      <p>With tight pricing -- particularly at TE -- we have to make some sacrifices. That mainly comes at RB, where we're not paying up for Christian McCaffrey or Saquon Barkley. We also just missed being able to afford Julio Jones, but getting solid values at WR2 and WR3 makes us feel a little better.</p>

      <p>The real question is whether to pay up for one of the few upper-tier TEs. In a GPP, we'd roll the dice on a lower-priced guy, but in cash, we're going with Darren Waller despite a tougher matchup. Let's hope that "advantage" gets us over the cash line.</p>
      <h3>Week 12 Yahoo NFL DFS Lineup: Picks, Advice for cash games</h3>
      <p><b>QB: Matt Ryan, Falcons vs. Buccaneers ($33). </b>Ryan got back on track last week with his seventh 300-yard game of the year, but with only one touchdown, it wound up being another mediocre performance. He hasn't had a "big game" since Week 6, so hopefully DFS owners are a little down on him. At home against Tampa, who allows the second-most fantasy points per game (FPPG) to QBs, Ryan should combine the yards and TDs and more than pay off his QB4 pricing.</p>

GPP</a></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>RB: Nick Chubb, Browns vs. Dolphins ($31). </b>We said we'd never make a cash lineup without Christian McCaffrey again, but his $40 price tag mixed with the lack of viable options at other positions (particularly TE, more on that later), make him tough to fit in. We're fine dropping down to Chubb, though, as Miami still ranks in the top six in FPPG allowed to RBs. The activation of Kareem Hunt hasn't really eaten into Chubb's touches, as he's had at least 47 carries in the past games (and at least 20 in seven of the past eight games). He won't do much through the air, which hurts a bit in half-point PPR contests, but he's a safe bet for 100 yards and some positive touchdown regression.</p>

        <b>WEEK 12 PPR RANKINGS: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-12-fantasy-ppr-rb-rankings-running-back-sleepers/1x0x7s3rojv001j4w68nm8zos7">Running back</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-12-ppr-rankings-wr-fantasy-football-wide-receiver-sleepers/1o9fjg2z6mzra1nyyh9xc82iar">Wide receiver</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-12-fantasy-ppr-rankings-tight-end-sleepers-te/1w752s5mgwmem1ie8oz1iw01e9">Tight end</a></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>RB: David Montgomery, Bears vs. Giants ($18). </b>Montgomery has disappointed two weeks in a row, but he's still getting consistent touches (15 last game). The Giants give up just a shade under 20 FPPG to running backs --and it's clear the Bears need to rely on their running game -- so Montgomery looks like a value at RB16 pricing.</p>
      <p><b>WR: Chris Godwin, Buccaneers @ Falcons ($32). </b>Godwin managed a late touchdown last week, but he tied a season low with three catches. That will rise in a big way against the Falcons, who allow the eighth-most FPPG to WRs. Godwin has only one TD in his past five games after scoring six in his first five contests, so we expect more TDs to come. We were a couple bucks away from being able to afford Julio Jones ($35), who we would have preferred, but Godwin is a nice consolation prize. At the very least, we like him better at his price than teammate Mike Evans at $35.</p>
      <p><b>WR: DeVante Parker, Dolphins @ Browns ($16). </b>Parker keeps producing as Miami's top wideout, yet he keeps getting priced like a middling real-life WR2. That's fine. We'll take the discount on a guy who pretty much has a floor of five catches and 55 yards every week with the upside from much more. Last week he put up a 7-135 line in a tough matchup against the Bills, so we're not worried about him against a decent Browns pass defense...at least not at $16.</p>
      <p><b>WR: Jamison Crowder, Jets vs. Raiders ($18). </b>Crowder is also underpriced given his matchup and recent production. He's scored in three straight games, posting at least five catches and 76 yards in each game during that span. We are a little worried about touchdown regression, but the Raiders are allowing the seventh-most FPPG to WRs, so we're not<i>that </i>worried.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>TE: Darren Waller, Raiders @ Jets ($21). </b>Tight end pricing is really tight, as Travis Kelce and Hunter Henry are on bye and Mark Andrews and Gerald Everett play on Monday night. Throw in injuries to Austin Hooper (knee), Evan Engram (foot) and George Kittle (knee), and there isn't much left in the upper tier. Kittle might play, but at $26, his price is even tougher to stomach than Waller, who's really the only other "high-floor" TE available (unless you count Zach Ertz at $22). We like Jacob Hollister, but he's just $3 cheaper than Waller, so that doesn't seem worth it. If we paid down, we'd go with Ryan Griffin at $14 given his recent performance and plus matchup.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>FLEX: Le'Veon Bell, Jets vs. Raiders ($20). </b>Bell has been a disappointment, but he keeps getting volume despite various injuries (at least 20 touches in each of the past three games). He's also scored in each of the past two games and averaged at least 93.7 total yards over that three-game span. The Raiders have gradually been going downhill against RBs, punctuated by allowing Joe Mixon's first rushing touchdown all season last week. Bell is a solid, high-floor play at $20.</p>
      <p><b>D/ST: Redskins vs. Lions ($10).</b>We don't feel great about this pick, but facing Jeff Driskel at home at the minimum price isn't a bad spot for a D/ST. We'll roll the dice and hope for some takeaways.</p>
