      <p>This time, the Regina Pats left no doubt.</p>
      <p>The WHL club enjoyed a long-awaited breakthrough on Friday night, pummeling the Swift Current Broncos 6-0 before 2,036 fans at the Innovation Credit Union iPlex.</p>
      <p>The victory came just three days after Swift Current escaped the Brandt Centre in Regina with a 2-1 win despite being outshot 49-28. Broncos goaltender Isaac Poulter was the first star in that contest, but he didn’t fare as well in Friday’s rematch.</p>
      <p>With the win, the Pats (4-14-2-0) moved a step closer to climbing out of the WHL basement. They’re two points behind the Prince George Cougars (5-16-0-2) with three games in hand and three points back of the Broncos (5-13-1-2) with a game in hand.</p>
      <p>Robbie Holmes led the Pats’ offence with his first career hat trick and netminder Max Paddock stopped 25 shots for his first shutout of the season.</p>
      <p>The visitors finished with a season-high 55 shots on goal.</p>
      <p>Riley Krane opened the scoring midway through the first period before Holmes scored back-to-back goals 1:54 apart in the last five minutes of the frame.</p>
      <p>Nikita Sedov made it 4-0 just 2:17 into the second and Holmes completed his hat trick with 1:43 left on the clock. Zack Smith rounded out the scoring with 3:35 remaining in the third.</p>
      <p>It was also a breakout night for Regina’s struggling power-play unit, which finished 3-for-6. Swift Current went 0-for-6.</p>
      <p>Carson Denomie — acquired from Moose Jaw on Monday — picked up his first points as a member of the Pats with two assists. Tyson Feist, Drew Englot and Zach Wytinck also had two helpers apiece.</p>
      <p>It was the first of seven straight road games for the Pats. They conclude a stretch of four games in five nights on Saturday versus the Brandon Wheat Kings.</p>
