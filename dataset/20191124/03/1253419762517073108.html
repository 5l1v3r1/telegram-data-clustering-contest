      <h1>Here are Half-Life: Black Mesa and The Outer Worlds with Ray Tracing Reshade Mod</h1>

      <p>YouTube’s ‘SliM420 GaMing’ has shared two videos, showing Half-Life: Black Mesa and The Outer Worlds with the Pascal Gilcher’s Ray Tracing Reshade Mod. As we’ve already reported, this Reshade Mod can improve a game’s Global Illumination and Ambient Occlusion effects.</p>
      <p>Pascal Gilcher’s Reshade is only using depth information available in screen space in order to provide its “path tracing” effects. Furthermore, the Reshade does not have enough information about the light direction, and this may lead to some “<i>inaccurate</i>” effects. Still, these are indeed ray tracing effects.</p>
      <p>Since I’ve finished The Outer Worlds, I can safely say that this RT version looks better than what I’ve played. Half-Life: Black Mesa also looks great with this mod. Unfortunately, though, SliM420 GaMing did not provide any before/after comparisons. Moreover, he did not include any framerate on-screen indicators.</p>
      <p>As a bonus, I’ve also included below a new Ray Tracing Reshade video for the first Crysis. In this video, Digital Dreams compared the vanilla version with the ray traced version. For the Ray/Path Tracing Reshade version, Digital Dreams also used a 4K Texture Pack. And as you can see, the results are incredible. With the exception of some scenes, this modded version of Crysis can still look great.</p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
