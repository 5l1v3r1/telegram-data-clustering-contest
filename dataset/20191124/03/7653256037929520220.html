The 50-share Nifty gained 19 points to 11,914.</p>
      <p>Here are the top stocks and sectors that created all the buzz during the week gone by. <br/><b><br/>Top gainers of the week</b></p>
      <p>As many as 22 stocks in the BSE500 index delivered over 10 per cent returns to investors during the week. They included Vodafone Idea (up 78 per cent), UCO Bank (43 per cent), Tejas Networks (38 per cent), Corporation Bank (27 per cent) and Zee Entertainment (24 per cent). Aditya Birla Capital, ITD Cementation, DishTV, IRB Infra, eClerx Services and Coffee Day Enterprises advanced between 15 and 25 per cent.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Top losers of the week</b>
      </p>
      <p>As many as eight stocks on the BSE500 plunged in double digits. Gayatri Projects lost 36 per cent, followed by Reliance Capital (23 per cent), Reliance Infra (22 per cent), Indiabulls Integrated Services (18 per cent) and Time Technoplast (15 per cent). Caplin Point, Reliance Power and Jain Irrigation were among other stocks that fell over 10 per cent.</p>
      <p>
        <b>IPO update: CSB Bank sails on Day 1</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kerala-based CSB Bank’s IPO got fully subscribed on the first day of bidding on Friday. The initial public offering (IPO) received bids for 1,20,87,450 shares against the total issue size of 1,15,54,987 shares, reflecting 1.05 times subscription, according to data available with the National Stock Exchange. The quota reserved for non-institutional investors was subscribed 10 per cent, while that for retail investors was subscribed 5.60 times.</p>
      <p>In another development from the IPO-mart, realty firm Puranik Builders has filed fresh papers with markets regulator Sebi to raise an estimated Rs 1,000 crore through its initial share-sale.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Telecom stocks ring louder</b>
      </p>
      <p>With a 7.85 per cent rally, the BSE Telecom index emerged the biggest gainer on the exchange. It was followed by Healthcare (up 3.06 per cent), Power (up 0.97 per cent), Metal (up 0.82 per cent) and Bankex (up 0.16 per cent). On the other hand, IT, Consumer Durables and Auto declined up to 2.50 per cent. Vinod Nair, Head of Research Geojit Financial Services, said: “Buoyancy in the telecom sector was largely due to likelihood of hike in tariff and deferment of spectrum dues is likely to improve cash flow of these companies in the near term. On the other hand, fresh concerns over stringent norms for US H1b visa dragged IT heavyweights.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Zee Entertainment climbs 24%</b>
      </p>
      <p>Share of Zee climbed 24 per cent to Rs 357.90 on November 22 from RS 287.50 on November 15. Several foreign funds, including the New York-based BlackRock, Singapore government-backed GIC, HSBC Global, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley Asia, Vanguard and Wellington Management, have picked up stakes in Zee Entertainment Enterprises as the promoters sold stock to repay loans. Zee also remained as top gainer in the Nifty pack for week ended September 22.</p>
      <p>Emkay Global Financial Services has ‘Hold’ rating on Zee with a target price of Rs 389. On the positive side, the brokerage house believes that the deal removes the pledge overhang while also ensuring the continuation of the current management team. However, on the other side it added that net cash in the balance sheet fell to Rs 1,480 crore in Q2FY20 from Rs 3,240 crore in Q4FY18.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Other Nifty’s top gainers/ losers</b>
      </p>
      <p>With a gain of nearly 9 per cent, Sun Pharma emerged second biggest gainer in the Nifty pack for the week. Bharti Airtel (up 7 per cent), Eicher Motors (up 6.82 per cent) and IndusInd Bank (up 6 per cent) were among other major gainers in the 50-share pack. On the other hand, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, YES Bank, Britannia Industries, TCS, Asian Paints and Hero MotoCorp declined between 4-6 per cent during the week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Scrips at fresh 52-week highs/lows</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the BSE500 index, Polycab India, Adani Green Energy, Persistent Systems, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management and HDFC Asset Management were among 40 firms that hit new 52-week highs. On the other hand, Time Technoplast, Sobha, Gayatri Projects, Blue Dart, Omaxe and Caplin Point hit new 52-week lows. <br/><b><br/>YES Bank slips</b></p>
      <p>Rana Kapoor sold remaining 0.8 per cent stake in YES Bank during the week, keeping a token 900 shares he once famously said were his “diamonds”. The scrip fell 5.68 per cent to Rs 64.80 during the week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>RIL nears Rs 10 lakh cr valuation</b>
      </p>
      <p>The market valuation of Reliance Industries, the country's most valued firm, is fast nearing the Rs 10 lakh crore mark helped by the continuous rise in its share price.
