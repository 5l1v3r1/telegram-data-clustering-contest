      <h1>DraftKings Picks Week 12: NFL DFS lineup advice for daily fantasy football cash games</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T03:36:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 03:36</time> by <a rel="author">Thomas Emerick</a></address>
      <p>Our Week 12 DraftKings cash lineup willcapitalize on some offenses that have become quietly competent, or at least ones that have flown under the radar enough to avoid aggressive price adjustments on NFL DFS sites.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/draftkings-picks-week-11-nfl-dfs-lineup-advice-cash-games-daily-fantasy-football-sleepers-values/12p7o6k2owi9p14fetepe3xkve">Last Sunday's main slate attack</a> focused on mid-tier receivers with target floor and receiving upside, which got us across the finish line thanks to John Brown and Calvin Ridley. We also ran with the pack on D.J.Moore and made out fine there.</p>
      <p>

      <h3>DraftKings Week 12 Picks: NFL DFS cash lineup</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Playing under a $50K salary cap for Sunday afternoon ET contests.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>UPDATE: QB Carson Wentz, Eagles vs. Seahawks ($5,600).</b> We'll capitalize on Wentz going dirt cheap after three straight games against top-10 defenses, including the top two units in New England and Buffalo. Wentz is primed to rebound at home against a bottom-10pass yards defense with the expected return of his top receiver in Alshon Jeffery.</p>
      <p>
        <i><b>INITIAL QB Sam Darnold, Jets vs. Raiders ($5,800). </b>The Raiders defense fared better recently against Philip Rivers and Ryan Finley. However, this unit still allows the sixth-most DK points to quarterbacks and visits Sam Darnold, who's coming off consecutive 20-plus-point weeks.</i>

GPP</a></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>UPDATED RB Saquon Barkley, Giants @ Bears ($7,900).</b> It appears Saquon is far healthier coming out of the Giants bye and gets a $900 price reduction after his dud against aJets run D that allows the league's lowest yards per attempt. The pass volume's locked in with five or more targets in each game this season.</p>
      <p>
        <i><b>INITIAL RB Alvin Kamara, Saints vs. Panthers ($8,200). </b>Kamara leads all running backs in receptions since coming off bye and injury leave two weeks ago. Pricing for 2018 Kamara would get him easily to $10K, Christian McCaffrey range, and I like his chance of getting to 4X value and 25 DK points more than CMC hitting 4X value this week.</i>

      <p>UPDATEDRB Chris Carson,</p>
      <p>
        <i><b>FIRST UPDATE RB Leonard Fournette, Jaguars @ Titans ($7,300).</b> Another post-dud discount as Fournette drops $600 following the Jags' pass-heavy rout against Indy. The Titans' No. 26 total offense is less likely to put the Jags in negative game script, and Fournette has shown resistance iwth at least seven targets in three straight games.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i><b>INITIAL RB Joe Mixon, Bengals vs. Steelers ($5,900). </b>Mixon hit 3X value for me last week and gets priced up a modest $400 on a trip home to face Cincinnati's big bro from Pittsburgh. This is still a slow adjustment from DraftKings given that Mixon ranks fourth in the league in touches since Zac Taylor put in his rookie QB.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>WR DJ Chark Jr., Jaguars @ Titans ($6,400). </b>Nick Foles clearly sees Chark the alpha WR. In Foles'first week back, Chark led the league in both targets and air yards, smashing with104 yards and two scores on eight catches. Even if Foles throws fewer times in Tennessee, Chark's piece of the pie makes mid-tier price work here.</p>
      <p><b>WR Jarvis Landry, Browns vs. Dolphins ($6,300). </b>There are some grossly underpriced receiversin offenses that have become competent. Only two players have seen more targets over the past four weeks than Landry, so we like him to pay off in this "revenge" spot.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>UPDATED WR Alshon Jeffery, Eagles vs. Seahawks ($4,900).</b> Practice reports indicate we should be good to go here post-injury. In games where Jeffery played through most of the snaps,he led the Eagles in <a href="http://airyards.com/tables.html">target market share</a>at 24%. Eagles O is going underpriced afterrecent tough matchups withoutJeffery,so I'll look tocapitalize.</p>
      <p>
        <i><b>INITIAL WR Michael Gallup, Cowboys @ Patriots ($5,900). </b>Gallup ranks fifth among receivers in targets since Week 9, knotting him with teammate Amari Cooper for a 23-percent target market share. Assuming Stephon Gilmore gets Amari Cooper and Jason McCourty gets Gallup, I prefer the (healthier) latter at lower cost.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>TE Ryan Griffin, Jets vs. Raiders ($4,200). </b>Griffin gets to build on his 25-DK-pointweek with a price that doesn't really factor his usage sans Chris Herndon, who is now on IR. When you remove the Week 10 outing where Chris Herndon factored more heavily, Griffin ranks fifth in TE targets since Week 8.</p>

Swapping Henry in against road dog Jacksonville saves a enough cap to get us a high-volume RB in the flex.</p>
