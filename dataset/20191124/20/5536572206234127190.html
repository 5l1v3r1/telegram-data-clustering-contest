      <p>Josh Norman has fallen out of grace in Washington.</p>
      <p>The Redskins cornerback was said to be a healthy scratch before the game, but instead, the team decided to demote him to special teams play.</p>
      <p>He clearly didn’t like the decision as he gave zero effort on a field goal as he watched and then walked off the field.</p>

      <p>Norman has one year left on his contract, and the team will likely cut him before next season in order to save $12.5 million against the cap.</p>
      <p>His tenure is definitely coming to a bitter end.</p>
