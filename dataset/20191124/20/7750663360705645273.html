      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino 'leading candidate to replace Unai Emery at Arsenal'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a> is reportedly a leading candidate to replace <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/unai-emery/"><b>Unai Emery</b></a> at <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/"><b>Arsenal</b></a>, should the North London club choose to sack him.</h2>

      <p>The Gunners needed a late equaliser from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alexandre-lacazette/"><b>Alexandre Lacazette</b></a> to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/arsenal-vs-southampton_game_92626.html">salvage a point</a> at home against Southampton, extending their current run to just two wins from their last 11 Premier League games.</p>
      <p>Emery is now thought to be under increased pressure and while Arsenal's head of football <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/raul-sanllehi/"><b>Raul Sanllehi</b></a> and technical director <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/edu/"><b>Edu</b></a> are thought to want to give the Spaniard more time, the <i>Daily Mail</i> reports that other board members are unconvinced and are considering his future.</p>
      <p>The report states that a three man shortlist of potential replacements has been drawn up, with Pochettino joined by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/massimiliano-allegri/"><b>Massimiliano Allegri</b></a> and former Arsenal midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mikel-arteta/"><b>Mikel Arteta</b></a>.</p>
      <p>However, Pochettino, who was sacked by North London rivals <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> on Tuesday after five years with the club, is a heavy favourite because of his knowledge of the league and the style of football he implemented at Spurs.</p>
      <p>It is believed, though, that Arsenal are reluctant to replace their manager mid-season and that were they to let Emery go, club legends <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/steve-bould/"><b>Steve Bould</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/fredrik-ljungberg/"><b>Fredrik Ljungberg</b></a> would take charge in the interim.</p>
