      <p>Bangladesh captain Mominul Haque accepted that his side failed the pink-ball challenge in their maiden day-night test against India but denied it was a mistake to take the plunge without adequate preparation.</p>
      <p>KOLKATA, India: Bangladesh captain Mominul Haque accepted that his side failed the pink-ball challenge in their maiden day-night test against India but denied it was a mistake to take the plunge without adequate preparation.</p>
      <p>A rampant India triumphed in a little over two days to complete a 2-0 series sweep in what was the first day-night test for both teams.</p>

      <p>Asked if it was a mistake to accept India's proposal for a pink-ball test, Mominul said: "I don't think it was a wrong decision.</p>
      <p>"We failed in this match but we had to play it at some point of time. It was a great learning experience. This was India's maiden pink-ball test too. So I don't think there was any problem with that decision."</p>
      <p>Bangladesh were bowled out for 106 in the first innings and 195 in the second with their batsmen struggling against the exaggerated swing of the heavily-lacquered ball.</p>
      <p>Several players took painful blows to their body and they needed two concussion substitutes after Liton Das and Nayeem Hasan sustained sickening blows to the helmet.</p>
      <p>Only Mushfiqur Rahim (74) and Mahmudullah, who retired hurt on 39 with a hamstring injury, offered some resistance with the bat.</p>
      <p>"As professional cricketers, there’s no room for excuses. Losers give excuses. I am not giving it," said Mominul who was out for a duck in both innings.</p>
      <p>"We didn’t play well team-wise. We didn’t even have one good partnership, barring the one between Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah... We batted very poorly."</p>
      <p>It was Mominul's first series as the test captain, having inherited the role after all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan was banned by the governing International Cricket Council for an anti-corruption breach.</p>
      <p>The tourists also missed experienced opener Tamim Iqbal who skipped the tour to be with his pregnant wife who delivered a baby girl last week.</p>
      <p>"We have been missing them since the start of the series. But we shouldn’t use it as an excuse," Mominul said.</p>
      <p>"Their absence offers opportunities for others. It was an opportunity for me as a captain. But we couldn’t grab those opportunities."</p>
