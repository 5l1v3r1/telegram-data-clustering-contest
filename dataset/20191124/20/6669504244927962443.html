      <p>MADRID - World No. 1 Rafael Nadal defeated Denis Shapovalov 6-3, 7-6 (7) on Sunday to give Spain its sixth Davis Cup title and deny Canada its first.</p>
      <p>Shapovalov of Richmond Hill, Ont., fended off a pair of championship points in the second-set tiebreak before Nadal could seal the win.</p>
      <p>The No. 15-ranked Shapovalov — Canada's top singles player — was playing a must-win match after Montreal's Felix Auger-Aliassime dropped the opening singles rubber in straight sets to Roberto Bautista Agut earlier Sunday.</p>
      <p>Nadal was untouchable this the week, going 8-0 while facing just three break points throughout the Davis Cup Finals — including one from Shapovalov in the second set. He improved to a staggering 29-1 in singles matches in his Davis Cup career.</p>
      <p>The Canadians team was competing in the final at a Davis Cup for the first time. Canada first appeared in the international team tournament in 1913.</p>
      <p>Spain, playing in its 10th final, earned its first title since 2011.</p>
