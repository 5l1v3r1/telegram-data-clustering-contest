      <p>This is one wild tale.</p>
      <p>An Argentine woman rescued a cuddly abandoned kitten — only to learn two months later that the new pet was actually a wild puma.</p>
      <p>Florencia Lobo said she and her brother found the furry feline along with another young kitten next to a dead adult in the Tucuman Province in northwestern Argentina and took them both home.</p>
      <p>“We thought that it was an abandoned cat who had given birth,” she told Reuters.</p>
      <p>One of the kittens was too weak and didn’t survive, but the second, a male, made it through the ordeal. Lobo nursed him back to health and named him Tito.</p>
      <p>Two months later she took Tito to the vet for a checkup and got an unexpected prognosis.</p>
      <p>“The vet didn’t know what it was but said it was not a normal cat,” Lobo said.</p>
      <p>At the vet’s recommendation, she took Tito to the Horco Molle nature reserve, where staffers confirmed that the cat was a jaguarundi, a small wild cat found in South American and southern North America.</p>
      <p>Tito now calls the nature reserve home.</p>
