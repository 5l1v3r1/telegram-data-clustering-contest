      <h2>O’Brien will follow older brother Joseph and father Aidan into training</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:27:54+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/brian-o-connor-7.1837479" target="_blank">Brian O'Connor</a></address>
      <p>Champion flat jockey Donnacha O’Brien has announced his retirement from race-riding and confirmed he will start training in 2020.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old son of champion trainer Aidan O’Brien has been leading rider in Ireland for the last two years, earning champion jockey status like his older brother Joseph.</p>
      <p>On Sunday night O’Brien confirmed he will join his brother in the training ranks next year.</p>
      <p>“After thinking about things for a while I have decided to concentrate on training next year. Riding has been very good to me and I owe everything to the people around me,” he said on Twitter.</p>

      <p>“I look forward to training a small group of horses next year and will hopefully build from there,” he added.</p>
      <p>O’Brien has reportedly been preparing horses at the Co Tipperary yard from which <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=David+Wachman">David Wachman</a> used to train up to some years ago.</p>
      <p>At nearly six feet in height, O’Brien has had to battle weight throughout his short but hugely successful riding career.</p>
      <p>He rode 10 Group One winners including this year’s English 2,000 Guineas on Magna Grecia. Last year he also won the Guineas on Saxon Warrior and the Oaks on Forever Together.</p>
      <p>Perhaps his most memorable success came in the 2018 Irish Derby when guiding his brother Joseph’s Latrobe to success, beating his father who had the second, third, fourth and fifth.</p>
      <p>The majority of O’Brien’s major winners have been for the Coolmore operation, although his first Group One was on Intricately in the 2016 Moyglare.</p>
