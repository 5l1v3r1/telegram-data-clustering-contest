      <h1>Free job training is available in NYC — and it can be a life-changer</h1>

      <p>When her husband died unexpectedly in 2011, Kieli McCoy found herself as a single mother with an insufficient paycheck to feed her four children, never mind pay rent or the rest of the family’s bills.</p>
      <p>She had a job, “but I was scheduled for barely 10 hours a week,” says the Brooklyn resident. And although she had experience working at Starbucks and taking 311 calls, those skills didn’t qualify her for jobs that would pay a livable wage. “I had to do something to support my family,” she says.</p>
      <p>At a cousin’s recommendation, McCoy contacted Nontraditional Employment for Women (New-NYC.org), a Chelsea-based organization that offers a free 7-week program aimed towards giving women a well-rounded introduction to the building trades, including hands-on experience with tools and building materials. The curriculum includes basic shop classes in carpentry, electrical work, painting and health-and-safety training.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t even know that a career in construction was available for someone like me,” says McCoy. But as she learned that construction jobs usually pay well, come with excellent health benefits, a pension and an annuity, she was eager to get started.</p>
      <p>“There was no hesitation,” she says — especially because women who successfully complete the program are paired with paid apprenticeships where opportunities for advancement are commonplace and raises can come often.</p>
      <p>“It was hard at first,” says McCoy, now 41. She not only had to learn “trades math,” but also physically lift and carry heavy objects (you have to be able to pick up 50 pounds before you can qualify for the program) and re-learn what it means to be on time. “Early is on time, on time is late,” she says.</p>
      <p>The hard work has paid off. McCoy is now a foreperson-in-training. “My life has changed drastically. I was in Section-8 housing and on public assistance. Now, I make six figures.”</p>
      <p>While her story might sound like a fairy tale, good careers and jobs that pay a livable wage are not out of reach for unemployed, underemployed or less educated, low-income New Yorkers — even those with criminal backgrounds. The city is full of free programs geared toward training those individuals to become skilled workers and then connecting them to paying jobs. Curriculums include commercial driving, construction, maintenance, culinary skills, film and television production- assistant training, health and office operations, low-voltage cabling, woodworking and more. Most programs ask participants for a two-year commitment to their new professions.</p>
      <p>The training isn’t only about hard skills. Many of these programs also teach soft skills, such as how to get along with others, handle conflict, overcome obstacles and so on. Strive International in Harlem (StriveNewYork.org) goes a step further with its four-week job readiness program which precedes job training.</p>
      <p>“We focus on the whole person,” says Lakythia Ferby, executive director, STRIVE New York. That includes learning to tell your life story and discovering things like “what is wonderful about you,” as well as confronting obstacles to success.</p>

      <p>Arthur Larsen, 23, says that the 7-week program at Brooklyn-based Brooklyn Woods (BWINY.org), which prepares graduates to become skilled, entry-level woodworkers and fabricators, has already had a big impact on his life. Not only does he have a full-time job, but he’s also letting go of his tough exterior.</p>
      <p>“Cassandra [Charles, program coordinator] told me that she doesn’t buy my rough demeanor — that if people give me a chance, they’ll find out I’m a nice guy. That helped me a lot,” he says.</p>
      <p>Larsen, who is on parole, adds that making cabinets at Brooklyn Woods Social Enterprise “makes me happy . . .  Now I can breathe.” Not only that, but he was just approved for supervised visitations with his child.</p>
      <p>Jorge Torres, a political asylum refugee from Venezuela, went through the same channel to find Brooklyn Workforce Initiative’s “Made in New York” production-assistant training program, which has led him to a job he is passionate about — working on sets where they make music videos, commercials and other productions.</p>
      <p>The curriculum consists of four weeks of classroom training and a one-week internship. While the program covers things like walkie-talkie etiquette and set jargon, it also offers “how-to’s” when it comes to resume-writing, marketing and networking.</p>
      <p>Emmanuel Simon, 27, of Brooklyn, decided that working in a car dealership storage lot, as well as bar-backing, would never lead to a decent paycheck or a career. So when he found out about Brooklyn Networks’ six-week, low-voltage technician training, he wanted in. But admission requires a little more effort than just signing up. “You really have to want it,” says KenTara John, director of Brooklyn Networks’ cable-training and employment program, and you must qualify.</p>
      <p>To be admitted, Simon first had to attend Brooklyn Networks’ information session to fill out an application and meet the staff. Next came the two-day pre-training session during which individuals are evaluated to see how serious they are, to ensure they can follow directions and to check their vision. Of the 30 individuals who attend pre-training, about half are invited to the program. “We want to make sure they are committed and can be successful,” says John. About 80 percent of those who graduate land jobs.</p>
      <p>Simon now wires internet, data and voice lines in unfinished buildings.</p>
      <p>When Queens resident Romelia Corvacho first went to Strive, she wanted them to show her how to get a job that wasn’t in a factory. She was 25 and had just become a US resident, having fled terrorism in Peru.</p>
      <p>“I kept going on job interviews, and no one hired me,” she says. “Strive’s job readiness was an eye-opener. I didn’t know American culture, how to interview, what to wear, how to behave.”</p>
      <p>Once she completed the program, she got an office job, learned to file taxes and more.</p>
      <p>“I am so thankful,” she says, noting that now, 19 years later, she works with a team of doctors and nurses in a community health program where she earns over six figures. Not only that, but she has since earned her college degree and become a US citizen.</p>
      <p>“I even have an American boyfriend,” she says.</p>
