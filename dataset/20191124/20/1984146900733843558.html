      <p>Now where were we before we were rudely interrupted?</p>
      <p>Ah yes, winning football matches. So can Aston Villa be put to the buck?</p>
      <p>The international break has had a significant impact on the two clubs - United needed it like a rash having won back to back games to gain real momentum at long last while Villa desperately required a fortnight’s break to get influential players like Jack Grealish and Tom Heaton fit having lost their last three excursions onto the field of battle.</p>
      <p>However caution is required when perusing current results because Villa without their skipper Grealish lost to Manchester City away 3-0, Liverpool home 2-1, and derby rivals Wolves away 2-1 which is hardly humiliation. Many other sides, including Newcastle, would have found those fixtures daunting especially with their best player missing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-vs-newcastle-united-17303802">This is a match balanced on a knife edge</a> which could go either way but from a Geordie point of view must fall on the right side of the divide. If it does then optimism will abound and if Steve Bruce and his hardy outriders feel they have been undervalued or unloved so far following the departure of a Treasured One then this is an ideal opportunity to banish the blues.</p>
      <p>Geordies love nought better than a large dollop of hope and pride.</p>
      <p>United’s head coach has had more clubs than Rory McIlroy. Fourteen in all, 15 jobs as player and manager having been to Wigan twice.</p>
      <p>This merry day he’s back at one of them where he spent two years and that only adds a little spice to a match already bubbling under.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sob-tyne-jack-grealish-unlikely-17289047">Villa fans don’t like their Geordie counterparts</a> and feel that Bruce failed to do the job he was paid to do which was fashion promotion so they would love a return to winning ways at the expense of both.</p>
      <p>Don’t give it them!</p>
      <p>Of course Newcastle are playing catch up going last on a Monday night and inevitably the landscape has changed. While Norwich gained an eye-catching away victory and Southampton secured a draw at Arsenal to tighten up the bottom of the table home defeats for Crystal Palace and Brighton mean United can leapfrog them with any sort of return at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>For both clubs it’s all about getting three crucial points to prevent glancing in the rear mirror before the two Manchester giants loom on the horizon - Man City here for Newcastle and Man U away for Villa.</p>
      <p>I’ll go back on my original question: can Villa be put to the buck? Yes they can. Now go out and do it. My bitten finger nails have just started growing again!</p>
