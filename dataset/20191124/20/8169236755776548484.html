      <h1>“He just gets it all wrong” – Souness slams Manchester United star’s performance vs Sheffield</h1>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/woeful-phil-jones-hauled-half-20951322?2">Mirror</a>, Liverpool legend Graeme Souness blasted Phil Jones’ poor performance for Manchester United in the first-half of today’s exciting clash against Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>The England international was brought off at halftime with the Red Devils trailing 1-0 at the time. Souness told Sky Sports’ panel while covering the game that the centre-back “gets it all wrong” and that he isn’t a “cute player”.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old was making his first appearance of the season in the Premier League and he struggled to cope with Sheffield’s attacking players.</p>

        <b>Here’s what Souness had to say about Jones’ performance:</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Jones has done everything wrong for the goal. Protect the ball. Try and get your team a goal kick or at worse put it out for a throw in.”</p>
      <p>“He just gets it all wrong. Jones isn’t a cute player – he hasn’t got a great touch, so he should just put it into row Z at worst.”</p>
      <p>Despite United’s massive investment into their defence with the signings of Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Harry Maguire this summer, it doesn’t look as though the team is confident at the back.</p>
      <p>Given Jones’ unflattering performance today, perhaps Ole Gunnar Solskjaer should look to promising youngster Axel Tuanzebe the next time he decides to make changes and add players to the defence.</p>
