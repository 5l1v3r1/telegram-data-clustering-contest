      <p>Amid hotel politics unfolding in Maharashtra, sources informed that NCP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar is mulling legal option. As per sources, he will be challenging his removal from the post of leader of the legislative party. Ajit Pawar has maintained that he is an NCP leader and that party's supremo Sharad Pawar is his chief while claiming that NCP and BJP will form a stable government in the state. However, Sharad Pawar clarified that  there is no alliance with the BJP.</p>

      <p>Maharashtra's political scenario remains complicated with BJP confident of proving its number and NCP's Ajit Pawar assuring a stable government under NCP and BJP alliance. On the other side, NCP supremo clarified that his claims are 'false and misleading'. While Congress is claiming the developments in Maharashtra as a blot in democracy and is demanding the resignation of the governor, Shiv Sena whose chief Uddhav Thackeray was on the verge of the CM has moved to the Supreme Court claiming Devendra Fadnavis' oath-taking as ''unconstitutional'.</p>

      <h3>Political scenario</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, hotel politics began in the state with Shiv Sena and Congress MLAs being holed up in Hotel JW Marriott, while NCP MLAs being holed up in Rennaisance Hotel in Powai. Earlier in the day, Ajit Pawar thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister and BJP president Amit Shah, and other BJP leaders and ensured that there will be a stable government. He also changed his Twitter bio to Deputy CM of Maharashtra, while also maintaining that he is an NCP leader. However, on Saturday, he skipped the party's legislative meet even as sources told that he was summoned by the NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and was told to resign from the deputy CM's post. </p>
