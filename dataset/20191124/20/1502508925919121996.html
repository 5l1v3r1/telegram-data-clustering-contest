      <h1>France's LVMH close to buying Tiffany after sweetening offer, says report</h1>
      <h2>Bulgari owner LVMH is nearing a deal to acquire Tiffany for $135 per share, the report said</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:45:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:45</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>French luxury group <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/lvmh">LVMH </a>is nearing a deal to buy U.S. jewelry chain Tiffany &amp; Co for about $16.3 billion, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Bulgari owner <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/lvmh">LVMH </a>is nearing a deal to acquire Tiffany for $135 per share, the sources said, adding that a deal could be announced either on Sunday or Monday.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported this week that <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/lvmh">LVMH </a>had persuaded Tiffany to provide it with confidential due diligence after it raised its bid to close to $16 billion.</p>
      <p>Tiffany earlier this month rebuffed LVMH's initial $120-per-share all-cash offer, arguing it significantly undervalued the company.</p>
      <p>Tiffany, founded in New York in 1837 and featured in the 1961 movie "Breakfast at Tiffany's" starring Audrey Hepburn, had struggled with falling annual sales and profit since 2015, before a revenue turnaround in 2017.</p>
      <p>Jewelry was one of the strongest performing areas of the luxury industry in 2018, according to consultancy Bain &amp; Co, which forecast that comparable sales in the $20 billion global market were set to grow 7% this year.</p>
      <p>Under Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo, former head of fashion firm Diesel and a Bulgari alumnus, Tiffany has been building up its e-commerce business and is trying to court younger shoppers with more affordable pendants, earrings and new designs.</p>
      <p>The news was first reported by the Financial Times. Both <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
