      <p><b>DOUGLASSVILLE, Pa. (AP)</b> - State police are investigating after they found three people dead following a garage fire at an eastern Pennsylvania home.</p>
      <p>Police in Berks County say the bodies were found after crews were dispatched to the Union Township address shortly before 5:30 p.m. Saturday.</p>
      <p>Trooper David C. Beohm on Sunday identified two of the deceased as 60-year-old Ira Reed Jr. and 63-year-old Joanne Deluca. He said the third person will not be identified until the conclusion of the investigation.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate word on a possible cause of death. Beohm earlier said it was still an "active crime scene."</p>
      <p>Neighbors said a family of three - a couple and an adult son - moved to the property several years ago after losing their southern New Jersey home in Superstorm Sandy.</p>
