      <h1>The Betting Line For Nebraska-Iowa Is Set</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:46:51+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Iowa and Nebraska face off next Friday with both teams eyeing very different goals. The Hawkeyes will be hoping for a place in a major bowl game, while the Huskers will be fortunate to play any bowl game.</p>
      <p>Both teams are coming off huge wins, but the visiting Hawkeyes have been the better program all year. The bettors seem to think Iowa has the edge too.</p>
      <p>According to CircaSports, the Hawkeyes will head into Memorial Stadium as 3.5-point favorites over the Huskers.</p>

      <p>Iowa is coming off a 19-10 win over Illinois, which was preceded by a huge win over previously unbeaten Minnesota. At 8-3 on the season, they could exceed last year’s regular season win total next weekend.</p>
      <p>Nebraska, on the other hand, is coming off a 54-7 win over lowly Maryland and now sit at 5-6 on the season. The Huskers need a win in order to become bowl eligible for the first time since 2016.</p>
      <p>Recent history certainly seems to favor the Hawkeyes. They’ve won four straight against Nebraska and have not lost in Lincoln since 2011.</p>
      <p>It may not be the most high-stakes game of rivalry weekend. But it’s going to feel supremely important for everyone playing.</p>
