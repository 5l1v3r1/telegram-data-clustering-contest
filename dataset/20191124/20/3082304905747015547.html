        <b>Kylian Mbappe has scored nine goals in 12 games for Paris Saint-Germain this season but said he still suffers from self-doubt</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kylian Mbappe tipped Barcelona’s Lionel Messi to win the Ballon d’Or and admitted that he has suffered from bouts of self-doubt during an injury-plagued year at Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
      <p>France international Mbappe was fourth in the shortlist for the 2018 Ballon d’Or and won the Kopa Trophy, presented to the best-performing player under the age of 21.</p>
      <p>After scoring 33 goals in 29 Ligue 1 appearances for the French champions in 2018-19, Mbappe has been restricted to just five starts this term.</p>
      <p>He has nevertheless scored five league goals but backed the legendary Messi to collect the gong for world’s best player for a sixth time, telling Spiegel: “In individual terms he [Messi] was the best this year.”</p>
      <p>“Sometimes I’m worried,” Mbappe continued. “I’m scared, if you fail as a player, you have doubts, and when you lose in a big match, the question is, is this the end of it? It was nice, but now it’s over!</p>
      <p>“But it does not last long, because the good thing about football is that you do not have much time to think.”</p>

      <p>Mbappe has scored nine goals in 12 games across all competitions in 2019-20 despite spending much of the campaign sidelined by hamstring, thigh and adductor problems.</p>
      <p>He said another issue affecting him at PSG is the language barrier between him and German coach Thomas Tuchel, but said the 46-year-old makes certain words loud and clear.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, I do not know nice words in German,” said Mbappe.</p>
      <p>“Just swear words like s***, my trainer is German and he always says that when something bugs him: s***, s***!”</p>
