      <p>X-Force is supposed to operate as the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/x-men">X-Men</a>'s version of the Central Intelligence Agency, but so far the team is failing at its job. With mutants getting a new lease on life and independence through the island nation of Krakoa, the odds have never been this stacked in their favor before. This is probably why their enemies are working like never before to bring the mutant society crashing to the ground.</p>
      <p>While we have seen Orchis -- an offshoot of Hydra, A.I.M., S.H.I.E.L.D. and other organizations banded together -- in battle with the X-Men in <i>House of X</i>, there are plenty more threats rising from the shadows. One of those was a squad of soldiers that successfully infiltrated Krakoa to assassinate Charles Xavier. <i>X-Force</i> #1 shocked readers with Xavier's death, even though it has already been established that the X-Men have a way to cheat death with The Five (Hope Summers, Goldballs/Egg, Proteus, Tempus and Elixir) and the mutant resurrection protocols.</p>

      <p>Be that as it may, Xavier is still deceased as we head into a preview of <i>X-Force</i> #2. Of course, Wolverine is already on the case, following the assassins' tracks to an airport in South Korea. While Logan attempts to break into a computer system for answers, an unexpecting guard walks in on his break-in. Just as Wolverine is about to strike the guard down, he finds himself levitating in midair, thanks to the intervention of Quentin Quire, aka Kid Omega.</p>

      <p>Quentin Quire is one of the 14 characters designated as an Omega-level mutant in a <i>House of X</i> #1 data page, with his Omega power listed as Telepathy. Kid Omega and Wolverine became somewhat close during <i>Wolverine and the X-Men</i> when Logan was running the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. Always stubborn and narcissistic, Quentin was last seen as a member of Kate Bishop's West Coast Avengers.</p>
      <p>The preview of <i>X-Force</i> #2 reveals Quentin is already ahead of Wolverine in his investigation of Xavier's murder case. "I'm here because the Professor <i>finally</i> realized what I've been preaching all along," Quentin tells Wolverine. "Mutants are @#$%&amp; superior. Or at least I am." Quentin has already processed the assassins' false IDs and surveyed the surveillance footage. The duo now has a lead on getting payback against the individuals who dared to openly attack Krakoa.</p>
      <p>The combination of a pissed off <a href="https://screenrant.com/new-wolverine-comic-preview/">Wolverine</a> and Omega-level Quentin Quire should be enough to defeat any opposition they run into.</p>
