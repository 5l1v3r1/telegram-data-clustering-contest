      <p>Crossovers are really popular in Europe right now, the smaller the better. Bold designs are a pretty common sight, but there's nothing quite like the 2008. This fresh model looks expensive, as if it could wear Range Rover badges or BMW badges.</p>
      <p>Because of its high price, the car probably can't rise to the top of the segment, currently secured by the <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2020-peugeot-2008-vs-renault-captur-new-french-crossover-comparison-138387.html">Renault Captur. </a>But it's the runner up in France, and the comparison with the first generation is pretty interesting.</p>
      <p>This video from French magazine L'argus makes things pretty clear. This new model is based on the company‚Äôs Common Modular Platform It's 14 cm longer than before, a bit wider too.</p>
      <p>The shape's different too. Like a smaller version of the successful 3008, it's got a tall hood, futuristic creases, and feline lights. The two-tone paint job replaces the ugly step in the old car's roof.</p>
      <p>Much like the <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2020-peugeot-208-stands-next-to-predecessor-looks-more-expensive-135934.html">smaller 208 hatchback</a>, the new Peugeot 2008 is or will be offered with petrol, diesel, and electric powertrains. In terms of gas burners, customers will be able to opt between three different 1.2-liter PureTech three-cylinder turbo unit pumping out 100hp, 130hp, and 155hp respectively. A 1.5-liter BlueHDI diesel version with 100hp is also on offer with a manual transmission. By the end of next year, we should also see the e-2008 with 136hp and a 50 <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/k.html#ge-kilowatt-hour"><u>kWh</u></a> battery pack, enough for a decent <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/e.html#ge-electric-vehicle"><u>EV</u></a> range.</p>
      <p>The technology on offer also sets them apart. For example, there is the Drive Assist system which includes lane positioning assist, lane departure warning, and adaptive cruise control with Stop &amp; Go. On top of this, you can have smart headlights, auto parking and more. And what about that dashboard design? There's nothing on the market quite like the 3D i-Cockpit. üèÅ</p>
