      <h2>‘Experiment’ highlights fear broadcasters are pulling back from big rights deals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:00:27+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Murad Ahmed</a></address>
      <p>European football’s governing body is exploring the creation of its own internet streaming service to show <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9f37137a-d3c8-11e9-a0bd-ab8ec6435630">Champions League</a> matches in response to growing fears that traditional broadcasters are pulling back from sports rights deals.</p>
      <p>Uefa, the organisers of the Champions League, is in the midst of a country-by-country auction for television deals to show its major team competitions between 2021 and 2024. So far, the US network CBS and the UK telecoms group and sports broadcaster BT have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2fc0c86c-079c-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd">acquired</a> the rights in their respective home markets.</p>
      <p>But Theodore Theodoridis, Uefa’s general secretary, said it was weighing up the option of pulling back from selling rights to TV networks in some markets during the current auction in order to provide matches online instead.</p>
      <p>This could be done through expanding the UefaTV online site into a broader “over the top” (OTT) internet channel, which would allow millions of fans to stream matches. Such a move would represent a radical shift from the current model of selling screening rights to traditional broadcasters in deals worth €3.25bn a year worldwide.</p>
      <p>“For now, we have lots of [broadcast] partners and are looking forward to continuing our partnerships,” said Mr Theodoridis. “We just want to be ready. We just want to have alternative options.”</p>
      <p>Pay-TV groups, such as Sky in the UK, have signalled they are increasingly unwilling to spend <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/667bceb4-696a-11e8-8cf3-0c230fa67aec">ever greater sums</a> on sports rights as it becomes harder to push that cost on to stretched consumers.</p>
      <p>In recent years, internet companies have joined the battle to screen football, with Amazon <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f121c77a-6a65-11e8-8cf3-0c230fa67aec">buying the rights</a> to screen some English Premier League matches starting this season. Even in these cases, technology companies have not shown a willingness to pay more than traditional broadcasters have in the past.</p>
      <p>Enders Analysis, a media analyst group, last month released a report declaring that the “TV rights boom [in football] is ending,” particularly in Europe’s “big five” domestic leagues in England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France.</p>
      <p>“The mediocre local prospects for future [football rights] auctions reflect headwinds common to all major pay-TV markets, despite their national differences: subscriber growth has slowed or reversed, and retail prices are subject to downward pressure,” the report said.</p>

      <p>In response to these concerns, Mr Theodoridis said Uefa was seeking to “experiment” with its own internet streaming channel in a few national markets outside Europe, where current broadcast deals are worth no more €5m-€10m a year.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the governing body will consider moving to an online model in any national market where TV broadcasters offer far less to screen Champions League matches than Uefa projects the matches are worth.</p>
      <p>The launch of an OTT network would still need the full support of clubs but could also be done through separate deals with local telecoms providers or internet and social media groups, added Mr Theodoridis.</p>
      <p>Over time, Uefa could then build a new business model similar to some major <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb729050-7321-11e9-bf5c-6eeb837566c5">US</a> sports leagues, such as Major League Baseball, which has created its own internet subscription service with annual revenues worth an estimated $620m.</p>
      <p>“Traditional broadcasting has been there for sport and for football in general,” he said. “Now we need to explore, also for the digital side. That’s what we’re trying to do.”</p>
