      <p>Reality star, model and entrepreneur Kylie Jenner has just sold a majority stake in her cosmetics company to CoverGirl owner Coty for $600 million.</p>
      <p>Her sisters Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Kendall have posted on social multiple times in the 24 hours since then.</p>
      <p>None of them mentioned about Kylie’s business deal.</p>
      <p>Khloe Kardashian took it to Instagram to celebrate the ‘OG trio’ which is herself, Kourtney and Kim in a frangrance promo.</p>

      <p>The Internet was abuzz after 22-year-old Kylie Jenner sold a majority stake in her cosmetics company.</p>
      <p>Her own family did not seem to be interested in the world’s youngest ever self-made billionaire.</p>
      <p>Checking through the Kardashian-Jenner’s social media accounts in the past 24 hours, you may think that her sisters Kim, Khloe, Kourtney and Kendall are seething about her achievement.</p>
      <p>As Kylie’s mum and manager, Kris Jenner may have something to say on the subject but not one of her siblings had any comment.</p>
      <p>35-year-old Khloe Kardashian celebrated the ‘OG trio’ which is the original Keeping Up With The Kardashians stars, herself and sisters Kourtney and Kim.</p>
      <p>She uploaded a post that promotes the trio’s new KKW fragrance.</p>
      <p>Khloe also uploaded a photo of her beautiful home with no mention about Kylie’s achievement.</p>
      <p>It was surprising because for fans of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she is the closest family member to Kylie.</p>
      <p>Kris noted that it was a moment for our family to be proud but other than that, the rest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan did not acknowledge the huge payday.</p>
      <p>As for Kim, she was plugging her Skims range, her Rodney Reed interview with Jenna Bush as well as her KKW Beauty line and fragrances.</p>

      <p>The 39-year-old reality star congratulated Khloe’s bestie Malika Haqq and her sister on their new show as well as celebrating her own makeup artist and collaborator Mario’s influencer award.</p>
      <p>Kim also professed her love for husband Kanye West and daughter Chicago.</p>
      <p>Four years ago, before Kylie launched her $29 lipkits, Kim was the most successful reality star in history making millions in endorsement deals.</p>
      <p>Kim’s estimated $370 million personal net worth is now beaten by her younger sister’s recent achievement.</p>
      <p>Kylie cited Kim as her biggest inspiration and while Kim is proud of what her sister has done, Kylie’s achievement may be grating on the mother-of-four.</p>
      <p>Kim worked for more than two decades to reach her level of success while Kylie launched her lipskits with just an Instagram post four years ago.</p>
      <p>Kourtney Kardashian plugged her KKW beauty fragrance and Poosh website via Instagram stories in the past 24 hours while Kendall Jenner posted an ad for her Proativ range.</p>
      <p>The sisters didn’t find time to thank their baby sister and instead promoted their own products.</p>
      <p>64-year-old Kris Jenner said that it was a big day for daughter Kylie and that it was a moment for the family to be proud.</p>
      <p>It was a ‘crystallization of all our work’, she added.</p>
      <p>51-percent of Kylie’s makeup and skincare businesses were sold to beauty company Coty which owns around 77 brands including CoverGirl, Hugo Boss, Burberry, Rimmel and Max Factor – in exchange for the lump sum.</p>
      <p>Kylie said that she is excited to partner with Coty to reach to more fans of Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin around the world.</p>
      <p>She is also looking forward to continue the creativity and ingenuity for each collection.</p>
      <p>The deal isn’t expected to close until the third quarter of the fiscal year 2020 but shares in Coty have shot up by 5 per cent.</p>
