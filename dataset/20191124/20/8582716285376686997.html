      <p><b>TOKYO — </b>Bad debts written off by Japan's regional banks doubled in the six months to September from a year earlier, reflecting the slow recovery of the country's local economies, according to data recently compiled by an investment bank.</p>
      <p>Of 78 listed regional banks in Japan, 77 had disposed of non-performing loans totaling 105.8 billion yen during the period, including loans which the banks set provisions against, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co said.</p>
      <p>The data excluded Suruga Bank which posted an unusually large loss a year earlier due to write-offs of massive murky loans for building investment-purpose shared houses.</p>
      <p>The banks' financial results for the term also showed that 56 of them saw their net profits fall, including two which fell into the red.</p>
      <p>The regional banks are suffering the double whammy of sluggish local economies hurting the businesses of their borrowers and the Bank of Japan's ultraeasy monetary policy squeezing spreads in lending.</p>
      <p>Most of Japan's major banking groups have also reported declining profits in the same period, with earnings from overseas operations unable to make up for weak domestic businesses.</p>
