      <h2>Report from Bristol City's clash against Man City in the Women's Super League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:11:45+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:11</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Swift, Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City kept the pressure on in the race for the Barclays FA Women’s Super League title as they cruised to a 5-0 victory against Bristol City at the Stoke Gifford Stadium.</p>
      <p>But the visitors were made to work hard for their win by a hardworking Robins side, with three of their goals coming in the final ten minutes.</p>
      <p>Though the Blues dominated the opening half in terms of possession, they had only one goal to show by the interval, Tessa Wullaert swivelling to fire home from ten yards after Janine Beckie’s 20th-minute cross had evaded the head of defender Meaghan Sargeant.</p>
      <p>Bristol City keeper Sophie Baggaley had to make a low save to smother an angled shot from England international Ellen White just before the half-hour, and was soon in action again as she did well to rise and snaffle a dangerous high cross, despite getting clattered by White in the process.</p>

      <p>Bristol City had struggled to create much in the way of a threat, although that started to change in the second half following the introduction of substitute Ebony Salmon.</p>
      <p>The former Manchester United forward created their first real chance of the game in the 51st minute when she broke down the left and cut inside before unleashing a shot which keeper Ellie Roebuck saved, while Jasmine Matthews headed over the bar from the resulting corner.</p>
      <p>Shortly afterwards, Roebuck had to advance quickly to smother the danger as Salmon threatened again.</p>
      <p>But the visitors made the home side pay for some slack defending as they netted their second goal in the 65th minute, White in acres of space to latch on to Keira Walsh’s pass to go through one-on-one before coolly slotting the ball through Baggaley's legs.</p>
      <p>The outcome was put beyond doubt as Manchester City grabbed three more goals in the closing 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>Substitute Pauline Bremer had only been on the pitch for four minutes when she fired home the visitors’ third from the edge of the box, and former Robins player Caroline Weir made it four just three minutes from time when she blasted home with her left foot from 20 yards.</p>
      <p>German international Bremer rounded things off in the final minutes as she broke through one-on-one before firing the fifth past Baggaley.</p>
      <p><b>Manchester City’s Jill Scott said:</b> “We knew Bristol would be well organised because we’ve had some tough games here in the past, but the pleasing thing was that we stayed patient and got goals late on to kill the game off.</p>
      <p>“It’s tight at the top of the table and we know the pressure is on us to keep getting points, but all we can do is concentrate on ourselves and make sure keep on picking up wins.</p>
      <p>“We had a couple of bad results earlier in the season which some people wanted to focus on, but we just have keep on playing well, improving our game and the rest will take care of itself.</p>
      <p>“You only need to look at the players we have got along with those on the bench and you can see we have a good team with a good attitude and plenty of team spirit.”</p>
      <p><b>Bristol City boss Tanya Oxtoby said: </b>“We’ve had three games in just over a week and I think you could see that has taken its toll today – especially in the closing stages, when we conceded some needless, sloppy goals.</p>
      <p>“I thought our resilience over 75 minutes and the way we stuck together was excellent, but our concentration was affected in the last 15 minutes and that was a little bit disappointing.</p>
      <p>“We massively over-achieved last season and we have had more investment this season than we have ever had. But you look at the quality of some of the big clubs in this league and you can see they have invested even more and got even better, which is why we are where we are.</p>
      <p>“What’s going to be important for us is that we get results when we play the other teams around us in the table and I have no doubts we are capable of doing that.”</p>
