      <p>Christian Roach decorates his house every year at <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> time - but this year's trimmings look a little different.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old, from <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/tonypandy">Trealaw</a> in the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/rhondda">Rhondda</a> , has decided to spread a useful message, rather than a traditional festive one.</p>
      <p>Outside his home, among all the lights, you'll find the words "check your nuts".</p>
      <p>It comes after Christian's battle with testicular cancer, which has prompted him to spread his message, urging men to keep a check of things downstairs.</p>

      <p>Christian said: "This time last year I had problems - I had testicular cancer. I found out this time last year.</p>
      <p>"I went to the doctors and they said I had testicular cancer. I then had to have an operation, to have a testicle removed and I was laid up for about two months. And then I had chemotherapy.</p>
      <p>"Now I've got to go to tests for five years."</p>
      <p>While now, he's happy to talk openly about what happened to him, last year was a very different story.</p>
      <p>"It hit me for six, it was hard," he said.</p>
      <p>"Going back when I had it, if someone had said I'd be doing something like this now, I wouldn't have thought so If I'm honest.</p>

      <p>The "check your nuts" message is important to Christian, so he decided to take it a step further than just trying to raise awareness on social media.</p>
      <p>He receives messages daily and talks to men about what they're going through and his own experience.</p>
      <p>And he's had lots of people stop and stare at the unusual decorations outside his home.</p>
      <p>"I said to my partner, I'd like to put something outside the house. It started off as a bit of joke," he said.</p>
      <p>Christian and his partner Nicola got some wood and made a sign and painted it.</p>

      <p>He said: "Nicola trimmed it up for me, and put it outside the house.</p>
      <p>"We've always decorated outside the house, but not to this extreme.</p>
      <p>"The sign's got 750 lights on it so it is glowing up a bit," he laughed.</p>
      <p>"I put a picture on Facebook and it's gone a bit crazy. We're having people pulling up outside the house and taking random pictures."</p>
      <p>"We had Chinese last night and the delivery man came here and I had to explain to him what it meant," he laughed.</p>
