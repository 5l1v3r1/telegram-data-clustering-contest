      <p>Moseamedi was the hero after netting a brace to hand the Team of Choice a 2-1 victory over the Soweto giants on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>"It was tough, it was not easy but we planned very well for them. We knew how they attack, they utilise their tall strikers upfront but we kept to our shape and plan and that's why we ended up victorious today," Moseamedi told SuperSport TV after receiving his Man of the Match accolade.</p>
      <p>"We've been working very hard, looking forward to the final. Today we came together and did the job collectively, that's why you see now we're happy. We're celebrating with our fans," he continued.</p>
      <p>"Each and every cup game we took it as it came, for this one we knew it was going to be tough.</p>
      <p>"Our coach kept on telling us that we shouldn't put ourselves under pressure, we must just continue doing the basics and we'll end up getting it right."</p>
      <p>Eric Tinkler's men will now face Mamelodi Sundowns in the final at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on 14 December 2019.</p>
