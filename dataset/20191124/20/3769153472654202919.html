However, there will be a blocking in the beginning before you start with your detailed mesh. You need to plan the structure of your level and test it - again and again!<br/><br/>When you are finished with the blocking, it is time to start with the detailed mesh modeling... This is my personal method to do an retopology for an low-poly level design (organic structure).<br/>Maybe there will be something which will help you as well :)<br/><br/>Cheers!</blockquote>
