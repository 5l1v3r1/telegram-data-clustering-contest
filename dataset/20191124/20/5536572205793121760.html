      <h1>Rob Gronkowski Scolds Tom Brady, Patriots For Their Negativity: ‘I Don’t Miss That’ (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>Like most people, Rob Gronkowski noticed Tom Brady’s reaction to the New England Patriots’ win over the Philadelphia Eagles last week and he instantly knew that he did not miss playing for the Patriots.</p>
      <p>Brady was upset about the offense not being able to get it together and even expressed deeper frustrations in a radio interview on WEEI 24 hours after the game.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Gronk, who is serving as an NFL analyst for FOX, basically called out his former team for being so negative after a loss.</p>
      <blockquote>“He’s so frustrated, too. It’s like, ‘Yo, you guys are 9-1.’ That’s one part I don’t miss about being there. Hand down. I’m not going to lie. I don’t miss that,” Gronkowski said on air before Sunday’s Week 12 games began. “They’re frustrated. They’re 9-1. They win a game against Philly last week. We lost to them two years ago in the Super Bowl. They should be happy. Instead, you’re sitting there Sunday night thinking, ‘What did I do wrong?’ No, that’s not the feeling you should be having. But you won the game. Enjoy it. Go out next week, and build off it.”</blockquote>

      <p>As far as Gronk coming back to the Patriots this season, he also cleared those rumors by stating he would not.</p>
