      <p>But his cash plan was scuppered when it emerged the Weirs, from Largs, Ayrshire, were <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4761328/euromillions-winner-colin-weir-launches-takeover-bid-for-scottish-championship-club-partick-thistle/">Partick Thistle</a> fans.</p>
      <p>A source said of the 2011 plot: “Whyte was desperate to attract more investment.</p>
      <p>“He would have happily sold 20 per cent of his share to the ‘great and good’ of Glasgow.</p>
      <p>“The Weirs would have been perfect with all the money they had come into.</p>

      <p>“A charm offensive would have been launched to entice them. But sadly they were Thistle fans.”</p>
      <p>Mr Grier, who later worked for Gers administrators Duff &amp; Phelps, wrote in an email: “See a couple from Largs have won £160million.</p>
      <p>"Let’s find out if Rangers fan and invite to the club.”</p>
      <p>The Ibrox club went bust less than a year later over a £9million unpaid tax bill.</p>
      <p>We can also reveal a mystery female was prepared to pump £5million into the ailing giants.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She pulled out at the 11th hour as it emerged Mr Whyte was previously banned from being a company director.</p>
      <p>The source added: “She was offered a seat in the directors box for life.”</p>
      <p>Colin, 71, and Christine, 62, <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4821218/euromillions-results-numbers-winners-bayford-weir/">split</a> in April.</p>
      <p>Colin <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4759005/euromillions-colin-weir-partick-thistle-bid/">bought control</a> of his beloved Jags last week.</p>
