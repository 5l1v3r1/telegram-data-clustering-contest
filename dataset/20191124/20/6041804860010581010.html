      <p>Looks like the controversy that was said to be not there with regard to ‘<a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/movienews/tamil-arjun-reddy-adithya-varma-gets-pin-drop-silence/">Adithya Varma</a>‘ related to the misogynist stance came in a different way. Dhruv Vikram was served government notice for excessive smoking and drinking scenes in his debut film.</p>
      <p>It’s not only just Dhruv Vikram who was served notices but also senior actress Radhika Sharat Kumar for featuring in cigar smoking scenes for her upcoming film ‘Market Raja MBBS’.</p>
      <p>Radhika is playing a rough village woman role and was seen smoking a cigar in the posters that came out. These posters didn’t have the statutory warning about how smoking cigarettes is injurious to health. These scenes are punishable offences if the statutory warning wasn’t displayed.</p>
      <p>For ‘Adithya Varma’, the controversy seems to have come from the other way. The aggressive misogynist behaviour of the lead actor didn’t come under criticism for Tamil Arjun Reddy, strangely.</p>
      <p>Now, let’s see if the makers would opt to cut out the cigarette smoking and drinking scenes from the movie.</p>
