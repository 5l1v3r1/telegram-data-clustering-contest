      <p>Toronto's fire chief says a captain who was critically injured while battling a blaze earlier this month has been released from hospital.</p>
      <p>Chief Matthew Pegg shared a photo on Twitter showing Capt. James Warren leaving a downtown hospital flanked by a fellow firefighter.</p>
      <p>Warren was rushed to the intensive care unit on November 2 when he fell off a roof while helping extinguish a fire at an abandoned building in the city's downtown core.</p>
      <p>The other firefighter shown in Pegg's photo also fell off the roof, but was less seriously injured.</p>
      <p>According to Pegg, the two firefighters said they came into the hospital together and would leave together as well.</p>
      <p>The fire is being investigated as arson and police are still searching for a suspect.</p>
