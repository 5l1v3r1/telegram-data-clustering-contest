      <p>The head of the NYPD’s detectives union will retire after 15 years at the group’s helm, The Post has learned.</p>
      <p>Detectives’ Endowment Association President Michael Palladino will file his pension paperwork at 1 Police Plaza at 11 a.m. Monday morning, and plans to hang up his hat in mid-January, the 41-year veteran said Sunday.</p>
      <p>“My inner desire has been to help people and make a difference for the better,” said Palladino, who joined the force in 1979 and spent most of his career in The Bronx’s 43rd and 52nd precincts.</p>
      <p>“I believed then and I still believe today that good must prevail over evil,” he said. “I think that it’s just too bad that the majority of today’s elected officials choose to embrace evil at the expense of the law-abiding citizen.”</p>
      <p>Palladino — whose wife, Theresa, is a retired detective and whose son Joseph serves on the NYPD — plans to go into the private sector as a consultant for the Rockland County-based Brosnan Risk Consultants and serve as president of the National Police Defense Foundation.</p>
      <p>“My plate is pretty full,” he said.</p>
      <p>Palladino, who was elected to the union’s top spot in 2004, plans to hand the reigns over to vice-president Paul Digiacomo when he retires in January. Digiacomo will finish the term, ending June 2020, and the union will hold elections in the spring.</p>
      <p>The detective, “humbled and moved” that his retirement would be news, said he “gave the members and the NYPD 150 percent.”</p>
      <p>“I leave behind an organization that is financially sound with an impeccable reputation for a blueprint for future leaders to follow,” he said.</p>
