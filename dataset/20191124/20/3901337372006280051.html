      <p>The Red Devils made only one change from their win over Brighton and Hove Albion, with Phil Jones replacing Scott McTominay to slot into the back three alongside Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire, who captained the side against his former club.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's charges were lucky not to concede very early after shot-stopper David De Gea pulled off two great saves  to deny John Lundstram and David McGoldrick in quick succession.</p>
      <p>De Gea almost saved Man United again in the 19th minute after saving Lundstram's low shot inside the box from a through ball but John Fleck reacted quickly to tuck home from the rebound for the lead.</p>
      <p>The Blades kept on pressurising the visitors and that did not give Solskjaer's men time to breathe and settle, as they hardly created any chance going forward for the remainder of the half.</p>
      <p>Wilder's men continued to ask questions of the Red Devils' defence early in the second stanza and they doubled the lead seven minutes into the second stanza after Lys Mousset curled home a powerful intoo the bottom corner from the edge of the box.</p>

      <p>Man United were showing the sense of urgency to get to the game and they finally pulled a goal back with 18 minutes remaining courtesy of teenage left-back Brandon Williams, who rifled home a first-time volley into the far corner following a cross from Daniel James.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer made a change immediately thereafter after bringing on Mason Greenwood, who tucked home the equaliser barely three minutes after coming on after Marcus Rashford delivered an inviting cross into the six-yard area,</p>
      <p>Man United completed a remarkable comeback as Rashford got the third goal with 11 minutes remaining after burying a left-footed strike at the near post past Moore after being setup by James.</p>
      <p>However, Sheffield found a dramatic equaliser in the last minute as Oliver McBurnie smashed a volley past De Gea from a Callum Robinson's cross on a counter-attack and the goal had to go through the Video Assistant Referee checks for a potential handball but the on-field referee's decision was not changed as the sides shared the spoils in the end.</p>
