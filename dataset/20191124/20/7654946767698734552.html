      <p>The Greg Schiano pipe dream is officially over.</p>
      <p>The former Rutgers football coach, who took the program to new heights during his 11-year tenure, will not be returning to the program as head coach, according to multiple reports. Schiano was in talks with school officials about a comeback, and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/rutgers-and-greg-schiano-need-each-other-more-than-ever/">there was optimism it could happen</a>, but a deal never materialized.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/Brett_McMurphy/status/1198685321438879746?s=20">Stadium’s Brett McMurphy</a>, Rutgers offered Schiano an eight-year, $32 million contract. <a href="https://www.nj.com/rutgersfootball/2019/11/greg-schiano-will-not-be-rutgers-head-coach-deal-falls-through.html">NJ.com reports</a> Schiano “acquiesced on several key issues,” but he and the school still couldn’t agree to a deal.</p>
      <p>Rutgers fired Chris Ash on Sept. 29, the day after an embarrassing 52-0 loss to Michigan. The Scarlet Knights fell to 2-9 (0-8 in the Big Ten) with a Saturday loss to Michigan State.</p>
