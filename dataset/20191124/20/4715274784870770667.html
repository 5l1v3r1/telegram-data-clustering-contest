      <p>To make the festivities twice as merry, vibrant, and colorful, there’s the new Nilagang Pasko, Max’s own take on the well-loved pochero dish. It features a tender trio of beef bulalo, cured meat, and chicken submerged in a rich annatto oil-infused broth with potatoes, pechay, squash, sweet potatoes, green beans, and saba banana. </p>
      <p>Nilagang Pasko is also available for sharing with the Holiday Classics Supreme Bundle—a spread consisting of one hearty bowl of Nilagang Pasko, one regular whole Sarap-To-The Bones Fried Chicken, a choice of one Pancit, Chopsuey, or Lumpiang Shanghai, one Large Plain Rice, five glasses of iced tea, soft drinks, or sago’t gulaman, and five regular Buko Pandan. This feast for five is priced at P1,799.</p>
      <p>Cap off every get-together with Bibingka Cheesecake, Max’s Corner Bakery’s unique take on the classic Filipino Christmas staple. For only P249, this extraordinary kakanin and cheesecake concoction is a marriage of soft, fluffy vanilla chiffon and smooth and silky cheesecake, generously topped with salted egg slices. This delightful treat is wrapped in banana leaves. </p>
      <p>Max’s Corner Bakery also offers Caramel Fudge Cake, which is an incredibly moist and fudgy chocolate cake elevated with luxurious caramel icing and piped chocolate fudge, priced at P687.</p>
      <p>The new Nilagang Pasko and Holiday Classics Supreme Bundle is available at all Max’s Restaurant branches nationwide, and Bibingka Cheesecake and Caramel Fudge Cake in all Luzon stores only. The limited-edition offering is available until Jan. 3, 2020. </p>

        <b>Trays of treats</b>
      </p>
      <p>Parties and get-togethers can be quite stressful, so many things to plan, consider, accomplish. This is where party trays come in handy. </p>
      <p>Pancake House eases many hosts’ worries with its To-Go Trays, each is good for up to 15 persons.</p>
      <p>The To-Go Trays include orders of Pancake House’s famous Classic Pan Chicken, special Spaghetti with Meat Sauce and Garlic Bread, crisp Fish Rolls, meaty Pork Vienna, flavorful Roast Beef with Mashed Potato, and Plain or Garlic Rice.
