      <p>Rating agency CRISIL has said Karvy group’s liquidity will remain under pressure over the medium-term because of large working capital requirements. According to CRISIL, the outlook on liquidity is negative. Its net cash accrual may remain healthy at Rs 120 - 140 crore per annum but the sizeable annual repayment obligations of Rs 42-53 crore, along with stretched working capital cycle, will continue to exert pressure on liquidity, the rating agency said.</p>
      <p>CRISIL has downgraded its ratings on the bank facilities and non- convertible debentures (NCDs) of Karvy Data Management Services (KDMSL) from “BBB+/negative” to “BB+/Negative”. The downgrade in the overall ratings reflects the weakening of the KDMSL group’s financial risk profile, especially liquidity.</p>
      <p>The weakening of profile is on the account of increasing working capital requirements, primarily due to delays in realisation of receivables and raising funds. A delay in realisation of receivables, especially from the Andhra Pradesh government and increase in realisation period from large customer in subsidiaries’ contact center business, exerts pressure on the group’s liquidity.</p>
      <p>Execution of big government projects and their realisation will remain key monitorables, CRISIL said.</p>
      <p>Pointing to strengths of the group, CRISIL has highlighted some factors like strong support from Karvy <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/stock-broking">Stock Broking </a>(KSBL) ultimate holding company of KDMSL.</p>
      <p>KDMSL group benefits financially, operationally, and managerially from KSBL. KSBL, has provided corporate guarantee backing the bank lines availed by KDMSL.</p>
