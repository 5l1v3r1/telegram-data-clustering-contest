      <h1>Razer Phone 2 on sale for all-time low of $300 ($100 off)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:06:17+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/jules-wang/" target="_blank">Jules Wang</a></address>
      <p>Those who have come into contact with <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/90hz/">super-fast refresh rate displays</a> have hyped them to be a big-time ruiner for anyone going back to 60Hz or less. Razer brought a 120Hz experience to mobile with its phones and while their viability has been in question, you'd probably still be interested in giving <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/27/razer-phone-2-review-still-fun-still-niche/">the Razer Phone 2</a> a try. Lucky for you, the company's dropping this ol' reliable down to its lowest price yet.</p>
      <p>Alright, yes, a <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/razer-phone-3-release-date-news,38844.html">Razer Phone 3</a> might not be happening (at least this year...) and that doesn't exactly instill confidence about the software support timeline. But remember that the phone itself is barely <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/10/10/razer-phone-2-delivers-camera-upgrade-wireless-charging-and-most-importantly-rgb-lights/">a year old</a>, has some good cooling stacked on top of its Snapdragon 845, and has a respectable LED glow-up config. Oh yeah, and that 120Hz display. Fun stuff to play around with.</p>
