      <p>Goo had previously spoken out against cyberbullying - and in June said it was difficult to overcome depression and pleaded for positive comments on social media.</p>
      <p>Another K-pop star, Sulli, a former member of girl group f(x), who was a close friend of Goo and had also spoken out against cyberbullying, also died in October.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/south-korea.html">South Korea</a> has one of the world's highest rates of suicide which, according to recent government figures, is among the top causes of death for those under 40. </p>
      <p>Goo debuted with the five-member <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/music.html">band</a> Kara in 2008. It was one of the early girl groups that helped fan the global K-pop wave, building large fan bases in Japan, China and other countries.</p>
      <p>After performing with Kara from 2008 to 2015, she focused on her solo career after the group broke up and had just completed a tour of Japan with her latest release.</p>
      <p>In messages posted on social media, fans mourned Goo's death with one writing: "I hope you have a good sleep in heaven without any worries."</p>
