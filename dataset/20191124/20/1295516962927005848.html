      <p>Gossett Jr. gushed to the interviewer, saying, "I love that girl. I love Regina to death. She’s only just begun. We could read the telephone book together, I wouldn’t mind. [Laughs.] She’s the best. I gave her some little hints, and she bit the hook. Then she came back to me and I bit the hooks. So we made a little magic together, and I sometimes feel like maybe in some other lifetime we were relatives anyway. But it was a pleasure to play all the little secrets and all stuff. And I got her attention, I got her curiosity. That makes for a full relationship on camera. It was just wonderful."</p>
