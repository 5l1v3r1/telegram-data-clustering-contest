      <h1>Frank Gore passes Sanders for No. 3 on rushing list</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:49:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:49</time> by <a rel="author">Marcel Louis-Jacques</a></address>
      <p>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills">Buffalo Bills</a> running back <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8479/frank-gore">Frank Gore</a> became the NFL's third-leading career rusher Sunday, eclipsing the 15,269-yard mark set by Barry Sanders.</p>
      <p>Gore officially passed Sanders on a 6-yard run in the fourth quarter of the Bills' game against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos">Denver Broncos</a>. Now in his 15th season, Gore previously became the fourth player to rush for 15,000 career yards during the Bills' Week 4 game against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</a>.</p>
      <p>The former Miami Hurricane pulled himself within striking distance on a 27-yard run midway through the third quarter before officially stepping onto the NFL's all-time podium with just over nine minutes left in the game. Gore had just 54 combined rushing yards in his past three games but had amassed 43 yards on eight carries at the time he passed Sanders' career mark.</p>
      <p>He signed with the Bills this offseason after stints in Miami and Indianapolis, but began his career in 2005 as the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a>' third-round pick, rushing for 608 yards in 14 games. That still stands as the fewest yards he has rushed for in a single season; Gore ran for 1,000 or more yards in nine of the following 13 seasons, although he is projected to fall just short of that mark this season.</p>
      <p>A model of durability, playing in 217 of 231 possible games, Gore, 36, could finish his career in his current position on the all-time list. He's roughly 1,500 yards from the No. 2 rusher, Walter Payton, and 3,000 yards from the all-time leader, Emmitt Smith.</p>
