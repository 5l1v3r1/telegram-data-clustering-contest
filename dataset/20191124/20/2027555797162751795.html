      <h1>Bolivia's interim Prez to sign off on new elections</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:37:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Bolivia's interim President Jeanine Anez will sign off on new elections that exclude Evo Morales on Sunday, which are seen as a crucial step to ending weeks of unrest in the crisis-hit country.</p>
      <p>Congress on Saturday gave the green light for a new ballot after accusations the October 20 election, which Morales claimed to have won, was rigged.</p>
      <p>Anez said she would sign the bill, approved by both houses during hours-long sessions, at 1400 GMT.</p>
      <p>Among other things, the proposal annuls the results of the October 20 vote and allows for new elections to be held.</p>
      <p>It also bars candidates who served in both of the two previous terms from seeking re-election for the same position.</p>
      <p>That would prevent Morales -- Bolivia's first indigenous president who served for nearly 14 years -- from contesting the presidency in the new ballot.</p>
      <p>Morales fled to Mexico after resigning on November 10 after losing the support of the military.</p>
      <p>Bolivian prosecutors are investigating accusations of sedition and terrorism against Morales, after he allegedly called on supporters to maintain blockades in the landlocked country.</p>
      <p>The next step will be for Congress to agree on a new seven-member electoral court, after members of the previous panel were removed for allegedly manipulating results.</p>
      <p>The tribunal will be tasked with setting a date for the new vote that Anez has previously vowed to hold "as soon as possible."</p>
      <p>New elections are seen as key to ending Bolivia's worst political upheaval in 16 years, which has deepened divisions between indigenous people loyal to Morales and Bolivia's mainly city-dwelling middle and upper classes.</p>
      <p>At least 32 people have been killed in violence that erupted after the disputed election, with protesters' blockades causing severe fuel and food shortages in La Paz and other cities.</p>
