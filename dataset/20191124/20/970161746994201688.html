        <b>Little Mix have announced the exciting news that they’ll be performing at BST Hyde Park next summer, while also confirming their 2020 tour.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Woman Like Me singers gathered together to make the announcement in a video on Sunday, with Jesy Nelson doing the honours of sharing the news of their BST Hyde Park show.</p>
      <p>‘We have some huge news that we are so excited about, that we want to share with you guys,’ the popstar teased.</p>
      <p>‘We are heading back on the road next year for our summer 2020 tour. This will include a date playing the legendary American Express Presents BST Hyde Park in London.’</p>
      <p>Leigh-Anne Pinnock chimed in: ‘Tickets go on sale on Thursday the 28th – get your tickets guys!’ as Jade Thirlwell and Perrie Edwards blew kisses.</p>
      <p>See you there, girls.</p>
      <p>The Black Magic hitmakers didn’t reveal the other 2020 tour dates but they’re expected to be announced on Monday.</p>

      <p>The girls barely waited until the end of their LM5 Tour, which wrapped up the UK leg with two shows at London’s O2 Arena last week. The first part of the tour, in promotion of their hit album LM5, spanned 40 shows and visited cities such as Madrid, Amsterdam, Paris and Newcastle before coming to a close.</p>
      <p>Fans Down Under will be hoping Little Mix announce shows in Australia and New Zealand after they scrapped the leg so they could work on their new album.</p>
      <p>Hours before the announcement, the group appeared at the Radio 1 Teen Awards where they confirmed they’ll be starting work on the album as soon as next week.</p>
      <p>Until then, fans can enjoy new music from Little Mix in the form of their first ever Christmas single, One I’ve Been Missing, which was released last week.</p>
      <p>Fans gave the track glowing reviews so you can bet Little Mix could be in the running for the Christmas number one.</p>
