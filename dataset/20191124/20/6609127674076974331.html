        <b>COCAINE kingpin Stephen Jamieson has been living the high life on nights out with freed cronies from his £9million drug gang.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The brazen hood, 36, splashed the cash partying with Steven Caddis, 40, at a bar in Amsterdam, Holland.</p>

      <p>Another snap shows flashy Jamieson, known as “Jimmy”, with pals including Caddis’ brother Gary, 38, at Sanctuary nightclub in Glasgow’s West End.</p>
      <p>A source said: “Jamieson and the Caddis brothers are living it up and are bold as brass.</p>
      <p>“They don’t make any secret of being close pals.”</p>
      <p>During the meet-ups Jamieson flaunted a £1,000 Moncler Down jacket and showed off a £10,000 Hublot watch.</p>
      <p>The source added: “They swagger about wearing all their designer clothes and watches.</p>
      <p>“But everybody knows what sort of people they are.”</p>
      <p>The trio and Brian McCulloch were caged in 2009 for a total of 30 years after flooding Glasgow with coke.</p>
      <p>Jamieson was freed in 2013 after serving half of his eight-year term.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear whether the partying pals have breached terms of their release with the nights out.</p>
      <p>The Parole Board for Scotland said it didn’t comment on individual cases.</p>
      <p>But a spokesman added: “A breach of licence conditions can lead to a recall to prison.”</p>
      <p>We told how Jamieson, of Paisley, is living in a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/4965436/glasgow-stephen-jamieson-drugs-stevie-malcolm-taxi/">£260,000 house</a> owned by millionaire taxi tycoon Stevie Malcolm.</p>
