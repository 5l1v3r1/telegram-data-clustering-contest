      <h1>Chevrolet's Big Truck Announcement Aimed At Ford And Tesla</h1>
      <h2>The Bow Tie refuses to be left behind.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:00:32+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>Like its cross-town rival Ford and California-based Tesla, General Motors is on track to launch its first-ever all-electric pickup truck. As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-ceo-electric-pickup/gms-electric-pickup-truck-to-go-on-sale-fall-2021-ceo-idUSKBN1XV21X">Reuters</a>, GM CEO Mary Barra has just announced the automaker's first electric pickup truck will arrive in dealerships in the fall 2021 â€“ at around the same time the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/cybertruck">Tesla Cybertruck</a> is due to hit the road. Coincidence? Probably not.</p>
      <p>"General Motors understands truck buyers and ... people who are new coming into the truck market," Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said late last week. "It will be a very capable truck, I'm pretty excited about it."</p>
      <p>Barra's announcement came on the same day Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled his controversially-styled Cybertruck. Unlike Ford, who earlier provided a preview of its all-electric pickup's towing capabilities, GM has offered few details on its battery-powered pickup. Chances are it will be sold as a Chevy.</p>

      <p>What we do know is that the unnamed truck will be built at GM's Detroit-Hamtramck plant beginning in late 2021. This factory will also build a new family of electric pickups and SUVs starting at a later date.</p>
      <p>Ford's all-electric <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/f-150">F-150</a> is also due in late 2021, though the automaker has not confirmed a precise date. Based on the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/watch-an-electric-ford-f-150-tow-more-than-a-million-pounds">demonstration preview Ford provided</a> as well as the Cybertruck's specs, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/chevrolets-electric-pickup-truck-takes-center-stage">Chevy's electric truck</a> has some big expectations to meet. The base <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-arrives-with-500-mile-range-and-39900-price-tag">$39,900 RWD Cybertruck</a>, for example, will go from 0 to 60 mph in 6.5 seconds and achieve a range of more than 250 miles on a single charge. It also offers 16 inches of ground clearance when off-road, a towing capability of up to 14,000 pounds, and a 6.5-foot bed that can carry a 3,500-pound payload. Ford has not provided any specific figures, but in its defense, it's too early for that info.</p>

      <p>All three automakers, however, will face competition from other truck makers, such as Rivian. The first <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/rivian-s-electric-pickup-more-versatile-than-we-thought">Rivian R1T</a> customer deliveries are slated for late 2020, but it will carry a base price of $69,000. Eventually, Detroit's third major truck maker, FCA's Ram, will launch its own electric truck. And in case you're wondering, chances are very likely GM's EV truck will sport far more conventional styling than Tesla's wild Cybertruck.</p>
