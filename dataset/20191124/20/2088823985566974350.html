      <p>Ten members of the SUNY Buffalo State women’s soccer team have submitted a second letter to college administrators complaining about head coach Nicholas DeMarsh, and renewed their call for discipline stemming from “unprofessional” conduct.</p>
      <p>The women, who last week quit the team in protest, reject any claim that their grievances stem from a lack of playing time and resent an administration response to them. One of them said she felt it characterized them as “emotional women who can’t take criticism.”</p>
      <p>“The brave women who used their collective voices to bring to the forefront the treatment they had endured should be applauded and not brushed off,” said the latest letter sent on Saturday. “To have 10 girls leave the team in the last week of the season should speak volumes to the magnitude of this issue, and as such, demand full attention into the seriousness of this matter.”</p>
      <p>The new message to Athletic Director Jerry S. Boyes is signed by almost half the team. Eleven members of the team quit the team and signed an initial formal complaint. They have asked not to be identified while calling in their first letter for DeMarsh, an 18-year veteran, to be fired. They cited 16 instances of “improper behavior” they say violate NCAA rules as well as the Buff State code of conduct.</p>
      <p>Among other alleged violations, the players claimed the coach singled out one for embarrassment, held personal grudges against those standing up to him, and accused a player crying in pain of being “unprofessional” and saying she needed “to keep it together.”</p>
      <p>Now they say “these legitimate concerns have been labeled as ‘perception’ by those who have reviewed the case.”</p>
      <p>“The fact that this coach and staff will remain in place after conducting themselves in this manner, and after openly telling the players at halftime of the Alfred game to ‘go ahead and complain to your parents and the athletic director about me, I will be here long after you all are gone’ is unsettling to say the least,” the players said in their latest letter.</p>

      <p>One of the women said Sunday the newest letter stands as a “second chance” for the college to take seriously their complaints.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to be blown off,” said the player, who also asked to remain unidentified while adding she hoped the matter would be “resolved internally.”</p>
      <p>Still, the players say they want DeMarsh to be held accountable.</p>
      <p>“By allowing this staff to remain it is not only tarnishing soccer careers for the players who would not tolerate it any longer,” they wrote, “but it also sets up future collegiate athletes to be subjected to the same behaviors by a coach who has been allowed to continue with nothing other than a slap on the hand.”</p>
      <p>DeMarsh said Sunday he was instructed to offer no comment. Buff State spokesman Jerod Dahlgren was unavailable.</p>
      <p>Timothy Gordon, Buff State’s vice president for student affairs, said Friday that the college was treating the complaints seriously and that reviews of the situation were underway.</p>
      <p>“The complaints shared by members of the women’s soccer program are most certainly disturbing and describe an environment that is not aligned with our institution’s values,” he said.</p>
