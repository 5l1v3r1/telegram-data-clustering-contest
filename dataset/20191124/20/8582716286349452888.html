      <p><b>JERUSALEM — </b>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accused Iran of planning attacks against the Jewish state and said everything possible would be done to prevent them.</p>
      <p>The premier, who was indicted on corruption charges on Thursday and is seen to be battling for his political life, made his remarks on a visit to an army base near the border with conflict-ravaged Syria.</p>
      <p>"Iran's aggression in our region, and against us, continues," Netanyahu said.</p>
      <p>He was speaking on the day U.S. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was in the country to meet his Israeli counterpart Aviv Kohavi.</p>
      <p>The two generals discussed "operational questions and regional developments", an army statement said.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, Netanyahu said "we are taking all necessary actions to prevent Iran from entrenching here in our region."</p>
      <p>"This includes the activity necessary to thwart the transfer of lethal weaponry from Iran to Syria, whether by air or overland.</p>
      <p>"We will also take action to thwart Iran's effort to turn Iraq and Yemen into bases for launching rockets and missiles" at Israel, he added.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, in a rare confirmation of such operations, Israel said its warplanes carried out a "very intense" attack against Iranian forces and Syrian army targets in Syria.</p>
      <p>Britain-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 23 people were killed in the strikes -- 21 fighters and two civilians.</p>
      <p>The previous day, Israel's "Iron Dome" missile defense system had intercepted four rockets fired from Syria, with the army blaming an "Iranian force".</p>
      <p>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit announced Thursday he had charged Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, prompting speculation that the end of the premier's decade-long tenure was nigh.</p>
