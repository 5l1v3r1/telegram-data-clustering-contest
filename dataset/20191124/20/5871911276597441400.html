        <i>Now that the 2019 season is over for the New York Mets, we have been looking back at the year that was. After taking a more general view of the offense, pitching, and coaching staff, it’s time to take a deeper dive into the Mets’ players. This series will take a look at every player on the roster for the Mets at the end of season from A (Pete Alonso) to Z (Daniel Zamora). The review will look at their season statistics, stories, and what role (if any) they will have next season. We continue the series today with a look at starting pitcher Marcus Stroman.</i>

        <b>2019 Stats:</b>
      </p>
      <p><i><b>Major Leagues (Toronto Blue Jays):</b></i> 21 Starts, 124.2 Innings Pitched, 6-11 Won-Loss Record, 2.96 ERA, 1.23 WHIP, 99:35 K:BB Ratio</p>
      <p><i><b>Major Leagues (New York Mets):</b></i> 11 Starts, 59.2 Innings Pitched, 4-2 Won-Loss Record, 3.77 ERA, 1.47 WHIP, 60:23 K:BB Ratio</p>
      <p><b>Story:</b> Marcus Stroman began the 2019 season with the only organization he had ever known, the Toronto Blue Jays. While the year was tough for Toronto, Stroman pitched very well, earning a trip to the All Star Game and making himself a big time trade chip in a weak starting pitching market. While most experts expected Stroman to end up with the New York Yankees, the Mets jumped the line and made a play for the righty, dealing prospects Anthony Kay and Simeon Woods-Richardson to Toronto for Stroman. The deal gave the Mets a super rotation, but Stroman struggled a bit to adjust to pitching in the National League for the first time. Stroman appeared to get in sync in September, going 3-1 with a 2.91 ERA down the stretch to help the Mets stay in the playoff hunt until the season’s final week.</p>
      <p><b>Grade:</b> B-</p>
      <p>Stroman didn’t get to do a ton with the Mets, but his acquisition was more about 2020 in the long run.</p>
      <p><b>Contract Status:</b> Arbitration Eligible (Fourth and Final Time)</p>
      <p><b>Odds of Returning:</b> 100%</p>
      <p><b>2020 Role:</b> Third Starter</p>
      <p>The Mets acquired Stroman to serve as their replacement for Zack Wheeler, who was allowed to hit free agency after declining the qualifying offer. Stroman himself is entering a contract year, so it will be interesting to see if the Mets are interested in signing him long term or if Stroman will go down the Wheeler path as well.</p>
