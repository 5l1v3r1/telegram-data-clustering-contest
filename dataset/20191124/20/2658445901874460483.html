      <h4>Oziegbe Okoeki</h4>
      <p>Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has charged leaders of religious bodies in the country, particularly Lagos, to remain peaceful and tolerant of one another despite religious and tribal differences.</p>
      <p>Sanwo-Olu gave the charge in his address to mark the “Year 2019 International Day for Tolerance,” with the theme: “Enhancing Harmonious Relationship and Peace among religious bodies for better socio-economic development in the state,” which was held in Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos.</p>
      <p>The governor said the call became necessary in view of the era of rising and violent extremism and widening conflicts that are characterised by a fundamental disregard for human life.</p>

      <p>Saying it is, however, gratifying that despite Lagos being the most cosmopolitan state that houses every tribe and religion in Nigeria, it has remained a peaceful and tolerant state in terms of religion and tribal sentiments.</p>
      <p>“This has helped our economy and invariably our socio-economic development…much as we are not taking this for granted, we have continued to create more enabling environment for more interactions among all religions in Lagos State.”</p>
      <p>In her welcome address earlier, Lagos Commissioner for Home Affairs, Mrs. Uzamat Akinbile-Yussuf, charged Lagosians to imbibe the spirit of tolerance and togetherness.</p>
      <p>According to her, tolerance was the only weapon of building peace and combating intolerance in form of racism and discrimination that too often tore societies apart, adding that the government was leaving nothing to chance to sustain and maintain the peaceful co-existence of all Lagosians.</p>
