      <h1>Haryana: New sports minister announces flying squad to monitor coaches</h1>
      <h2>Sandeep Singh, who suspended two coaches Sunday, said that good conduct will be rewarded.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:59:49+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>Haryana Minister of State for Sports and Youth Affairs (Independent charge) <a href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/sandeep-singh/">Sandeep Singh</a> on Sunday said that he has suspended two sports department coaches for being absent from duty and also ordered formation of a special flying squad to check stadiums for coaches’ conduct.</p>
      <p>Singh was in Kurukshetra for the International Gita Mahotsav Run that was organised by the Kurukshetra Development Board at Purushotampura, Brahma Sarovar on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“I don’t like that coaches come, drink tea and go back to their homes without training players. Coaches are not supposed to come according to their own timings and go home on their own timings. Such coaches are on my radar and we would form a special flying team to oversee such happenings. This team will be directly in touch with me and coaches, who are found to be absent or doing any kind of misconduct will be punished according to the law and strict action will be taken against such officials. The main work of coaches is to prepare athletes and that’s why government gives them salary. Apart from the grassroots level, I want to provide all the facilities to the professional athletes, who represent India at the international level,” Singh told mediapersons.</p>
      <p>Singh, who is a former Indian hockey captain, had won the Pehowa seat on a <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> ticket after defeating Mandeep Singh Chattha of the Congress with a margin of more than 5300 votes.</p>
      <p>The hockey player, who belongs to Shahbad, had taken oath as Minister of State earlier this month and was given Independent charge of Sports and Youth Affairs Ministry apart from Independent charge of Printing and Stationary Ministry.</p>
      <p>“I have suspended two coaches for not performing their duties and such actions will be taken against undisciplined coaches and officials too. Nurseries and stadiums are the first places, where athletes play and think of taking sports as a career and coaches cannot be absent without authorisation. Coaches, who do well and also do value addition to the athletes, will also be rewarded by the department. My focus is not on hockey only but on all the sports and we want Haryana to maintain its supremacy in the field of sports in India. Whoever indulges in indiscipline in the department has to sit at home and no such behaviour will be tolerated in the department,” said Singh.</p>
