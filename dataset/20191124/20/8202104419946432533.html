      <h3>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is sending his new top deputy west for an in-person meeting with Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, who has been among his government’s most vocal critics.</h3>
      <p>Chrystia Freeland is expected to sit down with the premier in Regina on Tuesday, less than a week after being appointed deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs.</p>
      <p>Regina Mayor Michael Fougere’s office also indicated that a meeting with Freeland has been scheduled.</p>
      <p>Fougere and Saskatoon Mayor Charlie Clark <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/pm-trudeau-to-call-mayors-clark-fougere-on-western-issues-next-week">both spoke with Trudeau last month</a>, after the prime minister signalled his intention to hear concerns and potential solutions from different levels of government.</p>
      <p>Freeland is one of three cabinet ministers with western ties tasked with soothing western anger following an election that resulted in a Liberal minority with no representation in Saskatchewan and Alberta.</p>
      <p>“The Premier has had a positive working relationship with Minister Freeland, and he looks forward to discussing issues that are facing our province,” said Moe’s press secretary, Jim Billington.</p>
      <p>Alex Lawrence, a spokesman for Freeland, confirmed the meeting with Moe on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Freeland’s first trip west as deputy prime minister comes days after Moe returned from a post-election meeting with Trudeau in Ottawa during which he pushed his “new deal for Canada agenda.”</p>
      <p>Moe called that meeting “<a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/politics/scott-moe-disappointed-to-hear-nothing-new-from-prime-minister-trudeau-at-meeting">disappointing</a>,” and said Trudeau made no commitments on his priorities: a pause on the federal carbon tax, equalization reform and better market access for the province’s commodities.</p>
      <p>Ottawa subsequently offered a different account of the meeting. A federal official with knowledge of it told Postmedia that Trudeau came in with an open mind and Moe brought little to the table.</p>
      <p>Moe has said he has a “fairly strong relationship” with Freeland, who previously served as foreign affairs minister, but offered a more tepid assessment of Trudeau’s new cabinet.</p>
      <p>“It’s not about the people that are around the table; it’s about the decisions,” he said.</p>
