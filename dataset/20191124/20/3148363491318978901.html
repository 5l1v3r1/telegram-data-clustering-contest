      <p>The tragic incident <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-queensboro-plaza-subway-death-20191124-xhkubil6wvgnlcycej4j26mc3m-story.html">happened</a> around 8:45 p.m. on Saturday when he fell from the outside of a Manhattan-bound No. 7 train, according to the <i>New York Daily News. </i></p>
      <p>Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) motormen <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/11/23/subway-surfer-queens-killed-mta/">found</a> the teen’s body lying about 20 feet beyond the Queensboro Plaza station. He was pronounced dead at the scene, CBS New York reported.</p>
      <p>Police said the youth, who was believed to be just 14 years of age, appeared to have hit his head on a piece of metal hanging over the tracks.</p>
      <p>The New York City Transit Authority issued a statement via Twitter following the incident.</p>

      <p>In the past, MTA officials have urged people not to engage in the dangerous and illegal activity.</p>
      <p>“This is stupid, it’s dangerous, it’s selfish, and it’s got to stop,” <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/05/23/search-for-suspect-pulling-subway-brakes/">said</a> New York City Transit Authority President Andy Byford during a board meeting in May.</p>
      <p>Byford said the suspects escape authorities by jumping from the tracks and onto other trains.</p>
      <p>“It’s very selfish for them to do this, because the repercussion for those of us who are delayed, especially if we have to get somewhere, is unfortunate,” one meeting attendee said.</p>
      <p>However, the New York Police Department (NYPD) stated during the May event that it would deploy more officers to subway stations as part of a “broader plan” to stop the criminal activity from happening.</p>
      <p>“The increase will allow them to physically be on the trains and to hopefully catch a suspect in the act or at least make the person or group responsible think twice,” CBS New York reported.</p>
      <p>A teenager who reportedly knew the young man that died said, “It’s my fault. I always go up with him when he asks me. I should have told him no.”</p>
      <p>Subway surfing has been an ongoing problem that takes place at least once every day in New York City.</p>
