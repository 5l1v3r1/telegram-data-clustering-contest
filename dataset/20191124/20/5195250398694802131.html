      <h3>Renault launched a facelift for its entry-segment crossover Kwid last month. Looking to buy one and want to know more about it? Take a read</h3>
      <p>The Kwid was originally launched back in 2015, and Renault continued to sell the entry-segment car with no major updates since then. However, the French carmaker has spiced things up a little in the segment with the recently launched Kwid facelift.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here are the 5 things that will probably answer all your questions about the 2019 Renault Kwid facelift –</b>
      </p>
      <h4>1. Dimensions</h4>
      <p>In terms of size, the Kwid measures 3,731 mm in length, 1,579 mm in width, and stands 1,474 mm tall. It has a 2,422 mm wheelbase, and a 184 mm ground clearance, which means you can ease your mind even on bad roads.</p>
      <h4>2. Exterior and Interior Styling</h4>
      <p>Design-wise, the Kwid does not feel like an entry-segment car at all. The car poses like an SUV, and has a high bonnet to give it a beefy appearance. Externally, the Kwid gets a split headlamp design with LED DRLs at the front, plastic body cladding on the sides along with roof rails, and a faux skid plate at the rear, along with LED tail lamps. The car also features 14-inch wheels which makes it look well proportioned.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Inside the cabin, the Kwid features a dual-tone scheme. The dash features the car’s lettering, while the gear selector sits right in between the front seats. A touchscreen infotainment unit is also seen, which is borrowed from its sibling, the Triber.</p>
      <h4>3. Drivetrains</h4>
      <p>Renault has equipped the Kwid with two BS4-compliant three-cylinder petrol engines, which are a 0.8-litre unit, and a bigger 1.0-litre unit. The former makes 54 PS of max torque, and 72 Nm of max torque, whereas the latter puts out 68 PS/91 Nm. The car is offered with a 5-speed manual transmission as standard, and an optional AMT.</p>

      <p>A test-mule of what could possibly be the BS6-compliant version of the Renault Kwid was also spied recently with camouflage, which indicates that the French carmaker could introduce it in the market soon.</p>
      <h4>4. Features and Safety</h4>
      <p>The 2019 Kwid gets an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system integrated with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. In addition to that, it gets a rear armrest, a reverse parking camera with guidelines, remote keyless entry and an LED Digital MID.</p>
