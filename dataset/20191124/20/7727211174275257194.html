      <h2>LFC Stories: A look at the career of Jordan Henderson at Liverpool</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ryan Baldi</a></address>
      <p>For the briefest, sweetest instant, the doubting voices fade. Jordan Henderson, the most measured of men, has given himself over to the moment. His knuckles whiten, so tight is his grip around the European Cup. He raises club football’s most iconic prize high above his head. Locking his arms out straight, his eyes close and his mouth gapes wide as he lets out a roar of pure elation. His team-mates bounce behind him, arm in arm, as fireworks explode and confetti falls over the pitch upon which their triumph was sealed.</p>
      <p>Liverpool’s comfortable Champions League final victory over Tottenham in Madrid has added Henderson’s name to a list of European Cup-winning captains that includes such luminaries as Johan Cruyff, Franz Beckenbauer and Paolo Maldini, Emlyn Hughes, Graeme Souness and Steven Gerrard.</p>
      <p>Henderson is under no pretension that he matches these giants of football’s past in talent or historical significance. And when Liverpool’s celebrations ebb and the confetti is swept from the Wanda Metropolitano turf, the disbelievers will be no more convinced of his abilities than before. He may not ever change their minds, but he will never stop striving to prove them wrong. As he feels the cold silver warming in his hands, a small part of the satisfaction pouring over him surely emanates from having defeated his doubters, even if they can’t be won over.</p>
      <p>There are few players over whom opinion is divided as starkly and vociferously as Henderson, even among fans of the club he captains. Some believe him to be crucial to Liverpool’s emergence as title challengers under Jurgen Klopp, and vital too to their prospects of a first top-flight crown in three decades, praising his leadership, calm assuredness and reliability on the ball.</p>
      <p>Others question his place among the Reds’ first-choice midfield trio, let alone his captaincy, feeling he is neither an adequate protector of the backline when fielded in a deep position, nor penetrative enough in his preferred box-to-box-role.</p>
      <p>Debate rages, but it does not distract Henderson or shake his focus. He has, after all, faced doubts for most of his career. Sir Alex Ferguson famously aimed a spiteful barb in the Liverpool midfielder’s direction in 2013, writing in his autobiography that Manchester United had considered signing Henderson from Sunderland as a youngster, but elected against any move, citing bizarre concerns over his running style. “Henderson runs with his knees, with a straight back, while the modern footballer runs from his hips,” Ferguson said. “We thought his gait might cause him problems later in his career.”</p>
      <p>Arriving at Anfield in the same transfer window as Stewart Downing, Charlie Adam and goalkeeper Doni, in the summer of 2011, Henderson’s £16m signing was part of a spending spree widely derided. And when Brendan Rodgers wanted to sign Clint Dempsey from Fulham a year later, Henderson was discussed as a potential makeweight, with only the player’s refusal to join the London club scuppering the deal.</p>
      <p>Through it all, though, Henderson’s determination sustained him.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool captain was recently a guest on Jamie Carragher’s <i>Greatest Games</i> podcast, and he told a story from his days as a youngster with Sunderland which gave an insight into the mentality that has propelled his career.</p>
      <p>Sunderland’s reserves had returned to the dressing room after a shambolic performance in defeat, and they were greeted by an irate Roy Keane, the club’s first-team manager at the time. A teenage Henderson, yet to make his senior debut, was among the starters in the second string that day. Keane turned to the young midfielder, glaring, and asked him whether, on the evidence of that game’s showing, he believed himself to be good enough to play for Sunderland. Without hesitation, Henderson looked his volatile, intimidating manager in the eye and replied that, yes, he knew he was good enough. Impressed by the youngster’s pluck and self-confidence, Keane soon promoted Henderson to the first team.</p>
      <p>Similar questions were asked by fans, critics and even his own team-mates during Henderson’s first season at Liverpool. Struggling to establish himself in Rodgers’ line-up and, at times, falling short of the expected standards set by Luis Suarez and others in training, retaining confidence was a battle. But he never shrunk, and he fought doggedly to earn the respect of his peers and a place in the team.</p>
      <p>“He rebelled against the critics,” Suarez said. “Maybe they brought out a bit of his character that we didn’t know he had.”</p>
      <p>Criticism of Henderson’s technical ability is often inordinate, but it is not baseless. He has his share of weaknesses. His passing can be unambitious and he doesn’t always move the ball as quickly as is necessary in Jurgen Klopp’s system. And, when operating as the deepest central midfielder, his defensive positioning in not as precise or natural as Fabinho’s.</p>
      <p>But Henderson brings much more to the plate than he is credited for. He is indefatigable, tenacious in pursuit of his given task and a sound technician. When released to attack, he can surprise with his underrated crossing ability, knack for thrusting forward runs and application to Liverpool’s counter-pressing.</p>
      <p>His playing style is the embodiment of the rigid defiance that underpins his character. He moves with tension. He stomps where others flow, he scurries and stabs where others glide and weave. These are neither strengths nor weaknesses, rather idiosyncrasies that, in the right moment, deployed in the right role, make him uniquely effective.</p>
      <p>Henderson is also the consummate team player. He has often been asked to operate in positions not best suited to his skill set, yet he learns on the job and finds ways to bend his style to what is required. And there are times when Liverpool’s captain is not selected for important fixtures – such as the first leg of last season’s Champions League semi-final against Barcelona – but he doesn’t sulk or allow a bruised ego to negatively impact the dressing-room harmony. Although hurt and disappointed to be left out, he redoubles his quiet resolve in hope of not being overlooked again.</p>
      <p>Handed the Liverpool captaincy upon Steven Gerrard’s departure for Los Angeles Galaxy in 2015, Henderson has grown into the role of team spokesman and leader. He has learned when and how to speak up, deliver commands and stir his colleagues, and, leading by example, his effort levels never for a second dip below the maximum.</p>
      <p>“Jordan was one of the Liverpool players I cared about most,” said Gerrard, who has remained in contact with Henderson since leaving the club, on hand to dispense advise whenever it is sought. “I’d always had a good feeling that he would become a vital player for the club and the country. I liked him, and I could see a lot of myself in him.”</p>
      <p>Some assessments of Henderson’s shortcomings are so deeply entrenched that anything approaching unanimous acceptance is unlikely. And the truth about his ability probably rests somewhere in the middle of the polarised debate. But there is a reason why Klopp, Gareth Southgate, Gerrard and even Keane have long had unflappable faith in the Liverpool captain. The years spent defying doubters have calcified his will. Henderson’s unbreakable spirit makes him someone you want on your side.</p>
