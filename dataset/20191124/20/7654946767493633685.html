      <h1>Second arrest made over UFC star’s missing stepdaughter Aniah Blanchard</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T20:27:04+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 20:27</time> by <a rel="author">Lee Brown</a></address>
      <p>A second man has been charged with <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/27/ufc-fighters-stepdaughter-reported-missing-car-recovered/">kidnapping Aniah Blanchard</a>, the missing 19-year-old stepdaughter of UFC heavyweight Walt Harris, police have confirmed.</p>
      <p>Antwain “Squirmy” Shamar Fisher, 35, was arrested in Alabama on Friday on a warrant charging him with first-degree kidnapping of the missing teen, authorities <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2019/11/23/aniah-blanchard-update-antwain-fisher-kidnapping-ibraheem-yazeed-auburn-montgomery-squirmy/4282463002/">told the Montgomery Advertiser</a>.</p>
      <p>He was busted by Auburn police aided by members of the U.S. Marshal’s Task Force, the paper stated. He is now being held in Alabama’s Lee County Detention Center.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear what role he may have played, and a gag order prevents attorneys and prosecutors from speaking about the case, the paper said.</p>
      <p>He was the second arrest in the case, with Ibraheem Yazeed <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/08/aniah-blanchard-missing-man-charged-in-disappearance-of-ufc-fighters-stepdaughter/">charged with first-degree kidnapping </a>earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Yazeed was allegedly <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/07/cops-hunt-for-person-of-interest-in-disappearance-of-ufc-fighter-walt-harris-stepdaughter/">captured on surveillance video</a> at the same Auburn convenience store where Blanchard was last seen on Oct. 23, officials said, with them always predicting further arrests.</p>
      <p>Her car was later found with blood, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/blood-of-ufc-stars-missing-stepdaughter-aniah-blanchard-found-inside-car/">suggesting “a life-threatening injury,”</a> authorities have previously revealed. Her whereabouts remain unknown.</p>
