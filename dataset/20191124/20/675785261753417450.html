      <h2>Claudia Ruf, from Grevenbroich west Germany was kidnapped, raped and then choked to death in 1996</h2>

      <p>Police have requested DNA samples from 900 men to help them crack a horrific rape and murder case from 25 years ago.</p>
      <p>Claudia Ruf, from Grevenbroich west Germany, was kidnapped in 1996 and her charred body was found in Euskirchen, 43 miles south of her home city two days later, with DNA traces of her killer on it.</p>
      <p>Her murder has baffled police, and now as part of a new probe they are asking the men, who would have been aged between 14 and 70 at the time of the youngster's killing, to have a saliva swab test.</p>
      <p>Investigators said all 900 men are not suspects and have invited them to come to testing at a local elementary school this and next weekend, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7720353/900-men-Germany-asked-DNA-samples-solve-violent-murder-11-year-old-girl-1996.html">Mail Online reported.</a></p>
      <p>The Rheinische Post reported the first of the men were already lining up outside the school at 10am Saturday.</p>

      <p>In 2010 police tested 350 men's DNA in the area, but got no matches, but they have now found evidence to suggest checking another 900 men could help them find Claudia's killer.</p>
      <p>Police have not confirmed if the 350 men are to be included in the new round of DNA tests.</p>
      <p>Claudia was kidnapped in May 1996 when she went for a walk with her neighbor's dog and her remains were found on a path in the fields near Euskirchen after it has been doused with petrol and burned.</p>
      <p>There have been several appeals to find her including one on German TV this year.</p>
      <p>Claudia's father Friedhelm Ruf asked people for help solving the death of his daughter in a widely shared video this month.</p>
      <p>He said: "After more than 23 years, there's a big possibility to solve the sad fate of my daughter.</p>
      <p>"The perpetrator has been able for too long to hide behind all of us."</p>
