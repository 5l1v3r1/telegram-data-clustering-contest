          <p>The Ford Trophy makes a return to the New Zealand cricketing fraternity for its latest round of fixtures on Sunday with three matches slated for the day. And one of them sees Auckland Aces who are currently occupying a position in the pinnacles of the points tally square off against Wellington Firebirds in a match which looks set to revel us in a piquant brand of cricket.</p>
          <p>The only side to have won both of their encounters in the showpiece one day tournamnet in the domestic circuit of the country, Auckland Aces have fully lived upto the stanch aspirations being levelled on their head. The side are laden with a slew of worldclass performers, names who are involved with New Zealand’s cricket side as well, integral fulcrums of their rampant ascendancy in the league.</p>

                <p>The previous win over Central District Stags perfectly encapsulated the aforementioned gripping narrative as the side navigated their way to a colossal 100 run win on the day. Making 721 while batting first, the side returned with a pinch perfect bowling display, one which left their opponents in disarray and bewilderment as they managed to totter their way to a haywire 171.</p>
                <p>Elsewhere, Wellington Firebirds managed to register their first win as well after being downed in their tournamnet opener as they went onto putdown Otego Volts with five wickets to spare. The 230 successful run chase came with over  overs to spare, a performance which epitomised the electric and quirky calibre prevelant in this outfit.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>A solid wicket for the batters awaits us today with the conditions prevelant over here being extremely conducive for batting. The morning conditions will offer assistance to the quicks leading the side winning the toss choosing to chase here one a wicket which will be quick to settle down and see batsmen cream the ball to the short boundaries.</p>

                            <h3>WEL Vs AUK Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>With 2,632 runs in the domestic arena, Devin Conway was in pristine touch in the last outing for Wellington firebirds as he hit a match winning knock to see them peel down the target at hand with ease to make the player our choice for this docket of our Dream 11 side.</p>
                            <h3>WEL Vs AUK Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>Auckland Aces’ openers, Martin Guptill and Colin Munro have yet to immerse us in the scintillating ad alluring displays they are alluded for but the august identity the two players hold mean they were always to be imbedded into the setup of our unit. One of the oldest campaigners in hs country, Guptill has amassed a staggering 6,626 runs in 176 matches where Munro has 1,271 in 53 ODIs to make both of them an instant pick for us.</p>
                            <p>From the other side of the docket meanwhile we are moving in with Robert O’Donnell with the player being one of their most consistent names in the opening two matches, a player who has persistently held fort from one end.</p>
                            <h3>WEL Vs AUK Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Heavily composed of players from Wellington Firebirds, we are moving in with a barrage of players from the side with a trio of picks from the unit with Neesham being the first player to be ingrained into our Dream 11 setup. The player is yet to pile on immense runs but he’s enjoying the most judicious and jubilant year of his career, one where he’s immensely impressed with both the bat and ball to make him an instant choice for us.</p>
                            <p>Opener left hand spinner Rachin Ravindra comes bearing with him the pinch perfect identity of the ideal all-rounder we go scouring for to see us indulge in him as well alongside Malcom Nofal while from the opposition we are completing our unit with the pick of Sean Solia.</p>
                            <h3>WEL Vs AUK Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>We have to begin this docket with Lockie Ferguson. The player has grown immensely in stature to become a frontline spearhead of New Zealand’s bowling unit, a player who is at the forefront of his team’s bowling unit. We have cramp batsmen for room on any surface, a name who is bound to make early inroads to see us rope him in for the day.</p>
                            <p>William Somerville and Ben Lister come in as well for us from Auckland Aces, two players who make for a seamless blend of function and grace given the kind of rippers and deviations they have sent down in the last couple of encounters.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Solia will be captaining our side out for the day while Lister is being made our vice-captain.</p>
