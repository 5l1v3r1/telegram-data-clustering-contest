      <p>Tonight's "<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-schedule-2019-monday-sunday-thursday-night-football-tv-channels/e2smds4hyeex10dl3racx2auo">Sunday Night Football</a>" game is about as big as they come in terms of regular-season NFL matchups. The 49ers, hosting the Packers in a game scheduled to kick off at 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC, are three-point home favorites. That means the game that will give one team the inside track to the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs is essentially a toss-up.</p>
      <p>The 49ers, entering <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-schedule-week-12-games-today-tv-channels-times-scores/gxmnxkzzjcap1ay36iwj8ukpw">Week 12</a> with the NFC's best record at 9-1, are facing the 8-2 Packers. According to the NFL, it marks just the fifth time since 2007 that teams with two or fewer losses have played each other this late in a season. The winners of the last two such games — the Broncos in 2015 and the Seahawks in 2013 — went on to win Super Bowls at the end of those seasons.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In every season since the NFL expanded to 32 teams and realigned into eight divisions in 2002, at least one team has won its division the season after missing the playoffs. After both missed the playoffs in 2018, the 49ers and Packers currently stand as the top two seeds in the NFC, lead their respective divisions through 10 games and are positioned to continue that trend.</p>
      <p>With a win over Green Bay, San Francisco, which finished 4-12 last season,would join the 2016 Cowboys as the only teams to win 10 of their first 11 games in a season after winning four or fewer games the previous year in NFL history.</p>
      <p>Below is all the info you need to watch <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/49ers-packers-channel-schedule-time-sunday-night-football-game/159pzkdm2dgj91hti3schuesgs">49ers vs. Packers</a> on Sunday night, including the TV channels and kickoff time.</p>
      <h3>Who plays on Sunday Night Football tonight?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Matchup</b>: Green Bay Packers at San Francisco 49ers</li>
        <li><b>Kickoff time</b>: 8:20 p.m. ET</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Inour Week 12NFL picks against the spread and straight-up predictions, Sporting News is split on Sunday night's game. Below are the explanations for each pick.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/list/week-12-nfl-picks-against-the-spread/1tjq0ocrnmrlb1hzigphiidlly">Pick against the spread</a>:The Packers will have Aaron Rodgers and Aaron Jones coming off a bye to attack a 49ers defense that has shown more vulnerability against offenses with athletic quarterbacks and quick backs. But Green Bay hasn't played the run well all season, and the diversity and versatility of San Francisco playing off that strength will be difficult to defend. The 49ers have more viable weapons among their backs, wideouts and tight ends for Jimmy Garoppolo than Matt LaFleur can effectively deploy for Rodgers on the road. In this big game under the spotlight, the Niners will barely have the Packers' number. <i>Pick: 49ers win 30-27 and cover the spread</i>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/list/week-12-nfl-picks-predictions/1o5rmt44twusm1xkrsyqxe4efs">Straight-up prediction</a>:This is a big one for the NFC playoff picture. Should the 49ers lose to the Packers and give up the inside track to the No. 1 seed, they would be in trouble given their tough schedule over the next few weeks. San Francisco, which up to this point has taken advantage of a relatively light schedule, looks better than Green Bay statistically, but Aaron Rodgers and Co. are coming off a bye completely healthy. The 49ers' pass rush will make it challenging, but Rodgers will outplay Jimmy Garoppolo on the national stage. <i>Pick: Packers 24, 49ers 20</i>.</p>
