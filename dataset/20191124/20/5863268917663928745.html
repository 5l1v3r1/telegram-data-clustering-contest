      <p>Prime Minister Imran Khan said an effective and comprehensive strategy should be evolved with the cooperation of the provincial governments to overcome inflation and unemployment in the country and to transfer dividends of improved economic indicators to the people.</p>
      <p>Firdous Ashiq Awan informed that the committee also presented various proposals regarding industrialization, ease of doing business, and revamping economy of the country. She said short and long term economic policies also came under discussion during the meeting.</p>
      <p>Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan said the committee also decided to apprise the people about mega projects completed by the PTI Government.<br/>She said the party has authorized Prime Minister Imran Khan to implement his strategies to ensure good governance in the country.</p>
      <p>She said Imran Khan has directed to complete restructuring of the party on emergency basis to strengthen local bodies system and this process should be finalized before local governments  elections.</p>
