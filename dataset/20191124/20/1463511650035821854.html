      <p>The Edo Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, has said that the state has a formidable and corruption-free judiciary.</p>
      <p>Shaibu stated this at a reception organised in honour of the newly sworn-in state Chief Judge, Justice Esther Edigin on Sunday in Benin.</p>
      <p>According to him, it is a thing of joy that the transition in the judiciary is seamless and without any hassle.</p>
      <p>“Talking more seriously, we have a formidable and corruption-free judiciary system in the state. The Edo judiciary has never been mentioned in any corruption case.</p>
      <p>“As you assume office, our joy is that the judiciary will be better than you met it.</p>
      <p>“I watched your predecessor during her speech; I saw the joy of a fulfilled mother, like these my children that I left behind have kept the fire burning and the light is still shining,” he said.</p>
      <p>The deputy governor prayed God to give the new CJ the grace to take right decisions, especially at critical situations, and succeed in the assignment. </p>
