      <h3>When did Caitlyn and Sophia meet?</h3>
      <p>The pair first met in 2015 through their make-up artist and hairstylist.</p>
      <p>Sophia – who is also a transgendered woman – was just starting her transition at the time.</p>
      <p>She revealed her decision to transition in her school newspaper in 2016, and, according to reports in The Mirror, said Caitlyn had inspired her to do it.</p>

      <p>Speaking with podcast The Hidden Truth in October 2018, Sophia opened up about her relationship with Caitlyn, saying she ‘wouldn’t describe it as a romantic relationship.’</p>
      <p>But she did elaborate to say: ‘We’re partners in everything we do, we’re inseparable, we’re business partners, we live together, we share a dog, we share family, we share a life together.’</p>
      <p>Sounds pretty close, and she’s close enough to be in charge of Caitlyn’s social media.</p>
      <p>Sharing a sweet snap of them together on Instagram, Sophia posted: ‘Hey guys it’s @hutchins_sophia While @caitlynjenner is in the jungle for @imacelebrity we are all rooting her on here in the USA!! Go CAITLYN!!’</p>
