      <h1>PNP notes crime as quality of life indicator</h1>

      <h3>LESSER  crime and lesser fear of crime owing to the police’s stepped-up patrols and other massive strategy to arrest all forms of criminality in the streets have contributed significantly to improved quality of life of Filipinos, Philippine National Police Officer-in-Charge, Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa told the Journal Group yesterday.</h3>
      <p>The PNP-OIC also maintained that crime in the Philippines “has remained on a downtrend,” and that the Duterte government is winning the war on illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>Amid the government’s war on drugs, the PNP leadership said it has effectively ‘sustained the decline in the crime rate’  as they intensified operations particularly against such crimes as murder, homicide, physical injury, rape, robbery and theft.</p>
      <p>Police have bared that over the past three years, “crime incidents continually decreased.”</p>
      <p>From more than 626,000 from July 2015 to June 2016, the PNP said the total crime volume in the country decreased by 58,276 or 9.30 percent during the first year of President Duterte’s term covering the period July 2016 to June 2017.</p>
      <p>This further decreased by 79,647 incidents or 14.02 percent on the second year covering the period July 2017 to June 2018, and further went down by 2.91 percent on the third year covering the period July 2018 to June 2019.</p>
      <p>The PNP-OIC gave the assessment  as he noted the correlation between crime and quality of life based on results of a recent Social Weather Station (SWS) survey that showed roughly a third of the population or 36 percent of Filipinos expressing improved quality of life.</p>
      <p>The SWS survey conducted on Sept. 27 to 30, 2019 indicate 36 percent of Filipinos said their lives improved over the past 12 months.</p>
      <p>The same survey found that 46 percent of adults expect that their quality of life will improve in the next 12 months while only five percent  expect their quality of life will worsen.</p>
      <p>“This feeling of improved quality of life is fairly consistent with PNP data that showed improved crime situation over time,” Gamboa said citing the 4.89 percent drop in nationwide Crime Volume or some 6,000 fewer crime incidents during the third quarter of 2019 as compared with same period in 2018.</p>
      <p>“This data validates our assumption that people appreciate improved quality of life in a safer environment where there is less crime and less fear of crime,” the official explained.</p>
      <p>According to the PNP-OIC, their 3rd quarter crime data showed significant decreases among crimes against person and crimes against property in most crime categories such as murder, homicide, physical injury, robbery, theft, and carnapping, except rape that rose 3.47 percent from July to  September this year.</p>
      <p>Gamboa said all these index crime cases, except rape, dropped steadily in the 3rd quarter of 2019, with carnapping posting the sharpest decline at 45.86 percent and theft cases going down further by 13.84 percent.</p>
      <p>Murder cases likewise decreased by 9.81 percent, homicide by 11.90 percent and robbery by 4.52 percent, he said.</p>
      <p>Gen. Gamboa said that crime solution and crime clearance efficiency ratings were consistently posted at double-digits figures in the 3rd quarter, indicating the PNP’s capacity to solve and clear criminal cases.</p>
      <p>Philippine National Police spokesman, Brigadier General Bernard M. Banac said  the total crime volume was reported by the PNP Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management which is tasked to validate all crime incidents being reported to the PNP national headquarters.</p>
      <p>Banac also said that crime volume nationwide also decreased to 115,539 during the 1st quarter of the year—or 3,963 incidents less—compared to the 119,502 crimes recorded during the same period in 2019.</p>
      <p>“Ma-attribute natin ito sa intensified campaign on illegal drugs. Ayun pa rin talaga. We can safely say that because of the intensified campaign on illegal drugs, criminals are staying away from committing crimes lalo na yung involved sa droga. Kasi kapag under the influence of illegal drugs ang isang tao, may tendency talaga na gumawa ng krimen  pero dahil na-reduce natin ‘yung paggamit ng droga , bumaba din ang krimen,” the PNP spokesperson said.<br/>    </p>
