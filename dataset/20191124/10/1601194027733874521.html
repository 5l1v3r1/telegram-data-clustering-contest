      <h4>Triple H on why SAnitY broke up</h4>
      <p>SAnitY were called up to the main roster during the 2018 Superstar Shake-Up. Despite being a popular act in NXT, the faction failed to have any impact on the main roster, and being called up without Nikki Cross didn't help. Their appearances on WWE television grew fewer and further apart until they were officially disbanded.</p>
      <p>Triple H addressed the SAnitY situation during his interview after NXT TakeOver: WarGames.Triple H said that the faction didn't click and fell apart from the inside which led to WWE splitting them up.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Rhea Ripley joined Triple H during the media call and revealed the women's NXT team for Survivor Series tonight. Ripley will be joined by Bianca Belair, Io Shirai, Toni Storm and Candice LeRae.</p>
