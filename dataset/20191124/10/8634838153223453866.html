      <p>"Today, I lost the woman who raised me. My nanny <i>Ndeta</i>, the woman who has wiped my tears so many times and taught me to be strong.</p>
      <p>"Heartbroken and humbled at having shared my life with such an amazing human being. RIP Ndeta," stated Muli.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear what caused the deceased's death since the anchor declined to comment on the matter.</p>
      <p>In April, another <i>Citizen TV</i> staffer, <i>Rauka</i> host Kambua Manundu, <a href="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/45369-joho-painfully-narrates-losing-his-mother-cancer-video">mourned the tragic death of her grandmother</a>.</p>
      <p>Her grandmother's death came in the same month as her father professor Manundu anniversary. He passed away on April 9, 2014, after battling illness for a long time.</p>
      <p>"People I love seem to find their angel wings in April. <i>Koma nesa sûsû wakwa</i> (Sleep well, grandma). 15.04.2019,” she posted on Twitter at the time.</p>
      <p>Professor Manundu was known for his proprietorship at Manundu Herbal clinics.</p>
