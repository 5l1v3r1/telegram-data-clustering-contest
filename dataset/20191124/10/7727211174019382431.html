      <h1>Southport General Election campaign: a three-way battle for electoral supremacy by the sea</h1>
      <h2>Sea, sand and swing voting in Merseyside's most intriguing seat</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:17:02+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/liam-thorp/" target="_blank">Liam Thorp</a></address>
      <p>When it comes to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a> on Merseyside - <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> is where the drama is.</p>
      <p>While many seats across our region will undoubtedly stay the same colour they have over the years, this is a seat where a number of narratives could play out - and a number of parties are very much in play.</p>
      <p>Between 1997 and 2017 the seaside seat was comfortably held by the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>, with veteran local figure <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/john-pugh">John Pugh</a> in office for the vast majority of those twenty years.</p>
      <p>But at the last <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a> the electoral tectonic plates in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> shifted dramatically, with the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/conservative-party">Tory candidate</a> taking the seat and an impressive <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> performance knocking the once dominant <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Lib Dems</a> down into a lowly third.</p>

      <p>Liz Savage took Labour's vote share from 19% to 32% as Labour enjoyed surprisingly good results across the board.</p>
      <p>But this isn't 2017 and the political outlook is very different now.</p>
      <p>While the Lib Dems were still suffering hugely from their time in coalition with the Conservatives in 2017 - they have reinvented themselves as the party of remaining in the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/european-union">European Union</a> with a new leader and some impressive results in local and European elections.</p>
      <p>But Labour have been doing well locally in recent times.</p>

      <p>Before 2018 the party had never had an elected councillor in the Lib Dem-dominated <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> area, now they have five.</p>
      <p>And of course Conservative Damien Moore is now the incumbent and is a member of a party that is clearly ahead in the polls.</p>
      <p>His case has been helped further by the withdrawal of the Brexit Party candidate following Nigel Farage's decision to withdraw any candidates that were at risk of splitting the Leave vote.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the Greens have also refused to enter a candidate and have thrown their backing behind the Lib Dems in a town that, based on projections, did vote to remain in the 2016 referendum.</p>
      <p>So tactical voting is clearly a major factor in this fascinating three-way battle, but what are the other issues facing Southport and why do the three candidates believe they are best place to deal with them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Damien Moore - Conservative</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mr Moore, a former Preston city councillor, was perhaps a surprise victor in 2017 - but he will go into <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/general-election">this election</a> in a strong position to retain his seat.</p>
      <p>He believes his strong Brexit stance and work on local issues will see him home.</p>
      <p>He said: "We are at a critical moment in our great nation’s history.</p>
      <p>"Our country needs decisive leadership and the strength of character to build a more prosperous outward-looking nation. And our town needs a positive long-term plan to continue to overcome the obstacles it has faced.</p>
      <p>"That’s why I am standing to be re-elected as Southport's <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/conservative-party">Conservative</a> Member of Parliament."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Speaking to constituents, he added: "As your MP, I have remained absolutely clear on Brexit throughout this process.</p>
      <p>"Keeping no-deal on the table strengthens the Government’s position but leaving with a good deal is far more preferable, not just for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> but the country as a whole. And we need to respect the result of the referendum."</p>
      <p>He claimed Labour and the Lib Dems have tried to 'frustrate the will of the British people', adding: "All they offer is five more years of dithering and division."</p>
      <p>Locally, he says he wants to 'build on our recent success and rejuvenate Southport.'</p>

        <figcaption>Conservative candidate Damien Moore</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He added: "Despite poor decision making by both Labour and Liberal Democrats locally, I have ensured that <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> is better off.</p>
      <p>"In December, the Southport to Manchester Piccadilly rail service will return, helping residents to commute and our tourist economy recover.</p>
      <p>"The A and E at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport Hospital</a> has seen an expansion thanks to a £1.25 million investment I secured from the Health Secretary.</p>
      <p>"And our high-streets have been handed a £25 million lifeline after my campaign to rejuvenate <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport’s economy</a> was successful.</p>
      <p>"But I won’t stop there. I will continue to work hard for you and your family, ensuring <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> receives the attention it deserves."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Liz Savage - Labour</b>
      </p>

        <figcaption>Southport Labour Parliamentary candidate Liz Savage</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Much like Labour's national argument - <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour candidate</a> Liz Savage says her plan for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> is all about investment.</p>
      <p>She said: "Investment in local services so that <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> families will know that their hospital is safe and secure, with its services improving.</p>
      <p>"Then there are our plans for a National Care Service and free personal care - our plans to give local authorities real funding to ensure an improvement in local services that will see our roads repaired, make sure our streets are safe and clean and much more.</p>
      <p>"We will make an investment in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> and its future - bringing real funding and regeneration to our town and villages which for nearly a decade have been blighted by Lib Dem and Tory cuts.</p>
      <p>"Helped by Labour's multi-point plan to rebuild our high streets by tackling real problems such as unfair Tory business rates, we can look at repurposing empty properties and revitalising our town centre so it can adapt to current trends and challenges."</p>
      <p>Ms Savage said she brings a 'long and real record of campaigning on local issues for local people' to the table.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article14116185.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/JS40844981.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>She added: "From fighting for our hospital and improving its services, which got the backing of the local NHS trust chief, to helping save a local park or helping get car parking charges reduced and lots more issues besides - I've worked for years on local issues and with local people for the benefit of our community here and am working with prominent business people and political leaders to revitalise the town."</p>
      <p>Hitting out at Mr Moore's record, she added: "Contrast that with the Conservative candidate who as MP wildly boasted he'd secured £675m in funding and <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> would benefit but it was pure fantasy and Southport never saw a penny.</p>
      <p>"Now he's trying it on again claiming he's secured £25m - though it's actually only an opportunity for the council to bid for funding of up to £25m but with no guarantee of anything. "</p>
      <p>Ms Savage knows she faces a major threat that the Lib Dems could split the remain/remain-leaning vote and she claimed the battle is now only between red and blue.</p>
      <p>She said: "Labour came a strong second in Southport in 2017 and the Lib Dems also lost five council seats to us since.</p>
      <p>"Even the Tories now admit it's between us and them.</p>
      <p>"I'd say to Southport residents who want to oust the Tories - do you really want to chance putting them back in and getting their awful Brexit deal by voting for anyone else but Labour here? We will bring real change - and Southport desperately needs it after being on the Lib Dem /Tory treadmill getting us nowhere for far too long."</p>

        <b>John Wright - Liberal Democrats</b>
      </p>

        <figcaption>John Wright, the Liberal Democrat candidate for Southport</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The idea that this is just a two horse race is one that <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrat</a> candidate John Wright will be keen to banish quickly.</p>
      <p>He believes people miss the presence of the party since 2017.</p>
      <p>He said: "People in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> know that when you elect a Liberal Democrat MP you will get someone who is honest, hardworking, and in touch with the local community, an MP who will be there for you when you need them.</p>
      <p>"Since <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/john-pugh">John Pugh</a> stepped down in 2017, many people have told us they miss having an MP who is accessible to all the community.</p>
      <p>"Locally, we need an MP who will address the most important issues facing us, especially working for the revitalisation of our town centre, and ensuring that Southport Hospital’s future is safe.</p>
      <p>"Nationally, we need a party in government committed to ending austerity and supporting major investment in our NHS, GP services, social care, schools, police, and council services. That’s the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>."</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article15905864.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Southport-seafront-with-its-Pier-and-Promenade-Photo-by-Colin-Lane.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>He added: "We share the concern of Southport residents about the climate emergency; the Liberal Democrats will spend £100 billion over the next five years to address this."</p>
      <p>And on the big issue of the day?</p>
      <p>Mr Wright said: "Southport voted to Remain in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/european-union">the 2016 referendum.</a></p>
      <p>"We need an MP who is prepared to respect the views of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> people on Brexit. The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> will ensure that the British people get the final say on Boris Johnson’s disastrous Brexit deal in a democratic People’s Vote."</p>
      <p>Hitting back hard at Labour's argument of a two horse race, he added: "Only the Liberal Democrats have ever defeated the Tories in Southport.</p>
      <p>"In 2017, when the Labour vote went up, the Liberal Democrats lost the seat and we ended up with a Conservative MP.</p>
      <p>"Labour have never won here, and their vote has gone down dramatically in the town since 2017.</p>
      <p>"Meanwhile, two major tactical voting organisations - Best for Britain and People’s Vote - are urging voters in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> to back John Wright; the Green and Renew Party candidates have stood aside to support me and polling organisations are saying the Lib Dems are the main challengers to the Tories in Southport."</p>
      <p>
        <b>How do local people feel about the election?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We've heard from the candidates about what they think could swing this intriguing three-way battle - but what do locals think are the main issues?</p>
      <p>We spent an afternoon in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a>, talking to voters about their thoughts on the area’s most meaningful contest in years.</p>
      <p>Tom Craven, 28, who works as a carer said: "I am voting for Labour as the Tories have made cuts across the board, crippling the NHS and emergency services. Not to mention they've repeatedly failed to get a good Brexit deal.</p>
      <p>"We need change, voting is like getting a bus - they may not be going exactly where you want but some are much closer to your destination than others."</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Just like Mr Craven, Jennifer Corcoran, 38, a paralegal, said: "I'll be voting Labour on December 12 because a Labour government is the only way we'll return to well resourced education and healthcare for all.</p>
      <p>"Their Green New Deal, equality and welfare commitments are bold and brilliant. And Liz [Savage] has a clear track record of working hard for the people of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a> and understands the local issues."</p>
      <p>"I’m essentially voting for a civilised society where everybody pays fair taxes, and there's a safety net for people who are having a difficult time."</p>
      <p>However, these views were far from unopposed in the town.</p>
      <p>Rikki Spofforth, 31, a legal executive said: "I’ll be voting for the Lib Dems.</p>
      <p>"They're the strongest and clearest Remain party and advocate revoking Article 50 if they win.</p>
      <p>"I also think our local councillors in Birkdale do a good job and they’re all Lib Dems."</p>
      <p>Eleanor Steele, 32, echoed this, saying: "I'm voting Lib Dem because Damien Moore is a huge Brexiteer, and Labour can't seem to give a definitive answer as to where they stand."</p>
      <p>One man said concerns about antisemitism in the Labour Party had pushed him to vote Tory.</p>
      <h4>To follow all our General Election coverage, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/general-election">click here</a></h4>
      <p>Local businessman Phil Goldberg, 53, said: "I feel that despite Boris being a bit... unorthodox, I do feel the country is safer in his hands than Corbyn's.</p>
      <p>"And as a Jewish man, I worry about the alleged antisemitism within the Labour Party.</p>
      <p>"Plus, the Tories are blue and I'm an Evertonian."</p>
      <p>Having enjoyed a 9% swing against the Lib Dems and good local council results, Labour are fighting hard to claim this seat for the first time ever.</p>
      <p>However, given how the national swing has moved in the other direction since, this really is anyone's for the taking.</p>
