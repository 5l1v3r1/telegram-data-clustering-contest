      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/justin-timberlake/">Justin Timberlake</a> has been seeing holding hands with co-star Alisha Wainwright having ditched his wedding ring.</p>
      <p>The star, who is married to Jessica Biel and shares son, Silas, four with the actor, looked cosy with his colleague as they were pictured enjoying a boozy night out recently.</p>
      <p>In images<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10409561/justin-timberlake-holds-hands-alisha-wainwright-strokes-knee-boozy/"> obtained by The Sun</a>, Alisha, 30, can be seen with her hand on 38-year-old Justin’s leg, while in another photo the pair hold hands under the table.</p>
      <p>Wearing a cap, Justin looks up at Alisha as she, at one stage, got up from her seat holding a bottle as she draped herself over a railing.</p>
      <p>The pair were sitting on a balcony, surrounded by other partygoers who all appeared to be having a wow of a time they joked with Justin, who was in great spirits.</p>

      <p>Justin, who married Jessica in 2012, was seen without his wedding band in the New Orleans bar, as he took a break from filming latest project, Palmer.</p>

      <p>In footage he appeared unsteady on his feet as he was helped up by another friend, leaving the area without Alisha, who remained and chatted with friends.</p>
      <p>According to the publication, the pair were on the balcony for around 40 minutes before leaving at 12.30am.</p>
      <p>This may be nothing more than a friendly interaction, with the pair surrounded by a larger group.</p>
      <p>However, neither Justin nor Alisha, or Jessica for that matter, have publicly addressed the images so far.</p>
      <p>Justin often shares gushing tributes to his wife, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/04/justin-timberlake-posts-sweet-birthday-tribute-to-wife-jessica-biel-8816366/">earlier this year posting a sweet message</a> to celebrate her 37th birthday.</p>
      <p>The singer shared a number of cute throwback pictures of the couple to celebrate the day, including selfies and posed backstage shots.</p>
      <p>In the post caption, he called his wife his ‘partner in this thang called life’ and described her as the ‘god of all smoke shows’.</p>
      <p>Justin wrote: ‘My partner in this thang called life… you are the most wonderful human I have ever met. You make me smile, laugh, and love life more than I knew I could. I cherish every moment with you and can’t wait to spend so many more years doing the same… but, new. Happy Birthday, you GOD OF ALL SMOKE SHOWS!! Love, Your Huz.’</p>
