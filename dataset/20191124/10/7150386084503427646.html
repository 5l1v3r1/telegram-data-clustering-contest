      <p>Remember the ‚Äòwinked girl‚Äô <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Priya-Prakash-Varrier/">Priya Prakash Varrier</a> who received her way to fame? The Malayalam actor became an overnight Internet sensation after a small video clip of hers from the song Manikya Malaraya Poovi from her debut film Oru Adaar Love, made it to the social media just in time for Valentine‚Äôs Day, earlier this year, and went viral in no time. The netizens soon termed her as the ‚ÄòNational crush‚Äô. Earlier today, she took to Instagram to share hot and sexy pictures in a red saree.</p>
      <p>Clad in a hot red six-yard by designer Michelle Edward, the Malayalam actor took to Instagram and posted a reel of herself in different poses. She captioned it as, ‚ÄúNot your kinda Desi Girlüíã‚Äù. With hair styled in soft curls, she opted for a subtle makeup and statement earrings.</p>
