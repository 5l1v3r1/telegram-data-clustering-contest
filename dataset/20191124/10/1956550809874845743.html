      <p>Just in time for the <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do/422620-celebrate-uae-national-day-2019-in-dubai">48th UAE National Day</a>, <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/416723-madinat-jumeirah-to-open-new-old-fashioned-bar-americano">Souk Madinat Jumeirah</a> has debuted a new art project with seven acclaimed regional artists to celebrate the UAE’s rich <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do">cultural heritage</a>.</p>
      <p>Through an ongoing collection of <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/culture">artworks</a> and installations, the fittingly named ‘Souk Seven’ – including artists Amalie Beljafla, Amrita Sethi, Mona Fares, Zeinab Al Hashemi, Noora Al Mazroui, Laila Masri and Fathima Mohiuddin – will narrate the emirate’s history.</p>
      <p>As a taste of what each of the artists have done, Beljafla has used oil and acrylic paint to create a “surreal, dreamlike and powerful” mural titled ‘Noor Zayed’, or light of Zayed, while Sethi’s signature voice note art uses acrylic paints to capture the soundwave pattern of ‘Souk Madinat Jumeirah’.</p>
      <p>Mohiuddin has used wall paint, acrylic and brushes to reference local bird species, the sun, moon, stars and Arabic mosaics, while Mona Fares’ mixed media piece uses a host of art materials inspired by the colours and textures of the UAE landscape.</p>
      <p>Exploring the link between the natural and industrial, Zeinab Al Hashemi’s piece uses reinforced metal mesh, wooden palm tree mesh and LED lighting, while Noora Al Mazroui uses a vinyl laser cut printer to create a mixed media piece of lines and patterns inspired by falcons and aspects of Emirati heritage.</p>
      <p>Finally, Laila Masri has used oils, acrylic paint and inks in a mixed-media piece which echoes the beauty and richness of colour found in souk culture and arts and crafts from the region.</p>
      <p>“Souk Madinat Jumeirah is an iconic destination that continues to connect visitors with a traditional Arabian experience blended with modern glamour and amenities,” said CEO Dubai Retail Nabil Ramadhan.</p>
      <p>“This exciting art project adds another fully immersive and memorable experience while celebrating seven of the city’s finest contemporary artists.”</p>
      <p>The art pieces can now be seen throughout <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do">Madinat Jumeirah</a>, and be sure to check back, as they collection will continue to grow over the next few months.</p>
