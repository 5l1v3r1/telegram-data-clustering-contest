      <p>He’s big, he’s strong, he’s heroic, and now Disney is trying to get their grubby mitts all over him.</p>
      <p>That’s right, Disney subsidiary and maker of some pretty good comics Marvel Entertainment is teaming up with Tsuburaya Productions, owners of <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/08/the-mind-behind-neon-genesis-evangelion-is-helping-to-make-a-new-ultraman-movie">Ultraman</a>, to produce new Ultraman comics and graphic novels.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/all-new-ultraman-stories-to-arrive-in-2020">statement released today</a>, Marvel’s Editor-in-Chief CB Cebulski commented, “Like Marvel, Ultraman captivated generations by telling spectacular stories grounded in the real world, and it continues to be a beloved classic through its television shows, movies, toys, games, comics, and more. We are so thrilled to introduce new chapters to the Ultraman Multiverse next year.”</p>
      <p>No word yet on creative teams or more detailed specifics about the offerings, but it is another prong in <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/12/plans-are-underway-to-build-a-new-ultramanlegacy-in-the-west">Tsuburaya’s moves</a> to make <i>Ultraman</i> <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/every-single-ultraman-series-is-making-its-way-to-the-u-1836259321">more accessible</a> to Western fans, a priority that was most directly showcased in the introduction of the Netflix Ultraman anime and an anime series based partially on <i>Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad</i>, the American adaptation of <i>Ultraman</i> spinoff character Gridman.</p>
      <p>Ultraman’s a rad character, a monster-fighting hero who prefigures some of the more well known (in the States) tokusatsu properties like <i>Super Sentai/Power Rangers</i>. So getting more Ultraman content in English is definitely exciting.</p>
      <p>More news will be forthcoming as we near the launch of these new books, which are slated for sometime in 2020.</p>
