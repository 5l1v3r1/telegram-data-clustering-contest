      <h1>Kohli shines as India close in on pink-ball triumph</h1>
      <h2>The India skipper scored yet another Test century before Ishant Sharma put the hosts on the brink of victory at Eden Gardens</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:11:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:11</time> by <a rel="author">AAP</a></address>
      <p>India captain Virat Kohli embellished the pink-ball Test with a sparkling century and his quick bowlers, led by Ishant Sharma, reduced Bangladesh to 6-152 as the hosts closed in on a 2-0 series sweep on day two of the second and final Test on Saturday.</p>
      <p>After India declared their first innings on 9-347 in their maiden day-night test, Bangladesh risked losing the match inside two days following a spectacular top-order collapse.</p>
      <p>Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah, who made 39 before a hamstring injury forced him to retire hurt, batted resolutely to force a third day at Kolkata's Eden Gardens.</p>
      <p>Mushfiqur will resume on 59 on Sunday, hoping to continue the fight though India look set to seal their 12th consecutive home series victory.</p>

      <p>Earlier, Kohli smashed a magnificent 136 and added 99 runs with Ajinkya Rahane who fell for a fluent 51.</p>
      <p>The India captain cover-drove Ebadot Hossain to reach 99 and, with the crowd chanting his name, took two off spinner Taijul Islam to bring up his 27th test century, and 20th as captain.</p>
      <p>He removed his helmet to soak up the applause but the proper celebration happened a little later when he hit Abu Jayed for four consecutive boundaries.</p>
      <p>Ebadot dismissed Kohli when Taijul moved from deep square leg and hurled himself into the air to take a stunning catch.</p>
      <p>Kohli hit 18 fours in his 194-ball vigil, outlasting the entire Bangladesh team who had folded in 30.3 overs in their first innings.</p>
      <p>Armed with the heavily-lacquered ball, Ishant Sharma, who had taken 5-22 in the first innings, wrecked the Bangladesh top order to return figures of 4-39.</p>
      <p>Mominul Haque made a nightmarish debut as Bangladesh's Test captain, being dismissed for a duck in both innings.</p>
      <p>Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah, however, refused to throw in the towel, displaying the stomach for a fight that was lacking among their team mates.</p>
