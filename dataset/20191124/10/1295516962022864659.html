      <p>Concept art for <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/gears-of-war/">Gears of War 4</a>,</i> which displays early designs of the creature Pouncer, have been revealed online.</p>
      <p>The artwork was posted to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B421X_wBXYc/">Instagram</a> by its designer, Jerad S. Marantz, and features more pink than may have been expected.</p>

      <p>Displaying two pictures of Pouncer, one being a close-up view, Marantz commented, "This early pass I went with gray [and] pinks for the color but that changed when we saw the creature in the environment. We had to make them sick so we moved on to red plates."</p>
      <p>In these photos, the intricate details of Marantz's creature design are evident. Jagged teeth and multiple eyes compliment Pouncer's claws, spikes and muscles. As indicated by Marantz, the skin on the bottom of the creature is evidently pink, while the protective plates on the top of Pouncer are made up of grays. It stands on all four of its legs with a formidable tail protruding from its back.</p>
      <p>Marantz's Instagram page also shows concept art from <i>Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame </i>and <i>Spider-Man: Far from Home.</i></p>
      <p><i>Gears of War 5</i> went on sale Sept. 10 and is available for purchase. Microsoft Game Pass Ultimate members gained early access on Sept. 6.</p>
