      <p>A drawbridge style path leads to an impressive tree house that looks like it was plucked straight out of a child's fantasy playground.</p>
      <p>With its own balcony, raised up on stilts in one of the garden's trees, the tree house also has a separate set of wooden steps leading down to the shrubbery below.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the garden, walled areas offer secret little hideaways, one of which has a circular stone seating area, while another suntrap has a bench and old waterpump.</p>
