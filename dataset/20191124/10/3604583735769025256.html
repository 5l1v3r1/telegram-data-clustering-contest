      <p>The Royal Commission into Victoria's mental health system will deliver its interim report next week, as questions continue over the planned transition of the Ballarat Health Services Continuing Care Unit to an Enhanced Recovery Model.</p>
      <p>Health and Community Services Union state secretary Paul Healey visited Ballarat on Thursday to press for the continued existence of the CCU, saying there was community and employee support for its future.</p>

      <p>"The expectation of all Victorians next Thursday is that the Royal Commission will deliver a roadmap for investment and expansion in our mental health services," said Mr Healey.</p>
      <p>"What is happening in Ballarat will undermine this. Now is not the time for essential mental health services to be cut anywhere; certainly not in Ballarat where the population is expected to grow significantly over the next decade, and where pressure on local mental health services is already great."</p>
      <p>Planning for the transition from the CCU to the Enhanced Recovery Model (ECRM) has been underway for some time, said a BHS spokesperson.</p>
      <p>"The ECRM is intended to increase local access to community-based clinical mental health services for people throughout the Grampians Region.</p>
      <p>The ECRM supports the principle that people tend to recover faster from mental illness when they can access treatment in the community and maintain important social, family, vocational and educational ties."</p>
      <p>"In combination with the other services, including the new Prevention and Recovery Centre (PARC) scheduled for completion in 2020, this model will enable Ballarat to provide care for patients requiring both long and short-term recovery. BHS will work with CCU residents to ensure they receive appropriate ongoing care at the time of closure, which may include an admission to the PARC or support through the ECRM program. There will be no job losses with the closure of the CCU."</p>
      <p>Mr Healey said a family member of a current resident at the CCU, who wishes to remain anonymous, told HACSU of their concerns for their family member, and the wider community, should the CCU closure go ahead without proper planning or consultation.</p>
      <p>He said the family member told the union the local community hasn't been properly consulted about the needs of people in Ballarat experiencing mental illness, or their families or carers.</p>
      <p>HACSU provided the following quotes:</p>
      <p>"[My family member] needed a transitional service to go to; we had nowhere to go until the CCU. Since they closed Lakeside Mental Health Hospital, people have had nowhere to go. People in our community are paying the price. Before the CCU, the problems had destroyed my faith in the mental health system."</p>
      <p>Mr Healey said HACSU has been actively campaigning against the proposed closure, and had done so since 2017 when the plans were first announced.</p>
      <p>"The union is actively engaging with its members, as well as community members and groups impacted by the proposed closure and will continue to campaign for improved mental health services in Ballarat and across Victoria."</p>
      <p>The Royal Commission into Victoria's Mental Health System will deliver its interim report to the Victorian Government on Thursday November 28.</p>
