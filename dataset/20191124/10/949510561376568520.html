      <p>DOUGLASSVILLE, Pa. (AP) — State police are investigating after they found three people dead following a garage fire at an eastern Pennsylvania home.</p>
      <p>Police in Berks County say crews were dispatched to the Union Township address shortly before 5:30 p.m. Saturday.</p>
      <p>The bodies of three people and the carcass of a pet were found, but there was no immediate word on the cause of death.</p>
      <p>Trooper David C. Beohm said early Sunday the victims had not been identified. He said it is still an “active crime scene.”</p>
      <p>Neighbors said a family of three — a couple and an adult son — moved to the property several years ago after losing their southern New Jersey home in Superstorm Sandy.</p>
