      <h1>Bristol City verdict: Familiar feeling as Robins fail to capitalise at Ashton Gate against Nottingham Forest</h1>
      <h2>Lee Johnson's team mis-fired in BS3 - as in past seasons</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:16:58+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:16</time> by <a rel="author">Gregor MacGregor</a></address>
      <p>As ever in football, as soon as a team fixes one area of their game another seems to fall apart. Consistency can be hard to achieve.</p>
      <p>And so it was on Saturday as <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> played out an eighth draw of the season the most in the Championship and were unable to take advantage of playing most of the second half against 10 men following Ryan Yates' second half dismissal.</p>
      <p>Here's our Bristol City reporter's analysis of the game and where the land lies after Matchday 17.</p>
      <p>As ever, plenty of positives and negatives...</p>

      <h3>Robins can't close the deal</h3>
      <p>As City fans will well attest, the Robins have been great on the road for several seasons now, but consistency at Ashton Gate has been hard to find.</p>
      <p>The 0-0 draw made it seven games unbeaten at Ashton Gate, but the Robins are drawing too many games currently to make the top six.</p>
      <p>Did Lee Johnson really need to play his five at the back system in BS3, with his two most creative players on the bench for this game? Should City not be more attacking on their own turf?</p>
      <p>The head coach will point to the fact that City did yet have some good chances, while it was at least back to back league cleans sheets for the first time this season.</p>
      <p>But that was a real opportunity to dent the aspirations of a league rival.</p>
      <h3>Forest impress</h3>
      <p>The Tricky Trees don't have a good record in the West Country of late (with four losses there in the last seven games) and will see that as a good point earned.</p>
      <p>Johnson was at pains following the match to point out the quality of the opposition, with only Leeds United and West Brom having taken more points on the road this season than either City or Forest.</p>
      <p>And Sabri Lamouchi too was very complimentary after the game about the hosts, musing that he was very happy to take a point from a difficult opponent with "many options".</p>
      <p>"In the second half, with one player less, it was very difficult but the attitude and the spirit of the players, those who came in like Albert, Rafa Mir and Joao, they worked a lot for the team and for me that is really important," he said after the game. "It was positive and it was a great point."</p>

      <p>"Theyâ€™re a very good side," added Johnson too. "We had a lot of final third entries but couldn't quite get that moment of brilliance or class to seal it."</p>
      <p>With a fine balance in attack of goal-scorer Lewis Grabban, the athletic Sammy Ameobi and the tricky Joe Lolley, that Forest side - with talents such as Joe Worrall and Matty Cash - look a good bet for the top six this campaign.</p>
      <h3><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> defensive improvement</h3>
      <p>If there is one major positive for City, it was the clean sheet at home. Another after Cardiff City and at least showing that the Robins are starting tighten up - which they need to improve.</p>
      <p>Four clean sheets in the last seven home games is a good platform to build on, and City must now find a way to score consistently at Ashton Gate.</p>
      <p>Ashley Williams and Bailey Wright both did well, and given that Tomas Kalas and Taylor Moore were both unavailable, there is real strength at the back for City.</p>

      <h3>Pereira the pick-out</h3>
      <p>And a key part of that defensive effort was 21-year-old right-back Pedro Pereira who got up and down the right flank all game and had a fine match.</p>
      <p>No player in the game game made more ball recoveries (winning loose balls) than the energetic former Benfica man, while Pereira also put over the joint second most crosses with several excellent centres finding Kasey Palmer and Famara Diedhiou.</p>
      <p>Pereira also completed the equal most passes in the final third of the pitch with Josh Brownhill, and made the joint second most dribbles in the game.</p>
      <p>The former Genoa man looks to be settling in the South West.</p>
      <h3>Marley Watkins' rough justice</h3>
      <p>While Famara Diedhiou was recalled after suspension, Marley Watkins was rather harshly dumped from the 18 altogether, despite two good battling displays in the last two matches, leading the line at Barnsley and Cardiff.</p>
      <p>Surely Watkins would have been a better bet than Rodri, who looks out of his depth in the Championship, and has shown little to deserve the cameo he was given on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Watkins was made to train on Saturday instead and will - maybe rightly - feel a bit aggrieved.</p>
