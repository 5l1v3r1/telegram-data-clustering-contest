      <p>Arjun Kapoor is currently gearing up for his next – Panipat in which he will be seen alongside Kriti Sanon. Helmed by Ashutosh Gowariker, the film will be bringing to light the third battle of Panipat. Now that the makers of the film have dropped the trailer and songs, fans are excited to watch Arjun in this never seen before avatar. Panipat stars the actor playing the role of Maratha warrior Sadashiv Rao Bhau. After watching the trailer fans have been comparing Kapoor’s look to Ranveer Singh's from Bajirao Mastani. The similarities are also being drawn because Singh also played the role of a Maratha warrior in his 2015 film. <br/><br/>Recently, when Arjun was asked if Ranveer saw the trailer of Panipat and what was his reaction, Arjun said, “He (Ranveer) got very excited seeing the trailer and I am happy about that. Look we are friends, apart from being actors. We are not constantly discussing acting and character development. We do films of the same genres as actors but eventually, the stories of these films are different. We have always interacted at a friendly level and never went into deep discussion,”</p>

      <p>While Arjun was busy shooting for Panipat, Ranveer was occupied with ’83. Recalling that moment, Arjun further revealed, “He would share pictures from '83 and I would share something from my shooting, and we would talk about it. But we never discussed beyond a point, as every director has a different vision for his or her film. If I ask him ‘tu hota to ye scene kaise karta', then I might corrupt my thinking,”</p>
      <p>Speaking of Panipat, the film is slated to hit the screens on December 6 and also features Sanjay Dutt, Mohnish Bahl and Padmini Kolhapuri in important roles.</p>
