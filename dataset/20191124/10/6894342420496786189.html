      <h1>iPhone 12 Pro And Pro Max Likely To Have 6GB Of RAM</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:56:25+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/ian/" target="_blank">Ian Chee</a></address>
      <p>It’s been slightly over two months since the launch of the <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/193700/apple-iphone-11-now-official-retails-for-us699/">iPhone 11</a> series. But that doesn’t stop analyst predictions of upcoming iPhone 12 series from coming out. MacRumors reports that Barclays analysts have shared their hardware predictions for the iPhones of 2020.</p>
      <p>To start, the analysts say that the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max will likely come with 6GB of RAM. They also expect that both phones with have rear-facing 3D sensors on them as well. The standard model, on the other hand, will come with 4GB, like this year’s iPhone 11 line.</p>
      <p>Next year’s iPhones will also be 5G ready, according to the analysts. While it’s unsure which tech the base iPhone 12 will support, the Pro and Pro Max models will be built with support for mmWave tech.</p>

      <p>Whether these predictions end up ringing true, we’ll have to wait for Apple to make the official announcement. These phones are expected to be unveiled in September of 2020, as is usually the case.</p>
      <p>On a related note, the analysts expect the <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/196373/analyst-report-supports-iphone-se-2-rumour-to-be-priced-at-us399/">iPhone SE 2</a> to be announced in March next year, with production beginning a month before, in February. No new predictions where specs are concerned though.</p>
