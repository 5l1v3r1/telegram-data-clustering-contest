      <h2>Netflix hit series The Crown talked about this elusive documentary</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p>Almost six decades ago, the Queen welcomed cameras into her home to film a behind-the-scenes documentary about her family.</p>
      <p>During this unprecedented show, crews enjoyed a rare opportunity to witness the private lives of the Monarch, Prince Philip and their children.</p>
      <p>Footage showed them doing their day-to-day things like chatting at the breakfast table and relaxing in their living room.</p>
      <p>Richard Cawston's two hour documentary 'Royal Family' aired on the BBC on June 21, 1969, with 37 million viewers settling down to watch, reports <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/behind-scenes-royal-family-documentary-20882270">the Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>But that was the first and last time viewers were ever allowed to watch the film. Afterwards the Queen had a change of heart, deciding it was too "too intrusive" and ordered for it to be kept hidden in the BBC vaults.</p>
      <p>And it wasn't just the Queen who wasn't happy with the footage.</p>
      <p>Princess Anne said: "I never liked the idea of 'Royal Family', I thought it was a rotten idea.</p>
      <p>"The attention which had been brought upon one ever since one was a child, you just didn't need any more."</p>

      <p>And since then little attention has been given to the documentary banish from history that is until the decision to pull the footage featured in season three of The Crown, where Olivia Colman plays the Queen.</p>
      <p>Michael Bradsell, the film's editor, revealed he was initially hesitant about sharing his work with Her Majesty.</p>
      <p>"We were all a little bit nervous of showing it to the Queen because we had no idea what she would make of it," he told Smithsonian Channel, who uploaded a clip of the documentary on YouTube.</p>
      <p>"She was a little critical of the film in the sense she thought it was too long, but Dick Cawston, the director, persuaded her two hours was not a minute too long."</p>

      <p>ABC's The Story of the Royals focused on the documentary, and a number of experts debated why the footage was banished.</p>
      <p>Royal biographer Hugo Vickers said: "Some people say that this would open the floodgates, and therefore after that all the sort of tabloid interest in them [would come after].</p>
      <p>"They would want to know more, and more, and more."</p>
      <p>Robert Lacey, historical consultant on Netflix show The Crown, explained: "They realised that if they did something like that too often, they would cheapen themselves, letting the magic seep out."</p>
      <p>Snippets of the film have been released for special occasions, including Prince Philip's 90th birthday and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. The Queen also allowed the National Portrait Gallery to play a small clip.</p>
      <p>"Legend has it that the Queen doesn't want parts of it to be shown," explained the National Portrait Gallery's Paul Moorhouse.</p>
      <p>"Regrettably, the film hasn't been seen for a long time. It just disappeared. There is a reluctance for this to be revisited."</p>
