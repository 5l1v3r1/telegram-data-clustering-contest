      <p>LONDON — British minister Michael Gove ruled out on Sunday asking the European Union for another Brexit delay to secure a new trading relationship with the bloc.</p>
      <p>Asked on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show whether a Conservative government would ask for an extension, Gove replied: “No … We’ll be out of the EU actually by January, we will have formally left.”</p>
      <p>“We’ve done a huge amount of work already, alongside the Withdrawal Agreement, in the political declaration which lays the groundwork for the deal we want … We will secure a deal.” (Reporting by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Mark Potter)</p>
