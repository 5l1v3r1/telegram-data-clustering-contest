      <h1>I'm A Celebrity viewers slam "cruel" use of live insects in new trial</h1>
      <h2>ITV bosses were thought to have banned stars from eating live bugs</h2>

      <p>Viewers of last night's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> have called the show's latest Bushtucker Trial "cruel".</p>
      <p>Saturday night's show saw all the celebrities reunited as those from main camp took part in a trial where they had to hold live insects in their mouths for 60 seconds.</p>

      <p>This, in turn, would free one of their campmates who were languishing in jungle jail.</p>
      <p>However, after I'm A Celebrity bosses previously assured viewers that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-stars-will-not-be-fed-live-insects-in-bushtucker-trials/">no live bugs would be eaten during this year's series</a>, the trial has been branded "cruel".</p>
      <aside>I thought they’d banned the use of live bugs in these trials?</aside>
      <p>Adele Roberts was first up – she held a spiny leaf insect in her mouth for a minute.</p>
      <p>Ian Wright's close encounter was perhaps the most disgusting to look at - he held wiggling witchetty grubs between his lips.</p>
