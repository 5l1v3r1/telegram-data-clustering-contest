      <p>Asterion Myth and Orange Esports clashed early in the game after both teams hot dropped in Los Leones. Orange Esports's Stalker eliminated Asterion's Lunatic to secure the first kill of the game. SynerGE was underwhelming in the first two games of the day but the team came alive in Miramar as AustinX single-handedly eliminated three members of Orange Esports. However, the tempo was short-lived as INS rushed on SynerGE to wipe their entire squad.</p>
      <p>It was a cluster at the end with IND, GoSkilla and Temp holding the same compound. The competition was cut-throat but it Mega Esports who ultimately won the Chicken Dinner as they eliminated three teams at a single go.
