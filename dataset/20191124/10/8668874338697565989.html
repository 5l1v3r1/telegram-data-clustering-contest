      <h1>The favourites to lure Sinckler away from Quins - report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:11:44+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:11</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Cameron</a></address>
      <p>A favourite has emerged to lure <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> tighthead <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins/players/kyle-sinckler/">Kyle Sinckler</a> away from Harlequins – according to a report this Sunday.</p>
      <p>The tighthead is set to come to the end of his contract with Quins by the end of this season, but talks appear to be stalling.</p>
      <p><i>The Rugby Paper</i> suggests that the British and Irish <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/lions">Lions</a> prop is the target of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester">Gloucester</a> Rugby – who could table a contract worth as much as £500,000 for the in-demand forward.</p>
      <p>Johann Ackermann’s side is in the market for a tighthead, and the capture of Sinckler would represent a major signing coup for the Cherry and Whites.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins">Harlequins</a> are enduring a mixed start to the season under Paul Gustard, sitting ninth in the Premiership with just one win.</p>
      <p>Sinckler has represented England at U16, U18, U19, and U20 levels before making his test debut as a replacement in England’s 37-21 win over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> at Twickenham on 12 Nov 2016.</p>
      <p>After making his first nine England appearances from the bench, Sinckler made his first start against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> during the 2018 Six Nations.</p>
      <p>The London born prop was picked for the British and Irish Lions squad in 2017 and won the penalty that led to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/owen-farrell/">Owen Farrell</a> kicking the Lions to a 24-21 victory in the second test.</p>
      <p>The 120kg prop however conceded the second most penalties of any player during the 2018-19 Premiership season with 29 behind Northampton’s Alex Waller. Harlequins captain <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins/players/chris-robshaw/">Chris Robshaw</a> spoke to him about discipline after he received a yellow card for slapping Sale’s Faf de Klerk in the chest.</p>
      <p>He was infamously described as an ‘emotional timebomb’ by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> coach Warren Gatland during the 2019 Six Nations. Subsequently, Sinckler conceded three penalties during England’s 21-13 defeat by Wales and was replaced in the 57th minute.</p>
