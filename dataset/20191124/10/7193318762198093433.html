      <p>Nearly 500 low-income, older Oklahomans died prematurely because the state did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/medicaid-expansion-has-saved-at-least-19000-lives-new-research-finds">report</a> by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank in Washington, D.C., found that 15,600 deaths among low-income people ages 55 to 64 in a four-year period could have been avoided if all states had expanded Medicaid.</p>
      <p>Conversely, states that did expand Medicaid averted roughly 19,200 deaths of people in that age range from 2014 through 2017, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Specifically in Oklahoma, the report estimates 476 near-elderly adults, who would have received Medicaid benefits under an expansion, died prematurely during that time frame because the state, under the leadership of former Gov. Mary Fallin, did not expand Medicaid.</p>
      <p>There have been a wealth of studies that have attempted to show the effects of Medicaid expansion, but this research begins to show that expansion can mean the difference between life and death, said Matt Broaddus, who co-authored the CBPP report.</p>
      <p>“This is the first time when researchers were able to put together an analytical method that gave them sort of enough statistical power, enough sample size to be able to show mortality rate changes that were statistically significant,” he said. “That’s maybe the step forward that this research is.”</p>
      <p>Republican leaders of Oklahoma’s House and Senate both dismissed the report’s findings this week. House Speaker Charles McCall and Senate Pro Tem Greg Treat said lifestyle choices are largely to blame for Oklahomans’ health problems, which can make finding a successful health care solution a difficult task.</p>
      <p>The report doesn’t specifically name 476 Oklahomans who died within that four-year window, said Hannah Katch, a senior policy analyst at CBPP.</p>
      <p>The number is an estimate of deaths based on an analysis of mortality data that combined U.S. Census Bureau data and Social Security Administration records to look at a specific subset of low-income people who would qualify for Medicaid under an expansion, she said. Other researchers have struggled to quantify the effects of Medicaid expansion because death records lack information on a person’s income, making it hard to know if they would have qualified for Medicaid.</p>
      <p>Treat said linking Oklahomans’ deaths to the state’s rejection of Medicaid expansion is irresponsible and reckless.</p>
      <p>“The outcome of studies like this is nearly always determined before the first bit of data is even examined,” he said. “Both sides of the debate on whether to expand Medicaid are legitimate, but this kind of inflammatory rhetoric denigrates our discourse by distracting us from working together to resolve the issue. What we know is that a lot of our poor health outcomes are a result of our unhealthy lifestyles and behaviors.”</p>
      <p>The CBPP report honed in on a <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26081">data analysis</a> by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which shows relatively even mortality rates across all states leading up to expansion and then a drop in mortality rates in the states that expanded in 2014. In the NBER analysis, researchers looked at roughly 566,000 people in most states.</p>
      <p>Medicaid expansion improves access to any number of health care services, including preventive screenings, regular wellness checkups, access to treatment for behavioral health conditions, affordable prescription medications, all of which combine to help people live longer, Katch said.</p>
      <p>“I hope this is more evidence demonstrating the importance of expanding Medicaid and the importance of expanding Medicaid without putting unnecessary restrictions on access to that coverage, like taking coverage away from people who don’t meet work requirements or charging premiums,” she said. "Those and other restrictions that make it harder for people to gain and maintain their coverage could have fatal effects.”</p>
      <p>According to the CBPP report, California saved 4,448 lives through Medicaid expansion. On the other end of the spectrum, Texas could have averted 2,920 premature deaths through expansion, according to the report.</p>
      <p>McCall questioned the methodology for the NBER analysis titled <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26081">"Medicaid and Mortality"</a> and noted the paper was not peer-reviewed, which can hold academic works to more rigorous standards.</p>
      <p>“Insurance status is a far smaller factor in life expectancy than lifestyle choices,” he said. “To truly improve health, lifestyle choices have to be improved, and we are working to do that to the extent government can while also determining the most responsible way to approach Medicaid. To see how states with expanded Medicaid still face health outcome problems, look no further than Arkansas, which expanded Medicaid in 2014 and still has worse health outcomes than Oklahoma.”</p>
      <p>Both Oklahoma and Arkansas are among the least healthy states, according to numerous reports.</p>
      <p>Medicaid expansion is poised to be a hotly debated issue in Oklahoma next year as an initiative petition seeks to let voters decide whether the state should expand Medicaid to adults whose income does not exceed 133% of the federal poverty level.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Gov. Kevin Stitt is working on an alternative health care plan, which he has hinted may be based on a Medicaid block grant. Members of the Republican-controlled Legislature also are taking steps to come up with their own health care solution to rival proposed State Question 802. Similar to Stitt, they have been tight-lipped about the details.</p>
      <p>Stitt said Medicaid expansion is wrong for Oklahoma because it commits the state to a mandate from the “failed” Obamacare era.</p>
      <p>“We want every Oklahoman to live to their full potential which will require health care reform, both at the state and federal levels, that empowers people with affordable access to patient-centered care,” he said in a statement. “My administration is actively working on a plan that we look forward to sharing in the coming weeks.”</p>
      <p>The Oklahoma Health Care Authority recently hired a Medicaid consultant to help Stitt put the finishing touches on his health care plan.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma is among the 14 states that have not expanded Medicaid.</p>
