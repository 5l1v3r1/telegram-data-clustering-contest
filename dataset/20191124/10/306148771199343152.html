      <p>An anonymous reader quotes the International Business Times: <i>At the recent Tianfu cup held in Chengdu, China, Chinese China's top white-hat hackers have converged to test zero-days against top software available in the market today. During the first day of the event, Chinese security researchers <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/chinese-hackers-break-chrome-safari-edge-reveal-browsers-vulnerabilities-2869812">were able to break into major browsers such as Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Google Chrome</a>.<br/><br/>Since March 2018, the Chinese government has officially discouraged security researchers from joining hacking competitions outside the county. The recent Tianfu Cup is the venue for hackers to showcase their skills and even earn six-figure bounties for successful exploits. Former Pwn2Own winner Team 360 Vulcan took home $382,500 for successfully hacking the old version of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/chrome-edge-safari-hacked-at-elite-chinese-hacking-contest/">Office 365, Microsoft Edge, Adobe PDF Reader, VMWare Workstation, and gemu+ Ubuntu</a> during the two days event, reports ZDNet... Search engine giant Google has a representative in the event with some members of the Google Chrome security team present on site. Organizers plan to submit a report of all bugs uncovered during the event to all vendors when the competition concludes, says ZDNet.</i></p>
