      <p>The multi-talented transwoman Ivanka Das who works as a dance choreographer and a model will be seen playing a brothel owner in the upcoming web series #Mandi.</p>
      <p>Ivanka is the first bald trans choreographer from queer community. She was last seen in Dance Deewane, where she won accolades from judge Madhuri Dixit for her confidence. We heard she has been roped in to play a power-packed role in the web show #Mandi. The series will showcase the journey of a girl who is in search of her sexuality and wants to explore her sexual boundaries.</p>

      <p>Spotboye.com got in touch with Ivanka and she told us, “I’m working as a choreographer and fashion dance director from last 17 years. 2 years ago, I started working as a model and since then I am also doing theatre. And now, I will be making my debut in digital world with this web series."</p>
      <p>She further added, "I am playing the role of Kareena, who is a brothel owner. She is self dependent and because she has gone through a lot, she became bossy as well."</p>

      <p>When quizzed as to what convinced her to take up the show, the bald and bold Ivanka said, "The story is heart-touching. I was moved after hearing it, because somewhere I relate to my on-screen character. My role is quite impactful and I am feeling delighted because I got an opportunity to be part of this beautiful web series. I am grateful to our producer Mohini (Shabade) for giving me this break."</p>
      <p>For the uninitiated, the web show was earlier titled Brothel. It is produced by Mohini Shabade, Ashu Dhaliwal and Akshy Mishra under the banner Mighty Grace Media. Also, Mohini has co-produced Chak De Fame Sagarika Ghatge's upcoming Marathi film titled Monsoon Football.</p>
