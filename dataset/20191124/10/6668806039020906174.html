      <h1>Sanjay Leela Bhansali says Baiju Bawra is his biggest challenge till date</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:46:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.filmfare.com/search/author_Filmfare" target="_blank">Filmfare</a></address>
      <p>Sanjay Leela Bhansali is currently busy working on his next – Baiju Bawra which features Alia Bhatt in the lead. It’s for the first time that SLB is directing a full-fledged musical since it is a story about two singers Tansen and Baiju.</p>
      <p>Opening up about the project, Bhansali calls Baiju Bawra the biggest challenge of his career. He said, “I am not even thinking of the colossal music Naushad saab did in Baiju Bawra in 1952. It is impossible to scale those heights. Who can sound as pristine and sublime as Lataji did in Mohe Bhool Gaye Saawariya and Bachpan Ki Mohabbat' in the earlier Baiju Bawra? There can never be another singer like Lataji. But I will continue to look for echoes of her voice in all the female singers I work with,”</p>

      <p>Interestingly, the filmmaker started composing music for his own films ever since Goliyon Ki Rasleela: Ram-Leela. Latest reports suggest that he's planning to introduce a new voice with the film. Stay tuned for more updates on the same.</p>
