      <p><b>Leganes’</b> Nigeria international Kenneth Omeruo picked up an injury as his club suffered a 2-1 defeat to Barcelona at the Estadio Municipal de Butarque on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Omeruo had a fine game for the Los Pepineros despite their defeat but was substituted in the 82nd minutes after suffering a discomfort in his left thigh.</p>
      <p>“Omeuro leaves with discomfort and enters Rodri Tarín,” the club wrote on the official Twitter handle.</p>
      <p>The central defender was later seen holding his left thigh as he made his way to the bench after being substituted.</p>
      <p>The Leganes number 4 man was one of the club’s best performer in the game as he frustrated Barcelona’s Luis Suarez on couple of occasions and even thwarted Lionel Messi’s chance of scoring.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old missed Nigeria’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho due to a niggling injury.</p>
