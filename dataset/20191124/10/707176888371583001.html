      <h1>Labour plans to spend £58bn on women’s pension pledge</h1>
      <h2>‘Expensive’ policy was not counted in manifesto document</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:30:03+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:30</time> by <a rel="author">George Parker, Josephine Cumbo</a></address>
      <p>Shadow chancellor John McDonnell on Sunday pledged to address the “historic injustice” facing women affected by a sharp rise in the state pension age with a £58bn spending commitment.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes just days after Labour published a “fully costed” <a href="https://labour.org.uk/manifesto/">election manifesto</a>, but Mr McDonnell acknowledged the pension spending was not counted in the party’s costings document and was “expensive”.</p>
      <p>He told Sky News the spending was a “very specific arrangement”, and that the country owed “a debt of honour” to women born in the 1950s who say they were given insufficient notice of big changes to the state pension age.</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell told the Observer newspaper that Labour would introduce a universal scheme that would see the women affected given a maximum payment of £31,300, although the average amount would be £15,380.</p>
      <p>Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the Labour policy would be paid for by “another £12bn on borrowing for the next five years”.</p>
      <p>Women Against State Pension Inequality, the campaign group, said it welcomed Labour’s commitment to address the “financial injustice” faced by 3.8m 1950s-born women who did not receive “fair notice” of changes to their state pension age.</p>
      <p>“We await the detail with interest and urge the party to develop a clear framework which outlines how and when this would be implemented,” said a spokesperson for the group.</p>
      <p>WASPI claimed that women affected by the changes to their pension age, raising it from 60 to 66, represented about 8 per cent of the electorate and “we encourage all parties to recognise that”.</p>
      <p>In 1995 the Conservative government legislated to increase women’s state pension age from 60 to 65 between 2010 and 2020.</p>
      <p>However, in 2011 the coalition government accelerated this timetable so that the female pension age reached 65 in 2018.</p>
      <p>In October, the High Court in London dismissed a legal challenge by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c33bf7ba-e425-11e8-a8a0-99b2e340ffeb">BackTo60</a>, a campaign group, that claimed the increase in female pension age from 60 to 66 amounted to gender and age discrimination against 3.7m women.</p>

      <p>A further claim that the women were not given sufficient notice of the increase in their pension age was not upheld by the court.</p>
      <p>Last week Boris Johnson, the prime minister, was criticised by a woman who was affected by the pension issue during a BBC election debate involving party leaders.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said his government could not afford to offer compensation to all the women who say they have been left out of pocket by the increased pension age.</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell will face Tory accusations that he is making up policies as he goes along as part of a Labour bid to close a big gap in opinion polls with the Conservatives ahead of the December 12 election.</p>
      <p>Chancellor Sajid Javid said Labour would allow government debt “to run out of control”.</p>
      <p>“They are throwing out policies like confetti with billions of pounds of extra costs,” he added.</p>
      <p>Mr Javid claimed there would be a “crisis by Christmas” if Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Mr McDonnell won the election.</p>
