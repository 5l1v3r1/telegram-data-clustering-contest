      <p>A video showing a pregnant woman mixing organic skincare products for sale has quickly gone viral.</p>
      <p>In the video, the pregnant woman sitting on a stool was dragging herself on it while pouring some of the ingredients into over 6 big bowls filled with the products to be used.</p>

      <p>The video went viral for different reason as some wonder how she is able to sell this large amount of products she is making, some others are shocked she wasn’t measuring the amount of ingredients she was pouring into each of the bowls with some ingredients already mixed and a few others were commending her strength and ability to still do this swiftly while heavily pregnant.</p>

      <blockquote>I saw this lady mixing “organic” skincare products on the gram and was worried that people didn’t seem to be worried. – @tirbaby<br/><br/>I dunno if that’s palm oil or something. Anyways after getting stretch marks from using Medas Botanics herbal soap, I gave up on any product that is mixed for use. The ingredients in these soaps/creams are unknown and probably dangerous. – @ThefirstLady___<br/><br/>No measurements,no gloves ☠️☠️☠️ – @justOlowo<br/><br/>Lool, no measurement oh. As the spirit leads. Plus, what are allllll those powders??? They look like acids to me. I know kojic acid, salicylic acid, alpha arbutin, glutathione, all come in powder form for lab manufacturing.. 😭 So shes just using no formula plus unlisted things. – @KillingPython<br/><br/>Organic skincare🙄🙄🙄 Looks like something sanctified to be offered to a deity….😏😏 – @Olusegun_09</blockquote>
