      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Fazlur Rehman has called multiparty conference (MPC) of the opposition parties on November 26 aimed at discussing next course of action against the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).</p>
      <p>Sources told the media that Fazl has invited several influential politicians including Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s (PML-N) Ahsan Iqbal and Pakistan Peoples Party’s (PPP) Bilawal Bhutto Zardari to attend the meeting.</p>
      <p>In an apparent bid to reorganise political campaign for pressurising the government, the opposition parties seem to formulate new strategy in the light of recommendation made by opposition’s Rehbar Committee.</p>
      <p>Fazl telephoned Ahsan Iqbal and other politicians to attend the important meeting.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the JUI-F chief and Bilawal agreed to make the committee more active, and spoke about certain political matters. Both leaders are expected to meet in the next few days.</p>
