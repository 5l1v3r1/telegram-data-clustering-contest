      <h3>DINALUPIHAN, Bataan— Vice President Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo lauded Thursday the Bahay Pagbabago Community-based Reformation Center in Dinalupihan as it marks its third anniversary.</h3>
      <p>Robredo, who co-chairs the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs, referred to illegal drugs as illness of the society needed to be addressed by the community.</p>
      <p>“Ang pinag-uukulan natin ng panahon ngayon ay iparamdam sa bawat Pilipino na problema nating lahat ito para tulong-tulong tayo sa paghanap ng solusyon (What we are trying to do today is make every Filipino feel that this is a problem to all of us so we could all unite to find a solution),” Robredo said during the Bahay Pagbabago third anniversary celebration held at Bulwagan ng Bayan.</p>
      <p>She also praised the municipal government of Dinalupihan, national government agencies, civil society organizations, faith-based and volunteer groups for uniting to combat illegal drugs in the province.</p>
      <p>“Hindi ito problema lamang ng pulis, hindi problema lamang ng local government unit, hindi ito problema lamang ng barangay, pinakita niyo po dito sa Dinalupihan na ang impossible ay maaring maging possible pag tayo nagtulong tulong (This is not just a problem of the police, not just a problem of the local government unit, not just a problem of the barangay. You showed here in Dinalupihan that the impossible would be possible if we all help each other),” Robredo added.</p>
