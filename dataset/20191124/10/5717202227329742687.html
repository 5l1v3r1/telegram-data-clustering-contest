      <h1>Tony Adams suggests two Premier League managers to replace Unai Emery at Arsenal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:57:21+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://sport.bt.com/video/adams-slams-arsenals-lack-of-progression-under-emery-91364412890815">Tony Adams has told BT Sport</a> that Arsenal should consider parting ways with Unai Emery after Saturday’s 2-2 draw with Southampton, and bring in either Burnley’s Sean Dyche or Bournemouth’s Eddie Howe.</p>
      <p>Emery’s side only managed to scrape a draw against Southampton at The Emirates, scoring in the 96th minute to secure a point. But it was a dreadful performance that saw Arsenal fans boo their players off the pitch at full-time.</p>
      <p>Arsenal sit in seventh place on 18 points, 19 behind leaders Liverpool and only eight above the relegation zone – prior to Sunday’s clash between Manchester United and Sheffield United. They have failed to win in their last five league games.</p>
      <p>Many are calling for former Paris Saint-Germain manager Emery to be sacked by the board, after seeing their north London neighbours appoint Jose Mourinho. Arsenal legend Adams believes the Gunners need a manager like Dyche or Howe.</p>

      <p>“I don’t think Freddie (Ljungberg) is ready,” <a href="https://sport.bt.com/video/adams-slams-arsenals-lack-of-progression-under-emery-91364412890815">Adams said</a>. “Look at Sean Dyche, we don’t look at our own sometimes. He’s done a marvelous job. Eddie Howe? These kind of coaches.</p>
      <p>“They can organise teams. They know the Premier League, they have been working quite a long time in the Premier League. Give them kind of guys a go.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Proven PL manager, or big name like Allegri?</h3>
      <p>Max Allegri remains out of work after his stint at Juventus came to an end, but the Italian has no Premier League experience and in Emery, it has hurt Arsenal. Getting a manager that knows England’s top tier is crucial.</p>
      <p>Whether Adams’ suggestions in Howe and Dyche have the calibre, is another question. There are a lot egos in Arsenal’s dressing room, and a manager of Howe or Dyche’s stature may see Arsenal’s big players turn against them.</p>
      <p>A proven Premier League manager with a big reputation is key. Mauricio Pochettino is out of work, but he is unlikely to swap Spurs for Arsenal. Perhaps, Rafa Benitez could be an option, as he continues to manage in China with Dalian Yifang.</p>
