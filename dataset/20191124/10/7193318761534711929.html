      <p>‘Tis the season for spending, and 63% of us feel pressured to overdo it this time of year.</p>
      <p>That’s according to a recently released report by New York-based Bankrate.com.</p>
      <p>Based on an online survey of 2,628 U.S. adults in October by YouGov Plc for Bankrate, most of us feel pushed to shell out more than we want. That’s not only on gifts (51%), but also on travel (33%), hosting parties (36%) and even charity (36%).</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, parents of minor children are most likely to feel the burn, with 71% reporting excessive expenditures for the holidays.</p>
      <p>A separate October survey of 1,000 adults by Edelman Intelligence for Los Angeles-based Union Bank found 40% of consumers feel pressured to spend on people they don’t want to; more for Millennials (56%), or those born in the early 1980s. Meanwhile, one in five Gen Z'ers (born in the mid- to late 1990s) plan to make the holidays extra jolly for themselves and Mom, possibly spending more than $250 on the two gifts.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Making the list</b>
      </p>
      <p>Forty percent of U.S. consumers focus their gift-giving efforts on family and friends, according to the Union Bank survey. However, Gen Z (35%) and Millennials (34%) are more likely to extend their pocketbooks to their work colleagues. Eighty-one percent of all respondents plan to buy a gift for their pet, with 20% of Gen Z setting aside more than $50.</p>
      <p>Among adults with significant others, half are at odds about how much to spend on each other, while half believe they spend more on their significant other's gift than their significant other spends on theirs. Men are more likely than women to think so (58% versus 38%).</p>
      <p>Though most U.S. consumers (66%) plan to give open-able presents to those on their lists, Americans prefer gift cards (51%) or cash (45%) over open-able gifts (41%), Union Bank found.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Realistic ways to save</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pierre P. Habis, head of consumer banking at Union Bank, urges couples and others to use the holidays as an opportunity “to talk about money and adopt better financial habits that will help us all year long."</p>
      <p>Though two of three U.S. consumers set budgets, it takes six months for 33% of us to recover from the holidays and pay off credit card debt, Habis said.</p>
      <p>"Having a realistic budget and planning ahead are the best ways to control holiday spending," said Tonya Rapley, millennial money expert, creator of the award-winning site My Fab Finance, and Union Bank expert partner.</p>
      <p>"Start with creating a budget that works with your holiday plans and wallet. Write a list of all the people you want to buy for, and include other related holiday expenses, such as travel costs, hostess gifts, gift wrap, holiday groceries, etc., and set a dollar amount for each. Also, the earlier you start, the more you can shop around for sales and special deals,” Rapley said. "It's important to remain focused and resist temptation to add last-minute impulse items when you're pressed for time or want to make your gift seem more meaningful."</p>
      <p>Similarly, Adrian Garcia, data analyst at Bankrate.com said, “Whether you’re purchasing gifts or traveling, avoid getting wrapped up in the pressure by setting expectations with your loved ones and sticking to your budget. You can also get creative and find alternative ways to give this holiday season.”</p>
      <p>According to Bankrate, popular remedies for overspending on gifts include limiting gift exchanges to immediate family (53%), actively seeking out coupons and store sales (53%) and giving homemade gifts (36%).</p>

        <b>Facebook friends chime in</b>
      </p>
      <p>My friends on Facebook are doing as much.</p>
      <p>“We set limits and I try to get them (her children and grandchildren) to send me a list of likes and wants. Depending on prices, we’ll determine the number of gifts and try to spend equally,” Sheryl Dale said, noting “it’s worked for over 50 years so far.”</p>
      <p>Now that his nephews and nieces are grown and married, Corey Trautvetter’s large family draws names among the adults for one “nice gift — $175 to $200. Then we all buy for the little kids, and buy fun, small gifts for each other,” he said.</p>
      <p>Perhaps my Midwest City High School classmate Mike Schulz has the best advice: “No credit cards.”</p>
