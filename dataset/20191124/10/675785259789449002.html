      <h2>Stephen Willey is now learning to walk, talk and eat again after a brutal attack by thug Nicholas Graham in Newcastle two days before Christmas in 2015 left him in a coma</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:09:21+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:09</time> by <a rel="author">Lisa Hutchinson, https://www.facebook.com/LisaHutchinson68/, Anna Ye</a></address>
      <p>A man who spent three years in a coma after a one-punch attack will be spending his first Christmas with his family since waking up.</p>
      <p>Stephen Willey, 49, was put into a coma after he was randomly attacked by Nicholas Graham while waiting for a bus in Newcastle on December 23, 2015. His skull was fractured and the attack caused serious brain injuries.</p>
      <p>The former Nissan worker awoke in January this year and is learning to walk, talk and eat again, the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/punch-victim-washington-coma-christmas-17298603">Chronicle Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Being in a coma has meant he has missed the past four Christmases. So this year will be extra special as Stephen will finally be able to sit at the dinner table with his family.</p>
      <p>His wife Paula, parents Linda and David, brothers Neil and Chris, and sister-in-laws Andrea and Kathryn are looking forward to the festive get-together.</p>

      <p>Dad David, 72, from Washington, said: "We’ll be having <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas-dinner">Christmas dinner</a> at Neil and Kathryn’s this year, if Kathryn can get the time off work, because they have more space than us. But if not we will be having it here at our house and Stephen will be at the table having Christmas dinner.</p>
      <p>"He’ll be having turkey and all the trimmings but it will be liquidised for him. It will be our first Christmas after he fully emerged from his coma and we are all looking forward to it."</p>
      <p>The senseless attack happened two days before Christmas in 2015 when Stephen went into Newcastle to meet his wife Paula after she had been out for a meal with her colleagues.</p>
      <p>The couple were waiting for a bus on New Bridge Street just after 8am when they encountered Graham, who was angry after an argument with his former girlfriend.</p>
      <p>Graham barged into Stephen for no reason and punched him, knocking him to the ground and causing serious injuries to his skull and brain.</p>

      <p>Stephen was taken to hospital and underwent emergency surgery. He was then taken to Walkergate Park Centre in Newcastle For Neurorehabilitation and Neuropsychiatry and Northview Lodge in Castletown,  <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland">Sunderland.</a></p>
      <p>Graham, 30, of Belsay Gardens, Red House Farm, Newcastle, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm and breaching the restraining order to stay away from his ex-girlfriend. He also breached previously imposed community orders.</p>
      <p>The maintenance engineer was jailed for three-and-a-half years in May 2016.</p>
      <p>Dad David added: "He got three-and-a-half years and was out in 17 months, we got the real punishment. When you look at Stephen you can’t believe this happened to him.</p>
      <p>"Paula and Linda are at Northview six days a week seeing him. They get one day off a week and we all go but everyday there is someone there. Paula is so caring, he’s got a good one there in Paula.</p>

      <p>"This year will be the first Christmas he’s been awake from his coma. Paula will be buying him Christmas presents, she’s looking quite excited. She’s always buying him clothes as she likes him to look smart in his chair, she’s so kind.</p>
      <p>"But this will be quite a special year when we all sit around the table."</p>
      <p>Stephen now eats liquidised meals, as well as mousses and a coffee with a thickening agent.</p>
      <p>"We keep saying we’ll be getting him a bottle of wine soon and he smiles," David added.</p>
      <p>Stephen, who was a keen cyclist, and would ride around five times a week, regularly doing 100 miles every week. But he now needs 24-hour care and is now trying to rebuild his strength.</p>

      <p>David added: "He can’t stand up and has to be hoisted from his chair and his bed every day. But he knows what we are saying and we can tell what he’s saying in his own way.</p>
      <p>"He can be funny as well. He knows his twin nieces, Lucy and Emily, who are nine months old. He’ll sit with one of them in his arms and he can say their names.</p>
      <p>"We hope he will be able to speak again and hopefully stand up. But not even the top neurosurgeons can tell us what is going to happen. We just hope he will."</p>
      <p>As Graham was jailed at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-crown-court">Newcastle Crown Court</a> , Paula spoke of the consequences of the attack on her husband. </p>
      <p>Paula described the moment the couple became aware of thug Graham: "The look on his face and what happened next will haunt me for the rest of my life.</p>

      <p>"He pushed me out of the way and the next thing I saw was Stephen falling flat to the ground, then I heard the horrific crack when his head hit the pavement."</p>
      <p>Paula and Stephen were childhood sweethearts and have been together for 31 years.</p>
      <p>Paula said: "I love him so much, I always have and I always will. He is such an amazing person with so much determination.</p>
      <p>"After it happened he slowly, slowly moved up the conscious scale and it was on January 17 he was diagnosed that he’d emerged from his coma. It was incredible for us. It was then we could start a rehabilitation programme. It was just amazing.</p>
      <p>"We got him home for Christmas last year but this year it is the first time he will sit at the table and be able to eat a Christmas dinner - but he is on a pureed diet.</p>

      <p>"He’s always loved Christmas, just putting up the decorations and playing the Christmas tunes. I’ve started his Christmas present shopping and I’ve got him t-shirts, trainers, trousers and aftershave. It’s really exciting.</p>
      <p>"Although we’ve been together for 31 years we’ve only been married for six. We got married in New York on July 26 2013 and didn’t tell anyone. We didn’t want any fuss.</p>
      <p>"He’s such an amazing person. He’s having to learn how to do everything again. He’s not ready to walk yet as he hasn’t got the strength in his truck, but he’s getting stronger."</p>
      <p>She added: "The care he received from day one has been amazing, initially in the Royal Victoria Infirmary and Walkergate Park Neuro Rehab. </p>
      <p>"The staff at Northview Lodge care home, where he’s been for last three years, are phenomenal. They played a pivotal part in him emerging from the coma and in his ongoing recovery."</p>
      <p>Paula is raising awareness about how dangerous one punch can be and supports the One Punch North East campaign.</p>
