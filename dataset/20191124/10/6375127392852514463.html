      <h3>ACTING on instructions from Police Regional Office 4-A director, Brigadier General Vicente D. Danao Jr., the Cavite Police Provincial Office’s top cop this week started on-the-spot inspection of all local police stations and their lock-up facilities.</h3>
      <p>Colonel Marlon R. Santos said he first checked the Cavite City Police Station to look the operational readiness of his men and their facilities including their detention cells.</p>
      <p>“Gen. Danao has ordered us to see to it that all our stations and headquarters will be as clean as possible, spick and span particularly its surroundings, toilets, offices, parking areas and jails,” said Santos.</p>
      <p>The official also encouraged his men to further involve the community and other stakeholders in their ongoing crime prevention and crime solution efforts.</p>
      <p>“We are particularly asking the help and the vigilance of the citizenry in our ongoing war on drugs and other forms of criminality as well as rogues in uniform,” Santos said.</p>
