        <b>David Beckham’s new club Inter Miami are reportedly preparing to make a huge offer to Real Madrid attacking midfielder James Rodriguez as they line up this ambitious transfer raid.</b>

      <p>The MLS club will no doubt be looking to start with a bang with some big-name signings, and it looks like Rodriguez is one of their main targets.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.donbalon.com/futbol/laliga/james-rodriguez-tiene-nueva-oferta-le-dobla-sueldo">Don Balon</a>, Inter Miami could try offering the Colombia international close to double his current wages, upping his salary to around £10.7million a year, up from £6m.</p>
      <p>This kind of money is sure to turn plenty of heads, even if a talent like Rodriguez might also feel he still has something to offer in a more competitive league.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old has looked a world class performer at various points in his career, though it’s fair to say he’s not looked too close to that level for some time now.</p>

      <p>It’s been a difficult spell for Rodriguez at the Bernabeu, though he showed some signs of improvement during a loan spell with Bayern Munich, even if it wasn’t enough to result in the transfer being made permanent.</p>
      <p>At this point, it might well be the best move for Rodriguez to accept the big money and move to the MLS for the latter stages of his career.</p>
