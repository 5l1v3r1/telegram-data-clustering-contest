      <h1>The weird way that Wolves are proving pundit Paul Merson right</h1>
      <h2>Ben Husband tackles the talking points, including Merse's silly musings, as he reflects on the win at Bournemouth</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:00:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers climbed to 5th in the Premier League after a 2-1 win at Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>First half goals from Joao Moutinho and Raul Jimenez earned Wolves their second successive league win, but had to weather a late storm from the 10 man Cherries, who could have twice snatched a point in the closing stages.</p>
      <p>Here are our findings from the game:</p>
      <h3>Merson’s silly comments</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Months after labelling Adama Traore ‘cringeworthy’, Paul Merson has put his foot in his mouth once again.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of today’s game he suggested that Wolves were lucky to have Nuno and that he could leave for a ‘top six’ side.</p>
      <p>“I worried about these at the start of the season,” he said, “Because last year, they beat the good teams and I thought, if they don’t start beating the bad ones, they aren’t going to keep beating the good ones.”</p>

      <p>“I like the manager, I think they are fortunate to have this manager. I don’t mean that disrespectfully but I think he could take one of the top six jobs. I’d take him at Arsenal tomorrow morning.”</p>
      <p>Well ‘Merse’ after more than a dozen games, guess what? Wolves are a top six side. They were arguably one of the best six teams in the division last season and this time around there is an even stronger argument.</p>
      <p>They say teams reflect their manager. And like Nuno, Wolves are ruthlessly aggressive and focused. So in a way, Merson is right. He may be managing a top six club. But it may be the one already at his disposal.</p>
      <h3>Jimenez’s hunger</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>While some were going through the motions in the warm-ups at the Vitality, Jimenez was buzzing around the pitch.</p>
      <p>If there was any jetlag from his international exploits, he disguised it majestically.</p>
      <p>During a routine shooting drill, the Mexican sensation was visibly distraught every time one of his efforts didn’t hit the back of the net. He has an insatiable hunger to score goals and this season, there are few better at doing that in world football.</p>
      <p>That may sound a stretch, but his goal on the south coast brings his tally of goal contributions to a staggering 18 (14 goals, 4 assist) in 22 appearances.</p>
      <p>He was as shocked as the away end when his second half header flashed wide.</p>
      <p>There was much discussion ahead of his big money move in the summer, but with every passing week, it looks more of a snip.</p>
      <p>The list of strikers Wolves would rather have is becoming shorter and shorter.</p>
      <h3>Moutinho’s magic</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>If Jimenez is a wonderful scorer of goals, then Moutinho is a scorer of wonderful goals. His first half strike made much of the home end stand in appreciation.</p>
      <p>But it wasn’t just his goal that made his performance so impressive. Throughout the game, he dictated play,  he created chances and controlled the tempo of proceedings.</p>
      <p>His quick thinking helped create the second and his calmness helped Wolves see it out.</p>
      <p>Unusually for Nuno,  he singled out the midfielder for praise: “Joao is an important player because he has the experience to know at each moment what the game requires.”</p>
      <p>At 33, Moutinho is still in the upper echelons of midfielders in the country. He is, quite ridiculously, getting better in a Wolves shirt. Fans want to see new faces in January, but the reaction to his new contract confirms that it is the most important deal Wolves will strike this season.</p>

      <h3>Close to unstoppable</h3>
      <p>For the first 11 Premier League games, fans would have been inclied to stay in the concourse until half time.</p>
      <p>Until the last two weeks, Wolves only started on the second half whistle. However, the wins over Villa and Bournemouth have been built on the foundations of stunning first half shows.</p>
      <p>Against the Cherries in particular, Wolves were near perfect in the opening period and if they were five up, there would have been few complaints.</p>
      <p>The second half, as it was against Villa, was less impressive, but in both instances were enough to earn a win. Wolves are clearly conserving energy and their success on the domestic and European front is a testament to that.</p>
      <p>But you really feel if Nuno’s men start putting 90 minute showings in they will be a side that every team in the division will fear.</p>

      <h3>Dendoncker makes it his own  </h3>
      <p>The news regarding Willy Boly’s long-term injury felt like a hammer blow when it broke just before the trip to Newcastle. The news that Wolves’ best defender faced months on the sideline threatened to derail their season before it really got started.</p>
      <p>But since then, Wolves have picked up eight points from a possible 12 in the league and Leander Dendoncker has looked at home in the back three.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article17307201.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_JS199447747.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Although Wolves have failed to keep a Premier League clean sheet since Boly’s injury, that is through little fault of Dendoncker.</p>
      <p>Since his switch he has probably been Wolves’ best defensive player. Rarely flustered and dominant in the tackle, Dendoncker has made it very difficult to envisage a back three without him.</p>
      <p>When Boly does return, the prospect of Dendoncker, Coady and Boly is a tantalising one and one that could be a vast improvement on last season’s chosen trio.</p>
