      <h1>Giants name new skipper after Amanda Farrugia announces retirement</h1>

      <h3>GWS captain Amanda Farrugia has announced her retirement just one day before her team was due to begin pre-season training.</h3>
      <p>Farrugia captained the Giants in every game over the first three seasons and was a key figure in GWS’ back line throughout the years.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old PE teacher will hang up the boots as a three-time AFL Sydney best and fairest winner.</p>
      <p>She only began playing the sport in her 20s as a way of keeping fit, but has left behind a legacy as the club’s inaugural skipper.</p>
      <p>“I’m incredibly honoured to have led this football club for three years and I’m grateful for the opportunity the AFL Women’s competition has afforded me,” Farrugia said.</p>
      <p>“This isn’t a competition you can do half-hearted and the time is right for me to make some time in my life for everything else.</p>

      <p>“I put everything I had physically and emotionally into my elite football career and I’m looking forward to the next chapter for me.”</p>
      <p>Giants AFLW coach Alan McConnell praised Farrugia for her rapid development during her time at the club.</p>
      <p>“For a young woman who grew up in Sydney with no connection to Australian rules football to be the first captain of our club is a phenomenal achievement,” McConnell said.</p>
      <p>“For all she’s achieved on the field, it’s the way she’s carried herself off the field that leaves a lasting legacy.</p>
      <p>“Her leadership has helped us set up an incredibly strong AFLW program at our club while the time she gives back to her community, fans and young girls everywhere is second to none.”</p>

      <p>Having served as vice-captain, GWS midfielder Alicia Eva will now take over as skipper of the club.</p>
      <p>“It’s an absolute honour,” Eva said.</p>
      <p>“I arrived at this club in the second season and it’s truly become my home. I’m so passionate about what we’re creating here.</p>
      <p>“‘Fridge’ leaves behind enormous shoes to fill and an incredible legacy, which we as a leadership group will look to carry on.”</p>
