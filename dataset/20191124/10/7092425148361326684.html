        <b>Almost 150 migrants have been rescued just off the Italian island of Lampedusa, with around 20 more still missing.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Italian Coast Guard released a <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/2019/1124/1094789-italy-migrants/">statement</a> on the operation saying that "The crews of four patrols rescued 143 people who had fallen into the sea" from a 10-metre boat as the migrants tried to navigate the Mediterranean.</p>
      <p>Those who survived have said that around 20 other migrants that had been present on the boat were still missing.</p>
      <p>Those that are still missing include the wives of two men who were rescued, an Eritrean man and a Libyan man.</p>

      <p>The search operation to find those still unaccounted for continued last night as the Italian police searched the island's coast in case some had managed to swim ashore.</p>
      <p>The Italian navy, along with two planes from Frontex, the agency for the EU's Schengen area for the border and coast guard, flew over the area to see if they could spot any of the missing migrants.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the European Commission has been asked to activate a migrant-relocation plan for those on board the Ocean Viking rescue ship by Germany, France, Malta and Italy.</p>
      <p>The ship, chartered by SOS Mediterranee with Doctors Without Borders, has managed to rescue 215 migrants in recent days.</p>
