      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/black-friday-headphones-deals-how-and-where-to-find-the-biggest-bargains">Black Friday</a> is here! OK, strictly speaking it's on 29 November, but who can wait til then? Not retailers, who've started knocking money off products now.</p>
      <p>And that means that products that might have been out of your reach are suddenly affordable. Like these Bang &amp; Olufsen Beoplay E8 earbuds, "probably the best-looking and most expensive wireless earphones on the market that you can buy right now," said our sister site <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/bo-beoplay-e8-wireless-earphones">TechRadar</a>.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-best-wireless-headphones-you-can-buy-right-now">bluetooth headphones</a> go, the Beoplay E8s are elegantly designed, far cooler than the ubiquitous Apple Airpods and now even cheaper.</p>

      <p>TechRadar's reviewer warned us about the four-hour battery life but added: "The touch controls are responsive, and we just can’t get over how gorgeous these things look. Yes, you’re going to be paying a higher price, but for this kind of premium finish and audio quality, it almost seems worth it." This is high-tech audio at a price that's within reach.</p>
