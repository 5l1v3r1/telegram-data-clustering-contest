      <h1>Munster boss Van Graan happy to move on after thrilling draw with Racing</h1>
      <h2>The Reds head coach acknowledged the result could have gone either way</h2>

      <p>Andrew Conway scored a late try but Munster could only salvage a draw from a thrilling Thomond Park clash.</p>
      <p>Reds head coach Johann Van Graan acknowledged the result could have gone either way.</p>
      <p>Racing looked well placed to become only the second French club in 32 attempts to win a Champions Cup match in Limerick when leading 21-14 inside the final 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>However, the late try from winger Conway, superbly converted from the touchline by fly-half JJ Hanrahan, ensured the tie.</p>
      <p>Hanrahan, who kicked 11 points in all, even had the chance to sneak an unlikely victory for the hosts at the death but his drop-goal attempt flew left and wide.</p>

      <p>The impressive French side scored three converted tries through talismanic No.10 Finn Russell, Teddy Thomas and Juan Imhoff, only for Munster – whose lone try was run in by Keith Earls close to half-time – to fight back.</p>
      <p>South African Van Graan said: “It was a very tough game of rugby, two heavyweight boxers who went at each other until literally the last second of the game.</p>
      <p>“I thought Racing started pretty well, we came back, we had that chance when we were five metres short about 10 minutes before <br/>half-time. We scored on the stroke of half-time and I thought we played some very good rugby in the first half.</p>
      <p>“There was a big breakdown battle, we fell behind in the second half, came back and I thought our bench made a big impact and we got ourselves back to 21-21 with that try and a brilliant conversion from JJ from the sideline.</p>
      <p>“We fought back with an incredible kick from Earlsy to get that lineout and then to keep punching in a drop-goal position and unfortunately it went to the left. If that goes over, it’s a different ball game.</p>
      <p>“All credit to Racing as well, I thought both teams came to play some very positive rugby. It is like last year’s draw in round one against Exeter – you could have lost it and you could have won it right there at the death. We will take our points and move on.”</p>

      <p>The result marked the third year in a row that Munster have recorded a win and a draw in their opening two pool fixtures.</p>
      <p>Both sides had to be satisfied with taking two points from the heavyweight clash before the back-to-back phase of Pool Four, with Munster locking horns with holders Saracens next month.</p>
      <p>The game was Simon Zebo’s first outing against his native Munster since his move to Racing in summer 2018. Playing at full-back against his former team, the Corkman enjoyed the occasion and felt a draw was the right result.</p>
      <p>Having been warmly received by the home crowd, Zebo told BT Sport: “The reception was incredible, as always. The Munster fans are up there with the best in the world. To come back here and play in the Racing colours, I was very proud.</p>
      <p>“It was a very close game so probably a deserved draw. We were a bit sloppy at times. It’s a very difficult place to come and be within such a grasp of winning the game so we did ourselves proud.</p>
      <p>“It was a huge result for us. The other teams in the group will find it difficult to come away from here with anything.”</p>
