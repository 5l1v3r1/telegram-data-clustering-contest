      <p>Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar has refused to rethink his decision to join hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and become the deputy chief minister, sources have told India Today TV.</p>
      <p>The Maharashtra deputy chief minister also told NCP leaders Jayant Patil and Dilip Walse Patil that tie-up with the BJP in the NCP's interests. NCP sharing power with the BJP is in its better interest, Ajit Pawar reportedly told the NCP leaders.</p>
      <p>The development has come hours after some of the NCP leaders, earlier in the day, claimed that Ajit Pawar may resign on Sunday evening as the MLAs who went with him are returning with party supremo Sharad Pawar.</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar was sworn in as the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra on Saturday. BJP's Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as the chief minister.</p>
