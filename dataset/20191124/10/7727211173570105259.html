      <p>A Liverpool musician says he has lost his “soulmate” after his cello of 34 years was stolen from his car.</p>
      <p>Gethyn Jones, 60, a member of the city's <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/royal-liverpool-philharmonic-orchestra">Royal Liverpool Philharmonic orchestra</a> , said he was “shattered” by the theft and has made a desperate plea for the instrument’s return.</p>
      <p>He told the ECHO: “I was just walking around the corner from where the Philharmonic is and you could tell there was no glass in my driver’s rear window.</p>
      <p>“I was just shattered. I almost went to my knees in shock.”</p>
      <p>Gethyn said he left the instrument for just half an hour in the car park closest to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/music/">city centre concert venue</a> , and compared it to a family treasure.</p>
      <p>He said: “To afford to buy it 34 years ago I sold everything I had. I don’t have another instrument. I don’t have a spare, I only have that.”</p>

      <p>While mass-produced cellos can be bought for as little as £200, the instruments used by professional musicians are extremely rare, handmade antiques.</p>
      <p>They are sold in a specialist market and musicians may try many different instruments before investing in one.</p>
      <p>Gethyn's cello was made by Colin Irving in 1977, number 72, and was last seen in a navy blue Gewa case.</p>
      <p>Gethyn, who has informed police, said: “It’s irreplaceable. I have had this cello for 34 years it is part of me. It is like I have lost my right arm. To find a cello that’s similar will take years of looking.</p>
      <p>“I am now 60 and the idea of finding anything to replace my best buddy is near impossible. Whoever has taken it has compromised my livelihood.</p>
      <p>“Not only that, it is emotional. When I make music with that cello it is a special thing. I have had it for 34 years.”</p>

      <p>As well as the cello, the thief took a bow which Gethyn says he has had for 39 years, made by Albin Hums.</p>
      <p>“It is like family treasure. It is like someone has stolen my great, great grandmother’s jewellery. And the thing is, [for] the person who stole it, it will be worthless to them because the police know about it.”</p>
      <p>Gethyn is now pleading with the thief to return the instrument to the Liverpool Philharmonic.</p>
      <p>He said: “Please give it back, drop it off at the Liverpool Philharmonic stage door. There will be no questions asked.”</p>
      <p>He added: “The monetary value of it is of no significance to me whatsoever. It’s my living my soulmate it is everything for me.</p>
      <p>“Whenever anything goes wrong I have always had my cello.”</p>
