      <h1>Jac Jossa's husband urgently begs I'm A Celeb fans to stop voting her for trials</h1>
      <h2>Dan Osborne has had enough of seeing his wife reduced to tears after she is repeatedly picked to compete in Bush Tucker Trials</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:02:06+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:02</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror .co.uk</a></address>
      <p>Dan Osborne has made a desperate appeal for I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! viewers to stop voting for his wife, Jacqueline Jossa, to compete in stomach churning Bush Tucker Trials.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dan-osborne">The 28-year-old former The Only Way Is Essex star</a> has backtracked after previously urging fans and viewers to nominate <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jacqueline-jossa">his 27-year-old wife</a> to take part in the trials.</p>
      <p>But after seeing Jac break down in tears at the mere thought of doing more trials, Dan has decided she’s already been through enough on the long running ITV reality show.</p>
      <p>After Saturday saw Jacqueline nominated once again to take part in a trial, Dan took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to tell fans to lay off his wife.</p>

      <p>“I know I said vote for Jac ‘cause she aint in there to change lightbulbs. I didn’t mean every single trial,” he stated as he addressed a camera.</p>
      <p>“Give her a break now. Come on!” he begged.</p>
      <p>Despite seeing his wife get upset, Dan insisted he was proud of the way she had confronted her fears and taken part in the trials she had been set so far.</p>

      <p>“But she keeps smashing ‘em all. She’ll worry about it, but she’ll smash it. She’ll keep proving everyone,” he said.</p>
      <p>He then suggested her upcoming trial should be her last.</p>
      <p>“Let her do this one, and then just give her a break, please,” he said.</p>

      <p>“She’s getting upset now. And it aint nice,” he continued.</p>
      <p>Dan once again repeated he had no doubt Jac would take the latest trial in her stride.</p>
      <p>“She’ll smash it. She’ll get all the stars, go back and have a nice dinner,” he said.</p>
