      <h1>Adam Forshaw comments on working under Marcelo Bielsa at Leeds United</h1>
      <h2>The Leeds United midfielder was speaking after his side defeated Luton Town 2-1 at the weekend.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:15:58+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United midfielder Adam Forshaw has shared what it is like working under the guidance of Marcelo Bielsa. </p>
      <p>The midfielder <a href="https://twitter.com/QuestTV/status/1198352138256166917">was speaking on EFL On Quest </a>when he was questioned on what it is like to work under the inspirational Argentine coach. </p>
      <p>Forshaw, who is currently out of the Leeds first-team picture with an injury, was effusive in his praise for the Leeds boss. </p>

      <p>He suggested that Bielsa has ‘transformed’ the club whilst also discussing the sometimes ruthless style of management which has seen Bielsa haul players off early in games. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“It’s brilliant. He has transformed the club…He’s a revelation.</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>“It’s a cliche but it is just the next game. We work on the shape for the next team that we come up against. You don’t want to look too far ahead we are taking it game by game.  </b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>“It doesn’t matter (when he changes tactics or players). It is not a criticism. At times he has taken players off on 25 minutes. It’s half-time a lot of the time. He just has 90 minutes to win a game of football. He’s not afraid to change it.”</b>
      </blockquote>

        <b>TBR’s View</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bielsa is certainly not afraid to make tough decisions for what he feels is the benefit of the team.</p>
      <p>In the past, he has even been known to sub off players who have come on when the dynamic of the game changes. </p>
      <p>This season he has stuck with Patrick Bamford up front despite growing pressure to play Eddie Nketiah and has not immediately turned to summer arrival Helder Costa for attacking impetus, highlighting how headstrong the Leeds manager can be. </p>
      <p>Forshaw’s current challenge will be getting back in the Leeds starting XI when he is back to fitness. Knowing Bielsa, there is certainly no guarantee he will be walking back into the team. </p>
