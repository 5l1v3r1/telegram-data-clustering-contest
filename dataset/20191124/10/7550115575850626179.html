        <b>Liverpool left it late to beat <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a> 2-1 on Saturday, as they continue to set a relentless pace in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> title race.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a>‘s men returned to action after the international break, as another dramatic afternoon unfolded at Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>A dull opening 45 minutes proved instantly forgettable, but <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/sadio-mane/">Sadio Mane</a> poked home shortly after the restart, scoring his 12th goal of the season.</p>
      <p>A below-par Reds performance looked to have been punished when Wilfried Zaha equalised late on, only for <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/roberto-firmino/">Roberto Firmino</a> to snatch the winner with five minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>The victory means Liverpool are still eight points clear at the top of the table, with Leicester sitting in second place.</p>
      <p>Here are five of the best statistics from Saturday’s win.</p>
      <h3>Incredible Unbeaten Run Continues</h3>

      <p>What Liverpool are achieving at the moment is no fluke whatsoever, with their never-say-attitude seeing them win endless matches late on.</p>
      <p>There is a winning mentality that simply didn’t exist prior to the last 18 months or so.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s victory means the Reds are now unbeaten in 30 games in the league, stretching back to January’s 2-1 defeat away to <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-city">Man City</a>.</p>
      <p>It means Klopp’s side have matched the third-longest undefeated run in <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> history, putting them alongside <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/arsenal">Arsenal</a> (December 2001-October 2002) and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-city">Man City</a> (April 2017-January 2018).</p>
      <p>They still have a way to go to reach the top two – <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/arsenal">Arsenal</a> (49, May 2003-October 2004) and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/chelsea">Chelsea</a> (40, October 2004-October 2005), but it is further proof of this team’s brilliance.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, Liverpool are now just one game away from matching the club’s all-time unbeaten league run of 31 matches.</p>
      <h3>Liverpool Mastering the 2-1 Victory</h3>

      <p>For all of Liverpool’s quality this season, they aren’t doing things the easy way.</p>
      <p>They have only won by more than one goal in the league once since beating Newcastle 3-1 at Anfield in September – the win over City by the same scoreline.</p>
      <p>There have been few signs of resounding victories, admittedly in a difficult run, and it is the Reds’ ability to win 2-1 that has caught the eye.</p>
      <p>The triumph over Palace was the sixth time they have won by that scoreline this season, according to analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/BassTunedToRed/status/1198283955168055297?s=20">Andrew Beasley</a>.</p>
      <p>The only seasons in which it happened more in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> were 1993/94 and 2004/05, both of which occurred on seven occasions.</p>
      <p>There’s still 25 games to go!</p>
      <h3>Non-Big-Six Conquerors</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>There was a time when Liverpool used to be fragile when facing weaker teams, often raising their game in the bigger matches.</p>
      <p>Times have changed, however, and they have put together an extraordinary run against non-big-six sides – something that is so easy to take for granted.</p>
      <p>Since the beginning of last season, Liverpool have won 33 of their 36 matches against them, drawing the other three and remaining unbeaten.</p>
      <p>Their ability to manage games even when not playing well, eventually breaking down the opposition, is a huge reason for their current success.</p>
      <p>To only lose once against one of the so-called lesser outfits since way back in April 2017 – Swansea away in January 2018 – is staggering.</p>
      <h3>Robertson the Assist Machine</h3>
      <figure>

      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/andrew-robertson/">Andy Robertson</a> has been a remarkable signing since arriving from Hull, with the Scot now considered by many as the world’s premier left-back.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old wasn’t actually at his best on Saturday, but he still made a key impact in Liverpool’s priceless win.</p>
      <p>Robertson teed-up Mane to score the opener, meaning he has picked up 13 assists in the league in 2019, which is more than any other player.</p>
      <p>Six goal contributions in 13 league matches is a strong ratio for any player, but to do it from left-back speaks volumes about what a special talent Robertson is.</p>
      <p>Moreover, since the start of last season no other player has provided more league assists than Robertson (16), a total matched only by <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>‘s Ryan Fraser.</p>
      <p>He now has 23 assists for Liverpool – only Firmino, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/trent-alexander-arnold/">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/james-milner/">James Milner</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/mohamed-salah/">Mohamed Salah</a> have more under Klopp.</p>
      <h3>Lack of Clean Sheets a Worry?</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Taking any kind of negative stance at the moment feels wrong, but it would be naive to pretend that everything Liverpool are doing is perfect.</p>
      <p>The league leaders never looked entirely convincing at the back against Palace, with the hosts creating opportunities and eventually netting thanks to Zaha’s strike.</p>
      <p>It means the Reds haven’t earned a clean sheet in any competition since winning 1-0 at Sheffield United on September 28.</p>
      <p>That’s a run of 10 games – at this stage in the league last season they had let in six goals fewer.</p>
      <p>In fairness, 11 goals conceded in 13 outings does still represent a solid record in 2019/20, but Liverpool aren’t quite as solid as they were.</p>
