      <h3>SENATOR Bong Revilla expressed his commitment to curb the rising rate of obesity in the Philippines, especially among the youth, by including more physical activities and traditional games in the K to 12 curriculum.</h3>
      <p>He filed S. No. 1121, “An Act Providing for the Mandatory Inclusion of Anti-Obesity Education Program and Exercise including Play and Traditional Games, in the Pre-School, Elementary and High School Curricula, Both in Public and Private Schools and Educational Institutions,” believing that the awareness, appreciation and responsibility of a person to his own health should start at a young age to build a strong foundation of healthy lifestyle and to encourage prevention of illnesses.</p>
      <p>Based on the 8th National Nutrition Survey conducted from June 2013 to April 2014 by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FMRI), 5 percent of children aged 0-5 and 8.3 percent of kids aged 10-19 are overweight. On the other hand, a stunning 31.1 % of adults are suffering from clinical obesity.</p>
      <p>The study further revealed that the prevalence rate of being overweight and obese among children 0-5 years old rises at an average of 0.17 percent annually for the past 24 years. Meanwhile, the overweight prevalence of among school-age and adolescent groups increases at 0.33 percent and 0.34 percent respectively in a span of 10 years.</p>
      <p>If passed into law, Bong Revilla’s bill shall mandate the Department of Education (DepEd) to craft specially-designed instructions to inculcate anti-obesity measures as an integral part of the learning schedule, and target the physical health requirements of the students in every age bracket.</p>
      <p>“Dahil sa pagtaas ng overweight at obesity rate sa bansa, marami sa ating mga kababayan ay parang naglalakad na ‘time bomb’ dahil anumang oras, maaari nilang ikapahamak ang anumang komplikasyon sa kalusugan na dulot ng sobrang timbang. Hindi na natin dapat pang hintayin ang araw na iyon. Dapat ngayon pa lang, we should promote an active lifestyle among our youth para mapangalagaan sila,” Revilla said.</p>
