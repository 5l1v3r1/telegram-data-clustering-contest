      <p>The Hoops welcomed several of Jim Gavin’s stars onto the Celtic Park pitch at half-time as the stadium announcer praised the historic achievement.</p>
      <p>The Dubs etched their names into GAA history in September after it took a replay to separate themselves and Kerry in the All-Ireland decider — but Dublin prevailed to get their hands on the Sam Maguire Cup for the fifth consecutive year.</p>
      <p>Jack McCaffrey, Brian Fenton, Niall Scully and Paddy Andrews were among those who travelled to Glasgow yesterday, where they presented Celtic with a signed Sky Blues<b> </b>jersey to help with the club’s annual Christmas appeal after receiving a warm reception.</p>
