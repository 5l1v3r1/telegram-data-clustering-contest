        <b>BBC Presenter Justin Webb has revealed how guilty he felt about being in America focusing on himself while his mother became old and ill.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 58-year-old admits he thought his career and children were more worthy of his ‘time and attention’ when his mother Gloria started showing signs of dementia.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Mum said she wanted to taste champagne again before she died. “Good plan,” I responded. But I was busy.</p>
      <p>‘I was living abroad and had young children who seemed more urgently in need of my time and attention.</p>
      <p>‘We did buy the bottle, but ended up drinking it with her best friend after we had scattered her ashes in a field near where she lived.’</p>
      <p>His mum had gone from a life of merry independency while Justin focused on growing his career in America at the BBC.</p>

      <p>However, she later slowed down and ended up having primary biliary cirrhosis, an auto-immune disease that slowly destroys the liver.</p>

      <p>‘Now, years later, as I look ahead to later life myself, I think back to those months and wish it had been different for her and for me,’ Justin continued.</p>
      <p>It took no longer caring about his career and his achievements to realise that severity of her dementia and old age.</p>
      <p>The presenter explained: ‘I was her main reason for living. But one morning in the summer that she died, I came back to her flat and found that the radio had not been moved to be near her ear in the morning.</p>
      <p>‘She had stopped caring about the show and about me, the thing she had cared about more than anything else.</p>
      <p>‘Let me be blunt. This should have been the moment she died. Better for her and better for her family.’</p>
      <p>His mother died in 2006.</p>
      <p>‘I should not have been in America when Mum was ill,’ Justin said. ‘I should have come home. Did she not tailor her life to care for me when I was young? Of course she did, yet when her time came, I did not.’</p>
