      <h1>Scotland dismissed by Serbia captain Dusan Tadic as he predicts Euro 2020 qualification path</h1>
      <h2>The former Southampton star reckons Scotland and Israel are unlikely to qualify for the big one.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:05:43+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:05</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Walker</a></address>
      <p>Ajax and Serbia captain Dusan Tadic reckons it doesn't matter who wins between <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> and Israel in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> play-off semi final because they would both lose in the final anyway.</p>
      <p>Scotland were drawn to face the Israelis at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hampden-park">Hampden</a> last week with the game in March. The winner will face either Norway or Serbia in Oslo or Belgrade.</p>
      <p>But former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> midfielder Tadic reckons Scotland and Israel are wasting their time.</p>
      <p>He said: "There's no doubt that Norway away is the toughest draw we could get.</p>
      <p>"I think if you look at it, ourselves and Norway are clearly the two strongest teams in our section.</p>
      <p>"I would expect whoever wins between Serbia and Norway will qualify.</p>
      <p>"To be honest I have not even thought about who I would prefer to play between Scotland and Israel because I am only concentrating on our game in Norway.</p>
      <p>"Norway play at least 40 per cent better at home than they do away. They also have a couple of quality players and we will have to take them very seriously indeed."</p>
