      <p>Black Future ’88 is a Synth-Punk roguelike 2D action Shooter that came out two days ago. Good Shepherd Entertainment and SUPERSCARYSNAKES were kind enough to provide us with three keys for a giveaway, so here we go.</p>
      <p>As said, Black Future ’88 is a Synth-Punk roguelike 2D action Shooter. Players will vertically climb an always evolving procedural tower to reach the top and kill its insane owner. Players can also shoot, slash, dash and upgrade themselves to survive the endless waves of deadly traps, homicidal AI, crazed junkies and colossal Wardens standing in their way.</p>

      <p>Best of luck to everyone!</p>
