The SC will hear the petition filed by Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress, challenging the Maharashtra government’s decision to invite Devendra Fadnavis for government formation in the state at 11:30 AM on Sunday. As per sources, Congress leader Kapil Sibal will represent the Sena-Cong-NCP in front of the three-judge bench comprising Justice NV Ramana, Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice Sanjiv Khanna. The parties have contended that they should have been invited to form the government owing to their constituting a majority in the Assembly and are demanding immediate floor test.</p>
