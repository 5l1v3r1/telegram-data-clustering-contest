      <p>Pope Francis rode in a carbon-free popemobile at his mass in Nagasaki, an appropriate choice in line with his environmental concerns.</p>
      <p>Francis used a Toyota hydrogen-powered Mirai, customised with a stand and handrails.</p>
      <p>He will use a similar model while in Tokyo.</p>

      <p>The pope held a big mass at a Nagasaki city baseball stadium.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Sunday, he demanded world leaders renounce atomic weapons and the Cold War-era doctrine of deterrence, and paid respects at a memorial for the 26 martyrs.</p>
      <p>Environmental protection is one of Francisâ€™ key agenda items and is also part of the theme of his Japan visit.</p>
