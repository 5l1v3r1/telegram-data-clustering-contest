      <h1>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admits January spending spree is unlikely</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/"><b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b></a> has admitted that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> are unlikely to splash out on players over the January transfer window.</h2>

      <p>The Red Devils are intent on signing a striker when the window opens, with Red Bull Salzburg's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/erling-braut-haaland/"><b>Erling Braut Haaland</b></a> emerging as the club's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/man-utd-madrid-quoted-gbp85m-for-haaland_379504.html">top target</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/news/juventus-confirm-mandzukic-exit-talks-amid-man-utd-links_375972.html?t1571848805">Reports suggested</a> that a deal for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mario-mandzukic/"><b>Mario Mandzukic</b></a> was in the offing, although it seems as if United have recently pulled out of the move.</p>
      <p>Speaking about January transfers on Saturday, Solskjaer told <i>The Telegraph</i>: "It is not about 'x' amount of money [we have to spend], it is about who do we think will be good for the club in the long-term, not just three or four months.</p>
      <p>"Probably not because that is the thing - it is in January. Not many clubs want to sell players that they would otherwise want to keep in January.</p>
      <p>"Maybe one or two could be a loan deal but that is not a big money thing, it is just to help the team. But we are getting players back and we are looking at what can be available for us."</p>
      <p>United's pursuit of Haaland took a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/leipzig-to-beat-man-utd-to-haaland-for-cut-price-fee_380330.html">major blow</a> this week after it was reported that RB Leipzig have the chance to sign the 19-year-old for a cut-price of Â£25.7m next summer.</p>
      <p>The Premier League club has also reportedly targeted <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-maddison/"><b>James Maddison</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jadon-sancho/"><b>Jadon Sancho</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/timo-werner/"><b>Timo Werner</b></a> ahead of the upcoming window.</p>
