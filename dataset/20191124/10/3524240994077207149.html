      <p>The Federal Government says as the nation heads into year 2020, “the successful commercialisation of the Creative industry” will be its number one priority.</p>
      <p>The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, disclosed this in Lagos at the 6th All Africa Music Awards (AFRIMA)</p>
      <p>AFRIMA is an annual awards event established by the International Committee of AFRIMA in collaboration with African Union to reward and celebrate musical works, talents and creativity around the continent.</p>
      <p>The minister said creative industry commercialisation would create jobs, reduce crime, be a major source of foreign exchange and reduce the nation’s dependence on oil.</p>
      <p>Mohammed added that it would rebrand the country internationally and boost Gross Domestic Product.</p>
      <p>“We in government are tackling all impediments to the industry from thriving.</p>
      <p>“We are making cheaper and longer term financing available for the industry, especially for infrastructural projects, like Concert halls across the six geo-political zones of the country.</p>
      <p>“This was recently announced by the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“The collecting society issues that have plagued collective administrations have now been put on the front burner by the Attorney General.</p>
      <p>“People who use music must pay for it, no more excuses,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mohammed said that the government would also pay prioritise the commercialisation of the digital economy.</p>
      <p>He said that besides making data cheaper, it would ensure that owners of content make more money from the use of their works.</p>
      <p>Mohammed said government would clean up the advertising industry and ensure that proper measurement of content exist and are collated.</p>
      <p>This promises to add at least N50bn annually to the Creative Sector,” he said.</p>
      <p>He assured that government would continue to play its role in making sure the business of music works for those who engage in it.</p>
      <p>The minister welcomed participants and critical stakeholders in the entertainment industry across Africa that gathered at the event.</p>
      <p>He congratulated the organisers of AFRIMA on another successful hosting of the prestigious awards as well as all nominees and awardees.</p>
      <p>“A lot goes into making an industry.</p>
      <p>“For the Creative industry, it is the artistes, the managers, platforms, agents, marketers, investors and of course the event organisers, which include Award events and concerts.</p>
      <p>“So, thank you, AFRIMA, for playing your role in the explosion, development and success of first, our Afrobeat, and African Music in general,” he said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Head of Culture, Africa Union Commission, Angela Martins expressed gratitude to Nigeria for playing host to the continental event.</p>
      <p>She said AFRIMA aimed at bringing Africans together, celebrate the continent’s heritage and commemorate Africa talents.</p>
      <p>Speaking in the same vein, the President of AFRIMA, Mike Dada said that the annual event also aimed at removing the negative narrations of poverty and joblessness from Africa.</p>
