      <p>Cape Town â€“ On Saturday night <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10409561/justin-timberlake-holds-hands-alisha-wainwright-strokes-knee-boozy/"><b>The Sun</b></a> published photographs of what appeared to be Justin Timberlake cosying up to actress, Alisha Wainwright.</p>
      <p>The two were photographed holding hands while on a night out; in another photograph, Alisha rested her hand on the <i>Can't Stop The Feeling!</i> singer's leg.</p>
      <p>An insider told <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1096520/there-s-nothing-going-on-between-justin-timberlake-and-alisha-wainwright-despite-hand-holding-sources-say"><b>E! News</b></a> though that the two weren't alone and it was all "completely innocent".</p>
      <p>"They were out with all the cast, crew, makeup artists, and everyone was just hanging out in a social setting," the source shared, as Justin and Alisha are currently shooting the film <i>Palmer</i> in New Orleans. "They are just working together. No validity to any other rumour other than that they are filming together."</p>
      <p>Another source said the same. "They're filming a movie together, and it was a group of people hanging out. There is nothing going on between them."</p>
      <p>Justin has been married to Jessica Biel since 2012 and shares 4-year-old Silas together.</p>
      <p>Justin just recently opened up about his unbreakable bond with <i>The Sinner</i> actress, reports <a href="https://people.com/music/justin-timberlake-alisha-wainwright-holding-hands-new-orleans-completely-innocent-says-source/"><b>People</b></a>.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.etonline.com/justin-timberlake-talks-finding-that-person-in-wife-jessica-biel-exclusive-134304"><b>Entertainment Tonight</b></a> in October, "It's like, once you find that person, it's like a baptism, where you're like, 'I can't go back,' you know what I mean? Like, I don't, I can't go back.</p>
      <p>"I'm just enjoying the ride," he said.</p>
