      <p>The relationship between Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane and Gareth Bale has not been rosy this season and the club are not considering allowing him leave.</p>
      <p>The report added that Gareth Bale himself is ready to leave Real Madrid next year and could make a return to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid are also believed to use Gareth Bale to tempt Manchester United giving them France international Paul Pogba.</p>
      <p>Paul Pogba's future is also uncertain at Manchester United after claiming that he would be glad to play under fellow countryman Zinedine Zidane.</p>
      <p>Earlier, <b>Legit.ng</b> had reported how former Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan made it clear that he does not believe that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can operate at the required level that <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1256247-solskjaer-told-by-simon-jordan-boss-manchester-united.html">is expected from a Man United coach.</a></p>
      <p>Last year when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer replaced Mourinho at Old Trafford, he started well, as he went some games unbeaten but United ended up without a trophy.</p>
