      <h1>How One Singer Is Taking On Censorship In Uzbekistan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:37:55+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:37</time> by <a rel="author">Shukhrat Bobojon, Farangis Najibullah</a></address>
      <p>The latest music video by popular Uzbek singer Lola Yuldosheva has been hailed by many critics and fans as a “social protest” and “revolutionary” for criticizing censorship in her native Uzbekistan.<br/><br/>The video, Sevgingni Menga Ait (Tell Me About Your Love), depicts Yuldosheva as a singer who performs in front of a two-person panel in order to get the mandatory license needed by singers and musicians in Uzbekistan.</p>
      <p>Accompanied by two backup singers, Lola sports a Western-style outfit that includes a pair of over-the-knee boots, a wide-brimmed hat, dark shades, and a long, wide coat.<br/><br/>Before she performs, a panel member reminds her that officials must ensure that artists in Uzbekistan “observe national traditions,” a term frequently used by officials in charge of issuing licenses.</p>
      <p>The clip shows the singer presenting her song and being interrupted by the panel, seemingly unhappy with her clothing.<br/><br/>“Sorry, but we have our own Uzbek traditions and clothes,” an official in the video tells Lola. “What does that hat signify? Your European-style clothes don’t match our national mentality.”<br/><br/>The official goes on to say that Uzbeks shouldn’t forget their “own traditions,” as her colleague claps in agreement.</p>

        <b>Under Scrutiny</b>
      </p>
      <p>The artist sings her song again after swapping her hat with a wig and replacing her female backup singers with two male musicians, one clad in a white shirt, the other, a suit and tie.<br/><br/>Uzbek authorities routinely scrutinize a musician’s lyrics, outfit, and hairstyle when they need to receive or renew the license each one needs in order to perform in Uzbekistan.<br/><br/>Fall afoul of the panel and all opportunities to play concerts or perform at events are over.</p>
      <p>One popular male singer, Sanjar Javberdiev (better known as San Jay), <b><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/uzbek-singer-san-jay-beard-performance-ban-tv-urges-president-mirziyoev/30218363.html">complained he wasn’t able to perform at public events</a></b> because of his beard, appealing to President Shavkat Mirziyoev for permission.</p>

      <p>Several female artists have been disqualified from getting a license after their dresses were deemed too revealing and immodest.<br/><br/>Yuldosheva’s new music video was praised by Uzbek film producer Abdulaziz Mahmudov, who described it as a deeply “meaningful clip that...reflects how art is treated” in Uzbekistan.<br/><br/>"The government tries to insert whatever it wants inside people’s minds, but it’s impossible to change people’s mindset with force and through censorship," Mahmudov told RFE/RL.<br/><br/>“There are many so-called morality guardians everywhere in our country, especially in Uzbekkonsert and Uzbekkino [the bodies overseeing Uzbekistan’s music and cinema industries, respectively]. These guardians in fact present censorship,” Mahmudov said.<br/><br/>Prominent Uzbek blogger Nurbek Alimov hailed the music video as a “revolution by Lola” and hailed the singer’s impressive “bravery.”<br/><br/>Yuldosheva demonstrated that “everybody has the right to push their boundaries, to wear what they want, and to choose the style they like,” Alimov said.<br/><br/>Officials, however, were unimpressed.<br/><br/>Mavluda Askarkhujaeva, the head of the Culture Ministry’s press office, insisted that “all clips, all music and songs must adhere to the Uzbek mentality.”<br/><br/>In March 2015, Yuldosheva got an <b><a href="https://www.ozodlik.org/a/26915800.html">official warning</a></b> over a dress she wore during a concert in Tashkent. Authorities decided that the red dress -- which exposed her legs -- “conflicted with the national mentality.”</p>

      <p>At the same time, officials warned female singers across the country not to appear “half naked” in concerts and not make any sexually suggestive moves on stage.</p>
