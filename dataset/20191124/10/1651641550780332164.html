      <h1>It’s time to see what Twitter thinks you are into</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:21:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:21</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://mspoweruser.com/tag/twitter/">Twitter</a> has made it increasingly difficult to use 3rd party clients for your news feed, meaning it is also more difficult to avoid their personalized algorithm and ads.</p>
      <p>If there is one thing worse than a personalized news feed it is one that is personalized badly, based on an incorrect understanding of your interests.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, Twitter does let you see your twitter interest list and view what it thinks you are interested in, simply by visiting:</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data/twitter_interests/interest">twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data/twitter_interests/interest</a> .</p>
      <p>The data appears to consist largely of items you may have searched for or liked, but also includes some pretty odd deductions by twitter’s AI (no, I’m not a fan of Pre or Post Malone).</p>
      <p>Fortunately, Twitter allows you to easily edit the list and remove (though not add) items from the list.</p>
      <p>In any case,  see your twitter interest list and clean up your interests today and by visiting your page <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data/twitter_interests/interest">at twitter here</a>.</p>
      <p>To do the same on <b>Google</b>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/">Google Account</a>.</li>
        <li>On the left navigation panel, click <b>Data &amp; personalization</b>.</li>
        <li>On the <i>Ad personalization panel</i>, click <b>Go to ad settings</b>.</li>
        <li>Turn on <b>Ad Personalization</b> if it’s off.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Under “How your ads are personalized,” select your personal info or interests.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To update your info, select <b>Update</b>. Follow the steps on the screen.</li>
            <li>To remove an interest, select <b>Turn off</b>. Confirm by selecting <b>Turn off</b>.</li>
            <li>To bring back an interest, select <b>What you’ve turned off</b>. Choose an interest and select <b>Turn back on</b>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Lastly, for <b>Facebook</b>, go to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences">www.facebook.com/ads/preferences</a> .</p>
