      <h2>'It was the same as scoring a goal and running past the away end while giving them the bird'- Collymore's verdict</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:48:29+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:48</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Abbandonato</a></address>
      <p>Football pundit Stan Collymore has told Gareth Bale he was right to 'stick it' to Real Madrid and their fans with his Wales flag celebrations.</p>
      <p>The Welsh captain was <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wales-gareth-bale-real-madrid-17307285">booed again at the Bernabeu</a> as he came on as a substitute in Real's 3-1 La Liga triumph over Real Sociedad on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>It was the first time Bale was seen in public in Spain since the Cardiff City Stadium celebrations at the end of Wales' 2-0 win over Hungary which saw Ryan Giggs' side march to the Euro 2020 finals.</p>
      <p>Tensions have arisen over Bale and his team-mates holding up the 'Wales. Golf. Madrid. In That Order' banner, with an eruption of fury back in Madrid.</p>
      <p>Those spilled over as Bale entered the fray to a chorus of jeers when he replaced Brazilian ace Rodrygo in the 66th minute against Sociedad and helped set up Real's third goal.</p>
      <p>Real fans even held up a banner of their own which read 'Rodrygo. Vini. Lucas. Bale. In That Order'.</p>

      <p>That was a reference to them insisting Zinidine Zidane should place Bale behind the Brazilian duo of Rodrygo and Vinicius, as well as Spain's Lucas Vazquez when it comes to who should play alongside Eden Hazard and Karim Benzema in the Madrid forward line.</p>
      <p>But former Liverpool striker Collymore is 100 per cent in Bale's corner over the row, delivering a robust defence of the Wales superstar in his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-utd-should-sack-ole-20948567">column for the Sunday Mirror</a> .</p>
      <p>He wrote: "I love the fact Gareth stuck it to Real Madrid and the Madridistas by celebrating Wales’ Euro 2020 qualification success with a banner.</p>
      <p>"It was the same as scoring a goal and running past the away end while giving them the bird.</p>
      <p>"He has been dealt with appallingly by Real and Zidane, who should know better after his own experiences as a player.</p>
      <p>"Had Zidane and Real treated Bale anywhere near what his status in the game deserves, then he wouldn’t have felt the need to do it.</p>
      <p>"I mean, come on, he is hardly a revolutionary or one for making outrageous, impassioned statements, is he?</p>
      <p>"So the fact that he wanted to make his point so animatedly probably tells you more about the way Real have treated him than the way he has treated them.</p>
      <p>"Bale has delivered big goals in big games and trophies for the Spanish club – and yet they have still given him no respect whatsoever.</p>
      <p>"It should be a case of 'Wales. Golf. And get yourself back home'."</p>

      <p>Bale's future in Spain does appear to be on the line, with Jose Mourinho set to swoop to bring him back to Tottenham in January.</p>
      <p>An exasperated Zidane again had to deal with the Bale issue following his team's win over Sociedad, saying: "There is too much noise with Bale, he wants to be here and do as well as he can, that's why we don't want to talk too much about this.</p>
      <p>"I hope this doesn't continue throughout the season. We want the fans to be with us from the start of the game to the end but we can't control this.</p>
      <p>"The fans have the right to do what they want but I ask them to support everyone.</p>
      <p>"I have not spoken to him about the jeers, I have only congratulated him.</p>

      <p>"I can't tell you if it's unfair or not. Everyone can say what they want. We need our fans, then we can't control what happens.</p>
      <p>"Real Madrid supporters have booed all of the very best players and Bale put in a good display when he came on. He just needs to focus on working hard on the pitch.</p>
      <p>"It's not about whether I understand the boos or not, we need our fans on our side and so does Gareth, just like every other player.</p>
      <p>"If that happens we can move on from this. We want the fans to applaud him, like they did after the third goal."</p>
