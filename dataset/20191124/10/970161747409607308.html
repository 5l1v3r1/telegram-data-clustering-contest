      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/eddie-hearn/">Eddie Hearn</a> aimed a dig at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/deontay-wilder/">Deontay Wilder</a> for his tepid call-out of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/anthony-joshua/">Anthony Joshua</a> after his win over Luis Ortiz.</p>
      <p>The WBC champion <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/deontay-wilder-pulls-off-stunning-comeback-scorecards-revealed-luis-ortiz-rematch-11208296/">successfully defended his title in Las Vegas on Saturday night</a>, knocking Ortiz out in the seventh round.</p>
      <p>Wilder said after his victory he would fight <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tyson-fury/">Tyson Fury</a> next before <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/deontay-wilder-tyson-fury-ko-knockout-rematch-luis-ortiz-fight-boxing-11208276/">pursuing a unification fight with the winner of Joshua’s rematch</a> with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/andy-ruiz-jr/">Andy Ruiz Jr</a>.</p>
      <p>The American has repeatedly said he wants Ruiz Jr to win the rematch and Hearn teased Wilder for avoiding saying Joshua’s name after his latest victory.</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6BMHYosSLk">IFL TV</a>: ‘He struggled to say it, didn’t he? “I want the winner of ….Ruiz and the other guy”.</p>
      <p>‘As refreshing as it is in a long time, what’s next after Andy Ruiz is totally irrelevant right now.</p>

      <p>‘It’s just about trying to beat Andy Ruiz. I think Joshua against Wilder is the most thrilling fight in world boxing.</p>
      <p>‘Both guys have been hurt before, both guys punch hard and both guys are fast. It’s all irrelevant unless Joshua can beat Andy Ruiz.’</p>
      <p>Wilder and Joshua blamed each other for their unification fight falling through in 2018 before the British heavyweight lost his titles to Ruiz Jr last June.</p>

      <p>The failure to agree terms with Joshua pushed Wilder towards Fury, but Hearn insists the Bronze Bomber is vulnerable.</p>
      <p>‘That’s why the division is so exciting. You can have any fight going any way you want,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘[Wilder is] very, very limited as a fighter skill wise, but he has this freakish power that can turn your lights off at any time.</p>
      <p>‘That’s why he’s so exciting, Deontay Wilder. He’s vulnerable, he can get beaten by anybody, but if he hits you on the chin, you’re bang in trouble.’</p>
