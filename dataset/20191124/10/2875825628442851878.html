      <h1>Flamengo boss Jorge Jesus sends warning to Liverpool ahead of Club World Cup</h1>
      <h2>The Brazilian side came from behind to win a remarkable match against River Plate on Saturday, and could now come face-to-face with Jurgen Klopp's European Champions in Qatar</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:18:08+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:18</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Flamengo boss Jorge Jesus has warned Liverpool not to take the new South American champions lightly should they meet them in Qatar next month.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian side <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/flamengo-win-copa-libertadores-dramatic-20947306">came from a goal down to beat River Plate 2-1</a> in a thrilling Copa Libertadores final on Saturday night, earning them a place in next month's Club World Cup.</p>
      <p>An early strike from Rafael Santos Borre looked as though it was going to secure the trophy for the Argentineans, only for Gabriel Barbosa to score in the 89th minute and then again in stoppage time to complete the turnaround.</p>
      <p>Barbosa and River's Exequiel Palacios were then both sent off in the dying moments of an eventful contest, and former Benfica and Sporting Lisbon boss Jesus couldn't help but compare the quality of the match to June's rather more prosaic Champions League final, in which Liverpool beat Tottenham 2-0.</p>

      <p>"This final has been seen by 186 countries in the world, by millions and millions, and whoever saw it will realise the level it had," Jesus told reporters after the match.</p>
      <p>"(Compared to) the last Champions League final between <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> , this one had more technical, tactical content, and a much more beautiful colour than this final in Madrid, where I saw it live."</p>
      <p>Both Flamengo and Liverpool will have to win a semi-final before facing each other in a potential final next month, with the Reds aiming to win the trophy for the first time in their history.</p>

      <p>"We will be in Qatar to play against Liverpool if they are a finalist," added Jesus. "And we still have to play two games.</p>
      <p>"We have a team to win this trophy."</p>
      <p>Liverpool's semi-final will take place on December 18, with Flamengo's a day earlier.</p>
