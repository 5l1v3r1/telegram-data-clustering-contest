      <p>Three people said to be sponsors of those that blocked Sabo Road, Ile Ife on Saturday during a protest have been arrested by the police.</p>
      <p>Osun State Police Commissioner, Abiodun Ige, confirmed their arrest in a chat.</p>
      <p>Some northerners had blocked the busy Sabo Road, while protesting against plans to install a candidate as Seriki Hausawa.</p>
      <p>The development caused panic in the area before the situation was brought under control by the police.</p>
      <p>According to findings, three people were eyeing the stool of Seriki after the demise of the last occupant of the seat.</p>
      <p>However, protesters that blocked the road were said to be protesting against plan to install a candidate said to be unpopular.</p>
      <p>According to residents of Sabo, during the period that the road was barricaded, commuters passing through the area very early on Saturday had hectic time.</p>
      <p>Policemen deployed to the scene, however, dismantled the barricade and arrested those suspected to be masterminds of the incident.</p>
