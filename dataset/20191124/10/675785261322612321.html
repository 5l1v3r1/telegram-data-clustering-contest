      <h2>Sana Muhammad's ex-husband Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo burst out of a garden shed and shot her in the heart as she ran upstairs and her husband Imtiaz fled into their London street</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:36:30+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:36</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/, Emily Pennink</a></address>
      <p>The devastated widower of a pregnant mum who was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/murder">murdered</a> with a crossbow says he feels guilty over his failure to save her.</p>
      <p>Sana Muhammad, 35, died when her ex-husband, Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo, 51, burst out of a garden shed and shot her with an 18in bolt that pierced her heart.</p>
      <p>Mrs Muhammad was eight months pregnant with her six child, a son who was delivered by Caesarean section and miraculously survived after the bolt missed him by millimetres.</p>
      <p>Her widower, Imtiaz Muhammad, has tearfully described her final moments and his regret after he came face-to-face with the killer, who had a cold smile, and ran into their London street.</p>

      <p>Mr Muhammad said Unmathallegadoo pointed the loaded crossbow at his throat after he found his wife's ex hiding in his garden shed.</p>
      <p>He told the Mail on Sunday he fled through the house and out the front door into the street, and screamed at his wife to follow him.</p>
      <p>She ran upstairs towards her children and was shot at close range as Unmathallegadoo ran after her.</p>

      <p>Speaking for the first time, Mr Muhammad relived the horrifying incident and what he possibly could have done differently.</p>
      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7718569/Haunted-guilt-Husband-fled-left-wife-mercy-crossbow-killer-reveals-regret.html">Mail on Sunday</a> that his wife's killer was jealous that they were living a happy life together.</p>
      <p>He added: "If at any stage I could have stood up to him, I could have saved Sana.</p>
      <p>"If I only closed the kitchen door behind me, then she would have been saved. Or if I just spoke to Ram, maybe she could have been saved. My mind, my brain didn’t work that time.</p>

      <p>"That’s the regret I am living with, that’s why I went into depression afterwards. It’s the biggest regret of my life. She was my soulmate. She was everything to me, she was my companion, she was my friend. Life was so lovely."</p>
      <p>He is now a single father to six children, including the son who survived.</p>
      <p>Unmathallegadoo was armed with two crossbows, bolts, a knife, duct tape, cable ties and a hammer as he hid inside the garden shed.</p>
      <p>He was found guilty of murder by a jury at the Old Bailey on Friday. He will be sentenced this week.</p>

      <p>Jurors had heard how the victim had an arranged marriage to the defendant in Mauritius on her 16th birthday.</p>
      <p>He was 30 at the time, nearly twice her age.</p>
      <p>Their unhappy relationship ended in 2012 after an incident in which she jumped out of an upstairs window and broke her ankle.</p>
      <p>She had told police the defendant had stared at her as he sharpened knives in the garden.</p>

      <p>After a trial in 2013, he was cleared of attacking her and acquitted on the judge's direction of a charge of attempted strangulation under the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861.</p>
      <p>The victim successfully filed for an emergency non-molestation order which barred the defendant from coming within 100 metres of the family home in Ilford, east London.</p>
      <p>Under the order, which was still in place at the time of the killing, Unmathallegadoo was forbidden from contacting his ex-wife directly and was not to threaten or intimidate her or their three children.</p>
      <p>Following her divorce, she married builder Mr Muhammad and changed her name. She was formerly known as formerly known as Devi Unmathallegadoo.</p>
      <p>The couple went on to have two children together and were eagerly awaiting the imminent arrival of their third last autumn.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the defendant did not react well to his divorce.</p>
      <p>He lost his job as a site manager at Newham General Hospital and slept rough as he plotted his revenge.</p>

      <p>He bought two crossbows online for around £250 each which were discovered stashed near his ex-wife's home by a neighbour in March 2018.</p>
      <p>After they were removed, Unmathallegadoo set about replacing them, and organised surveillance on the house.</p>
      <p>On the morning of November 12 2018, he took up position in the garden shed armed with two crossbows, bolts, a knife, duct tape, cable ties and a hammer.</p>
      <p>He was disturbed by Mr Muhammad, who had gone into the garden to store an empty box while his wife prepared food for a dinner party that evening.</p>

      <p>Giving evidence from behind a screen, Mr Muhammad told jurors he thought he was "dreaming" when his wife's ex-husband emerged armed with two loaded crossbows.</p>
      <p>He called for his wife to run as he was chased into the house, the court was told.</p>
      <p>The widower became emotional as he told jurors: "When she got an arrow she just screamed. I was thinking, 'what is happening?', I was screaming for her.</p>
      <p>"Then from there, because he had a second crossbow on his shoulder, I was thinking he's used one and now the second one might be for me."</p>

      <p>Afterwards, he told police he was aiming for Mr Muhammad but his former spouse got in the way.</p>
      <p>Giving evidence, he claimed the crossbow went off by accident and he bought the weapons to go hunting in Mauritius with his brother.</p>
      <p>He told jurors he only wanted to confront Mr Muhammad about his concerns that his daughter was being brought up a Muslim.</p>
      <p>But the prosecution argued Unmathallegadoo's ultimate plan had been to restrain the couple and their children and at least kill the two adults and the unborn child.</p>
      <p>The jury in Unmathallegadoo's first trial was discharged after a juror raised an issue of psychiatric illness against the judge's direction not to speculate and despite no evidence being heard about his mental state.</p>
