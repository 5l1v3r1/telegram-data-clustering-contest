      <h1>Sean Ono Lennon goes to bat for Tulsi Gabbard, asks donors to help her qualify for December debate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:56:52+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:56</time> by <a rel="author">Dom Calicchio</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york">New York</a> man with famous parents posted a message on Twitter on Saturday night, urging people to donate to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">2020 presidential</a> campaign of U.S. Rep. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tulsi-gabbard">Tulsi Gabbard</a>, D-Hawaii.</p>
      <p>The request came from Sean Ono Lennon, the 44-year-old son of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/john-lennon-yoko-ono-documentary-making-imagine">John Lennon and Yoko Ono</a>.</p>

      <p>“Even if you are skeptical of @TulsiGabbard you can’t say she doesn’t deserve to be part of this race,” Lennon wrote. “She is the primary candidate who is adding to a conversation around ending unnecessary wars. Please donate a dollar. She only needs 3000 more individual donations.”</p>

      <p>Lennon’s message came as part of a retweet of a message posted by Gabbard, who is trying to qualify for the Democrats’ Dec. 19 debate in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>“We only need 3,000 more donors to reach the qualifying threshold for the December debate!,” Gabbard wrote. “Please donate what you can.”</p>

      <p>Aside from serving in Congress, Gabbard, 38, is a member of the Hawaii Army National Guard and served in Iraq in 2004-2005. During her presidential run she has called for bringing U.S. troops home from Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>“We are in a place in Afghanistan where we have lost so many lives. We've spent so much money,” Gabbard said in June, at a Democratic debate in Miami.</p>

      <p>Lennon is a member of the psychedelic rock band the Claypool Lennon Delirium, formed with musician Les Claypool.</p>

      <p>But while Lennon supports Gabbard – at least her effort to appear in the debate – he’s apparently not a fan of the far-left politics associated with his parents’ generation, according to messages he posted back in June.</p>
      <p>“When I was young the most interesting people were left wing intellectuals. Believe it or not,” he wrote.</p>
