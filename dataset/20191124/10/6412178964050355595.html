        <b>Belgium head coach Roberto Martinez was keen on taking over at Tottenham before Jose Mourinho landed the job, according to reports.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mourinho was brought in on a three-and-a-half-year contract on Wednesday following Mauricio Pochettino’s sacking on Tuesday, with the Portuguese guiding his new side to a <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tottenham-hold-on-to-give-mourinho-victory-in-premier-league-return"><b>3-2 victory over West Ham in his first game at the helm</b></a>.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/roberto-martinez-wanted-spurs-job-20946135"><b>Daily Star on Sunday</b></a>, however, former Everton boss Martinez was interested in becoming the new Spurs boss and was considering leaving his post with Belgium, despite the Red Devils being one of the favourites to win next summer’s European Championships.</p>
      <p>The newspaper adds that Martinez was always keen on leaving international management and returning to a club role if the right job presented itself, with the <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/tottenham-hotspur"><b>Spurs</b></a> post said to be of immediate interest to the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>It is claimed that Martinez was one of the candidates under consideration by Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy – who is an admirer of his work – but due to Mourinho making it clear that he wanted the job, Martinez and Spurs never scheduled formal talks.</p>
      <p>It looked as if Tottenham were cruising to a first three points under Mourinho at the London Stadium on Saturday having gone 3-0 up, but a second-half fightback from the Hammers pushed the visitors close.</p>
