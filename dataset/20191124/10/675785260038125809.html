      <h2>Tracey Bradbury is urging victims of domestic abuse to come forward and seek support following the tragic death of 27-year-old Natasha who was beaten to death in Haverfordwest</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:38:46+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:38</time> by <a rel="author">Bethan Thomas, Lorraine King</a></address>
      <p>A grieving mum has spoken about the horror of having to clean up her daughter's blood after she was beaten to death by her jealous partner.</p>
      <p>Tracey Bradbury had no idea 27-year-old Natasha was regularly being abused by Luke Jones as she kept her deadly secret to herself, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/murder-crime-haverfordwest-police-bradbury-17301586">Wales Online</a> reports.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-one suffered injuries to her neck, brain, liver, ribs and heart during the cowardly attack which killed her and Tracey was left to clean up the aftermath in her daughter's flat in Haverfordwest.</p>
      <p>She said: "Jones smashed up the place and there was blood all over the apartment. I had to clear out the apartment after that and wiped some of the blood from the house.</p>
      <p>"The first I heard that he was abusive was on the day she died. We still don't know if he'd been beating her the whole time they were together or not. But she was black and blue after it.</p>

      <p>"He'd (Jones) was always very quiet and we didn't know him that well but he'd stayed over at my house and I thought that he loved her and loved her son. I could never imagine that he could do this to her."</p>
      <p>Jones was jailed for life with a minimum of 17 years for Natasha's murder which has taken a toll on her devastated family's mental health and their finances three years on.</p>
      <p>Tracey is currently unable to return to work and is caring for Natasha's young son.</p>
      <p>She is also still struggling to pay off the cost of her daughter's funeral.</p>

      <p>"It just feels wrong that we are paying our taxes for him (Jones) in prison while we are struggling to get on with our everyday lives and struggling with money," Tracey said.</p>
      <p>"It has been really hard money wise. We still haven't paid off her funeral bill and she hasn't even got a headstone on her grave."</p>
      <p>Recalling the day she learnt her daughter had died, Tracey said she was at work at a care home in Pembrokshire when her husband Darren called her and told her to come home immediately.</p>
      <p>Police then broke the news to her that Natasha had been murdered by her on-off boyfriend for five years who the court was told was motivated by possessiveness and jealousy.</p>

      <p>Tracey said: "When I walked through the door, the police asked if I was Tracey and I said yes and then they told me that Natasha had been murdered.</p>
      <p>"I didn't believe it and then straight away I asked who has done this to her? Do I know this person and they said yes I know him and I said it was Luke wasn't it?"</p>
      <p>Paying tribute to her daughter, she said: "Natasha was the most loveable, funny, bright and bubbly girl.</p>
      <p>"She would have given you the last 10 pence she had in her purse. Everyone who met her loved her and she didn't deserve what happened her. She was a daughter, a sister and a mum.</p>

      <p>"I'm still watching the doors everyday, waiting for her to walk through the door. I miss her everyday and everyday is a struggle.</p>
      <p>"I can't even explain to you what losing a child is like. I wouldn't wish it on my enemies. I barely leave the house anymore. It feels like I am the one in prison."</p>
      <p>Natasha's childhood friend Chanice Dowling, 24, has set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/natasha-bradburys-headstone?utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=customer&amp;utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&amp;pc_code=ot_co_dashboard_a&amp;rcid=abccab3fa71e4703867764e50dbd0758&amp;fbclid=IwAR3NcQRCWp56L6ZvAurxeoJPzMj_XPFFyQ_Zwh1UVpiC_lV5dITImlcg2vc">GoFundMe page</a> to raise money for a headstone.</p>
      <p>Tracey added: "I go to her grave there every week and right now there's just a cross there and I feel like we haven't really laid her to rest so it would be a big weight off our shoulders and she deserves that."</p>
      <p>She said: "It would be a really big help to the family if they knew the community was behind them and that there were still good people in the world.</p>
      <p>"I think it would just mean a lot that Natasha would finally have a nice place for her to rest."</p>
      <p>Tracey is urging more victims of domestic abuse to speak out and ask for support.</p>
      <p>She said: "Natasha was really private and never spoke to me about it but victims need to speak out and get help.</p>
      <p>"I know that's easier said than done but it just takes one time for an abuser to lose their temper too much and explode and that was it with Natasha it was just one time and that was all it took."</p>
