      <p>For the better part of a decade, Oklahoma merrymakers have been making Lyric Theatre's "A Christmas Carol" a part of their seasonal customs.</p>
      <p>But the faithful staging of Charles Dickens' beloved yuletide ghost story isn't only a well-loved tradition for the audiences who flock to the Plaza Theatre to see the show.</p>
      <p>"It's become a part of my Christmas, and I just love it. I look forward to it every year. I fly home Christmas Day, but the six weeks before is another huge part of Christmas for me in Oklahoma City," said Dirk Lumbard, the North Carolina-based actor who is starring as Lyric's Ebenezer Scrooge for the fourth straight year.</p>
      <p>"It's a joy each time. ... Hopefully, I'm appropriately horrible."</p>
      <p>Lyric's ninth annual production of the cherished classic will come a-caroling Friday-Dec. 24, bringing to the Plaza District the Victorian tale of a miserly businessman who changes his selfish ways after he is haunted by four ghosts on the night before Christmas.</p>
      <p>"There's few constants in theater as far as getting to work with the same people because every show is a different cast and different creative team. There's something really comforting and sweet about knowing once a year we're going to gather as friends and as family — our Lyric family — to tell a story that we already know and we already love, that we know works and that audiences also want to see and get a lot out of of," said Lyric's Producing Artistic Director Michael Baron, who directs the show every year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Creative reunion</b>
      </p>
      <p>When he first moved to Oklahoma City, Baron said he told the Lyric Theatre board of directors that one of his goals was to create a professional production of “A Christmas Carol” that would not only establish a yuletide tradition for the theater but also would serve as a holiday home for the community's talented actors. Although every five years he shakes up the production with a new set, costumes and casting, the director said most of the company has been with the show since its start.</p>
      <p>The cast features many Lyric favorites, including Thomas E. Cunningham as Jacob Marley, Mr. Fezziwig and Old Joe; Charlie Monnot as Bob Cratchit; Mateja Govich as the Ghost of Christmas Present; Susan Riley as a solicitor; Matthew Alvin Brown as Topper; Lexi Windsor as Belle; Jennifer Teel as Mrs. Fred; and Brenda Williams as Mrs. Dilber. The production also features Andi Dema in the dual roles of Fred and Young Scrooge, Natalya Fisher as the Ghost of Christmas Past and Nakeisha McGee as Mrs. Cratchit.</p>
      <p>"There are nine or 10 of us adults that reunite every year ... and I love each and every one of them," said Lumbard, a seasoned actor whose Broadway credits include “The Music Man,” “Barnum” and “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."</p>
      <p>"Half the fun of this show is in the dressing room. ... It is hilarious down there. These people are very, very funny, very witty, and we're just like a family down there.."</p>
      <p>While the adult players mostly will remain the same until Baron revamps the whole show in a couple of years, the annual production gains two new casts of children each year who rotate throughout the show's run.</p>
      <p>Just like any other family, "The Christmas Carol" cast has bonded through hardship, Lumbard said, particularly last season when a flu outbreak meant the performers often had to double up on roles.</p>
      <p>"We'd just all get together and say, 'Let's make this work.' ... And it would become so rewarding at the very end of the evening because you pull it off — and that's one of the miracle things about theater," he said, adding that the production is adding four swing performers this year in case of illnesses or emergencies.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Redemption story</b>
      </p>
      <p>Although the costumes, sets and cast remain largely the same, Lumbard said that doesn't mean that the show is entirely unchanged.</p>
      <p>"It feels like I've gotten deeper into the character and gotten better at the character," he said. "I think it gets tweaked in different ways, and I think, generally, in better ways. ... So, the show that I did four years ago is not like the one that I do now — in a good way. I've grown and gotten deeper in it, and it seems like everybody does. Nobody takes that job, this particular production, lightly. We're all very invested in it."</p>
      <p>For Baron, "A Christmas Carol" is an vibrant reminder of the true significance — and potential — of the yuletide season.</p>
      <p>"Christmas has become fairly commercial ... so we get to talk about the real meaning of Christmas with this production," he said. "I think that's important because there's a lot of candy canes and icicles and Santa Clauses out there, but there's only one tale of redemption that's been told since 1843."</p>
