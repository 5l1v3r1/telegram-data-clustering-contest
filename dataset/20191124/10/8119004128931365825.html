      <p>The incident took place at the Al-Amin orphanage of the Farajikandi Uysiya Kamil Madrasa at 10pm on Saturday, said the institution's Principal Md Ataul Karim Mujahid.</p>

      <p>“The verandah floor then collapsed at 10pm. The students and a teacher were critically injured in the fall.”</p>
      <p>Later, they were rescued with the help of other students and locals. Informed of the matter, the fire service, upazila administration and police arrived on the scene and joined the rescue efforts, said Ataul.</p>
      <p>“The building poses high risk. No regulations were followed during its construction. It's unsuitable for living,” Deputy Assistant Director of Chandpur Fire Service Md Farid Uddin Ahmed said.</p>
