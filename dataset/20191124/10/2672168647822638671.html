      <p>TAIPEI (CNA) — Taipei has been ranked sixth out the 113 most inclusive cities in the world listed in the first ever Prosperity &amp; Inclusive City Seal and Awards (PICSA) index, Taipei City government announced late Thursday.</p>
      <p>The first annual PICSA report, released during an award ceremony held Thursday in Bilbao, northern Spain, is designed to showcase not only the quantity of economic growth in a city, but also its quality and distribution across populations.</p>
      <p>Elements taken into consideration when measuring a city’s inclusive prosperity included GDP per capita, personal safety, access to education, internet access, housing affordability, environmental quality and access to healthcare.</p>
      <p>As the best performing Asian city on the index, Taipei was ranked sixth, while Tokyo was the next best Asian performer at 39. Osaka, Singapore, Seoul and Hong Kong were placed 44, 46, 49, and 70, respectively.</p>
      <p>After Taipei, in descending order, were Oslo, Ottawa, Kiel, Geneva, Washington DC, Munich, Prague, Seattle, Stockholm, Boston, Amsterdam, Berlin, Eindhoven, and Bilbao, the host city of this year’s PISCA index.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the top five positions were taken by cities from northern Europe, with Zurich topping the list, followed by Vienna, Copenhagen, Luxembourg and Helsinki.</p>
      <p>According to the PICSA report, Taipei stood out on the 2019 PICSA index mainly due to its sustainability development efforts, and the city’s zero waste approach which aims to conserve natural resources and reduce pollution from extraction, manufacturing and disposal.</p>
      <p>The report also described Taipei as having a rich export-driven economy, and being a high-tech city known for its world leading information and technology industry.</p>
      <p>The PICSA top 20 award ceremony was held at Bilbao’s Guggenheim Museum on Thursday, with Taipei City government spokesperson Chou Tai-chu (周台竹) attending the event on behalf of Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲).</p>
      <p>The 2019 PISCA report was commissioned by the Basque Government and compiled by Australian-based consulting firm D&amp;L Partners.</p>
