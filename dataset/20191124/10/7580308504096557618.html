      <p>At least six bodies were recovered on Sunday after a small plane believed to have been carrying 19 passengers and crew crashed on takeoff into a densely populated area of Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
      <p>An official at Goma airport, Richard Mangolopa, told AFP no survivors were expected.</p>
      <p>“A number of bodies have just been recovered. The (rescue) teams are continuing to search,” added Goma mayor Timothee Muissa Kiesse.</p>
      <p>The Dornier-228 aircraft had been headed for Beni, 350 kilometres (220 miles) north of Goma when it went down in a residential area near Goma airport.</p>
      <p>“There were 17 passengers on board and two crew members. It took off around 9-9.10 am (0700 GMT),” Busy Bee airline staff member Heritier Said Mamadou said.</p>
