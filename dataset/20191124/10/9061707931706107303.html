      <p>Police remain at the scene of a fire in Derby today after spending all night investigating a blaze which broke out on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Fire crews from Kingsway, Nottingham Road and Ascot Drive were called to the scene in <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/alvaston">London Road, Alvaston</a> at 9.21pm. Police also attended and the road was closed for a time while the fire was dealt with.</p>
      <p>On Sunday morning, a police van was still parked outside the building, which appears to be a rooms-to-let property. Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service has also confirmed it has officers at the scene involved in the investigation.</p>
      <p>But both emergency services were remaining tight-lipped about what had happened and if there were any casualties.</p>
      <p>A Derbyshire police spokesman said: "We are investigating the fire and we have had officers at the scene all night involved in the investigation. We cannot give any more details."</p>

      <p>"I cannot comment further on the situation but it is still an open incident and we have officers there investigating."</p>
      <p>A nearby resident, who did not want to be named, said she had seen the emergency services there last night. She said: "I don't know what has happened but there were police cars and fire engines here until quite late."</p>
      <p>Another local person. who also did not wish to be named, added: "I live down Wisgreaves Road and heard a lot of sirens but I don't know what has happened. I just saw the police van there this morning that's all."</p>
