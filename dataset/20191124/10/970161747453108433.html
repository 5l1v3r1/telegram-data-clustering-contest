      <p>Authorities are still looking for a British man who went missing while camping in the Australian bush.</p>
      <p>A search involving a helicopter, boats and mounted police has failed to find any trace of Aslan King, 25, who disappeared in the state of Victoria on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>He went missing after suffering what friends have described as possibly a form of seizure during a coastal camping trip.</p>
      <p>Mr King, an illustrator from Bristol who only relocated to Australia two weeks ago, is said to have hit his head on the ground before getting up quickly and rushing into thick bushland surrounding the campsite where he and four friends had been staying.</p>
      <p>The site is near the town of Princeton, beside cliffs on the Victorian coast near the tourist site known as the Twelve Apostles.</p>

      <p>Sergeant Danny Brown said thermal imaging sensors used had so far detected no trace of Mr King, but added they may be utilised again.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘You’re using every sense, whether that be eyes, ears and touch as well.</p>
      <p>He added heat sensors would make ‘a massive difference, because we’re going to find things in areas that the eye can’t see’.</p>
      <p>Victoria Police were also searching for Mr King using motorcycles and sniffer dogs.</p>

      <p>Authorities said they were concentrating on a radius of 300 metres around the campsite, but said the search was difficult because of the thick vegetation, rocky clifftops and deep water coastal waters in the region.</p>
      <p>The area is also known to contain a large population of deadly tiger snakes.</p>
      <p>The Foreign Office said in a statement: ‘Our staff are seeking further information following the disappearance of a British man near Princeton, Australia and are in contact with the Australian police.’</p>
