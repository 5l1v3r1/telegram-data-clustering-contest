      <p>The funny man broke down from exhaustion, before being comforted by his fellow campers.</p>
      <p>“I was up in the Leaders Cabin, I was chatting to James (Haskell) and Jacqueline (Jossa) and I was just so tired, I just hit a wall,” he told the Bushtucker Telegraph.</p>

      <p>Andrew told Eastenders actress Jacqueline: “I honestly thought that I was gonna walk out, but I haven’t, when you’re tired, you just say ‘have I done the right thing’.”</p>
      <p>Jacqueline replied: “You’d never leave, I can tell that you’re just tired.”</p>
      <p>James also offered words of comfort to Andrew, saying: “Everyone has a bad day.”</p>
      <p>“You’re an important part of the group and we need you.”</p>
