      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/deontay-wilder/">Deontay Wilder</a> dismissed Ben Davison’s claims he spotted weaknesses during his rematch with Luis Ortiz in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tyson-fury/">Tyson Fury</a>’s coach had flown into Vegas to be ringside for the fight in a bid to do <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/tyson-fury-deontay-wilder-luis-ortiz-rematch-ben-davison-11180119/">some up close homework on his heavyweight’s next opponent</a>.</p>
      <p>Davison <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/ben-davison-identifies-weakness-deontay-wilder-ahead-tyson-fury-rematch-11208317/">suggested Wilder showed the ill effects of fighting Fury against Ortiz</a>, but the WBC champion laughed off the coach’s comments in his post-fight press conference.</p>
      <p>‘Every time a person fights, we see different holes and different things,’ Wilder said in response to Davison.</p>

      <p>‘You’re not going to be perfect in a fight, no one is. I hope he took notes and carries it back to his camp because I’m going to knock Fury out like I did the first time.</p>

      <p>‘Point blank, period. I’m not worried about what anyone says. I’m proven.</p>
      <p>‘If they were so sure about certain things and what they’d seen, he would have took the rematch immediately.</p>
      <p>‘I’m not running round doing a 100 thousand things. I was the one who demanded the rematch after a controversial decision.</p>
      <p>‘I’m the one fighting the best in the division. There’s no other fighters taking risks in any fights.’</p>

      <p>Fury and Wilder are scheduled to fight again on 22 February and concerns that date could be scrapped appear to have eased after the WBC champion <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/deontay-wilder-pulls-off-stunning-comeback-scorecards-revealed-luis-ortiz-rematch-11208296/">came through his clash with Ortiz unscathed</a>.</p>
      <p>Davison will now report back to Fury, who was not in attendance, and explained he spotted several holes in Wilder’s style.</p>
      <p>‘People will say he looked poor, but he took his time and he did what he was supposed to do,’ Davison said.</p>

      <p>‘I also learned that he was a different man fight week to what he was to when he fought Tyson.</p>
      <p>‘Tyson 100 per cent got under his skin, I definitely saw that in there, which is pretty understandable.</p>

      <p>‘Pressure of a big fight around the corner affected him.’</p>
