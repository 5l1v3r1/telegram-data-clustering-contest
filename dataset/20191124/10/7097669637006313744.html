      <h1>South Korea and America Do Not Share the Same Interests</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T10:15:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Olivia Schieber</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point: </b>It is unclear how well Seoul and Washington can work together in the future if they keep diverging.</p>
      <p>The United States has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the Korean War and a deterrent to North Korea. The costs of that deployment are shared by both the US and the ROK, with Seoul carrying close to $1 billion annually, roughly 40 percent of the total cost. But Donald Trump wants South Korea to pay more. Specifically, 400 percent more. That’s unlikely to happen.</p>
      <p>While policymakers and defense experts generally agree that South Korea can and should shoulder more of the burden, Seoul reacted with anger to the $5 billion ask US Defense Secretary Mark Esper relayed during a surly meeting earlier this week. Not only that, but the same day talks dissolved with the US, South Korea signed a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/18/china-signs-defence-agreement-south-korea-us-angers-seoul-demand/">defense agreement</a> with China. A $5 billion request is certainly a shock to the system, but the larger issue is that increasingly, South Koreans don’t believe their interests align with those of the US.</p>
