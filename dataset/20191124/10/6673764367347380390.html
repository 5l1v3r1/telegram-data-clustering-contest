      <p><b>YOKOHAMA – </b>Yokohama FC, the club created by fans of former J. League top-flight team Yokohama Flugels, booked a spot in the first division for 2020 with a 2-0 win at home over Ehime FC on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The win on the final day of the J2 season earned Yokohama FC second place and its second J1 season and first since 2007, when it finished 18th and earned a quick drop to the second division.</p>
      <p>Yusuke Minagawa converted a penalty kick in the 32nd minute and Kosuke Saito scored Yokohama FC’s other goal in the 52nd minute.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, J2 champions Kashiwa Reysol completed their season in the second tier with a 13-1 thumping of visiting Kyoto Sanga, with Kenyan striker Olunga scoring eight goals.</p>
      <p>Yokohama FC and Reysol will replace the bottom two J1 teams. The four clubs finishing third to sixth in J2 — Omiya Ardija, Tokushima Vortis, Ventforet Kofu and Montedio Yamagata — will compete for a chance to take part in a relegation-promotion playoff game against the J1 team finishing 16th.</p>
