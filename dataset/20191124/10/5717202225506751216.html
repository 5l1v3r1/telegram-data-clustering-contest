        <b>Glenn Hoddle explained during the latter stages of <a href="https://www.sport.bt.com/">BT Sport’s coverage of Tottenham Hotspur’s clash with West Ham (broadcast on 23/11; 14:20)</a> why he named Son Heung-min as his man of the match ahead of Harry Kane and Dele Alli. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Spurs have kicked off the Jose Mourinho era with a victory. Tottenham went 3-0 up inside 50 minutes at the London Stadium. Son and Lucas Moura bagged goals in quick succession shortly before the break. And Kane looked to put the game beyond doubt just after the restart.</p>

      <p>West Ham would fight back late on. Michail Antonio was the catalyst for their attempted comeback. The forward was excellent after coming on and scored a superb goal in the final 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>The Hammers’ second goal came in the dying seconds of the contest. And the final whistle blew almost immediately after.</p>

      <p>While it was another disappointing day for the home side, there were plenty of encouraging signs for Mourinho’s men. And Hoddle picked out three players who particularly impressed as he was asked to name his man of the match.</p>
      <p>“I think Harry Kane has been good,” <a href="https://www.sport.bt.com/">he told BT Sport</a>. “I think Dele Alli, first-half, has been excellent. But overall, for the 90 minutes, I’m going for Son. He’s been brilliant again. He’s put a stint in second-half down that left-hand side, defensively as well.”</p>
      <p>The result highlighted that there is plenty of work for Mourinho to do. But it also provided a reminder of how good a lot of Tottenham’s players can be.</p>
      <p>Son was one of the players who was in good form during the latter stages of Mauricio Pochettino’s tenure. No Spurs player has had a direct hand in more goals than the 27-year-old so far this season.</p>
      <p>He has now scored four goals and contributed four assists in the Premier League. Son has also scored five times in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>If he can maintain his current form over the coming months, and Mourinho can get the best out of those around him, Tottenham will certainly stand a fantastic chance of bouncing back from their underwhelming start.</p>
