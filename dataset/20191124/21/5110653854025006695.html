      <p>A boarding minor for Alex Kerfoot on Saturday could turn into a suspension. The 25-year-old will have a hearing Monday for his hit on defenseman Erik Johnson in the Leafs' 5-3 victory over the Colorado Avalanche.</p>
      <p>On the backcheck, Johnson raced for a puck behind the Avs net when Kerfoot came from behind and checked the blueliner in the lower back, sending him head-first into the boards.</p>
