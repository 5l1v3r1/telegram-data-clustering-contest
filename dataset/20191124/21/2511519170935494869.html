      <p>Four climate activists on hunger strike have pledged to continue going without food for a second week as they call on political leaders to act on the environmental crisis.</p>
      <p>More than 520 people in 28 countries, from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Barcelona">Barcelona</a> to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, joined Extinction Rebellion’s global hunger strike a week ago. </p>
      <p>Most of them – including at least 260 in the UK – signed up to go without food for seven days, but four of those in London say they intend to continue.</p>
      <p>In the UK, protesters camped outside the headquarters <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/extinction-rebellion-hunger-strike-conservative-labour-party-climate-change-a9207886.html">of the main political parties</a>, including 83-year-old Ursula Pethick.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/extinction-rebellion">Extinction Rebellion</a> campaigners have asked all parties for a filmed meeting. The Conservatives and the Brexit Party are the only ones not to have responded, the group claims.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid Cymru have agreed to meetings, and the group is in discussions with Labour about holding one, members said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/BorisJohnson">Boris Johnson</a> did not reply to campaigners camped outside his party’s base who called out to him to ask to meet on Saturday, merely giving a wave as he left the building to get into an official car, video on Twitter suggested.</p>
      <p>In Israel one protester has been on hunger strike for more than two weeks.</p>
      <p>After five days, another hunger striker, Steven Hollies, tweeted: “I am noticeably more lethargic this morning. I feel thin and hollow.” And by day six he added he was even more tired.</p>
      <p>Members said the aim of the hunger strike was to highlight the vulnerability of food security caused by the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/climate-crisis">climate crisis</a>.</p>
      <p>“People are already starving due to #ClimateBreakdown, and food insecurities will hit the UK too,” the group said.</p>

      <p>Mike Goldthorn, 30, a care worker from north Wales, said: “We are hunger-striking in solidarity with the people already suffering and the generations to come.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been on hunger strike since Monday and people I’ve been chatting to are amazingly supportive of what we are doing.”</p>
      <p>Emma Taylor, a prospective Labour candidate for Heene in West Sussex in next May’s elections, said: “Three decades of protests, petitions and campaigns have failed to secure an emergency response to mitigate ecological and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/climate-breakdown">climate breakdown</a>. Drastic times call for drastic measures.”</p>
      <p>A Brexit Party spokesman said Extinction Rebellion had claimed to have given a letter personally to Nigel Farage, the party leader, but that officials were not aware of it, adding that Extinction Rebellion members had turned up at the manifesto launch.</p>
      <p>“We would encourage them to write in, like other political groups, and go about things in a normal, civilised way, rather than this unusual means,” he said.</p>
      <p>The manifesto included an extensive section on environmental policies, he added.</p>
      <p>​The Conservatives did not respond to requests to comment.</p>
