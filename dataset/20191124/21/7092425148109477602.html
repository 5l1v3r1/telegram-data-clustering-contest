      <p>An order of nuns from Nuns' Island in Galway are resisting temptation to accept invites to perform on Britain's Got Talent.</p>
      <p>The Poor Clare sisters caught the eye of a top Britain's Got Talent scout after releasing a tune called "Calm the Soul".</p>
      <p>Following the release last month, the song has racked up more than 50,000 views online.</p>
      <p>It's so good that the sisters have received numerous invites to appear on the show, something they refuse every time, so as not to be counter-productive to their cause.</p>
      <p>Abbess of the Poor Clare Monastery, Sr Colette told The Irish Times:</p>
      <p>“A researcher from the show has been in touch a number of times asking us to perform Calm the Soul. We are thrilled by the invite of course but feel the message of the song might get lost somehow.</p>
      <p>“We don’t watch a lot of television so we wouldn’t be following the X-Factor and other shows like that on a regular basis. We have seen a few highlights though including Fr Ray Kelly singing the REM song Everybody Hurts.</p>
      <p>“Somebody also recommended that episode where Susan Boyle’s performance stunned the judges and that was lovely to watch.”</p>
      <p>What prompted the sisters to record "Calm the Soul" was the reaction to their best-selling book of the same name.</p>

      <p>A poem within the book touched people's hearts so much that they decided they should create music around it.</p>
      <p>The Order of Poor Clares is an enclosed contemplative community of nuns whose ethos revolves around poverty, humility and simplicity.</p>
      <p>The sisters hope their song continues to reach the masses, inspiring strength and comfort to those struggling.</p>
      <p>“We would hope that the song will give those who hear it a lift and maybe encourage those who have given up on God to renew the connection,” concluded Sr Colette.</p>
