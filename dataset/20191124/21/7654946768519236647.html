      <p>A star female college basketball player has been charged with murdering a 21-year-old man in Atlanta, Ga., according to authorities.</p>
      <p>Kamiyah Street — a junior who starts as point guard for Kennesaw State University in Georgia — was arrested on felony murder charges for her alleged role in Nashiem Hubbard-Etienne’s death, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/breaking-ksu-women-basketball-player-arrested-murder-charges/WR8aRO7P50bQpu2Xl4yEZL/#">the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported</a> Saturday.</p>
      <p>Hubbard-Etienne’s body was discovered shot to death July 16 in a parking lot at the Hermitage Station apartments, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Atlanta Police spokesman James White said it is apparent that Hubbard-Etienne was “the victim of a targeted shooting,” the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>Kennesaw State officials said its women’s basketball team was notified Thursday night of Street’s alleged involvement in the murder.</p>
      <p>“The individual has been suspended indefinitely from all women’s basketball team and athletic activities,” the school’s assistant athletic director, David Beal, told the outlet.</p>
