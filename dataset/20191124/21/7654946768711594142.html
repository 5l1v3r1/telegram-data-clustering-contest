      <h1>Jets completely dominate Raiders for third straight win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:04:47+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:04</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Costello</a></address>
      <p>It was just 11 days earlier that Jets CEO and chairman Christopher Johnson felt the need to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/adam-gase-will-remain-jets-coach-for-2020-season/">publicly state he was not firing coach Adam Gase</a> in an effort to quiet the noise around his team. Now, Johnson watched Gase push all the right buttons as his team delivered its most complete performance in recent memory.</p>
      <p>Gase and Co. blew out the Raiders 34-3 at MetLife Stadium on Sunday, a statement that this team has indeed turned the corner from its struggles in September and October. Those wins over the dismal Giants and Redskins? They were not a mirage. This team is playing its best football.</p>
      <p>The Raiders (6-5) entered this game in the thick of the AFC playoff race and riding a three-game winning streak. They left the building silver and black and red-faced after receiving a butt-whipping from the Jets.</p>
      <p>The Jets are on a three-game win streak for the first time since 2017. Now, they face the dismal Bengals and Dolphins in the next two weeks with the hopes of a five-game winning streak entering a Thursday night game in Baltimore.</p>
      <p>At 4-7, the Jets have stabilized their season. No, they are not making the playoffs. The win over the Raiders was their first against an AFC team and they have yet to beat a team in their division.</p>
      <p>But they have answered some questions. Gase no longer looks like the second coming of Rich Kotite, and all of that talk was premature. Gase called a great game Sunday and had the offense clicking. Gregg Williams matched him with a great defensive game plan that shut down Derek Carr, Josh Jacobs and Jon Gruden.</p>

      <p>Quarterback Sam Darnold was good … again. All the fears that came up last month when he saw ghosts and threw interceptions have vanished. Darnold completed 20 of 29 for 315 yards with touchdown passes to Ryan Griffin, Robby Anderson and a rushing touchdown of his own. Darnold had no turnovers for the second time in three games.</p>
      <p>The Jets blew the game open with a 21-point third quarter. They led 13-3 at halftime and then Gase and Darnold had a terrific series to open the second half. It began with a short pass to Braxton Berrios, who raced 69 yards to the 1. Then, Darnold faked to his right and threw back to his left to a wide open Griffin for a 1-yard touchdown and a 20-3 lead.</p>
      <p>The Jets defense then came up with a fourth-and-1 stop on the Raiders, stuffing fullback Alec Ingold at the Oakland 39. Gase called a reverse flea-flicker with Darnold hitting Anderson for a 30-yard gain. Three plays later, Darnold hooked up with Anderson again for a 1-yard score and the lead bulged to 27-3. Anderson had a big game after several quiet weeks, catching four passes for 86 yards and the touchdown.</p>
      <p>The defense then got in on the scoring when cornerback Brian Poole intercepted Carr after linebacker Neville Hewitt broke up a pass. Poole returned it 15 yards for the touchdown and the party at MetLife was on.</p>
      <p>Carr had a terrible day and was benched by Gruden toward the end of the third quarter. He went 15-for-27 for 127 yards and the interception for a 52.5 quarterback rating. The Jets also had to contend with Jacobs, the rookie running back from Alabama, and held him to 34 yards rushing, his season low.</p>
      <p>The Jets defense dominated again and showed why they have earned the ranking of No. 1 in the NFL against the run.</p>
      <p>The Raiders took a 3-0 lead and then the Jets scored 34 unanswered points — the third straight week they’ve scored exactly 34 points. It looked like they scored on their fifth straight opening drive, but a Demaryius Thomas touchdown was overturned after a review because of offensive pass interference on Jets tight end Daniel Brown.</p>
      <p>Darnold ran for a 4-yard touchdown in the second quarter to cap a 12-play, 96-yard drive and two Sam Ficken field goals put the Jets up 13-3 at halftime. Then, they took off in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Everything is rolling for the Jets at the moment. Johnson won’t have to give any votes of confidence this week.</p>
