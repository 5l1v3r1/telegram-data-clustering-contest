      <p>DINDOSHI POLICE is on the lookout for unknown fraudsters for allegedly duping a 27-year-old chartered accountant (CA) of Rs 2.02 lakh on the pretext of offering pocket-friendly travel package to Europe.</p>
      <p>According to police, the complainant had come across a travel website in September and had called on one of the phone numbers listed on it to book a trip to Europe. “While the call reportedly had gone unanswered, the complainant got a call back from a man who claimed to be the owner of the travel agency,” a police officer said. The fraudster, police said, allegedly offered an eight-day-and-seven-night travel package to Europe for Rs 2.02 lakh that included air fare.</p>
      <p>“The trip was scheduled to start in the first week of November. So, in the last week of September, the accused asked the complainant to make the payment on the pretext of making hotel and air ticket bookings,” the officer said.</p>
      <p>The CA reportedly made the payment in four transactions in October. On receiving the tickets, the complainant reportedly contacted the airline in October, which confirmed that his tickets had been booked, but said they were refundable. When the CA asked the accused, he was allegedly told that refundable tickets were booked to obtain visa and that the final travel tickets would be purchased from another airline. “The accused reportedly kept delaying the date to send the final air tickets. In the first week of November, the accused said as his mother was unwell he couldn’t book the travel tickets. He allegedly assured to return the amount, but went incommunicado following which the CA approached police,” the police officer said.</p>
      <p>He submitted a complaint in the first week of November following which a case was registered late last week under sections 419 (impersonation) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC and sections 66 (C) (identity theft) of the IT Act.</p>
      <p>The scammers, police said, operate mostly from remote areas of northern states. “The mobile number used for the crime remains switched off. We are trying to trace the accused through the bank account now,” a police officer said.</p>
