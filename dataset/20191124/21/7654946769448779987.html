      <h1>Packers vs. 49ers prediction, line: Take Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay</h1>

      <p>It’s a homecoming for Aaron Rodgers and a high-stakes game for both sides when the Packers meet the 49ers on Sunday night in San Francisco — or, more accurately, Santa Clara, Calif. Home-field advantage in the NFC playoffs could be on the line.</p>
      <p>The bye arrived at a good time for Green Bay, which was fortunate to beat Carolina in Week 10 and has a defense that’s leaking oil. Though the Packers rank 28th in total defense (384.7 yards per game) after some phony early-season hype, the offense has steadily improved. Rodgers has nine touchdown passes with no interceptions in the past four games, and running back Aaron Jones is off a 93-yard, three-touchdown performance against the Panthers. The Packers have scored 23 points or more in seven of their past eight games.</p>
      <p>San Francisco’s defense was dominant through the season’s first half but has declined while allowing an average of 26 points in the past three games. Jimmy Garoppolo has a turnover problem. He threw two more interceptions in Week 11 against the Cardinals and has 10 for the season.</p>
      <p>He has been less effective because of the 49ers’ injuries. Tight end George Kittle, running back Matt Breida, wideout Emmanuel Sanders and left tackle Joe Staley all appear to be questionable this week, so monitor the status of those key players. The 49ers’ +77 point differential at home is a little deceiving due to a 38-point beatdown of Carolina and a 28-point blowout of Cleveland. Their other three home games went to the wire, and this one should, too.</p>
      <p>It’s typically a good idea to take points with Rodgers, who is 2-0 SU/ATS as a road ’dog this season.</p>
      <p><b>The play:</b> Packers, +3</p>
