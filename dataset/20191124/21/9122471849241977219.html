      <h1>Video: Major Officiating Controversy In Saints-Panthers Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:24:37+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Few things in the NFL seem to go better together than the New Orleans Saints and officiating controversy. Of course, we had some controversy at the end of today’s Saints-Panthers game.</p>
      <p>The NFL has refused to change pass interference calls (or non-calls) basically all season long, despite implementing the challenge rule. The Saints, of course, are the reason for this rule being in place. New Orleans was screwed on a missed call in the playoffs last year.</p>
      <p>So it’s fitting (and just devastating) that the Saints would be on the receiving end of one of the rare flipped pass interference calls due to the new challenge rule. We had that happen in today’s Saints-Panthers game.</p>
      <p>Carolina had an incomplete pass on a 3rd and 3 from New Orleans’ 5-yard line with a little more than two minutes to play. No pass interference was called. The Panthers challenged and, surprisingly, the call was flipped, extending the drive.</p>
      <p>Saints fans are not happy.</p>

      <p>Now, it probably was pass interference, but there have been several plays (or worse) like that all season long. And it’s extremely rare for the call to be overturned.</p>
      <p>It didn’t end up costing New Orleans, though. The Panthers came away with no points on the drive when their 28-yard field goal was missed.</p>
      <p>The Saints and the Panthers are tied, 31-31, with a little more than a minute to play.</p>
