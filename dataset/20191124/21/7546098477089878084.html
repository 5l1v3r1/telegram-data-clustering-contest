      <h1>3 ASX shares that made waves last week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:45:22+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/sbowen/" target="_blank">Sebastian Bowen</a></address>
      <p>With another week come and gone, the ASX gave up a lot of its November gains in what was a bruising week for the share market. The <b>S&amp;P/ASX200</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/S%26amp%3BP%2FASX200/?ticker=ASX-XJO">(ASX: XJO)</a> started last Monday at 6,793.7 points but finished on Friday at 6,709.8 points – a substantial weekly drop of 1.24%.</p>
      <p>Here are 3 ASX shares that caught my eye last week.</p>
      <h3>Westpac Banking Corp <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-WBC/">(ASX: WBC)</a></h3>
      <p>Westpac was definitely the market loser last week. WBC shares have been pilloried after news that AUSTRAC is alleging Westpac breached Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing laws up to 23 million times, and is likely to be facing massive fines (right in the middle of its capital raising efforts). WBC shares started on Monday at $26.51 but finished up on Friday at $24.77 – a weekly drop of 6.56%.</p>
      <h3>Sydney Airport Holdings Pty Ltd <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-SYD/">(ASX: SYD)</a></h3>
      <p>On a lighter note, Sydney Airport caught my eye last week as its shares printed another new all-time high of $9.04 on Tuesday. Higher than expected passenger numbers from the month of October appear to have been the catalyst for this move. But for me, it once again proves the resilience of this stellar ASX dividend stock. SYD shares have pulled back slightly and ended the week at $8.91 on Friday. SYD shares offer a starting yield of 4.32% based on this price.</p>
      <h3>Qantas Airways Ltd <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/ASX-QAN/">(ASX: QAN)</a></h3>
      <p>Qantas also makes the list for banking a new all-time high. QAN shares have been trending steadily higher since June, but last Wednesday reached previously untrodden grounds at the level of $7.22. The catalyst for this move appears to have been a series of favourable brokering notes in recent weeks. QAN shares are now up 24% YTD.</p>
      <h3>Foolish Takeaway</h3>
      <p>With highs and lows all round, it certainly was a roller-coaster of a week for the ASX last week. Who knows what this week will bring!</p>
