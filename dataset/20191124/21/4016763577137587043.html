      <h1>Bink! &amp; Mike Dean Argue Over Production Credits On Kanye West’s “Devil In A New Dress”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:28:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:28</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Kelley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/kanye-west">Kanye West</a>’s <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Kanye-west/My-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a></i> recently <a href="https://www.bet.com/music/2019/11/22/kanye-west_s-_devil-in-a-new-dress-is-taking-fans-down-memory-la.html">trended on Twitter</a> in the wake of its ninth anniversary this week. However, producers <a href="https://genius.com/artists/bink">Bink!</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/mike-dean">Mike Dean</a> got into a heated exchange over the production credits on <a href="https://genius.com/Kanye-west-devil-in-a-new-dress-lyrics">“Devil in a New Dress.”</a></p>
      <p>The 2010 album cut is the only track on <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i> where West has <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/01/best-kanye-west-songs/">no production credit</a>. The dispute started when <i>Complex</i> <a href="https://twitter.com/ComplexMusic/status/1197960236713332737">tweeted a meme</a> about the track, prompting Dean to chime in:</p>

      <p>Bink! voiced his disagreement with Dean, minimizing his co-producer’s role in the production:</p>

      <p>In a now-deleted tweet, Bink! added: “To all that know me know I don’t need no LAME ASS WHITE BOY to help me with shit! He’s putting on for the net rt now! @therealmikedean know fucking well he has never and will never be as soulful as me! Foh.”</p>

      <p>Bink! also suggested there is an imbalance in the way the two producers are credited, to which Dean responded:</p>

      <p>Dean later “co-signed” a screenshot of an old tweet by Bink!:</p>

      <p>Back in 2018, Dean tweeted about the co-producers’ roles in the studio:</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://genius.com/artists/rick-ross">Rick Ross</a>-assisted song samples <a href="https://genius.com/artists/smokey-robinson">Smokey Robinson</a>’s <a href="https://genius.com/Smokey-robinson-will-you-love-me-tomorrow-lyrics">cover</a> of <a href="https://genius.com/artists/carole-king">Carole King</a>’s <a href="https://genius.com/Carole-king-will-you-love-me-tomorrow-lyrics">“Will You Love Me Tomorrow?”</a> The album version of the track culminates in a guitar solo by Dean.</p>
      <p>Bink! previously talked to <a href="https://djbooth.net/features/2015-08-18-bink-producing-dr-dre-devil-in-a-new-dress">DJBooth</a> about how the song came about. “Kanye sent me out to Hawaii to work with him and I was actually just holding my laptop and [the beat] came on in my iTunes,” he said. “He heard it through my laptop speakers and he was immediately intrigued; I wasn’t even gonna play it for him. He overheard it and asked, ‘What’s that?’”</p>
      <p>Ross recently released his memoir, <i>Hurricanes</i>, where he recounted how West made him <a href="https://genius.com/a/kanye-west-made-rick-ross-redo-his-devil-in-a-new-dress-verse">redo his verse</a> on “Devil in a New Dress.” “In all my years no one had ever asked me to rewrite a verse before,” he wrote. “Even when I was a nobody ghostwriting for artists way bigger than me no one had ever said something like that.”</p>
