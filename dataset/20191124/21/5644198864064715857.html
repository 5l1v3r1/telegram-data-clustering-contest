      <p>Spain's Jon Rahm claimed the Race to Dubai title on Sunday after he held off fellow contender Tommy Fleetwood to secure a one-shot victory at the season-ending DP World Tour Championship.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Spain's Jon Rahm claimed the Race to Dubai title on Sunday after he held off fellow contender Tommy Fleetwood to secure a one-shot victory at the season-ending DP World Tour Championship.</p>
      <p>Rahm opened up a six-shot advantage after seven holes at Jumeirah Golf Estates before Fleetwood made a late charge, finishing with a final round 65 to set the clubhouse target at 18-under.</p>

      <p>Needing a birdie at the final hole to beat Fleetwood's mark, Rahm produced a sublime bunker shot to within three feet before rolling home to secure the Harry Vardon Trophy.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old Rahm became the second Spaniard after the late Seve Ballesteros to win the European Tour's season-long Race to Dubai crown or its predecessor, the Order of Merit.</p>
      <p>"Seve was such an idol for us," Rahm said. "To put my name there, it's hard to believe. I can't believe some of the things I have accomplished."</p>
      <p>Fleetwood's putter was hot on the back nine as he holed long putts on the 15th and 17th before a spectacular chip on the last moved him alongside Rahm, who scripted a remarkable finish of his own to lift his sixth European Tour title.</p>
      <p>Rahm takes home US$3 million for his win in Dubai as well as a US$2 million bonus for topping the 2019 money list.</p>
      <p>"It was such an up and down day," he added. "I had a six-shot lead and I came down 18 needing a birdie to win.</p>
      <p>"But how many times do you dream of having to birdie the last to win a tournament?"</p>
      <p>Mike Lorenzo-Vera, who started the day with a share of the overnight lead, slipped two behind when he took two chips to get out of rough on his way to bogeying the third.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman recovered with two birdies on the back nine to sign for a 70 and seal a third-placed finish.</p>
      <p>Scotland's Robert MacIntyre won the 2019 rookie race with a solid round of 69 to finish tied-14th.</p>
      <p>World number two Rory McIlroy finished seven shots off the lead with a sluggish round of 73, one clear of last year's Dubai winner Danny Willett and two ahead of Sergio Garcia, Tom Lewis and Thomas Pieters.</p>
