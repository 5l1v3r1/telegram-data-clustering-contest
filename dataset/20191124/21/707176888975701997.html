      <h1>Leaks offer glimpse inside China’s detention camps</h1>
      <h2>Cache of documents shows how Xinjiang spied on and imprisoned more than 1m Uighurs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:13:36+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:13</time> by <a rel="author">Christian Shepherd, Lauren Fedor</a></address>
      <p>A leak of classified Communist party documents has revealed the most detailed evidence yet that senior leaders ordered mass detentions in western China’s Xinjiang region.</p>
      <p>A 2017 internal directive, obtained by the <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm/">International Consortium of Investigative Journalists</a> based in Washington, laid out a detailed plan to increase the use of “vocational training and education centres”, the official name for internment camps in the region. </p>
      <p>Over the past two years, more than 1m Muslim Uighurs and other minority groups have been sent to extrajudicial detention facilities where they have undergone ideological training as part of a security clampdown in Xinjiang.</p>
      <p>The document was signed by Zhu Hailun, the head of Xinjiang’s Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the most powerful legal body in the region. The plan, alongside a cache of five other documents released by the consortium, had been verified by independent experts and shared with more than a dozen media organisations.</p>
      <p>The directive also reveals that detainees are still monitored after their release from the camps, with their files transferred to a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dfec4ac4-6bf5-11e9-80c7-60ee53e6681d">mass surveillance</a> platform that the police are building in the region.</p>
      <p>The Chinese government has insisted its detention camps are necessary to prevent <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/67c29f1a-3812-11e9-b72b-2c7f526ca5d0">terrorism</a>. China’s State Council said <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cdd24ce0-4944-11e9-bbc9-6917dce3dc62">this year</a> that it had arrested almost 13,000 “terrorists” as part of the effort. Liu Xiaoming, China’s ambassador to the UK, on Sunday said that the documents were “pure fabrication”.</p>
      <p>In the past few years, Chinese police have adopted facial and gait recognition, eye tracking, crowd analysis technologies and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/68155560-fbd1-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6">“emotion recognition”</a> systems, which use video footage to analyse what local officials describe as one’s “mental state”. </p>

      <p>The documents also instruct camp personnel on how to maintain secrecy and prevent escapes at the facilities, and set out methods of forced indoctrination. </p>
      <p>Camps use a points system designed to modify behaviour by meting out punishments and rewards. Inmates can be detained indefinitely but must serve at least a year, in which they earn credits for “ideological transformation” and “compliance with discipline”.</p>
      <p>China’s treatment of the Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups has sparked international condemnation, but the US government has been especially critical, as trade tensions rise between the two countries.</p>
      <p>Last month Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/51e0f3f4-ea05-11e9-85f4-d00e5018f061">said</a> China had pursued a “highly repressive” campaign against the Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups, and the Trump administration would impose visa restrictions on Chinese government officials connected to their mass detention. Mr Pompeo has also urged countries to reject Chinese government requests to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5dce5032-ddd3-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc">repatriate</a> people from Xinjiang.</p>
      <p>This month, the World Bank <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4be2a2d8-04a2-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd">announced</a> it was scaling back a $50m project to fund vocational training in Xinjiang, after an internal review.* The World Bank said that while its probe “did not substantiate” allegations that the project supported schools involved in the arbitrary detention of Muslims, it would scrap the plans.</p>
