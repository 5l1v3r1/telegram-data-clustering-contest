      <h2>The two musicians have a long running feud, and Williams wants to settle his differences with the Oasis frontman in a KSI vs Logan Paul-style bout in the ring</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:07:41+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:07</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/eddie-hearn">Eddie Hearn</a> has been approached by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/robbie-williams">Robbie Williams</a> about a potential celebrity boxing match involving him and Liam Gallagher.</p>
      <p>The 'Angels' singer, 45, has a well-publicised rivalry with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liam-gallagher">Gallagher</a> , 47, which dates back to the mid-nineties.</p>
      <p>Williams admitted back in October he hoped to battle it out with the Oasis frontman in a bout similar to that of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/breaking-ksi-beats-logan-paul-20852127">Youtube stars KSI and Logan Paul</a> .</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/robbie-williams-liam-gallagher">GQ</a> at the time: "I’d love it. But I’d want it to be a professional fight. I’ve seen how much KSI and Logan Paul made from theirs and I think we could trounce that.</p>
      <p>"But, yeah, I think last time in the noughties Liam wanted to go down to an abandoned railway track or something. I don’t want to do that. It’s got to be f****** whistles and bells if it happens."</p>

      <p>Now it seems the potential plans have gone a step further, after Williams revealed on the Jonathan Ross show that he has made contact with Eddie Hearn over staging a bout with Gallagher.</p>
      <p>He claims that Hearn - who promoted the KSI vs Logan Paul fight - is up for it, although Gallagher is yet to reply.</p>
      <p>The pair were good friends at the height of Williams' fame with Take That in the nineties, before a bitter falling out.</p>

      <p>Williams famously called out Gallagher while accepting an ward at the Brit Awards one year, taunting: "Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough."</p>
      <p>He has since referred to Gallagher as a school bully in a recent interview with the Sun.</p>

      <p>“I admire [Gallagher]. He is the voice of a generation, the last of a dying breed, as pop stars are so boring these days,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But I still want to fight him. He represents a school bully to me and I would like to take the bully down.”</p>
      <p>KSI and Logan Paul's fight drew much interest, although Hearn stated prior to their professional bout that the celebrity match would be a one-off.</p>
