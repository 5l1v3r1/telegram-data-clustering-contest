      <p>DENVER (AP) — An alleged white supremacist accused of plotting to bomb a historic Colorado synagogue is due in federal court Monday.</p>
      <p>Twenty-seven-year-old Richard Holzer is scheduled to be advised of the new charges against him and will be asked to enter a plea.</p>
      <p>He now faces a total of three charges under a grand jury indictment announced Friday — attempting to obstruct the exercise of religion by force by using explosives and fire against Temple Emanuel in Pueblo, attempted arson and using fire or an explosive device to commit a felony.</p>
      <p>Holzer was arrested Nov. 1 after the FBI said he accepted what turned out to be phony explosives from undercover agents to bomb the synagogue.</p>
      <p>His attorney is from the federal public defender’s office, which doesn’t comment on allegations.</p>
