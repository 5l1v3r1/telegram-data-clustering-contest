      <h2>Latest Birmingham City news | Blues take on the Owls at Hillsborough in the Sky Bet Championship on Wednesday night</h2>

      <p>Sheffield Wednesday look set to be without one of their key players when they face <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> this week.</p>
      <p>Blues take on the Owls at Hillsborough on Wednesday night in the Sky Bet Championship, and do so on the back of a draw.</p>
      <p>Pep Clotet’s side were held to a 1-1 stalemate with Huddersfield Town on Saturday, which leaves Blues in 15th place in the Championship table.</p>
      <p>Wednesday have been dealt a blow for the clash against Blues, with defender Liam Palmer set to miss the match due to suspension.</p>
      <p>Palmer received a straight red card in Wednesday’s 2-1 defeat to West Bromwich Albion at the weekend, and is set to serve a three-match ban.</p>
      <p>The Scotland international was given his marching orders after a challenge on West Ham loanee Grady Dianagana in the closing stages of the match at The Hawthorns.</p>
      <p>Owls boss Garry Monk, who goes up against his former club for the first time on Wednesday night, had no complaints over the decision which saw Palmer depart early.</p>

      <p>"He was probably a little bit disappointed with the goal in terms of he could have cleared it," Monk told the <a href="https://www.thestar.co.uk/sport/football/sheffield-wednesday/latest-owls-news/sheffield-wednesday-two-men-contention-replace-liam-palmer-against-birmingham-city-1321182">Sheffield Star.</a></p>
      <p>"I don't have any complaints at this moment in time."</p>
      <p>Summer signing Moses Odubajo could replace Palmer for the clash against Blues on Wednesday, as could centre-back Dominic Iorfa who can perform in the full-back role.</p>
