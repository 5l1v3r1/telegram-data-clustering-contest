      <h1>Urban Meyer Reacts To Ohio State’s 11-0 Start</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:11:27+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>With a win over Michigan this coming Saturday, Ohio State would finish the regular season 12-0. They haven’t done that since 2012, Urban Meyer’s first year as head coach.</p>
      <p>Meyer has no doubt been enjoying watching his protege Ryan Day lead the Buckeyes to an 11-0 start. He got to see yesterday’s win over Penn State up close as a member of FOX’s pregame coverage.</p>
      <p>Still, he doesn’t want to see his old program get its head too swollen before “The Game” against Michigan on Saturday. That’s why Meyer tweeted one of his favorite mantras this afternoon.</p>
      <p>“Best thing about 11-0….”he wrote.</p>

      <p>Every OSU fan knows how to finish that statement off: “the chance to go 12-0.”</p>
      <p>Ohio State will face Michigan on Saturday looking to go 12-0. The last time the Buckeyes lost to the Wolverines was 2011, the year before Meyer started as head coach.</p>
      <p>Obviously, Ohio State doesn’t want to lose this game, but they have some leeway here. They’ve already locked in a spot in the Big Ten Championship Game, and as long as they win that, they’ll be in the CFP.</p>
