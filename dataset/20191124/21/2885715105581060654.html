      <p>Newly appointed Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a> late Sunday evening held a meeting with Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar at his official home Varsha to discuss agriculture-related challenges and financial assistance for farmers adversely hit by unseasonal rains.</p>
      <p>The Twitter handle @CMOMaharashtra said Fadnavis and Ajit “today met and discussed on various measures for additional support &amp; assistance to unseasonal rain-affected farmers. Tomorrow it will be further discussed with the chief secretary and finance secretary.”</p>
      <p>Sources said the newly sworn in functionaries, who are yet to prove that they have the numbers to form the government, were likely to have spoken about the political developments in the state. Sources said the two were likely to have discussed legal and legislature-related issues as well.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court has asked the Centre to provide documents submitted by Fadnavis to Governor Bhagat Singha Koshiyari following which the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> was invited to form the government in Maharashtra.</p>
