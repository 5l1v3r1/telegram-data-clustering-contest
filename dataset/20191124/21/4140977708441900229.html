            <b>KAR Vs MUM Dream11 : Overwhelming favourites for the tournament Mumbai and Karnataka go at loggerheads today in a riveting affair.</b>
          </p>
          <p>There couldn’t have been a better encounter to usher in a new week in the dramatic land of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy than today’s encounter between Mumbai and Karnataka. The two sides are gargantuan units, teams who are touted to not just occupy a place atop of Group B but also make a real bid for the glistening trophy.</p>
          <p>After winning the Vijay Hazare Trophy, Karnataka have emanated the same pristine form which won them that tournamnet to lose just one match in the ongoing edition of the domestic T20 tournamnet. The side are unbeaten as things stand in the Super League stage of tournamnet with three wins in succession, a spree which they’ll be looking to remain intact come today’s encounter as well.</p>

                <p>The side are making an advent into today’s encounter having tasted consummate success against Punjab, a run chase which was a testament to their resounding batting order. Needing 164 runs to win, the side couldn’t have made things any easier for themselves as they cruised to a 7 wicket win with two overs to spare.</p>
                <p>Elsewhere, Mumbai find themselves in fourth place in the group after a chastening defeat against Tamil Nadu, one which is bound to hurt the side. A despondent batting display saw the side engulfed in a tiff as their 121 runs left the bowlers miffed with Tamil Nadu easing their way to a successful run chase inside 14 overs with the 7 wickets in hand. </p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>One of the most sluggish wickets in the tournamnet to bat on, this is a track which bounds to indulge us in a low scoring affair. The ball will grip, turn and spin squarely over here but with the track bound to remain the same across the clash, the team winning the toss is bound to come out and chase today.</p>

                              <b>Mumbai</b>

                            </ul>
                            <h3>KAR Vs MUM Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>His side’s leading run getter with a stellar 322 runs from 9 encounters to emerge as the talisman of his side’s batting order, Aditya Tare was always going to be an instant pick for us. The player has been in imperious form, piling on the runs for his side at a hectic rate and if Mumbai are going to have any chance of winning, he’s going to emulate the same performance.</p>
                            <h3>KAR Vs MUM Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>We begin this facet of our Dream 11 side with the pick of Devdutt Padikal with the player having garnered a sensational 404 runs from 9 matches. He’s been the focal point of his team’s setup across the last two most, undoubtedly the most inform player for the unit with runs on a consistent basis with the player using his expansive skill set to perfect effect.</p>
                            <p>Karun Nair comes in as well while the 247 runs in 5 matches see Manish Pandey give him company for the day along with Rohan Kadam whilst from Mumbai we are brining by imbedding Suryakumar Yadav into our Dream 11 side given the 218 runs he’s managed to ally up till now.</p>
                            <h3>KAR Vs MUM Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>In Shubham Ranjane, Mumbai have an all-rounder who is an imperious performer, someone who has incorporated his skill set with both the bat and ball to come up with several match winning performances. He has an enormous repertoire of attributes, ones which make him a safe pick for the day to see us venture in with the cricketer.</p>
                            <h3>KAR Vs MUM Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Given the wicket prevelant and Mumbai’s plausible collapse with the side being vulnerable to falling infront of a vicious bowling unit, we had to make this facet of our side about the picks from Karnataka. We begin with Shreyas Goal, someone who legspin brand of bowling is not only going to cramp the batters for space but also leave them flummoxed and flabbergasted.</p>
                            <p>With 11 wickets, V Koushik joins him alongside Ronit More while from Mumbai our singular pick is going to compose Shams Mulani who has not only returned with 10 wickets but has snared the 73 runs as well for his unit.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Devdutt is being selected as our captain for the day whilst Shreyas will represent us as the vice-captain.</p>
