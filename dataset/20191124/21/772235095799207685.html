      <p><b>Tesla</b> boss <b>Elon Musk</b> has released via social media a video showing the <b>Cybertruck’s</b> side glass can withstand a strike from a <b>metal ball,</b> after two windows shattered during an embarrassing demonstration at the vehicle’s unveiling in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Musk was left red faced after a stunt to demonstrate the strength of the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/809781/tesla-cybertruck-yes-this-is-it-on-sale-in-us-now-from-39900-australian-plans-uncertain/">Tesla Cybertruck’s</a> “armour glass” failed not once but twice in front of a live global audience.</p>
      <p>Minutes after mocking the toughness of mainstream pick-ups such as the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/ford-f-150/">Ford F-150</a>, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/chevrolet/silverado/">Chevrolet Silverado</a>, and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/ram/1500/">Ram 1500</a>, Musk had an offsider take a swing at the Tesla Cybertruck’s stainless steel door panels and then throw a metal ball – a bit bigger than a golf ball – at the driver’s door window.</p>
      <p>However the stunt backfired when the glass shattered, which prompted Musk to say under his breath: “Oh my f- - - king god”.</p>
      <p>To try to prove how strong the glass was a second time, the metal ball was thrown at the rear window, but that shattered too.</p>
      <p>Musk looked genuinely stunned that the glass had broken, given that the test had worked in the lead-up to the event, he said, claiming the design team even threw a “kitchen sink” at it.</p>
      <p>Less than 24 hours after the launch of the Tesla Cybertruck, Musk released a slow motion video of the same test in which the glass did not break.</p>
      <p>Musk initially thought the ball may have been thrown with too much force during the on-stage demonstration, however another theory has since emerged.</p>

      <p>Some experts believe the test of the glass immediately before the global unveiling of the Tesla Cybertruck may have created a micro-fracture, and the strike on stage may have been enough to break it.</p>
      <p>However, that doesn’t explain why the rear glass shattered as well. It is unclear if Tesla had tested the steel ball on the rear glass prior to the stage show.</p>
      <p>Appearing at times nervous, Musk then began explaining the Tesla Cybertruck’s features as he stood awkwardly in front of the two pieces of shattered glass.</p>
      <p>Musk later said: “Oh well, a little room for improvement … it’s a little weird it broke now. (In testing) we threw everything at it, including a kitchen sink. At least it didn’t go through.”</p>

      <p>In the 48 hours since the launch of the Tesla Cybertruck, which was unveiled Thursday evening in Los Angeles, motoring fans around the world are still trying to figure out if it’s real or not, and what design changes might be necessary before the vehicle hits the road.</p>
      <p>While the triangular shape makes the Tesla Cybertruck look like something out of a science fiction movie, experts are wondering if its sharp lines would pass pedestrian safety tests and if the sleek headlights and taillights – and lack of bumpers – meet regulations.</p>
      <p>It has also been noted there is no Tesla badging on the vehicle and the only colour available is the silver/grey stainless steel finish of the show car.</p>
      <p>It has also since become apparent why the rear of the vehicle tapers the way it does: the sloping flat cover for the ute tray is more aerodynamic than an open cargo box.</p>

      <p>Some pundits have speculated the Cybertruck’s unveiling was a stunt to raise more money for the firm.</p>
      <p>However, despite the oddball looks and bold claims, Tesla insists the Cybertruck is real and coming to US showrooms in the next two years or so.</p>
      <p>There are still no plans announced for Australia. Tesla is yet to reveal if the Cybertruck will be made in right-hand-drive.</p>
