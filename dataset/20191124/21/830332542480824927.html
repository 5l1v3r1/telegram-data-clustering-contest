      <p>SHAKOPEE, Minnesota (CNN) - Plane crashes usually leave debris scattered across the ground, but a crash in rural Minnesota created a different image: a Piper Cub entangled in power lines and dangling upside down -- with the pilot inside.</p>
      <p>The single-propeller plane was traveling south near Shakopee on Saturday afternoon when it "hit a cluster of power lines and became suspended on a guideline, upside down," <a href="https://www.scottcountymn.gov/civicalerts.aspx?AID=623">a news release from the Scott County Sheriff's Office said</a>.</p>
      <p>Once the power line was de-energized, pilot Thomas Koskovich, 65, of Shakopee was rescued, the news release said. He was the sole occupant of the plane and uninjured.</p>
      <p>"This incident could have been much worse," Scott County Sheriff Luke Hennen said. "We are grateful the pilot was able to walk away without any injuries."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the FAA said the agency is investigating the crash. Shakopee is about 25 miles southwest of Minneapolis.</p>
