        <b>Augsburg 4-0 Hertha Berlin</b>
      </p>
      <p>Augsburg registered back-to-back wins for the first time this season after thumping ten-man Hertha Berlin 4-0 on Sunday afternoon at WWK Arena.</p>
      <p>The hosts got two quick goals from Philipp Max and Sergio Cordova before things went horribly bad for Hertha as they were reduced to ten men shortly thereafter in the 28th minute after Rune Jarstein was sent off.</p>
      <p>Augsburg gained more momentum as second-half goals from Andre Hahn and Florian Niederlechner completed the rout.</p>
      <p>Augsburg moved up to 12th on the table with 13 points from 12 matches while Hertha dropped down to 15th on the log with 11 points.</p>

        <b>Hoffenheim 1-5 Mainz</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ten-man Mainz had a day to remember after thumping Hoffenheim to a 5-1 at Prezero Arena on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>Levin Oztunali broke the deadlock for Mainz in the 33rd minute before the visitors were down to ten men on the stroke of half-time after Ridle Baku was sent off. Nevertheless, they went 2-0 up early in the second stanza thanks to an own goal by Pavel Kaderabek, while Pierre Kunde made it 3-0 just after the hour-mark.</p>
      <p>Andrej Kramaric pulled a goal back for Hoffenheim with seven minutes remaining but Jean-Paul Boetius and Kunde got two goals in the closing minutes to complete the rout for Mainz.</p>
      <p>Mainz moved out of the drop-zone and went up to 13th on the table, while Hoffenheim were left in eighth place with 20 points from 12 rounds of action.</p>
