      <p><b>Kathmandu</b><b>:</b> Nepal and China will be discussing a feasibility study for the Kathmandu-Pokhara-Lumbini railway line for which a 23-member Chinese team is arriving in Kathmandu on Monday. This is being viewed as part of the efforts by China to link Nepal strategically with its various trans-Himalayan connectivity projects. “Besides discussing the modality of preparing the detailed project report for the Kathmandu-Kerung railway, the delegates will also discuss ways to conduct the feasibility study for the Kathmandu-Pokhara-Lumbini railway,” Balram Mishra, director-general of the Department of Railways, told the Kathmandu Post.</p>
      <p>During the recent state visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping, China had agreed to extend a grant for the feasibility studies. The meeting is expected to finalize the date for the Kathmandu-Kerung detailed project report and the feasibility study for Kathmandu-Pokhara and Kathmandu-Lumbini railway lines. The Chinese team will conduct a field visit to Pokhara towards this end. (IANS)</p>
