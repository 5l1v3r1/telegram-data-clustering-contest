      <h1>Teacher Threw Away Students’ Black Lives Matter Posters, A.C.L.U. Says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:58:40+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:58</time> by <a rel="author">Sandra E. Garcia</a></address>
      <p>A school district near Sacramento, Calif., said it is investigating an episode in which a teacher threw away student posters related to the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
      <p>The district, the San Juan Unified School District in Carmichael, Calif., said in a statement that it apologized if any student felt “discomfort” about what happened, the television station <a href="https://www.kcra.com/article/sacramento-school-accused-of-discrimination-after-students-art-thrown-out/29883866">KCRA 3</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The episode, which took place in September, came to light on Thursday after the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Northern California <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/docs/11.21.19_FINAL_Public_Press_Ltr.pdf">sent the district a letter</a> detailing what happened.</p>
      <p>In the letter, the organization described how a parent volunteer taught a lesson about how “art can manifest in activism.”</p>
      <p>The parent volunteer asked the teacher if she could teach another art lesson about diversity. According to the letter, the teacher told her in front of a sixth-grade class that “his lessons would contain lessons with ‘a bunch of old white guys’ so her content may not fit.”</p>
      <p>The volunteer “was obviously confused, and a bit concerned regarding this comment, but did not stop the lesson plan” because of his comment, the letter said.</p>
      <p>She asked the students to create a poster that focused on something they wanted to see changed at the school. Four students created Black Lives Matter posters, Abre’ Conner, the lawyer at the A.C.L.U. who wrote the letter, said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The day after the posters were made by the students, the teacher told the parent volunteer that he threw them away because they were “inappropriate and political,” the letter said.</p>
      <p>The teacher asked her “whether students were getting shot at the school and demanded answers regarding why a presentation on Black Lives Matter was relevant” to the school, Del Paso Manor Elementary, the letter said.</p>
      <p>The letter identified the teacher only as Mr. Madden; <a href="https://www.sanjuan.edu/domain/1484">a school directory lists a David Madden</a> as a teacher. Ms. Conner would not identify the parent volunteer, who was referenced in the school district statement only as Ms. Kincaid. A Magali Kincaid is listed as a <a href="https://www.sanjuan.edu/cms/lib8/CA01902727/Centricity/domain/141/spsa/2016SPSA/2016-17_Single_Plan_For_Student_Achievement_Del_Paso_Manor_Elementary_School_20161118.pdf">parent or community member on the school’s website</a>.</p>
      <p>Neither Mr. Madden nor Ms. Kincaid could be reached on Sunday. Kent Kern, the school district superintendent, to whom the letter was addressed, also could not be reached.</p>
      <p>Ms. Kincaid went to the principal, who supported Mr. Madden, according to the letter. The principal said that Black Lives Matter posters are political statements and therefore were off limits for public display.</p>
      <p>Though not named in the letter, <a href="https://www.sanjuan.edu/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&amp;DomainID=4&amp;ModuleInstanceID=66051&amp;ViewID=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&amp;RenderLoc=0&amp;FlexDataID=44007&amp;PageID=1">Damon Smith is listed on the school’s website as its principal</a>. He could not be reached on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The A.C.L.U. argued that the Black Lives Matter posters were protected speech under the California Education Code because they convey a student’s thoughts, ideas and beliefs in the support of black lives. The group also said the posters were protected under the California Constitution.</p>
      <p>Ms. Conner wrote that “there are obvious problems with a teacher and principal who currently have black students in their classroom and school taking the positions that the acknowledgment of Black Lives is controversial and political in nature.”</p>
      <p>The district has not responded to the letter, Ms. Conner said.</p>
      <p>“Because these are so basic fundamental rights we believe that the school district at this point would have responded back to us,” she said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>In its statement, the district said the A.C.L.U. letter raised new assertions.</p>
      <p>“Ms. Kincaid was allowed to provide a lesson that was not prepared by the district’s art program and without having been trained,” it said. “That should have not occurred and unfortunately led to disagreement between Ms. Kincaid and the classroom teacher on the assignment’s final outcome.”</p>
      <p>The statement attributed the disagreement to a misunderstanding about the nature of the assignment.</p>
      <p>Mr. Madden’s “understanding of the resulting assignment was for students to produce artwork related to a change they wanted to see within the school itself,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>“Students whose artwork focused on large social issues, which varied in topic, and was not directly tied to the school, were asked by the teacher to complete another poster the next day,” it continued.</p>
      <p>The district said it was never its “intent or desire for any student to feel uncomfortable or unwelcome to discuss issues that are important to them.”</p>
      <p>It added: “Censoring a student’s assigned work because of its content would not be acceptable. We are open and committed to continuing our work with students, staff, community partners and others to ensure that our school communities embrace a diversity of thoughts and experiences.”</p>
      <p>The A.C.L.U. asked for, among other things, a curriculum and events that include the Black Lives Matter movement, parent engagement training. It also asked that school staff undergo cultural and sensitivity training with Ms. Kincaid’s input.</p>
      <p>“The moral here is that you have a teacher in your school district basically sending the message that if you create Black Lives Matter art work, it is literal trash,” Ms. Conner said.</p>
