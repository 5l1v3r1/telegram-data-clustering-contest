      <h1>Will Ferrell Leads an All-Star Cast in SNL's Take on the Democratic Debate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:06:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:06</time> by <a rel="author">Garrett Martin  </a></address>
      <p>So here’s a sketch from last night’s episode of <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Saturday+Night+Live">Saturday Night Live</a></i>, which was hosted by Will Ferrell. It’s a sketch about last week’s Democratic debate, and it goes exactly as you’d expect it to. Celebrity cameos abound, every candidate gets two or three lines to hammer home the show’s generally reductive depiction of each of them, and the whole sketch pretty much fails to make any smart or funny observations about the debate or the field of candidates. And yet it’s the most viewed and shared sketch from this week’s episode, because it’s the most buzzworthy—it’s the only sketch that has appearances from Ferrell, Maya Rudolph, <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Woody+Harrelson">Woody Harrelson</a>, Larry David, Fred Armisen and Rachel Dratch, after all. Yeah, there are current cast members in it too, but how are you supposed to notice that when fully half the actors in it are famous celebrities or returning <i>SNL</i> favorites?</p>
      <p>Anyway, people are watching it and sharing it, so let’s do it. Here it is. Watch the thing that over three million other people have already watched, and then imagine a time when Dana Carvey didn’t get to play George H.W. Bush because they kept bringing <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Dan+Aykroyd">Dan Aykroyd</a> back to do it instead.</p>
