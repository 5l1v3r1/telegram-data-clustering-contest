      <h2>The Barcelona star has been consistently linked with a move to Arsenal, with Gunners forward Alexandre Lacazette pleading with him in the summer to move to the Emirates</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:40:16+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:40</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> have been dealt a blow in their pursuit of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> defender <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/samuel-umtiti">Samuel Umtiti</a> , after he hinted at who his next club could be.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old has been a long-term target for the Gunners, who are desperate to solve their problems in defence.</p>
      <p>But Umtiti admitted to Spanish publication <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/umtiti-i-wouldnt-rule-out-returning-to-olympique-lyon-in-the-future-7749386">Sport</a> that he is interested in a move back to his former club Lyon.</p>
      <p>Speaking of his future plans, Umtiti said: "I'd like to be a coach. I take notes from those I've worked under, their training sessions and what they do.</p>
      <p>"Returning to Lyon is a possibility, as a player or as a coach."</p>

      <p>Umtiti spent five years with Lyon from 2011-16, before transferring to the Nou Camp in a £24.6 million deal.</p>
      <p>However it's unlikely he could be leaving Barca anytime soon.</p>
      <p>He is good friends with Arsenal forward Alexandre Lacazette, who pleaded for him to join the north London club in the summer.</p>
      <p>Umtiti said in response as recently as September: "Honestly, I don’t know where this rumour with Arsenal came from.</p>

      <p>"Overnight, I received messages from my friends saying, 'Ah, so you are joining Arsenal?' I’m not, I’m sorry but I’m staying at Barcelona."</p>
      <p>Asked whether there had been contact with Arsenal, Umtiti added: "To be honest, I don’t know if they had conversations with my agent, I just told him that I didn’t care what was happening this summer and that it wasn’t even necessary to talk to me about it.</p>
      <p>"It was useless, I was going to have the same answer. My dream as a child is to play for Barcelona."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Gunners fans have issued a strongly-worded statement accusing the Arsenal hierarchy of “rudderless” leadership which has left the club “floating aimlessly.”</p>
      <p>The angry backlash comes from the same set of supporters who issued a powerful online #WeCareDoYou campaign in July against owner Stan Kroenke and the club’s board.</p>
      <p>Kroenke’s son, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> director Josh, gave a powerful response to <i>Mirror Sport</i> urging fans to “get behind the team” while the club also backed Unai Emery with a summer spending spree which included club record £72m signing Nicolas Pepe.</p>
      <p>The fan statement does not directly call for under-pressure Emery to be sacked but, instead, takes aim at the Kroenke ownership and warns about falling attendances, a lack of direction on and off the pitch and the club losing its identity.</p>
