      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-styles/">Harry Styles</a> has revealed that he and his fellow <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/one-direction/">One Direction</a> bandmates had no idea that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/zayn-malik/">Zayn Malik</a> was unhappy during his time in the band before his departure.</p>
      <p>Zayn <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2015/03/25/zayn-malik-quits-one-direction-after-five-years-i-feel-like-it-is-now-the-right-time-for-me-to-leave-the-band-5120678/">chose to quit the group in March 2015</a> while they were performing on their On The Road Again tour, claiming that he wanted to live as a ‘normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight.’</p>
      <p>However, Harry has since admitted that because he and his bandmates were so busy with their tour, they were unaware of the now 26-year-old’s true feelings, while also stating that it was ‘sad’ to see his former bandmate leave.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Zane Lowe on Apple Music’s Beats 1 Radio, he said: ‘It was kind of like we were sad, obviously, that someone had left, but also sad that he was enjoying it so much that he had to leave.</p>

      <p>‘Because I think at the time too, the tour and everything was going so well and everyone had kind of got to this place where everyone was kind of living in a way where they felt pretty good. It felt like everyone was kind of enjoying it.</p>
      <p>‘I’d say a big part of it [Zayn leaving] was us kind of being like, “Wow.” You didn’t realise he wasn’t enjoying it that much.’</p>
      <p>He then admitted that it would have been unfair for him to carry on in the group if he did not want to continue to make music with them.</p>
      <p>‘Why would you want an artist to make stuff for you when they don’t want to make it?’ he questioned.</p>

      <p>It comes after fellow One Direction member Liam Payne recently said <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/25/liam-payne-says-zayn-malik-wont-involved-one-direction-reunion-shouldnt-10982298/">he does not believe that Zayn should be involved in a 1D reunion.</a></p>
      <p>When asked by Jonathan Ross on his talkshow if Zayn would ever rejoin the boyband again, Liam replied: ‘No, I don’t think that’ll ever happen.</p>
      <p>‘When he left, it wasn’t on great terms so I don’t feel like it’s a thing. If he didn’t want to be here, he shouldn’t be here, which is fine.’</p>
      <p>Harry <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/harry-styles-throws-shade-zayn-malik-thanking-simon-cowell-growing-one-direction-test-tubes-11169548/">also seemed to throw some shade at Zayn</a> during a recent appearance on Saturday Night Live.</p>

      <p>In his opening monologue, he said: ‘I don’t know if you heard or not, I’m not in a boyband anymore. I’m in a man band now.</p>
      <p>I was in a band called One Direction, how crazy would it be if they were here tonight? Well, they’re not. Wouldn’t it be crazy if they were though? They’re not.</p>
      <p>‘I love those guys, they’re my brothers.  Niall, Liam, Louis… and Ringo. Yeah, that’s it.’</p>
