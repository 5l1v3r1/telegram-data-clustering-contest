      <p>The young guy was excited. Maybe got a little too excited.</p>
      <p>With the game secure over the Detroit Lions — Redskins QB Dwayne Haskins decided to go over to the sidelines and celebrate with fans by talking selfies.</p>
      <p>Only problem here is that his job wasn’t done and the Redskins still had to officially end the game. Backup QB Case Keenum was called upon to come in and do that since Haskins was preoccupied.</p>
