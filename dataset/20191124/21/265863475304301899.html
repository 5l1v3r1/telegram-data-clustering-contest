      <h1>Justin Timberlake Photographed Holding Hands With Another Woman Without His Wedding Ring On!</h1>

      <p>Justin Timberlake was spotted holding hands with another woman that is not his wife Jessica Biel. Onlookers say things got very flirty but the latest reports claim that the two are nothing more than friends.</p>
      <p>Raising Dion star Alisha Wainwright was seen stroking the pop star’s knee and smiling before they held hands under the table of a New Orleans bar while on break from shooting a movie where they will play love interests.</p>
      <p>Witnesses claim that Timberlake was drunk and couldn’t walk straight. Although other cast and crew were at the same bar, The Sun originally reported that they were alone on The Absinthe House balcony for over half an hour and then left at the rear exit.</p>
      <p>Immediately after the pictures were released, social media started talking. Some feel that it could have been innocent while others feel that no matter what the situation was — a married man shouldn’t behave that way with another woman.</p>

      <p>The 38-year-old was wearing his ring earlier last week but it was absent from the photos, This could be because of the movie role.</p>
      <p>A rep for Alisha stated: ‘There is no validity to this speculation. They are currently working on a project together. Members of the cast and crew were all together.’</p>
      <p>Another source backed the statement claiming: ‘The video may look a way, but literally it was nothing. It was some friends, members of the team, crew and people like that. They all know each other and were hanging. Like come on, they’re on an open balcony in New Orleans and he’s famous. It was nothing.’</p>
      <p>The latest spotting of Jessica and Justin was on Halloween when she dressed up as the singer from his boy band days.</p>
      <p>Last month, he gushed to Entertainment Tonight about his marriage with the actress where he said that once you find ‘your person’ you can’t ‘go back.’</p>
