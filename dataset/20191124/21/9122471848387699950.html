      <h1>Video: Dwayne Haskins Gets Emotional After First NFL Win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:34:02+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Dwayne Haskins is a winner at the NFL level for the first time in his career. The rookie quarterback helped the Washington Redskins beat the Detroit Lions 19-16 this afternoon.</p>
      <p>After kicker Dustin Hopkins booted the game-winning field goal with just seconds remaining, Haskins could be seen excitedly congratulating Hopkins and his teammates. You could tell the win meant a lot to him, given the amount of struggles he’s had early on in his career.</p>
      <p>Below, you can see Haskins get emotional celebrating the W with his offensive coordinator and teammates.</p>

      <p>Haskins finished 13-of-29 passing for 156 yards, no touchdowns and an interception. He had some struggles on the afternoon, but did make the one big throw he had to.</p>
      <p>On a third down play on the game-winning drive, Haskins hooked up with his former Ohio State teammate Terry McLaurin to move into field goal range.</p>

      <p>Haskins still has a long way to go as an NFL quarterback, but he took an important step today notching his first W. Hopefully it allows him to settle down some in the final five weeks of the season.</p>
      <p>The Redskins play the Panthers, Packers and their three NFC East rivals to close the season, so things won’t be easy.</p>
