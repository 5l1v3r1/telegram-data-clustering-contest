      <p>Davao City—Billy Robles started the show while Bonbon Custodio completed it as the Davao Occidental Tigers thwarted the Manila Stars, 79-76, on Saturday in the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League Lakan Season at RMC Petro Gazz Arena here.</p>
      <p>The 6-foot Robles, dubbed the Ilonggo Superman, clustered five points, capped by the dagger three with 16 seconds left to power the Tigers to an 18-3 record, the best in the South division, and earn best player honors.</p>
      <p>Prior to Robles’ outburst, Custodio poured all of his 10 points as the Tigers sprang back to life after reeling from a 13-point opening salvo, nine coming from Chris Bitoon, that pushed the Stars ahead at 68-62.</p>
      <p>Robles wound up with 15 points, complementing the 16-point output of Emman Calo in the first half which the Tigers controlled, 40-31.</p>
      <p>Yvan Ludovice added 10 points as they compensated for Mark Yee’s failure to came up with his usual double-double, settling for 9 points and 9 rebounds against the Stars, who slid to 17-4 in the North division.</p>
      <p>Veteran Jerwin Gaco saw action for the Cocolife-backed Tigers and chipped in 4 points and 6 rebounds.</p>
      <p>The Stars hurt their chances with the ejection of assistant coach Ariel Vanguardia and players Gabby Espinas and Mark Tallo for unsportsmanlike behavior.</p>
      <p>The Batangas City Athletics, with Jhaymo Eguilos posting 25 points and 13 rebounds and Jason Melano tallying 26 points plus eight rebounds, hurdled the Mindoro Tamaraws, 106-99, in the opener.</p>
      <p>Prized recruit Rey Suerte, former University of Visayas stalwart and MVP of the Cebu Schools Athletic Foundation Inc. before spending one season with University of the East, contributed 15 points in the Tanduay-supported Athletics’ 13th win in 20 starts.</p>
      <p>The Tamaraws got 18 points from Mac Baracael, 17 from Sandy Cenal and 15 each from Nicol Bolos and Mark Anthony Doligon, but still fell to 8-16.</p>
