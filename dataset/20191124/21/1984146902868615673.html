      <p>Newcastle United finally return to action on Monday night at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>It has been a long international fortnight but Steve Bruce's side have an opportunity to break into the top ten if they defeat Aston Villa on Sky's Monday night football.</p>
      <p>Sunday's headlines were largely dominated by off-the-field matters, though - as Rafa Benitez gave another round of interviews and there was even a bizarre re-appearance of Peter Kenyon.</p>
      <p>Here are the top Newcastle United headlines on November 24.</p>
      <h3>Peter Kenyon's new takeover plan</h3>
      <p>According to the Sun, would-be Newcastle United owner was pictured at Charlton's Valley stadium with potential investors a couple of weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Roland Duchatelet is looking for £60million for the club and Kenyon, who has been involved in efforts to raise funds to broker a deal for Newcastle, has been organising one group of American investors, according to Alan Nixon.</p>
      <p>What that means for his potential interest in Newcastle - which is ongoing but has not progressed recently - is not clear but it does throw some doubt on it.</p>
      <p>Lee Ryder revealed today that Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is continuing to "plan for 2020" as if he will own the club. <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-united-takeover-ashley-kenyon-17307037">His full story is here</a> .</p>

      <h3>Rafa Benitez on Newcastle</h3>
      <p>Rafa Benitez revealed that he still has plenty of respect for Newcastle United as he re-appeared with a new interview in the Sunday Times and Mail on Sunday today.</p>
      <p>The piece, which included an anecdote about the meeting with Ashley that was the beginning of the end for their relationship, contained fresh quotes from Benitez about why he quit Newcastle.</p>
      <p>He also spoke of his legacy at the club. "People say, ‘They have to forget Rafa’ but no, the people there do not forget Kevin Keegan. They don’t forget the big names. I was giving everything for Newcastle from day one until the day I left," he said.</p>

      <h3>Ibrahima Sissoko deal 'should be done'</h3>
      <p>Another line from Nixon on Sunday, who claimed midfielder Ibrahima Sissoko's deal "should be done" but a fee hasn't been agreed as yet.</p>
      <p>Our information is that while there is interest in Sissoko, there are other targets. Newcastle are looking for a midfielder who can run games.</p>

      <h3>Dean Smith praises Newcastle</h3>
      <p>Villa boss Dean Smith is wary of Newcastle.</p>
      <p>"They've got pace and power up front. They are winning games - they've won the last couple - and they beat Manchester United at home as well. They are in a good run of form at the moment," he said.</p>
      <p>Here's his <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-boss-dean-smith-17308753">full thoughts on the Newcastle game</a> .</p>
      <h3>Steve Bruce drops Florian Lejeune injury return hint</h3>
      <p>Newcastle must make at least one change for the Aston Villa game as Jamaal Lascelles faces six weeks out.</p>
      <p>But with Ciaran Clark's return to Villa also in doubt due to a knock picked up on international duty, there may be a recall for Fabian Schar or Florian Lejeune, who has recovered from a cruciate ligament injury.</p>
      <p>Bruce said of Lejeune: "There comes a point where you can’t keep training and training and training; you have to be thrown into the deep end, if that’s the right word.</p>
      <p>"But (Lejeune) is a wonderful pro. He’s the first in, the last to go and he’s done everything he possibly can. He feels he’s ready, and I think that’s the most important thing — he knows his knee better than anybody. He’s done all his minutes and he’s ready to go."</p>
