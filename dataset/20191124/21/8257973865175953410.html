      <p>Nov. 24 (UPI) -- British Prime Minister <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Boris_Johnson/?tps=1">Boris Johnson</a> released an election manifesto for the Conservative party on Sunday pledging to complete Brexit and provide 50,000 more nurses in England.</p>
      <p>Johnson released the <a href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf">59-page manifesto</a>, which he described as a "partial blueprint" for the future of the country 18 days before the general election.</p>
      <p>During a speech launching the plan, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50532000">Johnson said</a> Britain has never faced a more "closely fought" contest.</p>
      <p>"Get Brexit done and we can focus our hearts and minds on the priorities of the British people," he said.</p>
      <p>In regards to Brexit, Johnson promised to reintroduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament before Dec. 25 and ruled out extending the transition period beyond the Dec. 31, 2020 deadline.</p>
      <p>The manifesto also promises there will be no political alignment with the European Union after the withdrawal and that Britain will have full control of its fishing waters.</p>
      <p>Johnson pledged to increase the number of nurses in the NHS England workforce by 50,000 by 2024-2025 with training 14,000 new graduates and undergraduates.</p>
      <p>In addition, the plan would seek to recruit 12,500 nurses from outside Britain and 19,000 from extra training places, and reintroducing maintenance grants for students.</p>
      <p>Independent fact-checking charity Full Fact reviewed the plan's proposals and calculated that adding 50,000 nurses would <a href="https://fullfact.org/election-2019/conservative-manifesto-2019/">cost $3.6 billion</a>.</p>
      <p>Other pledges include adding 20,000 more police officers to the force, a "triple tax lock" to prevent increases in income tax and national insurance for five years, and increased spending for school finding and childcare.</p>
