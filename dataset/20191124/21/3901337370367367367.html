      <p>Speaking to the media after the game, Notoane pointed out how he is hopeful he will have the backing of the association next year to prepare for the event.</p>
      <p>“We have to go back to the drawing board and prepare now for the bigger stage in the Olympic tournament in Tokyo, which comes in the period of July to August,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There is challenges, of course, there is a domestic league that is taking place, unlike in Egypt where the FA stops the professional league games from continuing, so if I check my calendar there is only one FIFA break so I hope that I will get support from the professional clubs to make sure that there is a lot of preparation matches and that we have the players available because our league will only end in May, so that is the big headache I am facing,” he added.</p>
