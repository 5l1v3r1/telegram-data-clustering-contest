      <p>Lauretta Onochie, an aide to President Muhammadu Buhari, has told Air Peace Airline boss Allen Onyema to return to the US to face fraud charges.</p>
      <p>Concise News had <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/23/allen-onyema-full-text-of-us-20m-fraud-allegations-against-air-peace-owner/">reported t</a>hat US government announced the allegations against Onyema on Friday, accusing him of “moving more than $20 million from Nigeria through United States bank accounts in a scheme involving false documents based on the purchase of airplanes.”</p>
      <p>Also, according to a statement from the US Justice Department, Onyema’s Chief of Administration and Finance, Ejiroghene Eghagha, has been charged with bank fraud and committing aggravated identity theft in connection with the scheme.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Saturday, <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/23/air-peace-owner-onyema-reacts-to-us-20m-fraud-allegations-against-him/">Onyema, however, denied</a> all the allegations, saying that all the money transfer for the purchase of aircraft passed through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).</p>
      <p>“Thank you for reaching out to me. I can confirm to you that all allegations are false and are in no way in line with my character as a person and as a businessman whose only aim has been to build Nigeria and improve well-being,” he said.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/23/nigerians-react-to-fraud-allegations-against-air-peace-boss-allen-onyema/">reacting</a> to the development, Onochie took to her Twitter handle to say that “American laws go after those who BREAK them” and urged him to go clear his name.</p>
      <p>She wrote:</p>
      <p>1. I do not understand what Pres. @MBuhari has to do with Mr Onyema of Airpeace being indicted and charged in the USA.</p>
      <p>According to our Attorney General, the Fed. Govt. has not even been informed of the situation.</p>
      <p>American laws go after those who BREAK them<br/>What a man sows….</p>
      <p>2. How much has Nigeria invested in the Niger Delta Amnesty Programme, NDDC &amp; 13% derivation funds? All, mostly in a black hole Do we know the extent of poverty, ignorance &amp; disease in the Niger Delta? Please let America too help us see how Niger Delta underdeveloped Niger Delta</p>
      <p>3. Those of us from the Niger Delta who are the direct beneficiaries of the sufferings that emanated from the looting of our wealth will tackle them. It’s our war that is being fought. Laws, Nigerian or American, go after those who break them so we must mind our business. QED!</p>
      <p>4. We are smarter now than ever before. Gradually, the scales of tribalism, religious affinity and political loyalty, are falling off our eyes and being replaced by Nigerianism. Nigerians are not keen on tales by the moonlight. Let him return to America and face his accusers!</p>
