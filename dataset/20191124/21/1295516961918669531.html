      <h1>Tony Hawk Reviews the Skateboarding in Amazing Spider-Man, Scott Pilgrim</h1>

      <p>Have you ever wondered what one of the most iconic skateboarders of all time thinks of how the sport is depicted in the larger-than-life world of superhero cinema? Well, extreme sports icon <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/tony-hawk/">Tony Hawk</a> himself may have some answers for you.</p>
      <p>Hawk recently participated in a "Breakdown" video with <a href="https://youtu.be/16g227KwNDM?t=756">GQ Sports</a>, during which he offered commentary on various skateboarding movies and skateboarding movie scenes. Among the films Hawk screened were two rather noteworthy comic book movies from the early 2010s: 2012's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-amazing-spider-man/">The Amazing Spider-Man</a> and 2010's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world/">Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</a>.</p>

      <p>When it came time to review <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i>, Hawk seemed to take issue with the fact that Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker was using his spider powers to stay firmly planted to his skateboard, no matter what. "You can see that his foot is attached to his board in an unnatural way," Hawk said. "So, definitely, his back foot right there is stuck to the board somehow, with something other than gravity. So, that's a tell right there, where it's like, 'All right, we're not in reality here.'"</p>
      <p>On that same note, Hawk commented on a clip in which Peter grabs a ledge, lifts himself off the ground and rotates his body before returning to the ground -- his board staying on his feet the whole time. "I actually know the stuntman who did that, William Spencer," he said.</p>

      <p>"He must have had the skateboard attached to the shoes. And to go around and do a backflip and be confident enough and skilled enough to know that you actually are going to land on your feet is pretty awesome. 'Cause that's risky. Imagine that you strapped a snowboard to your feet and someone threw you in a backflip. You gotta still kand it. And that's what he did... But, we know it's not real."</p>
      <p>Interestingly enough, Spider-Man was actually featured as a secret character in the 2000 video game <i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</i>. Speaking of which, when Hawk took a look at <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> later in the video, it seemed he got the impression the massive grind pulled off by Chris Evans' Lucas Lee would have been right at home in <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tony-hawk-favorite-game-revealed/">one of his games</a> -- which makes sense, given the cult-favorite comic book adaptation's video game influence.</p>

      <p>"He goes from one rail to the next, back to the other one and then into a 360 grab onto another rail," Hawk observed. "Yeah, see, now we're in video game territory. It just gets crazy. And I hate to say that this stuff's impossible, because I have seen someone actually go from one rail to the next, but in a very smaller setting. But to do it in such a massive area, like with such long stairs, such a long rail, we're way out of reality."</p>
      <p>Hawk concluded his thoughts on Scott Pilgrim by correcting its misuse of the term "bail" when Lucas ultimately crashed and burned, clarifying that a "bail" is an intentional spill a skater takes, whereas what happened to the skater-turned-actor is better described as an unintentional "slam." Other films Hawk reviewed as part of <i>GQ</i>'s video include <i>Back to the Future</i>, <i>Grind</i>, <i>Gleaming the Cube</i>, <i>Police Academy 4</i>, <i>Mid90s</i> and <i>Daddy's Home</i>.</p>
