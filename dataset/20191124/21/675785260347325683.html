      <p>One of sprint legend Jesse Owens’ gold medals from the Nazi Olympics is likely to sell for £1.6million.</p>
      <p>Owens, who won four golds in the 1936 Berlin Games, is credited with smashing Adolf Hitler’s myth of Aryan supremacy.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old American was the most successful athlete at the games, winning the 100m, 200m, long jump and 4×100m relay.</p>
      <p>The medals from the Berlin Games were not inscribed with the events so it is not known which gold is for sale.</p>

      <p>Owens gave it to US weightlifter John Terpak Snr, who later arranged speaking events for the runner who had been struggling to find work and earn in racially segregated America.</p>
      <p>It will be sold at auction in New Jersey next month.</p>
      <p>One gold sold for £1.1million in 2013. The whereabouts of the two other golds are unknown.</p>
