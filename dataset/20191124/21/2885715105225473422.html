      <h1>Delhi Confidential: The Unnamed MLAs</h1>
      <h2>While the court noted that Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and the BJP were not represented, the arguments advancing the party’s position were made by the unnamed MLAs.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:48:52+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>IN A repeat of the 2018 Supreme Court hearing in the Karnataka government formation case, a “group of independent <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bharatiya-janata-party/">Bharatiya Janata Party</a> legislators” got a hearing in the apex court on Sunday in connection with the government formation in Maharashtra. Curiously, in both cases, the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> MLAs remained unnamed and former Attorney General and senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi appeared for them. While the court noted that Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a> and the BJP were not represented, the arguments advancing the party’s position were made by the unnamed MLAs.</p>

        <b>Expanding Office</b>
      </p>
      <p>THE BJP, which is keen to expand its footprints across the country, seems to be in a mood to expand its space in Parliament Building too. The room between BJP’s parliamentary party office and the room used by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/atal-bihari-vajpayee">Atal Bihari Vajpayee</a> and L K Advani was allotted to the TDP. However, with the TDP shrinking in size, it has been officially slotted for the YSRCP, although the TDP is not in a mood to vacate it immediately. But the small office attached to the TDP’s room is locked out and the party MPs are using only the main hall. Sources said the BJP wants to extend its office to this room, which would give them more space and a smooth passage in between its two rooms. The BJP’s argument is that neither the TDP nor YSRCP requires such a vast space inside the complex whereas with 303 MPs, it needs that space.</p>

        <b>Staying Away</b>
      </p>
      <p>AFTER SEVERAL requests and reminders for restoring Internet connection on the campus of National Institute of Technology in Srinagar, the J&amp;K administration finally restored partial access to Internet. This, however, may not lead to final-year students coming back soon. A large number of fourth-year students have left the institute to prepare for GATE examination and for job placements. Since, there is no WiFi access on campus even now, students who left to prepare for GATE may not come back.</p>
