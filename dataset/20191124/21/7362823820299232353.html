      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:45:57+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:45</time> by <a rel="author">Sasha Savitsky</a></address>
      <p>It was not love at first sight for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kristen-bell">Kristen Bell</a> and Dax Shepard.</p>
      <p>The "Good Place" actress said in a new interview that she met her future husband at a small dinner party where she was turned off by how he could not stop talking.</p>
      <p>"I was like, ‘This guy can talk’,” she said in an interview airing on “Sunday Today,” per <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/22/kristen-bell-didnt-feel-sparks-when-she-first-met-dax-shepard/">Page Six</a>. "I didn’t know who he was. I was like, maybe one of the guys from ‘Jackass’ or something?… and then we left. There were no sparks whatsoever. None."</p>

      <p>But it was at their second encounter that things began to change for Bell.</p>
      <p>“Two weeks later we both met at a hockey game … started to flirt, left, and then a day after that I get a text that says, ‘Hi my name is Dax. I violated your privacy and got your number from [a mutual friend]. How do you feel about that?'”</p>
      <p>And it was Shepard's sense of humor that eventually won her over.</p>

      <p>“He knows what he’s doing,” she said. “He’s so bold and that was my kind of person. I was like, ‘OK, starting it off with a really good joke that makes me feel like butterflies.'”</p>
      <p>She added, "I fell in love with him way before he fell in love with me."</p>
      <p>The couple started dating in 2007 and married in 2013. They share two daughters.</p>
