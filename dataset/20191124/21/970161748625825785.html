      <p>Stormzy has revealed he had the ‘greatest conversation’ of his life with both <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/beyonce-knowles/">Beyonce</a> and Jay Z – and now he wants to collaborate with the two.</p>
      <p>The rapper, real name Michael Omari, has admitted that he is desperate to work with the couple after getting the chance to meet them in person – although he’s keeping tight lipped as to what their conversation was about.</p>
      <p>‘It was the greatest conversation of my life. One day I’ll reveal it,’ he teased to <a href="https://www.qthemusic.com/">Q Magazine.</a> ‘One day we’ll talk about it. It’s what I started my Glasto performance with, a clip of it.’</p>
      <p>And although the 26-year-old hopes to spend some time with Bey and Jay Z in the recording studio, he is aware that they are ‘very busy people’.</p>
      <p>When asked about the possibility of a future collaboration, he replied: ‘I don’t know about that. They’re very busy people. But God willing.’</p>

      <p>And although he is keeping pretty quiet about the majority of his conversation with them, Stormzy did include a clip of it at the beginning of his Glastonbury Festival headlining set earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The snippet of their conversation involves Jay Z telling Stormzy about the importance of culture, as he says: ‘It’s important for you to take that and say, “Okay, how can I create a culture around this whole thing?” Because culture moves the whole world.’</p>

      <p>The Big For Your Boots hitmaker later took to Instagram after his set to thank the 49-year-old for his words of wisdom, as he hailed him the ‘greatest rapper to ever grace planet Earth’.</p>
      <p>‘I got to open my set with words of encouragement from my hero and ultimate inspiration and the greatest rapper to ever grace planet Earth, Jay Z,’ he wrote.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Stormzy also revealed that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/stormzy-thought-glastonbury-set-bad-cried-hour-afterwards-11186069/">he thought his Glastonbury set was so bad, that he cried ‘for an hour’ after he left the stage.</a></p>

      <p>He revealed that his in-ear monitors ‘blew’ 20 minutes into his set on the Pyramid Stage, leaving him without sound for the rest of the performance.</p>
      <p>‘It was the most difficult thing I’ve ever done. When I walked off stage I thought I’d f****d it,’ he said.</p>

      <p>‘I thought it was the worst thing I’d ever done. I came off stage and thought I’d totally, absolutely blown it. I was crying, for, like, an hour. I was in hysterics. Heartbroken, man.’</p>
      <p>However, he later realised that we had no idea his in-ears had broken after Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis gave him a memory stick containing his set.</p>
