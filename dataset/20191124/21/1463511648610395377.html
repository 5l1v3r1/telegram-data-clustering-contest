      <h1>Insecurity: Nigeria needs to fix identified security lacunae – Adeka</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:41:19+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:41</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>Brig.-Gen. Muhammed Adeka (rtd.) has called for the repositioning of the nation’s security architecture through the fixing of identified security lacuna at all tiers of government.</p>
      <p>Adeka, a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Intelligence and Cyber Security at the Nigeria Defence Academy, Kaduna, made the call on Sunday in Ibadan.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the retired military officer spoke at the 2019 National Convention of the Moshood Abiola Polytechnic, Abeokuta Muslim Alumni.</p>
      <p>Adeka, the Keynote Speaker, in his lecture entitled ‘Economic Security as a Solution to National Insecurity’, noted that there was an urgent need to fill the identified security lacuna at state and local government levels.</p>
      <p>He said that such would ensure that there was no official security negligence at all levels of government in the country.</p>
      <p>According to him, there is also the need to focus on sponsors of violent crimes more than their foot soldiers.</p>
      <p>Adeka said that such would be more cost-effective, both in time and resources, to chase the identified sponsors of terrorism than fighting the foot soldiers alone.</p>
      <p>Prof. Abideen Olaiya, a lecturer at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, called for national economic rebirth to avert the ugly trend in the nation’s economy.</p>
      <p>Olaiya, who was the guest lecturer at the event, blamed the current trend on corruption, cyber-crime, unemployment, hunger, anger and prevalence of ignorance, among others.</p>
      <p>The don also bemoaned what he called the alarming rate of oppression in the country from the wealthy class.</p>
      <p>“In Islamic Economics, God gave rights of custodian to the wealthy individuals, but never permitted them to use such in punishing the less- privileged ones in the society,” he said.</p>
      <p>He listed oppression, cheating, lack of openness and communication as some of the factors affecting the security of the nation.</p>
      <p>Alhaji Taofik Salako, MAPAMA National President, said that the theme of the convention was part of their contributions to the national discourse.</p>
      <p>He said that it was aimed at enhancing the growth and development of the nation.</p>
      <p>“There is no doubt that Nigerians and friends of Nigeria must join hands with government in finding and implementing workable solutions to our quest for peace, progress, justice and unity.”</p>
      <p>Salako stressed the need for governments at all levels to take more drastic measures towards reducing the “mind-boggling and unnecessary wasteful monetisation of the nation’s political system”.</p>
      <p>He called on President Muhammadu Buhari to make use of his second term to implement far-reaching policies and reforms to redirect the political system.    </p>
