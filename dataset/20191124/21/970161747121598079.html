      <p>Lyra Belacqua (Dafne Keen) has proven herself to be quite the trickster and thinks fast on her feet in the latest episode of His Dark Materials.</p>
      <p>Heading to the North, Lyra manages to win over the trust of troublesome traveller Lee Scorseby (Lin Manuel Miranda) as well as an armoured bear, Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Sir Ian McKellen).</p>
      <p>As her quest to track down Roger continues, the world around her is seemingly preparing for war, and as time goes on, it looks like she’ll be the centre of it all.</p>
      <p>So what exactly is to happen next for our heroine and her new rag-tag team of detectives and helpers?</p>
      <p>Here are just some of the questions we have as we wait patiently for the next episode…</p>

      <h3>What is Lee Scoresby up to?</h3>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>There seems to be more to Scoresby than meets the eye, and he hasn’t got a reputation of attracting trouble for nothing.</p>
      <p>Keen to earn a quick buck with his hare daemon in tow, it appears that he has been charmed round by the cunning and quick-witted Lyra by the end of the episode.</p>
      <p>But he also doesn’t seem like the kind of man to agree to something without plans to get something for himself out of it.</p>
      <p>So what’s he up to? And should Lyra be scared?</p>

      <h3>Will someone tell on Lyra and her alethiometer?</h3>
      <p>For someone who was given something to take care of and keep secret, Lyra’s really done a poor job of actually doing that.</p>
      <p>In fact, in this episode alone she shows off the restricted item to several people, as well as her natural abilities to cast questions to it, while others take weeks to decipher its meanings.</p>
      <p>Maybe she probably shouldn’t be doing that if people are after her? Just a suggestion.</p>
      <p>As more people discover what she has on her side, will someone come after her and take it away from her? If so, what will she do then?</p>

      <h3>Where is Lord Asriel?</h3>
      <p>Seriously, after proving himself to be rude as hell and a bit of a snob back in Oxford in episode one, Asriel (James McAvoy) upped and left, never to be seen since.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>It was said that he had gone North, but we’re now in the North and it doesn’t seem like he’s been anywhere nearby recently.</p>
      <p>So where the hell has he gone and what’s dust got to do with it?</p>
      <p>Wherever he is, he’s a wanted man, and it doesn’t look like he’ll be appreciated much if Mrs Coulter (Ruth Wilson) gets her hands on him…</p>

      <h3>What is Mrs Coulter up to?</h3>
      <p>It’s official: Coulter has gone well and truly rogue and she’s not entirely working for the Magisterium anymore.</p>
      <p>She’s playing under that facade sure, but she’s clearly become obsessed with Lyra, and with Asriel.</p>
      <p>While we’d love to say that it was down to some sort of misguided maternal instincts on her part now we know she’s Lyra’s mum, but somehow we doubt.</p>
      <p>This is a woman on her own mission by any means necessary…what the hell is she doing?</p>

      <h3>Where next for the Gyptians?</h3>
      <p>Despite their best efforts, the Gyptians don’t appear to be any-the-wiser as to the location of the missing children.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>However, they are definitely not to be messed with, and now they’re continuing their quest.</p>
      <p>How far are they going to go to retrieve the youngest of their team, and will they be able to trust the growing number of outsiders in their clan?</p>
