      <h1>Arsenal and Liverpool enter chase for Premier League ace</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:16:46+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:16</time> by <a rel="author">Jaikuran Randhawa</a></address>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10413236/wolves-otasowie-transfer-arsenal-psg-liverpool/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574616724">the Sun</a>, Wolves youngster Owe Otasowie is attracting the interest of some top European clubs after his breakthrough into the Midlands outfit’s Under-23s side this season.</p>
      <p>The Sun report that the centre-back attracting the interest of Paris Saint-Germain and Bundesliga giants Schalke, as well as Premier League powerhouses Arsenal and Liverpool.</p>
      <p>News of PSG’s interest in the defender comes after his solid performance against them in the Premier League International Cup.</p>
      <p>As per <a href="https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2019/11/21/wolves-fans-owen-otasowie-v-psg-pl-intl-cup/">HITC</a>, some Wolves fans were massively impressed with the ace’s display.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old’s contract with the Wanderers expires this summer, as per the Sun, so top European outfits would be able to seal the ace’s signature for little compensation.</p>
      <p>Otasowie is eligible to represent England, Nigeria or the USA.</p>

      <p>Otasowie made one appearance for the United States’ Under-18s last summer but the Sun add that the defender is yet to decided on his international future.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the talented ace will pledge his international allegiance once he’s hopefully broken into Wolves’ first-team.</p>
      <p>Otasowie can also play as a defensive midfielder and he’s only broken into Wolves’ Under-23s side this season. The youngster has four Premier League 2 appearances to his name, as well as two outings in the EFL Trophy under his belt.</p>
