      <p>Police have launched an investigation after a referee was allegedly knocked unconscious during a non-league match.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred during Saturday's Surrey South Eastern Combination Intermediate League Division Two match between AFC Sutton Common Rovers and Sporting 50 FC.</p>
      <p>Medical aid was immediately called for the referee, although he did not have to go to hospital.</p>
      <p>The match, which took place at Goals Tolworth, was abandoned following the 85th minute incident, and both clubs condemned what happened.</p>
      <p>A Metropolitan Police spokesman told Sky Sports News: "Police are investigating reports that a man in his 40s was assaulted while refereeing a football match at a sports ground in Surbiton.</p>

      <p>"Officers were called to the venue in Kingston Road, Tolworth, at 15.16hrs on Saturday, 23 November.</p>
      <p>"London Ambulance Service treated the man at the scene. His injuries are non life-threatening.</p>
      <p>"The suspects had left the ground by the time of the officers' arrival. There are no arrests at this time and enquiries continue."</p>
      <p>The Surrey South Eastern Combination has said that it will cooperate with police and the Surrey FA in its investigations.</p>
      <p>Referees facing abuse is a big problem in the game at all levels.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-48573592">BBC</a> reported on a 14-year-old referee who suffered a nervous breakdown after being verbally abused on the pitch.</p>

      <p>According to the teenager's mother, the youngster was left "shaking head-to-toe and crawled from the bed to the bathroom" as a result of the incident at a youth tournament in Nottinghamshire.</p>
      <p>She added: "It was like a brain injury, I was very terrified. The symptoms were so severe medics thought they may have a brain tumour."</p>
