      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Latest on the American Music Awards, being presented Sunday at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles (all times local):</p>
      <p>6:25 p.m.</p>
      <p>Billie Eilish has picked up new artist of the year at the American Music Awards after a fiery performance of her song “all the good girls go to hell” surrounded by flames both real and projected on giant screens.</p>
      <p>Eilish, who also won favorite alternative artist earlier in the broadcast, thanked her creative team for letting her do whatever she wanted “pretty much all of the time.”</p>
      <p>She sang with her brother, Finneas O’Connell, wearing an oversized shirt that read “No Music on a Dead Planet” and ended the performance hovering above the crowd staring into the camera on a tall elevator lift.</p>

      <p>5:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Grammy-nominee Lizzo — perhaps the most memeable artist of the year — has become the talk of the American Music Awards with her red carpet look that included a minuscule Valentino purse that could hold a single breath mint.</p>
      <p>Dressed in a ruffled peach custom Valentino mini dress, the “Truth Hurts” singer said on the carpet on Sunday that there were only three in the world. Nominated for new artist of the year, she performed her kiss-off song “Jerome” during the awards show as fans lit up the theater.</p>
      <p>Her tiny purse became a running joke on Twitter, with some users joking about what it could hold (their patience, hopes for 2020) and what it couldn’t hold: the number of AMA trophies fans hoped Lizzo would win.</p>

      <p>Selena Gomez has opened the American Music Awards with a colorful performance of two new songs “Lose You To Love Me” and “Look At Her Now,” backed by a group of dancers.</p>
      <p>Gomez hasn’t released a new album since 2015’s “Revival,” but dropped these two songs ahead of the awards show performance on Sunday, which is airing live on ABC from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles. Taylor Swift and Halsey were shown on camera dancing and singing along in the audience.</p>
      <p>The show was hosted by Ciara, who entered the stage from a gold hoop dropped down from the ceiling and sang her song “Melanin.”</p>

      <p>7:52 a.m.</p>
      <p>All eyes will be on Taylor Swift at the 2019 American Music Awards.</p>
      <p>The pop star, who has continued to publicly battle with the men who own her master recordings, is set to take the stage at Sunday’s show — a performance she recently said was put in jeopardy by Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun. Swift could also make history at the AMAs if she surpasses Michael Jackson’s record for most wins.</p>
      <p>Swift, who has won 23 AMAs, is nominated for five awards and could best the King of Pop’s 24 wins. She will also receive the artist of the decade award, to be presented by Carole King, at the show, which airs live on ABC at 8 p.m. EDT.</p>
      <p>Other performers include Lizzo, Billie Eilish, Post Malone and Selena Gomez.</p>
