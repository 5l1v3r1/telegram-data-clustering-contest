      <h1>Australia win first Test against Pakistan in Brisbane</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:29:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:29</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>BRISBANE, Australia (AFP) – Australia beat Pakistan by an innings and five runs in the first Test in Brisbane to go 1-0 up in the two match series on Sunday.</p>
      <p>After trailing the hosts by 340 runs on the first innings, Pakistan were bowled out for 335 late on the fourth day.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Azam reached his second Test century and his first in Australia with an impressive knock.</p>
      <p>The elegant right-hander had been in excellent form in the lead-up games but was out to a disappointing shot in the first innings for just one.</p>
      <p>However, he was a different player in the second innings and never looked in any trouble until he edged Nathan Lyon to Tim Paine to fall for 104.</p>
      <p>It was Azam’s second century in 22 Tests following hie maiden ton against New Zealand in Dubai in November last year.</p>
      <p>He shared partnerships of 68 with Shan Masood and 132 with Rizwan as Pakistan battled hard throughout the first two sessions.</p>
      <p>Rizwan, playing just his second Test, brought up his first Test half-century off 86 balls with nine boundaries.</p>
      <p>His 42-run partnership with Yasir came in quick time off only 48 balls as they looked to put the pressure back onto the Australians.</p>
      <p>After resuming their second innings at 64 for three at the start of day four, Masood and Azam showed great commitment to frustrate the Australian attack.</p>
      <p>The Pakistan pair looked comfortable from the beginning and brought up their 50-run partnership midway through the first hour’s play.</p>
      <p>But on 42 Masood tried to hook a Pat Cummins short ball and got a thin edge to Australian wicketkeeper Paine to leave the visitors 93 for four.</p>
      <p>One run later Paine was in the action again when new batsman Iftikhar Ahmed was squared up by a beautiful ball from Josh Hazlewood and could only manage to edge it through to the Australian captain.</p>
      <p>The second Test begins in Adelaide on November 29.</p>
