      <h1>Tom Herman Has Brutally Honest Admission After Loss To Baylor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:07:22+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Texas’ 2019 regular season could not have been much more disappointing. The Longhorns dropped to 6-5 on the season with Saturday’s loss to Baylor. Tom Herman’s team needs to beat Texas Tech in Week 14 to avoid a .500 season.</p>
      <p>Herman was in a somber mood following Saturday night’s loss to Baylor.</p>
      <p>The Texas head coach took the blame for what’s transpired this season.</p>
      <p>“I’ve done a poor job and the buck stops with me. We’ll evaluate everything,” Herman told reporters.</p>

      <p>Texas entered the season with Big 12 championship and College Football Playoff hopes. The Longhorns haven’t come close to fulfilling those expectations.</p>
      <p>Hopefully Year 4 of the Herman era can go better in Austin.</p>
      <p>Texas will look to end Year 3 on a high note with a win over Texas Tech. The game will kick off at noon E.T. on FOX.</p>
