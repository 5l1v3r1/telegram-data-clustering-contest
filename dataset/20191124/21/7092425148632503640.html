      <p>He has since passed away at Beaumont Hospital, due to "a number of apparent gunshot wounds."Â </p>
      <p>The shooting took place on Clonshaugh Avenue in Dublin 17 at approximately 5:15pm on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Gardai are appealing for witnesses to come forward with any relevant information.</p>
      <p>A garda spokesperson said:</p>
      <p>"Gardai are appealing for witnesses to come forward, they are also appealing to anyone with camera footage from the vicinity of Clonshaugh Avenue between 4.30pm and 5.30pm today to make it available to investigators.</p>
