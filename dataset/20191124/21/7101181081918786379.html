      <h1>Harry Morton, Pink Taco Founder and Lindsay Lohan's Ex, Dead at 38</h1>

      <p>Harry Morton, the founder of the Pink Taco restaurant chain, was found dead in his Beverly Hills home on Saturday afternoon, a spokesperson for the Beverly Hills Police Department confirmed to ET.</p>
      <p>A source familiar with the situation tells ET<i> </i>that the 38-year-old restaurateur was discovered by his younger brother, Matthew. The Beverly Hills Police Department spokesperson said there was no evidence of foul play and an autopsy report is pending.</p>
      <p>Morton is the son of business tycoon Peter Morton, the co-founder of Hard Rock Cafe and Hotels, and the grandson of Arnie Morton, founder of Morton’s The Steakhouse. In addition to starting Pink Taco, which has locations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston and Las Vegas, he also once owned the Viper Room nightclub in West Hollywood and is an investor in Beacher’s Madhouse.</p>

      <p>In 2006, Morton dated Lindsay Lohan, but was also romantically linked throughout the years to other stars including Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. </p>
      <p>Morton made headlines in March for purchasing the Beverly Hills home that was once owned by Elvis and Priscilla Presley for $25 million, though <i>TMZ</i> reports that this is not the house where he was found dead. </p>
