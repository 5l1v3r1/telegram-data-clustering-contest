      <p>CHICAGO – The last time the Giants sunk this low, team owner John Mara wanted to fire everyone.</p>
      <p>Five years later, ownership’s silence is broken only by <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/jason-garrett-prefers-the-giants-if-he-and-pat-shurmur-get-fired-report/">reports of Cowboys coach Jason Garrett</a> being a possible replacement for Pat Shurmur and the thud made from bottoming out with a seventh consecutive loss.</p>
      <p>The Giants gave away points, committed costly turnovers and surrendered chunk plays on defense to a struggling quarterback in need of saving from himself. So, all of the same mistakes they made for months before a bye week returned in a 19-14 loss to the Bears at Soldier Field on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The seven-game losing streak is the longest for the Giants since 2014 under Tom Coughlin. After that seventh loss, Mara fumed on the bus but ultimately stuck with his two-time Super Bowl-winning coach for one more season. Shurmur has earned no such benefit of the doubt with a 7-20 mark in two seasons.</p>
      <p>The Giants (2-9) last lost more than seven in a row (nine) in a single season in 1976.</p>
      <p>Under siege as a bust drafted ahead of Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson in 2017, Bears quarterback Mitch Trubisky looked dreadful as the Bears failed to score on their first six possessions and fell behind 7-0. It could’ve — should’ve? — been at least 13-0.</p>
      <p>Giants kicker Aldrick Rosas missed field goals of 42 and 43 yards — blame Zak DeOssie’s ground-ball snap for one — while Trubisky threw a red-zone interception only a few plays after uncovered tight end Ben Braunecker dropped a would-be touchdown by letting the ball hit him in his face mask.</p>

      <p>The Bears also had a 60-yard gain negated by penalty and shanked multiple kicks to set up the Giants, whose average starting field position on the first six possessions was 5 yards shy of midfield.</p>
      <p>The comedy of errors gave way to a legitimate offensive game plan when the Bears zeroed in on the Giants young secondary, particularly rookie slot cornerback Corey Ballentine. They scored 19 consecutive points on four straight possessions, beginning with a field goal to close the first half.</p>
      <p>Ballentine got turned around in the slot and allowed a 32-yard go-ahead touchdown reception to Allen Robinson. It looked like Ballentine lost his place on the field, too, as he slowed down and then went for a strip rather than making the tackle before the goal line.</p>
      <p>On the next series, Ballentine allowed three straight completions covering 84 total yards, but the Giants tightened up on three red-zone passes to hold the Bears to a field goal and a 13-7 lead.</p>
      <p>It didn’t matter. The Giants’ listless offense already was dead against this pass-rushing defense.</p>
      <p>Khalil Mack beat left tackle Nate Solder around the outside and strip-sacked Daniel Jones, who lost a fumble for the fifth straight game. Unlike what happened to Jones in the previous three games, however, the defense didn’t return it for a touchdown but Trubisky punched the ball in on a draw.</p>
      <p>After Jones threw a stunning touchdown to Golden Tate on fourth-and-18, the Giants used all three timeouts on defense before the two-minute warning. Facing fourth-and-2 from their own 33-yard line, the Bears deceivingly kept the offense on the field for a moment — before running on the punt unit.</p>
      <p>The Giants were caught flat-footed with their defense on the field and no returner, so cornerback Janoris Jenkins dropped back and let the ball bounce over his head. The Bears saved it from the end zone and downed it at the 5-yard line.</p>
      <p>The Giants converted one fourth down before turning it over on downs.</p>
