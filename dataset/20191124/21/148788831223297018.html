      <h1>‘Friday Night Lights’ Reboot Finds New Coaches in The Dowdle Brothers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T21:00:59+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/chris-evangelista/" target="_blank">Chris Evangelista</a></address>
      <p>Just in case you forgot, that<b> <i>Friday Night Lights</i></b> reboot movie is still in the works, and it has a new creative team. <b>John Erick</b> and <b>Drew Dowdle</b>, known collectively as<b> The Dowdle Brothers</b>, have been tasked with making this potentially bad idea happen. Rather than follow-up the original <i>Friday Night Lights</i> movie, or connect to the popular TV series in any way, this new <i>Friday Night Lights</i> will tell a brand new story.</p>
      <p><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/fright-night-lights-movie-dowdle-brothers-1203412419/">Variety</a> has the new info on the <i>Friday Night Lights</i> reboot I bet you forgot about. The Dowdle Brothers, John Erick and Drew Dowdle, are now handling the project, with both doing a new polish on the script (which was written by David Gordon Green and Josh Parkinson), and John Erick directing and Drew executive producing. Per Variety, “the movie is not a sequel to Universal’s 2004 film starring Billy Bob Thornton, nor is it based on NBC’s TV series with Kyle Chandler. Instead, it’s a new property, though still focused on H.G. Bissinger’s non-fiction book about the 1988 Permian High School Panthers as the new Texas football team makes a run toward the state championship.”</p>
      <p>The Dowdle Brothers’ credits include the underseen found-footage horror flick <i>The Poughkeepsie Tapes</i>, the <i>Rec</i> remake <i>Quarantine</i>, and <i>As Above, So Below</i> (another found-footage horror film). The fact that the duo have trafficked primarily in the horror genre is a bit interesting, since <i>Friday Night Lights</i> doesn’t fit in with that at all. Are we getting a <i>Friday Night Lights</i> horror movie? No, we’re not – although I would gladly watch that. Call it <i>Friday Nightmare on Elm Street Lights</i> or something. Feel free to use that, Dowdle Brothers!</p>
      <p>H.G. Bissinger’s book followed the Permian Panthers of Odessa – “the winningest high-school football team in Texas history.” The book was adapted into a 2004 film by Peter Berg, and while that movie wasn’t a smash hit, it was enough to inspire a TV series of the same name. The series had a devoted fan-following and burned “Clear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose” into the pop culture lexicon. But will audiences want a whole new version of this story? Wouldn’t they be more inclined to watch a movie that, at the very least, brought back Kyle Chandler’s coach character? I guess we’ll find out.</p>
