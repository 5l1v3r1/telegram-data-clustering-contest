      <h1>​New Xiaomi Mi Band tracker lands – but you won’t be able to buy it</h1>
      <h2>Unless you live in India, of course</h2>

      <p>Xiaomi has released a new edition of its eternally popular <a href="https://www.wareable.com/xiaomi/xiaomi-mi-band-4-review-7446">Mi Band fitness tracker</a> – but it’s heading for India only.</p>
      <p>The Xiaomi Mi Smart Band 3i is a rehashing of the previous generation fitness tracker, but at an even lower price. It’s set to retail for ₹1,299, which translates to around $18.</p>
      <p>However, this new tracker isn’t simply Xiaomi flogging its old stock. The Mi Smart Band 3i loses the heart rate monitor to keep prices super low.</p>
      <p>However, the rest of the package is much the same. It still has a 0.7-inch AMOLED display with a 128 x 80 resolution, and it’s rated at 5ATM so you can take it for a dip. It will show calls and alert you to notifications – and will last around 20 days on a single charge.</p>

      <p>Xiaomi’s cut price fitness trackers have been a runaway success and have made it a powerhouse in the wearables market.</p>
      <p>But that volume has generally come from the huge market it’s carved out in China – and then the rest. This release of the Mi Band 3i shows its best set to do the same in developing markets, too.</p>

      <p>So where next for Xiaomi? Well, make sure you keep an eye on the <a href="https://www.wareable.com/smartwatches/xiaomi-mi-watch-release-date-price-features-7747">Xiaomi Mi Watch</a>, which was announced last month and is the company’s first attempt at unseating the Apple Watch’s huge market share.</p>

      </p>
      <p>That could be a challenge given the much larger $185 price tag, which doesn’t represent the same value for money that helped the company make the Mi Band such a huge success.</p>
