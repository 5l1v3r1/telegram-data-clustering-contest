      <p>“We thought we’d add a bit of excitement and flair to the car wash to create some interest,” the 23-year-old said.</p>
      <p>Mr Morton said the mates had raised close to $1500 for Movember in just three hours at North Sydney.</p>
      <p>“It may have been a fun day with the boys, but it’s also about bringing awareness to men’s mental health,” he said.</p>

      <p>“Many men are dying at younger ages these days due to things like suicide, depression and cancer. It scares me that I could lose one of my mates ­because of this.”</p>
      <p>As a youth worker, Mr Morton has dedicated his life to helping others through youth organisation Reach Foundation and his online blog What’s Life About?</p>
      <p>“A lot of young guys are too scared to come forward ­because there’s still that stigma around mental health issues. I really hope to change that,” he said.</p>

      <p>His friend John Chapman was prompted to confide how tough he found his father’s­ ­battle with prostate cancer.</p>
      <p>“His dad is doing really well now, but it still affects John,” Mr Morton said.</p>
      <p>“I’m so glad I have mates who can be a little crazy sometimes, but can pause and reflect on what’s going on in their lives.”</p>
      <p>Mr Morton said growing a Mo can help save a life. “A moustache is a great conversation starter because it forces people to ask questions. That’s a great first start,” he said.</p>
