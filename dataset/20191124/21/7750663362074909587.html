      <h1>Newcastle United want Hull City star Jarrod Bowen?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/newcastle-united/"><b>Newcastle United</b></a> are reportedly considering making a move for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/hull-city/"><b>Hull City</b></a> star <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jarrod-bowen/"><b>Jarrod Bowen</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The 22-year-old took his tally for the season to 12 in all competitions with a brace on Sunday in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/championship/middlesbrough-vs-hull-city_game_93265.html">a 2-2 draw against Middlesbrough</a> at the Riverside Stadium.</p>
      <p>Bowen's current contract with the Tigers expires at the end of the season, but <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/grant-mccann/"><b>Grant McCann</b></a>'s side have the option of extending his current deal by another season.</p>
      <p>The <i>Daily Star</i> reports that while Hull are planning to offer him improved terms in a bid to keep him at the KC Stadium until 2022, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/steve-bruce/"><b>Steve Bruce</b></a>'s Newcastle are considering making an offer for the dynamic attacker.</p>
      <p>The Magpies are believed to be contemplating testing the Humberside club's resolve in January with an offer but that they are also happy to wait until the summer before making a concerted effort to sign Bowen.</p>
      <p>Bruce has signed Bowen once before in his managerial career, bringing him from non-league Hereford to the Tigers back in 2014.</p>
