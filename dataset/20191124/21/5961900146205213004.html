      <p><b>Justin Timberlake</b> has been caught in an alleged cheating scandal after reportedly being photographed holding hands with co-star <b>Alisha Wainwright</b>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10409561/justin-timberlake-holds-hands-alisha-wainwright-strokes-knee-boozy/">The Sun obtained exclusive video</a> and photos of the pair hanging out at the bar in New Orleans where they are shooting the movie <i>Palmer</i>, in which Wainwright plays Timberlake’s lover.</p>
      <p>In the footage, the singer can be seen touching his co-star’s knee before holding her hand.</p>
      <p>An insider downplayed the interaction in an interview with <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/24/justin-timberlake-seen-holding-co-star-alisha-wainwrights-hand/">Page Six</a>, saying that it was “nothing.”</p>
      <p>“He was on an open balcony. They were among friends. It was nothing,” the source told <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/24/justin-timberlake-seen-holding-co-star-alisha-wainwrights-hand/">Page Six</a>.</p>
      <p>“There is 100 percent nothing going on,” a Timberlake source said.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile other sources told The Sun that Timberlake “appeared to have been drinking heavily and was unsteady on his feet.”</p>
      <p>One onlooker told the publication, “[Timberlake and Wainwright] were smiling and laughing. At one stage, he grabbed her hand and rested it on his knee. She then gently started stroking his leg. Then he clutched her hand with both of his and was playing with her hands.”</p>
