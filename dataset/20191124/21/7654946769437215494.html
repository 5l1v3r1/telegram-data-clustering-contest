      <p>President Trump on Sunday retweeted a Republican National Committee ad that uses the words of Democrats — including progressive lightning rod Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez — talking about impeachment against them.</p>
      <p>The freshman lawmaker, who has supported ousting Trump even before the recent rounds of public hearings as part of the House’s impeachment inquiry, leads the list of prominent Democrats on the 31-second ad.</p>
      <p>“This is about preventing a potentially disastrous outcome from occurring next year,” Ocasio-Cortez says in the video.</p>
      <p>Her comments came during an interview on CNN after the acting Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and deputy assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified on the first day of public hearings in the House on Nov. 13.</p>
      <p>The ad, <a href="https://twitter.com/RealSaavedra/status/1197305095970418688">titled “Democrats are Unhinged,”</a> also includes a who’s who of top Democratic leadership.</p>

      <p>Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which is spearheading the impeachment effort, was shown calling Trump “that charlatan in the White House.”</p>
      <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi referred to Trump as “an impostor.”</p>
      <p>“We cannot accept a second term for Donald Trump,” she said later in the video.</p>
      <p>It also included Rep. Rashida Tlaib telling a crowd of supporters after she was sworn-in to Congress in January 2017 that “we’re going to impeach the motherf—er.”</p>
