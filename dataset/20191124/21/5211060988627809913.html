      <p>TORONTO -- In Ticat territory, Hamilton football fans donned their team colours on Sunday—gearing up for what could be their team’s biggest victory in two decades.</p>
      <p>The Tiger-Cats are the favourite to win the 107th Grey Cup, set to kick off Sunday night in Calgary, and long-time fans like Albert and Carolyn Snow say they hope they won’t be disappointed.</p>
      <p>“It scares me a little,” Albert Snow said. “They did so well this year, but when it comes to the last game, anything could happen.”</p>
      <p>“We’re always supportive,” Carolyn Snow said. “I think Hamilton is a city of great football fans.”</p>

      <p>The city will come together to watch their team face the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.Winnipeg hasn’t won a championship in 29 years.</p>
      <p>But Hamilton had the best regular-season record, and West Town Bar &amp; Grill owner Joe Stanicak is hopeful the loyal fans who patronize his pub will finally see a pay-off tonight.</p>
      <p>“It’s good for the city and it’s good for us to have a professional team to be the best,” he said.</p>
      <p>Across the street at the Bitten on Locke bakery, owner Erica Savoy prepared 200 Tiger-Cat topped cupcakes for the big game.</p>
      <p>“Since the playoffs, we’ve been doing Ticat stuff like crazy,” she said. “As soon as we knew we were going to the Grey Cup, we kinda went nuts with it.”</p>

      <p>Season-tickets holder Allison Ward was in the bakery buying the Grey Cup treats for a football party.</p>
      <p>“Big football fan, big cupcake fan,” she laughed—hoping the game tonight will be just as sweet.</p>
      <p>The Grey Cup is set to begin around 6 p.m. on Sunday.</p>
