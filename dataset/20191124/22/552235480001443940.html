      <h1>Kristoffer Ajer in Celtic plea as he urges Neil Lennon to let big guns make European history</h1>
      <h2>The Norwegian insists none of the squad want to miss out on the clash against Rennes on Thursday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:29:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Craig Swan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/craig-swan/</a></address>
      <p>Determined <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kristoffer-ajer">Kristoffer Ajer</a> is adamant no one wants to miss out on Celtic’s chance to make European history.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> ’s men go into <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> battle against Rennes on Thursday night knowing victory could win them Group E.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> have already qualified for the knockout stages with two games to spare.</p>
      <p>With the weekend win over Livingston the first in a punishing run of 11 matches before the mid-winter shutdown, the manager has an option available to shuffle his pack and rest key men.</p>
      <p>However, Ajer insists none of the squad want to miss out on the clash against the French.</p>

      <p>Celtic can finish top of a group section for the first time in 18 years of Champions and Europa League competition if they win and Cluj lose to Lazio in Rome and the Norwegian said: “Everyone is fit and eager to play, especially when you are in that rhythm and everyone is enjoying playing the matches.</p>
      <p>“Thursday is a massive game. We want to win the group and we can do it if we take the three points against Rennes.</p>
      <p>“It’s important for us on both counts in the fact that we have ambitions to go far in Europe and if we win the group, we would meet a second placed team, but we also want to just keep winning and everyone wants to play.</p>
      <p>“You want to be part of it and keep the rhythm. That’s the most important part.</p>
      <p>“The staff behind the squad works so hard every single day to keep us fit. You see it in every single that we keep going until the end.”</p>
      <p>Lennon will have to make some alterations from the weekend win with right-back Jeremie Frimpong ineligible for the contest.</p>
      <p>Moritz Bauer could take the position with Hatem Abd Elhamed injured, while Jonny Hayes could also miss out after dislocating his shoulder during the 4-0 success over Gary Holt’s team.</p>
