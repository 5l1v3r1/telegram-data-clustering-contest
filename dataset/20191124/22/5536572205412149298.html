      <p>Fans behaving badly at sporting events happens every single year at every major or amateur sport, some worse than others.</p>
      <p>Case in point, a male Bruins fan possibly dropped some food on a female Boston Bruins fan during a recent game against the Minnesota Wild and things got freaking crazy.</p>
      <p>That female Bruins fan got out of her seat and scolded the man fan to wipe the substance off her jacket and noted to him that it gt in her hair as well. She also called the poor guy a ‘pussy’ and continued to yell at him to apologize to her and her boyfriend who never got out of his seat.</p>
