      <p>LIAN, Batangas — The eldest son of the late Lucio “Bong” C. Tan Jr. vowed that he will continue his father’s environmental advocacies, which the US-educated software engineer also wants to incorporate in the family’s entire business empire.</p>
      <p>“I have been made aware of the many projects of my father, but it is his initiatives that help address the climate crisis and promote environmental sustainability that make me truly proud,” said Lucio “Hun Hun” Tan III, 27.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, billionaire Lucio Tan’s grandson and namesake attended the Allianz PNB Life and Absolut Distillers partnership for the green canopy project, a reforestation initiative in commemoration of the legacy of his late father.</p>
      <p>“Rest assured, I intend to continue my father’s green advocacy and other efforts that promote sustainability,” the young Tan said in his speech, marking his first media appearance since returning from the US where he grew up with brother Kyle.</p>
      <p>Tan III, the newly minted President of Two Degrees, Inc., added “I believe in impact investing. I believe that environmental consciousness should be adopted in every level of the business in order to secure future stability.”</p>
      <p>“It’s the only way to go if we want a future for this planet,” he declared before his mother Julie, LT Group distilleries operations head Gerry Tee and Allianz PNP Life President and Chief Executive Officer Alexander Grenz.</p>
      <p>As president of Two Degrees, Tan III now leads his father’s Green Canopy project that aims to plant 12 million trees starting with the reforestation of the Sierra Madre Mountains in the Cagayan region.</p>
      <p>To date, the project has already planted 500,000 trees in the Sierra Madre Mountains covering parts of the 24,000-hectare land. Allianz PNP Life was the first among the companies within the LT Group to support the Green Canopy project.</p>
      <p>“Aside from reforestation, my father had also hoped to provide employment to the local communities,” he said, adding “I hope other companies within the LT Group will follow.”</p>
      <p>The tycoon’s grandson graduated summa cum laude from Stanford University with a double degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.</p>
      <p>Among other citations, the young Tan obtained the Frederick Emmons Terman Engineering Scholarship award, an annual citation given by Stanford’s School of Engineering to seniors for outstanding academic achievement.</p>
