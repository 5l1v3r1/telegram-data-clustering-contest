      <p>President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government failed to abide by the law when his cabinet last week announced name changes in cities and towns as that is the sole responsibility of each respective local authority according to the Urban Council’s Act, a law expert has said.</p>
      <p>Professor Lovemore Madhuku has accused President Mnangagwa’s government of flouting the law by having a street in each city and selected towns named after him.</p>
      <p>Several other roads and government buildings across the country were also renamed after local and regional icons.</p>
      <p>Professor Madhuku said Harare can sue government for the name changes.</p>
      <p>“City of Harare can take the government of Zimbabwe to court over the renaming of streets.</p>
      <p>“According to the Urban Councils Act Section 212 (1) passed in 2018 and signed by the Local government Minister, the naming of roads and streets within council areas remains the prerogative of local authorities.</p>
      <p>“The section reads: The council may from time to time assign names to roads within the council area and cause the name of any road to be affixed to or painted on any house, building or other structure fronting upon any part of such road.”</p>
      <p>Professor Madhuku said in this case it is up to the city councils to approach the courts to reverse this as the law is very clear.</p>
