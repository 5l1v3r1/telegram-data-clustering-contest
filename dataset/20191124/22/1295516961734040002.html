      <p><i>The Walking Dead</i>’s midseason finale starts by briefly telling the story of Dante. In flashback, we see Alpha give Dante his mission to infiltrate Alexandria; he's apparently chosen, at least in part, because Lydia doesn’t know him. He then gets the attention of the joint communities by acting like he’s under attack by walkers. After he's brought in and accepted, Dante sets out to quietly destroy Alexandria. He leaves secret notes for Alpha, graffities the community with “Silence the Whisperers,” sabotages the water pump, and suffocates Cheryl with a pillow. For his actions, Alpha promises him a special place with the Whisperers -- whatever that means.</p>

      <p>As Siddiq starts to resurrect behind Dante, Rosita notices Dante’s knife. Rosita puts Coco down. As Dante attacks her, walker Siddiq stumbles towards the crying baby. Dante tries to strangle Rosita, but luckily Rosita is a badass. She gets ahold of the knife and stabs him. She then runs to Siddiq, puts him down, runs back to Dante, subdues him and retrieves Coco.</p>
      <p>Later, Daryl, Gabriel, Carol and Rosita interrogate Dante. Dante is indifferent to the proceedings, finally revealing a bleak view of the world that sees people as fundamentally evil and attachments to others as useless. Still, Gabriel’s confused -- why kill Siddiq months after torturing him? Dante explains it wasn’t part of the plan. He liked Siddiq, but you gotta do, what you gotta do. Still, he’s looking forward to the Alexandrians coming to blows over what to do about him. He knows they’ll give him a public trial, since that’s what civilized people do.</p>

      <p>Later, Eugene and Ezekiel join the Alexandrians for Siddiq’s funeral. Carol and Ezekiel finally have a proper conversation, but Ezekiel still can’t admit his cancer diagnosis to Carol.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Rosita leaves the grounds to take her aggression out on some walkers outside Alexandria’s gates. Surprisingly, she gets into a bit of trouble and Eugene has to help her take out the final walker. They have an awkward conversation. Eugene offers his condolences and then leaves for Hilltop.</p>
      <p>Back at the house he shares with Rosita, Gabriel watches Dante’s video from when he first came to Alexandria. In it, he discusses the son he lost to walkers. Rosita comes home and confesses that for the first time she’s afraid to die. She doesn’t want Coco to be an orphan. But it’s making her sloppy, and it’s why she slipped up with the walkers at the gates. Gabriel isn’t worried. He believes it’s a temporary issue -- she’ll get over her fear. Rosita isn’t so sure.</p>

      <p>Gabriel goes to see the imprisoned Dante. He wants to know if Dante ever had a son. Dante won’t confirm or deny. Gabriel notes that the fact that he used to have a family was one of the things he liked about Dante. He opens the prison cell door and steps inside. Dante talks about the meaninglessness of trust and dismisses Gabriel’s faith in people.</p>
      <p>Gabriel confesses that his family will never be the same after what Dante did to Siddiq. And maybe Rosita will blame him for not protecting them enough. He then pulls out a knife and stabs Dante in the neck. Dante attempts to fight back, but Gabriel stabs Dante repeatedly until he’s more than dead.</p>
      <p>Rosita watches from her window as Gabriel leaves the prison. Later she joins him to watch Dante’s body burn.</p>
      <p>Gabriel’s certainly come a long way from the man who wouldn’t let his parishioners into his church when the zombie outbreak started. Gabriel may not have followed procedure in taking out Dante, but it’s a death the Alexandrians are unlikely to mourn.</p>
