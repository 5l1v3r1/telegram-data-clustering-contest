      <p>Celebrating <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/samajwadi-party/">Samajwadi Party</a> founder <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mulayam-singh-yadav">Mulayam Singh Yadav</a>’s 81st birthday, his brother Shivpal Yadav, president of SP’s breakaway Pragatisheel Party, had expected that his brother would join the event in Etawah, 200 km from Lucknow. But his expectations were belied as Mulayam gave a miss to his brother’s RSVP and instead celebrated the birthday with his son and SP president Akhilesh Yadav at the state party headquarters in Lucknow. Unperturbed, Shivpal, however, tweeted a picture of the cake cutting ceremony and wished for good health for his brother.</p>
      <h3>Name War</h3>
      <p>Continuing with his penchant with name change, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath recently announced that Vindhyavasini Park in his home district Gorakhpur will be named after Hanuman Prasad Poddar, a trustee of Geeta Press. However, he was left red-faced when <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> MLC Devendra Pratap Singh, in a letter, asked him to retain the old name. A freedom fighter, Vindhyavasini Prasad Verma played a key role in Champaran Satyagraha. Singh’s dissent was followed by Congress general secretary <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/priyanka-gandhi/">Priyanka Gandhi</a>’s stinging remarks that the “arrogant” state government was insulting the contribution of a freedom fighter.</p>
      <h3>Growing Dissent</h3>
      <p>Despite Congress cracking whip on veteran leaders for anti-party activities, dissent against the new leadership at the state Congress is refusing to dissipate. Sources within the party say that the task to make everyone fall in line will not be a cinch. Recently, party leaders raised slogans against one of the AICC secretaries during his visit to Barabanki for appointing a new district president, who was termed an “outsider”. Similar voices of resentment continue to come from different districts. Some leaders have also questioned “lenient” action taken against Rae Bareli MLA Aditi Singh. She has been served a notice for alleged indiscipline as she attended the Assembly session against the party whip. She has also praised development initiatives of the chief minister in her speech.</p>
