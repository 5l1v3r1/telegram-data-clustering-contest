      <h1>Are working parents falling “a bit short”? </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:50:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.mygc.com.au/author/meddler/" target="_blank">The Meddler</a></address>
      <p>Last week, Jamila Rizvi took issue with the way a working mum was depicted in the absolutely brilliant Brisbane-made children’s’ cartoon, Bluey.</p>
      <p>The description of the mum character, Chilli, was described as falling “a bit short” as a parent because she works, and isn’t “able to pull off” quite as much with her kids, when compared to other non-working mums.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/JamilaRizvi?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Jamila wrote</a> on Twitter: “This is so incredibly disappointing from writers I’ve come to worship… What a horrible write-up of a mum doing a damn fine job. PS. I know I am getting very worked up about a cartoon but honestly, before the age of 5 is where most of the neural pathways are formed for a child. This stuff matters enormously.”</p>
      <p>The scandal, though you can barely call it that, was over practically before it started, as show creator <a href="https://twitter.com/Daley_Pearson">Daley Pearson</a> immediately jumped in with a fix.</p>
      <p>“Thank you so much for the catching this, Jamila. We caught this last night and greatly appreciate you letting us know,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>“We love Chilli so much and we’re revising now. We wanted to address quickly and we updated last night for you and the Bluey family. Thank you, Thank you.”</p>
      <p>The whole situation, however, prompts me to reflect on what it means to be a working mother in this day and age.</p>
      <p>The expectations are exceptionally high – to the point where we really do anticipate that working parents can do and achieve every bit as much as non-working parents.</p>
      <p>And that’s just not realistic.</p>
      <p>If you’re working, that means you genuinely have less hours in the week to spend with your kids.</p>
      <p>I know this, because I’m a working parent. With my first child when I worked less, we spent most of our days at the park, at playgroup, at rhyme time, at swimming lessons, at baby music classes.</p>
      <p>These days, my three-year-old is winning if I manage to take him to the park once a fortnight. Being a working mum of three is busy and I just simply can’t achieve what would be possible if I didn’t work.</p>
      <p>Maybe the problem is not that we suggest parents “fall a bit short” when they don’t achieve everything in a day that non-working parents can.</p>
      <p>Maybe the problem is that we expect that they can.</p>
