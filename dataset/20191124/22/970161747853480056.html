        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tom-cruise/">Tom Cruise</a> might want to rethink the next time he jumps off a building for a stunt, as he’s ‘too old’ for action movies according to the author of Jack Reacher.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 57-year-old has become one of Hollywood’s most renowned daredevils and famously films most of his own stunts no matter how risky.</p>
      <p>That includes stunts like high-speed car chases for two Jack Reacher movies, in which he played a former military agent turned murder investigator.</p>
      <p>However, Lee Child, who penned the Jack Reacher novels, thinks Tom should hang up his stunt boots due to his age, and opt for slower-paced character-driven roles.</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/past-six-days/2019-11-23/the-times-magazine/lee-child-talks-jack-reacher-tom-cruise-and-new-book-the-hero-ff6p30rzp">interview with The Sunday Times</a>, Lee discussed his decision to quit the Jack Reacher movies at two installments and said: ‘Cruise was reluctant. He had his own investment in it, he was going to argue against it.</p>

      <p>‘It sounds extremely patronising but I think it’s good for him. He’s too old for this stuff. He’s 57, he needs to move on, transition to being a character actor.’</p>
      <p>Lee added: ‘He could get another 20 years out of it. He has the talent. He’s a terrific guy, very considerate, good fun.’</p>

      <p>It was a surprising choice to end the Jack Reacher franchise as they were blockbuster hits with the first grossing $218.3 million (£168 million) and the second taking home a healthy $162.1 million (£126 million) at the box office.</p>
      <p>While Tom is willing to go the extreme for his art, even he admits hanging off the side of a plane for Mission:Impossible 5 in 2015 was terrifying.</p>
      <p>The actor said at the time: ‘As always, I will do everything I can to entertain an audience and put as many people into your theaters.</p>
      <p>‘I was scared s**tless. I’m an aerobatic pilot and I’ve always wanted to do that.’</p>
      <p>There won’t be any slowing down just yet for Tom as he’s set to star in the long-awaited Top Gun sequel where he reprises his role as daredevil Maverick.</p>
