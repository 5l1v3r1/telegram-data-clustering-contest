      <p>Russian winter swimmers, also known as "walruses", took to the freezing waters of Lake Baikal to mark national Walrus Day.</p>
      <p>The athletes plunged into the 4-Celsius-degree (39 Fahrenheit) water of the lake, which rarely reaches more than 10 Celsius degrees (50 Fahrenheit), even in summer.</p>
      <p>Sergey Kushnaryov, a winter swimmer, said that it is "better to swim all year round" rather than to wait for the warmer season.</p>
      <p>Many "walruses" believe that winter swimming helps them to resist colds and improves their overall health.</p>
      <p>Ice water swimming, or "walrusing", is a common activity in colder countries, including Russia.</p>
