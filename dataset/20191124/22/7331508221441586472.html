      <h1>Jamal Adams: Jets felt disrespected by boos at home</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:50:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:50</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Cimini</a></address>
      <p>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- When the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets">New York Jets</a> came out for their pregame warmups on Sunday, they heard loud boos. In their own building, MetLife Stadium.</p>
      <p>It was filled with a large contingent of <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/oak/oakland-raiders">Oakland Raiders</a>' fans, who tried to make it like the Black Hole. The Jets took umbrage, especially outspoken safety <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115373/jamal-adams">Jamal Adams</a>, who addressed his teammates when they returned to the locker room before the opening kickoff.</p>
      <p>"I'm not going to lie to you, when we came on to the field, we felt disrespected," Adams said after the Jets' 34-3 victory. "We got booed in our own home stadium by the Oakland fans. We came back into this locker room. It was a hell of a talk. It was something that needed to be said."</p>
      <p>When pressed, Adams said: "I'm not going to get into what was said, but we felt disrespected. I came in here and sparked it up."</p>
      <p>It's not often a home team derives motivation from a negative reaction in its own stadium, but it worked for the Jets (4-7), who won their third straight and snapped the Raiders' three-game winning streak.</p>
      <p>"Put up or shut up," said Adams, describing his team's mentality. "I don't want to sound arrogant or cocky, but [the Oakland fans] came in a little too happy, let's put it like that. They thought it would be easy, put it like that."</p>
      <p>This was the Jets' third home game that had an away feel to it, as the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants">New York Giants</a> (obviously) drew many fans.</p>
      <p>The Jets' record in those games: 3-0.</p>
