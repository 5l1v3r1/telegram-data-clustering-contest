      <p>Speaking on her fame, during an interview with Australian entertainment show The Project, Kim compared her life to the Royals.</p>
      <p>She drew parallels between her own life and those of Prince Harry, 35, and 38-year-old Meghan.</p>
      <p>Kim told the publication: "I think everyone has their own journey and I think their journey is extremely personal with what his mother experienced and how her life was so affected by the spotlight and by paparazzi.</p>
      <p>"I don’t think anyone can know what that is like except for them."</p>

      <p>She continued: "I think, as I’m older and I have kids, and what I would want for them, is just the safest place.</p>
      <p>"I can definitely empathise with their need for having a secure safe place and taking time for themselves and having privacy when they need it."</p>
      <p>The business mogul then wanted to make it clear that she wasn't complaining about her very public life.</p>
      <p>She added: "I’m not one of those people that will complain and be like ‘I don’t have any privacy’ or 'my life is so different'."</p>

      <p>Kim continued to say her biggest issue with being famous and having a busy life is keeping up with pals.</p>
      <p>She said: "I think the hardest part is keeping up with my friends. I have the best friends I could ever have wished for and they’re all girls I grew up with.</p>
      <p>"But you do have to put in work to maintain those relationships."</p>
