      <p>Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis has reached a deal to buy cholesterol drugmaker The Medicines Co. for $9.7 billion.</p>
      <p>Novartis will pay $85 per share for the New Jersey biotech company, a sharp increase over The Medicine Co.'s Friday closing price of $68.55 per share. The deal is worth $9.7 billion, including outstanding stock options and convertible debt.</p>
      <p>The Medicines Co. is in late-stage studies of a drug, inclisiran, meant to lower cholesterol.</p>
      <p>Novartis has a pattern of acquiring other companies in recent years to expand its portfolio of drugs.</p>
      <p>"We're hoping to reimagine treatment of the leading global cause of death. This could be a strong step forward in Novartis' transformation into a focused medicines company," Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan tweeted Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Medicines Co. focuses on researching treatments for cardiovascular disease, specifically looking at ways to lower so-called bad cholesterol.</p>
      <p>The deal is expected to close early next year.</p>
