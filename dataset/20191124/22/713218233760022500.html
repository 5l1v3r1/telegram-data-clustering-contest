      <p>Windsong Travel has joined an elite group of Australian travel agencies.</p>
      <p>It was one of just 10 Australian travel retailers presented with a Gold Choice Award during a ceremony held in Adelaide this month.</p>
      <p>The event was attended by leaders of the Australian travel industry and members of Travellers Choice - a group of leading independently-owned travel agencies.</p>
      <p>To receive a Gold Choice Award, a travel company must rank among the top 10 performing travel agencies in the Australia-wide Travellers Choice network, which was this year named Best Agency Group at the National Travel Industry Awards.</p>
      <p>Travellers Choice Managing Director Christian Hunter said winning agencies demonstrated outstanding customer service, travel expertise and business acumen.</p>
      <p>"Windsong Travel is one of Australia's leading travel agencies because it combines exceptional travel knowledge and skills with an understanding of its local community and the unique needs of its clients," Mr Hunter said.</p>
      <p>James Cracknell, the owner of Windsong Travel, said the Gold Choice Award was a team effort.</p>
      <p>"Despite the worst drought ever we were still able to be up with the larger metro agencies which is especially satisfying. Every member of our agency is committed to using their professional expertise and personal experience to find the best travel solutions for our customers and we cannot thank our loyal customers enough for their incredible support of our small business."</p>
