      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:50:45+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The New England Patriots and the Dallas Cowboys are battling the elements at Gillette Stadium this evening. The AFC East and NFC East leaders are playing a cold, windy, rainy contest in Foxborough.</p>
      <p>So far, the Patriots have battled the elements better. New England is leading Dallas, 10-6, after two quarters of play.</p>
      <p>New England got on the board early thanks to a blocked Dallas punt. The Patriots found the end zone a couple of plays later. Tom Brady’s offense added a field goal on a later drive, taking a double-digit lead.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys battled back with a pair of field goals, though Jason Garrett’s team might regret a missed opportunity inside the red zone.</p>
      <p>New England had a chance to add points at the end of the half, but missed a field goal for the second time.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Football Power Index has updated its prediction for the game.</p>
      <h3>ESPN’s computer likes the New England Patriots to hold on in the second half, giving them a 78.6 percent chance of winning. It gives the Dallas Cowboys a 21.4 percent chance of coming back and winning.</h3>
      <p>The Cowboys and the Patriots will begin their second half soon.</p>
      <p>The game is on FOX.</p>
