      <p>Jacqueline Jossa’s family have urged viewers to stop putting her up for Bushtucker Trials – but despite her tears think the jungle experience could be “the making of her”.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline, 27, who admitted to being “terrified” about going on the show, has broken down several times after being picked for multiple trials, including a brilliant effort last night to win 12 stars with Ian Wright in the Crevice of Cruelty.</p>
      <p>Before that she was forced to take on spiders in Face Your Fears and was voted to look for stars in the Snake Hotel.</p>
      <p>And proud mum, Selina Jossa, 63, said: “It is a lot for her. I think she has proven herself so they could vote for someone else.</p>

      <p>“There are trials where they all take part and she is doing them as well as the other ones. She needs a little break.</p>
      <p>“The trouble is if you don’t get any stars they vote you to do them to annoy the camp-mates and if you do well then the viewers enjoy seeing you do them.</p>
      <p>“It is partly my fault because we have got a really big family in Ireland and I think they all keep voting for her because I told them to at the start.”</p>
      <p>Jacqueline, herself, said on last night’s show: “You worry, ‘Why are people voting me,’ there’s only so much you can do. I hope I don’t break.</p>
      <p>“I’ve just realised I really care about what other people think of me. I didn’t think I cared that much, but being in here I’ve realised how much I do.”</p>

      <p>And sister Katrina Farrelly, 36, said: “She has done a lot of trials and she needs a bit of a break.”</p>
      <p>Both Selina and Katrina are adamant Jacqueline, joint 4-1 favourite with Roman Kemp to win, will not quit despite also getting teary over missing her two girls, Mia and Ella.</p>
      <p>She now has a pillow with their photos on, but receiving it made her emotional.</p>
      <p>Selina said. “She wears her heart on her sleeve and lets her emotions out.</p>
      <p>“When she cried, that was my fault because I gave her the pillow. It will play on her mind what the kids are doing – she will know they are okay because we are looking after them, the family on both sides are pitching in.”</p>
      <p>Speaking on Friday, Jacqueline’s husband, ex-Towie star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dan-osborne-towie-fame-13054898">Dan Osborne</a> , insisted she would cope with the strain.</p>
      <p>He said: “It is horrible seeing Jac upset, but she will be fine.”</p>

      <p>Jacqueline’s mum and sister both agree whatever happens, the show will boost her confidence.</p>
      <p>And they are pleased the devoted mum has put herself first for once.</p>
      <p>And Selina said: “It could be the making of her. If she can get to the final week... to do the whole experience is what you would want.”</p>
      <p>Katrina added: “It will be really good for her confidence because you can see in there sometimes she doesn’t think she can do it, but she can. She is really strong, she just needs to believe in herself a bit more.”</p>
      <p>Katrina says the ex-EastEnders star is a determined individual, which helped her fulfil her dream of setting up a performing arts school.</p>
      <p>“She wanted to do that, and she has,” Katrina said.</p>
      <p>“And now it is the same with the jungle. When she really wants to do something she will do it.”</p>
      <p>As well as that strength of character, Katrina says her sister is modest too.</p>
      <p>And she is not surprised that Jacqueline has not stripped down to just a bikini to go in the jungle shower.</p>

      <p>“In day-to-day life she is not that image-focused and doesn’t wear make up during the day, only for photoshoots,” Katrina said.</p>
      <p>“I know some people want to do shower scenes to show off their bodies but Jacqueline is not like that.”</p>
      <p>The whole family were shocked when she told them she might sign up for the show earlier this year.</p>
      <p>A fear of spiders runs through the generations and she is not too keen on other creepy crawlies, either.</p>
      <p>Speaking from Jacqueline’s Performing Arts Academy, in Bexleyheath, South East London which she runs with her sister, Katrina joked: “She was terrible with insects when we were growing up – we were both scared of spiders and we get it from mum.</p>
      <p>“She used to leave pots around with spiders underneath because she couldn’t catch them so she would trap them and wait for dad to get home.”</p>
      <p>Now Jacqueline’s daughters, husband Dan, her mum, and dad John are preparing to fly to Australia this week.</p>

      <p>But they hope not to greet her until next month – after the final.</p>
      <p>Katrina added: “Before she went in she definitely wasn’t expecting to win.</p>
      <p>“I think she has proved she can do the challenges and is strong to get through them and to live in the jungle.</p>
      <p>“I think missing the family is going to be the main thing.”</p>
      <p>The reunion, when it comes, is sure to be emotional for Jacqueline who told the Mirror hours before entering the show: “I’m terrified. There’s not one thing to be scared about, is there?</p>
      <p>“You’re not with your family and friends, you’re in a different country.</p>
      <p>“You’re with people you’ve never met, doing things you’ve never done. I’m completely out of my comfort zone.”</p>
