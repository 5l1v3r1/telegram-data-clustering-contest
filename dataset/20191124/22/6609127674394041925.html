      <p>A fundraising page was set up by sister-in-law Kelly Taylor who told how she was hoping to help the West Lothian couple replace what they had lost.</p>
      <p>In a touching statement, she wrote: "My Brother in Law Daniel, his partner Sophie &amp; my baby Niece Ruby lost their home and all their belongings after their home went on fire on Saturday 23rd November.</p>
      <p>"They have literally lost everything. They have no clothes, no baby stuff or anything left at all.</p>
      <p>"I am fundraising to support them to rebuild and replace all their belongings.</p>
      <p>"We would appreciate any donations that you can spare to help. Thank you."</p>
      <p>Since being shared the page has already managed to exceed it's target of £1,000 - raising over £2,200 for the family ahead of Christmas.</p>
      <p>And today, the family thanked punters for their support.</p>
      <p>Kelly wrote: "We would like to thank everyone who has made a donation or turned up to offer clothes, furniture &amp; other things.</p>

      <p>"We don’t require any further offers for clothing, furniture etc as we have been overwhelmed with what we have been given so far.</p>
      <p>"Thank you everyone for your true generosity."</p>
      <p>People had flocked to the page after it was created this morning - with donations still rolling in for the couple.</p>
      <p>One person said: "So sad that this Family lost their home.. As we have a Baby Girl ourself I know how expensive things can be. So close to Christmas too. I wish this Family all the best and hope they can still enjoy Christmas with their beautiful Baby."</p>
      <p>While another added: "Terrible thing to happen, especially at this time of the year. Glad you’re all safe, hope your back on your feet soon."</p>
      <p>And one supporter wrote: "We went through the exact same in March. It is absolutely devastating but the main thing is you are all safe and I promise you will get through it."</p>
      <p>You can donate to the family's cause <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-family-after-devastating-fire">here</a>.</p>
      <p>We previously reported how the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4972390/jonathon-donaldson-chef-dead-fundraiser/">family of Scots chef Jonathon Donaldson</a> had launched a fundraiser in his honour.</p>
      <p>Thoughtful cousin Becca Graham, 16, has organised the GoFundMe page in a bid to raise much needed funds to support the family with funeral costs.</p>
