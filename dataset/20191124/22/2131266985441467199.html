      <p>Trains across Auckland were temporarily delayed or cancelled on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Just before 11am, Auckland Transport said a "network control matter" knocked the network offline.</p>
      <p>At 11:34am, the agency said "most" services had resumed.</p>
      <p>The outage followed cancellations and delays on the city's western line after <a href="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2019/11/trains-cancelled-after-truck-hits-bridge-in-auckland.html">a truck hit a rail overbridge in New Lynn.</a></p>
      <p>The bridge was later cleared by engineers, but traffic in both directions was backed up until the truck could be removed.</p>
