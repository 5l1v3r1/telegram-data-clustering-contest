      <p>On December 3, 31-year-old Vanitha Iyer, a resident of Navi Mumbai, will be given her second national award from the Minister of Social Justice — this one, for being the Best Employee with Hearing Impairment. Iyer, who was diagnosed with bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss since she was six months old, is a trained lip reader who can speak English.</p>
      <p>She is presently a Class 1 officer with New India Assurance, which nominated her for the award. “I just wanted to be as good as a normal person without needing to depend on anybody. I’d not expected these awards,” said Iyer.</p>
      <p>In 2013, Iyer was given the national award by then president <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/pranab-mukherjee">Pranab Mukherjee</a> for being a role model in the female category.</p>
      <p>Her father, N Balasubramanium, said, “She used to be teased by some in school, but she has never let that bring her down. She has tried to be better than her peers, and has achieved things any person would aspire to — she has studied engineering and is a Class 1 officer with the government.”</p>
      <p>At the age of eight, Iyer reportedly became the first child with a hearing impairment to earn a black belt in karate. She also dabbled in acting, baking and making artificial jewellery, among other things. She also received several scholarships.</p>
      <p>“Once we found out about her impairment, we shifted our family to Chennai so she could be enrolled in a special school… we made sure she did everything that her brother, older than her by a year, did. Her sense of equality and competitive spirit has worked in her favour,” said Balasubramanium.</p>
      <p>Iyer will join other recipients of the award for a sight-seeing programme and is getting ready to fly to Delhi with her father.</p>
