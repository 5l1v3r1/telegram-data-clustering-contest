      <p>Rescuers were struggling Sunday to save 14,600 sheep loaded on a cargo ship that capsized in the Black Sea off the coast of Romania, they said.</p>
      <p>The Queen Hind bound for Saudi Arabia overturned for yet unknown reasons shortly after leaving Romania's Midia port.</p>
      <p>The crew of 20 Syrians and one Lebanese were rescued, together with 32 sheep, two of which were pulled from the water, said Ana-Maria Stoica, a spokeswoman for the rescue services.</p>
      <p>"The rescue operation is ongoing... We hope that the sheep inside the ship's hold are still alive," she told AFP.</p>
      <p>Rescuers supported by the military, police and divers were trying to right the Palau-flagged ship and pull it to the port, she said.</p>
      <p>Romania's main livestock breeder and exporter association, Acebop, called for an urgent investigation.</p>

      <p>"Our association is shocked by the disaster," Acebop president Mary Pana said in a statement. "If we cannot protect livestock during long-distance transports, we should outright ban them."</p>
      <p>Gabriel Paun of NGO Animals International alleged that the ship had been overloaded. He added that the Queen Hind had already had engine problems last December.</p>
      <p>"An investigation must be opened without delay," he told AFP.</p>
      <p>Romania, which joined the EU in 2007, is one of its poorest members.</p>
      <p>It is the bloc's third-largest sheep breeder, after Britain and Spain, and a top exporter, primarily to Middle Eastern markets.</p>
      <p>Activists have labelled the livestock transport vessels -- about 100 of which leave Midia every year -- "death ships", saying sheep risk being cooked alive on board during the hot summer months.</p>
      <p>In July, Vytenis Andriukaitis, then European commissioner in charge of health and food safety, demanded that Bucharest stop the transport of 70,000 sheep to the Gulf, citing animal welfare.</p>
      <p>He has asked the European Commission to investigate Romania's practices.</p>
