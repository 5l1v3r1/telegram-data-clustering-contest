      <p>The dreaded Central Intelligence Organisation(CIO) on Friday detained a MSU graduating students union leader aligned to the MDC Alliance party under unclear circumstances.</p>
      <p>Sources at the institution said Mnangagwa’s CIOs detained MSU’s Zinasu Secretary General during the ongoing graduation ceremony at the Midlands State University in Gweru main campus amid fears that he would humiliate the country leader who is battling legitimacy and economic crisis.</p>
      <p>In a statement Zimbabwe Youth Movement said: “One of the graduating students who is also the Secretary General of Zinasu only identified as Pfunye was harassed and detained by the security agents amid fears that he would embarrass the so called President.</p>
      <blockquote>“Pfunye has played a great role within the student politics as he stood for students since the Mugabe regime and also spoke against all evil doing of the government.<br/><br/>“Today was suppose to be a day in which he celebrates his success but that has been denied by the Mnangagwa regime.<br/><br/>“In Solidarity with the student fraternity Zimbabwe Youth Movement condemns the move.”</blockquote>
