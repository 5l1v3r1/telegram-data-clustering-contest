      <p>For Pep Guardiola, winning would seem to be everything.</p>
      <p>Twenty-six trophies in a decade as a manager, including two Premier League titles and two Champions League triumphs, is testimony to that.</p>
      <p>But with his <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> side facing the prospect of relinquishing their title to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , Guardiola claimed coming out on top is not all that matters.</p>
      <p>City still trail the leaders by nine points, despite this gutsy win, with Jurgen Klopp’s side showing no signs of let-up in their pursuit of a first title for 30 years.</p>
      <p>But even if City fail to make it three straight title wins this season, they should not be deemed failures for coming up short, according to Guardiola.</p>

      <p>“I know here there are winners and losers - and that’s all,” said the Catalan.</p>
      <p>“But I think for the sport, for a message for society, it’s not good for our kids, our teenagers, to show them that just the winner is perfect.</p>
      <p>“We’re creating a depressed people, losing people and it’s not good. The most important thing is effort, commitment.</p>
      <p>“In football, I know we want to win, but there’s just one winner and the other is a disaster. It’s not right.</p>
      <p>“That’s why I said to the players, relax, do our job and we’ll see what happens in January, February and March. If we’re far away, OK, we’ll try again next season.</p>

      <p>“After we won the last two Premier Leagues, it looks like we have to win seven in a row and get 200 points every season. It doesn’t work that way at the high, high level.</p>
      <p>“Tennis players lose games, in golf Tommy Fleetwood doesn’t always win the tournament, even though I’d like that. If we lose, we lose.</p>
      <p>“But I promise you, when I see my team don’t fight, with no spirit, a lack of intensity and desire, I’m going to say, ‘I don’t like my team, I don’t like the way they play’. In these three-and-a-half years, people can say we play good or bad, but never that we give up, no.</p>
      <p>“Maybe we’re going to lose the title, but this team never gives up. That’s why we won today against an incredible, top side.”</p>
      <p>City had to dig deep to beat Frank Lampard’s enterprising young side, who dominated possession, a rarity against Guardiola’s ball-loving teams.</p>

      <p>Indeed, City’s overall possession of 46.74 per cent was the lowest recorded by a Guardiola side in any of his 381 top-flight matches at City, Bayern Munich and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> .</p>
      <p>Victory came at a cost for City, who lost record goal-scorer Sergio Aguero to a muscular injury which Guardiola claimed “looks bad”, while David Silva and Rodri were also forced off after feeling discomfort.</p>
      <p>In a season blighted by injuries, with City still missing Leroy Sane, Aymeric Laporte and Oleksandr Zinchenko, they can ill-afford further enforced losses to a squad already stretched to the limit.</p>
      <p>N’Golo Kante gave <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> the lead after 21 minutes, before Kevin De Bruyne levelled with a deflected shot.</p>
      <p>Riyad Mahrez decided the game before half-time with a goal of individual brilliance, as Guardiola’s men – denied a late third from Raheem Sterling when VAR ruled him offside – held on to remind Liverpool they are not about to go away quietly.</p>
