      <p>Our politicians have converged on Canberra for the final sitting fortnight of the year, and there is plenty on the agenda.</p>
      <p>But one subject is dominating all others today – the <a href="https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/alleged-plot-to-infiltrate-australian-government/news-story/a3cdbfb2830273e340ee22f9c4bea6b6">extraordinary allegation</a> that China tried to infiltrate parliament with a spy.</p>

      <h3>'No apology' for robodebt</h3>

      <p>We have one last exchange to highlight from Question Time. This one was about the government's robodebt system.</p>
      <p>"Given the government has now suspended robodebt after three years of operation, is it because the government, at the time of creating it, either didn't seek legal advice, had inaccurate legal advice, or received legal advice, but just didn't think that Australians would notice the government unjustly enriching itself at the expense of the most vulnerable in Australian society?" Bill Shorten asked.</p>
      <p>"Let me say very categorically, this government does not apologise for its efforts to protect the integrity of the welfare system," the relevant minister, Stuart Robert, replied.</p>
      <p>He said "refinements" had been made to the program, most recently to require more proof points before debt notices are issued.</p>
      <p>"No one gets a leave pass. No one at all. We have an absolute legal responsibility to collect debts owed to the Commonwealth."</p>
      <p>Not taking much of a backward step there.</p>
      <p>Mr Robert also mistakenly referred to Mr Shorten as the leader of the opposition, before promptly correcting himself. Brutal.</p>

      <h3>'An outright lie': Parliament erupts</h3>

      <p>There was another explosion of furious noise when Greens MP Adam Bandt used his question to link the government's climate change policies to the bushfires.</p>
      <p>"Prime Minister, if exporting pollution was an Olympic sport, you'd be on the podium with a medal around your neck," Mr Bandt said.</p>
      <p>"We're not some 1.3 per cent minnow, we're the world's third-largest exporter of climate pollution. Will you apologise for misleading the public by saying nothing we could do would make a difference to the climate crisis and catastrophic bushfires, given you are failing in the government's first duty, which is to protect its people?</p>
      <p>"Will you have the courage to apologise to the victims of the bushfires for exporting record amounts of thermal coal?"</p>
      <p>Nationals Leader Michael McCormack had the most violent eruption in response.</p>
      <p>"When are you going to apologise?" he absolutely bellowed, earning a rebuke from the Speaker.</p>
      <p>This has become an increasingly common feature of Question Time this year – the normally mild-mannered Deputy Prime Minister temporarily morphing into his much angrier alter-ego, Big Mac, and shouting at people.</p>
      <p>Personally, I think it adds a welcome element of spice to proceedings.</p>
      <p>Scott Morrison started his answer with a slightly more measured tone, repeating his usual line that the government will meet its emissions reduction targets.</p>
      <p>"What we won't do is engage in the reckless targets supported by the Greens and the Labor Party under this false promise, and I think dishonest promise that the member has been spruiking, both in this place and outside this place, and that is to suggest that there is some trade-off.</p>
      <p>"That if the government had adopted economy-wrecking emission reduction cuts that were put forward by Labor at the last election, then these fires would not have taken place.</p>
      <p>"That is an outright lie. It is an untruth and it is misleading those going through some of the most difficult times in their lives, and they have misled them grievously."</p>

      <h3>'For goodness' sake': Union blow-up</h3>

      <p>So, after 35 extraordinarily polite minutes, Question Time started, along with all the usual rancor.</p>
      <p>"Last week it was reported that an organisation had broken money laundering laws 23 million times. Was it a union or a bank?" Anthony Albanese asked.</p>
      <p>The "organisation" he was referring to is Westpac. You can read all about it <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/banking/day-of-reckoning-finally-arrives-for-australias-major-banks/news-story/784417ca80ef96ee95d45e0ebfaa8e36">here</a>.</p>
      <p>And the broader context is that the government is pushing to pass laws cracking down on unions and union officials this week. Labor argues the unions are being targeted under a double standard.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>RELATED: </b>
          <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/banking/day-of-reckoning-finally-arrives-for-australias-major-banks/news-story/784417ca80ef96ee95d45e0ebfaa8e36">Westpac accused of 23 million breaches</a>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>"It was a bank," Scott Morrison said, to predictable roars from the Labor MPs sitting across the chamber.</p>
      <p>"That's why, when I was treasurer, I introduced what is known as the Banking Executive Accountability Regime."</p>
      <p>He said Labor had tried to block that regime from being passed before eventually relenting – and that the penalties it established are more severe than those union officials are facing under the current legislation before parliament.</p>
      <p>"I think banks should take account of their manifest failures, and I think union thugs should also," Mr Morrison said.</p>
      <p>Labor went back to the issue about 10 minutes later.</p>
      <p>"Why does the Prime Minister say the leadership of a bank is up to the board after it has broken the 23 million times, when at the same time he wants to shut down entire unions for minor paperwork breaches?" asked Ged Kearney, who was president of the ACTU before she entered parliament.</p>
      <p>The howl from the government benches in response to that was so loud that Speaker Tony Smith made Ms Kearney start the question again, saying he didn't hear it.</p>
      <p>"Why does the Prime Minister have one rule for banks and another for working people?" she finally finished.</p>
      <p>"The next time some union thug breaks someone's arm, at the emergency clinic, we'll say it's just a paper cut, because it's a paperwork breach. For goodness' sake," Mr Morrison shot back.</p>
      <p>"The Labor Party are looking for any excuses to walk away from what they know is the right thing to do, to ensure that militant unionism has no place in this country.</p>
      <p>"They will not apply the same penalties to those in the corporate sector to the union sector? They won't do it, because all of them are here because of the unions. They are beholden to this union movement, and they are here to do their bidding."</p>
      <p>The buzz of angry noise stayed pretty constant throughout the whole answer.</p>

      <p>Question Time was delayed today by a few pieces of more solemn business, including tributes for the late Labor MP Ben Humphreys, who died on November 17, and an update on the bushfires.</p>
      <p>"I want to acknowledge the tremendous national effort taking place, with firefighters travelling from every state," Scott Morrison said.</p>
      <p>He hailed the co-operation between the state and federal governments, along with their preparation for the fires ahead of time.</p>
      <p>"The work undertaken across Australia in recent weeks has been the result of painstaking preparation. I shudder to think at what might have occurred if we had not prepared accordingly.</p>
      <p>"In a continent as big as ours, it is not a matter of if a natural disaster hits but when."</p>
      <p>And he reserved particularly fulsome praise for the Australian people.</p>
      <p>"I am in awe of our countrymen and women, who have all stepped up in this time, as they always do," said the Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>"We've seen our nation's best at their best."</p>
      <p>Finally, he alluded to the climate change debate that has erupted in recent weeks amid the fires.</p>
      <p>"I know more broadly, there are debates about other issues, and they rightly have a place for debate in this country. They're important issues, but our focus is and will continue to be to those directly affected."</p>
      <p>Labor Leader Anthony Albanese delivered a similar speech, though he did address the climate change issue in a bit more length.</p>
      <p>"As the fires rage on, we try to soften the blow by telling ourselves what we always do – that this is Australia. A price we pay for living on such a beautiful but harsh continent," said Mr Albanese.</p>
      <p>"We know that there have always been natural disasters in this nation. But we know also that this isn't just fire as usual. Because experts are lining up to tell us that climate change does mean longer and more intense fire seasons.</p>
      <p>"We are seeing places that should be strangers to flame incinerated before our eyes.</p>
      <p>"We know that the immediate priority is of course protecting life and protecting property. And we also know that we are so grateful to the emergency service personnel and volunteers. But the fire season is starting earlier and finishing later."</p>
      <p>Mr Albanese revealed he had written to Mr Morrison and suggested a meeting of COAG to examine various disaster preparedness measures.</p>
      <p>"We don't have the luxury of time, and we should consider these issues. Not in a way that creates rancor, as some of the unfortunate debate has in recent weeks," he said.</p>
      <p>"It needs to be considered in a sober way, a way that considers the way forward, based upon the facts and based upon the scientific advice that we're receiving."</p>

      <p>Sam Clench</p>
      <p>One last thing from that press conference with the Prime Minister – Mr Morrison briefly discussed his phone call with Donald Trump this morning.</p>
      <p>"I don't go into my private conversations with the President," Mr Morrison said, before promptly proceeding to kind of, sort of go into his private conversation with the President.</p>
      <p>"It was a great opportunity to say thank you to the President for the amazing work done to get Tim Weeks out and to get him on his way home," he said.</p>
      <p>"He was interested to know how we were going in relation to the terrible bushfires in Australia. He was very aware of that, and had been very impressed by the firefighting efforts of Australians, and I thanked him for the participation of our friends from the United States.</p>
      <p>"We talked broadly about strategic issues in the region, like we always do, because we both have a keen interest in those."</p>
      <p>Pressed to elaborate in more detail, Mr Morrison refused.</p>
      <p>"I think I've answered the question in the way I was happy to do," he said.</p>
      <aside><a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/australian-politics-live-monday-november-25/live-coverage/1d08328f3ca4dcd322fcf4205f13787a#27806">1:20 pm November 25, 2019 </a>Highlight</aside>
      <h3>Morrison addresses China story</h3>

      <p>Having spoken at length about those aged care measures, Mr Morrison then faced questions about China's alleged <a href="https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/alleged-plot-to-infiltrate-australian-government/news-story/a3cdbfb2830273e340ee22f9c4bea6b6">plot to install a spy</a> in Australia's parliament.</p>
      <p>"Are you surprised at how aggressive the Chinese Communist Party has been in its attempts to interfere in our democracy?" one reporter asked.</p>
      <p>"I will make a more general comment. I mean, a range of allegations have been made. The Director-General of ASIO has issued a statement, which says that these matters were already under examination and that will continue," Mr Morrison said.</p>
      <p>"I'm not going to draw any conclusions about that one way or the other, as is appropriate. What I can say is Australia is not naive to the threats that it faces more broadly.</p>
      <p>"That's why we strengthened the alws, why we increased the resources, that's why we established the Department of Home Affairs, to bring together all of this in a single portfolio, to ensure Australia is in the best possible position to deal with any threats.</p>
      <p>"I can assure Australians our government will never be lacking on the watch when it comes to protecting Australia's legitimate interests in this area."</p>
      <p>Another reporter asked him to comment more specifically on the explosive report about China.</p>
      <p>"I find the allegations deeply disturbing and troubling," the Prime Minister said.</p>
      <p>"These matters were already under investigation, and those investigations are continuing. I would caution anyone leaping to any conclusions about these matters – and that's why we have these agencies. I'm not. But I do find the allegations troubling and disturbing."</p>
      <p>He was also asked whether Australia could guarantee the safety of Wang Liqiang, a self-proclaimed Chinese spy who is now seeking asylum here.</p>
      <p>"He's in Australia. We have the rule of law in Australia. And as a result you can expect the same protections to apply to anyone who is living in our country, whether on a visa or any other arrangement," said Mr Morrison.</p>
      <p>"I can assure Australians that under our government, the resources have never been stronger, the laws have never been tougher, and the government has never been more determined to keep Australia free and safe from foreign interference."</p>

      <p>"One of my first acts as PM was to call a Royal Commission into the aged care sector, and also to look specifically at the issues of young Australians who find themselves in aged care facilities around the country," Mr Morrison said.</p>
      <p>"I said at the time that I believed it would be a very uncomfortable exercise for all Australians.</p>
      <p>"We were shocked and disturbed at the treatment of our older Australians in their moments of greatest vulnerability."</p>
      <p>He said it was important the government provide an "immediate" response. The details of that response are in the post below.</p>
      <p>"I want to stress that what we really need to establish, above and beyond everything else, is a culture of respect for older Australians," said the Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>"There will be further responses in respect to the final recommendations of the Royal Commission, or other matters as they arise.</p>
      <p>"I want to assure all Australians that we will deal with these issues as you would if you were standing in my shoes today.</p>
      <p>"I know quite precisely the sorts of things that you are thinking about at the moment, when it comes to the treatment of your loved ones in aged care. My family is no different to yours in that respect.</p>
      <p>"And I just want you to be assured that they're going to get care. I want that as much for your family as I want it for mine."</p>
      <p>The Royal Commission's final report is due in November of next year, so it's still a fair way off.</p>

      <p>These are the key points:</p>
      <p>+ <b><b>$496.3 million</b></b> for an additional 10,000 home care packages;</p>
      <p>+ <b><b>$25.5 million</b></b> to improve medication management programs to reduce the use of medication as a chemical restraint on aged care residents and at home;</p>
      <p>+ New restrictions and education for prescribers on the use of medication as a chemical restraint;</p>
      <p>+ <b><b>$10 million</b></b> for additional dementia training and support for aged care workers and providers;</p>
      <p>+ <b><b>$4.7 million</b></b> to help meet new targets to remove younger people with disabilities from residential aged care.</p>
      <p>The Royal Commission's final report is due on November 12 of next year. The government is promising to "continue rigorous oversight" of the sector in the meantime.</p>
      <p>Mr Morrison will speak about this at more length in a few moments, and no doubt face questions on other subjects, such as China. So stay tuned.</p>

      <h3>Labor goes after Taylor again</h3>

      <p>Sam Clench</p>
      <p>Labor has attempted to suspend standing orders in the House to once again go after its favourite punching bag, Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor.</p>
      <p>At issue here is <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/bizarrely-altered-document-sparks-scandal-for-the-government/news-story/b122ede1cf3743cf0279f4aa52be2a15">a letter Mr Taylor sent</a> to Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore in September, suggesting she should cut down on her council's carbon emissions by travelling less.</p>
      <p>“You might be interested to know that there are many practical ways local councils can take real and meaningful action to reduce their carbon emissions. One such example is to limit unnecessary air travel,” Mr Taylor wrote.</p>
      <p>“Given your most recent annual report shows your council spent $1.7 million on international travel, and $14.2 million on domestic travel, there is a real opportunity for your council to make a meaningful contribution to reducing Australia’s emissions.”</p>
      <p>The letter was a direct response to Ms Moore, who had previously written to the government, urging it to treat climate change as a “national emergency” and drive down emissions.</p>
      <p>The thing is, Mr Taylor's figures were wrong. Far from spending the staggering total of $15.9 million on travel in 2017-18, the council actually spent less than $300,000.</p>
      <p>The full annual report Mr Taylor cited as his office's source for the figure <a href="https://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/council/publications-updates/annual-report">is available online</a>, and shows the correct numbers.</p>
      <p>Labor thinks someone in Mr Taylor's office altered the document.</p>

      <p>Anyway, back to today's events. In October, Mr Taylor told the House the document he used "was drawn directly from the City of Sydney's website". Labor now argues that statement misled parliament. Hence the motion to suspend standing orders.</p>
      <p>"There are very few standards these days that ministers actually get held to, and the last one is the minister does not mislead the House," Manager of Opposition Business Tony Burke said.</p>
      <p>Mr Burke described it as the "most clear cut example" of misleading parliament he had ever seen.</p>
      <p>Of course, the attempt to suspend standing orders was always doomed to fail, because the government has the numbers in the House. But hey, it wouldn't be the first day of a sitting fortnight without some depressingly pointless political shenanigans.</p>
