      <p>Former member <b>Lee Eun Sung</b> (19) from <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/the-east-light">The East Light</a> will enlist in the military today.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, the young artist originally from the now-disbanded group recently wrote on Instagram containing the announcement. In a hand-written letter, he expressed:</p>
      <p>"<i>This is a decision that I have made and I've finished processing it internally, but the sadness that I feel owes to the fact that I won't be able to see you all for a while. It could appear that my enlisting all of a sudden is a bit strange, but I've been thinking a lot about my future for a long time. I made this decision because, this way, I would be able to spend more time with you afterwards.</i>"</p>

      <p>Back in 2018, Lee Eun Sung <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/06/former-the-east-light-member-lee-eun-sung-states-that-he-never-witnessed-any-signs-of-abuse-during-his-witness-testimony">denied seeing signs of abuse during his witness testimony</a> regarding the allegations against The East Light's former CEO. This year in July, the former CEO was sentenced for habitual child abuse and made another appeal in court. </p>
