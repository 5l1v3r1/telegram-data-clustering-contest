      <h1>Michael Smith makes staggering Hearts admission as he demands flops 'pull the finger out'</h1>
      <h2>The Jambos were battered 3-0 by Kilmarnock at Rugby Park on Saturday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:29:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Gannon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/michael-gannon/</a></address>
      <p>Hearts are in the market for a new manager and director of sport but perhaps they should also stick a shrink on the wishlist.</p>
      <p>The Jambos were clobbered by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> on Saturday to plunge back in to the relegation danger zone.</p>
      <p>And right-back Michael Smith admitted the first task for whoever gets the gig as boss will be to deal with the mental fragility around Gorgie.</p>
      <p>It’s going to take a heck of a lot of work as Hearts are all over the place.</p>
      <p>Smith admitted it wasn’t even a lack of confidence that caused their complete collapse at Rugby Park – if anything it was over confidence.</p>
      <p>Try getting your head around that one for a second.</p>
      <p>A team that’s won just six league games in the whole of 2019 walked out at the home of last term’s third best side and thought they’d stroll it.</p>
      <p>Frightening.</p>
      <p>Smith is an honest pro and can see the problems around him – but it was still quite the admission in the wake of a complete doing by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/angelo-alessio">Angelo Alessio</a>’s men.</p>

      <p>The Northern Ireland cap star said: “I think maybe it was a mentality problem.</p>
      <p>“We shouldn’t lack confidence as we did well against St Mirren. We should have been on a high.</p>
      <p>“Maybe we thought it would be easier than it was.</p>
      <p>“It has always been tough when I’ve been here before.</p>
      <p>“It was always going to be a tough day but it was really poor for us.</p>
      <p>“We are only one loss away from being at the bottom again.</p>
      <p>“We need to pull our finger out and everyone must realise we are in a scrap at the bottom.</p>
      <p>“We have got the quality to get out of it but it is a mentality problem again.”</p>
      <p>Stand-in boss Austin MacPhee put the defeat down to a crazy eight-minute spell.</p>
      <p>But that was only part of the picture – the Jambos were woeful throughout the 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>Veteran Killie winger Chris Burke plundered a stunning double and also teed up Eamonn Brophy in between to fire the Ayrshire outfit three up inside 16 minutes which allowed them to spark the cigars.</p>

      <p>Dugout hopeful MacPhee’s hopes of landing the job full-time took a serious hit as his Jambos were dismal, disorganised and, by the end, completely dispirited. Smith, though, insisted it is the players who should carry the can.</p>
      <p>He said: “Every loss is down to the players.</p>
      <p>“It is solely on us. We were very poor right from the off.</p>
      <p>“I could sense we were just not at the races.”</p>
      <p>Smith has been one of the few impressive players at Tynecastle this season and has a more level head than most.</p>
      <p>But he admitted the uncertainty at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> isn’t doing anyone any favours.</p>
      <p>Chief <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge</a> is determined to take her time to make the right appointments – but the club is stuck in limbo and could do with a new manager to come in and light a fire under the place.</p>
      <p>Smith said: “Does it have an affect? Yes and no.</p>
      <p>“Ann Budge has made a decision to take her time and it is a big decision.</p>

      <p>“I support that and whatever she decides in the end we will be fully behind.</p>
      <p>“When a manager gets sacked there is always a bit of chaos around the club.</p>
      <p>“The new manager might not like you so you have to make sure you do your best because whoever comes in will be watching us and keeping an eye on us.”</p>
      <p>The Hearts players will be hoping any new gaffer wasn’t tuning in here.</p>
      <p>Killie were as devastating as Hearts were desperate.</p>
      <p>The Jambos walked on to a three-punch combo that KO king Deontay Wilder would have been proud to land.</p>
      <p>Burke was the man doing the swinging.</p>

      <p>He blasted Killie ahead from a tight angle in the ninth minute after Mo El Makrini was given time and space to pick a pass. Five minutes later, the former Rangers ace curled in a cracking cross for Brophy to nod home before racing from the half-way line following a Hearts corner to complete a sensational solo second goal for Killie’s third.</p>
      <p>The Jambos would have been as well getting back on the bus there and then as they offered next to nothing in response apart from a five-minute flurry after half-time that fizzled out to nothing.</p>
      <p>Smith said: “To say the start killed us is an under-statement. It was a crazy eight minutes.</p>
      <p>“In the first 15 minutes we were wide open and made some stupid decisions. That was the game dead and buried there. They sat in and made it hard for us to break down.”</p>
      <p>It has been a rollercoaster spell for Smith, with a wonder goal opener in midweek against Germany before Northern Ireland got walloped 6-1.</p>
      <p>He said: “I had a fantastic seven minutes! After that it was a bit of a disaster.</p>
      <p>“It has been a crazy week but when I got back from international duty my head was very much on Hearts.</p>
      <p>“For whatever reason it didn’t happen and now it is back to the drawing board for Rangers next week.”</p>
