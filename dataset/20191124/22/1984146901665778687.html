      <h1>Steve Bruce explains why Villa job was harder than his Newcastle role, and that cabbage</h1>
      <h2>Newcastle head coach Steve Bruce has been speaking about managing Monday's opponents Aston Villa</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew Musgrove</a></address>
      <p>Since arriving at St James' Park in August, Steve Bruce has faced some harsh criticism but he maintains managing tomorrow's opponents was tougher.</p>
      <p>Over the last four months, Bruce has faced questions over his tactics and style of play with heavy defeats inflicted by Norwich City and Leicester City - yet Bruce reckons that the role he found himself in at Aston Villa tops United in terms of difficulty.</p>
      <p>Having taken the job at Villa Park in October 2017 with Villa 20th in the Championship, and without a win in 11 games, Bruce guided them to mid-table before a play-off final the year later.</p>
      <p>It was quite the achievement for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Bruce</a>, especially given that Aston Villa were struggling financially.</p>

      <p>"It was arguably my most difficult job, even more difficult than this," <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Bruce</a> said.</p>
      <p>"I got criticised, yes, but for that 18 months only Man City scored more goals than us.</p>
      <p>"It was always brought up as my style of play.</p>
      <p>"They are a very difficult lot. Great club, great support with great history, but it was in a mess."</p>
      <p>A play-off final against the backdrop of ever tightening purse strings wasn't enough, and with just two defeats in their opening 11 games to the 2018-19 season, Bruce was sacked.</p>
      <p>The fan discontent had peaked with a cabbage being thrown at the feet of Bruce.</p>

      <p>"It summed up that day against Preston, cruising 2-0 up at half-time, James Chester got sent off and then 3-2 down with two minutes to we equalised.. we then had a penalty, the ball fell to Glenn Whelan, he thought being the most experienced man on the pitch he should take it.</p>
      <p>"He had never scored a penalty in his life, I said give it to Bolasie because he had scored twice. He wanted to take the responsibility.</p>
      <p>“I thought it (cabbage) was a ball to begin with, it was a big old thing.</p>
      <p>"How he got it into the stadium I don’t know. Stephen Clemence miscontrolled it when came in, my reaction was ‘what the f*** is that?’ It didn’t miss me by much, it fell at my feet. I thought it was a ball, the size of it.</p>
      <p>"The fans can throw some things, but a cabbage?</p>
      <p>“I went the next day so I didn’t have time to get angry. It was one of the most unsavoury times of my career.”</p>
      <p>United head down to Villa in good form - and are looking to secure a third win on the bounce.</p>
      <p>Magpie fans have sold out their allocation, and Bruce wants to secure all three points.</p>
      <p>"Overall, I can look back on it and say I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
      <p>"It's a great club with big tradition big history but I want to go back and beat them. It's simple as that!"</p>
