      <p>The public hearings on proposed National Health Insurance (NHI) move to Glencoe in KwaZulu-Natal on Monday after a successful day in Umzimkhulu on Sunday. </p>
      <p>Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Health said residents filled the Clydesdale Community Hall to have their say on the proposals for universal access to health care. </p>
      <p>Committee chairperson, Sibongiseni Dhlomo, thanked the public for coming out in big numbers. </p>
      <p>"We are here to listen to you. Parliament sent us to get your views," said Dhlomo. </p>
      <p>"The NHI proposes universal access to healthcare services, irrespective of your financial status. The NHI is clear, even if you don't have money you will be receiving medical care."</p>
      <p>The committee felt that although there was support for NHI, residents also said they first wanted improvements to the current health care system.</p>
      <p>"This, according to them, means more hospitals should be built as the area currently has only one hospital." </p>
      <p>As with other hearings, residents took the opportunity to complain, saying there were not enough hospitals and doctors, and repeated medication shortages. </p>
      <p>Several people also stated that if asylum seekers or foreign nationals used the health services, they should also contribute to the fund. </p>
      <p>Written submissions on the NHI Bill will be accepted until November 29, 2019. They can be sent to: Ms Vuyokazi Majalamba, Portfolio Committee on Health, 3rd floor, 90 Plein Street, Cape Town 8000; e-mailed to vmajalamba@parliament.gov.za; or faxed to 086 694 3279 by the closing date.<br/><br/>Those who make submissions should also indicate whether they would like to do a verbal presentation.</p>
      <p>The hearings in the Endumeni Local Municipality area start at 14:30 in Glencoe Town Hall until 19:30.</p>
