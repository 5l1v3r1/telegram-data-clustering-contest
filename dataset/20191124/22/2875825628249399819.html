      <p>After the Trial, Jacqueline said: "I almost enjoyed some parts, it’s so surreal, you’re in a tunnel with Ian Wright and he’s going ‘arghhh’.”</p>
      <p>Ian hilariously brushed off his extravagant reaction as he simply stated: "I touched a couple of things that really frightened me in there."</p>
      <p>He later told the Bush Telegraph: "What you feed off is how happy people are to know you got twelve stars.</p>
      <p>"I’ll sleep really well now because I know I brought it home, I done it, my Jackie helped me through that, she’s one of the strongest women I know."</p>
