      <p>The bodies of five women have been recovered on the Italian island of Lampedusa after their boat capsized in bad sea conditions overnight.</p>
      <p>Three bodies were retrieved at sea while two more were found on a beach, the Coast guard said, adding that searches were continuing, but that bad weather was complicating the effort.</p>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon 149 people, including 13 women and three children, were rescued from their boat as it was sinking.</p>
      <p>There are reports that around 20 more migrants are missing at sea.</p>
      <p>The ten metre long vessel was reported in distress less than one mile off Lampedusa, the Coast Guard said.</p>
      <p>Among the group of mostly Central and West Africans were three women, two toddlers and 24 unaccompanied minors who braved the dangerous crossing in search of a better life in Europe.</p>
      <p>On Sunday the captain of the charity rescue ship Open Arms failed to get permission from Italy to disembark 62 African migrants.</p>
      <p>But on Sunday afternoon the authorities did evacuate 11 migrants in need of medical assistance whilst the ship was at sea. At least one was suffering from a gunshot wound.</p>

      <p>The Italian government has taken a hard line against immigration and has previously resisted attempts by rescue ships to land migrants in its territory.</p>
      <p>A prolonged standoff with the Open Arms this summer was only resolved after a court ordered authorities to open a port, allowing 100 migrants to disembark.</p>
      <p>There have been nearly 1,000 confirmed deaths on the three main migration routes across the Mediterranean so far this year, according to the International Organisation for Migration.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of migrants have died in recent years trying to make the Mediterranean crossing from northern Africa to Italy.</p>
