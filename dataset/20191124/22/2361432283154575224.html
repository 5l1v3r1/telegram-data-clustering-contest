      <h1>'SNL' Spoofs Democratic Debate With All-Star Lineup of Will Ferrell, Maya Rudolph, Woody Harrelson and More (Video)</h1>
      <h2>Yes, Larry David returns as Bernie Sanders</h2>

      <p>“Saturday Night Live” packed more all-star cameos into a single sketch about the NBC News Democratic presidential debate than we’ve seen in some entire seasons — and that’s not even counting the appearance of Ryan Reynolds and Tracy Morgan during guest host Will Ferrell’s opening monologue.</p>
      <p>In addition to Ferrell as billionaire Tom Steyer, we saw the return of Larry David’s Bernie Sanders, Woody Harrelson’s Joe Biden, and Maya Rudolph’s Kamala Harris. Plus “SNL” alums Rachel Dratch as Amy Klobuchar and Fred Armisen as <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/michael-bloomberg-officially-enters-2020-presidential-race/">newly announced candidate Michael Bloomberg</a>.</p>
      <p>Given the sheer number of performers on stage, the sketch was understandably a bit of a grab-bag. Harrelson’s Biden noted his proneness to verbal gaffes, saying that Americans were “scared I’ll say something off-color. Or even worse, on-color.”</p>

      <p>David’s Sanders did a coffeehouse riff on economic disparity: “Is it fair that only the top 2% often get a free biscotti with their coffee?”</p>
      <p>And Dratch’s Klobuchar couldn’t stop her shaking.</p>
      <p>But current “SNL” cast members walked off with some of the best lines, including Colin Jost as Pete Buttigieg saying that he was wearing his “First Communion” suit and Kate McKinnon’s Elizabeth Warren poking fun at her previous claims of Native American ancestry while acknowledging her “mom-hosting-Thanksgiving energy.”</p>
      <p>“Of course this Thanksgiving I’ll be cooking … the food of my ancestors — should I say it? I’m gonna say it — maize,” she joked.</p>
      <p>The crowded stage also included Bowen Yang as Andrew Yang, Chris Redd as Cory Booker (Chris Redd), Cecily Strong as Tulsi Gabbard and Melissa Villasenor as MSNBC moderator Rachel Maddow.</p>
