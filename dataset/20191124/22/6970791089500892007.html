      <p>Turk <a href="https://twitter.com/sohh/status/1198723409833791489">hit up Instagram</a> to share and react to the hefty accusation.</p>

      <p>A few years ago, <a href="https://starcasm.net/mendeecees-release/">Harris denied speculation</a> and buzz about possibly snitching on rap artists like Juelz Santana in exchange for getting a lighter drug conviction sentence.</p>
      <p>The most prominent Mendeecees snitch denial came on the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/taxseason/the-mendeecees-harris-episode">Tax Season podcast</a>, recorded just a few days before Mendeecees’ sentence began. “Who in their right mind would go against the feds?” he wondered, when asked directly if there had been any snitching on his part. Mendeecees was also asked about the rumor that he had turned in Juelz Santana and Vado to get a lighter sentence for himself. “I didn’t know them when they were in the streets,” Mendeecees responded. He added, “[Vado] was never selling no drugs….[The fact that] people believe everything they read is sad.” (Starcasm)</p>
      <p>Mendeecees <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/2770793/lhhny-star-mendeecees-harris-no-snitch-yandy-smith-continues-to-support-incarcerated-husband/">reportedly faced double digit time</a> behind bars in his case.</p>
      <blockquote>As for the claims that Mendeecees was looking at a 20-year sentence, he claims that was never even on the table. According to the incarcerated <i>LHHNY</i> star, the plea deal was always for 10 years. The idea of a 20-year sentence hinged on Mendeecees going to trial and losing but that did not happen. Ultimately, the judge sentenced Mendeecees to 97 months with an additional five years of probation. (Inquisitr)</blockquote>
      <p>Harris is <a href="https://thegrio.com/2019/07/19/mendeecees-harris-scheduled-released-from-prison-in-2020/">expected to get released</a> from prison in 2020.</p>
      <blockquote>After being incarcerated for several years on drug-related charges, a <a href="https://thegrio.com/2019/07/15/police-body-cam-love-hip-hop-atlanta-benzino-racist-meltdown/"><i>Love &amp; Hip Hop: New York</i></a> star may finally be returning home to his loved ones and then possibly back to our television screens. <b>Mendeecees Harris</b>, husband of fellow LHHNY star, <b>Yandy Smith</b>, is set to be released from federal prison in November 2020, reports <a href="https://bossip.com/1755460/lhhnys-mendeecees-harris-is-getting-out-of-prison-waay-early-exclusive/?utm_source=bossip_content_widget&amp;utm_medium=sidebar_trending_widget&amp;utm_campaign=content_widget"><i>Bossip. </i></a>He was sentenced in 2015 to at least eight years for drug trafficking, but was given 15 months time served, which was the amount of time he was incarcerated before bail was set.
