      <p>Getting cut by the Mets was the best thing that could’ve happened to Travis d’Arnaud.</p>
      <p>After getting his career back on track with the Rays, the 30-year-old catcher cashed in by signing a two-year, $16 million deal with the Braves on Sunday, the team announced.</p>
      <p>D’Arnaud was released by the Mets in May. He quickly signed with the Dodgers, for whom d’Arnaud appeared in just one game before being traded to the Rays. He quickly became a key piece for a Tampa Bay team which went 96-66 to grab the second wild-card spot in the American League. The Rays defeated Oakland in the wild card game and pushed Houston to Game 5 in the ALDS before bowing out.</p>
      <p>In 92 regular-season games with the Rays, d’Arnaud hit .263 with 16 homers and 67 RBIs. He struggled in the playoffs, though, going just 2-for-19 with two RBIs in six games.</p>
      <p>Originally viewed as the key piece in the R.A. Dickey trade with the Blue Jays which netted the Mets Noah Syndergaard, d’Arnaud had his share of ups and downs across parts of seven seasons with the Mets. He played just four games in 2018 before suffering an elbow an injury, which required Tommy John surgery.</p>
      <p>Upon his return this year, d’Arnaud went 2-for-23 in 10 appearances with the Mets before they decided to get rid of him about a year after he underwent the elbow surgery.</p>
      <p>The Mets signed Wilson Ramos last offseason to a two-year, $19 million contract to be their new starting catcher. Tomas Nido became Ramos’ backup.</p>
      <p>Now d’Arnaud will have a chance to torment his old team as an NL East rival.</p>
