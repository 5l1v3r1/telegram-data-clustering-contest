        <b>BORIS Johnson launched his Tory election manifesto today — and was slammed for being “obsessed” with the SNP.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Prime Minister tore into Nicola Sturgeon and Jeremy Corbyn in the opening comments of his 64-page policy showcase.</p>

      <p>He warned the pair would “team up” if the Tories don’t win the December 12 poll — leading to “two referendums on Brexit and Scotland in 2020”.</p>
      <p>The manifesto’s Scotland section read: “Twelve years of SNP government have led to an obsessive focus on independence — all while Scotland’s public services and its economy have been neglected.”</p>
      <p>But First Minister Ms Sturgeon has said: “The Tories’ panicky obsession with the SNP shows they are running scared of the verdict of the people of Scotland in this election.</p>
      <p>“The Tories’ manifesto shows they remain wedded to dragging Scotland out of the EU against our will, continuing to squeeze spending on essential public services and to trade deals with Donald Trump which threaten our precious NHS in Scotland.”</p>

      <p>As we told on Sunday, the manifesto contained a series of pledges on freezing taxes including VAT and National Insurance for five years.</p>
      <p>It also pledged a review of spirits duty — accounting for nearly three-quarters of the price of a bottle of Scotch whisky.</p>
      <p>On Scotland, the manifesto added: “Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP promised that the 2014 referendum would be a ‘once in a generation’ vote and the result was decisive.</p>
      <p>“We believe that outcome should be respected.”</p>

      <p>At the launch in Telford, Shropshire, Mr Johnson pledged to “get Brexit done” and reunite the country as he unveiled the Tories’ election pledges.</p>
      <p>He said: “It is time to unleash the potential of our country and forge a new Britain.”</p>
      <p>But Labour leader Mr Corbyn branded the plan a “manifesto for billionaires”.</p>
      <p>He said: “All Boris Johnson is offering is more of the same: more cuts, more failure, and years more of Brexit uncertainty.</p>
      <p>"Boris Johnson can’t be trusted.”</p>
