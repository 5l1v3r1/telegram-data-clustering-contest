      <p>Felipe Caicedo fired a dramatic injury-time winner as Lazio clung onto third place in Serie A with a 2-1 win at Sassuolo.</p>
      <p>Caicedo’s late effort after a neat exchange with Luis Alberto ensured his side stretched their winning streak to five games at Mapei Stadium.</p>
      <p>Ciro Immobile had struck Lazio into the lead with a deflected effort just past the half hour mark, but Ciccio Caputo equalised from close range on the stroke of half-time.</p>
