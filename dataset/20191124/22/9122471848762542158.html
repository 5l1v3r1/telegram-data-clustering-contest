      <h1>Why QB Dwayne Haskins Didn’t Take Final Snap In Redskins’ Win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:25:22+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>You may not have noticed depending on where you were, but Dwayne Haskins did not take the final kneeldown snap of the Washington Redskins’ 19-16 win over the Detroit Lions.</p>
      <p>The quarterback who took on that duty was quarterback Case Keenum.</p>
      <p>After the game, Washington interim head coach Bill Callahan explained why Haskins didn’t take the final snap.</p>
      <p>Callahan told the media afterwards that they couldn’t find Haskins when they got the ball back for the kneeldown. As it turns out, Haskins was over by the stands taking a selfie with a fan to celebrate.</p>
      <p>But Callahan didn’t seem to mind, though – too much, anyway.</p>

      <p>Haskins certainly had plenty of reason to be celebrating. It was the first win of his young career, even if it wasn’t the pretty performance he could have had.</p>

      <p>The rookie quarterback went 13 of 29 for 156 yards and an interception, along with 28 rushing yards.</p>
      <p>Detroit had a three-point lead late into the fourth quarter, but a pair of Dustin Hopkins field goals – including one with only 16 seconds remaining – sealed the win for Washington.</p>
      <p>It was their first win since mid-October and their first win at home since Week 7 of 2018.</p>
      <p>You’d better believe that Haskins was ready to celebrate with the fans.</p>
