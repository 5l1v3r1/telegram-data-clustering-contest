      <h1>Russian Hockey Host Goes Viral For Dancing Topless With Pineapples Over Boobs (VIDEO + PICS)</h1>

      <p>Russian hockey host Yulia Ushakova is back in the news again a little over a year after she made waves by posing lying scantily-clad on a treatment table while wearing nothing but a thong.</p>
      <p>The former body-builder defended her actions then, stating, “Honestly, this picture was taken not at a hospital, but at a studio where I undergo cosmetic procedures,” the former Miss Olympia said.</p>
      <blockquote>“I was really surprised that a simple picture of my bottom could cause such a massive public outcry, because Instagram is full of similar photos.”<br/><br/>“I don’t know who decided to share this photo [on Twitter], I just think Spartak were simply charmed by my well-rounded behind and they posted the picture with no intention of hyping things up,” she added.</blockquote>
      <p>Well, she’s back in the news for wearing minimal clothes after she posted a video of herself dancing on a boat in Ko Phi Phi Island, Phuket, Thailand while wearing bikini bottoms and no top. All she had were pineapples covering her boobs.</p>
