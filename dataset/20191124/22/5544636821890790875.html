      <p>Beneficiaries of the N-Power scheme are still expectant that the October 2019 stipend payment “alert” will start rolling in on Monday, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>This news medium understands that some of the beneficiaries are expecting the October 2019 stipend to be paid alongside that of November.</p>
      <p>No official statement has been made about the delay in the payment of the October 2019 stipend.</p>
      <p>Already, the beneficiaries are worried about the development and are threatening to go on a protest to demand the payment of the N30, 000 stipends.</p>
      <p>There are even <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/24/n-power-beneficiaries-to-be-sacked-after-october-stipend-payment/">fears in some quarters that the N-Power scheme would be scrapped</a> with beneficiaries sacked.</p>
