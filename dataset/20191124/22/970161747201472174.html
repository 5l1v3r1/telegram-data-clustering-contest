      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> had her life made on tonight’s episode of I’m a Celebrity when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> compared her to her idol, Kylie Jenner.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-two has made no secret of her love of the Kardashian clan, which has given her lots of ammunition now she’s stuck in a jungle with Caitlyn, the parental figure of the famous fam.</p>
      <p>Having a deep and meaningful chat with Cait and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a> about overcoming her fears for the bushtucker challenge, Jacqueline admitted that she struggled with her self-esteem, and looked for things that made her feel back.</p>

      <p>Giving her encouragement, especially after she got 12 stars for the camp, Caitlyn told her: ‘After you came back and you were all happy and that good feeling you should be and you reminded me of Kylie.</p>

      <p>‘Enthusiastic, like wow, here we go. We’re doing this, wow that was fun, you know.  It’s very much that way.’</p>
      <p>Obviously it was the compliment to end all compliments for Jacqueline, who couldn’t hide how chuffed she was in the bush telegraph.</p>

      <p>‘How cool is that?!,’ she declared with her mouth open. ‘Caitlyn Jenner just casually said “oh you remind me of Kylie.” Winning. Winning!’</p>
      <p>‘She always looks out for me Caitlyn,’ the soap star then added. ‘She always notices when I’m down, she notices when I need picking up, and she’s just really, really an amazing person.’</p>
      <p>During the blunt chat, Caitlyn also spoke openly about her transition, including the surgery she’s undergone over the years.</p>
