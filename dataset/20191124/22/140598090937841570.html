      <h1>New chief executive of UK Athletics on brink of being suspended from roles over safeguarding scandal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/ben-rumsby0/" target="_blank">Ben Rumsby</a></address>
      <p>The new chief executive of UK Athletics is on the brink of being suspended from her roles with the upcoming Commonwealth Games over a safeguarding scandal.</p>
      <p>In a move that will pile pressure on UKA to delay Zara Hyde Peters’s start date there, the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> has learnt that the Commonwealth Games Federation has asked Birmingham 2022 to cut ties with her until her future is resolved.</p>
      <p>Hyde Peters is fighting to hold on to her job even before it begins <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2019/11/22/incoming-uk-athletics-chief-faces-questions-husbands-coaching/">amid claims her husband was wrongly allowed to continue coaching and managing at a club where she was vice-chair</a> after he was banned from teaching over an “inappropriate relationship” with a 15-year-old schoolgirl.</p>
      <p>Hyde Peters also stands accused of having “undermined” a bullying inquiry into another coach at Coventry Godiva Harriers and of being too close to Sir Mo Farah and Paula Radcliffe to oversee UKA’s review of its relationship with the disgraced Nike Oregon Project.</p>
      <p>The <i>Telegraph</i> has learnt the CGF has written to Birmingham 2022 recommending Hyde Peters is suspended from its board and as chair of its Athletes’ Advisory Committee pending an investigation into accusations made by Martin Slevin, a recently-retired detective chief inspector and former chair of Coventry Godiva.</p>
      <p>The CGF declined to comment on its recommendation last night but it is unthinkable Birmingham 2022 would defy it, something that would crank up the pressure on UKA to take similar action to postpone Hyde Peters’ Sunday start date.</p>
      <p>There was already pressure on UK Sport to conduct a full-scale inquiry into Slevin’s claims after he declared he had no faith in the sport’s leaders to get to the truth.</p>
      <p>The elite funding body on Friday entered into “urgent discussions” with UKA to “establish the facts” of what it acknowledged were “extremely serious” accusations.</p>
      <p>It also warned that the taxpayer and National Lottery money it handed to sports – in athletics’ case nearly £27 million in the build-up to next year’s Olympics – was “contingent on a sport meeting standards set out by the Child Protection in Sport Unit (CPSU) and the Ann Craft Trust (in relation to Adults at Risk)”.</p>
      <p>The chair of UKA, Chris Clark, responded by promising to “clarify the facts” of the case – although he also stressed he “fully” supported Hyde Peters’ appointment.</p>
      <p>Slevin said he would take evidence he had against Hyde Peters and her husband, Mike Peters, to UK Sport, rather than UKA, which he accused of failing to investigate properly after he first alerted it to the latter’s alleged activities more than three years ago.</p>
      <p>Peters was permanently barred from teaching in October 2012 over what a damning judgment found to be “very serious” misconduct, which included an “exchange of inappropriate photographs” with a vulnerable pupil while a PE teacher at Bilton High School, Warwickshire.</p>
      <p>He had been cleared six years earlier of sexually assaulting the same girl during a trial at Warwickshire Crown Court.</p>
      <p>Hyde Peters, who has not responded to repeated requests for comment, is understood to be adamant she and her husband abided by safeguarding rules at Coventry Godiva before relocating to Hampshire in 2017.</p>
      <p>She worked at UKA between 2000 and 2008, including as director of athlete development, before joining British Triathlon and overseeing the emergence of the Brownlee brothers.</p>
