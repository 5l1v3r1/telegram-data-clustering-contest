      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> declared her now iconic Vanity Fair cover a big ‘f*** you to haters’ as she opened up about her transition on I’m a Celebrity.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old reality star spoke bluntly and honestly about her transition in the public eye, which became fully realised in a 2015 issue of the fashion magazine.</p>
      <p>Talking to her gal pals <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a>, Caitlyn spoke about the landmark moment for both her and the magazine, and said that she thought it was “extraordinarily important”.</p>

      <p>‘For me, this was a big FU to the millions and millions of people out there that had said terrible things about me,’ she said. ‘And it just came out and it just shocked them.’</p>
      <p>Cheered on by the girls, Jacqueline later said in the bush telegraph: ‘I love the fact that she talks so openly and she feels like she can trust us and speak to us so openly and she puts everything into perspective as well.</p>
      <p>‘Like everybody goes through something.  She’s like the amount of strength that woman has is amazing.’</p>

      <p>Speaking about her transition further, Caitlyn elaborated further, including her previous attempts at transition in the 80s, which she stopped when she met and married Kris Jenner in 1991.</p>
      <p>‘Over many, many years I had a lot but then near the end it went pretty quickly because you can do your face and your chest all at the same time which they did,’ she explained.</p>
      <p>‘Actually for guys if they go on oestrogen, they will grow boobs ok.  And in my case I was on oestrogen back in the 80s and had a little 36/38B and then I met Kris and had them chopped off.</p>
      <p>‘I was so confused in my life.’</p>

      <p>‘The second time round 25 years later I was back on oestrogen obviously and they came back some but not much,’ Caitlyn continued.</p>
      <p>‘So I really had to have them done so it is kind of past the point of no return.’</p>
