      <p>Jason Garrett can’t seem to catch a break sometimes.</p>
      <p>Following a trend with this team, the Dallas Cowboys offense were making their way off the field in the first quarter to get ready for a special teams pump. Dak Prescott was seen jogging to the sidelines while head coach Jason Garrett clapped and extended his hand for a high five.</p>
      <p>Dak ran right past him without acknowledging his existence.</p>

      <p>Dak likely never saw him as he was looking off to his right upon making his way to the sidelines.</p>
