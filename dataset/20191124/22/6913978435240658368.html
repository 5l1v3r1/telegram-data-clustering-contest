      <p><b>Saudi Gazette report<br/><br/>RIYADH </b>— Saudi Arabia’s Chief of the General Staff Gen. Fayyadh Al-Ruwaili opened on Sunday the First Saudi International Maritime Forum in the presence of a number of commanders and heads of concerned bodies in the marine environment and navies of friendly countries.<br/><br/>The three-day event is being held under the patronage of Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman, deputy premier and minister of defense. The Forum titled “The importance of securing strategic sea routes”, which is being organized by the Saudi Royal Navy Forces, will conclude on Nov. 26.<br/><br/>In his inaugural speech, Al-Ruwaili said that the forum discusses ways to secure these routes, and how to deal with the ongoing threats and their impact on the global economy, as well as to ensure the safety of sea routes.<br/><br/>Addressing the forum, Commander of the Royal Saudi Naval Forces Lt. Gen. Fahd Al-Ghufaili said this forum comes in light of the region’s threats to the corridors and navigation lines that require everyone to work together to secure and enhance maritime security.<br/><br/>“The importance of securing strategic maritime corridors has been chosen as the theme of this forum, and this shows the Kingdom’s consistent efforts in boosting international peace and security, as well as the role of the armed forces, represented by the maritime forces, in cooperation with the forces of the friendly countries, in supporting regional and international efforts of protecting strategic sea lanes,” he said.<br/><br/>Al-Ghufaili highlighted the significance of securing maritime traffic and thus preserving global economy and combating illegal acts that threaten maritime security in light of the strategic location enjoyed by the region sandwiched between three continents, in addition to the fact that all countries of the world depend on these seas as their main means of transport as well as traffic routes of exports and imports.<br/><br/>“Maritime transport lines linking the East and the West are important dimensions internationally and the region is one of the world’s most important sources of bioenergy,” Al-Ghufaili said while identifying the major threats to the region’s maritime security as targeting, detention and harming of commercial ships; threat of closing the straits; the use of booby-trapped boats by armed militias; the increasing activity of smuggling of people, weapons, drugs and coal, and the threat of coastal missiles to the maritime traffic.<br/><br/>In his address, Dr. Andreas Scheuer, CEO of the Saudi Military Industries Company, said that the company is going to enhance the defense capabilities of the defense forces in the Kingdom to develop the military industry, products and services, in pursuit of achieving the Kingdom’s Vision 2030.<br/><br/>He stressed that the forum will provide with a distinct platform to share and discuss matters of high importance to protect the global maritime strategic corridors.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Al-Ruwaili opened an exhibition, on the sidelines of the forum, in which the world’s leading companies are showcasing their latest systems, technologies and equipment in the marine environment sector.</p>
