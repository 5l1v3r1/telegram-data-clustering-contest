      <p>This is fine, for now, as far as Chelsea are concerned. A brave ­performance that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/manchester-city-vs-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-latest">ended in a 2-1 ­defeat away to the reigning champions</a>, Manchester City, it might even be argued it was more evidence of progress being made, although it will not always be so easy for Frank Lampard to shrug off a loss.</p>
      <p>Chelsea have exceeded expectations at the start of his first year as manager. Lampard has done a good job so far, sending out a young, dynamic team with the intent to hurt the opposition, rather than contain them, home or away.</p>
      <p>This is not a cautious Chelsea side, they are bold and adventurous; they have a bit of style, a bit of a swagger. It makes them easy to like, exciting to watch, especially when so many young players have been given a chance to shine and Lampard is a young British manager, given a rare opportunity to manage one of the big clubs, rather than scratch around – as most are forced to do – at clubs with far bigger problems than a one-year transfer ban.</p>
      <p>He has seized that opportunity, handled himself well and defied those who predicted Chelsea would struggle to compete for a Champions League place, while hushing anyone who suggested he was too inexperienced and too reliant on his status as a former player to be a successful manager.</p>
      <p>Yet, this is Chelsea, a club that has won the Premier League five times and expect to do so again at some point. </p>
      <p>A top-four finish has not been deemed good enough for the managers who have come before him and, eventually, it will not be good enough for Lampard either. For all the optimism, the fact Chelsea have lost to Liverpool, City and Manchester United (twice) this season is a reminder of their limitations.</p>
      <p>This is the easy part, when less is required or demanded. Lampard is the club legend who has come home, idolised and adored. The pressure is off, to an extent. He has that most precious of commodities as a manager – time. The<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/22/real-jody-morris-tough-west-london-lad-became-indispensable/"> time to mould a new type of team</a>, the time to let some of those thrilling academy graduates develop and the time for him to learn and grow, until he is ready to win the same trophies his predecessors have lifted.</p>
      <p>Yet, one of the things that makes Lampard likeable, is he recognises all of this. There is no bluff or bluster, no pointing to the fact Chelsea are only the second team to enjoy more possession than Man City, at the Etihad, since Pep Guardiola arrived three years ago, no hard luck tales or excuses. Just an acceptance City won and Chelsea lost.</p>
      <p>“I think it is an experience [on a learning curve],” said Lampard. “Some of them, it is their first experience at this stadium, against the high-level team City are. I think you always learn, young or old, from these kinds of games.</p>
      <p>“I think there is a lot we did well, individually and collectively, and some things we were slightly off with that we can improve on. We need to go through these experiences if we are going to get where we want to be.</p>
      <p>“Are we ahead of the curve this season? I’m really happy with a lot of our stuff this season, so maybe that means we are slightly ahead of the curve.</p>
      <p>“But in football, the curve will go downhill very fast if you don’t keep on yourself, take a lot of the lessons from Saturday and take them on moving forward.”</p>
      <p>Lampard was not the only manager able to enjoy a little escape from the usual stress and strains of his job. Pep Guardiola seems to be enjoying himself at the moment, letting all the pressure burden league leaders Liverpool, as City lurk in the distance, still in the race but only just. </p>
      <p>His team “have not given up” on the title but it would not be “a disaster” if they did not win it this time given they won four trophies last term. He is conscious, of course, that Liverpool are also trying to win the title for the first time in 30 years and have let opportunities slip away from them before. If City win from here, it would be a nice surprise, but if Liverpool lose it from this position, it really would be a disaster for Jurgen Klopp and his players.</p>
