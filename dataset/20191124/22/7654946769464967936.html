      <h1>Jets report card: Adam Gase deserves credit for Raiders destruction</h1>

        <i>Grading the Jets after their <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/24/jets-completely-dominate-raiders-for-third-straight-win/">34-3 win over the Oakland Raiders</a> on Sunday.</i>
      </p>
      <h3>Offense</h3>
      <p>Adam Gase was in a groove calling plays and the Jets offense looks rejuvenated. They gained 401 yards, the second straight week they hit 400 yards. QB Sam Darnold (20 of 29, 315 yards, 2 passing TDs, 1 rushing TD, 127.8 rating) did not turn the ball over and made some beautiful throws. WR Robby Anderson (4 catches, 86 yards, 1 TD) had his best game in weeks. The offensive line opened some holes and allowed just one sack. It was a complete performance by the offense.</p>

      <h3>Defense</h3>
      <p>Jamal Adams said the Jets were upset they gave up the three points. That is about the only negative you can take away from this one. They shut down Josh Jacobs (10 rushes, 34 yards) and forced QB Derek Carr (15 of 27, 127 yards, 1 INT, 52.5 rating) to the bench in the third quarter. Gregg Williams’ group was suffocating, allowing 208 total yards. CB Brian Poole capped it off with a pick-six that put the game away.</p>

      <h3>Special teams</h3>
      <p>The only group dragging down the GPA this week, and it is only because of two miscues. Kicker Sam Ficken missed a 48-yard field goal, but did hit two others. Punt returner Braxton Berrios inexplicably let a punt drop inside the Jets’ 10. He later had a return of 26 yards, so he made up for it. The coverage team was good, bottling up Raiders returner Trevor Davis.</p>

      <h3>Coaching</h3>
      <p>If you were ripping Adam Gase a month ago, you have to give him credit now. Gase kept the Jets together and has them on a three-game winning streak. His play-calling was terrific on Sunday and he had the offense rolling. Gregg Williams matched him with a great defensive game plan that shut the Raiders down.</p>
