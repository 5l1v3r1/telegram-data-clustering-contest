      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) -A 55-year-old man turned himself in to police Sunday morning in connection to a hit-and-run that left a Makakilo woman dead.</p>
      <p>The suspect was identified as 55-year-old Nelson D. Hagmoc. He turned himself in to the Kapolei Police Station around 10:15 a.m. where he was subsequently arrested on a count of causing a deadly accident.</p>
      <p>Police also recovered a black Ford utility van.</p>
      <p>“I feel relief but I also feel I got justice for my sister,” the victim’s sister Kuulei Espiritu said. “It’s hard right now, but I feel that my sister wants me to send out a message to the world: They need to learn to slow down and be cautious on the road. Be very cautious.”</p>
      <p>The crash, which happened around 6:50 p.m. on Wednesday, killed 39-year-old Puanani Borreta.</p>
      <p>Borreta was crossing Makakilo Drive, just south of Palailai Street when she was hit. Police said she was not in a marked crosswalk at the time.</p>
