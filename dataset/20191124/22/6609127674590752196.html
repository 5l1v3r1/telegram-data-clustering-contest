        <b>FLO KAMBERI revealed Sergio Porrini sold him on a switch to Albania.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14943/hibernian/">Hibs</a> striker was called up to their international squad for the clashes with France and Andorra earlier this month.</p>

      <p>Kamberi can also play for Switzerland and Kosovo but made the decision to commit his future to the Albanians after a meeting in Scotland with ex-<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> defender Porrini.</p>
      <p>He’s No2 to boss Megrim Mavraj so flew to watch the Hibs man in action against Celtic recently.</p>
      <p>Kamberi will have to wait for his first cap after paperwork wasn’t lodged in time to face the French, but insists he’s made up his mind who he’ll play for.</p>
      <p>He said: “The assistant coach with Albania is Sergio Porrini, who used to play for Rangers. He came over to the Celtic game, watched me playing and the next day met with my agent and my father.</p>

      <p>“We had a good chat, they made it clear they really want me because they want to build a new team and have a new era.</p>
      <p>“I want to be a big part of it.</p>
      <p>“Having Sergio there is good because some people think playing in Scotland is easy, but it’s not, it’s very tough.</p>
      <p>“Most people just know <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> and Rangers and they think it’s easy, but he knows the league and the clubs in it.</p>
      <p>“It’s good to have someone who can see your quality and wants to work with you. Having international football is a motivation, if you have that chance it’s a privilege.”</p>
      <p>Kamberi played for the Swiss U21 side so will need to transfer his registration to the Albanians.</p>
      <p>And that admin hold up cost him the chance to play against the European champions.</p>
      <p>He said: “I did everything on my part to be ready, I went there and wanted to make my debut. I just have to be patient.”</p>
