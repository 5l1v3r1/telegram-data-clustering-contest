        <b>It was only a matter of time before I’m A Celebrity merged with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a> but we were not prepared for the quease-inducing antics on the daybeds.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This year’s batch of campmates, including <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ian-wright/">Ian Wright</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a>, had to take part in Jungle Love Island in order to win roast dinners during Sunday night’s live challenge.</p>
      <p>Only, the bikini-clad islanders were replaced with all kinds of creepy crawlies from snakes to critters, as the campmates were put through gruelling tasks to win stars for their dinner.</p>
      <p>First up, Caitlyn, Jacqueline and Ian had to do a spot of apple-bobbing to find stars buried in a pie filled with – wait for it – a delightful cocktail of slime and cockroaches.</p>
      <p>Cliff, Adele, Roman and James were up next and had 90 seconds to get as many pig testicles from one bowl to the next but were only allowed to do so using their mouths.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Yes, you guessed it, they literally had to pass the testicles to each other, one-by-one by clasping it in their teeth.</p>
      <p>And we’re going to need a bucket.</p>

      <p>Andrew had to drink a milkshake called Caroline Yack, which featured blended cockroaches, while Caitlyn had to knock back a drink called Ian Hurling, featuring blended vomit fruit. Ian was also given blended pigs penises to win his roast dinner because apparently the slime and cockroaches pie from earlier wasn’t enough.</p>
      <p>Although, perhaps it was made a little better by the fact they got to sit in the hot tub?</p>
      <p>Amber, Anna and co. could never.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, James and Roman weren’t able to win their challenge of unscrewing stars in boxes filled with crabs, bees and other creatures.</p>

      <p>When hosts Ant &amp; Dec asked what went wrong during the challenge, James snapped back: ‘What went wrong? The very fact there was a giant crab in the way that you wanted me to carefully caress in a different direction while I was turning a star in his face.’</p>
      <p>After they called him ‘crabby’, James explained: ‘It was difficult but obviously the crab wouldn’t get out the way and you had to screw it so fast.’</p>
      <p>Ian, Cliff and Andy were the only campmates who wouldn’t be receiving roast dinners after failing their challenges.</p>

      <p>On the bright side, at least they took a quick trip to the Love Island villa.</p>
