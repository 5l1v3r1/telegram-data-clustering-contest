      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Raheem Sterling will be named on the shortlist for next month’s public vote after his remarkable 12 months both on and off the pitch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T22:30:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Raheem Sterling has been nominated for the BBC’s prestigious Sports Personality of the Year award.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> star Sterling will be named on the shortlist for next month’s public vote after his remarkable 12 months both on and off the pitch.</p>
      <p>Viewers will pick the winner from those nominated after a big year in British sport but Sterling is the outstanding choice from the world of football.</p>
      <p>Sterling, 24, won his second consecutive Premier League title last season as City clinched a domestic Treble while he established himself as England’s best player as Gareth Southgate’s team reached the finals of the Nations League.</p>

      <p>But the SPOTY nomination is also recognition for his off-the-field work and his stance as English football’s most prominent anti-racism campaigner.</p>
      <p>Sterling won widespread praise last year for taking to social media after being abused by fans at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and that sparked a self-enforced review within the media and football.</p>
      <p>He is also fronting up a Premier League anti-racism campaign while he also spent tens of thousands to buy tickets for pupils at his old school near Wembley for them to go to last season’s FA Cup semi final.</p>
      <p>Sterling is now one of the most recognisable and high-profile footballers in Europe and the game’s most important voice on racism while his performances have gone from strength to strength.</p>

      <p>There is likely to be stiff competition from the likes of cricket star Ben Stokes but football remains Britain’s biggest sport.</p>
      <p>City have begun talks on a new long-term contract to keep their prized asset even though Sterling only signed a new deal 12 months ago.</p>
      <p><i>Mirror Sport</i> understands that Sterling will be happy to commit himself to City and his new deal does not depend on Pep Guardiola’s future.</p>
