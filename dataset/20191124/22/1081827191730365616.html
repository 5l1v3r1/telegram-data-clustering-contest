      <p>Whether you love her or not, <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/kim-kardashian-white-house/">Kim Kardashian</a> never fails to surprise… and tonight was no different.</p>
      <p>The businesswoman, law student and reality star extraordinaire sat down with Lisa Wilkinson on <i>The Sunday Project</i> to chat about her family life and her relationship with Kanye West.</p>
      <p>During the interview, Kim – who wore an incredibly comfy looking bathrobe – also spoke about her emerging legal career and discussed how she “empathises” with <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/gifts-for-new-mums/">Prince Harry and Meghan</a>, Duchess of Sussex.</p>
      <p>The whole interview is filled with interesting tidbits, but these are the three talking points that stood out most for us – from her controversial Met Gala dress to her parenting group chat.</p>

      <h3>1. Kim’s Met Gala dress which Kanye called “too sexy” was initially going to have nipples on it.</h3>
      <p>In May this year, Kim stepped out on the Met Gala red carpet looking noticeably <i>erm.</i>..<i> </i>wet<i>.</i></p>
      <p>The 38-year-old wore a <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/kim-kardashian-met-gala-waist-2019/">tight nude coloured dress dripping with sparkling crystals</a> and had her long hair slicked back to give the impression she had just emerged from the ocean.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until months later on <i>Keeping Up with Kardashians</i> that we learnt Kanye didn’t like her dress because it was “too sexy”. And it “affects him when pictures are too sexy.”</p>
      <p>After the episode aired, fans of the show were quick to call out Kanye for being too controlling.</p>

      <p>Tonight we learnt what Kanye’s main problem was with the dress. And it was because the original design featured nipples.</p>
      <p>“The one part that it didn’t show is the dress, because it was supposed to be wet looking coming out of the water, it had nipples on it and so he really wanted that taken off, and he had mentioned that a few times because if you wear a wet dress and you were actually coming out of the water you would probably see that, and so we compromised and we took that off the dress,” said Kim.</p>
      <p>Kim decided to keep the conversation about the dress in the episode because she wanted to give fans a look at what her relationship with Kanye is actually like in real life.</p>
      <p>“Him and I talked about that and it was something that was important for him to show on the show because that’s where he is in his life.</p>
      <p>“I also think, for me just to show every picture-perfect moment of my life is just sort of the Instagram version of the show and my show has never been like that. My show has always been exactly who we are and it’s totally natural that a husband and wife would in like different places in life and have different ideas about things and having disagreements about things like that,” she added.</p>
      <p>“It’s how you handle it and how you compromise and how you and what comes about that really shapes our relationship.”</p>
      <h3>2. The Kardashian sisters have a group parenting chat.</h3>
      <p>Rest assured, even America’s most famous family still need help when it comes to parenting.</p>
      <p>During the interview, Kim shared that she and her sisters have a group chat where she is “always getting advice” on parenting. </p>
      <p>Her sisters’ advice came in handy recently when her daughter North started wearing makeup and Kanye wasn’t too happy about it.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think a kid should really be wearing makeup either, you know. I think sometimes if you don’t understand a rule, it is good to learn and ask your friends. In my case, my siblings and what they would do. Bounce ideas around and develop a way that we’re going to parent and rules that we have. And we always have to stay aligned.”</p>
      <p>Kim also shared that parenting doesn’t come easy when you’re raising kids in the spotlight.</p>
      <p>“I researched parenting probably more than anybody else, from reading tonnes of books to having conversations with a lot of people.</p>
      <p>“I think no matter what you’re given and no matter what you have, you have to treat people with respect and so I do the best that I can and I really do believe that my children are well adjusted and know that they are blessed, but understand to be really compassionate, and they are good people. And that is my number one goal in life,” said Kim.</p>
      <h3>3. Kim empathises with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s need for privacy.</h3>
      <p>During recent months, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been subject to intense media scrutiny from the British press.</p>
      <p>And while they may be famous for <i>very</i> different reasons,  Kim says she relates to Harry and Meghan’s need for privacy from the spotlight.</p>
      <p>“I think their journey is extremely personal, with – you know, what his mother experienced and how her life was so affected by the spotlight and by paparazzi,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think anyone can really understand what that’s like except for them. But I think as I’m older and as I have kids, and what I would want for them is just the safest place.</p>
      <p>“I can definitely empathise with their need for having a secure, safe place and taking time for themselves and having privacy when they need it.”</p>
