      <p>Disney’s new animated movie sequel “Frozen 2” has several key moments you might not see upon a first viewing of the movie. We watched the new film twice to try and catch all of the best Disney references (like nods to “Big Hero Six,” “The Little Mermaid,” and more), plus cool examples of foreshadowing.</p>

      <h3>In the opening flashback, Anna and Elsa are playing with small snow figurines.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/984d8cad9929ed6997d50b4d7583cfd85a7c98c2-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Young Elsa and Queen Iduna together at the start of “Frozen 2.”sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The two young princesses have an array of little snow people and creatures, and there were some Disney characters among them.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>One of the figures is Baymax, the lovable robot from Disney’s 2014 animated movie “Big Hero Six.”</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/c880010f6830370eb13b02170a71cd67411de8ff-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Baymax in Disney’s movie, “Big Hero Six.”sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>We’re also pretty sure we spotted a little “Bolt” dog among the snow figures.</p>
      <p>“Bolt” was a 2008 Walt Disney Animation Studios movie, and marked a new phase for the studio’s direction in animated feature films that led to “Frozen” in 2013.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Both “Bolt” and “Big Hero Six” were codirected by Chris Williams — the same man who voices Oaken in the “Frozen” movies.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/c83eebd1d0a93a052511ea98d975e6e0a89c5824-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Oaken in the first “Frozen” movie.sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Williams is used to wearing many different hats at Walt Disney Animation Studio. He’s an animator, story artist/screenwriter, director, and actor.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>When Anna and Elsa hear the story of the enchanted forest for the first time, there’s a small horse figurine sitting on Elsa’s bedside table.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3d4ca8eb016b225ddf18948cbd8c48bb65a79c7a-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: The carved horse in on the bedside table in the flashback scene.sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Later in the movie, it’s revealed that the water spirit is a mythical horse (called the Nokk). Elsa tames it and rides it to Ahtohallan. The horse’s presence in her childhood flashback was a neat little bit of foreshadowing.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Our first hint that Iduna was the one who saved Agnarr came when little Anna reacted to her father’s story.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/333d7c3f598dbf9bcfdb19fd0dbfc01859219365-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Young Anna and Elsa in “Frozen 2.”sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“Whoever saved you, I love them!” young Anna cries out in the movie before falling into her mother’s lap.</p>
      <p>Upon a rewatch, this is a pretty direct foreshadowing of the reveal that Queen Iduna’s played a key role in saving King Agnarr’s life.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Starting in those flashbacks, we see a lot of important repeating patterns.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/61cd7e59dc04cc315695eb674da09ec86f5f665e-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Queen Iduna in “Frozen 2.”sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The most important of these is of course the four-sided diamond pattern on Queen Iduna’s scarf, which is later revealed to show the four spirit symbols <i>and </i>the “fifth spirit” sign.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>That diamond patter was also on King Agnarr’s coat trim, and we saw it back in the first “Frozen” movie.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ce6461da49a883b517beddb83b6d8c21fc88fc1d-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Iduna and Agnarr in the first “Frozen” movie.sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>That repeating diamond pattern, which later becomes the foundation of Elsa’s new “fifth spirit” symbol, appeared frequently throughout the first movie (usually in connection to Elsa).</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>That new symbol was shown in the very first poster for “Frozen 2.”</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/acf4999b1aa99c55eb7e3aa57918c30f016b3307.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: The unity symbol as seen on the first “Frozen 2” poster.sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Back when the poster and teaser trailer debuted, <a href="https://www.insider.com/frozen-2-element-symbols-explained-2019-9">fans began speculating about the meaning of the small symbols</a> in the middle of each diamond.</p>
      <p>But it turns out the real clue was the entire four-sided “fifth spirit” design.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Anna and Elsa’s first dresses and necklaces we see them wear in “Frozen 2” were hints at how they’d separate by the end of the movie.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/6623e96018350609c80a8bc26842cc6470aa1223-800x599.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Anna and Olaf at the start of “Frozen 2.”sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Throughout “Frozen 2,” Anna is the only one of the two sisters who has distinct Arendelle iconography on her clothes. The small detailing on her dress and the bronze necklace she’s wearing at the beginning of the movie are all pulled from the flags you see around Arendelle.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Elsa is wearing a necklace with her signature half-snowflake design.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>You can see the Arendelle sigil clearly on Lieutenant Mattias’ shield here:</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8b272aee14241d45d478307fcb5210cb2a658148-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Mattias and the other Arendelle soldiers in “Frozen 2.”sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The little floral design is everywhere in Arendelle, and used in the detailing of Anna’s clothing, but it’s never seen on Elsa in “Frozen 2.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Anna was always more connected to Arendelle, both emotionally and literally (through her costuming), so it makes sense she winds up being the Queen.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/efbf03d49af99b8eb0df6da820f5614d048d07d9-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Anna talking to Mattias in “Frozen 2.”sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>And her costuming in “Frozen 2” is inextricably linked to Elsa’s journey, too.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Now let’s take a closer look at Anna’s traveling cloak, which also tells part of the story about her relationship to Elsa and Kristoff.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/69d2eddc73f5097adac97dd21362e719f396962d-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Anna and Elsa in “Frozen 2.”sourceWalt Disney Animation Studios/YouTube</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>When they set out on their journey, Anna is wearing a magenta cape over her black and gold outfit.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The cape Anna wears for the first two acts in “Frozen 2” is a similar color to Elsa’s cape from the first movie.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/4f04049b0397140603b359ee9cdaac311a2c09c2-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Elsa at the beginning of the first “Frozen” movie.sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The cape Elsa wore and then discarded during the iconic “Let It Go” number had an Arendelle sigil on it – further showing her disconnect from the kingdom.</p>
      <p>Anna wearing a cape of the similar color in “Frozen 2” shows a link between her and her sister, and how much Anna is trying to hold onto a way of life that is becoming increasingly untenable.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>It’s only when Elsa literally pushes Anna away and on a different path that the younger princess stops wearing the magenta cape.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/9bf6169a7d6ebf06e2e4a14fc8bcdfc449985ad4-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Olaf and Anna inside the river cave in “Frozen 2.”sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>After Elsa decides to go to find Ahtohollan alone, Anna and Olaf find themselves in a dark cave. Anna’s cape is lost when they fall into the dark river, revealing her black and gold outfit underneath.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Anna is more focused on Elsa than Kristoff for the first part of the movie, and this was reflected in the couples’ costumes.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/f0ea0423fd417c5d10c7bfe770da4f4ee8fda09b-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, and Sven in “Frozen 2.”sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The side story of “Frozen 2” is all about how Anna and Kristoff are having trouble communicating and getting on the same page, largely due to Anna’s focus on her sister.</p>
      <p>When Anna is wearing her traveling cloak, she’s more visually connected to Elsa.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>But once the cloak is gone, Anna’s outfit actually matches the one Kristoff has been wearing the whole time.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/369bfd02a7b7247ca1259f7e9a612b6525d14bdb-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Anna and Kristoff were matching all along underneath.sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>They were synced up the whole time, just underneath some communication problems that needed to be sorted out.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>When Kristoff is singing in “Some Things Never Change,” you can briefly little statues made in the likeness of two Disney animators.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/a17d255d3d73b0e472a74e7d6245456e91d45797-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Sven and Kristoff in the first “Frozen” movie.sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>As Insider learned during a press event for the movie, two “Frozen 2” creators – Mike Giaimo, the production designer, and David Womersley, the art director of environments – were turned into wooden statuettes for the background of this scene.</p>
      <p>Giaimo and Womersley had no idea they were in the film until just a couple of months before it premiered.</p>
      <p>You can spot the two statues in the background a little over halfway through the song at the beginning of the movie, when Kristoff and Sven meet up with Anna on the streets of Arendelle.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>There’s a hidden Mickey somewhere in the scene when Olaf sings “When I Am Older.”</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e30ac1d704ef52cfef0e3a9c4d8cfb1d8c784955-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Olaf looking into the river at the water spirit, Nokk, in “Frozen 2.”sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“There’s one Mickey mouse hidden in there,” the head of animation of “Frozen 2,” Becky Bresee, told Insider. “You have to find it though.”</p>
      <p>So far we haven’t spotted it, but fans should keep an eye out during this song in case they can spot the hidden Mickey.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>You might have noticed that a scene shown in the trailer for “Frozen 2” never appeared in the movie.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fee5d585e89d7d9d0c483935788e44b6d4a14f22-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Anna grabs Kristoff’s sword at the end of the first “Frozen 2” teaser trailer.sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The very first teaser for “Frozen 2” was released in February, and it ended with a dramatic moment showing Anna grabbing a sword from Kristoff and swinging it towards the camera.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>That original scene had already been cut from the movie by the time the teaser premiered, but the fan reaction to it convinced the directors to add it back in somehow.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8a7d41c08a1a0a640aa60af928e8b851ecd3e353-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Anna wields a sword made of ice in “Frozen 2.”sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, the film’s codirectors, told Insider about how people’s love for that moment made them rework it into the movie again.</p>
      <p>“That [scene] was in [the movie] at one point, and then it was out,” Buck said. “We were like, ‘Uh oh, people <i>love </i>that scene.’ So we made it work, but it’s different.”</p>
      <p>The final version of the Anna-sword moment shows her grabbing an ice-sword from a statue instead of a real sword from Kristoff.</p>

      <h3>Kristoff’s song “Lost in the Woods” was invoking lots of ’80s rock ballads, and also gave a nod to “Bohemian Rhapsody.”</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/a547ccddc0971da628bfbf01c0b93f77779416e6-800x600.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>At one point during “Lost in the Woods,” we see Kristoff surrounded by singing reindeer in the exact same arrangement as the above music video from Queen for their seminal hit “Bohemian Rhapsody.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Jonathan Groff was singing the voices of 18 different reindeer for “Lost in the Woods.”</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cf0e86172bd9d1f6c015aba1d6593128f046f462-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Kristoff and Sven in “Frozen 2.”sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>As revealed in <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/jonathan-groff-song-frozen-2-lost-in-the-woods-making-of">a Vanity Fair feature written by Joanna Robinson</a>, actor Jonathan Groff brought to life close to a 20 reindeer for his big ballad.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>When Elsa sees all the snow memories in Ahtohollan, there’s a reference to “The Little Mermaid.”</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/0f7a725caf20d0d68ee5a10d573c68c24c23de17-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: “The Little Mermaid” is another 1800s story adapted by Disney for an animated movie.sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Elsa sees young Iduna ask young Agnarr what he’s reading, and he replies: “Some new Danish author.” On the cover of his book, you can just make out the silhouette of Ariel from “The Little Mermaid.”</p>
      <p>Hans Christian Anderson was the Danish author of both “The Little Mermaid” and “The Snow Queen.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>This could be taken as a hint about what year the “Frozen” take place in.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ab75b5f87dc29d9168a76854883481611a384ebc-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“The Little Mermaid” was published in 1837, and “The Snow Queen” came afterwards in 1844. If young Agnarr was reading the “new” book by Anderson in 1837 as a boy, then that means the current timeframe in the “Frozen” movies could be around the late 1860s or 1870s.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>When Olaf “dies,” his snow is gathered by Gale and dotted with purple flowers.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1cdfd99444f226cf0dead7ee320626fc746a346b-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Olaf and similar purple flowers in the first “Frozen” movie.sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This is likely reference to the scene at the end of “Frozen” when Olaf is finally experiencing warm weather in Arendelle and smells two buckets of purple flowers.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>When Anna is revealed as Queen of Arendelle, her hairstyle when matches Elsa’s original coronation style.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/4618ead8421685ed17c85a38d39cf46ff096d6e8-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Anna and Elsa in the first “Frozen” movie celebrating Elsa’s coronation.sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Anna has a whole new gown (again, dotted with the Arendelle insignia), but her hair is distinctly mirroring the updo Elsa had for <i>her </i>coronation. And both queen’s looks also happen to match their mother’s style we saw in both movies.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The snow goblin in the post-credits scene is wearing Elsa’s crown from the first movie she threw away.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/47c0e5fdbd7f4273c5ebe06112f2bf1f7f814298-800x600.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Foto: Elsa singing “Let it Go” in the first “Frozen” movie.sourceDisney</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>During <a href="https://www.insider.com/frozen-2-post-credits-scene-olaf-2019-11">the post-credits scene</a>, we get a quick look at Elsa’s snow goblin as he listens to Olaf retell the events of “Frozen 2.” Perched on top of the goblin’s head is the little crown Elsa tossed away at the end of “Let it Go” during the first movie.</p>
