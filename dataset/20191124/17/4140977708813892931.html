                            <p>Nevertheless, a few minutes later Manchester United faced disappointed in the game, as Sheffield United scored in the 19th minute from John Fleck’s strike after a rebound from Lundstram’s attempt.</p>
                            <p>Phil Jones made a grave mistake while controlling the ball, near his team’s 18-yard-box  Nobody was able to judge what the English defender intended to do at that time.</p>
                            <p>

                            <p>Irrespective of it, McGoldrick won the ball from Jones and passed the ball inside the 18-yard-box which made De Gea vulnerable and certainly spoilt his hard work to maintain a clean sheet.</p>
