      <p>In May, she was reportedly found unconscious at her home and was taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>She was embroiled last year in public disputes with an ex-boyfriend who claimed to have been assaulted by her.</p>
      <p>Ms Hara accused the man of having threatened to circulate a sex video of her. The case made her the subject of tabloid fodder and malicious online messages.</p>
      <p>In October, another K-pop star and actress, Sulli, was found dead at her home near Seoul.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old was known for her feminist voice and outspokenness that was rare among female entertainers in deeply conservative South Korea.</p>
      <p>Before her death, she appeared in a TV show and spoke out against the online backlash she received over her lifestyle.</p>
