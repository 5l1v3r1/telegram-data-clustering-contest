      <p>Motivating students to learn and participate today can be a very daunting task not only for parents but also for teachers.</p>
      <p>One approach that can be taken by both parents and teachers to stimulate learning and motivate good behaviour is through the use of rewards, and this is exactly what a school in Selangor did.</p>

      <p>Teachers and members of the Parent-Teacher Association (PIBG) of SMK Batu Laut believe that truancy often impacts the process of teaching and learning.</p>
      <p>To foster the importance of attending school among its students, they gave out really cool gifts to students who maintain 100% attendance such as a motorcycle and holiday packages.</p>
      <p>Here are some pictures of the kids receiving their well-deserved gifts.</p>
      <p>Shared by netizen <a href="https://twitter.com/nrqlhosh/status/1197726480383410176">@nrqlhosh</a>, shes writes <b>“This is how my school encourages their students to not skip school.”</b></p>

      <p>Congratulations kids! It’s cool to stay in school!</p>
      <p>In her thread, she writes, “Students who maintain a 100% attendance record stand a chance to win the grand prize in a lucky draw.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Those who were unlucky were also given a token of appreciation but not as great as those who were among the winners.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>See, everyone gets a fair share of the pie.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Hey, it is never wrong to reward students for attending schools and we hope that they continue to stay in school for the sake of education after this. </i>
