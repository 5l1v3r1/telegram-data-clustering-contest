      <h1>Bethany England demonstrates why she is WSL's most feared striker with two goals in Chelsea's big win at Birmingham</h1>

        <b>Birmingham 0-6 Chelsea</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ease with which Bethany England scored Chelsea’s sixth goal yesterday, with just under half an hour left to play, epitomised not only why a player who only earned <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/04/02/bethany-england-can-still-play-part-world-cup-plans-insists/">her first senior England call-up</a> is probably the most-feared striker in the Women’s Super League right now, but why Chelsea, and their ruthless, almost mechanical efficiency, are the only side still unbeaten in the league this season.</p>
      <p>Here they swung past Birmingham’s defence like VIPs into a nightclub. It took Chelsea two and three minutes respectively to open the scoring in either half. The goals kept coming and you could have set your watch by England’s gambolling runs from wide, or Millie Bright’s drilled passes over the top.</p>
      <p>First there was Ji So-yun’s deft free-kick, sailing into the top corner despite the faintest of touches from Birmingham goalkeeper Hannah Hampton.</p>
      <p>If there is any consolation for the home side it is that there was a half an hour spell, inside the first half, where they did not look like a team about to fall to their fifth league defeat in seven.</p>
      <p>Bar Ji’s free-kick, Hampton had not had a save to make until Chelsea’s second and Birmingham had repeatedly drawn Maren Mjelde into sliding saves from Abbi Grant and Harriet Scott. Lily Simkin and Lucy Staniforth were both persistent threats.</p>

      <p>The bad news is that there were plenty of instances where they did look like a struggling team. The warning signs were there when Bright coasted in from halfway, brushing off defenders, and drove from the edge of area into the far corner. It will terrify them that the Chelsea manager Emma Hayes thinks this squad can still be so much better.</p>
      <p>"I’m not happy with the performance," she said. "After the first goal, I thought we were too passive – we didn’t do enough defensively. It took us a while to get going. Good goals, but overall I think we’re going to have to improve."</p>
      <p>England demonstrated her lightness of touch to bring down Bright’s lofted delivery and then slam it into the far corner for Chelsea’s third goal.</p>
      <p>The goalscorer then turned provider with a smart, inch-perfect back-heel into the path of Drew Spence, for Chelsea’s fourth. Spence’s powerful header from Ji’s cross made it five before England rolled home Chelsea’s sixth after ducking beneath her marker.</p>
      <p>This is Birmingham’s heaviest defeat since a summer of huge turnover that saw the departure of 10 first-team players – including Ellen White – a general manager, a goalkeeping coach and a head of youth development.</p>
      <p>Events on the field – leaking goals at a rate of two a league game and scoring just twice in the league – have given the impression to outsiders that if things head any further south the club will no longer be in the Midlands. They are second from bottom – a shadow of the team that finished fourth last season –and light years behind Chelsea.</p>
      <p>"Right now, there’s a big gap, and I wasn’t expecting it at the beginning of the league," said Birmingham head coach Marta Tejedor. "I thought the league would be much, much more tight, but after playing Man City and Chelsea, I think there’s a huge difference.</p>
      <p>"I think we need to recruit some players because we have the shortest squad right now, and I don’t know if we can get some other help from outside."</p>
