      <p>A first look at David Tennant in character as serial killer Dennis Nilsen reveals how scarily accurate new <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/true-crime-tv-series-docuseries-documentary/">true crime</a> series Des is about to be.</p>
      <p>With a deathly blank stare into the camera, the photo of Tennant in character is identical to the killer’s February 1983 mugshot, marking the end of his sickening reign as the Muswell Hill Murderer.</p>
      <p>With his hair slicked loosely over to one side and bottle top glasses, Tennant is seen looking down the barrel of a camera, completely expression-less.</p>
      <p>The new ITV series will take a deep dive into the horrid crimes of Nilsen, who was convicted of six murders and two attempted murders.</p>
      <p>His rampage, which spanned from 1978-1983, went largely undetected as he would lure men and young boys into his home before killing them.</p>
      <p>It was only when police officer DCI Peter Jay (to be played by Line Of Duty’s Daniel Mays) discovers human remains clogging the psycho’s drains that he was finally rumbled.</p>

      <p>While he was convicted of six murderers, mainly of homeless homosexual men, some believe the total could have been as high as 15.</p>

      <p>The series, Des, will be told through the eyes of the two men who encountered Nilsen as well as Nilsen himself.</p>
      <p>The Crown’s Jason Watkins will play the third man in question, playing biographer Brian Masters who got to know the killer.</p>
      <p>Nilsen spent the rest of his life in jail after being caught for his crimes, eventually <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/12/serial-killer-dennis-nilsen-dies-prison-aged-72-7541272/">dying in May 2018 at the age of 72</a>.</p>

      <p>Kim Varvell, Executive Producer for the new series, said of the show: ‘Dennis Nilsen’s crimes shocked the nation in the early 1980s. Our programme focuses on the emotional impact of those terrible crimes, both on those who came into contact with Nilsen himself, and also on the victims’ families’</p>
      <p>The series aims to highlight not only highlight the police investigation and trial, but also the media coverage on public perceptions of the victims, raising questions of just how far have we really come since then?</p>
