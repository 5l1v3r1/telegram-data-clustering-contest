      <h1>St Johnstone 1 Aberdeen 1 as Matty Kennedy salvages draw for nine-man Saints - 3 talking points</h1>
      <h2>It was a fiesty finish in Perth as Tommy Wright's men had two players sent off within the space of four minutes.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:03:54+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:03</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Matty Kennedy salvaged a point for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-johnstone-fc">St Johnstone</a> against Aberdeen in a frantic finish in Perth as the hosts finished with nine men.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sam-cosgrove">Sam Cosgrove</a> opened the scoring for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> in the first half before Kennedy sparked the game into life with an equaliser.</p>
      <p>It was a feisty conclusion as Tommy Wright's side had two players sent off within the space of four minutes as Murray Davidson and Callum Hendry were shown red.</p>
      <p>It was a dull start to the game and Cosgrove's classy strike was the only real moment of quality as he continued his fine start to the season, netting is 17th goal of the season.</p>
      <p>Moments later Curtis Main and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/niall-mcginn">Niall McGinn</a> somehow failed to double Aberdeen's lead.</p>
      <p>A dangerous cross was played in and it seemed like all Main had to do was head the ball into the empty net, but it somehow came off the back of his head as replays showed a Wallace Duffy handball had diverted it away from the striker.</p>

      <p>It then fell to McGinn who just had to put the ball on target and it was 2-0 but he skewed his shot wide.</p>
      <p>The Saints didn't threaten in the first half but came into the game after the break.</p>
      <p>Chances were few and far between but Kennedy put Tommy Wright's level after some brilliant link up play.</p>
      <p>The playmaker was put through on goal as he fired his strike past Joe Lewis.</p>
      <p>The game started to get tasty from that point on as both teams pushed for a winner.</p>
      <p>St Johnstone were shortly down to ten men after Davidson lunged in on Craig Bryson and was given his marching orders.</p>
      <p>Hendry was then guilty of an extremely late challenge on Lewis Ferguson as the Saints were reduced to nine men in the space of four minutes.</p>
      <p>Aberdeen then went in search for a winner with the advantage but spurned a number of chances as it finished all sqaure.</p>
      <h3>3 talking points</h3>
      <h4>Saints salvage point despite losing their cool</h4>

      <p>There wasn't much happening in the game until Kennedy equalised for the home side.</p>
      <p>A few meaty challenges certainly livened things up, but the two red cards were horrendous tackles as St Johnstone completely lost their cool.</p>
      <p>Kennedy's equaliser got them back in the game and who knows they could have went on to win it, but having two bodies less obviously handed the momentum back to Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>They managed to hold on for the point which is important in the grand scheme of things as they sit at the bottom of the table.</p>
      <p>But Wright will be disappointed the way his side lost their discipline when the game was there to be won, and it must be said they got away with one when Duffy's first-half handball went unpunished.</p>
      <h4>Where would Aberdeen be without Cosgrove?</h4>

      <p>Cosgrove was on target for Aberdeen once again and he's been invaluable to the Dons this season with 17 goals in 21 games.</p>
      <p>It's fair to assume that the Reds would not be sitting on 25 points as it stands - he has scored eight of his side's 15 goals in the league.</p>
      <p>It was another lovely finish and his general play was brilliant as his physicality was a handful for the Saints defence all afternoon.</p>
      <p>It's a worry for Aberdeen they are struggling to find goals from elsewhere but they won't be complaining about his recent form.</p>
      <p>An injury to the talisman and it's hard to see where Aberdeen could replace his production.</p>
      <h4>Considine reaches impressive milestone</h4>

      <p>There needs to be a special mention for Andrew Considine who made his 500th appearance for Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>The management team showed a real touch of class as they handed him the armband for the trip to Perth.</p>
      <p>Playing 500 times for any team is a remarkable achievement and a one-man club isn't something that happens especially in modern day football.</p>
      <p>Considine came through the Pittodrie youth ranks and has been with the club for over 20 years and his performance today epitomised the type of player he is.</p>
      <p>A no-nonsense defender puts his body on the line and even though he never got that coveted clean sheet, he'll be over the moon with his milestone.</p>
