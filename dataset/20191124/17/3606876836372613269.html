        <b>Goalkeeper Rune Jarstein was sent off as Hertha Berlin continued to sputter in the Bundesliga,  losing 4-0 at Augsburg on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hertha lost a fifth straight game and slid below Augsburg after Philipp Max, Sergio Cordova, Andre Hahn and Florian Niederlechner scored for the hosts. Hertha are just a point above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Left-back Max opened the scoring for the Bavarians in the 18th minute with a free-kick but the turning point came 10 minutes later.</p>
      <p>Jarstein earned a red card with a studs-up challenge on Niederlechner.  Cordova claimed the home side's second in the process.</p>
      <p>Substitute Hahn added a third in the 52nd minute with a superb curling strike from the edge of the box. Niederlechner bagged his side's fourth in the 79th minute.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Sunday, Borussia Dortmund's squad were booed and jeered when they appeared at the side's annual general meeting, with fans screaming "shame on you".</p>
      <p>Coach Lucien Favre is under pressure as Dortmund, expected to challenge for the title after an ambitious off-season recruitment drive, languish in sixth after a draw to lowly Paderborn on Friday.</p>
      <p>On Saturday managerless Bayern Munich closed the gap at the top of the table to just a point with a 4-0 romp at Fortuna Duesseldorf as leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach suffered a shock 2-0 loss at Union Berlin.</p>
      <p>In Sunday's late game, struggling Mainz head to Hoffenheim who can move fourth with a sixth straight win.</p>
