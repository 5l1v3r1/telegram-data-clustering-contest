      <h1>Eddie George Reacts To J.K. Dobbins Passing Him On All-Time List</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:11:32+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>It was a historic day for Ohio State running back J.K. Dobbins. On top of leading a rushing attack that mowed down the Penn State defense, he surpassed Buckeyes legend Eddie George on the school’s all-time rushing list.</p>
      <p>The former Heisman Trophy winner just so happened to be in attendance for the historic event. So naturally, George was asked what his thoughts were on being surpassed by Dobbins.</p>
      <p>In a very classy response, Georgie asserted that records were made to be broken. He said he was excited for Dobbins to pass him, much like he was when Ezekiel Elliott passed him a few years prior.</p>
      <p>George also said that he was excited about Dobbins’ future in football and beyond.</p>

      <p>The Ohio State running back had 36 carries for 157 yards and two touchdowns in a 28-7 win over the Nittany Lions. That win also propelled Ohio State into the Big Ten Championship Game.</p>
      <p>Dobbins now has 3,902 rushing yards in his career – behind only Ezekiel Elliott and Archie Griffin.</p>
      <p>He can surpass Ezekiel Elliott on the Ohio State all-time rushing list with just 60 yards over the next three or four games. But he’d need to stay in school for one more year to have a crack at Archie Griffin’s all-time mark of 5,589.</p>
      <p>Given how good he’s been for three years, it’s hard to imagine Dobbins waiting another year before going pro.</p>
