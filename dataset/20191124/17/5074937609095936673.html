      <p>Accra, Nov. 24, GNA - Mr Kaakyire Kwame Fosu, popularly known as KK Fosu, has said social media and the internet have made a major impact on the music industry and called highlife musicians to carefully blend their traditional styles with new and prevailing trends.</p>
      <p>“It was a challenge but now it is an advantage”, he said.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with Ghana News Agency, KK Fosu said foreign cultural and musical influences could be merged with what is currently prevailing in the country for all to enjoy and appreciate and this is what hiplife has sought to achieve over the years.</p>
      <p>KK Fosu said as a result of that effort, he has sold five albums and is currently signed up with ‘Worldmap Records’ owned by Frank Gogo.</p>
      <p>He said he would continue in his efforts to aid young and upcoming artistes as it is his goal to ensure that the youth would continue to appreciate our leaders in the highlife industry</p>
      <p>KK Fosu said in the past there used to be few radio stations but now they are all over and the onus now lies on the musician to capture the attention of the radio station by coming up with socially relevant and beautifully crafted themes in their repertoire.</p>
