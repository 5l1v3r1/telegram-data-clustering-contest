      <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says flu season is starting to ramp up â€” and it's not too late to reduce your risk with a vaccine.</p>
      <p>But scientists have come to realize that flu vaccines are less effective for people who are overweight or obese. Considering that excess weight affects <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/obesity_adult_15_16/obesity_adult_15_16.pdf">more than two-thirds </a>of the U.S. adult population, that's a significant shortcoming.</p>
      <p>Researchers are studying why that's the case, with an eye toward developing better flu vaccines.</p>
