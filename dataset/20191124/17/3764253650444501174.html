      </p>
      <p><i>“We also reject the proposed Kogi West senatorial rerun election, which has already been desecrated by the manipulations in the main election,”</i> the statement reads in part.</p>
      <p>The opposition party said since the figures in the main election are allegedly flawed, the proposed rerun cannot reflect the wishes of the electorate.</p>
      <p>The PDP added that its members are still grieving over the killings that greeted the November 16 elections.</p>
