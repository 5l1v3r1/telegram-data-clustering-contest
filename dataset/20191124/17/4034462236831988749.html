      <h2>But you better act fast.</h2>

      <p>Thanks to <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/over-570000-ford-models-have-a-serious-problem">quality control issues</a> that delayed dealership deliveries, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/explorer">2020 Ford Explorer</a> has had a rocky launch. As a result, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/2020-ford-explorer-sales-have-fallen-significantly">sales for the new Explorer have been very disappointing</a>, which may explain why the SUV is being offered with a significant discount this month.</p>
      <p>Initial discounts offered in September <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/fords-first-2020-explorer-discount-isnt-that-great">left a lot to be desired</a>, but according to <a href="http://fordauthority.com/2019/11/ford-discount-cuts-2020-explorer-pricing-by-5270-in-november-2019/">Ford Authority</a>, prices for the 2020 Ford Explorer are being slashed by up to $5,270 this month. It's worth noting that these deals vary by region, however.</p>

      <p>Regardless of the region, Ford is offering a $2,750 cash discount on the 2020 Explorer. New York customers can also take advantage of a $2,000 trade assist for these trims. If you buy with finance, Ford is offering 0.9-percent financing for 60 months plus a $1,500 cash and $2,000 trade assist discount.</p>
      <p>However, the biggest discount is being offered in Detroit, with a $2,750 cash discount and $2,520 trade assist for 2020 XLT models, giving a total discount of $5,270. Alternatively, the 2020 XLT and Limited models are available with 0.9 percent financing plus a $1,500 cash and $2,520 trade assist.</p>

      <p>In Miami and LA, the 2020 XLT and Limited models are available with a $2,750 cash discount plus a $1,000 trade assist or 0.9 percent finance plus $1,500 cash and $1,000 trade assist discounts. The offers in New York and Detroit are valid until December 2, so you better act fast. The discounts in Miami and LA, on the other hand, end on January 2 2020.</p>
      <p>With the maximum $5,270 discount, the 2020 Ford Explorer XLT's starting price is reduced from $38,515 down to $33,245. With the $4,750 discount available in New York, the Limited trim's starting price drops from $49,970 to $45,220. Hopefully, these discounts will help give the 2020 Ford Explorer a sales boost, as sales for the SUV were down by an alarming 48 percent in Q3 2019.</p>
