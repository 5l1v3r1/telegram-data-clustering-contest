      <p>K-pop star and TV celebrity Goo Hara was found dead at her home in Seoul on Sunday, police in South Korea said.</p>
      <p>Police said an acquaintance found the 28-year-old dead at her home in southern Seoul and reported it to authorities.</p>
      <p>The cause of death was not immediately known. Police refused to provide further details.</p>
      <p>Ms Hara made her debut in 2008 as a member of the girl group Kara, which had big followings in South Korea, Japan and other Asian countries.</p>
      <p>She later worked as a solo artist and appeared on many TV shows.</p>
      <p>In May, she was reportedly found unconscious at her home and was taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>She was embroiled last year in public disputes with an ex-boyfriend who claimed to have been assaulted by her.</p>
      <p>Ms Hara accused the man of having threatened to circulate a sex video of her. The case made her the subject of tabloid fodder and malicious online messages.</p>
      <p>In October, another K-pop star and actress, Sulli, was found dead at her home near Seoul.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old was known for her feminist voice and outspokenness that was rare among female entertainers in deeply conservative South Korea.</p>
      <p>Before her death, she appeared in a TV show and spoke out against the online backlash she received over her lifestyle.</p>
