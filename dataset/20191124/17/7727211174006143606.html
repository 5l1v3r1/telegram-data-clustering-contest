      <p>An 18-year-old boy who tragically died in a car crash is now a "guardian angel" after saving the lives of three people through organ donation.</p>
      <p>Heartbreaking tributes were paid to "amazing" Luke Peaurt-Moran, from <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/sefton">Sefton</a> , who died after a crash on Moss Lane, in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/burscough">Burscough</a> , on November 20.</p>
      <p>He is understood to have been a passenger in a white Audi A1 which flipped on to its roof in the crash.</p>
      <p>On a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/7xm326-luke-moran039s-funeral">gofundme page</a> a family member of Luke's, Donna Peaurt, wrote how "no mother should have to experience the tragic loss of their child dying."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/7xm326-luke-moran039s-funeral">gofundme</a> page reads: "We lost Luke to a head trauma which was the result of a car accident which he was sadly unable to recover from.</p>

      <p>"Words cannot describe what exactly losing our lovely Luke feels like, it's been an extremely difficult and a heartbreaking past couple of days for both family and friends alike and especially for his mother, brothers, sister and girlfriend.</p>
      <p>"He was a cheeky lad, a loveable rogue, who could light up the sky with his smile and just had such an amazing personality and we will miss him dearly and never forget just how much he meant to all of us.</p>
      <p>"Luke was just 18 years old and left us far too soon, no mother should ever have to experience such a tragic loss especially at such a young time in his life."</p>
      <p>Lancashire Police confirmed the car involved in the crash was stolen.</p>
      <p>The driver of the car, Conner Stevens, 24, from Sefton, died at the scene.</p>

      <p>On the gofundme page Luke's family said he had gone on to save the lives of others after donating his organs and will now "live on in our hearts and souls, and also in the people who will be receiving his organs."</p>
      <p>Ms Peart wrote: "Lukes organ donation has already saved the lives of three people which is absolutely amazing and he would have been very happy for them, he might not have been a complete angel but to those families, he has been their guardian angel and I'm sure he will be looking down on them throughout their lives."</p>
      <p>Luke's family are now trying to raise funds for his funeral.</p>
