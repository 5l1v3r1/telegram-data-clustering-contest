      <h1>Bristol City's January 2019 'transfer targets': Where they are now and if Robins did right</h1>
      <h2>A look back at who the Robins were linked with a year ago.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:14:48+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:14</time> by <a rel="author">James Bishop</a></address>
      <p>As the infamous January transfer window is fast approaching, names plucked from nowhere will be linked with every Championship club and doing the rounds. </p>
      <p>So who was linked with the Robins this time last year, and where are they now?</p>
      <p>We look back at the players reported to have been on the radar of Bristol City a year ago and examine if the club did the right thing in not pursuing a deal, or whether it may be a case of 'What-if?' for the West Country side.</p>
      <p>It was mainly strikers being looked at at the beginning of this calendar year and it could be a similar story in the next transfer window.</p>
      <h3>Scott Hogan</h3>

      <p>If you’re a club in the Championship, you will have definitely been linked with Scott Hogan.  The former Brentford man was struggling at Aston Villa last January, having only scored just 7 goals in 56 games for the now Premier League side, having signed for them for £9m in 2017.</p>
      <p>Villa allowed Hogan to speak to other clubs in the hope of securing a loan deal, and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villas-forgotten-striker-linked-16450761">the two sides interested were City and Sheffield United</a>. Not every City fan was happy about the potential signing, however everyone was desperate to sign a striker in order to help the side's promotion push. </p>
      <p>However, a move between the two was unlikely given his wages and playing attributes, with Johnson preferring a more physical presence up front.</p>
      <p>Hogan eventually signed for Sheffield United on loan till the end of the season and ironically scored against Lee Johnson's men in a 3-2 defeat and helped the Blades to promotion by scoring twice in 8 matches.</p>
      <p>When the summer transfer window opened, Hogan was linked to City again, but he eventually moved to Stoke City having signed another loan deal in the summer and has scored 3 goals in 10 games so far this season.</p>
      <p>In hindsight, perhaps City did for the best in not bringing in Hogan.</p>
      <h3>Leon Clarke</h3>

      <p>Leon Clarke was just another one of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/bristol-city-chase-leon-clarke-2475806">the large pool of strikers Lee Johnson was reportedly after</a>. The Sheffield United man was pushed down the pecking order this time last year despite having a high goal-scoring season the year previous.</p>
      <p>With Gary Madine, Conor Washington, Billy Sharp and David McGoldrick in front of the former Wolverhampton Wanderers forward, Blades manager Chris Wilder said he was open to a sale.</p>
      <p>However, wages proved to the main problem again, as there was the competition with other Championship clubs and Bristol City don't pay the biggest wages - as confirmed at the time by Lee Johnson.  "I don't know if we'll be able to do that [bring in a striker] because it's very, very expensive in this league now and we're not the biggest payers," said Johnson.</p>
      <p>Secondly, the Robins' senior hierarchy is not usually keen on signing players with no sell-on value.</p>
      <p>So a move between the two never came through with Clarke staying on at Sheffield United and winning promotion. The 34-year-old is back in the Championship having signed for Wigan and has scored 3 goals in his first 15 appearances.</p>
      <p>Another forward who the Robins may now look back on and see that things panned out for the best.</p>
      <h3>Britt Assombalonga</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>This man might be described as a journalist's dream. The Middlesbrough forward has been linked with just about every club in the Championship (much like Hogan).</p>
      <p>And towards the end of the last January window, the powerful striker <a href="https://talksport.com/football/efl/485562/bristol-city-middlesbrough-britt-assombalonga/">was being heavily linked with the Robins</a>. Back then, wages and the transfer fee proved too big a problem for City as Assombalonga was reported to be on big money at the Riverside. A deal proved unobtainable.</p>
      <p>So far this season in 16 games the former Forest man has scored six goals with Boro sitting just outside the relegation zone. Could yet be a future transfer target.</p>
      <h3>Kieffer Moore</h3>

      <p>Lee Johnson really wanted to sign a striker last January window and maybe this is one that got away. He was one of the star men for Barnsley last year having scored 17 goals in their promotion campaign and was named in the PFA team of the year for League 1.</p>
      <p>There were strong talks reported between the two parties last January but nothing materialised, as Barnsley were unwilling to sell someone so key to their promotion push. The Robins <a href="https://twitter.com/reluctantnicko/status/1127500558900895745?s=20">were strongly linked again</a> at the beginning of the summer.</p>
      <p>Moore is now playing for Wigan having signed for them in the summer but has struggled for form and only scored his first goal for the club at the beginning of November.</p>
