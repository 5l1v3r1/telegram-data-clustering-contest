                <p>A comprehensive victory against Brighton before the break led many to believe that the side could turn their fortunes around. However, United have played their game to the same old script with yet another miserable performance on the road.</p>
                <h3>Phil Jones blunder costs Manchester United as Sheffield United score</h3>
                <p>With United employing a 5-2-3 formation, United made up for their midfield deficiency by adding another centre back to their line-up. Surprisingly, Phil Jones was handed his first Premier League start of the season and soon enough, the centre back left his manager ruing his decision to play the 27-year old.</p>

                      <p>Jones had been clumsy all through the match, however, his inefficiency at the back finally cost his side when Lys Mousset floored him during their one on one to set up John Lundstram. The midfielder had his shot blocked by David De Gea. However, the ball found John Fleck, who placed the ball behind the net.</p>

                            <p>At the time of writing, United trail the match 2-0 after Lys Moussets added yet another goal to add to United’s misery. There is still more than half an hour left in the match. But at no point in this match have United looked to assert themselves.</p>
                            <p>The visitors have only managed two shots and only one on target in comparison to the Blades who have had 8 shots in total and 6 of them on target.</p>
