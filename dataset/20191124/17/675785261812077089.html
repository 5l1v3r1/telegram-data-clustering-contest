      <h2>Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says the Tory manifesto showed the Conservatives are a party of no-hopers promising five more years of the same. Where is the solution for social care and Universal Credit?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:13:41+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:13</time> by <a rel="author">John McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jMcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>You can see now why Boris Johnson pulled out of facing Jeremy Corbyn in another debate.</p>
      <p>There’s no way his bluster and posh boy antics would have dug him out of the hole the Tory no-hope manifesto has dug him into.</p>
      <p>There can’t be any doubt now that the Conservatives have completely run out of ideas.</p>
      <p>There’s no recognition of what they’ve put this country through for nearly a decade.</p>
      <p>If the Conservatives win they’re now promising five more years of the same.</p>
      <p>There’s nothing about preparing for the future, tackling the climate and environmental emergency with the urgency it needs.</p>

      <p>No new money for care for older people, despite all the promises.</p>
      <p>Nothing more for our schools, after years of cuts.</p>
      <p>Nothing for the public sector workers after years of pay rises below inflation.</p>
      <p>Nothing to stop the brutal roll-out of Universal Credit.</p>
      <p>And – of course – a Brexit deal that would serve up our NHS as a Christmas present for American health corporations.</p>

      <p>It couldn’t be further from Labour’s manifesto last week, which was full of ideas to turn the economy and the country round.</p>
      <p>We’ll get big oil companies to pay for the retraining and well-paid jobs that workers in those industries will need.</p>
      <p>We’ll deliver free personal care for everyone over 65 who needs it.</p>
      <p>We’ll deliver justice for the women who lost out when the Tories and Liberals took their pensions.</p>

      <p>We’ll pay £26billion into the NHS and £25billion more for schools, while the Tories will never sort out our public services or create the well-paid jobs we need because they won’t take on the super rich and tax dodgers.</p>
      <p>They hope we’re all stupid, thinking just about Brexit, not the next five years.</p>
      <p>The people of Britain deserve more than the Tories' negative campaigning and vacuous political slogans.</p>
      <p>The choice couldn’t be clearer: real change with Labour, or more of the same grim Conservative cuts.</p>
