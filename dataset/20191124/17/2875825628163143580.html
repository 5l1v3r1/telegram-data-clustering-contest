      <h1>Thousands of banned drivers could still be on roads as just 13% disqualified in 2019 have surrendered licences</h1>
      <h2>The rate is the lowest in five years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:10:01+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:10</time> by <a rel="author">Sean McCarthaigh</a></address>
      <p>Thousands of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/driving-ban">banned drivers</a> could be still on the road after failing to surrender their licences.</p>
      <p>Just 1,257 <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/motoring">motorists</a> out of 9,656 banned by the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/courts">courts</a> or who have exceeded the maximum level of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/penalty-points">penalty points</a> have handed them in.</p>
      <p>The rate of 13%, which includes figures up to November 15, is the lowest in five years.</p>
      <p>PARC <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/road-safety">road safety</a> group chairperson Susan Gray said: “More and more people are taking the chance of not handing back their licence.</p>
      <p>“You can be guaranteed a lot of them are not doing so because they want to be able to continue to drive.</p>
      <p>“If there was a proper system in place there would not be a problem.</p>
      <p>“The problem is getting worse and the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/road-safety-authority">Road Safety Authority</a> and other authorities don’t seem to be doing anything about it.”</p>
      <p>The statistics, provided by <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/transport">Transport</a> Minister <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/shane-ross">Shane Ross</a>, show more than 4,000 of those disqualified – 42% of all motorists banned – have failed to respond to notices seeking the return of their licence.</p>
      <p>Almost 4,400 other disqualified drivers had no valid Irish licence to surrender as they either did not possess one, it had expired or it was foreign.</p>
      <p>PARC claimed there is a breakdown between the RSA, Department of Transport, Courts Service and Garda in ensuring details of all banned motorists are recorded and enforced.</p>
      <p>Failure to surrender a licence carries a maximum fine of €1,000 on first conviction and up to €2,000 on a second or further offence.</p>
      <p>The penalty for driving while disqualified is a fine of up to €5,000 and/or six months in prison.</p>
      <p>RSA chief Moyagh Murdock said the figures were “entirely unacceptable”.</p>
