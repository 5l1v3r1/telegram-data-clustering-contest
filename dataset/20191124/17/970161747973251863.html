      <p>Two sheep and three cattle have been stabbed to death and sprayed with pentagrams, sparking fears of a Satanic-style cult.</p>
      <p>The animals were found dead in and around Hampshire’s New Forest National Park over the space of just five days.</p>
      <p>Police also received reports of a cow being injured, while a church was covered in Satanic graffiti, including the numbers 666 sprayed on the door.</p>
      <p>They are now investigating the ‘unusual’ incidents, three of which took place in the village of Bramshaw.</p>
      <p>One of the sheep was found by resident Judy Rudd, who had been walking her two dogs through the village at the time.</p>

      <p>She said: ‘It had purple and green aerosol symbols sprayed on it. It was a pentagram and a cross. It had been stabbed to death.</p>

      <p>‘The wounds were in the side of the body by the rib cage. It was very unpleasant. Some people think it’s sinister.’</p>
      <p>Judy’s husband Julian said it was ‘reasonable’ to suggest the sheep weren’t killed by ‘lads messing about’, adding that the sheep’s owner had been ‘very cut up about it and very worried’.</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘There’s a certain amount of concern, it’s unnerving – we’ve lived here 40 years and there’s been nothing like this before.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t agree that it’s done to shock – you don’t go around knifing animals simply to shock people.</p>
      <p>‘It’s related to something other than simply a desire to injure animals. It’s either witchcraft or whatever. It’s rather worrying.’</p>
      <p>A farmer who owned the injured cow said he believed the attacks were being carried out by more than one person.</p>

      <p>While Reverend David Bacon, of the part-12th Century St Peter’s Church, in Bramshaw, suggested the killings could be a part of ‘witchcraft’ or ‘black magic’ in the area.</p>
      <p>An inverted cross and the number 666 was written on the church’s door.</p>
      <p>Rev Bacon said: ‘I’ve been told one of the symbols was a 666 which of course is a biblical sign of the devil, or Satan, so it could have [sinister overtones].</p>
      <p>‘I’ve been here 15 years and seen a lot of stuff, but nothing like this. It could just be kids, but I don’t think it is, given the context.</p>

      <p>‘There’s been witchcraft round here for hundreds of years – the New Forest is well known for witchcraft and black magic happening, and this has obviously gone up a level.’</p>
      <p>An elderly resident who lives close to the church said the killings were ‘wicked’ and ‘outrageous’, adding: ‘I have no idea who would be capable of letting a sheep bleed to death.’</p>
      <p>Sergeant Andy Williams, of Hampshire Constabulary’s Country Watch team, is now investigating the cases to see if they are linked.</p>
      <p>Describing the incidents as ‘unusual’, he urged anyone who uses the Forest to be ‘vigilant’ and report anything suspicious to police.</p>
