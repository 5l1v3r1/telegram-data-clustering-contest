      <p>Gloucester fell just short of what would have been a memorable win to lose 30-27 to 14-man <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/montpellier">Montpellier</a> in a thrilling Heineken Champions Cup clash at Altrad Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Cherry and Whites were beaten at home by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse">Toulouse</a> in round one and despite an entertaining performance and tries from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/callum-braley/">Callum Braley</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/matt-banahan/">Matt Banahan</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/joe-simpson/">Joe Simpson</a>, failed to make the most of a second-half red card for Montpellier lock Jacques du Plessis.</p>
      <p>The French team’s efforts came from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/montpellier/players/jan-serfontein/">Jan Serfontein</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/reds/players/caleb-timu/">Caleb Timu</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/montpellier/players/nemani-nadolo/">Nemani Nadolo</a>, while <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/montpellier/players/benoit-paillaugue/">Benoit Paillaugue</a> kicked 15 points as they defied the loss of Du Plessis to bounce back from a loss to Connacht.</p>
      <p>Gloucester took home a losing bonus point, but it could have been so much more.</p>
      <p>The visitors were forced into a late change with Banahan replacing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/jason-woodward/">Jason Woodward</a> at full-back due to a groin injury, in what was a second string Cherry and White outfit.</p>

      <p>Visiting centre <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/billy-twelvetrees/">Billy Twelvetrees</a> had a nightmare start with two early spills in a scrappy, fast-paced opening before Paillaugue’s penalty got the scoreboard moving.</p>
      <p>Montpellier moved further clear with a 22nd minute try from Serfontein after he collected Yvan Reilhac’s kick ahead to score. The try was given by the TMO and Paillaugue converted.</p>
      <p>Gloucester were keen to run the ball on every occasion and fly-half <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/lloyd-evans/">Lloyd Evans</a> made a fine break down the centre which ended with Twelvetrees kicking a simple penalty.</p>
      <p>Montpellier’s giant forwards were dominant at the scrum but <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester">Gloucester</a> had themselves to blame as they tried to run clear – only to make mistakes.</p>

      <p>It gave the French side the platform from which number eight Timu crashed over from a scrum into which Gloucester had the put-in. Paillaugue improved the effort.</p>
      <p>Evans made a second great break and passed inside to half-back partner Braley, who dived for the line to give Gloucester a lifeline. Twelvetrees’ kick was successful.</p>
      <p>Wing Nadolo had a try ruled out for an earlier knock-on after he crashed onto the ball on an unstoppable line but Montpellier still had the advantage and opted for a scrum.</p>
      <p>After a series of set-pieces, Nadolo powered over again and this time the score was given.</p>

      <p>Paillaugue converted in the 47th minute of the first half to make it 24-10 at the break.</p>
      <p>Gloucester’s second half started with a bang as Banahan crashed over following some fine phase play and Twelvetrees narrowed the deficit further before Paillaugue kicked a penalty.</p>
      <p>The momentum of the game then changed even further when Montpellier lock Du Plessis needlessly elbowed <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/gerbrandt-grobler/">Gerbrandt Grobler</a> in the head in a maul and was rightly sent off, giving Gloucester a man advantage for the final 24 minutes.</p>
      <p>Twelvetrees exchanged penalties with Paillaugue as both teams unloaded their benches and with five minutes to go Gloucester went the length of the field via two clever kicks.</p>
      <p>Replacement scrum-half Simpson was the one to dive over. Evans took over the kicking duties after Twelvetrees substitution and nailed the conversion – but Montpellier held on.</p>
      <p>– PA</p>
