      <p>Someone had a piece of advice for Jordyn: ‘here’s a tip. If you do brows after moisturizer it helps to dust a bit of translucent powder over your brows so the product doesn’t slip and slide and actually sticks.’</p>
      <p>Another follower said: ‘I’m flying over there! Ever since I have seen your face on Red Table Talk, I just had to know how you did it so flawless.’</p>
      <p>One other commenter said: ‘I don’t wear makeup but perhaps I might because I support you pretty lady.😊❤️’</p>
      <p>A follower gushed over Jordyn and told her: ‘Omg loved your video 😍😍🔥and your makeup turned out amazing you should definitely do more tutorials ❤️❤️❤️’</p>
