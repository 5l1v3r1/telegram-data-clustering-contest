      <h1>'Agenda-driven narrative’: Former Fox host bashes network over impeachment coverage</h1>

      <p>Former Fox News host Juliet Huddy claimed that her ex-network is peddling lies about the impeachment hearings to push a political agenda.</p>
      <p>Huddy, who currently hosts the radio show <i>Juliet and Curtis</i> for WABC, bashed Fox News’s coverage of impeachment during a Sunday interview with CNN's <i>Reliable Sources</i>. She agreed with host Brian Stelter that Fox News was hiding “damning evidence” from the impeachment hearings to “present another set of facts” about President Trump’s conduct.</p>
      <p>“Fox is banking on the fact that Americans are going to — Americans who watch them — their viewers are going to stick with them,” Huddy said.</p>
      <p>She explained that only 20% of Americans “closely followed” the impeachment hearings that took place over the past few weeks. Huddy claimed the rest of America gets their impeachment news from headlines, adding that she has relatives who are Trump supporters who only get their news from Breitbart headlines and Fox News’s television lineup.</p>
      <p>“I look at their computer screens, it’s Breitbart or <i>The Hill </i>so, the headlines and the information that they’re getting is curated by a very specific agenda-driven narrative, and that is the Right,” Huddy stated. “So, they’re not getting any of this information.”</p>
      <p>She added, “Fox is banking on the fact, as is Hannity to Tucker Carlson and the rest of the crew, the <i>Fox &amp; Friends</i> folk, they’re banking on the fact that they’ve done a good job of convincing us, the rest of the world, and their viewers, that the media is lying, that critics of Donald Trump are liars and are the enemy of the state. They’re banking on the fact that everyone is going to stick with them and not go outside the lines.”</p>

      <p>Fox News, especially host Chris Wallace, offered <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/chris-wallace-trump-impeachment-testimony-would-be-akin-to-prince-andrew-testifying-on-epstein">several harsh criticisms</a></u> of Trump’s conduct in their impeachment coverage despite Huddy’s claims that the network didn’t air that information. Trump himself even <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/airtime-for-losers-trump-attacks-foxs-shannon-bream-over-swalwell-interview">criticized the network</a></u> for their impeachment coverage and for inviting guests like California Rep. Eric Swalwell on their programming.</p>
      <p>Huddy, 50, was with Fox News from 1998 to 2016, where she frequently guest-hosted <i>Fox &amp; Friends</i>, among other programs. In 2017, she <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/ex-fox-news-employee-claims-trump-tried-to-kiss-her-in-elevator">settled a lawsuit</a></u> against former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly after alleging that he sexually harassed her. Huddy has also accused Trump of forcibly kissing her in an elevator.</p>
