      <p>SHREVEPORT, La. -- A bank robber received a lot of attention following a clumsy escape from his heist in Louisiana.</p>
      <p>The local sheriff's office shared surveillance footage of the criminal getting away after he allegedly robbed a credit union in Shreveport - but not before tripping multiple times along the way.</p>
      <p>The man was shown falling three times before he reached his getaway car and took off.</p>
      <p>Some locals who watched the footage were in disbelief that the alleged robber got away.</p>
      <p>"He's a lucky man because all you got to do is fall once. At least that's the way it is in the movies," said one resident.</p>
      <p>The suspect has not been identified.</p>
