      <p>ESPN recently put out an infographic detailing possible options for big money fights in 2020 involving fighters such as Conor McGregor, Jorge Masvidal, Khabib Nurmagomedov, Tony Ferguson, Kamaru Usman and others. The former two-division champion responded on social media to claim that he is willing to fight anyone on that list.</p>

      <p>Masvidal then responded to McGregor’s statement.</p>
      <p>“Put your money where your mouth is,” Masvidal wrote. “I’m the only 1.”</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first exchange the pair has had on social media, with <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/6/20951073/zahabi-everybody-knows-what-conor-mcgregor-does-it-would-be-the-jorge-masvidal-show-after-two-rounds">McGregor recently asking for a “three piece and a soda” </a>and Masvidal simply dismissing the “little dude’s” chances.</p>
      <p>Dana White also initially<a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/7/17/20698209/dana-white-shuts-down-jorge-masvidal-vs-conor-mcgregor-welterweight-kamaru-usman-ufc-mma-news"> shut down the idea of a possible match up</a>, saying Masvidal is “too big for Conor.” Firas Zahabi also gave his analysis about the potential bout, and somewhat agrees with the UFC President. According to the renowned coach, while McGregor may be the best puncher in the UFC,<a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/6/20951073/zahabi-everybody-knows-what-conor-mcgregor-does-it-would-be-the-jorge-masvidal-show-after-two-rounds"> everyone now knows what he will do and it will be “the Masvidal show” after two</a> rounds.</p>
