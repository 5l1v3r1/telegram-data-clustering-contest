      <p>#CongratulationsDoc is currently trending on Twitter as Nigerians “tap into the blessing” of one Dr. Harvey Olufunmilayo who tweeted photos of his newly acquired house in the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>Olufunmilayo, who tweets via @DrOlufunmilayo had tweeted on Sunday:</p>

      <p>Although @DrOlufunmilayo’s Twitter handle has no photograph, Olufunmilayo tweeted what is believed to be his own photograph in his new house, alongside a man who appears to share the moment with him.</p>
      <p>As his teeming followers congratulate him and tap into his blessing, someone expresses doubt about the possibility of the achievement between 2016 when he landed in the UK and now — a period spanning three years.</p>
      <p>One Usman @usmee queries: “Congratulations Doc. Please also explain to your followers how you worked hard. I’m sure a lot of them may think it’s pretty much easy to acquire such within that short period. Some doctors have been there for over 5 years &amp; are still trying to make ends meet.”</p>
      <p>Olufunmilayo responds:<br/>Thanks Usman.<br/>1. I’m not married.<br/>2. People’s responsibilities differ.<br/>3. I’ve had a culture of saving between 500-1000£ every month from my earnings for about 3years.<br/>4. It was a plan I had and worked towards seeing friends who achieved same.<br/>That’s the simplified explanation.</p>
