      <p>The smoke cleared as rescue workers carried bodies in stretchers and hundreds gathered at the scene.</p>
      <p>Placide Kambale, a local pilot, said he took a taxi to the scene of the crash to help out. When he got there, the plane was on fire.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I called other young people from the neighborhood. They helped me to try to remove those who still moved.</p>
      <p>‘We have managed to recover two that was quickly sent to the hospital.’</p>

      <p>Joseph Makundi, coordinator of the North-Kivu civil protection, said that at least 25 people had been killed.</p>
      <p>The Dornier 228-200 was owned by private carrier Busy Bee and was headed to Beni, about 220 miles north of Goma in the same province.</p>
      <p>The UN mission in Congo said it sent an Emergency Crash and Rescue team with two fire engines to support Congolese authorities.</p>
      <p>None of Congo’s commercial carriers, including Busy Bee, are allowed to fly into European Union airspace because of safety concerns.</p>
