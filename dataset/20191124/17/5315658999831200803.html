      <p>Minister of Foreign Affairs to visit the United Arab Emirates</p>
      <p>Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters will travel on Tuesday to the United Arab Emirates, one of New Zealand’s most important partners in the Middle East.</p>
      <p>“New Zealand enjoys a dynamic and wide-ranging relationship with the UAE. The UAE is an important partner for New Zealand in the Gulf region, our 10th largest trading partner and a hub for air links and trade with Europe and the wider region,” Mr Peters said.</p>
      <p>“The UAE was also a strong supporter of New Zealand in the aftermath of the terrorist attack in Christchurch.”</p>
      <p>While in the UAE Mr Peters will meet with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, His Highness Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan.</p>
      <p>“This visit is an opportunity to deepen our extensive cooperation, particularly in the areas of trade, development and security; to exchange views on the political and security situation in the Middle East; and to share New Zealand’s insights into Pacific issues.”</p>
      <p>Mr Peters will also meet with His Highness Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman of the Expo Dubai 2020 Higher Committee, and visit the New Zealand Pavilion construction site.</p>
      <p>“New Zealand’s participation in Expo 2020 is an unparalleled opportunity to highlight and promote New Zealand globally as an innovative, knowledge-led economy,” Mr Peters said.</p>
      <p>Mr Peters will be travelling 26-30 November.</p>
