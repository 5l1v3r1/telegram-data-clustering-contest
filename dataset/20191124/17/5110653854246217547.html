      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:40:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:40</time> by <a rel="author">Tadd Haislop</a></address>
      <p>The NFL coverage map for Week 12makes clear what CBS and Fox considerthe best games <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-schedule-week-12-games-today-tv-channels-times-scores/gxmnxkzzjcap1ay36iwj8ukpw">Sunday's NFL TV schedule</a> has to offer. That's especially the case this week.</p>
      <p>In a rare occurrence, one of the regional Fox broadcasts in Week 12 has become a national broadcast. The entire country will see Cowboys vs. Patriots at 4:25 p.m. ET on Fox thanks to the NFL flexing Packers vs. 49ers to Sunday night.</p>
      <p>As for Fox's early Sunday afternoon games, the majority of the country will get Seahawks vs. Eagles, the game that was flexed into the 1 p.m. ET window when Packers-49ers was moved. On CBS, most markets will be presented Saints vs. Panthers, with a handful of others getting Raiders vs. Jets, Steelers vs. Bengals, Broncos vs. Bills or Jaguars vs. Titans, instead.</p>
      <p>Below are the full NFL coverage maps for Week 12, plus a list of major TV markets and the CBS and Fox games that will be presented in each on Sunday.</p>
