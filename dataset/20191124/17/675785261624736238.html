      <h1>Family furious at man living in parked van outside their home for two years</h1>
      <h2>Andy Calvert has been in a dispute with Cameron Weir and his mum Sheila in Stonehouse, Lanarkshire, for more than two years but now the relatives have shared their anger</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:36:04+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:36</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, Jennifer Hyland, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A fed-up family have told of their fury at being unable to move a man living in a parked van outside their <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/housing">home</a> for the last two years.</p>
      <p>Andy Calvert, 58, has refused to move from the same spot despite multiple complaints made by Cameron Weir and mum Sheila since around May 2017.</p>
      <p>The couple claim a wood burner used by Andy causes fumes to pour into their house and back garden in Stonehouse, Lanarkshire.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/raging-neighbours-call-scots-council-20943774">Daily Record</a> today reports authorities appear powerless to intervene.</p>
      <p>"We live in a quiet residential area and this really is making our life hell," Cameron, 45, said.</p>
      <p>"In summer, we can’t even enjoy sitting in our back garden because of the fumes from the vehicles and the stove.</p>

      <p>"It’s really noisy because when he works on his two cars and motorbike, he revs the engines.</p>
      <p>"He also has a number of people visiting and they are so loud that we can’t hear our TV in our living room. It’s a nightmare."</p>
      <p>Christina McKelvie, who is Member of Scottish Parliament, contacted South Lanarkshire Council on Cameron's behalf. However, it is understood because the van sits on an unadopted road, the council has no authority to move the vehicle.</p>

      <p>When approached by the Sunday Mail, Andy blamed the council for his housing issues.</p>
      <p>He said: "The council evicted me from my flat because I fell behind on rent. I had nowhere to go but my van.</p>
      <p>"It was -6C that night and I had to kick the door open as it had frozen shut. Now they want me to declare myself homeless but I have somewhere to live. They made me homeless so, until they admit that, I’m not moving."</p>

      <p>Andy, who is a long-distance lorry driver, has kitted out his van with a double bed, a TV, a fridge, and wood panelling for insulation. He uses a gas ring to cook, has a chemical toilet and showers at work.</p>
      <p>He bough the wood burner for £50 on eBay.</p>
      <p>The van also uses batteries for power and has two gas canisters and solar panels.</p>
      <p>Despite sympathising with Cameron and Sheila, Andy is refusing to move.</p>

      <p>"I’ve nothing against them. They have a nice fancy house and don’t want a hobo at their back door. But I’m not breaking any laws. It’s my choice and a matter of principle," the driver said.</p>
      <p>South Lanarkshire Council’s executive director of housing Daniel Lowe said: “The council is aware of the concerns raised by Mr Weir and his mother and has kept them fully updated on our position in relation to this matter.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, at this juncture, the council does not have sufficient evidence to raise a court action for unlawful encampment but is continuing to monitor this situation closely on an ongoing basis and is keeping this matter under review."</p>
