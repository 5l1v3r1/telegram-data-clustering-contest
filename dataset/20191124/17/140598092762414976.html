      <h1>Mary Beard relies on her husband to do household chores, as she reveals her 100 hour week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:32:00+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/camilla-turner/" target="_blank">Camilla Turner</a></address>
      <p>Professor Mary Beard has said that she relies on her “retired husband” to do household chores, as she reveals her 100 hour working week ahead of a lecturers’ strike.</p>
      <p>The renowned Cambridge classicist told how on a typical day she starts work at six o’clock in the morning and works continuously until around 11 o’clock at night with no lunch break. </p>
      <p>She said she has spent the past few weeks calculating how many hours per week she spends working and her current estimate is “over 100”.</p>
      <p>Writing on Twitter, she said: “There are grey areas... how do you calculate the travel time to get to an outside lecture? Yep, I outsource cleaning, I confess. My retired husband does the shopping and 'maintenance'. I make the cakes once a year.”  </p>
      <p>She added that she “certainly” does not have weekends off, and only “occasionally” goes out for dinner.</p>
      <p> Prof Beard, 64,  was speaking ahead of an eight day walk-out by university employees due to begin on Monday at institutions across the country amid a row over pay and pensions.</p>
      <p>Over a million students face disruption to their studies as academics from 60 universities voted in favour of industrial action.  </p>
      <p>Members of the University and College Union (UCU) held two separate ballots last month, one over pensions and another over their pay and working conditions.</p>
      <p>The union is locked in a battle with Universities UK (UUK), which represents vice-Chancellors, over proposed pension reforms to address a reported deficit and rising benefit costs.</p>
      <p>The current dispute is over UCU members being forced to make increased contributions to maintain the same level of benefits.</p>
      <p>Employees are now paying in 9.6 per cent of their salary to the scheme rather than the 8 per cent they paid last year.</p>
      <p>Prof Beard, who is a fellow at Newnham College, Cambridge University, acknowledged that she is “well remunerated” for her “heavy load” of work.  She confirmed that she will “not be crossing a picket line” during the strike.  </p>
