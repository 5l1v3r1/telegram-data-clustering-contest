      <p>Her friend, Teadra Morris, who is a second-time attendee, said she was also impressed by the party’s focus on youth. </p>
      <p>"Definitely what differentiates us from the other party is how we involve youth in the process - in the political process. The recommendations that youth give, we consider it when making policies and laws and amendments to laws."</p>
      <p>Travelling to Kingston from Ocho Rios this morning, Micarlos Walker, 21, said that he came because he too believes the party is doing a good job for youths.</p>
