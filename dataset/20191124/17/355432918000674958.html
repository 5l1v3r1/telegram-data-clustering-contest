      <h1>Trump retweets award for Doral resort: 'Too bad we didn't have the G-7 here'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:06:06+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:06</time> by <a rel="author">Justine Coleman</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> retweeted an announcement that his Doral resort received an award, saying it was “Too bad we didn’t have” the Group of Seven (G-7) summit at the Florida location.</p>
      <p>The Trump Golf account posted that the resort received the Resort of the Week award from GOLF.com. The president called Doral the “Best location” for the summit and pushed back on accusations he would have gained financially from hosting the gathering of world leaders.</p>
      <p>“Too bad we didn’t have the G-7 here,” Trump tweeted. “I offered to pick up the entire cost, would have saved at least $35,000,000 for the USA. Best location. Very stupid people thought I would gain. Wrong! Looking at Camp David. Will announce soon.”</p>

      <p>The Trump National Doral Miami <a href="https://www.golf.com/travel/2019/11/19/top-100-resort-week-trump-national-doral-miami/">received</a> the award Nov. 19 because of the “Blue Monster” centerpiece of the courses and the additional amenities, including the restaurants, spa and pool.</p>
      <p>The administration announced plans to host the international summit at the president’s resort last month, which provoked backlash from Democrats and ethics watchdog groups. </p>
      <p>Acting chief of staff <a href="https://thehill.com/people/mick-mulvaney">Mick Mulvaney</a> <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/466292-trumps-doral-resort-to-host-g-7-summit-next-year">defended</a> the decision in a rare press conference, saying the president suggested the resort be added the list of locations being considered for the June G-7 meeting.</p>
      <p>The president <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/466607-trump-says-his-doral-resort-will-no-longer-host-g-7-after-backlash">reversed</a> his decision to host the G-7 at the Doral resort a few days later. </p>
