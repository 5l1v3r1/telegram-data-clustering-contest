      <p>BT has approached Disney about adding the iconic company’s new streaming platform, Disney+, to its television service.</p>
      <p>According to the Sunday Times the move is part of BT’s strategy of making BT TV a streaming “super-aggregator”, where viewers can access the majority of on-demand platforms in a single place.</p>

      <p>Marc Allera, head of BT’s consumer division, said it was in talks with Disney and others about new services for BT TV.</p>
      <p>“Because we have a connection in every other home in the UK, we can provide significant scale and reach for their services,” he told the Sunday Times.</p>
      <p>The launch date of Disney+ in the UK has been set for the end of March. The platform will host a combination of animated classics and hit franchises such as Star Wars and Marvel.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month BT fended off improved bids from Sky and ITV to retain the rights to the Champions League for another three seasons from 2021.</p>
      <p>The new deal is reported to be in the region of £1.2bn, matching the figure it paid for its 2018-21 rights.</p>

      <p>BT already hosts Netflix and Amazon Prime Video through the Youview platform, a joint venture with fellow telecoms firm TalkTalk which provides access to BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4 and My 5.</p>
      <p>In addition, the firm sells Apple’s set-top box in conjunction with mobile business EE, which raises the possibility of adding the Apple TV platform to BT’s growing roster.</p>
