      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:33:28+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/darragh-berry/" target="_blank">Darragh Berry</a></address>
      <p>An "aggressive" girl-led gang assaulted and robbed an elderly man in a shopping centre using a 'ketchup trick'.</p>
      <p>The incident took place at Artane Castle Shopping Centre in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/dublin">Dublin</a> on Saturday morning, November 23.</p>
      <p>The man, in his 70s, was set upon by a group of three after one approached him and put ketchup on his jacket.</p>
      <p>After spilling the condiment on the man, they told the pensioner and pretended to help him clean it off.</p>
      <p>Caught off guard and thinking that he was receiving a random act of kindness from a member of the public, two of the other thugs then came over and stole his wallet.</p>

      <p>He described the attackers - two men and one woman - as "aggressive" and was worried that they may have known him.</p>
      <p>The elderly man's wallet was recovered a short time later but he was shaken following the ordeal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/robbery-artane-gang-dublin-gardai-17307520">In a statement to Dublin Live</a>, a spokeswoman for gardai said: "We can confirm that we attended the scene of a robbery at a shopping centre on Kilmore Road, Artane on Saturday morning at approximately 11am.</p>
