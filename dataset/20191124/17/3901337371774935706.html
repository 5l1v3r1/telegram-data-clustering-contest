      <h1>Makhanya Hat-Trick Crushes Cosmos, Birds In Top Eight</h1>

      <p>GladAfrica Championship leaders, Uthongathi FC, could only manage a goalless draw at home to lowly TS Sporting, however, JDR Stars took full advantage by walloping Jomo Cosmos 5-1, while Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila grabbed third spot after overpowering Real Kings 2-1.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there were welcome wins for Swallows FC, Mbombela United and Cape Umoya United.</p>
      <p>Ezenkosi were no match for the Hammer Boys at the Giant Stadium, where their star player, Moeketsi Makhanya, nabbed a neat hat-trick to bring his goal tally up to seven.</p>
      <p>Other goal scorers were Sello "Tsiki" Letooane and Vusimuzi Mncube, which lifted Stars to within four points of the Cane Cutters, whereas Cosmos sunk back into the dreaded drop zone.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Onyedikachi Ononogbu and Ndabayithethwa Ndlondlo, Tshakhuma secured their fifth victory as Kings remain mid-table.</p>
      <p>Despite missing a penalty, the Birds stunned Free State Stars 1-0 at Goble Park courtesy of Lebohang Mokoena’s winner, a result that puts Brandon Truter’s outfit into the top eight.</p>
      <p>Mbombela’s new head coach, Simon Ngomane, got off to a flying start after his charges crushed Richards Bay FC 4-0 in Mpumalanga with Felix Badenhorst netting a brace, while Senzo Gumede and Sabelo Ndzinisa were also on the score-sheet.</p>
      <p>The Spirited Ones showed TS Galaxy, who was best in an exciting match at the Athlone Stadium, which ended 3-1 following their two late goals.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Tauriq Dien’s free kick paved the way for a mix-up in Galaxy’s defence that led to an own goal before Bathusi Aubaas levelled matters via the penalty spot.</p>
      <p>But clever finishes from Ddiviwe Mdabuka and Muzomuhle Khanyi left defeated coach, Dan Malesela, pondering his next move after five matches without a victory and a mere point from relegation.</p>
      <p>Last-placed Royal Eagles sunk even further into danger when Steenberg United beat them 1-0 in the Mother City via Colin Ryan’s strike.</p>
