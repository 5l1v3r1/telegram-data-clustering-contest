      <h1>Steven Gerrard heaps praise on match-winner Ryan Kent</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/rangers/"><b>Rangers</b></a> boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/steven-gerrard/"><b>Steven Gerrard</b></a> hailed <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ryan-kent/"><b>Ryan Kent</b></a>'s "world class" wonder strike – but warned the rest of his stars a repeat of their sloppy second-half display against Hamilton could cost them in Rotterdam.</h2>

      <p>Kent reopened his Light Blues account with two goals in his side's 3-1 Ladbrokes Premiership win at the Foys Stadium as he started repaying the £7million it cost Gerrard to lure the winger back from Liverpool.</p>
      <p>His first – which put Rangers back in front after Accies youngster <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lewis-smith/"><b>Lewis Smith</b></a> had cancelled out <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ryan-jack/"><b>Ryan Jack</b></a>'s early opener – was the pick of the bunch as he dropped a shoulder before unleashing an unstoppable left-footed drive into the top corner.</p>
      <p>Kent went on to rubber-stamp the victory with a cool stoppage-time finish but his boss was unhappy with the way his team stepped off the gas after half-time.</p>
      <p>However, he had nothing but praise for his match-winner.</p>
      <p>"I thought Ryan was terrific today for large parts of the game," said Gerrard, whose team now match leaders Celtic on 34 points. "His first goal was an absolute world-class strike. In any game, if you score a goal like that on your so-called weak side, you deserve a lot of credit for it.</p>
      <p>"The second one was a composed finish which we have been working on a lot with him. That's what he's got to keep doing, providing those moments which help his team-mates get maximum points.</p>
      <p>"I know everyone will get excited about his two goals today, he will get the headlines and rightly so.</p>
      <p>"But we still have to be patient with him because he is still searching for match fitness and sharpness, 100 per cent being at it. They are his own words.</p>
      <p>"So once we get him a little bit more tuned in and sharper, you will see more moments and displays like today.</p>
      <p>"But that's the exact reason the fans all wanted him here and why we were desperate to get the deal done – he is such an important player to us."</p>
      <p>But Gerrard was less than impressed with his team's approach to the second 45 minutes, where Rangers survived three close shaves as Hamilton pushed for an equaliser.</p>
      <p>Rangers now turn their attention to Thursday's Europa League clash with Feyenoord, with a win at De Kuip meaning the Light Blues follow Celtic into the last 32.</p>
      <p>But Gerrard says his team will need to sharpen up.</p>
      <p>"It's another positive result and three points away from home against a team who were very competitive and gave their manager everything they had," he said. "So you have to give Hamilton a lot of respect and credit.</p>
      <p>"Our performance was very mixed. At times, we looked like we had a lot of quality and created lots of chances. But, at times, we looked a bit vulnerable as well.</p>
      <p>"We haven't been ruthless or defended well enough. We have to be better in the final third and kill teams off.</p>
      <p>"We'll need to find a better performance than today. Today was good enough because we win the game and the points we've got are important.</p>
      <p>"But we're going into a game away to Feyenoord we'll need to find a better performance."</p>
      <p>Defeat sees Hamilton drop to second bottom but manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/brian-rice/"><b>Brian Rice</b></a> insists his men are not going down lightly.</p>
      <p>He said: "We are going to be in a dogfight. Let's not make any mistakes about that. There are going to be five or six teams in a dogfight and we are going to be one of them.</p>
      <p>"But I'll tell you one thing: we are always up for a fight. You saw a team out there today that never gave up.</p>
      <p>"They play for one another, for me and for the club. There will be good days and there will be bad days."</p>
