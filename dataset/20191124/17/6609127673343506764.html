      <p>She flaunted her incredible figure as she matched up a pair of denim shorts with an oversized cardigan and some wellies.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4252673/celtic-marian-shved-wag-wife-olya-ukraine-training/">mum-of-one</a> looked like she was enjoying some time in the countryside.</p>
      <p>Fans couldn't get enough of the pic - which has racked up hundreds of likes since it was posted.</p>
      <p>It's not the first racy pic that's garnered approval from fans.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4546307/celtic-olya-shved-marian-wag-glasgow/">model flaunted her pins</a> as she posed in a swanky motor after moving to Glasgow hubby Marian.</p>
      <p>The pair, who tied the knot in 2016, haven't been shy about sharing a string of love-up snaps on social media - Olya proving her man's number one fan.</p>

      <p>And the smitten Celtic star is often the first to comment on Olya's racy snaps - branding her a "beauty" in sweet messages.</p>
      <p>We told last week how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4963867/marian-shved-celtic-transfer-news-no-regrets/">Marian had no regrets</a> over moving to Scotland despite paying just 35 minutes for the Hoops.</p>
      <p>The £2million winger was signed last season by Brendan Rodgers just before he quit to join Leicester City and was immediately loaned back to homeland club Karpaty Lviv.</p>
      <p>It came after Olya shared a number of festive snaps on social media as she got into the Christmas spirit in Edinburgh and Glasgow.</p>
      <p>And she's not the only WAG excited about the upcoming holidays.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Sun previously reported how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4989779/celtic-wag-helen-flanagan-mds-santa-christmas-wonderland/">Helen Flanagan</a> opened M&amp;D's new magical Santa wonderland this weekend.</p>
      <p>Adorable snaps showed Helen enjoying ice-skating with daughter Matilda and also visiting Santa at his grotto.</p>
