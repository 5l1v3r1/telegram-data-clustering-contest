      <h2>The Prime Minister looks after Tory donors and billionaires while treating working folk with the contempt of a smooth-tongued Charles Ponzi, writes Kevin Maguire</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:56:33+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:56</time> by <a rel="author">Kevin Maguire, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/kevinmaguire/</a></address>
      <p>Nobody believes a word uttered by pathological liar Boris Johnson, a Tory cheat fibbing to all voters and not only lovers or the Queen.</p>
      <p>This Conservative manifesto's promises are as hollow as that pledge in the last to keep the Labour free TV licences for over-75s he's busily stealing.</p>
      <p>Because valueless, immoral Johnson says anything to be elected then treats the country like dumped Jennifer Arcuri.</p>
      <p>His own position, status, urges, ego are what drive the ultimate Self-servative, a charlatan emphasising the Con in Conservative with his serial deception.</p>
      <p>Johnson looks after Tory donors and billionaires while treating working folk with the contempt of a smooth-tongued Charles Ponzi.</p>
      <p>His scorn is horrifying when the Tories stick a tissue paper over deep wounds inflicted by his own austerity mob over nine devasting years.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn and Labour at least recognise the need for radical surgery to repair the damage, proposing real change to rebuild a better Britain based on shared prosperity and social justice.</p>

      <p>Johnson declaring he'd fill a few of the hundreds of thousands of potholes proliferating after his lot slashed council spending is the spin of a fraud careering into a ditch.</p>
      <p>No Tory deceit's greater than the moronic mantra “Get Brexit Done” which he failed to fulfil last year and knows is a poisonous lie when there'd be years of painful trade negotiations.</p>
      <p>Secure a Parliamentary majority and impose his bad Brexit deal and bang goes the Tory sums, respected experts foreseeing a £70bn hole blown in the economy.</p>
      <p>Dissmembling comes naturally to a Prime Minister who replied to a question about trust with three porkies.</p>

      <p>Lying on Brexit or falsely claiming the Cons are putting record money into the NHS(they aren't) or pretending to construct 40 new hospitals(it's six) is an ideological strategy</p>
      <p>Not just to hoodwink the electorate immediately but to destroy any public confidence in the honesty of all politicians so Corbyn's sincerity, and the ability of the Left to represent a coherent alternative to Johnson and the Tory Right, is doubted by the disillusioned who view all politicians the same.</p>
      <p>The choice is huge in this election if you want free broadband, pay rises for low earners, improved schools and hospitals, council housing, social care and Universal Credit replaced.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Corbyn would be the fresh start, Johnson a continuity Conservative.</p>
      <p>The difference between Labour vowing to keep taxes fundamentally unchanged for 95% and the Tories for 100% isn't the 5% on upwards of £80,000 a year contributing a bit more.</p>
      <p>The contrast is decent public services with Labour and ongoing decline with the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>Both sides aren't exaggerating for once in highlighting the chasm between the two main parties.</p>
      <p>The Cons would win a decent majority if the election was this Thursday so mercifully it isn't, although crucial postal votes go out this week hence a Tory unconventional Sunday launch.</p>
      <p>Much will happen in the two-and-a-half weeks until 12 December.</p>
      <p>Hopefully Britain will wake up instead of sleepwalking into a Johnsonian nightmare.</p>
      <p>Corbyn in 2019 is offering the new dawn that Blair spoke of in 1997 then never delivered.</p>
