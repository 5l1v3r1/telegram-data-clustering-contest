      <p>Nov. 24 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Pope_Francis/?tps=1">Pope Francis</a> described the use of atomic energy for weapons of war as immoral while visiting Japan on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Pope traveled to Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the first day of a three-day trip in Japan as he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/24/pope-francis-hiroshima-atomic-bomb-073213">delivered a speech</a> calling for world powers to eliminate their nuclear arsenals before survivors of the 1945 U.S. atomic bombings on the country.</p>
      <p>"The use of atomic energy for purposes of war is immoral," he said. "As is the possession of atomic weapons."</p>
      <p>Speaking in Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park, Pope Francis questioned how world leaders can propose peace while <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-in-hiroshima-never-again-war-78425">reserving nuclear warfare</a> as a means to settle conflicts.</p>
      <p>"May the abyss of pain endured here remind us of boundaries that must never be crossed. A true peace can only be an unarmed peace," he said.</p>
      <p>Pope Francis said he visited Japan as a "pilgrim of peace" to recall the victims of nuclear warfare and stand with them in prayer.</p>
      <p>"With deep conviction I wish once more to declare that the use of atomic energy for purposes of war is today, more than ever, a crime not only against the dignity of human beings but against any possible future for our common home," he said.</p>
      <p>The Pope <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/11/23/Pope-Francis-lands-in-Japan-decades-after-missionary-dream/2881574519722/">arrived in Japan</a> on Saturday for the trip including a meeting with victims of the 2011 major earthquake and subsequent tsunami that sparked a meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.</p>
