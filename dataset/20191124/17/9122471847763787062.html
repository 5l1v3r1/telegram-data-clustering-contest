      <p>Former Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer went 7-0 against Michigan during his tenure in Columbus. The Buckeyes will attempt to keep the streak going on Saturday in Ann Arbor.</p>
      <p>Meyer will be on hand for the game at Michigan Stadium, as FOX’s <i>Big Noon Kickoff </i>will broadcast live from Ann Arbor.</p>
      <p>The former Ohio State head coach will make his official pick for the game on Saturday, but he’s already revealed it.</p>
      <p>There is no surprise.</p>
      <p>“No chance I’m picking Michigan,” Meyer said on FOX following Ohio State’s win over Penn State.</p>
      <p>The former Buckeyes’ head coach does have respect for the Wolverines.</p>
      <p>“I will tell you this — do I respect good football teams? Always. That’s a good football team up there. That is a good team,” Meyer said.</p>
