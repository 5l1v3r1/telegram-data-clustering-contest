      <p>This article is part of a series that provides an ongoing analysis of the changes made to David Tepper's 13F portfolio on a quarterly basis. It is based on Appaloosa Management's regulatory <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1656456/000165645619000008/0001656456-19-000008-index.htm">13F Form</a> filed on 11/14/2019.

      <p>This quarter, Tepper's 13F portfolio value decreased from $9.26B to $3.41B.

The number of holdings decreased from 26 to 24. The top-five individual stock positions are Alphabet (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG">GOOG</a>) (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL">GOOGL</a>), Facebook (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FB">FB</a>), Amazon (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN">AMZN</a>), Altaba, and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU">MU</a>).
