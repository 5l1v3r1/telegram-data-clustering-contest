      <h1>Dumbarton 3-1 Forfar Athletic - Sons dare to dream of cup run</h1>
      <h2>Goals from Adam Frizzell, Ryan McGeever and Isaac Layne saw off the threat of League One rivals Forfar.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:51:32+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:51</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Clarke, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-clarke/</a></address>
      <p>Dumbarton kept their Scottish Cup dream alive with a solid showing against League One rivals Forfar Athletic.</p>
      <p>Having fallen at the first hurdle to opponents from their division last season, there was no repeat of the third round exit - despite Jim Duffy being without a number of key players.</p>
      <p>Missing Rico Quitongo with a back injury, Joe McKee through a back injury and illness and Reghan Tumilty - who wasn’t granted permission to play by parent club Greenock Morton - Jim Duffy made three changes to the side with Matthew Shiels, Stefan McCluskey and Jordan McMillan, making his first start since early August, all handed a place in the 11.</p>
      <p>And Duffy was pleased with the impact the players who have found themselves on the fringes made.</p>
      <p>He said: “Considering we had a number of players unavailable today the boys coming in did really well.</p>
      <p>It was Jordan McMillan’s first 90 minutes since the opening day of the season down at Annan and he did really well. There were a lot of positives for us, but the most important thing was getting the victory.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t an easy game, we didn’t expect it to be with Forfar being in the same league and having a new manager - but I felt we deserved to win the tie. We scored a few really good goals.</p>
      <p>“Second-half I feel like there wasn’t too much in the game, but it allowed us to manage things a wee bit more.</p>
      <p>“Once we got the second goal I was confident that we could see the game out and the third gave us a bit of a cushion.</p>
      <p>“Cup ties are about being in the next round and I think we deserved to win it.”</p>
      <p>New Loons manager Stuart Malcolm almost got off to a dream start when Callum Tapping should’ve done better than fire tamely at Sons’ keeper Conor Brennan from eight yards.</p>
      <p>And his side were made to pay for squandering the early opening as the hosts took the lead inside the opening 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>Isaac Layne held up play and occupied Darren Whyte before finding Adam Frizzell in space at the edge of the box, and the Kilmanock loanee shifted the ball onto his left foot and drilled a deflected effort beyond Mark McCallum.</p>
      <p>The lead lasted just 11 minutes.</p>
      <p>Tapping collected Ross Meechan’s cross just inside the penalty area and, from a tight angle, brilliantly lobbed the ball over Brennan and into the top corner of the net.</p>
      <p>Dumbarton almost responded immediately as Frizzell, on the hunt for a fourth goal of the season against Forfar, called McCallum into action - but this time the big keeper was equal to his effort.</p>
      <p>After a lively start the game became clogged in a midfield battle, with neither team’s keeper being tested and Jordan Kirkpatrick’s blushes for a glaring miss from close range being saved by the assistant’s flag.</p>
      <p>The second period followed a similar trend, with Forfar arguably the better side, but appearing content to sit tight and take a draw.</p>
      <p>And they were made to pay for a lack of cutting edge as Dumbarton took the lead.</p>
      <p>Strong work down the right from the outstanding Jordan McMillan won a corner, with Ryan McGeever on hand to power Stefan McCluskey’s delivery low beyond McCallum and into the net for the big defender’s fourth goal in seven games.</p>
      <p>And the victory was secured with 10 minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>Conor Brennan’s colossal drop kick split the Forfar defence and sent Isaac layne clean through, and he kept his cool to shrug off Michael Travis and slide the ball through McCallum’s legs.</p>
