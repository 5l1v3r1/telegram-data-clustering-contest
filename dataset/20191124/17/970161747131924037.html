      <p>A mum has been charged with murder after her infant daughters were found dead inside her car on a 31C day.</p>
      <p>Attempts to revive the girls failed and both were declared dead in Logan City, south of Brisbane, Australia.</p>
      <p>The girls’ father said Darcey Conley, two, and Chloe-Ann, one, were ‘two peas in a pod’ and said Kerri-Ann Conley, 27, adored her daughters.</p>
      <p>Police have said the toddlers died from exposure to extreme heat and are building a timeline to determine how long they spent in the car.</p>
      <p>Officers are investigating whether Ms Conley was under the influence of drugs at the time. She will appear in court on Monday.</p>

      <p>Ms Conley was already known to police, according to <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/logan-children-dead-after-being-left-in-hot-car-brisbane-news/d120dba2-d9d2-43ec-97be-0a378e6320a7">9News</a>, which said she rushed the girls into a cool bath inside her home after finding them in the car.</p>

      <p>A neighbour claimed her grandson saw the toddlers in the car at 6.30am, seven hours before they were found, according to the Daily Mail.</p>
      <p>Australian emergency services rescue more than 2,000 unattended children from cars each year, according to the National Roads and Motorists’ Association.</p>
      <p>The organisation warns temperatures in a parked car can be more than 30 degrees hotter than outside the car, and three-quarters of this temperature increase happens within five minutes of the car being closed.</p>
