      <p>A nursing assistant has suffered a slew of injuries after mixing her antidepressants with whiskey and vodka and falling from a fourth-floor window.</p>
      <p>Megan Heidgerd, 22, posed for a selfie in newly-bought clothes just five hours before blacking out and falling more than 40 feet from her roommate’s bedroom window.</p>
      <p>She landed on the concrete patio of the apartment building’s swimming pool in Pensacola, Florida, breaking her right food and knee and slicing open her left leg.</p>
      <p>The hospital worker from Connecticut also sustained head injuries which took 20 stitches to put right.</p>
      <p>Megan blames the fall on mixing her prescribed Prozac medication with spirits.</p>

      <p>‘I know that you are not supposed to mix meds and alcohol but I didn’t think about it, or I didn’t really care.’</p>
      <p>‘I remember being cautious because even without meds, you shouldn’t drink too much,’ she said.</p>
      <p>‘I went to the store and I bought three tiny bottles of vodka and I told myself that was all I was going to drink for the night.’</p>
