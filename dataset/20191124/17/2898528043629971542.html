      <h1>Andre Fili vs. Sodiq Yusuff in the works for UFC 246 on Jan. 18</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:27:24+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:27</time> by <a rel="author">Damon Martin</a></address>
      <p>A featherweight fight between <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1907/andre-fili">Andre Fili</a> and top prospect <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4684/sodiq-yusuff">Sodiq Yusuff</a> is currently in the works for the upcoming card on Jan. 18 that is expected to be <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1086/ufc-246">UFC 246</a>.</p>
      <p>The show number isn’t finalized just yet because the UFC hasn’t made an official announcement regarding the event but the card will likely serve as the first pay-per-view of 2020 with the return of <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1859/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> tentatively scheduled for that date.</p>
      <p>Multiple sources confirmed that verbal agreements are in place for the contest when speaking to MMA Fighting on Sunday following an initial report from <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/andre-fili-vs-sodiq-yusuff-featherweight-ufc-246-jan-18">MMAJunkie</a>.</p>
      <p>For Fili, this will be a chance to build on his current two-fight win streak as the Team Alpha Male fighter returns following a knockout win in his last outing against <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3127/sheymon-moraes">Sheymon Moraes</a>. Overall, Fili is 4-1 in his past five fights with his only loss coming in a razor-close split decision to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/728/michael-johnson">Michael Johnson</a>.</p>
      <p>Yusuff will look to keep his perfect record inside the Octagon intact after he joined the roster by way of <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2230/dana-white">Dana White</a>’s Tuesday Night Contender Series. Since making his debut, Yusuff has rattled off three straight wins with two knockouts along the way including a TKO against <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3095/gabriel-benitez">Gabriel Benitez</a> in his last appearance back in August.</p>
      <p>Assuming Fili vs. Yusuff is finalized, the featherweights would join a growing card scheduled for Jan. 18 as the UFC continues negotiations with McGregor on his return in hopes that he will headline the show.</p>
