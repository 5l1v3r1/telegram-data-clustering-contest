      <p>We’re still not sure why <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/11/will-ferrell-ryan-reynolds-snl-monologue-sketch-watch.html">Ryan Reynolds</a> and his tasteful sailing vest were all over <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/11/will-ferrell-ryan-reynolds-snl-monologue-sketch-watch.html">this week’s <i>SNL </i>episode</a>, but at least his “Weekend Update” appearance doubled as an amusing footnote: He, as <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/scarlett-johansson-says-she-has-the-right-to-play-any-person.html">Scarlett Johansson’s</a> ex-husband, got to pal around with Colin Jost, Scarlett Johansson’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/scarlett-johansson-and-colin-jost-are-engaged.html">current fiancé</a>, by saying things like “skin slinky” and “class leads to ass.” Or dare we forget, “play a little under-the-table footsie that’ll have her saying, ‘Is that a giant old soft decaying banana in your pants or are you just happy to see me?’” The advice might be terrible, but at least the duo are self-proclaimed BFFs.</p>
