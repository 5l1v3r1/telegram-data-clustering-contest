      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ant-mcpartlin">Ant McPartlin</a> left <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I’m A Celebrity</a> viewers in stitches last night after he joked about <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/declan-donnelly">Dec Donnelly</a> 's height and picked him up to recreate his first kiss.</p>
      <p>The legendary TV duo have made jokes about their heights repeatedly throughout their career, especially while filming down under in the Australian Outback.</p>
      <p>During last night's episode of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! Dec's height was once again the subject of the joke as the Brit presenting favourites reminisced about Dec's first kiss in a lift.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the show, Girls Aloud star Nadine opened up about her first kiss to an Irish lad from school, Arsenal legend Ian confessed he felt like he was "in a trance" after his first lock of lips, while Cliff Parisi said his first kiss was in a lift.</p>

      <p>Ant, 44, then mocked Dec's first kiss after he cheekily divulged juicy details about his best friend's first kiss and admitted he was witness to the encounter.</p>
      <p>He revealed: "There is a coincidence there though because your first kiss was in a lift wasn't it Dec?</p>
      <p>"I remember because I nearly broke my back lifting you up to reach that girl, but I did it!"</p>

      <p>Dec, 44, continued the joke by confessing: "You only had to do it once then I bought a step ladder and we didn't need you and we could kiss in peace."</p>
      <p>After announcing the next trial, Dec joked: "Everybody needs a lift sometimes."</p>
      <p>Ant finished by hilariously saying: "Want another one for old times sake?!"</p>
      <p>Dec smirked as Ant lifted up his co-star in a hilarious embrace and squeezed him tightly.</p>
      <p>Their sweet embrace was captured with a fun <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> snap and showed Dec as slightly taller than Ant for the first time ever.</p>

      <p>They posted the photo with the caption: "We all need someone that lifts us up," and fans instantly rushed to the comment section to comment on their friendship.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "Ant picking up Dec!!!" followed by a series of laughing face emojis.</p>
      <p>While another shared: "Ant lifting Dec is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen in my life."</p>
      <p>A third commented: "Ant lifting Dec is so precious"</p>
      <p>Another viewer added: "The sad thing is: I can really picture Ant lifting Dec so he's able to kiss his girlfriend who's like two heads taller than him."</p>

      <p>Gags about height have never been far from I’m A Celebrity, with Ant and Dec describing 2017 contestant Dennis Wise as ‘a very small man’, even though he is actually 5ft 6.</p>
      <p>All of which was ultimately settled when Dennis was voted out of the jungle – and was revealed to actually be taller than Dec.</p>
