      <p>Although we’re not <i>quite</i> there yet, it’s getting to the time of year when you can start putting up Christmas decorations without <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/family-ordered-take-christmas-decorations-early-11090953/">making your neighbours hate you</a>.</p>
      <p>Filling up your house with light is certainly one way of making the dark nights of winter less gloomy, but decorations are often expensive.</p>
      <p>The good news is that Asda is selling a reindeer disco ball that only costs £5, and it’s already been getting rave reviews.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://direct.asda.com/george/christmas-shop/lights/glitter-reindeer-head-christmas-light/050720271,default,pd.html?awc=2925_1574614585_232e1efe98a22ae2ce59176cc46d4273&amp;source=2925&amp;promotype=Sub+Networks&amp;cmpid=afc-_-GEOR-_-awin-_-101248-_%20-generic&amp;cm_mmc=GEOR-aff-_-awin-_-adgoal-_-101248&amp;awin_aff=101248_adgoal_adgoal+GmbH+-+Content_Sub+Networks&amp;utm_source=101248&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_campaign=Performance-George&amp;dclid=CjkKEQiA8ejuBRDCwLDTnr7k6bABEiQAth2kfoE-l0PpnNUV12YzGThiU9-d5vPd2HlWtkUIcWk8dILw_wcB">description on the website</a> says: ‘This sparkly reindeer head Christmas light from George Home is the perfect way to illuminate your home this Christmas. Sporting gold-effect glitter antlers and a big red nose, what’s not to love?’</p>
      <p>It needs two AA batteries so stock up ahead of the festive season.</p>
      <p>On Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ExtremeCouponingAndBargainsUK/">Extreme Couponing and Bargains group</a>, one delighted woman wrote, ‘Bigger then I expected… It’s really cute and it stands out, my two-year-old loves looking at it.</p>

      <p>‘It’s perfect if you have kids as it looks like a glittery disco light… Great price for something so lovely.’</p>
      <p>She wasn’t the only one to be happy with her purchase.</p>
      <p>Another user wrote: ‘So happy I bought this, it’s actually better than I was expecting and has the added bonus of being an absolute bargain.’</p>
      <p>If you’re on the hunt for bargain Christmas decorations, Aldi are also selling <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/aldis-limited-edition-kevin-the-carrot-toys-are-now-on-sale-11208769/">a range of toys</a> based on their ‘Kevin the Carrot’ adverts, beginning at £3.99.
