      <p>Shopping is different today than it was 10 years ago.</p>
      <p>In the last decade, shopping has gone through a serious evolution that was in no small way impacted by the rise of e-commerce, Amazon, and augmented and virtual reality, as well as the decline of the department store.</p>
      <p>“E-commerce giant Amazon got one component right of the shopping experience – they focused on access, ease and convenience when customers wanted it,” Leesa Wytock, the group director of experience at global brand strategy firm Siegel+Gale, told Business Insider in an email.</p>
      <p>The Amazon threat is just one of the factors spurring this shopping evolution. With the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/retail-apocalypse">retail apocalypse</a> ripping through the US, more than <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stores-closing-in-2019-list-2019-3">9,100 stores</a> are expected to close in 2019. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-malls-have-changed-over-last-decade-2019-11">Malls</a> across the country are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/american-retail-apocalypse-in-photos-2018-1">dying </a>as department stores like Macy’s and Sears, once important anchors for mall foot traffic, are closing down for good.</p>
      <p>Stores and brands are being propelled into a new era of shopping, one where brick-and-mortar stores must adapt to survive.</p>
      <p>Business Insider consulted with Wytock and Brian Byer, the vice president and general manager of Blue Fountain Media, to find the six biggest changes to shopping in the last decade.</p>
      <p>Here’s what they said:</p>
