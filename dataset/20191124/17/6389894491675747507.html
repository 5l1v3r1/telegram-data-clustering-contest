      <p>The former New York mayor and eighth-richest American is embarking on a $31m ad splurge as he looks to see off current frontrunners such as Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>The 77-year-old said he was running “to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America”, despite having previously ruled out claims that he would enter the race.</p>
      <p>The presidential hopeful, who owns media company Bloomberg, is believed to be worth roughly $54.4bn.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg’s unusually late entry comes against a backdrop of increasing political pressure on billionaires, with several of his fellow candidates hitting out at the ultra-wealthy and pledging new wealth taxes on the super rich.</p>

      <p>Among Bloomberg’s initial campaign policies is a promise to expand health insurance, address climate change and raise taxes on the wealthy.</p>
      <p>Trump has previously taken aim at Bloomberg amid speculation that he would run for President, telling reporters earlier this month: “There’s nobody I would rather run against than Little Michael.”</p>
