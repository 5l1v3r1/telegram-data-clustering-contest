      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> legend Gary Neville has slammed Phil Jones after the defender failed to deal with Oliver Norwood’s ‘agricultural’ pass which led to John Fleck’s opening goal at Bramall Lane.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/24/gary-neville-sends-warning-manchester-united-players-sheffield-united-clash-11210541/">Neville predicted that his former club could be in for a tough afternoon before kick-off</a> and his fears were confirmed as the Blades dominated in the early stages of Sunday’s only <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> encounter.</p>
      <p>David de Gea’s stunning double save kept Chris Wilder’s side out in the 12th minute but the Spaniard could do nothing about Fleck’s strike in the 19th minute.</p>
      <p>Norwood played an aerial ball over Jones’ head and Lys Mousset barged the centre-back off the ball before haring into the box and finding John Lundstram.</p>
      <p>Lundstrum’s shot was saved by De Gea but the loose ball rebounded off Fleck into the corner of the net, to the dismay of former United right-back Neville.</p>

      <p>‘If ever a goal had been coming… the warning signs were there. [Harry] Maguire and Jones, they can’t handle the running of Mousset and [David] McGoldrick in behind them,’ Neville said on Sky Sports’ commentary.</p>

      <p>‘It’s agricultural, it’s a channel ball, the easiest ball in the world for a centre-back to deal with and Phil Jones doesn’t deal with it.</p>
      <p>‘Sheffield United get their just rewards. There’s a little bit of good fortune at the end.</p>
      <p>‘Jones just has a look over his shoulder and in that moment he loses control of the duel and Sheffield United, look at them – four of them in the box!</p>
      <p>‘Mousset gets his reward for following in.’</p>
      <p>Neville added: ‘Manchester United’s record when they go a goal behind away from home has been poor.</p>
      <p>‘Sometimes watching Manchester United away from home, it’s almost like they’re shocked that the other team are up for it, and they’re at it and have energy.</p>
      <p>‘Look at them, getting to the ball.</p>
      <p>‘Mousset had already given Maguire and Jones a tough time before that – third time lucky!</p>
      <p>‘But for a centre-back… a channel ball that you can see coming from 50 yards away is such a simple ball to be able to deal with. It really is.’</p>
