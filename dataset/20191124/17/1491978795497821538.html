      <h1>A fitting change to the Friday night schedule</h1>

        <i>Child poverty | Jail terms | Question Time leaders’ special | Mildura city</i>
      </p>
      <p>The home secretary wants us to believe the substantial increase in child poverty is somehow not the result of policies pursued by the government since 2010 (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/priti-patel-says-tory-government-not-to-blame-for-poverty-in-uk">Report</a>, 22 November). And if the Tories were to be re-elected and child poverty jumps to over 5 million by 2022, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/02/child-poverty-britain-set-to-soar-to-new-record-ifs">predicted</a> by the Institute for Fiscal Studies two years ago, then presumably, again, we should not attach any blame to her party.<br/><b>David Winnick</b><br/><i>Labour MP for Walsall North 1979-2017</i></p>
      <p>• Ten-year and eight-year sentences for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/22/detectorists-jailed-for-stealing-12m-viking-hoard-of-gold-and-silver">detectorists jailed for the theft of a Viking’s treasure</a>; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/22/two-men-who-raped-woman-in-soho-nightclub-jailed">seven and a half years each for two men who raped a woman in a Soho nightclub</a> (Reports, 23 November). Can I suggest that the respective judges attend a training course on the meaning of social justice.<br/><b>Steven Bowditch</b><br/><i>Carlisle, Cumbria</i></p>
      <p>• I wonder how many Guardian readers like myself missed BBC One’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/23/question-time-four-way-leaders-debate-gets-peak-audience-of-46m">Question Time leaders’ special</a> on Friday night as it failed to make the TV schedule in your Friday paper. Wake up at the back!<br/><b>Phil Lee</b><br/><i>Elslack,</i><i> North Yorkshire</i></p>
      <p>• Anyone tuning in to see Would I Lie To You? on Friday night would have seen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> instead and would probably have concluded they hadn’t missed it after all.<br/><b>Brian Allen</b><br/><i>Birdham</i><i>, West Sussex</i></p>
      <p>• While appreciating the publicity given Mildura’s plight in Australia’s heatwave (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/21/victorian-town-mildura-unliveable-massive-dust-storm-40c-heat">Suffocating dust storm adds to town’s woes</a>, 22 November) as a former resident I must point out that Mildura is not a town, having been proclaimed a regional city in 1934.<br/><b>Murray Hedgcock</b><br/><i>London</i></p>
