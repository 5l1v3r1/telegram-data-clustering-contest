      <h1>Woman with cancer has 'best day of her life' as dying trike ride wish granted</h1>
      <h2>'I still have not come down from the high'</h2>

      <p>A Nottinghamshire woman has had the "best day of her life" after she was granted her dying wish to ride a motorcycle trike.</p>
      <p>Pat Whitehead, 76, of Ollerton, was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/health/">terminal lung cancer</a> earlier this month and told she had four to six months to live.</p>
      <p>She always wanted to take a journey on a motorcycle trike, and to walk the Great Wall of China.</p>
      <p>And on Sunday, November 24, alongside her close friend Annie Homer, 78, she was granted her bucket list wish.</p>
      <p>As she's not able to go to China, Pat's close friend Alice Brazier, 63, of Ollerton, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/friends-help-grant-dying-74-3562394">helped grant one of her wishes by helping to organise the trike ride with a bike convoy for free.</a></p>
      <p>The three friends have known each other for years and play bingo together at the Ambleside Community Centre in Yew Tree Road, Ollerton.</p>
      <p>Volunteers came forward to take Pat on the trike, with a motorcycle convoy leaving from Ollerton and taking her to Clumber Park near <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/worksop">Worksop</a> and back.</p>

      <p>"I still have not come down from the high," Pat told Nottinghamshire Live.</p>
      <p>"It was without a doubt the best day of my life. I only wish I did it 40 years ago. I felt no pain while I was on the trike, just joy.</p>
      <p>"We went ever so quick it was so much fun.</p>
      <p>"I'm extremely grateful to the people who helped organise this for me. I'll never forget it.</p>

      <p>"Nick Farmer rode the trike. He was such a gentleman. He was checking we weren't too cold and if we were okay.</p>
      <p>"My friend Annie loved it as well. I am so happy with it. It's what I wanted to do and now I have done it."</p>
