      <h1>Ohio State AD Has A Message For The Heisman Trophy Voters</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:01:09+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State held on to beat Penn State yesterday, winning 28-17 after almost blowing a 21-0 lead. Without Chase Young, they may have lost the game.</p>
      <p>In his first game back from a two-game suspension, Young was dominant. He recorded a career-high nine tackles (four for loss), three sacks and a pair of forced fumbles.</p>
      <p>Multiple times during Penn State’s second half comeback attempt, Young halted drives and changed the conjecture of the game with big plays. For his effort, he was named the Walter Camp national defensive player of the week.</p>
      <p>However, there are some who think Young is worthy of a bigger award, the ultimate one in fact. Many, including Ohio State AD Gene Smith, feel Young should be a legitimate candidate for the Heisman Trophy.</p>
      <p>Smith shared his support for Young’s Heisman bid on Twitter this morning,</p>
      <p>“There is not doubt Chase Young has earned the right to be in New York and win the Heisman,” Smith tweeted. “If it is for the most outstanding player in college football. He is certainly that!!”</p>

      <p>Right now, LSU quarterback Joe Burrow has all but clinched the Heisman for this year. It is essentially a quarterback award at this point, and a defensive player has not won since Michigan’s Charles Woodson in 1997.</p>
      <p>But Smith is right. At the very least, Young should be in New York next month for the Heisman Trophy ceremony. Not having him there would be borderline farcical considering the season he has had.</p>
