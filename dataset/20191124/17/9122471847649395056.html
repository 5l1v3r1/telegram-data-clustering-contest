      <h1>The Week 14 Coaches’ Poll Top 25 Has Been Released</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:54:26+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The Week 14 Coaches’ Poll top 25 has been released following Saturday’s Week 13 games. There’s been a bit of a shakeup inside the top 10.</p>
      <p>Week 13 was highlighted by Oregon’s stunning upset loss to Arizona State. The Ducks are now out of the College Football Playoff race.</p>
      <p>Alabama and Oklahoma were arguably the biggest winners of Week 13. If Oregon can beat Utah in the Pac-12 Championship Game, one of the Crimson Tide/Sooners will likely get the fourth spot in the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>There’s still one week left in the regular season, of course.</p>
