        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/pete-davidson/">Pete Davidson</a> playfully squirted a water gun at paparazzi while on a PDA-packed trip with new beau Kaia Gerber.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The comedian took aim at photographers who got too close to his comfort zone while smoking a suspicious-looking cigarette in Miami.</p>
      <p>What better way to get people to back off than squirting water at them?</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old and his model beau were enjoying a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/pete-davidson-and-kaia-gerber-pack-on-the-pda-as-they-pucker-up-on-poolside-date-11207655/">poolside date and were not afraid to pucker up</a> while they were there.</p>
      <p>So they are pretty much official now, right? Kaia sported a black bikini and a huge pair of shades, while Pete looked casual in shorts and a graphic t-shirt, while he also wore his own pair of sunglasses.</p>
      <p>The couple could be seen relaxing on the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/pete-davidson-and-kaia-gerber-pack-on-the-pda-as-they-pucker-up-on-poolside-date-11207655/">sunbeds before they both decided to lean in for a kiss</a>, and at one point, their tongues were clearly on display.</p>

      <p>They packed on the PDA while hanging out with their friends at the pool, and we’re guessing Pete was the one who suggested bringing water guns.</p>

      <p>In between kisses with Kaia, 18, Pete went back and forth between his ‘cigarette’ and water gun fun.</p>
      <p>At one point, their tongues were clearly on display and we’re starting to think they’re messing with us.</p>
      <p>The two haven’t confirmed or denied whether they are official or not, but first <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/24/pete-davidson-sparks-romance-rumours-kaia-gerber-cosy-lunch-date-split-margaret-qualley-10974786/">sparked dating rumours after they were spotted enjoying a lunch date in October</a>.</p>
      <p>The comedian also reportedly visited Kaia at her apartment that same day, although a source told Page Six that the two were simply ‘just friends’.</p>
      <p>Pete previously dated Ariana Grande and Kate Beckinsale, before him and Kaia started.</p>
      <p>PDA must be his middle name because he and Kate were once spotted playing tonsil tennis at the New York Rangers and Washington Capitals hockey game.</p>
      <p>Prior to Pete, Kaia had been linked to EastEnders star Patsy Palmer’s son Fenton Markell, and fellow model Wellington Grant.</p>
