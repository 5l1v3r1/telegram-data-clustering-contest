      <p>Goo Hara, K-pop singer and actress, has been found dead in her house in South Korea, according to Gangnam Police Department.</p>
      <p>"We received a report on November 24, 6:30 pm KST about a death," they said in a <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/goo-ha-ra-dead-k-20949360">statement</a> regarding Goo Hara. "We are currently investigating the cause."</p>
      <p>In May, the star, formerly of K-pop group Kara, issued a statement through the Japanese press and apologised to her fans for trying to take her own life.</p>
      <p>The singer had just completed a four-date tour of Japan with solo material including Midnight Queen and Choco Chip Cookies.</p>
      <p>Details surrounding her death have yet to be released.</p>
      <p>Goo Hara, better known as Hara, was a former member of the South Korean girl group Kara.</p>

      <p>Aside from her successful singing career, the star has also appeared in television dramas including 2011's City Hunter, Galileo 2, and Secret Love in 2014. She also featured in her own reality TV programme titled On &amp; Off in December 2014.</p>
      <p>Hara joined the girl group Kara in 2008, following the departure of former member Kim Sung-hee.</p>
      <p>Breaking away from the band seven years later, the star debuted as a solo artist with the release of the EP Alohara (Can You Feel It?), which peaked at number four in the country – and became a commercial success.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Hara was found unconscious by her manager at her home in Seoul’s Gangnam district after a suspected suicide bid.</p>
      <p>The day before, she had posted a one-word message on her Instagram account: "Goodbye."</p>
      <p>During her recovering in hospital, she issued an apology, which read: "I am sorry for causing concerns and a commotion. In terms of health, I am recovering … I had been in agony over a number of overlapping issues. But from now on, I will steel my heart and try to show up healthy."</p>
