      <h1>WAGs of Man City stars Mahrez and Sane in “bum b**ch” row after Deontay Wilder drama</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:49:57+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:49</time> by <a rel="author">Jaikuran Randhawa</a></address>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10409975/manchester-city-mahrez-sane-wags-row/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574580870">the Sun</a>, Riyad Mahrez’s wife Rita and Leroy Sane’s girlfriend Candice Brook have been involved in a shocking row which saw one of them call the other a “bum b**ch”.</p>
      <p>The Sun report that Candice sent a number of abusive text messages to Mahrez’s wife, Rita was reportedly called vile terms like a “groupie b**ch” and also told she looks like “sh*t” by Sane’s partner.</p>
      <p>The Sun highlight that Rita’s recent drama with World Champion heavyweight boxer Deontay Wilder may be the cause of the shocking row and Candice is reportedly a close friend of the knockout artist’s fiancee.</p>
      <p>It was reported earlier this month that Rita and Wilder flirted in a Manchester nightclub , something that the Sun believe left Riyad Mahrez devastated.</p>
      <p>The report also highlights that Mahrez and Sane have spoken to each other privately in an attempt to resolve the feud.</p>
      <p>The Sun’s source also believes that fellow WAGs at City may side with Rita as they think that Candice ‘acted liked a bully’ towards her.</p>

      <p>It’s very rare that we see a WAG feud of such a vicious nature emerging. Manchester City’s Christmas party could be one very awkward occasion for everyone.</p>
      <p>Let’s just hope that Wilder doesn’t head to Manchester anytime soon to celebrate his latest victory, that would be Pep Guardiola’s worst nightmare for his squad.</p>
