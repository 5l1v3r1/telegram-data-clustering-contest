      <h1>Baffled Derek McInnes queries Aberdeen handball claim as he disputes Kevin Clancy explanation</h1>
      <h2>The Dons boss was left unsure after a chat with the referee at half-time during his side's draw with St Johnstone.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:58:47+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:58</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Derek McInnes disputed Kevin Clancy's claim he could not see an <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> penalty claim after his side surrendered two points in Perth.</p>
      <p>Wallace Duffy appeared to deny Curtis Main an easy header on goal with a flick of the hand with the Dons leading <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-johnstone-fc">St Johnstone</a> 1-0 through <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sam-cosgrove">Sam Cosgrove</a> 's 17th goal of the season.</p>
      <p>Matty Kennedy equalised for Saints after the break before Murray Davidson and Callum Hendry were shown straight red cards.</p>
      <p>That sparked a frenzied finish at McDiarmid Park but McInnes' side could not fashion a winner in the dying minutes.</p>
      <p>And the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/derek-mcinnes">Aberdeen</a> boss was baffled by Clancy's insistence his view of the potentially pivotal first-half incident was obstructed.</p>

      <p>He told BBC Sportsound: "It's a penalty. I spoke to the referee at half-time and he said he didn't see it, didn't have a clear view.</p>
      <p>"But the first thing I looked at was I thought he did have a clear view.</p>
      <p>"Between the four officials here on duty... that is a penalty kick every day of the week.</p>
      <p>"We've had few of these now this season where we've suffered for handball incidents - one that was outside the box and at Ross County where I'm not even sure it was a handball and Lewis Ferguson got done.</p>
      <p>"That, for me, is so disappointing. It needs to be better than that to give the penalty kick."</p>
      <p>That aside, McInnes admitted his exasperation at supporters heading back north without a victory to savour.</p>

      <p>He added: "We've got to take responsibility.</p>
      <p>"We had three points in our pocket and we allowed two of them to go. I'm really disappointed with that.</p>
      <p>"From a winning position, we should see that game out. We should have more experience and confidence to see that out.</p>
      <p>"So, I'm bitterly disappointed that a fantastic travelling support came down to see their team win and we couldn't give them that.</p>
