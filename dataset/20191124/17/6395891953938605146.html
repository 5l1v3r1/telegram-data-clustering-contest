      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - The Supreme Court says Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been released from a Baltimore hospital where she had been treated for a possible infection.</p>
      <p>The 86-year-old Ginsburg has returned to her home in Washington, D.C., and is "doing well," court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said Sunday.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg spent two nights at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. She was taken there Friday after experiencing chills and fever.</p>
      <p>The court says she received intravenous antibiotics and fluids and that her symptoms abated.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg has had four occurrences of cancer, including two in the past year. She had lung cancer surgery in December and received radiation treatment for a tumor on her pancreas in August.</p>
      <p>She had a rare absence from a public session of the court in mid-November because of what the court said was a stomach bug. She was back on the bench the next time the justices met.</p>
      <p>Her latest hospital stay began Friday, after the justices met in private to discuss pending cases.</p>
      <p>She was initially evaluated at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington before being transferred to Johns Hopkins for further evaluation and treatment of any possible infection.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg has been on the court since 1993, appointed by President Bill Clinton. Only Justice Clarence Thomas has served longer among the current members of the court.</p>
