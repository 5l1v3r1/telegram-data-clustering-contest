      <h2>Hannah Ryan, who works for the NHS, has lived in her Midland Heart property for nearly 30 years but a number of issues have recently piled up and are not being fixed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:43:17+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:43</time> by <a rel="author">Naomi de Souza</a></address>
      <p>An NHS nurse says she has to scoop poo of the toilet with her hands because of a blocked pipe at the rented home where she lives.</p>
      <p>Hannah Ryan is at breaking point with the bathroom leak also causing part of her ceiling to collapse sending water and waste cascading through her home.</p>
      <p>The 60-year-old has lived in her Midland Heart maintained property for 28 years, reports <a href="https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/you-find-dead-you-dont-17289674">Coventry Live</a> .</p>
      <p>But for the last four she says she has been complaining of a blocked pipe which has left her without a flushing toilet and having to scoop away waste with her hands.</p>
      <p>But after years of fighting, she has warned the landlord company they will find her dead if they're unable resolve her housing crisis.</p>

      <p>Miss Ryan works 12 hours shifts in her job as a nurse, and says she "just wants a home to come to."</p>
      <p>Miss Ryan and her daughter Kat Ryan, 30, spoke together to detail the issues.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Midland Heart apologised for the distress caused by the situation but stressed the property was safe to live in and that the ceiling would be repaired as a matter of priority.</p>
      <p>Miss Ryan and daughter Kat claim there have been "repeated failings" from Midland Heart to tackle the issues that could have caused the collapse.</p>
      <p>Miss Ryan said she "just doesn't know what to do anymore" and is worn down after years of trying to get help.</p>
      <p>She thinks the ceiling issues have stemmed from blocked waste pipes that lead from the bathroom, an issue which she says she has called Midland Heart about for the past four years.</p>

      <p>Miss Ryan has not had a flushing toilet for four years, and said: "I have had to put my hand down the toilet every time to dispose of the waste myself.</p>
      <p>"I can't go on like this."</p>
      <p>The blocked pipes are behind a persistent ceiling leak she believes,, which led to the whole ceiling collapse on Tuesday 19 November.</p>
      <p>Miss Ryan said: "I would really rather be at work than home. I work twelve hour shifts and just want a home to come back to.</p>
      <p>"I've been a good tenant, always paid my rent, I can't cope."</p>
      <p>Daughter Kat has come back from travelling the world to help her mum navigate what she describes as a "crisis."</p>
      <p>She said: "My mum has had a breakdown, she's had enough, she works 12 hour shifts at the local hospital four days a week, is on her feet all day, she just wants to live a simple life."</p>

      <p>As of Friday 22 November, Ms Ryan's says her house is not safe to live in, something Midland Heart disagreed with in a statement saying Miss Ryan is safe to remain in her home until the ceiling is repaired.</p>
      <p>So how did it get to this stage?  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>On Thursday 14 November Miss Ryan noticed her ceiling was leaking, the fourth time the ceiling has had to be repaired in recent years. Miss Ryan said every time the Midland Heart repair team came out they placed a board over the affected area.</li>
        <li>By Friday 15 November, the leak had got worse and asbestos was coming through the ceiling.  A repairman came out and Miss Ryan said it was recommended she "put a saucepan under the leak."</li>
        <li>By the morning of Monday 18 parts of the ceiling were falling down and landed around Miss Ryan while she was in the kitchen. The repair team arrived that morning, and put a black board over the hole, using masking tape and staples to secure.</li>
        <li>Miss Ryan and her daughter Kat were told by the Midland Heart team it was a “critical emergency” and someone would be there at 8am on Tuesday November 19. A plumber and electrician did arrive late that morning but according to Miss Ryan did not fix it the ceiling. Shortly after as daughter Kat was on the phone to Midland Heart the whole ceiling collapsed, and water and asbestos gushed in. The pair claim a contractor for Midland Heart stated they collected 12 bags of waste weighing 10kg each, which means 120kg had fallen from the ceiling.</li>
        <li>Ms Ryan and her daughter Kat state that on multiple occasions they have taken time off work and incurred financial losses to wait for workmen who have not showed up.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Miss Ryan detailed the severe emotional and physical toll the experience has taken on her.</p>
      <p>She said: "This whole thing is making me feel depressed. 28 years as a loyal customer and I get treated like I mean nothing.</p>
      <p>"I work full time so that I can pay for this house and for what? This isn’t the first dreadful experience I've had with Midland Heart, it’s one of many and I’m tired.</p>
      <p>"I have said to Midland Heart that they will find me dead if they don't get me out of here."</p>
      <p>Miss Ryan says Midland Heart have said they cannot provide a new ceiling until Tuesday 3 December.</p>
      <p>Daughter Kat said: "Midland Heart said all the waste pipes need replacing, which we had been telling them all along as the toilets have not flushed for the past four years.</p>
      <p>"They just put masking tape over the issue and don't actually solve it."</p>
      <p>Miss Ryan said on Friday she has since been offered help with bidding for a new, smaller property, and that the asbestos has been cleared.</p>
      <p>But she said: "I want someone from Head Office to come here and feel what it is like, to live this way. It has taken a huge toll on my mental and physical health."</p>
      <p>But for Miss Ryan, it has gone on long enough and says she has nothing left to fight with.</p>
      <p>"I'm not as strong as I used to be" she told us.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Midland Heart executive director of operations David Taylor said: "We’re very sorry for the distress caused to Ms Ryan by this leak and the resulting damage to the ceiling in her home.</p>
      <p>"She reported the repair to us quickly and a contractor was sent out, however because the ceiling is textured, which can contain asbestos, the works had to be put on hold until a qualified expert came to verify the ceiling was safe to work on.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“Sadly the leak, which had appeared to be contained, got worse in the meantime and caused the ceiling collapse. Our asbestos contractor has been out to remove the debris and carried out an air test, which was clear for asbestos fibres.</p>
      <p>“We will replace the whole ceiling as a matter of priority, and Ms Ryan is safe to remain in her home in the meantime.”</p>
      <p>The asbestos risk, the company said, stemmed from the use of artex ceilings in the property which are known to contain asbestos.</p>
      <p>Such ceilings are not licensed however as the amounts are too small.</p>
      <p>Midland Heart said it still takes proper precautions when cutting and disturbing such materials.</p>
      <p>On Miss Ryans efforts to downsize to a smaller property, Mr Taylor said: "“We can confirm that Ms Ryan contacted our customer hub to talk about downsizing, and was given advice on how to do this on our online portal, Homes Direct. She was also given details of some third party websites to try.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, while Ms Ryan created an account and filled in her details, she didn’t take the next step of choosing a property to apply for, so the system wasn’t able to flag that her current home is under-occupied.</p>
      <p>“We really appreciate Ms Ryan’s consideration for others who would benefit more from a three-bed property, so we’ve been in touch to guide her through the online application process.</p>
      <p>"We hope to be able to find her a more suitable new home soon, and free up a much-needed larger home for a local family.”</p>
