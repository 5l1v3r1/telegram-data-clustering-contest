      <h1>Brutal Weather Is Expected For The Cowboys-Patriots Game Today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T17:31:59+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 17:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Lambeau Field has been the sight of some of the coldest, snowiest games in NFL history. But Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts has been pretty brutal in the colder months, too.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, some of that brutal weather just so happens to be making its way to the stadium one of the most anticipated regular season games in years.</p>
      <p>The 6-4 Dallas Cowboys head to Foxborough today for a showdown with a 9-1 New England Patriots. But there’s trouble on the horizon.</p>
      <p>According to ESPN’s Todd Archer, rainy, windy weather is expected for this afternoon’s game. The forecast currently projects rain to last for the entire duration of the game.</p>

      <p>The miserable weather should certainly count as another advantage for the Patriots.</p>
      <p>Dallas plays all of their home games in the temperature-controlled confines of AT&amp;T Stadium. They have yet to play a game below 50 degrees Fahrenheit all season.</p>

      <p>But this game will be played between the mid-30s and low-40s.</p>
      <p>Will the weather play a major factor in the outcome of today’s big game?</p>
      <p>Patriots vs. Cowboys will be aired nationally on FOX. Kickoff is at 4:25 p.m. EST.</p>
