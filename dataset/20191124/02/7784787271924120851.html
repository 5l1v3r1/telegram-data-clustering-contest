      <h3>Jamie Whincup’s uncharacteristic error late in Race 31 at the Coates Hire Newcastle 500 boiled down to a “loss of concentration”.</h3>
      <p>For so long one of the sport’s benchmark operators, Whincup bowled a wide with 20 laps remaining while holding second behind Red Bull Holden Racing Team stablemate Shane van Gisbergen.</p>
      <p>Whincup, well down on van Gisbergen at the time, went down the escape road at Turn 1 and rejoined in seventh, before finishing eighth after losing a place to a resurgent Scott Pye.</p>

      <p>Prior to the error, the Red Bull Holden squad had cut the teams’ champion deficit to Shell V-Power Racing to 77 points. However, it blew out from 116 points to 143 points heading into Sunday’s Race 32 finale.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the race, Whincup explained the costly error.</p>
      <p>“I’m disappointed with what happened of course, but at the same time everyone makes mistakes at work,” he told the broadcast.</p>
      <p>“I just locked a wheel, I was sort of in no man’s land.</p>
      <p>“Shane was on a much better strategy and was always going to win the race, and I had comfortable gap to third.</p>
      <p>“Just lost a little bit of concentration and boom, that was the end of it.</p>
      <p>“Disappointing, I set a high expectation for myself, but we’ll fight back tomorrow.”</p>
      <p>Whincup rose to second after van Gisbergen fairly escorted second-placed starter Scott McLaughlin wide at Turn 1. The seven-time series champion then shadowed his teammate in the first stint before McLaughlin was short-fuelled and took the lead.</p>
      <p>Whincup stopped on Lap 16, nine laps after McLaughlin, before van Gisbergen was brought in on Lap 33. Van Gisbergen was then allowed through at Turn 11 on Lap 43, effectively putting Whincup back into second.</p>

      <p>However, within sight of the finish, Whincup made the mistake – but refused to attribute blame to anything other than himself.</p>
      <p>“My car was pretty good… it wasn't the fastest car out there, but it certainly wasn't the slowest, it was well good enough for second,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We pitted early, we knew the last stint was going to be tough, but the crew didn't expect me to spear it up the escape road and put me back in the pack.</p>
      <p>“Strategy was good, car pace was good enough, just driver made an error.”</p>
      <p>Despite admitting losing the one-two was a “bit of a shame”, van Gisbergen defended his teammate’s error.</p>
      <p>“That stuff happens when you’re just cruising not on the limit, you lose focus,” van Gisbergen explained.</p>
      <p>“It’s good to be comfortable out front, but I always start thinking about other stuff and slowing down.</p>
      <p>“That’s the hardest time, is to stay focused when you have got nothing to push for. It’s a real shame to make a mistake like that.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure he’ll be kicking himself and I’m sure he’ll come back stronger tomorrow. We have just got to do our job and be one-two tomorrow hopefully and see what happens to these guys.”</p>

      <p>With 288 points available on Sunday, the Shell Fords need only finish strongly to prevent the factory Holden squad ruining the drivers’-teams’-Bathurst triple in 2019.</p>
      <p>However, McLaughlin – who saw the drivers’ title slip away in controversial circumstances in Newcastle in 2017 – knows nothing is certain.</p>
      <p>“This whole weekend is purely teams’ [championship],” McLaughlin said.</p>
      <p>“It’s not done, if these guys finish one-two, we’ve got to be good… I think it’s like a top 10 or something like that.</p>
      <p>“Anything can happen. I know the hard way.”</p>
