      <p>At a time when various measures have failed to find a solution to stubble burning, scientists from Punjab Agriculture University (PAC) and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jawaharlal-nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> University (JNU) may hold a ray of hope: Biochar.</p>
      <p>Biochar is granular material obtained by heating crop residue at 400°C to 600°C in a kiln-shaped structure in the absence of oxygen. It is used as fertiliser to improve soil health and water-holding capacity of agriculture land.</p>
      <p>Rajeev Kumar Gupta, senior scientist at PAC, said biochar can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70%. “With help from ICAR a year ago, PAC set up structures at four Krishi Vigyan Kendras in Punjab to produce biochar. We’ve been demonstrating the technology to farmers.”</p>
      <p>He estimated that the project in Punjab may cost Rs 400-500 crore. In 2018-19, the Centre disbursed Rs 300 crore for in-situ management of stubble in Punjab. “Around 12,857 villages in Punjab burn stubble. Each village should have at least 5-8 structures,” he added.</p>
      <p>Each structure costs Rs 35,000-Rs 40,000 and is 10 ft in diametre and 14 ft in height. It can process 1.2 tonnes of stubble in 8-10 hours.</p>
      <p>JNU professor at School of Environmental Sciences, Dinesh Mohan, said: “Biomass contains many nutrients such as carbon. When you heat it, carbon gets sequestered in biochar, which gets transferred to soil.” Punjab Agriculture Secretary K S Pannu said: “We’re looking at economically viable technologies; biochar is one of them. More research is needed to take it to farmers.”</p>
