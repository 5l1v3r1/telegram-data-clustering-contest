      <h1>West Villager publicly shames dog, walker for making tree a ‘toilet’</h1>

      <p>This sidewalk squabble is no tiptoe through the tulips.</p>
      <p>A spring-bulbs-obsessed West Villager waged an all-out, all-caps war with a mystery dog walker — complete with a public shaming campaign over the pooch’s petal-imperiling poops.</p>
      <p>So incensed was the anonymous resident — and so infuriated by the feared fate of some recently-planted daffodils or crocuses — that a surveillance photo of the four-legged offender and his two-legged enabler has been posted at the site of the offense, accompanied by an all-upper-case screed.</p>
      <p>“WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!!!” the laminated lament begins.</p>
      <p>“OUR TREEWELL IS NOT YOUR TOILET,” it continues, still in caps but using red letters, for apparent emphasis.</p>

      <p>“YOU HAVE RUINED OUR SPRING BULBS AND LET YOUR DOG DEFECATE IN OUR TREEWELL TWICE THIS WEEK.”</p>
      <p>It concludes, “STOP AND GO SOMEPLACE ELSE AND GET SOME MANNERS!!!”</p>
      <p>Two complaint posters were pinned to either side of the trunk of an elm outside 260 W. 11th Street Friday.</p>
      <p>They included two time-stamped photos of the dog in mid-crouch within the treewell’s wrought iron fence, its female handler standing nearby.</p>
      <p>The mystery pair struck first on Oct. 16 around 11:15 p.m., the poster alleges, and returned days later.</p>
      <p>The display created a stir on the tourist-heavy block, home to celebrities including Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick — and sparked debate over who’s the bigger jerk in the decidedly first-world tiff: the ill-mannered dog walker or the tuber-defending tyrant.</p>
      <p>“I think they’re right! I mean, would you want a dog peeing and pooping in there?” a female West Village resident who declined to give her name said of whoever tacked up the posters.</p>
      <p>Others, mostly dog owners, sympathized with the mystery walker over the lack of bathroom space for city pups.</p>

      <p>“Dogs pee where they pee!” said Susan Massad, 81, who was walking her year-and-a-half-old dog, Louie, through the nabe Saturday. “I don’t think this kind of stuff actually works, a sign shaming people.”</p>
      <p>Property records show Eric Madoff, the Gov. Andrew Cuomo-appointed executive director and CEO of the New York State Insurance Fund, bought the three-story home in 2001 for $3 million. Neighbors said Madoff — no relation to Ponzi fraudster Bernie — lives in the home, now valued at an estimated $10 million.</p>
      <p>The dog walker’s identity remained a mystery on Saturday morning, by which time the posters had been removed.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s probably the person in the picture [who took it down]!” one Villager hypothesized on Saturday. “They’re probably thinking ‘Screw you! [My pet] can go anywhere!”</p>
      <p>Madoff could not be reached for comment.</p>
