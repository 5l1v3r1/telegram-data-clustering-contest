      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Devendra Fadnavis took oath as the CM with NCP's Ajit Pawar as his deputy</li>
        <li>Shiv Sena has launched a tirade against the stunning turn of events</li>
        <li>Sena has called Saturday's events as "politics of shamelessness"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Shiv Sena has launched a vicious attack on former allies and now rivals Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and called the spectacular turn of events in Maharashtra "shameless politics". Shiv Sena in its mouthpiece Saamana has said Sharad Pawar has been betrayed.</p>
      <p>In an early morning twist on Saturday, the President's rule was revoked in Maharashtra and <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/maharashtra-devendra-fadnavis-sharad-pawar-ajit-pawar-bjp-ncp-1621904-2019-11-23">Devendra Fadnavis was sworn-in as the chief minister with NCP's Ajit Pawar as his deputy</a>. Ajit Pawar broke away from Sharad Pawar's NCP and joined hands with BJP to take oath as the deputy chief minister.</p>
      <p>Even a few hours before this mega drama unfolded, Sharad Pawar had announced Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray as the CM face of the Sena-NCP-Congress alliance.</p>

      <p>In Saamana, Shiv Sena has said, "This is politics of shamelessness... Sharad Pawar has been betrayed".</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar's nephew Ajit Pawar, who was the legislature party leader of NCP, broke away from the party and pledged his support to BJP and Devendra Fadnavis in a stunning overnight coup that left everyone shocked.</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar was soon removed as the NCP legislature party leader. Sharad Pawar said the decision to side with Fadnavis was his nephew's personal choice and not that of the party.</p>
      <p>Reacting to his sacking, Shiv Sena has said, "12 ghante mein Ajit Pawar ke baje baara (Ajit Pawar has been destroyed in 12 hours)".</p>
      <p>"Ajit Pawar's wings have been cut off," Shiv Sena said. Shiv Sena has also called the turn of events a "farzikal strike".</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ajit-pawar-sidelined-ncp-cong-sena-knock-sc-door-against-maha-guv-top-developments-1622062-2019-11-23">Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP have now moved the Supreme Court</a> against Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari's move to swear-in Devendra Fadnavis as the chief minister in a hurried early morning event.</p>
      <p>The three parties have also said in their plea that there should be an immediate floor test in the Maharashtra assembly to avoid "horse trading" of MLAs.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP have also asked that the governor be directed to invite them to form government under the leadership of Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, saying they have the support of more than 144 MLAs.</p>
