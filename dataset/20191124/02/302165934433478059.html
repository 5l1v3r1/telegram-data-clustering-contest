      <p>INDIANAPOLIS, Nov 24 — Aaron Holiday bombed in a tie-breaking 3-pointer with 8.7 seconds remaining last night, giving the host Indiana Pacers a 111-106 victory over the Orlando Magic in a battle of injury-plagued teams.</p>
      <p>Domantas Sabonis went for 25 points for the Pacers, who managed to open a four-game homestand with a win despite missing Malcolm Brogdon, a pregame scratch because of a bad back, and Victor Oladipo, who is still rehabbing a knee injury.</p>
      <p>The Magic lost for a second straight time on a four-game trip after learning earlier in the day that they’d lost Nikola Vucevic for at least a week with a severely sprained right ankle. Forward Aaron Gordon, also bothered by an ankle injury, had to sit out the tightly contested game as well.</p>
      <p>The Magic fell behind by as many as 15 points in the first half and were down 55-45 at halftime before rallying into a 74-all tie with still 4:12 remaining in the third period.</p>
      <p>Indiana went on to reclaim as much as a seven-point advantage in the fourth period, but a hoop by Khem Birch got Orlando within 104-103 before Markelle Fultz created a 106-all tie with a dunk with 31.1 seconds left.</p>
      <p>Holiday then missed a jumper with 21.9 seconds to go, but Myles Turner retrieved the rebound for the Pacers and Holiday didn’t misfire on his second opportunity, nailing his difference-maker.</p>
      <p>The Magic had a chance to tie, but Justin Holiday stole the ball from Evan Fournier and was fouled, making two clinching free throws with 3.6 seconds left.</p>
      <p>Sabonis complemented his 25 points with a team-high nine rebounds and four assists for the Pacers, who won 109-102 at Orlando earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Lamb went for 14 points, Doug McDermott and Aaron Holiday 13 apiece, Justin Holiday 12 and Turner 10 for Indiana, which outshot Orlando 54.4 per cent to 46.7.</p>
      <p>Fournier had a game-high 26 points and Jonathan Isaac 25 for Orlando, which outscored Indiana 39-30 on 3-pointers. Fournier and Isaac hit four apiece.</p>
      <p>Fultz added 13 points, DJ Augustin 11 and Terrence Ross 10 for the Magic, who led by as many as seven in the first quarter. — Reuters</p>
