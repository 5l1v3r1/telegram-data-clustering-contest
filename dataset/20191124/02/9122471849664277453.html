      <h1>Scott Frost Has A Graphic Description About Illness The Huskers Dealt With</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T02:51:01+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 02:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>A trip to Maryland was just what the doctor ordered for Nebraska football. That is more literal than you’d assume, this week, as Scott Frost made very clear after the game.</p>
      <p>The Huskers entered today’s game riding a four-game losing streak. They took out frustrations on the struggling Terrapins, <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/scott-frost-reacts-nebraska-blowout-win-vs-maryland">winning 54-7</a>.</p>
      <p>That type of win against a conference foe is always pretty impressive. For Nebraska, it was even more so with the bug going around the locker room this week.</p>
      <p>After the game, Scott Frost didn’t downplay how sick some of his guys were, and made sure to drive home how impressive today’s result was because of it.</p>

      <p>From the clip:</p>
      <blockquote>“When I say they were sick, they were… they were coming out both sides. We didn’t know if we were gonna have them, and it says a lot about how tough they are.”</blockquote>
      <p>Gross! Thanks Coach!</p>
      <p>Adrian Martinez threw for 194 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception, and led the way on the ground with 10 carries for 94 yards and a score. Luke McCaffrey also showed off his dual-threat abilities in garbage time, throwing for 32 yards and adding 83 and a score on the ground. As a team, the Huskers ran for 305 yards.</p>
      <p>The win puts Nebraska at 5-6 for the season, setting up a battle for bowl eligibility next weekend. The Huskers host Iowa on Friday afternoon, with a chance to get that all-important sixth win for the first time under Scott Frost. The No. 17 Hawkeyes outlasted a spunky Illinois team, winning the game 19-10 in Iowa City.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401112200">ESPN’s Football Power Index</a> gives Iowa a 78.5-percent chance to pull out a road victory.</p>
