      <p>EDMONTON -- A horse owner is expressing her gratitude after firefighters and volunteers helped rescue one of her horses when it fell through ice and was trapped in freezing water for hours.  </p>
      <p>Natalia Teplova noticed her horse, Lexi, was missing Saturday morning when she showed up at a boarder's property in southeast Edmonton for a lesson.  </p>
      <p>"We went calling for the horses and usually they come up. This time, the other horses came up but she wasn't there," Teplova recalled.</p>
      <p>She and her husband formed a small search party to check the rest of the property, and had almost given up looking for the animal when the horse her husband was riding called out—and Lexi responded.</p>
      <p>"Then he called again and she responded again, and I started running," Teplova said.</p>
      <p>They found the horse nearly fully submerged at the edge of a slough.</p>
      <p>"Her head was sticking out above the ice. She was submerged all the way to her withers—her shoulders. Her front feet were out. She was barely holding up there."</p>
      <p>Teplova called for help from others at the boarding property, as well as the owner. First, they slid some ropes around Lexi's body so she didn't sink further.</p>
      <p>"I put my hands in just to get the ropes around, in the water, and within seconds, my hand went numb. So that was very, very cold," Teplova said.</p>
      <p>They also called 911, prompting response from several firefighting units.</p>
      <p>Together, rescuers wrapped a sling around Lexi and pulled her out with a bobcat.</p>
      <p>By then, the horse had become mostly unresponsive. As she was put onto rescue float and pulled into the yard, Lexi was covered in blankets and checked by a veterinarian who said she was suffering from shock and hypothermia.</p>
      <p>Although Lexi would later stand and begin moving around again, Teplova said Lexi is still recovering. She was in the water for at least six hours, it was estimated.</p>
      <p>"We still have a battle ahead, trying to make sure she survives," her owner commented. The concern now is any effect Lexi experience from muscle wasting or poor circulation.</p>
      <p>However, Teplova is hopeful—and overwhelmed with thanks to those at the property and emergency responders who helped.</p>
      <p>"I'm so grateful they were able to make it here. Just hearing their sirens in the back, when they were approaching the property was a big relief."</p>
      <p>Acccording to Teplova, the boarded horses often roam around the water—during the summer and winter—but that the ice wasn't thick enough to support the animal yet.</p>
