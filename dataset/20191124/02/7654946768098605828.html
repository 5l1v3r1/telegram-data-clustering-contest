      <h1>Rudy Giuliani: Joe Biden is ‘like Kay Corleone’ in impeachment drama</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T02:53:45+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 02:53</time> by <a rel="author">Mary Kay Linge</a></address>
      <p>It’s business, but this man is taking it very personal.</p>
      <p>Rudy Giuliani channeled Mario Puzo Saturday as he ridiculed Joe Biden for insisting that he never knew of son Hunter’s business entanglements in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>“It’s like a poor imitation of ‘The Godfather,’” Giuliani told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8WJtT3vINE">Fox News</a>.</p>
      <p>“He says, ‘I don’t know my own family’s business’ — some of it sounds like Kay Corleone,” he added, referring to the pivotal scene in which a mob wife willfully blinds herself to her Mafia-boss husband’s crimes.</p>
      <p>“He’d have to be a fool,” Giuliani said.</p>
      <p>The former mayor, Trump’s personal lawyer, has pushed a narrative claiming that Hunter Biden reaped illicit profits in Ukraine while his father served as President Barack Obama’s No. 2.</p>
      <p>“I did the right thing. I represented my client in a very, very effective way,” Giuliani said.</p>
      <p>Biden lashed out at Senate Republicans Friday for their plans to investigate his son’s Ukraine dealings, saying he is “embarrassed” for Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>
      <p>“Lindsey is about to go down in a way that I think he’s going to regret his whole life,” <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/23/rudy-giuliani-joe-bidens-jab-at-lindsey-graham-reminds-me-of-a-mafia-case/">Biden told CNN</a>, in response to news that Graham asked the State Department for documents about the Bidens and Burisma, a company that hired Hunter Biden for a cushy job in 2014.</p>
      <p>“They have him under their thumb right now,” Biden continued. “If he comes out against Trump, he’s got a real tough road for reelection.”</p>
      <p>But it’s not just Graham.</p>
      <p>GOP Sens. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Ron Johnson, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, are seeking Treasury Department records on accusations that Hunter Biden was involved with money laundering or fraud in connection with Burisma, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment-biden/us-republican-senators-ask-treasury-for-any-reports-on-hunter-biden-idUSKBN1XW254">Reuters reported Friday.</a></p>
      <p>Trump’s Senate allies are gearing up for the impeachment trial that Trump insists he wants — in which he could demand testimony from both Bidens on their involvement in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and other Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee will huddle over Congress’s Thanksgiving break to write up the results of their impeachment hearings.</p>

      <p>They are expected to hand their report over to Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) and the Judiciary Committee in early December for a new round of hearings — and, potentially, the production of formal articles of impeachment.</p>
      <p>But some Republicans say that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could pull the plug on her party’s impeachment efforts as poll numbers among independent voters crumble.</p>
      <p>Independents now oppose impeachment by 49% to 34% – a 15-point margin — in a poll that saw those voters supporting it by 48-39 in October.</p>
      <p>“There’s a growing school of thought that rather give Senate Republicans or the White House an opportunity on a level playing field on a large stage, Democrats would be better off just … hav[ing] a vote of censure-ship,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) told The Hill Saturday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, State Department documents released late Friday <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/23/calls-revealed-between-giuliani-pompeo-weeks-before-yovanovitch-ouster-watchdog-group/">confirmed two phone calls</a> between Giuliani and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in March, weeks before Trump ousted former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.</p>
      <p>Yovanovitch’s firing is a central focus of the House’s impeachment inquiry.</p>
