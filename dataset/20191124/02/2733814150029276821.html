      <p>Long-time Slashdot reader <a href="https://hardware.slashdot.org/~50000BTU_barbecue">50000BTU_barbecue</a> likes using vintage computers from the 1980s and early 1990s -- " real hardware with all the weirdness that goes with it."<br/><br/>But what do you do for a monitor? Especially when "old CRTs are starting to lose sharpness and brightness and may get tossed or damaged when moving..." <i>We still use the same electrical plugs, and keyboards and joysticks are still similar-looking. But display devices have become these enormous high-resolution devices with fewer and fewer analog inputs... The solution is to use some sort of video upscaler. <br/><br/>There are many devices offered, from cheap Chinese units for about $10 to old professional studio scalers from 10-20 years ago. The Chinese units have no controls and are quite variable in the results obtained. But they're cheap. The old scalers would deliver professional results but are not guaranteed to work with consumer monitors or lock onto the non-standard timings of the non-interlaced "240p" video common on 8-bit computers.<br/><br/>What device do you use?</i> <br/>Leave your own thoughts and suggestions in the comments. How can you use modern displays with vintage computing hardware?</p>
