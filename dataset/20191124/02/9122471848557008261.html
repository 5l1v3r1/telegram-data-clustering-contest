      <h1>Miami Fans Are Freaking Out About The Halftime Score vs. FIU</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T02:03:09+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 02:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Miami isn’t the dominant program it once was, but the Hurricanes still have the talent year-in and year-out to make some noise in the ACC. The effort they’re putting forth against FIU on Saturday, however, is making some lose faith in the program.</p>
      <p>Miami, which has a 6-4 record on the year, is currently getting shut out by FIU, a 5-5 team from Conference USA. At halftime, the score is 13-0. The Hurricanes are getting mocked mercilessly on social media as a result.</p>
      <p>Miami quarterback Jarren Williams is just 5-of-10 for 78 yards with an interception so far. FIU signal-caller James Morgan, meanwhile, is 13-of-20 for 125 yards with a touchdown.</p>
      <p>The Hurricanes have been thoroughly dominated in every phase of the game so far. Fans of the program are melting down.</p>

      <p>There’s also a developing story with the Hurricanes. Tate Martell, who transferred in from Ohio State this past offseason, <a href="https://thespun.com/acc/miami-fl/tate-martell-is-not-at-miamis-game-tonight">is not with the team for the game.</a></p>
      <p>Of course, it’s only halftime. Miami could easily stage a comeback and win handily. But this still isn’t a great look for a program that wants to be competing for national titles.</p>
      <p>The second half is about to get underway. You can imagine that head coach Manny Diaz had quite the speech at halftime for his players.</p>
