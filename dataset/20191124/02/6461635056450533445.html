      <h1>Brazilian prodigy reveals possibility of a Barcelona return</h1>

      <h3><a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2019/11/23/5dd985b5268e3eb94a8b4584.html"><b>Marca</b></a> reports that Malcom has received messages about the possibility of a return to the Spanish club, just after one year since his departure.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://everythingbarca.com/2019/08/04/malcom-fund-barcelona-reinforcement/"><b>Malcom</b></a> joined Barcelona from Bordeaux in 2018 for a fee of 41 million euros. He made 24 appearances for the Catalonia side, racking up 4 goals in the process, including goals against Inter and Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>A year later, Zenit St. Petersburg spent 40 million euros on the winger. The Brazilian has only managed to make two appearances for the Russian side this season as he has been out with an injury since the very beginning of the campaign.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old left Barca in the summer but has now revealed the possibility of a reunion in the future.</p>
      <blockquote>“I can say that I receive messages about returning to Barcelona,” Malcom said in an interview with RMC Sport.</blockquote>
      <p>The forward only managed a season with the Catalonia giants but claims he does not regret his decision,</p>
      <blockquote> ” My season at Barca? No, I don’t regret it. I am young, I want to play, anywhere, because I like football, so I want to play and it was Zenit that gave me the opportunity to play football.</blockquote>
      <p>The Brazilian recalled his time at Spain, stating he did everything he was asked to do by coach Valverde,</p>
      <blockquote>“Every time the coach gave me an opportunity to play, I did my job and I think I did it well. That’s why the Barcelona fans love me.”</blockquote>
      <p>It will be very unlikely that the youngster will join Blaugrana in 2020, especially considering it was Valverde who let go of the Brazilian winger in the first place and that his Zenit contract runs until 2024.</p>
      <p>Would Malcom’s return solve Barca’s attacking problems?</p>
