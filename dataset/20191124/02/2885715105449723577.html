      <p>Eight out of 10 traffic rule violators in <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> have not paid the fines slapped on them, as per the figures provided by the branch of the traffic police that issues challans. The fines pertain to violations that took place in last one and a half years. The traffic police sent out the Traffic Violation Information Slips (TVIS) in two tranches in June and August this year followed by a reminder earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The TVIS were issued between April, 2018 and November, 2019 on the basis of 95 CCTV cameras which are installed across Chandigarh to detect the traffic violations.</p>
      <p>As many as 63,183 violators were sent such messages during the last five months, out of which only 12,799 have responded and paid the amount, while 50,384 violators were yet to respond.</p>
      <p>As many as 21,888 messages were sent on June 27 and in response 3376 postal challans were paid. On August 7, 41,295 messages were sent and out of this, 7,452 violators paid the fine amount. Recently, Reminder messages were sent to 52,355 violators on November 13 and 1,971 of them paid the amount.</p>
      <p>A traffic police challaning branch officer said, “The violators are from Chandigarh, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, New Delhi, Gujarat, and other states. Maximum TVIS— around 25,100— were issued for violations like parking over zebra crossing. Other violations include jumping red signal, riding without helmet, registration number plate missing, triple riding on two-wheeler. In fact, violators from other states like New Delhi, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh shown positive response and paid the fines. But most of the violators are yet to pay the fine.”</p>
      <p>DSP (traffic) Kewal Krishan said they are going to take strict action against those who have not paid the fine yet.</p>
      <p>“A traffic violator against whom a challan will be pending, will never obtain the no-objection-certificate (NOC) from the concerning RLA for selling the vehicle further. If five challans are pending against a motor vehicle, traffic police will be entitled to impound the vehicle from the owner’s house. Criminal proceedings will be initiated against the violators while forwarding the challans to the local courts,” the DSP said.</p>
      <p>“Traffic police challaning branch is connected with all the RLAs through E-vahan mobile applications. The registration number of vehicles caught while violating the traffic rules will be forwarded to the concerning RLAs along with the traffic violations slips,” he added.</p>
