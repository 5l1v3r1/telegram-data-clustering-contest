      <h1>Raheem Sterling's hilarious response to disallowed VAR goal in Man City victory</h1>
      <h2>Sterling jokes he is 'cursed' after injury-time effort in City's 2-1 win over Chelsea is ruled out in latest Premier League VAR controversy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T02:55:52+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 02:55</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Raheem Sterling joked that he was "happy to improve my VAR overruled goals record" after his latest effort was chalked out in Manchester City's 2-1 win over <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> .</p>
      <p>Sterling thought he made the game safe for City when he poked home in injury time at the Etihad amid Chelsea's efforts to earn a last-ditch equaliser.</p>
      <p>But the effort was disallowed after VAR ruled that Sterling was offside when the ball was headed forward to him.</p>
      <p>The ruling was by the narrowest of margins, with TV replays showing Sterling may actually have been level.</p>
      <p>Sterling afterwards tweeted about his disallowed effort, joking that he was "cursed" by VAR.</p>

      <p>The 24-year-old wrote: "Happy to improve my VAR overruled goals record today again. Damn this thing gonna kill me bro #cursed."</p>
      <p>Sterling also had a goal disallowed in City's 5-0 win over <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on the opening day of the Premier League season.</p>
      <p>But much more crucially, he also had one chalked off during City's Champions League semi-final defeat to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> last season.</p>
      <p>City <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/man-city-2-1-chelsea-20945552">held on for the victory</a> on Saturday, courtesy of goals from Kevin de Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez after N'Golo Kante had fired Chelsea ahead.</p>

      <p>And Roy Keane said Pep Guardiola's team had "responded like champions" to going behind in the first half.</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> responded like champions today," Keane said on Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"They weren't quite at their best but they punished Chelsea for their mistakes and they deserved to win. We saw the quality they have, even with their problems."</p>
      <p>Beating Chelsea was the perfect way for City to respond after losing to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> to fall nine points behind the Premier League leaders just before the international break.</p>

      <p>And Keane said: "Pep would've wanted a reaction from the game a couple of weeks ago.</p>
      <p>"They've got quality and vast experience and a brilliant coach.</p>
      <p>"I still think he's hurt by that game, there was always going to be a reaction and when they got the equaliser there was no doubt for me they were going to go on and win."</p>
