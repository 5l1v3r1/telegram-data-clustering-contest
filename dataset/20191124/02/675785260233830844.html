      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Karl McCartney's social media activity was exposed by anti-fascist campaign group Hope Not Hate - in which he shared messages from Katie Hopkins that she supported Tommy Robinson</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T02:00:28+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 02:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alan Selby, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>A Tory candidate retweeted a post claiming Tommy Robinson had been imprisoned for 'reporting on Muslim paedophiles'.</p>
      <p>Karl McCartney apparently endorsed the comment which said the Government had 'made it illegal' to expose Asian grooming gangs after Robinson was jailed for contempt of court.</p>
      <p>The revelations come five years after Mr McCartney claimed his account had been hacked after it was revealed his favourite pics included bondage images.</p>
      <p>Mr McCartney, who is standing in Lincoln having been the city’s MP between 2010 and 2017, also shared a letter from Tommy Robinson with his followers in which the extreme right-winger claimed his murder by Islamic prison gangs would spark a revolution.</p>
      <p>It read: “I’ve always said I’d sacrifice my life tomorrow if it would end the Islamic takeover of our beautiful land.”</p>

      <p>He also shared messages from Katie Hopkins in which she supported Robinson and said he had been unfairly imprisoned for exposing Asian rape gangs.</p>
      <p>His social media activity was uncovered by campaign group Hope Not Hate whose chief executive Nick Lowles said Mr McCartney should be sacked.</p>
      <p>“There’s no excuse for promoting far-right propaganda. Karl McCartney is utterly unfit to be an MP,” he said.</p>
      <p>Liberal Democrat MP Antoinette Sandbach said: "Perhaps the Conservatives should spend less time dividing the country and more time scrutinising their candidates."</p>

      <p>Mr McCartney said: “I apologise unreservedly. In no way do I endorse the tweets or the accounts behind them. I accept retweeting them was ill-judged and could cause offence.</p>
      <p>"This divisive figure has no place in our politics or public life.”</p>
      <p>He is hoping to unseat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> ’s Karen Lee, who beat him in 2017 by 1,538 votes.</p>
