      <h1>Reporter Says Tom Herman Looked “Broken” After Texas’ Loss To Baylor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T02:21:43+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 02:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Texas is back? Not this season. The Longhorns fell to 6-5 after their 24-10 loss to the Baylor Bears on Saturday. This certainly isn’t the season most fans were expecting – preseason aspirations anticipated a much higher ceiling.</p>
      <p>Tom Herman’s team is playing worse than its overall talent indicates. The Longhorns are in danger of finishing the regular season with six wins and six losses – next Saturday’s test against Texas Tech won’t be easy.</p>
      <p>Herman will have to regroup quickly to get his players and staff motivated for next week’s game. But first things first, the Texas head coach will have to re-motivate himself.</p>
      <p>According to a report, Herman was “broken” during his post-game presser.</p>

      <p>This might spell trouble for the Longhorns. A Big 12 title is out of the question. But a loss to the Red Raiders next Saturday would be disastrous.</p>
      <p>If Texas hopes to carry any momentum into the off-season, the Longhorns must take care of business the rest of the way. As for Herman, he’ll have to find new ways to motivate his team other than <a href="https://thespun.com/big-12/texas-longhorns/tom-herman-headbutt-texas-baylor">head-butting players with helmets on</a>.</p>
      <p>There’s no doubt Texas has dealt with plenty of injuries this season. But the measure of a team is how it responds to adversity.</p>
      <p>How will Texas respond next Saturday?</p>
