      <p>Telly chef Gino D’Acampo has told how fans flocked round Gordon Ramsay like he was Elvis Presley.</p>
      <p>Gino spent a month in America with the Kitchen Nightmares chef filming their joint ITV series which also stars Channel 4’s First Dates star Fred Sirieix.</p>
      <p>And he was stunned by how Gordon was mobbed like the Return To Sender singer as they filmed for Gordon, Gino and Fred: Road Trip.</p>
      <p>Gino, 43, said: “Gordon is treated like Elvis out there. He’s a king. People came up to us everywhere we went. It was insane.”</p>
      <p>Gordon, 53, has become a household name in the US after stateside ­versions of his Kitchen Nightmares, Hell’s Kitchens and Hotel Hell shows.</p>

      <p>But there were no feelings of jealousy between the trio.</p>
      <p>After travelling around Europe for the last series, they explored places such as Las Vegas, LA, Texas, Mexico, Dallas and San Francisco.</p>

      <p>Gino said: “It took our bond to a ­different level. We’re brothers.</p>
      <p>“Fred cried when we left. We didn’t want it to end.”</p>
      <p>Gino missed his buddies when he filmed Gino’s Italian Express earlier this year, in which he went round his country of birth by train, trying the local delicacies.</p>
      <p>But the trio will reunite next year for a holiday in Sardinia with their families.</p>
