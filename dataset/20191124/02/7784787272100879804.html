      <h1>Van Gisbergen wins Newcastle opener as Whincup throws away Red Bull one-two</h1>

      <h3>Shane van Gisbergen continued the Red Bull Holden Racing Team’s good form from the enduros to convert pole to victory in Race 31 at the Coates Hire Newcastle 500.</h3>
      <p>It loomed to be a sparkling Saturday for the factory Holden squad as Jamie Whincup held second behind van Gisbergen for much of the race, before he made a critical late error to hand P2 to champion-elect Scott McLaughlin.</p>
      <p>Whincup’s error cost RBHRT valuable ground as the Holden outfit looks to steal the teams’ championship away from the Shell V-Power Racing Team.</p>

      <p>Van Gisbergen escorted McLaughlin wide at the first turn after the start, helping Whincup slot into second to complete a RBHRT quinella.</p>
      <p>As van Gisbergen held firm, Whincup kept the #97 honest as McLaughlin retained station in third. The champion was brought in on Lap 7 and was short-fuelled, and once Whincup (Lap 16) and van Gisbergen stopped (Lap 33), McLaughlin emerged in the lead.</p>
      <p>Van Gisbergen, having taken a longer stop, dropped to third but quickly caught the rear of his teammate’s ZB Commodore, with McLaughlin unable to create a gap.</p>
      <p>On Lap 43, Whincup moved aside to let van Gisbergen through into Turn 11, and the 2016 series champion set off after his countryman.</p>

      <p>McLaughlin stopped on Lap 50, and Whincup followed him a lap later, the latter retaking effective second.</p>
      <p>Trying to build a gap, having found clean air, van Gisbergen was pushing hard and screeched for blue flags at every chance.</p>
      <p>On Lap 65, van Gisbergen stopped and emerged with a comfortable gap, and with the RBHRT teammates first and second, the deficit between the leading two teams had been slashed to 77 points.</p>
      <p>However, an uncharacteristic error from Whincup at Turn 1 on Lap 75 sent the seven-time champion tumbling to seventh.</p>
      <p>Van Gisbergen held a 13-second lead over McLaughlin with five laps remaining, and as the weather closed in on Newcastle, teams readied wet weather tyres in case of a late deluge.</p>

      <p>However, despite the dark clouds forming over the city, the weather remained clear as van Gisbergen cruised to his fifth win of the season.</p>
      <p>McLaughlin led home teammate Fabian Coulthard to help the Ford squad put one hand on the teams’ gong, with Whincup slumping to eighth.</p>
      <p>David Reynolds (#9 Penrite Racing ZB Commodore) and Cameron Waters (#6 Monster Energy Mustang) completed the top five ahead of Scott Pye, who made a brilliant recovery from 24th to sixth following a crash in qualifying.</p>
      <p>James Courtney trailed home his Walkinshaw Andretti United teammate to seventh ahead of Whincup, with Tim Slade (#14 Freightliner Racing ZB Commodore) and Mark Winterbottom (#18 IRWIN Racing ZB Commodore) completing the top 10.</p>

      <p>With the win, van Gisbergen sealed second in the drivers’ standings.</p>
      <p>“Awesome day for us, shame about Jamie making a mistake there, that would’ve been great team points,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Thanks to the guys, the car was awesome. I had a cool start, good battle and then forced our way through, so pretty cool.</p>
      <p>“Thanks to Shippy [engineer Grant McPherson] for tuning that up in qualifying, that set us up for the win, because you simply just can’t pass here.</p>
      <p>“Caught up in the middle stint and then you just get stuck behind. Great strategy to get us the win, that was all a team effort.”</p>
      <p>Considering the pace of the factory Holdens, McLaughlin admitted Whincup’s error gifted his team a two-three finish, but was pleased to keep the teams’ championship fight in the Shell team’s corner heading to Sunday.</p>
      <p>“It’s tough around here, it’s quite hard work,” McLaughlin said.</p>
      <p>“Great job for everyone at Shell V-Power Racing, two and three, obviously Jamie made a mistake there and gifted us a double podium, but I’m sure they’ll come back strong tomorrow.</p>
      <p>“Overall, a great team result.”</p>
