        <b>Winner of titles in Portugal and Saudi Arabia, Jorge Jesus savoured Flamengo’s 2-1 win over River Plate.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Flamengo head coach Jorge Jesus described his side’s Copa Libertadores triumph as “the most important title of my career”.</p>
      <p>Two goals in three minutes from Gabriel ‘Gabigol’ Barbosa saw Flamengo snatch a 2-1 victory over defending champions River Plate in Lima on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Flamengo were trailing to Rafael Santos Borre’s first-half strike, until Gabriel equalised in the 89th minute and netted the winner three minutes later.</p>
      <p>A three-time league champion with Benfica, while he also claimed silverware at Braga, Sporting CP and Al Hilal, Jesus revelled in the achievement.</p>
      <p>“It’s the most important title of my career,” Jesus said post-game. “The Copa Libertadores is for South America what the Champions League is for Europe.</p>
      <p>Any of the teams in the continent could have won it. Now we will try to win the Brazilian Serie A, but this is undoubtedly the most important trophy.”</p>

      <p>Jesus arrived at Flamengo in June and the Brazilian side are 26 games unbeaten in all competitions as they also close in on Campeonato Brasileiro glory.</p>
      <p>“When I decided to come to Flamengo a lot of people didn’t agree with me, including my friends and my agent,” Jesus added.</p>
      <p>“But I made my own decision to come without being influenced by others. If we win the Club World Cup, it will be the best year of my career.”</p>
      <p>Jesus has been linked to LaLiga champions Barcelona, but the 65-year-old Portuguese boss said: “I feel very good at Flamengo. I’ve made many friends in Brazil and the people have always treated me very well.”</p>
      <p>It was Flamengo’s first Libertadores title since 1981 and Gabriel – on loan from Serie A side Inter – added: “Flamengo have to win the Brasileirao, win the Club World Cup…”</p>
