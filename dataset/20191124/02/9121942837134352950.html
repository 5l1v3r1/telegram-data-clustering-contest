      <p>ROME (AP) — Italian news reports say the coast guard has recovered the bodies of seven migrants near Lampedusa, an island south of Sicily.</p>
      <p>The coast guard, aided by border police boats, kept us a search Sunday of rough seas for as many as 13 other migrants feared missing after their boat capsized Saturday.</p>
      <p>RAI state radio and the ANSA news agency, reporting from the Italian island, said seven bodies were carried ashore, including the body of a woman.</p>
      <p>Authorities said 149 migrants were rescued after the boat overturned. Survivors told authorities that 169 had been originally aboard.</p>
      <p>The coast guard said a private citizen alerted it on Saturday that a boat was foundering. The vessel, tossed by three-meter-(10-feet)-high waves, then overturned.</p>
      <p>Migrants set out on unseaworthy boats launched by Libya-based human traffickers.</p>
