      <h1>Democrat's defection reverberates in Pennsylvania's Senate</h1>

      <p><b>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP)</b> - As Pennsylvania state senators filed through the tight, wood-paneled corridor that leads out of the Senate chamber this week, John Yudichak turned into an equally tight staircase that no Democrat ever takes: down to the Senate Republican majority caucus room.</p>
      <p>Yudichak will take those stairs a lot now that he has left the Democratic Party after two decades in the Legislature to become a registered independent who is joining the Senate's Republican majority caucus.</p>
      <p>And while Yudichak described his defection as an effort to empower the political middle, it reverberated swiftly in the Capitol and through the state's politics as something else.</p>
      <p>To many, it dealt a blow to Democratic hopes of capturing the chamber's majority in next year's election for the first time in nearly three decades.</p>
      <p>"What I can say is, this absolutely takes away any chance for Senate Democrats to gain control of the Senate chamber," said the Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati, R-Jefferson.</p>
      <p>To others, Yudichak's defection underscored the political realignment in Pennsylvania accelerated by Donald Trump's stunning 2016 win in the presidential battleground state.</p>
      <p>Yudichak's own Luzerne County was the poster child for Trump's victory in Pennsylvania, when the county and the state backed a Republican presidential candidate for the first time since 1988.</p>
      <p>Yudichak, 49, a moderate pro-labor descendant of unionized coal miners, is now the Senate's only registered independent ever on record, Senate officials say.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the year, Yudichak began talking to a friend and contemporary, Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman, R-Centre, about his career and, in September, floated the idea of becoming an independent and joining the Republican caucus.</p>
      <p>"It was his suggestion, he asked," Corman said. "He said, ‘You know, if I switched to an independent, would I be welcome in your caucus?' and I said, ‘Of course you would be.'"</p>
      <p>In making his announcement Tuesday, Yudichak blamed a corrosive "Us vs. Them" political world and maintained that his move wasn't personal or about a single event.</p>
      <p>Still, he said he would continue to support and fundraise for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 race for president, as well as Democratic candidates whose interests align with his.</p>
      <p>But he characterized the Democratic Party and the Senate's Democratic caucus as increasingly less tolerant of issues that are important to him.</p>
      <p>Many inside the Democratic caucus accused Yudichak of betraying his roots.</p>
      <p>"Something else is going on here," said Sen. Vincent Hughes, D-Philadelphia. "I don't know what it is, but it is going on."</p>
      <p>Perhaps for Yudichak the writing was on the wall.</p>
      <p>As a northeastern Pennsylvania product, Yudichak had no prospect at becoming the Democrats' floor leader in a caucus with a decidedly more liberal powerbase from Philadelphia and its suburbs.</p>
      <p>Then there's Yudichak's district.</p>
      <p>It has a solid Democratic registration advantage, but it bears the hallmarks of Trump country: it is whiter, with lower median incomes and lower rates of college-degree attainment, than the rest of Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>Many Democrats saw cold political calculation in Yudichak's decision.</p>
      <p>Sen. John Blake, D-Lackawanna, called it a "a selfish political bait-and-switch."</p>
      <p>"I understand the calculus of it and I understand John to be an ambitious politician, so maybe he's trying to set himself up for something in the future," Blake said.</p>
      <p>Luzerne County's Democratic Party chairman John Pekarovsky, who is also Yudichak's campaign treasurer, was stunned. But, he said, he saw no selfish political motive for a politician who didn't even have an opponent in his 2014 and 2018 re-election bids.</p>
      <p>"John is so popular in our area," Pekarovsky said.</p>
      <p>Including Yudichak, Republicans are counting on a 29-21 Senate majority going into next year's election, when Senate Democrats hope to harness an anti-Trump backlash in heavily populated suburbs.</p>
      <p>Democrats now must capture four seats - instead of three - to capture a majority with Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman as the tie-breaking vote.</p>
      <p>That means Democrats are moving a Lancaster-based seat into the must-win category along with seats anchored in Erie, Harrisburg and Delaware County.</p>
      <p>Democrats may even get help from Yudichak.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the day before Yudichak announced he was leaving the Democratic Party, Yudichak asked Pekarovsky to cut two campaign checks.</p>
      <p>Both were for Senate Democrats running for re-election next year, including one - Jim Brewster of Allegheny County - who Republicans are gunning for.</p>
