      <h1>Dean Smith urges Aston Villa fans to respect Steve Bruce</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dean-smith/"><b>Dean Smith</b></a> believes <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/steve-bruce/"><b>Steve Bruce</b></a> deserves respect when he returns to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/aston-villa/"><b>Aston Villa</b></a> on Monday after ending his days at the club with a cabbage being thrown at him and the sack.</h2>

      <p>Bruce spent two years in charge at Villa Park, losing his job last October, just over four months after a defeat to Fulham in the Sky Bet Championship play-off final at Wembley.</p>
      <p>Bruce's final game at the helm was a 3-3 draw with then bottom-club Preston at Villa Park, with Villa throwing away a 2-0 lead and relying on a late equaliser to salvage a point.</p>
      <p>With Villa on a run of one win in 10 matches prior to the game, one fan opted to hurl a cabbage at Bruce – rather than verbal abuse – to express his disgust at his performance as boss.</p>
      <p>Bruce returns to Villa for the first time since his dismissal as his Newcastle side take on Smith's outfit.</p>
      <p>"I thought it was a disgrace," said Smith when asked about the cabbage incident. "You don't want to see that in the ground. I said that at the time."</p>
      <p>Expressing credit for Bruce's achievements, Smith said: "I said when I took the job that I have an awful lot of respect for what he has done in management but, more importantly, for how he is as a man as well.</p>
      <p>"This season, if you look at Newcastle at the start, there were a lot of questions about the club and where it was going. But Steve has gone in and done what he does best – got them organised.</p>
      <p>"They've got pace and power up front. They are winning games – they've won the last couple – and they beat Manchester United at home as well. They are in a good run of form at the moment."</p>
      <p>Smith was particularly impressed with Newcastle's last away performance, a 3-2 win at West Ham courtesy of a devastating display of counter-attacking which saw them romp into a 3-0 lead before conceding two late goals.</p>
      <p>"It could have been five or six, such is the pace and power they've got in their team," assessed Smith. "They were outstanding in their counter-attacking.</p>
      <p>"They've got really good organisation as well. They're tough to break down, but a real threat on the counter."</p>
      <p>Smith's Villa had issues coping with Wolves' counter-attacking threat in their last match prior to the international break, a lethargic 2-1 defeat that has left the club just above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Despite injury woes going into, and during that game, Smith is hoping there will be no repeat of such a sorry display.</p>
      <p>"Our last performance away wasn't so good and the players certainly got a reminder of that," said Smith.</p>
      <p>"We had a debrief about Wolves. We picked out some things that we have to get better at, collectively, and the players know they have to do better individually."</p>
      <p>Smith has captain <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jack-grealish/"><b>Jack Grealish</b></a> fit again after a four-week lay-off with a calf injury, while goalkeeper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tom-heaton/"><b>Tom Heaton</b></a> should also return after missing the Wolves defeat with his own calf problem.</p>
      <p>Defenders <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/matt-targett/"><b>Matt Targett</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/bjorn-engels/"><b>Bjorn Engels</b></a> also come into contention after the former was taken off just after the break at Molineux with concussion, while the latter missed the game with a hip injury.</p>
