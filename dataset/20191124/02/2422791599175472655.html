      <p>Toronto police say they weren't able to find a man who had reportedly been walking around the downtown area and swinging an axe.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/TPSOperations/status/1198381213544787975">They say the man was yelling at people</a> on Saturday evening and striking garages with the large axe.</p>
      <p>They say he then started swinging it at transit poles.</p>
      <p>Const. David Hopkinson says the man had been moving through the downtown area fairly quickly.</p>
      <p>There were no reports of injuries.</p>
      <p>Police say they called off the search at about 9 p.m. -- several hours after the man was last spotted.</p>
