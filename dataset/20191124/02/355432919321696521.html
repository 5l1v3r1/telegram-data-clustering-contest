      <h1>Georgia congresswoman shares letter to son on the anniversary of his death</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T02:07:50+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 02:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rachel-frazin" target="_blank">Rachel Frazin</a></address>
      <p>Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/lucia-lucy-mcbath">Lucy McBath</a> (D-Ga.) shared a letter to her late son on Saturday, on the seventh anniversary of his death. The young man died during an outbreak of gun violence. </p>
      <p>"This is always the hardest day of the year for me. So this year, I want to share a letter I wrote to my son," she tweeted. </p>
      <p>McBath's son Jordan Davis, then 17, was fatally shot at a gas station in 2012 after an argument over loud music. </p>
      <p>"You and your friends were at a gas station, putting gas into your car. Without warning, a man confronted you and opened fire. He shot 10 rounds into the car, and sped away," McBath wrote in a series of tweets addressed to Davis."I didn’t get to hug and kiss you goodbye. You were 17 years old. My heart is still broken."</p>
      <p>She added that immediately following his death, she did not know how to handle her grief. </p>
      <p>"Then, I knew what I had to do. I knew what WE had to do. We would fight to make sure no other families would have to suffer this pain," McBath wrote. "Jordan, I want you to know I am working to carry out your legacy. We thought you would one day fight for change — and now, together, we are carrying out that vision."</p>
      <p>"Seven years later, you still inspire me every single day. I miss you. I love you so much," she concluded. </p>
      <p>McBath has been a vocal advocate for gun law reform including requiring universal background checks following her son's death. She was newly elected in 2018, flipping a previously Republican-held seat.</p>

      <p>Sens. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a> (D-Calif.) and <a href="https://thehill.com/people/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) two lawmakers who are running for president, responded to McBath's tweet thread offering sympathy and calling for change. </p>
      <p>"While I can’t begin to imagine your pain, Jordan's legacy lives on through your fight for safer communities," <a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1198309611176157185">Harris wrote.</a></p>
      <p>"We must call out the fact that Black Americans have borne the brunt of the gun violence tragedy in our country. I promise to fight my heart out—for justice for Jordan, and to end this epidemic," <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1198376376715370496">wrote Warren</a>. </p>
