      <p><b>SHILLONG:</b> The call to enliven life with righteous living and earning was the cornerstone of the 120th Seng kut snem festival of the Khasi indigenous faith. It was on this day that 16 men organized the Khasi-Pnar population from being swamped by the western evangelist faiths.</p>
      <p>On this auspicious occasion where the Khasi-Pnar faithfuls gathered to usher in the rejuvenation of the traditional faith, the Syiem (Chief) of Hima Khyrim, Dr Balajied Syiem categorically stated that outside forces in all formats are working to demoralize the beliefs and practices. In the course of his speech, he  said, “Some 200 years ago, they had brought about light in the form of education but in the process they brought darkness by fooling our indigenous people in our own domain.”</p>
      <p>Stressing that “no intimidation will deter us from respecting the faith that we have followed till date”, Balajied Syiem urged the present Khasi-Pnar generation of the community’s age-old sermons “Kamai ia ka Hok” (Righteous living) and “Tip Kur Kha”  (Respect  your paternal relations and know your own clan).</p>
      <p>Syiem added that “the people following the indigenous faith are under certain stress due to the intervention of forces that has even touched the core of governance within the traditional society.”</p>
      <p>The cultural secretary of the Seng Khasi/Sen Raij, Antonio Lakiang said that “the indigeneous faith is under trying times with outside forces creeping in.” He reminded the gathering that they should “remain firm in their beliefs and take note of the rightful teachings of our forefathers. Be firm in righteous living and righteous earning,” Lakiang appealed to the masses while reminding them  of how the indigeneous faith of the Khasis have stood the onslaught of time.</p>
      <p>The Vice-Chancellor of North Eastern Hill University (NEHU), SK Srivastava, in his brief speech,  spoke about the indigenous Khasi teachings on mankind and the mutual respect shown to nature.</p>
      <p>Earlier during the day, thousands of people marched from Madan Iew Rynhep to Madan Weiking to commemorate the historical event. The rich indigeneous Khasi-Pnar culture was also displayed on the occasion.</p>
