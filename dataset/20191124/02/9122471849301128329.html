      <h1>College GameDay Announces It’s Headed To Minnesota For The First Time In Show History</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T02:16:36+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 02:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>For the first time in show history, College GameDay is headed to Minneapolis, Minnesota to set up shop ahead of a Golden Gophers game. ESPN announced the decision on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Minnesota, in the midst of one of its best seasons in recent history, takes on Wisconsin in its annual rivalry game. This year, the Big Ten West title is on the line.</p>
      <p>The Golden Gophers enter the game with a whopping 10-1 record. The Badgers are 9-2 and could steal the division with a road win.</p>
      <p>Minnesota and Wisconsin are tied in their all-time series, 60-60-8. The Golden Gophers won last year’s matchup, but it was the first time that had happened since 2003. Wisconsin has dominated the series in the 21st century.</p>
      <p>College GameDay reportedly debated heading up to Minnesota a few weeks back when the Golden Gophers took on Penn State. ESPN ultimately decided to head to Tuscaloosa for Alabama vs. LSU instead.</p>

      <p>Minnesota, with a win, would finish the regular season with an 11-1 record and a shot at Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game. If the Golden Gophers can win both, the College Football Playoff is a realistic situation.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin, meanwhile, is looking to play spoiler. The Badgers would love to ruin Minnesota’s great season and get a shot at the Big Ten title game themselves in the process.</p>
      <p>It should be a great atmosphere. The show kicks off at 9:00 AM ET.</p>
