      <p>Flowers and teddy bears have been laid in front of a crime scene to pay tribute to two Logan girls who were found dead in a car outside the home south of Brisbane.</p>
      <p>Paramedics were called to a home at Waterford West in Logan about 1.35pm on Saturday but were unable to revive the sisters, aged one and two.</p>
      <p>Police said it appeared the sisters had died from exposure to extreme heat.</p>

      <p>Mother of the girls Kerri-Ann Conley, 27, was charged with two counts of murder.</p>
      <p>She will appear at Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday.</p>
      <p>Parents with babies and toddlers dropped stuffed animals and flowers outside the home on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>Mother Sarah Boyle said she was saddened by the death of the girls.</p>
      <p>"I met the mother when [the eldest of the two girls] was six months of age at the laundromat on Queens Road and while she was doing her laundry, I offered to feed the baby and from there, I kept contact with her and lost contact over the last year," she said.</p>
      <p>"She was probably only six months but she was a beautiful little thing and it's just sad to know that she and her sister are now dead."</p>
      <p>Ms Boyle's daughter Chelsea left a stuffed animal in honour of the girls who died.</p>
      <p>"It's so to keep the girls really happy and to see that people care about them," she said.</p>

      <p>A neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, said she felt sick to her stomach, knowing it happened so close to home.</p>
      <p>"I've got three kids of my own and I just can't fathom how something like that could have happened," she said.</p>
      <p>"And you just feel useless because you think living so close, you should've known something was not right.</p>

      <p>Neighbour Ramona Winduss, holding back tears in front of her daughter, said it was horrible.</p>
      <p>"I'm gonna go up and lay some flowers today but being a mum myself, I don't know how you leave kids in the car," she said.</p>
      <p>"My heart definitely goes out to the family that's for sure."</p>
      <p>The mother-of-five said it had affected her family, including her children.</p>
      <p>"I've just told them it's a tragic accident that shouldn't have happened," she said.</p>
      <p>"They've seen the news last night and they know it was two young girls and they've all been a little bit teary but it is a sad thing.</p>
      <p>"I think the kids can sort of relate to how a little child would feel in that heat."</p>
      <p>Ms Winduss said they were having a birthday cake for one of her daughters when they heard police sirens on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't until my friend and her son left her phone sitting in the back seat and she brought the phone back in and said to her son, 'mate you can't leave it in the car, it's nearly on fire'," she said.</p>
      <p>"That's when we heard all the commotion and police cars flying passed but they were going that fast I didn't think they were going to stop just there."</p>
      <p>Police are urging anyone with information to Policelink on 131 444 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.</p>
