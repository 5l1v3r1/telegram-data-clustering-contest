      <h1>NAB wants Akram Durrani’s name on ECL</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-24T02:33:10+00:00">24 Nov 2019, 02:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/8792/our-correspondents-2/" target="_blank">​ Our Correspondents</a></address>
      <p><b>ISLAMABAD / SUKKUR: </b>The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has recommended to the interior minister to place the name of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI F) leader and Rehbar Committee Chairman Akram Khan Durrani in the Exit Control List (ECL).</p>
      <p>NAB Rawalpindi had told the interior ministry that the investigation was being carried out against Durrani and it was feared that he could flee the country. It asked the ministry to place his name on the no-fly list.</p>
      <p>Durrani is accused of misusing his powers during his tenure as a minister. NAB’s executive board under the chairmanship of retired Justice Javed Iqbal had approved an inquiry against him.</p>
      <p>The JUI-F leader had been working as federal minister for housing in the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government and as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister from 2002 to 2008.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, former premier Nawaz Sharif through his counsel filed an application in Islamabad High Court for exemption from appearing before the court in the appeal against court’s decision in Al-Azizia reference.</p>
      <p>According to The Express Tribune, Nawaz’s counsel maintained that the former prime minister had gone abroad with the permission of Lahore High Court, therefore, he would not be able to appear before the court on November 25 for the hearing of review petition filed against the court decision in Al-Azizia reference.</p>
      <p>An accountability court on December 24, 2018 had sentenced former prime minister Nawaz Sharif to seven years imprisonment and also imposed fine on him in Al-Azizia reference.</p>
      <p>Nawaz had appealed against the sentence in Islamabad High Court, while NAB has also filed an appeal for extension in his sentence.</p>
      <p>In separate case, an accountability court in Sukkur extended the judicial remand of senior Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader Khursheed Shah by a 15 days.</p>
      <p>Shah was arrested on September 18, 2019, from Islamabad after being accused of making assets beyond means. A large number of PPP supporters had gathered outside the court as Shah was brought by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Sukkur for hearing. He will now be produced before the court on December 7.</p>
      <p>Earlier in October, Shah was admitted to the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) Sukkur. Sources told The Express Tribune that officials of NAB had shifted him to the sanatorium after he complained of chest pain.</p>
      <p>In August, the anti-graft buster had converted an inquiry against Shah into an investigation. He faced charges of transferring an amnesty plot in Sukkur Cooperative Society under his name to build a bungalow and owning hotels, filling stations and bungalows registered under the names of his frontmen and benami companies.</p>
