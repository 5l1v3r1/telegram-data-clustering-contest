      <p>Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_11-23-19">was admitted to a hospital Friday night</a> after experiencing chills and fever earlier in the day, a spokeswoman said Saturday.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg, 86, was initially evaluated at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, DC, before being moved to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore for further evaluation and treatment of any potential infection, said spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg.</p>
      <p>Ginsburgâ€™s symptoms improved after treatment with intravenous antibiotics and fluids, Arberg said.</p>
      <p>The justice is expected to be released from the hospital as early as Sunday.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg has recently suffered a series of health scares.</p>
