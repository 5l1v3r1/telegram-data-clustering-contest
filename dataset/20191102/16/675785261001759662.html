      <h2>The long-rumoured sequel will bring players further into the story of Overwatch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T16:29:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 16:29</time> by <a rel="author">Aodhan Gregory, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aodhan-gregory/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/blizzard-entertainment">Blizzard</a> has announced Overwatch 2, the sequel to its popular team shooter Overwatch, onstage at Blizzcon 2019. <br/><br/>The long-rumoured game, which was unveiled by the series’ creative director Jeff Kaplan, looks to bring players into the story of Overwatch as the world’s heroes stand together against a global Null Sector attack and build upon the original game’s foundation of PvP competition. <br/><br/>In the new cinematic trailer, Winston, Mei and Tracer reunite alongside a new hero, Echo, to save Paris from a giant omnic.</p>

      <p>Unlike the original, which was primarily a PvP multiplayer experience, the sequel will also include more cooperative PvE content that will see players face off against a multitude of computer enemies in both story levels and more replayable hero missions. <br/><br/>The new game will maintain all of the original heroes, maps, and modes, and will also feature a new 6v6 PvP mode called Push, in which two teams will race to make a robot push the map's objective to their opponent's. <br/><br/>It will be available in Casual and Competitive modes, and will also be played in the Overwatch League.</p>

      <p>Alongside a brand-new visual style, gamers will also be able to level up their heroes and customise abilities in co-op ‘Hero Missions’—such as altering Reinhardt’s Fire Strike to ignite nearby enemies or modifying Tracer’s Pulse Bomb to cause a devastating chain reaction.</p>

      <p>But what might come as a relief to long-standing fans of the franchise is  that Overwatch 2 will carry forward existing players’ accomplishments and loot collections.</p>
      <p>More details on Blizzard’s plans, including some of the new heroes joining the fray, will be announced in the future as development continues.</p>
