      <p>HICKSVILLE, Long Island (WABC) -- A Long Island man is accused of biting, punching and dragging his 82-year-old mother after first trying to throw her down a flight of stairs.</p>
      <p>Police said 39-year-old Anil Khandpur allegedly attacked his mother on Friday when she arrived at the home they share in Hicksville.</p>
      <p>Khandpur is accused of grabbing and then dragging his mother to the top of the basement stairs in an attempt to throw her down.</p>
      <p>At one point, his mother was able to kick herself free, and that's when Khandpur allegedly bit her.</p>
      <p>The 82-year-old victim freed herself and ran to the safety of her bedroom where she barricaded herself inside for several hours, police said.</p>
      <p>Upon leaving her bedroom, Khandpur supposedly assaulted his mother again, punching her multiple times in the head, causing substantial pain.</p>
      <p>The victim was able to escape and call 911 for help.</p>
      <p>The police arrived and placed Khandpur under arrest.</p>
      <p>Khandpur faces several charges, including attempted murder, criminal obstruction of breathing, and unlawful imprisonment.</p>
      <p>It's not clear if he has an attorney who can speak for him.</p>
