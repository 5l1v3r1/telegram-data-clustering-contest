      <p>If you happen to stumble on a time machine, consider going back to be an investor in <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2455276/joker#imagegallery">DC's <i>Joker</i> movie</a>. It's a mini ATM, churning out cash week after week and it's about to hit another major box office milestone.</p>
      <p>Will <i>Joker</i> <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482687/will-joker-make-1-billion-at-the-box-office">reach $1 billion worldwide</a>? Well, it's getting closer since it's meant to hit $900 million worldwide by the end of this weekend. That's after being out in theaters for exactly one month.</p>
      <p>Todd Phillips' movie was made on a production budget of somewhere between $55â€“70 million, and even though that doesn't include marketing costs, it's long since made up that coin. It started by breaking records for any October release and recently became the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483229/how-todd-phillips-celebrated-joker-becoming-the-biggest-r-rated-movie-ever">highest-grossing R-rated movie</a> of all time -- <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483197/ryan-reynolds-had-the-best-response-to-jokers-box-office-success">much to Ryan Reynolds' angst</a>. It'll almost surely lead to Joaquin Phoenix <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482154/oscars-2020-voters-share-blunt-thoughts-about-joker">getting an Oscar nomination, if not a win</a>.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/11/01/joker-aquaman-and-wonder-woman-have-turned-the-box-office-battle-between-dc-films-and-marvel-into-a-fair-fight/#70ccf14a21e8">Forbes</a>, <i>Joker</i> is expected to pass <i>Man of Steel</i>'s $291 million domestic gross this weekend, and pass $600 million at the international box office (without any help from China) for a total close to $900 million by Sunday. As the site noted, when -- not if, when -- Joker passes <i>Spider-Man: Homecoming</i>'s $880M and <i>Spider-Man 3</i>'s $890M it'll be the 8th biggest solo comic book movie ever (unadjusted for inflation).</p>
      <p><i>Joker</i> keeps leaving much bigger and more typical comic book movies in the dust. What's next? We don't know if it'll get there, but <i>Joker</i> could rival <i>The Dark Knight</i>'s $1.004 billion if it does manage to hit that next major milestone. Can you imagine? <i>The Dark Knight</i> reportedly cost $185 million to make before it came out in 2008. It's a very different movie, with a very different Joker from Heath Ledger, who won an Oscar for the role. But Joaquin Phoenix could seriously give DC's Joker a second Oscar. Batman is screaming.</p>
      <p><i>Joker</i> left fans with a lot of questions, and it sounds like most were <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483615/jokers-todd-phillips-is-playing-cagey-about-what-was-real-or-in-arthurs-mind">intentional from director Todd Phillips</a>. That's one of the reasons why this movie keeps making money -- fans are seeing it multiple times and finding new details in each viewing.</p>
      <p>But here's my question: What's Bradley Cooper's cut from this movie? He's listed as one of the producers. Yes, the same Bradley Cooper who had a surprise hit last year with <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483681/lady-gaga-is-teaming-with-ridley-scott-for-her-first-movie-post-a-star-is-born">Lady Gaga in <i>A Star Is Born</i></a> and who voices Rocket in <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>. Don't sleep on Bradley Cooper, he's coming for all the box office receipts and awards.</p>
      <p><i>Joker</i> topped the box office for its first two weekends, took second for its third, and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483370/surprise-joker-didnt-actually-win-the-box-office-this-weekend">almost won its fourth weekend</a> last week. This weekend it's expected to make around $11 million at the domestic box office, placing third behind <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> and <i>Maleficent: Mistress of Evil</i>, but it'll be a close one with <i>Maleficent 2</i> again. Joker vs. Maleficent -- who saw that coming as our fall 2019 villain showdown? Check our weekend box office rundown on Sunday for the final estimates.</p>
