      <p>A fast-food lover bought a McDonald's meal 10 years ago and kept it in a glass cabinet - and it doesn’t look like it’s aged one bit.</p>
      <p>Hjortur Smarason was devastated when McDonald's closed all three of its restaurants in Iceland in 2009, so much so that he bought the nation's final burger and fries.</p>
      <p>In a bid to test the theory of a McDonald's meal never ageing, Mr Smarason kept the food as a home-experiement.</p>
      <p>This week marks 10 years since the food was purchased - and it still looks pretty tasty.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://snotrahouse.com/last-mcdonalds/">live stream of the burger and fries</a> shows there are no signs of mould or decay on the food.</p>

      <p>"I had heard that McDonald's never decompose so I just wanted to see if it was true or not,” Mr Smarason told AFP.</p>
      <p>The meal is now kept in a glass cabinet in Snotra House, a hostel in southern Iceland.</p>
      <p>Before that, Mr Smarason kept the fast-food in a plastic bag in his garage, and after three years he donated the meal to the National Museum of Iceland where he noticed barely any change in its appearance.</p>
      <p>Then the Museum decided that they weren’t equipped to preserve the food which is when they returned it to its original owner.</p>
      <p>The meal was then kept at a different hostel in Reykjavik, before moving to its current home.</p>

      <p>Hostel owner Siggi Sigurdur, who says people visit from around the world to see the burger and chips, told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-50262547">BBC News</a> : “The old guy is still there, feeling quite well.</p>
      <p>"It's a fun thing, of course, but it makes you think about what you are eating. There is no mould, it's only the paper wrapping that looks old."</p>
