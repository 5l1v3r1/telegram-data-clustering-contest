      <p>RCMP are investigating a string of rental scams that have been targeting would-be renters in Kelowna.</p>
      <p>The fraudsters are reportedly listing property for rent in the Kelowna area in which police believe they are currently renting through sites like AirBnb.</p>
      <p>Posing as the property’s owner, the scammer then lists the site online and shows the property to renters and then secures damage deposits. Come move-in day, the scam victims find the property is occupied. They are then unable to track down the scammer and are out their deposits.</p>

      <p>Cpl. Meghan Foster with the Kelowna RCMP believe the scammer used a fake name during the rental frauds.</p>
      <p>“The suspect male has allegedly provided the name of Tim Halyhart to the renters but we do not believe this to be the suspect male’s true identity,” said Foster.</p>
      <p>“This investigation is on-going and our priority is to identify the suspect male in an effort to advance the investigation.”</p>
      <p>Halyhart is described as a black male between the ages of 23 and 30, five-foot-eleven and with a larger body build.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information are asked to cal Kelowna RCMP at 250-762-3300 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.</p>
