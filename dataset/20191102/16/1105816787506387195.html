      <p><b>NICE, FRANCE: </b>More than 30 migrants from Pakistan have been found hidden in a lorry in southern France, prosecutors said Saturday.</p>
      <p>They said the driver, who was also from Pakistan, was detained.</p>
      <p>The discovery came after 39 people, all believed to be Vietnamese nationals, were found dead in a refrigerated truck in Britain last month, laying bare again the risks of illegal migrant routes to Europe.</p>
      <p>The group of 31 Pakistani migrants was discovered during a routine check on a motorway near the Italian border on Friday, French prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>The migrants, who included three teenagers, were handed over to the Italian authorities in accordance with immigration procedures.</p>
      <p>“We will try and establish if we can trace it back to a network and backers as we always do in this type of case,” the prosecutors’ office in the southeastern city of Nice said.</p>
