      <h1>Off to The Dolphin it is: Plymouth Argyle fans react to Home Park postponement</h1>
      <h2>The League Two game against Grimsby was called off due to roof damage to the Barn Park End</h2>

      <p>The Green Army reacted with a mixture of annoyance and humour on social media after the postponement of Plymouth Argyle's League Two game against Grimsby Town today.</p>
      <p>The game was called off at around 12.30pm - two-and-a-half hours before the scheduled kick-off - after damage to the roof of the Barn Park End at Home Park.</p>
      <p>A section of the roof had become loose after overnight gales battered Plymouth and the rest of Devon and Cornwall.</p>
      <p>The decision to postpone the game was taken on safety grounds, after consultations between Argyle, Plymouth City Council and the police.</p>
      <p>Some supporters were angered at what they considered as the late timing of the announcement and sympathised with Grimsby fans who had travelled all the way down from Humberside.</p>
      <p>Others, though, were determined to make the most of the afternoon off, with Roger Willis tweeting he was off to The Dolphin, the popular pub on the Barbican.</p>
      <p>Phil Toms, meanwhile, was going to have 'a Pasty fest' until his return train home.</p>
      <p>One of the funniest quips, though, came from Luke @lfolland27 who tweeted: "Ryan Lowe did want us to take the roof off the place tbf <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pafc?src=hash">#pafc</a>.'  </p>
      <p>Here is a selection of the comments to the postponement from the Green Army. </p>
