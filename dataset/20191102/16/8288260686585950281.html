      <p>A brazen duo have been jailed after the "brutally" attack of a sleeping homeless man.</p>
      <p>The callous pair attacked the helpless, defenceless rough sleeper in Blackpool.</p>
      <p>And, sickeningly, the 19-year-old and 22-year-old attackers filmed it.</p>
      <p>The victim, who is in his 20s, was sleeping rough in a shop doorway on Bank Hey Street when they launched the vicious attack, which left him with serious head injuries.</p>

      <p>Following the attack in the early hours of September 24, Pendergast and Sharman, both from Blackpool, were charged with assault, the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/two-men-launched-brutal-attack-17189998">Manchester Evening News reported.</a></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Inspector David Wilson, of Blackpool Police, said: “This was an entirely unprovoked attack, which was both brutal and sustained, leaving an innocent and clearly vulnerable man with extremely nasty injuries.</p>
      <p>“Pendergast and Sharman should be utterly ashamed of their actions that morning."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The pair appeared at Preston Crown Court on Friday (November 1), having previously pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm.</p>
      <p>Sharman was sentenced to six months imprisonment and told to pay a £115 victim surcharge.</p>
      <p>Pendergast was sentenced to six months in a young offenders’ institution and told to pay a £115 victim surcharge.</p>
      <p>Insp Wilson added: “I am satisfied with the sentence handed down to them and I hope they use their time behind bars to reflect on the consequences of their actions.”</p>
