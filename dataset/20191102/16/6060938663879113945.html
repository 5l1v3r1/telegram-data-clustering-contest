      <p>Shah Rukh Khan’s 54th birthday celebration was surely something to remember. The King of hearts as he is rightly called, made the day extra special for all his fans, especially those who flocked in large numbers to catch a glimpse of him at Mannat.</p>
      <p>Not only did he ring in his day with fans at the stroke of midnight, but, he also made a second appearance later the same evening, and joined an auditorium full of fans for a fun interaction and celebration. After cutting his cake and delivering some of his best dialogues, King Khan also opened up about his kids and why his next films are so important for him.</p>

      <p>Shah Rukh recalled a conversation he had with Aryan, where the young hunk said, “When we (Suhana and himself) were growing up we saw ‘Kuch Kuch Hota Hai’, ‘Baazigar’, but AbRam doesn’t have any such character-film or commercial film that will convince him that his father is such a big star. So in the next 3-4 years, you make such a great film that AbRam also knows why so many people love you.”</p>
      <p>SRK added, “I work very hard to make sure I do something like that.”</p>
      <p>Watch his reply in the video below:</p>

      <p>During the interaction, the actor also confirmed that he will release a film next year and that he will make an official announcement in the coming months, when the film goes on floors.</p>
      <p>Early this evening, fans were in for a pleasant surprise when the actor arrived on his pedestal with his youngest son in tow. The cutie was all smiles as he waved to the fans. We must say that AbRam looked all grown up rocking a short and spiked new hairdo.</p>
