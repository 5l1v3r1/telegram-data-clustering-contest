      <p><a href="https://mspoweruser.com/apple-officially-announces-airpods-pro-with-active-noise-cancellation-and-in-ear-design/">Apple recently launched the new Apple AirPods Pro for $250</a>, but surprisingly it is already possible to grab a pair at a considerable discount.</p>
      <p>The AirPods Pro features Active Noise Cancellation and much-improved noise isolation.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Highlights of AirPods Pro:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each earbud comes with three different sizes of soft, flexible silicone ear tips that conform to the contours of each individual ear, providing both a comfortable fit and a superior seal.</li>
        <li>To further maximize comfort, AirPods Pro use an innovative vent system to equalize pressure, minimizing the discomfort common in other in-ear designs.</li>
        <li>AirPods Pro are sweat- and water-resistant, making them perfect for active lifestyles.</li>
        <li>Active Noise Cancellation on AirPods Pro uses two microphones combined with advanced software to continuously adapt to each individual ear and headphone fit.</li>
        <li>AirPods Pro deliver superior sound quality with Adaptive EQ, which automatically tunes the low- and mid-frequencies of the music to the shape of an individual’s ear</li>
        <li>A custom high dynamic range amplifier produces pure, incredibly clear sound while also extending battery life, and powers a custom high-excursion, low-distortion speaker driver designed to optimize audio quality and remove background noise. The driver provides consistent, rich bass down to 20Hz and detailed mid- and high-frequency audio.</li>
        <li>Transparency mode provides users with the option to simultaneously listen to music while still hearing the environment around them.</li>
        <li>Switching between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency modes is simple and can be done directly on AirPods Pro using a new, innovative force sensor on the stem.</li>
        <li>AirPods Pro feature the same battery life as AirPods with up to five hours of listening time. In Active Noise Cancellation mode, AirPods Pro deliver up to four and a half hours of listening time and up to three and a half hours of talk time on a single charge.</li>
        <li>Through additional charges from the Wireless Charging Case, AirPods Pro deliver over 24 hours of listening time or over 18 hours of talk time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other features supported by AirPods Pro:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The Ear Tip Fit Test </b>helps ensure users get the best audio experience from AirPods Pro by testing the quality of the seal and identifying the best ear tip size for them. After placing AirPods Pro in each ear, advanced algorithms work together with the microphones in each AirPod to measure the sound level in the ear and compare it to what is coming from the speaker driver. In just seconds, the algorithm detects whether the ear tip is the right size and has a good fit, or should be adjusted to create a better seal.</li>
        <li><b>Voice-activated Siri </b>uses the H1 chip to enable hands-free “Hey Siri” to play a song, increase the volume, make a call or get directions.</li>
        <li><b>Audio Sharing</b> makes it easy to listen to the same song or watch the same movie with a friend by simply bringing a second pair of AirPods close to iPhone or iPad.</li>
        <li><b>Announce Messages</b> automatically and conveniently speaks incoming messages as soon as they arrive, and when on a phone call or sharing media via Audio Sharing, Siri knows not to interrupt.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Amazon is now selling the in-ear truly wireless headphones for only $234.99, a 6% discount on the launch price a few weeks ago.</p>
