        <i>US designer and red-carpet favourite says he is ‘deeply saddened’ at decision</i>
      </p>
      <p>The designer Zac Posen is shutting down his eponymous label.</p>
      <p>Posen, who has been a red-carpet favourite for almost two decades, is known for glamorous, body-hugging gowns, often with long trains or flamboyant ruffles, for stars including Katie Holmes and Rihanna.</p>
      <p>An announcement by the owners, House of Z and Z Spoke, on Friday said the company could no longer continue operations. It had been in a sale process.</p>
      <p>Posen, 39, said he was “deeply saddened that the journey of nearly 20 years has come to an end”. He launched his label in 2001.</p>
      <p>“The management team … worked extremely hard to navigate the increasingly challenging fashion and retail landscape,” he said in a statement. “We are disappointed that these efforts have not been successful and deeply saddened that the journey of nearly 20 years has come to an end.</p>
      <p>“I am grateful to the team who lent their incomparable talent and commitment along the way. I remain incredibly proud of what we created and hopeful for the future.”</p>
      <p>Posen also serves as creative director for the Brooks Brothers women’s collection.</p>
      <p>His prominent designs include a mermaid-like gown for Gwyneth Paltrow at the 2007 Oscars, an off-the-shoulder gown with brightly sequinned skirt for Oprah Winfrey at the 2011 Oscars, and a fitted pink satin gown for Rihanna at the 2014 Diamond Ball.</p>
