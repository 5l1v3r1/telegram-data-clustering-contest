      <p>A defensively depleted Kilmarnock fell to a 3-0 defeat to Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>With all four natural centre-backs unavailable, midfielders Gary Dicker and Iain Wilson were forced to fill in at the back.</p>
      <p>Curtis Main, Sam Cosgrove and Scott McKenna all fired home to give the Dons a comfortable win.</p>
      <p>Little chances fell for either side in the opening 10 minutes, but in the 12th the hosts raced ahead.</p>
      <p>Main headed home unmarked after a Lewis Ferguson cross to fire the Pittodrie men into the lead.</p>
      <p>Rory McKenzie had a good chance for the visitors in the 18th minute when he picked up the ball 25 yards out, his long-range effort was well saved by Joe Lewis.</p>
      <p>Sam Cosgrove raced through on goal a minute later, but his eventual effort skewed wide.</p>

      <p>in the 27th minute things went from bad to worse for Killie as Cosgrove doubled the Dons' lead.</p>
      <p>Another free header, this time from a corner put the hosts two ahead.</p>
      <p>Dom Thomas looked to create a spark of magic in the 39th minute when he attempted a speculative shot from 30 yards, but it flew over the crossbar.</p>
      <p>Eamonn Brophy had half a chance three minutes later on the turn, but his effort was easily held by Lewis.</p>

      <p>Alan Power went close with a deflected shot just before the break but again it was well saved by Lewis.</p>
      <p>Cosgrove looked sure to make it three early in the second-half, but his effort smacked the post.</p>
      <p>In the 70th minute Dons substitute Jon Gallagher went close twice in the space of a minute, forcing two top saves from Laurentiu Branescu.</p>
      <p>Lewis Ferguson danced in from the right wing in the 72nd minute, but his shot was incredibly blocked on the line by Iain Wilson.</p>
      <p>Main almost added his second in the 79th minute, but his back-post header was blocked out for a corner.</p>
      <p>With six minutes left, Aberdeen made it three thanks to a poorly defended goal that was knocked in by Scott McKenna.</p>
