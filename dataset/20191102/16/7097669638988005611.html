      <p>Raquel Makler, 22, a wine bar manager, claimed to the New York Times that Mr Cailan assaulted her at his apartment.</p>
      <p>Sarah Fernandez, 29, a wine sales representative, also claimed that she had been assaulted at his apartment by the sommelier. Two women who declined to be named made similar allegations.</p>
      <p>In an email to the newspaper Mr Cailan said: "The truth is, these allegations against me are false. I look forward to the opportunity to clear my name."</p>
      <p>In the last few years the #MeToo movement has led to sexual assault and misconduct allegations against a series of prominent men involved in the restaurant industry.</p>
      <p>The wine business is also dominated by men and sexual harassment is common, the New York Times reported after speaking to 30 women across the industry.</p>
