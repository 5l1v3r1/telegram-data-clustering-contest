      <p><a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-drops-off-his-new-album-ghetto-cowboy-new-mixtape.119722.html">On Friday, Yelawolf delivered his second project of the year, <i>Ghetto Cowboy</i></a>. It fittingly arrived the day after Halloween, as it commences with a graphic account of assault given over a chilling instrumental. As the album progresses, the clouds start to part. The music becomes lighter, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf/profile">Yelawolf</a>'s tone becomes less hostile. Track 5, "Here I Am", breaks into the cathartic chant of "Im'ma woop this motherfucker's ass I swear / Im'ma tear this bitch up / I'ma throw a fucking chair." By Track 6, "Still Ridin'", things take a turn and the Alabama artist leans more into the breeziness of his classic rock influences.</p>
      <p>"Still Ridin'" keeps the energy levels high without tipping over into over-indulgent fits of anger. Yelawolf flexes his lyrical dexterity while stitching together poetic tidbits with an overarching narrative. While he possesses the balanced delivery of a steady driver, the beat ensures a smooth ride. There's a percolating noise that persists beneath the verses, which is surprisingly just as pleasant as the wheezing synths in the chorus. The record-scratching, bassline and percussion all keep it feeling fresh and funky.</p>
