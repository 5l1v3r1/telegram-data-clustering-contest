      <h1>Pamela Anderson draws condemnation with Indigenous headdress Halloween tweet</h1>
      <h2>Tweet shows two photos of the Ladysmith-born model, semi-nude, with feather headdress</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T16:30:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/ashley-wadhwani/" target="_blank">Ashley Wadhwani</a></address>
      <p>Pamela Anderson is under fire, being criticized for cultural appropriation, after her foundation tweeted a photo of her wearing a feathered headdress on Halloween.</p>
      <p>The tweet shows a semi-nude Anderson, who was born and raised in Ladysmith, in <a href="https://twitter.com/pamfoundation/status/1190040368148090891">two black and white </a><a href="https://twitter.com/pamfoundation/status/1190040368148090891">photos</a>. The first shows her holding the Indigenous-inspired headdress while the second shows it on her head. It’s unclear if the photo is new or from previous photoshoots.</p>
      <p>Many were quick to call the model and animals rights activist out for the photos being racist.</p>
      <p>“Warbonnets are not props or accessories they’re sacred, they’re earned. Culture isn’t a costume, it’s not disposable, it’s not an aesthetic. This is degrading &amp; insensitive to #MMIW due to hypersexualized imagery. In donning a headdress you’ve also participated in stolen valor,” tweeted user @odetomedusa.</p>

      <p>“How the heck could @pamfoundation not know this is unacceptable in 2019? She’s Canadian and is ignorant to Indigenous matters. TBH, I really didn’t expect anything more from that woman…so uninformed in so many ways,” @moilthegoil tweeted.</p>
      <p>In 2011 U.S. universities launched on-campus campaigns called “We’re a culture, not a costume” to bring awareness to cultural appropriation, or using costumes and props from a certain culture for superficial and temporary purposes.</p>
      <p>Eight years later, offensive costumes are still an issue – specifically being highlighted during the Canadian federal election after leaked photos showed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in brownface and blackface on more than one occasion.</p>

      <p>Anderson spent several days of the election campaign in B.C. supporting Green Party MP Paul Manly on Vancouver Island as well as candidates in Vancouver.</p>
      <p>“I wonder how @ElizabethMay and @CanadianGreens feel about this,” tweeted AllyReda89.</p>
      <p>Black Press Media has reached out to Pamela Anderson’s publicist for comment.</p>
