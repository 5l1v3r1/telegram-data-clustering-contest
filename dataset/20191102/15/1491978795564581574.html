        <i>Actor Olivia Wilde, who directed Booksmart, called out the airline on Twitter for showing edited versions of her film</i>
      </p>
      <p>The airline Delta has said it will start showing fuller versions of the films <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/booksmart">Booksmart</a> and Rocketman that were controversially edited to remove scenes involving LGBTQ love and sexuality.</p>
      <p>“We are working to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” a spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>Delta faced criticism after it emerged it was showing films with edits that seemingly targeted gay and lesbian sexuality.</p>
      <p>The actor Olivia Wilde said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/31/no-scissor-emoji-olivia-wilde-criticises-airline-censorship-of-booksmart">a version of the movie Booksmart</a>, which she directed, omitted a lesbian sex scene, a female masturbation scene, the words “vagina” and “genitals” and an animated sequence in which the two main characters turn into naked dolls.</p>
      <p>She also <a href="https://twitter.com/oliviawilde/status/1189604907944427520">pointed out</a> that the word “fuck” was not cut from the scene in which “vagina” was muted.</p>
      <p>“What message is this sending to viewers and especially to women?” Wilde wrote on Twitter. “That their bodies are obscene? That their sexuality is shameful?”</p>
      <p>Delta previously attracted opprobrium for showing a version of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/rocketman">Rocketman</a>, the Elton John biopic starring Tarron Egerton, which removed any reference to the musician’s sexual orientation.</p>
      <p>The airline said the edits were made, unrequested, by a third-party vendor, with Delta picking the version for in-flight viewing. It said it has now put in place new measures to ensure the movies do not omit the LGBTQ scenes.</p>
      <p>“Studios often provide videos in two forms: a theatrical, original version and an edited version,” a Delta spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>“We selected the edited version and now realize content well within our guidelines was unnecessarily excluded from both films. We are working to make sure this doesn’t happen again.<br/><br/>“The studio has agreed to provide a special Delta edit that retains the LGBTQ+ love scenes in both Booksmart and Rocketman that will be on our flights as soon as possible.”</p>
      <p>Wilde <a href="https://twitter.com/oliviawilde/status/1190441367014498305">said thank you</a> on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The spokeswoman said it was not Delta’s practice to omit LGBTQ love scenes, pointing to fuller in-flight versions of series and movies including Gentleman Jack and Moonlight.</p>
