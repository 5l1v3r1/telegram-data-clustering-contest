        <b>Eight départments on the Atlantic coast have been put on orange alert as Amélie, the first storm of Autumn, is expected to hit in the early hours of Sunday.<br/> </b>
      </p>
      <p>Most storms in France are in the Autumn. Over the last 39 years there have been 39 storms in November. </p>
      <p>So they're regular but they differ in intensity. </p>
      <p>Amélie is a sweet-sounding name but Méteo France expects her to be powerful judging by the satellite images over the Atlantic.</p>
      <p>The weather office forecasts Amélie will hit the coast at around 1 a.m. on Sunday, bringing gales of up to 130km/h.</p>

      <p>Eight départements have been placed on orange alert (the second highest): Charente-Maritime, Gironde, Vendée, Charente, Landes, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne.</p>
      <p>People in those areas are advised to be vigilant and avoid travelling around.</p>
      <p>The storm should subside by Sunday afternoon.</p>
