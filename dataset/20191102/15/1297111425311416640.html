      <p>Initially, reading the libretto (script) for Missing made Heather Molloy uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>In the opera about missing and murdered Indigenous women, Molloy portrays Jess, who is “not a very sympathetic character.”</p>
      <p>At first, “I thought it was a bit outrageous and a bit over the top, the things that were coming out of this character’s mouth,” said Molloy.</p>
      <p>“And then I went back home to Saskatchewan and I was learning (the script), and … I heard everything that this character said, coming out of the mouths of people I know.”</p>
      <p>Molloy, who now lives in Vancouver, resumes the role of Jess as <a href="https://wp.me/p6FXD5-2p5L">Missing tours to Regina for a Regina Symphony Orchestra co-production on Nov. 8 and 9.</a></p>
      <p>Marie Clements, who wrote the libretto for City Opera Vancouver and Pacific Opera Victoria, focused on two young women, one Indigenous and one non-Indigenous.</p>
      <p>Their chance meeting “changes their lives forever, both of them,” said Clements.</p>
      <p>She wanted to send a message of “our responsibility in making it possible that all young women have a chance to live a life and follow their plans and their dreams.”</p>
      <p>“Hopefully the thing that all human beings have in common is that we love our children and we want the best for them. We want to protect them and we want them to have a life where they feel fulfilled,” added Clements. “And I think if we could believe that that is the right of every child, things might change.”</p>
      <p>Focusing on individual characters is “a great place to start having these conversations,” said Molloy. Each missing or murdered woman is a person with a story, “rather than these huge, horrible statistics.”</p>
      <p>“As a white person, as a settler … we’re all part of living in Canada,” added Molloy. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/a-state-of-race-introducing-a-seven-part-series">“It can be quite a divisive place</a> and this can be quite a divisive topic for some strange reason.”</p>
      <p>Data shows that Indigenous women are victimized at a much higher rate than non-Indigenous women. The RCMP counted 1,181 missing and murdered women between 1980 and 2012, but the actual toll is believed to be much higher. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/mmiwg-finding-of-race-based-genocide-gets-differing-reception-in-sask">A national inquiry into the MMIW issue this year labelled it genocide.</a></p>

      <h3>Why opera?</h3>
      <p>Clements sees music as a universal language.</p>
      <p>“Music is one of the ways that we do kind of respond as human beings and open our hearts before we have time to even judge or intellectualize something. So I think opera’s such a great opportunity to engage in a story that is big, but also very personal,” said Clements.</p>
      <p>Opera is “such a beautiful form of storytelling,” Molloy agreed.</p>
      <p>She became enamoured by opera in seeing Hansel and Gretel at the Met a decade ago: “It was like, how have I lived on this planet this long and never seen this?”</p>
      <p>Molloy attended the University of Regina, after finishing high school at Riffel. (She attended Moose Jaw’s Vanier Collegiate before that.) She studied music with Lynn Channing to earn her bachelor’s degree, then attended the University of British Columbia for a master’s degree.</p>
      <p>Molloy said if anyone has been curious about opera, a rare occurrence in Regina, Missing is a show to see.</p>
      <p>“It is storytelling. It’s music. And people have this idea of opera being fat women in frilly dresses, singing in languages that they don’t understand,” said Molloy.</p>
      <p>Missing presents “a very relatable story,” along with surtitles to clarify what the performers are singing about. The performance is in English and the Gitxsan First Nation’s language.</p>
      <p>Juno Award-winning composer Brian Current wrote the music, which includes “lots of woodwinds, lots of percussion, lots of mallets,” added Molloy.</p>
      <p>“The soundscapes are just unlike anything; especially in the Prairies, we don’t have access to this a lot.”</p>
      <p>With projections designed by Andy Moro, Molloy said the stage “almost looks alive at times.”</p>
