      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T15:54:27+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 15:54</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>An anti-gun activist <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/murder">shot dead</a> her three kids before killing herself just days after her divorce was finalised.</p>
      <p>Ashley Auzenne, 39, turned the handgun on herself after murdering her children Parrish, 11, Eleanor, nine, and Lincoln, seven, at their home in Texas.</p>
      <p>Murvin Auzenne Jnr, the children's father, said his ex-wife was "very upset" with the terms of their divorce, which meant that she would have to get a job and pay him rent if she stayed in the family home.</p>
      <p>The devastated dad said there were no warning signs before the triple murder-suicide and nothing to suggest that his wife was "capable of this".</p>

      <p>The mum and children were found dead in different areas of the home in Deer Park, just east of Houston, just before 9am local time on Tuesday during a welfare check by police.</p>
      <p>A family member called police saying relatives hadn't heard from Auzenne in a number of days.</p>
      <p>Mr Auzenne told the <a href="http://houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Father-of-Deer-Park-children-slain-14574739.php">Houston Chronicle:</a> “Ashley tried her best to be a good mother.</p>

        <figcaption>The mum was an anti-gun campaigner, according to friends (Image: Facebook)</figcaption>

      <p>"She and I had our issues, we argued and fought just like any other couple headed for divorce, but I never had any reason to believe she was capable of this.</p>
      <p>"Nobody did.”</p>
      <p>Auzenne filed for divorce in 2017, but the case was dismissed, local media reported.</p>
      <p>She filed for divorce again six months later and the couple agreed a settlement last week.</p>
      <p>Friends said Auzenne was an outspoken anti-gun activist.</p>

      <p>Last year, she posted a photo of herself with the captions #Enough and #EndGunViolence.</p>
      <p>Just months earlier she told of her struggles with depression, anxiety, sleep apnea, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/facts-arthritis-how-you-can-6416990">arthritis</a> and lupus, an incurable condition in which the immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs.</p>
      <p>Her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page was also filled with photos of her children, and posts revealed that her stepmother died in March.</p>
      <p>The children's paternal grandfather, Murvin Auzenne Snr, said the family has been left devastated.</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://abc13.com/mom-shoots-her-3-children-to-death-after-divorce-finalized/5659871/">ABC 13:</a> "They were kids you wanted to have around, they really were.</p>
      <p>"They're amazing children in all kinds of fantastic ways."</p>
      <p>He added: "The family has all rallied around my son, Murvin. Our focus is only on one thing: helping through this difficult time."</p>
      <p>Stunned neighbour Annette Flores told <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/3-children-1-adult-found-dead-inside-deer-park-home-police-say">Click 2 Houston:</a> "I'm upset. Children? Really?</p>
      <p>"Children are innocent... it's just, it's a waste, and it's just really bad.</p>
      <p>"And it makes me angry that someone would take it out on children."</p>
      <p>A coroner ruled the deaths a triple murder-suicide.</p>
