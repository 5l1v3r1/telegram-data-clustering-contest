      <p>The video, which has more than 22,000 views on <a href="https://twitter.com/CGHSFL/status/1188256724836327426?s=20">Twitter</a> since it was posted Oct. 26, shows the school's cheerleaders and dance team performing in the high school gym, the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article236811548.html">Miami Herald </a>reported.</p>
      <p>During the pep rally, Rivera approaches, then turns around and dances in sync with the music and the performers.</p>
      <p>Rivera's appearance was a surprise to all except the Cardinal Gibbons dance coach, <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/state/video-south-florida-priest-shows-off-dance-moves-at-cardinal-gibbons-high-school-pep-rally">WPTV</a> reported. Rivera, from Puerto Rico, practiced the initial moves in the week leading up to the pep rally, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/dancing-priest-video-high-school">Fox News</a> reported. Then he memorized the entire routine.</p>
      <p>Predictably, Rivera's moves drew a raucous response from the student body.</p>
      <p>Rivera was not giving interviews about his performance, the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article236811548.html">Herald</a> reported. However, social media posters had plenty to say.</p>
      <p>“Now this is what I’d like to refer to as dancing for Jesus!” Twitter user Laurie Harris <a href="https://twitter.com/laurie3340/status/1189191990635712512?s=20">tweeted</a>. “Love it!”</p>
      <p>Rivera now has his own hashtag: #dancingpriest.</p>
