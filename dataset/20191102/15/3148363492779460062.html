      <p>Carabinieri police said the arrests Saturday stem from a probe begun in 2012 with a heroin seizure in Perugia, a university town in central Italy.</p>
      <p>Investigators say one ringleader is a Tanzanian who, from his base in Poland, directed heroin shipments from Asia to Italy for street sales.</p>
      <p>Since the probe began, 144 drug couriers have been arrested.</p>
      <p>Initially using Africans, traffickers later employed Italians, Greeks, Spaniards, Bulgarians and Hungarians as drug couriers.</p>
      <p>Police say couriers reached Italy aboard cargo boats, planes, trains, buses and taxis.</p>
      <p>Heroin worth 35 million euros ($39 million) and cocaine worth 4.2 million euros ($4.7 million) has been seized during the course of the probe.</p>
