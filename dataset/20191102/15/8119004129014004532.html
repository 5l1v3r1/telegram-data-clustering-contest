        <b>Transport owners have called for certain provisions of the new road transport law to be revised arguing that it will lead to a shortage of drivers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The government passed the law following unprecedented student protests for justice for two college students’ death in an accident last year. The law came into effect from Nov 1.</p>

      <p>Khandaker Enayetullah, secretary general of Bangladesh Transport Owners Association, offered 'full support' to the legislation but urged the government to reconsider some of the provisions.</p>
      <p>“The non-bailable offences under the law will lead to a shortage of drivers,” he told a media briefing in Dhaka on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The legislation imposes a maximum five-year jail term or Tk 500,000 fines or both on drivers involved in road traffic accidents while denying bail for bus accidents.</p>
      <p>Punishment for violation of other traffic rules like driving a vehicle without fitness, not taking stipulated safety measures while driving, and jaywalking, has also been increased.</p>
      <p>“At present, the transport sector is facing a shortage of drivers. If a driver cannot secure bail and is jailed soon after an accident, the crisis will deepen. What will happen then?, " said Enayetullah.</p>
      <p>According to a report by the World Health Organisation on road crashes, there are 2 million licenced drivers against the 3.8 million registered vehicles in Bangladesh. That means about 1.8 million vehicles are driven by untrained drivers.</p>
