      <p>Nine children were killed when a planted roadside bomb exploded as they walked to school in a northeastern province of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/afghanistan.html">Afghanistan</a>, government and police officials said.</p>
      <p>The blast happened in Darqad district of Takhar province on Saturday, when the children, aged between eight and 11, stepped on the bomb planted on a road in a Taliban-controlled village.</p>
      <p>"In the morning on roadside, nine children were killed in a landmine blast placed by the Taliban. Three children, who were part of the group, are missing," Jawad Hejri, a spokesman for the Takhar provincial governor, told Al Jazeera. </p>
      <p>No group has claimed responsibility for the blast, and the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/taliban.html">Taliban</a> did not immediately respond to a request for comment following the deaths of the children, the latest victims in a growing toll of civilian casualties in the war.</p>
      <p>"This area is under Taliban control and since security forces launched attacks to clear it, the Taliban have planted anti-personnel mines," Khalil Asir, a spokesman for the provincial police, told Reuters news agency.</p>
      <p>In May, a landmine killed seven children and wounded two more in the southern province of Ghazni. </p>
      <p>Last month, the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/un.html">United Nations</a> released a report saying an "unprecedented" number of civilians were killed or wounded in Afghanistan from July to September this year.</p>
      <p>The figures - 1,174 deaths and 3,139 injuries from July 1 until September 30 - represent a 42 percent increase compared with the same period last year.</p>
      <p>A month earlier, seven children were killed and 10 more wounded in the eastern province of Laghman when a mortar shell exploded while they were playing with it.</p>
      <p>The Taliban often uses roadside bombs and landmines to target Afghan security forces, but the lethal weapons also inflict casualties on civilians.</p>
      <p>Years of conflict have left Afghanistan strewn with landmines, unexploded mortars, rockets and homemade bombs - and many are picked up by curious children.</p>
