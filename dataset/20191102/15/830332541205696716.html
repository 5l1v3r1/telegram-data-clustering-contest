      <p>MIDDLETON, Wis. - It's that time of year again: Temperatures are falling, and the number of local car thefts is going up.</p>
      <p>Middleton police issued a reminder overnight to never leave a car running with the keys in it.</p>
      <p>This release comes after a 14-year-old boy stole a car from the Pick 'N Save parking lot on Century Avenue. Officers report the keys were left inside the car when it was stolen around 7:30 p.m. Friday.</p>
      <p>Officers found the car abandoned on a nearby street and eventually found the boy, who is now booked in the Juvenile Reception Center.</p>
      <p>Police are using this as an opportunity to remind all drivers of winter safety.</p>
      <p>"Given this onset of an early winter season, the Middleton Police Department would like to remind the public to remain diligent with locking motor vehicles and never leave a running vehicle unattended," Sgt. Tyler Loether said in a news release.</p>
