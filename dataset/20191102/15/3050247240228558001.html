      <h1>CasperLabs Shows First ‘Provably Safe’ Ethereum PoS Protocol ‘Highway’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T15:44:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 15:44</time> by <a rel="author">Adrian Zmudzinski</a></address>
      <p>Ethereum development firm CasperLabs announced “Highway,” allegedly the first <a href="https://github.com/cbc-casper/cbc-casper-paper">correct-by-construction</a> Casper Proof of Stake (PoS) implementation that is provably live and safe.</p>
      <h3>Provably safe and live</h3>
      <p>According to a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Nov. 1, a protocol is safe if it is consistent in its decision and live if it guarantees a decision. CasperLabs claims that both those features are part of Highway and that their presence is provable. The firm also released a full <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/qcnjxswbcrnd">research paper</a> concerning the project.</p>
      <p>Casper is the name given to Ethereum’s PoS implementation and Highway — this particular version — has been released as open-source software. The first version of the protocol came <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/first-version-of-ethereums-casper-update-has-been-released">out</a> in May of last year.</p>
      <h3>Open source Casper implementation</h3>
      <p>Per the announcement, the firm announced the development at the San Francisco Blockchain Week on Oct. 31. The company noted:</p>
      <blockquote>“By releasing CasperLabs Highway to the public via an open source license, we hope to inspire further innovation for the benefit of all.”</blockquote>
      <p>During the event, CasperLabs lead software developer Michael Birch also reportedly led a developer’s workshop illustrating how to write smart contracts in Rust (a programming language) for use with CasperLabs.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-startup-casperlabs-raises-145m-for-scaling-development">reported</a> in September, CasperLabs raised $14.5 million in a Series A funding round led by Terren Piezer, an international financier and chairman of Los Angeles-based investment company Acuitas Group Holdings.</p>
