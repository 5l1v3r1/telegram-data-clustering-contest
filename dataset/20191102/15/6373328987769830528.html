      <h1>Couple Steal Cat Thinking It’s Missing Pet And The Outcome Is Hilarious</h1>

        <b>Social media can be a powerful tool when it comes to spreading the word about important things, whether it’s crowdfunding for charity or searching for a missing pet.</b>

      <p>So when Sophie Johnson took to Facebook to appeal for helpers in searching for her missing cat, Lentil, Lauren Faulkner and her boyfriend Charlie Allan were more than happy to oblige.</p>
      <p>Sophie pleaded for help when someone reported seeing a ‘really muddy’ cat who looked a lot like Lentil in Prestonpans, Edinburgh, but she wasn’t able to get there and have a look for herself.</p>

      <p>On seeing her post, Lauren and Charlie decided to be good Samaritans by going out looking for Lentil themselves, and they were overjoyed when they spotted a beautiful rag doll cat who matched Lentil’s description.</p>
      <p>‘MATE, WE’VE F*CKING GOT HIM,’ Lauren texted Sophie, telling her the good news.</p>
      <p>‘Omg, hahahahaha send pics,’ Sophie replied. ‘Omg I’m shaking, OMG is it actually him? I can’t believe it man.’</p>

      <p>However, things took a turn for the worse when a woman approached Lauren and Charlie, who were putting the cat in their car, to tell them they were actually abducting the wrong cat.</p>
      <p>Advertisements</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lauren told <i>UNILAD</i>:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>The lady told us, ‘Just so you know, that’s not the right cat, he’s been living here for about a year. I’ve heard about the missing cat but I can point you in the direction of the owner’s house if you want’.<br/><br/>She was lovely, we were having a laugh about it because I was mortified.</blockquote>

      <p><b>After realising their mistake, Lauren took to Twitter to share their hilarious mishap, telling her followers</b>:</p>
      <blockquote>Canny believe me and Charlie went out to look for Sophie’s cat earlier and we STOLE THE WRONG CAT.</blockquote>
      <p>As if that wasn’t funny enough, one of Lauren’s followers shared a screenshot of a message from the owner of Lentil’s lookalike, and it’s fair to say she was less than amused by the couple’s mishap.</p>
      <p>Advertisements</p>
      <p>
        <b>Writing on a local Prestonpan Facebook page, the owner wrote: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Someone just tried to steal our Railey ragdoll cat. Luckily to our wonderful neighbours it was prevented. We are aware of a missing cat who looks a little like ours and we are sorry for the owners but turning up at someone’s home and trying to steal an animal is an appalling and cowardly act.</blockquote>

        <b>Fortunately, Lauren could see the funny side, explaining:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>A mean we didn’t run about in f*cking balaclavas nor getting wrestled to the ground while trying to abduct the cat.<br/><br/>Some c*nt went ‘that’s not the right cat by the way’ and I let it out and we all laughed.<br/><br/>Everyone lock your cats up we are clearly very dangerous.</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>The makeup artist added:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>A chapped her door earlier by the way because the neighbour told me where she lived to apologise for the confusion, but she didn’t answer, am no coward.</blockquote>

      <p>At the end of the day, Lauren and Charlie were only trying to do a good deed when they found the cat – I doubt they’re on a mission to abduct all the cats in Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>On a serious note, Lentil is still missing, so keep your eyes peeled in Prestonpans for a gorgeous little ragdoll cat who answers to the name Lentil. Here’s to hoping Sophie is reunited with her fur baby soon. If you see him, contact <a href="https://twitter.com/sophxjohnson">Sophie on Twitter</a>.</p>
