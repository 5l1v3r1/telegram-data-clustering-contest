      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/pink">Pink</a> has recounted the time Robin Williams performed an impromptu stand-up comedy routine to cheer her up after failing to win a Grammy in 2003.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8541474/pink-billboard-cover-story-interview-2019">new interview with <i>Billboard</i></a>, the artist goes back to the night she was up for two awards at the event in 2003, for ‘M!ssundaztood’ and ‘Get The Party Started’. After losing out to <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/norah-jones">Norah Jones</a>, the ‘Just Give Me a Reason’ singer broke down in tears, before receiving some attention from another attendee sat in front of her.</p>
      <p>“I was with Carey, and I was holding on to his arm so fucking tight because I wanted it so bad,” she explained in the interview. She then broke down over the snub, with Williams turning around and launching into “a 15-minute stand-up routine for me” to distract her from the disappointment.</p>

      <p>“He made fun of everybody that walked by. He was so compassionate and lovely to me that it ended up being one of my favourite moments of my career.”</p>
      <p>The singer concluded the memory was better than actually winning the Grammy. “I was so glad I fucking lost,” she added to Billboard. “My Grammy would be sitting down at my guesthouse collecting dust, but I have the memory of Robin Williams being an amazing person.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/fan-gives-birth-pink-liverpool-concert-baby-2517626">Pink was in the news this year (June 27) after a fan who went into labour at her concert in Liverpool</a>, successfully giving birth at the venue – and named the newborn after the pop star herself.</p>
      <p>As the artist kickstarted the night at Anfield with ‘Get The Party Started’, Denise Jones went into labour, reported the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-fans-deliver-baby-kop-16488996"><i>Liverpool Echo</i></a>. Two medics, who were on duty as crowd doctors on the night, rushed to her side and took her to the stadium’s first aid room, where they delivered the baby.</p>
      <p>Though Jones initially planned to name her child Dolly Louise, she changed her mind and chose Dolly Pink instead. “I’m still massively in shock, just a bit gutted I missed the concert,” she joked to the <i>Echo</i>.</p>
