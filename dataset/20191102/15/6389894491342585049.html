      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has labelled the halt to fracking as “an election stunt” by the government.</p>
      <p>The suspension came following scientific research raised fresh concerns that the risk of earthquakes was linked to fracking – a controversial method for extracting shale gas.</p>

      <p>Corbyn has called the U-turn by the Conservative Party an effort to “win a few votes”.</p>
      <p>The leader of the opposition said the Prime Minister could not be trusted over fracking and that Boris Johnson once called fracking “glorious news for humanity”.</p>
      <p>On Twitter, he wrote: “The Conservatives’ temporary pause of fracking is an election stunt to try and win a few votes.</p>
      <p>“Boris Johnson described fracking as ‘glorious news for humanity’. We cannot trust him.</p>
      <p>“Labour would ban fracking. That’s real change.”</p>
      <p>The report by the Oil and Gas Authority found it is not possible to accurately predict the strength of earthquakes connected to fracking operations.</p>
      <p>The method for extracting shale gas has caused seen protests across the country including in Lancashire and Yorkshire following tremors believed to be caused by the fracking process.</p>
      <p>It was likely to be a prominent feature of the general election campaign.</p>
      <p>Business secretary Andrea Leadsom said the ban was only in place “until the science changes”.</p>
      <p>Former energy secretary and Liberal Democrat Sir Ed Davey has also demanded an “immediate ban now” on fracking.</p>
      <p>He said: “This belated, eve of election policy pause won’t distract voters from the Tories’ shocking record on the environment – not least the prime minister’s, when he lobbied to relax air pollution laws.”</p>

      <p>Prime Minister Johnson had previously argued energy companies “should leave no stone unturned, or unfracked” as he dismissed opposition to the methods as “ludicrous” and “mad denunciations”.</p>
      <p>He has since said he has “very considerable anxieties” about fracking.</p>
