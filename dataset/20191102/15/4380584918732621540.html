      <h1>Will the Yankees need to find a new closer?</h1>

      <p>NEW YORK -- Aroldis Chapman’s final pitch of the 2019 season was slugged over the left-field wall at Minute Maid Park, securing the American League pennant for José Altuve and the Astros. Could his next be in a different uniform?</p>
      <p>Chapman has until 12:01 a.m. ET on Sunday to determine if he will opt out of the remaining two years and $30 million on the five-year, $86 million pact he signed with the Yankees prior to the 2017 season. Chapman, who turns 32 in February, is believed to be interested in an extension.</p>
      <p>Should Chapman opt out, the Yankees are almost certain to issue him a qualifying offer valued at $17.8 million for one year. Chapman would likely reject that, ensuring that New York could receive Draft compensation in the event he signs elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Despite serving up Altuve’s walk-off homer in Game 6 of the AL Championship Series, Chapman enjoyed a productive season in which he was selected as an All-Star for the sixth time in his career (second in the AL) and honored with the Mariano Rivera Award as the AL’s top reliever.</p>
      <p>Chapman posted a 2.21 ERA in 60 appearances this season and converted 37 of 42 save opportunities. He ranked fourth among AL relievers with a 13.42 K/9.0 IP ratio (85 strikeouts in 57 innings). Chapman struck out 36.2 percent of the 235 batters he faced.</p>
      <p>In July, Chapman denied a report that suggested he had already decided to opt out of his contract. Asked about his clause in the wake of the ALCS loss to Houston, Chapman replied: “That’s a topic for another time.”</p>
      <p>The Yankees could absorb a potential Chapman departure by elevating left-hander Zack Britton to the closer’s role, heading a still-strong group that projects to include Chad Green, Tommy Kahnle and Adam Ottavino.</p>
      <p>It has been suggested that they could incorporate those salary savings into the pursuit of starting pitching, with right-hander Gerrit Cole standing tall as the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/ranking-top-2020-mlb-free-agents">most prized target of the offseason</a>.</p>
      <p>In his end-of-season press conference, general manager Brian Cashman characterized Chapman’s situation as “sensitive.”</p>
      <p>“He'll have decisions to make,” Cashman said. “That date is coming, and we'll see what happens between now and then. I don't want to speculate on alternative options when I currently don't have to. I don’t think that's healthy to the process.”</p>
