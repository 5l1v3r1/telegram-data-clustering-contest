      <p>Knowles, a Grammy Award-winning musician, said she felt it necessary to make the announcement public in order to “protect the sacredness of my personal truth and to live in it fully just as I have before and will continue to do”.</p>
      <p>She said she is not perfect, but is “leaning into the fear of the unknown and all the glory and power i know exist within god and the universes (sic) grace”.</p>
      <p>Knowles added: “May all of your transitions no matter how big or small, be kind to you and filled with incredible love and light!”</p>
      <p>Knowles and Ferguson married at a ceremony in New Orleans in 2014, with older sister Beyonce and brother-in-law Jay-Z reportedly among the attendees.</p>
      <p>While her sibling is one of the most famous women in the world, Solange is a successful musician in her own right and won a Grammy in 2017 for best R&amp;B performance for the single Cranes In The Sky.</p>
      <p>In May 2014, CCTV captured her appearing to attack Jay-Z in a New York hotel lift, reportedly in a row over his alleged infidelity.</p>
