      <p>RENO, Nev. (AP) - Some Reno hotels are offering discounted room rates to people displaced by the California wildfires.</p>
      <p>The Reno Gazette Journal reports that the discounted rates go as low as $25 a night and will be offered until Nov. 30.</p>
      <p>CEO Phil DeLone of the Reno-Sparks Convention and Visitors Authority said many Reno-area residents know people affected by the California wildfires and blackouts and the discounted room rates are a way to help displaced people “to find a safe place that’s accessible and close to home.”</p>
