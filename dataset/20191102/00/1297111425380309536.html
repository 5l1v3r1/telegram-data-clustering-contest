      <h1>Rob Vanstone: Saskatchewan Roughriders cannot take any risks with Cody Fajardo</h1>
      <h2>Despite the magnitude of Saturday's game, the Riders should sit out quarterback Cody Fajardo to ensure his availability for the playoffs.</h2>

      <p>If there is even a sprinkle of doubt, sit him out.</p>
      <p>The Saskatchewan Roughriders’ brass must apply that mindset with respect to franchise quarterback <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/qb-cody-fajardo-tops-riders-depth-chart">Cody Fajardo, who has an injured oblique muscle.</a></p>
      <p>Yes, the Green and White can clinch first place in the CFL’s West Division by defeating the visiting Edmonton Eskimos on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Roughriders home games are rarely of such magnitude.</p>
      <p>Regardless, caution should rule the day.</p>
      <p>That was the unavoidable conclusion after listening to Fajardo and<a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-head-coach-craig-dickenson-scores-points-with-his-honesty"> head coach Craig Dickenson</a> on Friday.</p>
      <p>When asked about Fajardo’s status, Dickenson said: “I’m not overly optimistic, but we’re going to wait until tomorrow.”</p>
      <p>“If the game were today,” Fajardo added, “I would not be able to play.”</p>
      <p>Can that much change, beneficially, in one day?</p>
      <p>Forging ahead with Fajardo would seem to be fraught with excessive risk.</p>
      <p>Conveniently enough, the Eskimos are already taking precautions in advance of a game that, for them, does not have a bearing on the playoff picture. Quarterback Trevor Harris is among the front-line Edmonton players who will be rested on Saturday.</p>
      <p>With Harris out of the equation, the Roughriders are unlikely to find themselves in an aerial battle. So they may very well be able to get by with <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/riders-backup-qb-isaac-harker-is-ready-to-go-if-needed">rookie Isaac Harker making his first professional start.</a></p>
      <p>If not, well, there will be other battles — the first of which will be a home playoff game, regardless of what transpires on Saturday.</p>
      <p>As of this writing, it does seem like a stretch to imagine that Fajardo will be behind centre in a matter of hours.</p>
      <p>The pain, by his description, is “pretty tremendous.” That has been the case since early in Wednesday’s practice.</p>
      <p>“I threw a deep ball to my left to <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/manny-arceneaux-following-geroy-simons-footsteps-with-saskatchewan-roughriders">Manny (Arceneaux)</a> and found myself on my knees on the ground,” Fajardo said.</p>
      <p>“I felt like I got stabbed.”</p>
      <p>Roughriders fans also recoiled upon hearing the news, especially with a high-stakes game looming.</p>
      <p>A victory would give Saskatchewan first place in the West Division for the first time since 2009, and only the second time in a span of 43 seasons.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 7, 2009, the Roughriders downed the Calgary Stampeders 30-14 at Taylor Field to secure top spot, along with hosting privileges for the division final. That was the first, and heretofore only, time in Roughriders history that they nailed down first place with a home-field victory on the final weekend of regular-season play.</p>
      <p>Five previous times, Saskatchewan had a chance to clinch first place by winning its regular-season finale, but each of those games was played on the road.</p>
      <p>The Roughriders lost in 1951, but still claimed first place as the result of a tie-breaking procedure.</p>
      <p>Road wins delivered first place in 1966 and 1976. Losses in 1971 and 1973 relegated Saskatchewan to second.</p>
      <p>And now, it makes eminent good sense for Fajardo to be third — on the quarterbacking depth chart, behind Harker and <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-backup-quarterback-bryan-bennett-making-a-name-for-himself-on-special-teams">Bryan Bennett.</a></p>
      <p>In a magical season for the team, the injury to Fajardo is unquestionably a blow.</p>
      <p>But it need not be fatal, as long as all precautions are taken.</p>
