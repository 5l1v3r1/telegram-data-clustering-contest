      <p>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Indiana is appealing a federal judge’s ruling that ordered the release of a man convicted in the 2000 killing of an Indiana University student.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Curtis Hill’s office filed a notice of intent Wednesday to appeal the judge’s September ruling vacating John Myers II’s murder conviction.</p>
      <p>The judge found that Myers’ trial attorney was so ineffective his Sixth Amendment rights were violated.</p>
      <p>The now 43-year-old Myers was convicted in 2006 in the fatal shooting of 19-year-old Jill Behrman and sentenced to 65 years. Behrman vanished in May 2000 after leaving her Bloomington home for a bike ride. Hunters found her remains in 2003.</p>
      <p>Morgan County Prosecutor Steve Sonnega tells The Herald-Times he expects it will be months before the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Court of Appeals rules on the matter.</p>
