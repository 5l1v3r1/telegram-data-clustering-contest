      <p>CHENEY, Wash. (AP) - Eric Barriere threw for 367 yards and three touchdowns, ran for 101 and another score and Eastern Washington overwhelmed Northern Arizona 66-38 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Antoine Custer ran for 139 yards and three touchdowns as the Eagles (4-5, 3-2 Big Sky Conference) piled up 706 yards, the fifth most in school history behind the record 769 from a win over Lindenwood earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Barriere went 29 of 38 for his seventh 300-yard game and ran the ball 10 times. He also caught a 20-yard pass. Talolo Limu-Jones had eight receptions for 147 yards, including a 75-yard touchdown.</p>
      <p>The Lumberjacks (4-5, 2-3) were leading 14-10 when Custer capped three-straight drives with touchdowns and EWU went up 31-14.</p>
      <p>The teams swapped scores after that until Andrew Katzenberg followed a Barriere TD pass with a 77-yard fumble return to give EWU a 59-31 lead heading into the fourth quarter.</p>
