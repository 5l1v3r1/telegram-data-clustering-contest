      <h1>Edward Snowden, NSA leaker, says ‘common-sense’ keeping hi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T00:00:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/andrew-blake/" target="_blank">Andrew Blake</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edward-snowden/">Edward Snowden</a> opened up Friday as to why the fugitive former U.S. government contractor has largely avoided speaking to media outlets in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a> since he started living there.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edward-snowden/">Mr. Snowden</a> indicated in a public Twitter exchange that he is concerned about the consequences that could potentially result from receiving heightened coverage in the Russian press.</p>
      <p>“Someone facing serious threats may not want their face all over newspapers and TV every day in the place they live,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edward-snowden/">Mr. Snowden</a> answered in response to a related question posed by a Twitter user who claims to work for a Russian newspaper.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edward-snowden/">Mr. Snowden</a> stated that he is not avoiding “Russian press,” but rather exercising “common-sense”</p>
      <p>“I prefer privacy and liberty to celebrity and daily metro encounters,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edward-snowden/">Mr. Snowden</a> tweeted. “Please respect that and leave me be.”</p>

      <p>“I only want to retain the little space I have left,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edward-snowden/">Mr. Snowden</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1190303639702769664">added</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edward-snowden/">Mr. Snowden</a>, 36, was charged by the Department of Justice in June 2013 in connection with disclosing classified government material to the media that he had accessed while working as a contractor for the U.S. National Security Agency, or NSA, including documents detailing the government’s vast surveillance operations domestically and abroad.</p>
      <p>His passport was accordingly canceled by the U.S. State Department, which resulted in him being stranded at a Moscow airport amid attempting to travel from Hong Kong to Latin America. He was subsequently granted asylum by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a> and has lived in the country ever since.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edward-snowden/">Mr. Snowden</a> has been critical of the Russian government and its policies since receiving asylum, and he recently said he would return to the U.S. if he thought he would receive a fair trial.</p>

        <p>He has hardly tried lately to avoid media attention abroad, however. He has given myriad interviews to media outlets in the U.S. in recent months to promote “Permanent Record,” a memoir he released in mid-September, including a recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast where he discussed his ongoing residency in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/">Russia</a>.</p>
        <p>“It does not make my life easier to be trapped in a country that I did not choose,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edward-snowden/">Mr. Snowden</a> said in the interview while appearing remotely from Moscow.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department has charged <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edward-snowden/">Mr. Snowden</a> with counts of espionage and theft of government property. He faces decades behind bars if he returns to the U.S. and convicted.</p>
