      <p>BAMAKO, Mali (AP) - The Malian government says at least 54 people are dead following a jihadist attack on the army in the north.</p>
      <p>The revised death toll from government spokesman Yaya Sangare came a day after the military initially announced at least 15 dead following Friday’s attack in the Menaka region.</p>
      <p>The new violence is expected to further raise tensions in the capital, Bamako, where military families have already protested in the streets.</p>
      <p>Relatives say that soldiers are not being adequately protected on the ground as they face an array of jihadist groups.</p>
