      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 2 — Democrat Beto O’Rourke announced yesterday he is dropping out of the crowded race for the 2020 US presidential nomination, after months of stagnant polling numbers and dwindling finances.</p>
      <p>“Though it is difficult to accept, it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully,” the former congressman said in a statement. “My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee.”</p>
      <p>The charismatic 47-year-old Texan entered the contest with considerable buzz after narrowly losing a US Senate bid to Republican incumbent Ted Cruz in 2018, a race that saw him raise staggering amounts of campaign donations.</p>
      <p>When he launched his presidential bid in March, O’Rourke was viewed as one of the 2020 frontrunners, but on the national stage he failed to re-ignite the enthusiasm that had propelled him to rockstar status in his Senate race in Texas.</p>
      <p>Polling at about two per cent in recent months — far behind frontrunners Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders — his performance rarely moved the needle.</p>
      <p>O’Rourke’s campaign team ruled out another Senate run, at least for now.</p>
      <p>“Beto will not be a candidate for US Senate in Texas in 2020,” communications director Rob Friedlander told AFP.</p>
      <p>O’Rourke has been a fierce critic of President Donald Trump, openly branding him a “racist” who is motivated by white supremacist views.</p>
      <p>Minutes after O’Rourke’s announcement, Trump mocked his critic and political adversary in a tweet.</p>
      <p>“Oh no, Beto just dropped out of race for President despite him saying he was ‘born for this.’ I don’t think so!” Trump said.</p>
      <p>O’Rourke had expressed particular anger towards Trump after a horrific shooting in his Texas hometown of El Paso in early August, saying the massacre was a “consequence” of Trump’s hostile rhetoric towards immigrants.</p>
      <p>One of O’Rourke’s signature policy issues was curbing gun violence, and after the tragedy in El Paso, where a gunman slaughtered 22 people using a military-style assault weapon, O’Rourke doubled down on his call for a mandatory gun buyback program.</p>
      <p>“Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,” he said during a Democratic debate in September in one of the more passionate and memorable moments of his campaign. — AFP</p>
