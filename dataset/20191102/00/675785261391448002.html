      <h2>The Strictly Come Dancing head judge says it's her responsibility to persuade younger women not to go under the knife</h2>

      <p>Shirley Ballas is thrilled with her smaller boobs after having her implants removed - urging younger women to avoid going under the knife for the procedure.</p>
      <p>The Strictly Come Dancing head judge is due back on the dance floor tonight after undergoing the 4½-hour operation due to cancer fears.</p>
      <p>Shirley, who is finally accepting her natural body shape for the first time, had her DD implants removed.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10262340/shirley-ballas-boob-job-operation/">The Sun</a> : "When I saw my little boobies I thought, 'I'm myself again'".</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old said that when she looked in the mirror for the first time after having her breast implants removed, she said: "I'm glad they are gone."</p>

      <p>Shirley went under the knife in a gruelling operation to remove her augmentation after a potentially dangerous capsule had grown unexpectedly.</p>
      <p>She made the choice to revert to her natural A cup boobs because of a risk of cancer in her family, and is determined to share her story to make young women think twice before going under the knife.</p>
      <p>An emotional Shirley admitted: "When I saw my little boobies, I thought, ‘There she is’. They’re lovely. They’re all a bit swollen but I’m pleased with the breast lift he gave me. And now I’m in the process of learning to love myself after all those years."</p>

      <p>And the star also confessed if she could go back to her younger self, she wouldn't have gone under the knife,saying she is "relieved" after having them removed.</p>
      <p>But despite the surgery, Shirley will be returning to tonight's episode of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> against the explicit orders of her surgeon.</p>
      <p>She feels it's important to be open about the intimate procedure, saying: "You can't go into work with a DD boob one day then have an A or B the following week and pretend you never had implants."</p>
