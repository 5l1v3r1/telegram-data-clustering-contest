      <p>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) - Vice President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-pence/">Mike Pence</a> made a campaign swing through Virginia on Saturday to try to shore up support for Republicans as they try to maintain control of the state legislature in Tuesday’s election.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-pence/">Pence</a> was surrounded by Republicans in a middle school gym in Virginia Beach, where a crowd of about 900 people chanted “USA!” and “Trump!”, The Washington Post reported .</p>
      <p>The GOP holds a slim majority in Virginia’s General Assembly.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-pence/">Pence</a> called Virginia’s election and governor’s races in Kentucky and Mississippi a referendum on the Trump administration. He said the administration has made the country stronger, safer and more prosperous.</p>
      <p>“It’s great to get the vice president in Virginia Beach in the final days of the campaign to help inspire Trump voters to come out,” said conservative radio host John Fredericks, a member of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s 2020 advisory board.</p>

      <p>Democrats predicted <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-pence/">Pence</a>’s appearance will “be a huge help” to them in winning majorities in the House of Delegates and Senate. Voter unhappiness with Trump helped Democrats flip 15 House seats in 2017.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-pence/">Pence</a> visited an aluminum and steel manufacturing plant in Louisa County, WVIR-TV reported .</p>
      <p>During the event, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-pence/">Pence</a> promoted the USMCA treaty that has been negotiated as a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
      <p>Mexico’s Senate has ratified the agreement, but U.S. lawmakers have yet to do so.</p>

        <p>“At a time when we see endless investigations and a partisan impeachment, this is a time for Democrats in Congress that represent Virginia to put politics aside,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-pence/">Pence</a> said. “Put jobs, and workers, and agriculture, and Virginia first, and represent the USMCA.”</p>
        <p>The rally was held in the district of U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who helped flip Republican seats to the Democratic column in 2018.</p>
        <p>“I stand ready to keep working with the administration to expand export opportunities for our district’s small businesses, manufacturers and farmers,” Spanberger said in a statement, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch .</p>
