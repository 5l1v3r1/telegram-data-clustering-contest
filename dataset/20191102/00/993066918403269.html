      <p>Strictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas admitted her regret over having breast implants as she warned other women to think twice before going under the knife.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old reportedly spent four-and-a-half hours on the operating table this week, to have her breast augmentation reversed and a potentially dangerous capsule removed.</p>
      <p>Ballas said she decided to revert back to her natural A cup because of health concerns and finally being able to accept her natural body.</p>

      <p>And, in an interview with The Sun, she warned other women to “do your research” before having surgery.</p>
      <p>She told the newspaper: “Don’t do what I did and think you need to have these procedures to make you look more attractive.</p>
      <p>“Don’t look at the implant and think it will make you beautiful and everyone will really love you.</p>
      <p>“Do your research. I did not do mine. I thought if I put them in I would look better and my husband would think of me as more desirable. But I didn’t know  about the capsule.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know so many things.”</p>
      <p>Ballas, who said she will return to her head judge role on Strictly for Saturday night’s episode, added: “If I could go back to my younger self, I would never have had the implants done. I feel relieved and I feel proud for removing them now.”</p>
      <p>Breast enlargement surgery, commonly referred to as a “boob job”, is a procedure where implants are inserted into the breasts to increase their size, change their shape or make them more even.</p>
      <p>Potential risks include thick, obvious scarring, rippling of the implant and nerve problems in the nipples, according to official NHS advice.</p>
