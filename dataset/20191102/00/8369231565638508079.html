      <h1>This Eyeball-Looking Thing Is One of The Biggest Single-Celled Organisms</h1>

      <p>Throughout the world's oceans, hidden in coral rubble, you can find strange blobs of various sizes. Named sailor's eyeballs (<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valonia_ventricosa">Valonia ventricose</a></i>) these squishy balls are actually an incredibly cool type of algae – they're one of the largest unicellular organisms in the world.</p>
      <p>Indeed, that whole ball is a single cell. Now, that's not the size we'd usually associate with unicellular organisms, but sailor's eyeballs have some neat tricks up their sleeve to help them grow that big.</p>
      <p>To start with, we need to fess up - not all of these organisms are quite as large as the one in the picture above. They can range in size from as small as a ball bearing, all the way up to their namesake, the eyeball.</p>

      <p>High-school biology classes may have informed you that cells simply can't grow that big, as there's diffusion to worry about - making something too large will mess up the <a href="https://biowithvalerie.wordpress.com/2012/07/28/how-big-can-a-cell-get/">surface-area-to-volume ratio</a>.</p>
      <p>But, although sailor's eyeballs are one cell, they contain several cytoplasmic domains, each with their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenocyte">own nucleus</a> and chloroplasts.</p>

      <p>This peculiar structure means that if you tried to pop it, it wouldn't just go bust like a balloon full of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle">organelles</a>. In fact, squashing one sailor's eyeball can cause more of them to spring up, since the organisms only need to possess one nucleus to grow into an entirely new eyeball.</p>
      <p>So, there's your cool fact for the day. Although these strange beady things with their myriad nuclei can cause problems for <a href="http://www.aquaristsonline.com/blog/general/oh-not-another-problem-sailors-eyeballs/">aquarium enthusiasts</a>, in nature they'll happily live out their sea-faring life <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljezQMYQPfg">wowing divers</a> and scientists alike.</p>
