      <blockquote>The former Texas lawmaker did not move to endorse a fellow Democratic candidate, but instead asserted that he "will work to ensure that the Democratic nominee is successful in defeating Donald Trump in 2020."</blockquote>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/us/politics/beto-orourke-drops-out.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">New York Times</a>, which broke the story approximately three minutes before O'Rourke's announcement via Twitter, he initially planned to announce his withdrawal from the primary later on Friday evening. </p>
      <p>It's unclear whether this will actually be O'Rourke's final bid for elected office, but he did recently inform <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/10/15/beto-orourke-gun-debate-229849">Politico</a> that he may not run again. </p>
      <blockquote>“I cannot fathom a scenario where I would run for public office again if I’m not the nominee,” O'Rourke told the outlet last month.  </blockquote>
      <p>Fellow candidates billionaire <a href="https://twitter.com/TomSteyer/status/1190384887230091264">Tom Steyer</a>, former US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development <a href="https://twitter.com/JulianCastro/status/1190386764705419266">Julián Castro</a> and Democratic Senators <a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris">Kamala Harris</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CoryBooker/status/1190389040694083585">Cory Booker</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1190388601210716163">Elizabeth Warren</a> issued warm parting remarks to the former Texas lawmaker, but US President Donald Trump made it clear that there was no love lost. </p>

      <p>Speaking on his lack of "means to move foward," O'Rourke noted that he did not rely on "PACs or corporations but upon the grassroots volunteers and supporters from everywhere, especially from those places that had been overlooked or taken for granted." </p>
      <blockquote>Despite a lack of funding, O'Rourke was able to keep his name in the media over the past few months with polarizing comments concerning America being <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201907101076208311-orourke-us-founded-white-supremacy/">"founded on white supremacy,"</a> <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201908061076476931-democrats-blaming-trump-republicans-mass-shootings-el-paso-dayton/">Trump's anti-Mexican rhetoric</a> and opinions on the current administration. </blockquote>
