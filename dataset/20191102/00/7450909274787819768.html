      <p>Everybody and their brother wants to get on the year-end <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Ultimate-Fighting-Championship-2">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a> card.<br/><br/>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/arielhelwani/status/1189727218378903554">ESPN</a> late Thursday night, the promotion is looking to put together <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Geoff-Neal-72107">Geoff Neal</a> (12-2) vs. <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Mike-Perry-176179">Mike Perry</a> (13-5) at welterweight. That bout, like many other high-profile matchups including a whopping three title fights, is being targeted to take place at <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/events/UFC-245-Usman-vs-Covington-76607">UFC 245</a>. The event will take place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on Dec. 14.<br/><br/>Neal is riding a six-fight win streak with five finishes, and has stormed into the Octagon on the heels of an impressive contract-winning performance against <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Chase-Waldon-68408">Chase Waldon</a> at <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Dana-Whites-Contender-Series-12411">Dana White's Contender Series</a>, Season 1, Episode 3 in 2017. Since then, "Handz of Steel" has won each of his four UFC bouts, last stopping <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Niko-Price-96921">Niko Price</a> at UFC 240 and in the process, picked up his first post-fight bonus with the organization. The <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/stats/fightfinder?association=Fortis+MMA">Fortis MMA</a> product sports a 75 percent finish rate, and has never lost a fight on the scorecards.<br/><br/>Perry has alternates wins and losses in his last five outings, taking decisions over <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Paul-Felder-68205">Paul Felder</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Alex-Oliveira-110143">Alex Oliveira</a> while dropping three to <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Max-Griffin-53904">Max Griffin</a>, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Donald-Cerrone-15105">Donald Cerrone</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Vicente-Luque-66474">Vicente Luque</a>. The knockout artist from Florida came into the promotion with a 100 percent knockout rate until his two aforementioned decision victories. In his most recent bout against Luque, "Platinum" came out on the wrong end of a split decision and suffered a <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Mike-Perry-Undergoes-Successful-Surgery-to-Repair-Disfigured-Nose-Following-UFC-Uruguay-159939">tremendous amount of facial damage in the process</a>. After undergoing surgery, Perry was expected to be recovering until 2020, but this collision with Neal will bring him back in the 2019 calendar year.<br/><br/>UFC 245 takes place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on Dec. 14. The card will be headlined by a title trifecta, as <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Kamaru-Usman-120691">Kamaru Usman</a> defends his welterweight throne against <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Colby-Covington-57269">Colby Covington</a>. <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Max-Holloway-38671">Max Holloway</a> will also put his featherweight strap on the line against <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Alexander-Volkanovski-101527">Alexander Volkanovski</a>. Finally, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Amanda-Nunes-31496">Amanda Nunes</a> looks to cement her status as an all-time great female fighter when she tries to thwart the title aspirations of <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Germaine-de-Randamie-41745">Germaine de Randamie</a>.</p>
