      <p>CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) - Clemson starting defensive end Xavier Thomas is expected to miss a third consecutive game since suffering a concussion at practice last month.</p>
      <p>Tigers coach Dabo Swinney says Thomas has made significant progress since entering the concussion protocol before No. 4 Clemson’s 45-10 victory at Louisville three weeks ago. However, the team plans to hold him out Saturday against Wofford of the Football Championship Subdivision.</p>
      <p>Thomas had started four of the team’s first six games before getting hurt. The 6-foot-2, 265-pound sophomore from Florence is third on the Tigers with 4½ tackles for loss.</p>
      <p>Clemson (8-0) is looking for its 24th consecutive victory when it takes on Wofford (5-2).</p>
