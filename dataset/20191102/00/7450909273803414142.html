      <p><a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Ultimate-Fighting-Championship-2">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a> heavyweight <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Walt-Harris-72046">Walt Harris</a> has more important people to think about than <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Alistair-Overeem-461">Alistair Overeem</a> right now.<br/><br/>On Friday, <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/walt-harris-out-ufc-on-espn-7-dc-main-event-alistair-overeem">MMAJunkie reported</a> that Harris (13-7, 1 NC) would not be competing at <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/events/UFC-on-ESPN-7-Overeem-vs-Harris-76605">UFC on ESPN 7</a> on Dec. 7, as he continues to search for his missing stepdaughter Aniah Blanchard. This was later confirmed by <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/27981521/walt-harris-not-compete-ufc-washington-search-stepdaughter-continues">ESPN</a>, through Harris' manager Jason House. It is unclear if his opponent Overeem (45-17, 1 NC) will remain on the card.<br/><br/>Blanchard was reported missing on Oct. 31, and after a search her vehicle was recovered an hour away from her home in Auburn, Alabama. The vehicle showed damage, and with that coupled with additional evidence that the police discovered, Blanchard is <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Alabama-Governors-Office-Offers-Reward-for-Missing-Daughter-of-UFC-Fighter-Walt-Harris-164743">now considered to be a victim of foul play</a>. A criminal investigation to search for her and hold those responsible accountable is currently underway in the state of Alabama, and the Governor's office has issued a reward for information leading to the arrest and potential conviction of those involved. The police ask for anyone with information about Blanchard's whereabouts to call the Auburn Police Division Detective Section at 334-501-3140, the anonymous tip line at 334-246-1391 or the 24-hour non-emergency number at 334-501-3100.<br/><br/>Since that statement went out, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4SjpM1FXpZ/">several additional figures in the sport</a> including UFC President Dana White and current light heavyweight champ <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jon-Jones-27944">Jon Jones</a> have given their support put up additional money for the reward, which now totals upwards of $100,000 to find her.<br/><br/>Harris also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4GTQQGJOS4/">posted a video</a> on Sunday with his family asking for help in the efforts to find her. Donations can be made to help out through PayPal at FindAniahBlanchard@gmail.com.<br/><br/>Inside the Octagon, Harris is on a two-fight win streak, having knocked out <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Sergey-Spivak-179095">Sergey Spivak</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Alexey-Oleynik-2027">Alexey Oleynik</a> earlier this year. His prior win over <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Andrei-Arlovski-270">Andrei Arlovski</a> in December was overturned after Harris <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/%20/news/news/Walt-Harris-Accepts-4Month-USADA-Suspension-for-AntiDoping-Violation-153241">tested positive for a contaminated supplement</a>. All 13 of Harris' career victories have come by knockout within two rounds.</p>
