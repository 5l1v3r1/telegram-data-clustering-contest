      <p>ATHENS, Nov 2 ― Archaeologists in Greece have located a “major treasure” of Minoan origin in a Bronze Age settlement on a small island in the Libyan Sea, the culture ministry said yesterday.</p>
      <p>A team excavating on the tiny island of Chrysi south of Crete for over a decade have unearthed a 3,800-year-old Bronze Age compound containing gold jewels, glass beads and the remains of bronze talents, the common unit of value of ancient Greece.</p>
      <p>Some of the beads are of Egyptian origin, the culture ministry said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The archaeologists also found ancient fish tanks and large amounts of porphyry ― a prized purple pigment of the ancient world derived from sea snails, and later the colour exclusively reserved for Roman emperors.</p>
      <p>“The amount of broken shells found...show a very early Mediterranean production of porphyry dye,” the culture ministry said.</p>
      <p>The cache “constitutes one of the most important (Minoan treasures) ever found in Crete until now,” it added.</p>
      <p>The Minoan civilisation, a naval superpower of the Bronze Age era, flourished on Crete and other Aegean islands until about 1500 BCE. ― AFP-Relaxnews</p>
