      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - Actress and activist Jane Fonda spent a night in a local jail after her fourth arrest in as many weeks while participating in a climate change demonstration on Capitol Hill.</p>
      <p>The 81-year-old Oscar winner was among more than 40 people arrested Friday while sitting in the atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building. A spokesman for Fire Drill Fridays, Ira Arlook, says Fonda was the only one who spent the night in jail, her first as part of the ongoing demonstration.</p>
      <p>Arlook says Fonda appeared in Superior Court about 1 p.m. Saturday and was released.</p>
