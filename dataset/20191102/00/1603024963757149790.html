      <p>Investors are in discussion with <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-private-sector/yesbank/YB">Yes Bank</a> to pump in capital of around $3 billion, the bank said on November 1.</p>
      <p>The bank had disclosed that one of the investors in discussion for $1.2 billion capital is a family office in the US.</p>
      <p>The capital adequacy ratio of the bank has dipped in the last few quarters due to the accelerated recognition of non-performing assets(NPAs) under chief executive, Ravneet Gill.</p>

      <p>Gill said the bank has received a binding bid from the multi-billion North America-based family office that has never invested in India.</p>
      <p>The bank is also in discussions to raise $1.6 billion from a clutch of six global private equity funds and two domestic mutual funds, as per Gill.</p>
      <p>Apart from that, it is in touch with two groups of domestic investors to raise $300 million, he said, adding that this includes two family offices and two financial investors.</p>
      <p>"We have $3 billion of potential money which can come in and will be looking at all the options with an open mind," Gill said.</p>
      <p>He said the bank may opt for either a single investor or multiple investors participating in the fundraiser.</p>
      <p>The bank needs the money quickly, he said, hinting that two tech investors that the bank is speaking with may not participate immediately.</p>
      <p>Its common equity tier-I capital buffer will go up by 2.60 percent over the 8.7 percent in September 2019 if the $1.2 billion funds come in, he added.</p>
      <p>Gill had replaced the promoter-chief executive Rana Kapoor early this year.</p>
      <p>Gill said the bank disclosed the $1.2 billion binding offer on October 31 because it found it to be price-sensitive, and added that both market regulator, SEBI, and RBI are in the loop.</p>
