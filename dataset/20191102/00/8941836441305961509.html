      <p>RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brazil/">Brazil</a> says small amounts of oil from a spill along the northeast coast have reached a national marine park.</p>
      <p>Naval and environmental officials said Saturday that oil traces were removed from Santa Barbara Island in the Abrolhos park in the state of Bahia.</p>
      <p>Santa Barbara is among five islands in the Abrolhos park, which contains one of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brazil/">Brazil</a>’s largest coral reefs. There were no reports that oil had reached the reef.</p>
      <p>Oil has washed ashore on some 2,100 kilometers (1,300 miles) of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brazil/">Brazil</a>’s coastline for two months, hurting tourism and fishing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brazil/">Brazil</a> says the oil is Venezuelan and came from a Greek-flagged ship belonging to Delta Tankers Ltd.</p>
