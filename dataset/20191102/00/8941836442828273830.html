      <p>BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) - Five Montana hospitals are settling a lawsuit that claimed they made a deal with an insurer to inflate employee health coverage prices in return for $26 million.</p>
      <p>The hospitals, which deny wrongdoing, agreed to pay $6.9 million to employees to resolve the case, The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bozeman-health/">Bozeman</a> Daily Chronicle reported Saturday. A U.S. District Court judge in Great Falls preliminarily approved the settlement Oct. 17, and notices were sent last week to thousands of hospital employees who could be entitled to the money.</p>
      <p>The complaint says the hospitals agreed in 2012 to exclusively buy employee health insurance plans from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/blue-crossblue-shield/">Blue Cross Blue Shield</a> of Montana for six years in exchange for about $26 million and two seats on the insurer’s board of directors.</p>
      <p>The hospitals involved include Bozeman Health Deaconess Hospital, Billings Clinic, St. Peter’s Health in Helena, Community Medical Center in Missoula and Northern Montana Hospital in Havre.</p>
      <p>In individual statements Friday, hospitals said they took the money to benefit their employees and that the settlement avoids an expensive lawsuit.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bozeman-health/">Bozeman Health</a> officials disagreed that the hospital should have invested the money from Blue Cross in its employees immediately, saying it used the funds as a reserve for its health plans to keep employees’ premiums low.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bozeman-health/">Bozeman Health</a> continues to prioritize the health, safety, and wellness of all <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bozeman-health/">Bozeman Health</a> employees and patients, and we’re pleased to have settled this matter,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>John Doran with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/blue-crossblue-shield/">Blue Cross Blue Shield</a> of Montana said the insurer can’t comment on the case because it’s not a defendant.</p>
      <p>The complaint was filed in 2017 on behalf of eight hospital workers who claimed the hospitals “attempted to - and did - profit at the expense of the plans and the participants.”</p>

        <p>A hearing on the final approval of the settlement is scheduled for Dec. 11. If approved, the hospitals will be protected from any further litigation related to the claims.</p>
