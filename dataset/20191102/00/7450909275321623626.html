      <p>It took a little bit longer than expected, but Legacy Fighting Alliance has found a broadcast home with UFC Fight Pass.<br/><br/>The news was announced during the UFC 244 broadcast on Saturday night. The deal will begin with LFAâ€™s final two events of 2019, which are set for Nov. 15 in Belton, Texas, and Nov. 22 in Broomfield, Colo.<br/><br/>LFA held 77 events over the course of 32 months on AXS TV before the network <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/AXS-TV-Ends-Broadcast-Deal-With-Legacy-Fighting-Alliance-161749">announced</a> in September that it was ending its broadcast arrangement with the Texas-based promotion, effectively immediately.<br/><br/>As a result of that decision, LFA was forced to <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Legacy-Fighting-Alliance-Postpones-Two-October-Events-While-Seeking-New-Broadcast-Partner-162559">postpone a pair of October events</a>. LFA 76 and LFA 77, which took place on Sept. 13 and Sept. 27, respectively, did not air live in any capacity.<br/><br/>LFA 78 features a bantamweight clash pitting <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Adrian-Yanez-86354">Adrian Yanez</a> against <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Kyle-Estrada-139131">Kyle Estrada</a>, while LFA 79 is headlined by a flyweight championship tilt between <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Brandon-Royval-83851">Brandon Royval</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jared-Scoggins-232801">Jared Scoggins</a>.</p>
