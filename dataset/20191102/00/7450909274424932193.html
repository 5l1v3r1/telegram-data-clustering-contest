      <p>Prior to the <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/events/UFC-245-Usman-vs-Covington-76607">UFC 245</a> press conference on Friday, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Ultimate-Fighting-Championship-2">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a> President Dana White has unveiled the BMF belt that will be awarded this Saturday.<br/><br/>At <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/events/UFC-244-Masvidal-vs-Diaz-76599">UFC 244</a> this weekend, welterweights <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jorge-Masvidal-7688">Jorge Masvidal</a> (34-13) and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Nate-Diaz-11451">Nate Diaz</a> (20-11) will collide to see who takes home the BMF title. Putting the belt around the waist of the winner will be Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Although the title holds no championship merit, the promotion spent upwards of $50,000 to create this trophy for the winner of this bout.<br/><br/>The organization stated that this would be a one-off, although UFC Fight Pass has cobbled together a series of <a href="https://twitter.com/UFCFightPass/status/1181298146426675200">"BMF Resume"</a> collections for other fighters including <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Justin-Gaethje-46648">Justin Gaethje</a>, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Tony-Ferguson-31239">Tony Ferguson</a>, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Robbie-Lawler-2245">Robbie Lawler</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Donald-Cerrone-15105">Donald Cerrone</a>. Former two-division champ <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Conor-McGregor-29688">Conor McGregor</a> has also <a href="https://twitter.com/TheNotoriousMMA/status/1190358773233258501">chimed in on social media</a>, stating that he wants the belt "spit shined." Additionally, <a href="https://twitter.com/BWWings/status/1188894103129473026">Buffalo Wild Wings</a> has created a new kind of sauce called "BMF Sauce" in honor of this event.</p>
