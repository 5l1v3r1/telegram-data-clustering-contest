      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday suggested he could sign a long-awaited trade agreement with China in the farm state of Iowa, which has been hard hit by tariffs in a nearly 16-month trade war between the world’s largest economies.</p>

      <p>Trump said on Friday evening that negotiations about a “phase one” agreement were going well and he hoped to sign the deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a U.S. location when work on the agreement was completed.</p>
      <p>“We’re looking at a different couple of locations. It could even be in Iowa,” he told reporters at the White House. “We’re discussing locations, but I like to get deals done first.”</p>
      <p>Trump and Xi had been expected to ink the agreement at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Santiago, Chile from Nov. 16-17, but those plans were thrown into disarray on Wednesday when Chile withdrew as host of the meeting.</p>
      <p>Trump said he would prefer to sign the agreement in the United States. “I would do it in the U.S.,” he said. Asked if Xi would too, Trump said: “He would too.”</p>
      <p>He said Iowa, a key state in the 2020 presidential election in early February, would be a good location.</p>
      <p>“We’re thinking about Iowa, you know why, because it would be the largest order in history for farmers. So to me, Iowa makes sense. I love Iowa. It’s a possibility,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>Trump won the 2016 presidential election in Iowa with 51.1% of the vote, compared to 41.7% for Democrat Hillary Clinton.</p>
      <p>The president carried Iowa by the largest margin of any Republican candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1980.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear whether China would agree to sign the trade deal in the United States.</p>
      <p>Xi is no stranger to the farm state.</p>
      <p>He first visited Iowa in 1985, when he was leading a government agricultural research delegation. At the time he met with first-time governor Terry Branstad, who is now Trump’s envoy to Beijing.</p>
      <p>When he was vice president in 2012, Xi returned to the eastern Iowa town of Muscatine to meet his host family from the 1985 trip.</p>
      <p>While the U.S.-China trade war has slashed exports of U.S. soybeans and other crops, Trump has sought to offset the harm to farmers through $28 billion in trade aid support over the past two years, and his support among farmers remains strong.</p>
      <p>Trump’s approval rating was 71% as of Aug. 23, down from 79% in July, according to trade publication Farm Journal Pulse’s poll of 1,153 farmers.</p>
