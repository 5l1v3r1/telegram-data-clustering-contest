      <p>The notice was published on the website of China Tobacco, a Chinese government agency and state-owned producer of tobacco products operated by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology that is responsible for tobacco regulation.</p>
      <blockquote>In the <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-business-shut-down-ecigarette-online-shops-12055166">notice</a>, the regulator "urges e-cigarette producers, retailers, or individual sellers to temporarily close online sales websites or channels" and “urges e-commerce platforms to temporarily close <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910171077067219-vaping-rep-says-safety-concerns-over-e-cigarettes-are-massively-overblown/">e-cigarette</a> shops" to “further strengthen the protection of the physical and mental health of minors.” China has the world’s biggest population of smokers at more than 300 million. </blockquote>
      <p>Chinese startups have in recent years released e-cigarette products similar to those made by Juul, an American company headquartered in San Francisco, California. There is currently no standard regulation of such products in China. Local Chinese e-cigarette companies, namely Relx and Snow+, confirmed in recent statements to Reuters that they would shut down their online sales of e-cigarette products in accordance with the government’s request.</p>
      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910161077057879-juul-faces-lawsuit-from-mother-of-teen-who-died-due-to-vaping-illness/">E-cigarette</a> use has also become a contentious issue in the US.</p>
      <blockquote>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported 34 deaths and 1,604 cases of lung injuries related to the use of e-cigarettes nationwide as of October 22. However, the exact causes of such respiratory illnesses are still under investigation. </blockquote>
      <p>Several US states, including Michigan, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Oregon and Montana, have already banned flavored e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>In a Wednesday letter to US Health Secretary Alex Azar, a group of 27 Democratic lawmakers urged the Trump administration to expedite the banning of flavored e-cigarette products across the nation.</p>
      <p>"Because of the ever-increasing epidemic of youth e-cigarette use that has been fueled by flavors that include mint and menthol, we implore the Administration to finalize a compliance policy removing all unauthorized, non-tobacco flavored <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910181077078478-juul-stops-selling-vaping-flavored-products-nationwide-amid-ongoing-fda-review/">e-cigarettes</a> from the market immediately,” the statement reads.</p>
