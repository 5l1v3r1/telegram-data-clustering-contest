      <h1>Rudy Boesch, early fan favorite on ‘Survivor,’ dies at 91</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rudy-boesch/">Rudy Boesch</a>, a retired tough-as-nails Navy SEAL and fan favorite on the inaugural season of “Survivor,” has died after a long battle with Alzheimer’s disease. He was 91.</p>
      <p>Director of operations for the Seal Veterans Foundation, Steve Gonzalez, said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rudy-boesch/">Boesch</a> died peacefully Friday night in hospice care in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He was surrounded by loved ones.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rudy-boesch/">Boesch</a> joined the Navy in 1944 and retired in 1990. He completed two tours in Vietnam and earned a Bronze Star.</p>
      <p>He was 72 when he took third place on CBS’ “Survivor.” He proved to be so popular as a no-nonsense but loveable character that he was invited back for the eighth season, “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/survivor/">Survivor</a>: All Stars.”</p>
      <p>Gonzalez called <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rudy-boesch/">Boesch</a> a “legend in the SEAL Teams.”</p>
