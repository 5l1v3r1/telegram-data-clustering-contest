      <h1>Barty, Svitolina advance at WTA Finals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T00:00:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">SANDRA HARWITT</a></address>
      <p>SHENZHEN, China (AP) - Top-ranked Ashleigh Barty advanced Saturday to the final of the WTA Finals where she faces defending champion <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elina-svitolina/">Elina Svitolina</a>, a player she has never beaten in five previous attempts.</p>
      <p>Barty, like <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elina-svitolina/">Svitolina</a>, dropped the opening set of her semifinal before beating second-ranked Karolina Pliskova of Czech Republic 4-6, 6-2, 6-3.</p>
      <p>“I felt like the whole match was an incredibly high level,” Barty said. “I’m just pleased to get another chance to play out here.</p>
      <p>“It’s a match I can come out and try to enjoy. I have nothing to lose. It’s an opportunity against a really tough player.”</p>
      <p>Belinda Bencic retired in the third set as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elina-svitolina/">Svitolina</a> outlasted the injured Swiss to win 5-7, 6-3, 4-1 and reach her second straight final at the WTA Finals.</p>

      <p>“It’s still kind of like not realizing that I’m in the final,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elina-svitolina/">Svitolina</a> said, but added “it’s tough to play someone who has been injured.”</p>
      <p>This has been a standout season for Barty, who won her first Grand Slam title at the French Open, and attained top ranking for the first time. Barty is Australia’s first female year-end No. 1.</p>
      <p>Barty posted 11 aces to only one for Pliskova.</p>
      <p>This marked the third consecutive year that Pliskova had advanced to the semifinals, but she’s yet to contest for the title in a final.</p>

        <p>Bencic was already struggling before the end of the first set, which she won. Bencic later said it was a hamstring problem and cramping.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elina-svitolina/">Svitolina</a> had made it through the group stage without dropping a set. Winning the WTA Finals in Singapore last season remains the biggest title of her career.</p>
        <p>After holding serve to lead 6-5 in the first set against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elina-svitolina/">Svitolina</a>, Bencic received a medical timeout to have treatment during the changeover. Back on court, Bencic took the set on her third set point with a backhand down-the-line winner.</p>
        <p>But the leg injury caused more problems for Bencic, allowing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elina-svitolina/">Svitolina</a> to gain control of the match.</p>
        <p>Bencic, who lost her serve in the first and ninth games of the second set, received further treatment when trailing 1-2 and 3-4 at the changeovers.</p>
        <p>In the third set, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elina-svitolina/">Svitolina</a> went ahead 3-0, and by 4-1 Bencic couldn’t continue.</p>
        <p>Some players have remarked on the slowness of the court during the week. Bencic claimed the court hindered movement, although <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elina-svitolina/">Svitolina</a> appears to enjoy the surface.</p>
        <p>“I really didn’t want to retire,” Bencic said. “I wanted to finish the match. It was not possible. I’m really disappointed about how my body failed me.</p>
        <p>“Also, I think these courts are really not ideal.”</p>
        <p>Naomi Osaka, the reigning Australian Open champion, withdrew ahead of her second round-robin match with a right shoulder injury.</p>
        <p>Reigning U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu withdrew before her third round-robin match after injuring her knee in the previous match.</p>
