      <p>The boy had been in his bed when he was allegedly stabbed in the neck on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>Daniel Jensen, 33, has been charged with several offences including attempted murder. None of the charges have been proven in court. Police said he had a previous relationship with the boy's mother.</p>
      <p>Police said those charges could change. Winnipeg police const. Jay Murray had said that “certainly if an individual passes away as a result of an assault we can upgrade charges.”</p>
      <p>On Friday morning, the family told <a href="https://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/vigil-held-outside-hospital-for-stabbing-victim-3-to-be-taken-off-life-support-1.4667029">CTV News Winnipeg</a> an MRI scan revealed that Hunter, who was at the city’s Health Sciences Centre, had suffered severe brain damage.</p>
      <p>Darryl Contois, a friend of the family, said Hunter was his mother’s only child, adding that his mother had “been through hell and back.”</p>
      <p>That same day, a vigil was held at the hospital during the afternoon. There, Hunter’s family grieved alongside members of the community who also offered personal condolences and prayers.</p>
      <p>During the vigil, Hunter was described as an inquisitive child with big dreams. Contois described how, “out of the blue, (Hunter) would ask you anything. But he always had a smile and he loved toy guns.”</p>
