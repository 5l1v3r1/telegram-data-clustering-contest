      </p>
      <p>Almost fifty fights deep into his MMA career, Jorge Masvidal is finally getting the recognition he deserves over sixteen years after making his MMA debut. Why? It’s no secret that Masvidal has always been a legit contender at welterweight, but close split decision losses held him back earlier in his UFC career. Now riding consecutive first round knockouts over Ben Askren and Darren Till, Masvidal has secured the first big payday of his career as he takes on Diaz at UFC 244, and “Gamebred” is adamant he will prove he is the real ‘BMF’ on the night.</p>

      <p>It took Nate Diaz three years to make his UFC comeback, but the Stockton native couldn’t have planned it any better. Outclassing Anthony Pettis in the co-main event of UFC 241 in August, Diaz always had Masvidal in mind for his next fight as he called out the fellow UFC veteran in his post-fight interview. After that it was on the UFC to put the fight together, and not only did they do that, they also made a brand new title, the ‘BMF’ title, just for this fight.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why should you care?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Regardless of your thoughts on the ‘BMF’ title. this fight is guaranteed to excite.</p>
