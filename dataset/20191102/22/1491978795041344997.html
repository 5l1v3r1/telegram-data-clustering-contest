      <p>A 310-year-old antique violin worth £250,000 that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/30/antique-violin-tecchler-left-train-london-stolen-police-say">was stolen from a train</a> in London has been returned to its owner with no damage.</p>
      <p>Professional musician Stephen Morris, who said it was “devastating” to lose the instrument made by craftsman David Tecchler in 1709, reported the violin missing on 22 October.</p>
      <p>He said he left the violin on the London Victoria to Orpington train when he got off at Penge East.</p>
      <p>Tweeting the news that the violin had been returned, Morris wrote: “My violin is home safe and sound! Thanks for the overwhelming support.”</p>
      <p>Overseen by plain-clothes police officers, the instrument was handed to Morris at a car park in Beckenham on Friday evening after a suspect was identified.</p>
      <p>The BBC reported that the man who had the violin apologised and said he had made a mistake. Morris told the BBC: “I feel a bit battered and bruised... I haven’t had a great deal of sleep since it went missing. He was very apologetic, he said he wanted to hand it to me in person.”</p>
      <p>British Transport Police had previously said a man had taken the violin as the train approached Bromley South, and got on a connecting train to St Mary Cray.</p>
      <p>Police released a CCTV image of a man they believed to be connected to the incident; a person then sent a direct message to Morris on Twitter who identified him.</p>
      <p>BTP said it would be taking no further action against the man, as he had contacted Morris and handed the violin back. “It couldn’t have ended in a happier way,” the musician said.</p>
