      <p>The Bray woman has taken her place in Irish Sporting history with a points victory in Manchester over Christina Linardatou for the WBO super lightweight title.</p>
      <p>Taylor know follows in Steve Collins’s and Carl Frampton’s footsteps and become only the third Irish boxer to be a two-weight world champion.</p>
      <p>Competing at the ten-stone limit for the first time the fight went the distance but Taylor emerged the unanimous victor on the judge scorecards 97-93 and 96-94.</p>

      <p>This is only Christina Linardatou's second defeat as a professional boxer.</p>
      <p>Showing obvious emotion after the fight Katie Taylor paid tribute to her opponent and thanked all those who had helped her make history.</p>

      <p>The victory further opens up options for Taylor, rematches with now fellow 140lb queen Jess McCaskill and recently deposed lightweight stakeholder Persoon among them.</p>
      <p>An oft-mooted match-up with Amanda Serrano also seems likely for 2020, while promoter Eddie Hearn could well attempt to wangle a catchweight clash between Taylor and new recruit Cecilia Braekhus.</p>
