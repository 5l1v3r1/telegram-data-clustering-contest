      <h1>X Factor's Try Star lads address England's rugby World Cup final loss</h1>
      <h2>The boys took to the stage with an emotional rendition of Swing Low Sweet Chariot and heaped praise on England's rugby team</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T22:15:22+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 22:15</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p>After the country was left down in the dumps by England rugby's thrashing at South African hands, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor's</a> Try Star is looking on the bright side.</p>
      <p>Taking to the stage during tonight's live show, the hunky rugby lads performed a rendition of England's famed fan tune Swing Low Sweet Chariot that tugged on the heartstrings.</p>
      <p>The audience went wild for the tear-jerking belter, with Dermot O'Leary joining them on stage as the crowds roared.</p>
      <p>Ben Foden, former England pro, addressed the disappointed rugby fans: "There's no more disappointed people in the world than those 30 guys over in Japan, but we couldn't be prouder, as rugby players with close relationships with those guys.</p>
      <p>"They've done a fantastic job of representing England in a fantastic World Cup."</p>

      <p>Ben's touching words drew renewed cries of adoration from the audience, as all three boys - Ben, Thom Evans and Levi Davis - wore sincerely proud expressions on their faces.</p>
      <p>Dermot went to the judges for their feedback, Nicole Scherzinger gushing: "Guys, I'm super impressed how you completely changed gears this week.</p>
      <p>"The origins of this song are completely rooted in black history and that song is like a soulful prayer. Levi, you gave a beautiful, heart-felt performance."</p>

      <p>"I loved it. Who wouldn't love that song?" Louis Walsh asked. "I loved the way you're disappointed about the rugby but you brought everything onto stage tonight.</p>
      <p>"Levi, you are a star. But Thom and Ben...you know, it just works."</p>
      <p>Simon Cowell was equally as impressed.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He told the boys: "I think what you did  took my back to when we first met you the first time.</p>
      <p>"Are you the best singers in this competition? Not necessarily, but you are decent, nice, respectful, fun, great guys. I can't give you a golden buzzer. I wish to God I could."</p>

      <p>Turning to the other two judges, Simon asked: "Couldn't one of you two do it?"</p>
      <p>"I've used mine," said Louis as eyes turned on Nicole.</p>
      <p>Dermot turned the mic back to Try Star, Thom adding: "I think it would have been wrong not to acknowledge, as Ben said, England doing so well and reaching the final of the World Cup."</p>
      <p>Levi, who looked close to tears, said: "Yeah, it was amazing. We came out here and gave it our all, like we do every week."</p>
      <p>Nicole got Louis and Simon up on their feet applauding when she interrupted to announce she'd be using her golden buzzer for the trio.</p>
      <p>"I'm gonna do this," she announced, "For the boys, and this country. My love and respect for this country."</p>
