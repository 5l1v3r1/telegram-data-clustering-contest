      <p>The brother of a schoolgirl who was sexually assaulted and murdered almost 25 years ago has recalled the last time he saw her alive.</p>
      <p>Naomi Smith was just 15 when she was brutally killed at a park just 100 yards from the family home in Nuneaton, Warwickshire.</p>
      <p>Edwin Hopkins, then 19, slit her throat, mutilated her from the waist down and bit her breast after she had stepped out to post a letter for her mother, Catherine, on the evening of September 14, 1995.</p>
      <p>After she failed to return home, her father, Brian Smith, went looking for her and found her body under the children's slide at a playground.</p>

      <p>Naomi's brother, David Freeman, last saw her alive just two days earlier when she asked him for a fiver to buy fish and chips on her way home from swimming.</p>
      <p>He was 25 at the time.</p>
      <p>When Naomi was murdered he was in Birmingham and got a call from his mum, who told him to come home immediately because "something's happened to Naomi".</p>
      <p>The street was filled with police cars when he arrived home and officers gave him the devastating news that his sister was dead.</p>

      <p>Mr Freeman told the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10254068/naomi-smith-murder-nuneaton-murdertown/">Sun Online</a> that he was "numb" and found it hard to believe.</p>
      <p>He said: “My mum was in the house in absolute tatters.</p>
      <p>“In the park, Brian was in absolute bits, sat on the floor near where Naomi was found, beside himself with shock and grief.</p>
      <p>He added: “When it came out about what he (Jones) actually did to her body it was absolutely mind-blowing. Calling him an animal is too good – even an animal wouldn’t do that.”</p>

      <p>Mr Freeman said the murder destroyed Mrs Smith, who died of cancer in 2009.</p>
      <p>Unemployed Hopkins, who lived with his parents nearby and was fascinated with knives, was charged with murder two months later after police launched the first ever mass DNA screening.</p>
      <p>As officers spoke to people living in the area, Hopkins had given a statement claiming he was at his sister's house at the time of the murder.</p>
      <p>But his DNA sample matched DNA that was recovered from Naomi's body.</p>
      <p>His teeth matched a bite mark on Naomi's body.</p>

      <p>In January 1997, a jury found Hopkins guilty of murder after less than four hours of deliberation.</p>
      <p>Aged 20, he was jailed the following month for life with a minimum term of 18 years before he would be considered for parole.</p>
      <p>The sex killer has has never admitted his guilt and has been imprisoned as a Category A inmate - the highest security risk.</p>
      <p>In August, a High Court judge ruled that Hopkins, 43, can have a full hearing relating to his bid to be moved to an open prison, an essential step towards release.</p>
      <p>Mr Freeman and other relatives have said Hopkins should never be released from prison.</p>
      <p>The murder is being retold in an episode of Murdertown on C&amp;I that is due to air on Monday.</p>
