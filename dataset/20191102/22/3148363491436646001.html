      <p>Acting Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli implementation of the “public charge” rule has some Democrats crying foul, including Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), who in recent days has gone as far as saying such policy advances a “white supremacist ideology.”</p>
      <p>Under the rule, immigrants who are receiving some type of benefit from the government for a certain period would be labeled a “public charge” and could be denied a green card by immigration officials.</p>
      <p>During an appearance on MSNBC’s “The Last Word” on Friday,” Wasserman Schultz explained to guest host Ali Velshi why she viewed that as “white supremacist ideology,” a claim she pushed in a hearing with Cuccinelli earlier in the week.<br/>“The question I was asking was about the public charge rule that Ken Cuccinelli advanced, which would deny immigration to an individual who may become what he called a public charge if they needed benefits when they come to the United States,” she said. “And that was – that is intimidating thousands of families and having them withdraw their children from vital public programs that keep them healthy and safe.”</p>
      <p>“And he couldn’t even answer the simple question I was asking, was – how many children did that public charge rule affect?” Wasserman Schultz continued. “He had no idea because he didn’t care. And that further underscored what I was saying, which is that they have been persecuting people of color, their immigration policy advances a white supremacist ideology, and I just called it out because I had that opportunity.”</p>
