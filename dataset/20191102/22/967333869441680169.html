        <b>TEHRAN (Sputnik) - Iran and Syria struck an agreement on long-term cooperation in electricity market on Saturday, with Tehran hoping to export electricity to the Arab Republic in the future, the Iranian Energy Ministry said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The memorandum of understanding was signed by <a href="http://sputniknews.com/middleeast/20170912/1057330347.html">Syrian Electricity Minister Zuhair Kharboutli</a> and Iranian Energy Minister Reza Ardakanian.</p>
      <blockquote>"We plan and intend, after creating the necessary infrastructure to implement this program, to sync power grids of Iran and Syria within three years", Ardakanian said.</blockquote>
      <p>He noted that, in the future, there would be a possibility of electricity transfer between Iran and Syria through Iraq. The minister recalled that Iran and Iraq had already synced their power grids.</p>
      <p>In a separate statement, the ministry announced that the three countries would create a special consortium. The two energy chiefs also agreed that Iranian companies would take part in building thermal power plants in Syria, restoring them and increasing their capacity.</p>
      <p>Earlier in September, it was reported that about 180 Iranian firms are to be <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201809171068100303-iran-syria-restoration-construction/">engaged in Syria's rebuilding</a> after years of devastating civil war. This was followed by <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201810031068557139-syria-iran-reconstruction/">lucrative agreements</a> between the two countries later in October aimed at restoring energy to Syrian regions that were damaged by war.</p>
      <p>Back in fall 2018, Iran's MAPNA Group signed an agreement with Syria to construct a power plant in the city of Latakia with a capacity of 540 megawatts.</p>
