      <p>A driver led police on a high-speed 137mph chase down a motorway before his car was shunted off the road by police.</p>
      <p>David Brennan then tried to fool officers into believing he wasn't behind the wheel of a stolen Mini Cooper  - but his actions were caught on camera.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old led was pursued along one of Britain's busiest stretches of motorway after officers spotted the vehicle at 3.20pm on September 18.</p>
      <p>Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG) officers had been told to keep an eye out for the Mini which had been stolen in burglary in Halesowen, West Midlands, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/video-shows-maniac-driver-137mph-20796189">Daily Record reported</a> .</p>

      <p>Brennan notched up speeds of up to 100mph as he raced past officers on the M54 near Wolverhampton.</p>
      <p>As he reached Junction 10 of the M6 for Walsall, Brennan tried to head the wrong way up a slip road and officers decided to use tactical contact to bring him to a halt.</p>
      <p>The banned motorist then jumped out of the driver's seat and into the back of the car and can be heard on camera telling cops: "I wasn't even driving."</p>
      <p>An officer replies: "Yes you was mate. Its all on camera as well pal, so lets not be daft."</p>

      <p>Unemployed Brennan, of Bartley Green, Birmingham, went on to admit dangerous driving and driving while disqualified and was jailed for 18 months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He was also given a further three-year driving ban.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Mitch Darby, of West Midlands Police, who pursued Brennan, said after the case: "This was appalling driving  on one of the busiest sections of motorway in the country, which put other drivers at risk.</p>

      <p>"We had no option but to use our training to safely bring the pursuit to an end, before the Mini had a chance to go on to potentially be involved in a head-on collision on the slip road.</p>
      <p>"Brennan thought he could pull the wool over our eyes with a quick jump over the seats and into the back of the car, but we'd seen it happen and it was all caught on video."</p>
