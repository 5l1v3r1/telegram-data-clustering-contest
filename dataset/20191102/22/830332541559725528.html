      <h1>Dunkin's peppermint mocha launches holiday season</h1>
      <h2>Starbucks sticking with pumpkin spice a bit longer</h2>

      <p>(CNN) - It's not even Thanksgiving, and Dunkin' is already bringing the pumpkin spice season to a close.</p>
      <p>The coffee and doughnut chain announced Friday on Twitter that their peppermint mocha will be returning for the season on November 6, after nixing the limited-time drink last year.</p>
      <p>The drink signals the arrival of the chain's winter holiday line up.</p>
      <p>Starbucks, though, seems to be hanging on to pumpkin spice season a little longer.</p>
      <p>The company has not made any official announcements regarding their winter flavors -- including their own seasonal peppermint mocha. But they did post a tweet on Saturday hinting at an impending announcement.</p>
      <p>Last year, Starbucks brought the drinks back on November 2.</p>
      <p>For customers not quite ready to part with pumpkin spice, no worries. Both Dunkin' and Starbucks still tend to carry their pumpkin flavors until supplies run out.</p>
