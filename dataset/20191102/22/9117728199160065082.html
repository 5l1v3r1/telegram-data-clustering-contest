      <p>Hamilton, who needs just four points to win his sixth Formula 1 world championship, didn't blame the Mercedes car for his performance at COTA on Saturday. </p>
      <p><i>"It's nothing to do with the car I just didn't put the laps together today and the car had the capability to be on the front row and it was my fault. Honestly, I'm not trying to think about [winning sixth world championship] right now, I'm just trying to digest what happened and think about tomorrow,"</i> Hamilton told the media after the qualifying session. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a>, who is the only other driver in with a shot of winning the 2019 F1 championship, starts from pole position. </p>
