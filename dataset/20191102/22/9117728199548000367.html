        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/charles-leclerc">Charles Leclerc</a> insists his P4 in qualifying for the United States Grand Prix isn't a bad result once his lack of running in the final practice session is considered. The man from Monaco says it's interesting to start next to <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> as he eyes up chances for the race. </b>
      </p>
      <p><i>“It's never nice to miss out on time in FP3 because it's the only session that really prepares you for the qualifying. I don't know to what extent it influences it but for us, anything is possible tomorrow. The start remains interesting here, but we will see how it goes,"</i> said Leclerc to the Ziggo Sport camera.</p>

      <p><i>“I'm pretty happy about today. We were not far from pole. After what happened today, we can be quite satisfied, because it was not easy,"</i> he continued.</p>
      <p>Dutch reporter Jack Plooij cannot resist calling in Verstappen. The Dutchman starts from P3 in Austin, so next to Leclerc: <i>"Yes, indeed next to Max ... It is always interesting to start next to each other,"</i> is the reaction of the Ferrari driver.</p>

      <p><i>"You can fight in the first rounds, so the elbows can be used,"</i> Plooij emphasizes, "Yes," Leclerc finally replied laughing.</p>
