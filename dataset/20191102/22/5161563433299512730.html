      <p>VANCOUVER - Notable B.C. resident Pamela Anderson is drawing heavy criticism online after posting photos of herself posing in a feathered headdress.</p>
      <p>Anderson <a href="https://twitter.com/pamfoundation/status/1190040368148090891">tweeted the photos</a> Thursday afternoon with the caption "Happy Halloween." Since then, more than 500 tweets have been sent in response, many of them criticizing her for appropriating Indigenous culture.</p>
      <p>"This is really disappointing and racist Pam, I thought you were better than this," wrote one user, who went on to describe warbonnets as sacred and earned.</p>
      <p>"Culture isn't a costume, it's not disposable, it's not an aesthetic," the user wrote.</p>
