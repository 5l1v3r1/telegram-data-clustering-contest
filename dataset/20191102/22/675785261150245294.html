      <p>Kirsty Gallacher has blamed her painful divorce for her drink driving arrest and subsequent two-year ban.</p>
      <p>The TV presenter, 43, split from former rugby star Paul Sampson in 2014, and in 2017 she was convicted after being found three times over the limit.</p>
      <p>She now admits she was "in a very bad place" at the time as she struggled to deal with the breakup and how it affected her children.</p>
      <p>Kirsty told The Mail on Sunday’s You magazine: "I was in a very bad place with the divorce and issues to do with the children’s schedule. I was exhausted…</p>
      <p>"I wasn't thinking straight. It was very bad and very un-Kirsty because I've always been a good girl.</p>

      <p>"We all make mistakes, life's not perfect. And in the limelight you're apparently not able to put a foot wrong."</p>
      <p>She was also struggling to cope her father Bernard's near-death experience, with the former golfer being brought back to life three times after suffering a cardiac arrest.</p>
      <p>Kirsty continued: "It was traumatic. Divorce is horrible. It floored me like it floors everyone…</p>

      <p>"I was just so anxious about the kids – my pain was connected with their pain, and I didn't look after myself."</p>
      <p>Kirsty was arrested after she was spotted 'driving erratically'.</p>
      <p>Police conducted a roadside breathalyser test which showed her alcohol level was at 106 microgrammes in 100 millilitres of breath.</p>

      <p>The drink-drive limit in England and Wales is 35 microgrammes per 100 millilitres of breath.</p>
      <p>She pleaded guilty at Slough Magistrates' Court to one count of driving a motor vehicle while her alcohol level was above the legal limit.</p>
      <p>Kirsty was banned from driving for two years, ordered to carry out 100 hours of community service and told to pay a £85 fine.</p>
