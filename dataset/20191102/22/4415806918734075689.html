      <h1>Munster score four tries to see off Cardiff Blues in Guinness PRO14</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T22:27:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 22:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Munster moved to the top of Guinness PRO14 Conference B with a convincing 33-23 victory over Cardiff Blues at the Arms Park.</p>
      <p>The visitors outscored their opponents by four tries to two to send Blues to their fourth league defeat in a row.</p>
      <p>That record leaves Cardiff 11 points behind Scarlets in the third play-off place, leaving them with much to do if they are to retrieve their season.</p>
      <p>Alby Mathewson scored two tries for Munster, with Chris Cloete and Calvin Nash adding the others and J. J. Hanrahan kicking three penalties and two conversions.</p>
      <p>Corey Domachowski and Nick Williams touched down for Blues’ tries while Jarrod Evans chipped in with three penalties and a conversion. Jason Tovey also added a conversion.</p>
      <p>Cardiff took a seventh-minute lead when Evans fired over a penalty after the visitors had infringed at a scrum.</p>
      <p>With the wind in their faces, Munster were forced to run the ball at almost every opportunity and a powerful burst from Calvin Nash took them into the home 22, where Hanrahan tied up the scores with a penalty.</p>
      <p>They were not level for long, though, as straight from the restart the Irish were penalised, allowing Evans to put the hosts back in front.</p>
      <p>However, Munster continued to trouble the Blues defence, with Darren O’Shea and Arno Botha combining skilfully to punch a hole in it before Matthew Morgan managed to drag down the latter to prevent a certain try.</p>

      <p>It mattered little as minutes later O’Shea and Jeremy Loughman made holes in a porous defence for Cloete to force his way over.</p>
      <p>Hanrahan converted and added a penalty as his side continued to dominate with their expert ball retention in the difficult conditions, but Cardiff struck back when Domachowski rewarded a sustained period of pressure by forcing his way over to make it 13-13 at the interval.</p>
      <p>After the restart, Blues continued their rally and were rewarded with a third penalty from Evans, but the visitors again demonstrated their superb handling skills when Kevin O’Byrne and Botha set up a try for Mathewson.</p>

      <p>Mathewson then turned provider with a neat pass sending Nash over and Blues looked in trouble trailing 25-16 going into the final quarter.</p>
      <p>Munster saved the best for last when a superb run from replacement Rory Scannell saw him supported by Mathewson and Dan Goggin before Mathewson was on hand to collect the scoring pass.</p>
      <p>Hanrahan missed the conversion but succeeded with a late penalty before a try from Nick Williams gave Blues some respectability.</p>
