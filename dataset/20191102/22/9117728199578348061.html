        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a> recorded a strong lap in the first round of Q3 which was good enough for the Finnish driver to qualify on pole for the United States Grand Prix. Sebastian Vettel was just 0.012 behind the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> driver in what was a tight session. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Drivers couldn't improve enough on the 2nd lap of Q3 as the conditions didn't improve. Bottas managed to do the all-important qualifying lap in the first round and Bottas pointed this out in his interview on-track. </p>
      <p><i>"It was a nice lap in the beginning of Q3, you rarely get those. Yesterday was a bit tricky. I knew how to put it together and it was a nice feeling to actually do it in Q3,"</i> Bottas said. </p>
      <p>Bottas' teammate, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> didn't manage to get that first lap in and as a result will start from 5th. </p>
