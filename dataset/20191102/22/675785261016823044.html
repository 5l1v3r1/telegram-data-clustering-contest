      <p>An Instagram model has claimed she has earned £60,000 in just eight months by flogging revealing lingerie snaps online.</p>
      <p>Chloe Horton, 19, from Clydebank, Scotland, said she pockets £20 every time somebody subscribes to her OnlyFans page and takes home a  £7,500 'wage' every month.</p>
      <p>Not content with her bumper earnings, the busty brunette has 'upgraded' to rival site Admire Me VIP, which she thinks will allow her to earn up to £15,000-a-month</p>
      <p>Chloe tweeted: "Mental to think I've made 60 grand from only fans since February."</p>
      <p>Chloe insists she has never posted full nude pictures on her page which has been branded a porn site for wannabe glamour models.</p>

      <p>OnlyFans subscribers pay cash to view lingerie-clad women on camera.</p>
      <p>Users are able to splash out more to see saucier naked snaps.</p>
      <p>There is also an option to pay £35 to view images deemed too explicit for other social media outlets.</p>
