      <h2>Jesse Lingard came off the bench in Manchester United's defeat by Bournemouth on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T22:07:05+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 22:07</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer handed Jesse Lingard a note during Manchester United's defeat by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> - and fans are joking about what was written on it.</p>
      <p>Lingard came off the bench for the Red Devils as they went for broke in the second half against the Cherries at the Vitality Stadium, but to no avail.</p>
      <p>It is not known what was written on the note passed onto the winger but United supporters have made some humorous suggestions on social media.</p>
      <p>"I don't really know what I am doing," one supporter joked was written on the note, while another suggested it was a shopping list.</p>

      <p>Josh King netted the only goal of the game as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> were beaten for a fourth time in the Premier League this season.</p>
      <p>After the match, Solskjaer said: "Mason Greenwood was unlucky when he hit the post, I saw him scoring those chances more than missing them, but he will come good.</p>
      <p>"I thought Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial defended very well against them, but in games like this one it is so important get the first goal and they did it."</p>
      <p>Harry Maguire added on MUTV: "[We are] disappointed. We conceded at an awful time at a stage where we started the game really well.</p>

      <p>"The first 20 minutes we were well on top, we have got to score in that period, with numerous chances.</p>
      <p>"The quality in the final third wasn't good enough to create a real clear cut chance, then they came into the game at the end of the first-half and it is an awful time to concede just before half-time, it is probably the worst."</p>
