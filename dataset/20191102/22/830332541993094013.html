      <h1>Delta brings back same-sex scenes in ‘Booksmart,' ‘Rocketman' to flights</h1>
      <h2>Airline didn't ask for edits, spokesman says</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T22:25:57+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 22:25</time> by <a rel="author">Nicole Chavez and Melissa Alonso, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Delta Air Lines says in-flight versions of the films <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/05/29/entertainment/booksmart-celebs-support/index.html">"Booksmart"</a> and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/05/29/entertainment/rocketman-review/index.html">Elton John's biopic "Rocketman"</a> will no longer skip same-sex love scenes.</p>
      <p>The scenes on both films were "unnecessarily excluded," the airline said.</p>
      <p>"We are immediately putting a new process in place for managing content available through Delta's in-flight entertainment," Delta said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The airline's decision comes days after <a href="https://twitter.com/oliviawilde/status/1189604886142509058">"Booksmart" director Olivia Wilde tweeted</a> she had watched an edited version of her film on a flight and said the words "vagina" and "genitals" and scenes involving lesbian kissing were cut.</p>
      <p>Wilde did not mention what airline she was using in her tweets.</p>
      <p>"Turns out some airlines work with a third party company that edits the movie based on what they deem inappropriate," the actress <a href="https://twitter.com/oliviawilde/status/1189604886142509058">tweeted.</a> "Which, in our case, is ... female sexuality?"</p>
      <p>Delta staffers typically pick between original and edited versions of the films offered by the studios or third-party vendors.</p>
      <p>"Currently, we have Gentleman Jack, Imagine Me and You, and Moonlight onboard and countless content in the past that clearly shows it is not our practice to omit LGBTQ+ love scenes," the airline said.</p>
      <p>Delta chose to use the edited versions of "Booksmart" and "Rocketman," but the staffers didn't realize they would be omitting content "well within" the airline's guidelines," Delta said.</p>
      <p>The airline didn't edit or asked for any edits to the films, said Delta spokesman Adrian Gee.</p>
      <p>Gee said new versions of the films will be shown in future flights, but the exact date was not available yet.</p>
