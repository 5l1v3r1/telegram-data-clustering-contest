      <h1>X Factor fans rage as Martin Bashir is saved again and brand show a 'f***ing joke'</h1>
      <h2>Victoria Ekanoye and ex-EastEnders star Jonny Labey were sent home from The X Factor tonight, leaving fans seething with rage</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T22:27:37+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 22:27</time> by <a rel="author">Rose Hill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rose-hill/</a></address>
      <p>X Factor fans were left utterly furious as Martin Bashir was saved a second time by Simon Cowell - despite forgetting his lyrics to his song last night.</p>
      <p>The journalist, 56, landed in the bottom three of the public vote with former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> star Victoria Ekanoye and ex-EastEnders actor Jonny Labey.</p>
      <p>Victoria was immediately eliminated after receiving the fewest votes, meaning that it was up to judges Simon, Nicole Scherzinger and Louis Walsh to decide Martin and Jonny's fate.</p>
      <p>Nicole and Louis decided to save their respective acts, however Simon refused to choose and left it to the public vote.</p>

      <p>Host Dermot O'Leary revealed that Jonny would be leaving the competition, despite winning a safe seat last week.</p>

      <p>However viewers flocked to Twitter in anger, branding the show a "f***ing joke".</p>

      <p>However viewers were furious and flocked to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> in anger.</p>
      <p>One calmly tweeted: "WHY DO I BOTHER WATCHING THIS SHOW EVERY YEAR FOR THIS S*** #XFactorCelebrity."</p>
      <p>While another commented: "WHAT THE F***! WHY ARE THEY SO OBSESSED WITH KEEPING MARTIN?!? #XFactorCelebrity #XFactor."</p>

      <p>A third remarked: "Simon what are you playing at?! This is officially a farce, a f***ing joke. Even Martin knows he's shit and wondering how he keeps getting second chances. First Olivia now Jonny, what the actual fuck is going on #XFactor #XFactorCelebrity."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Seriously though first Olivia now Jonny... this is why nobody takes <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> seriously lol #XFactorCelebrity."</p>
      <p>One commented: "What the actual how did Martin get more votes than Jonny and Victoria #XFactorCelebrity."</p>

      <p>"X FACTOR has just become the biggest joke. Yet again wrong act sent home. Simon I think you need to see a doctor #XFactorCelebrity," another fumed.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the programme, Martin was close to tears in the middle of his performance to Lionel Richie's Easy.</p>
      <p>Less than halfway through the song, he shocked everyone by announcing: "I've forgotten my words."</p>
      <p>He tried to carry on but later added: "I do apologise."</p>
      <p>Backstage, fellow star Victoria held her hands to her chest while Jenny looked on in horror.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, Simon Cowell asked what had happened and Martin claimed that a last minute song change was to blame for his lapse in memory.</p>
      <p>"I'm not trying to make excuses but my song had to change," he said. "I've been anxious all evening and it went out of my mind."</p>
