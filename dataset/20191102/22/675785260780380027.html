      <h1>Jeremy Corbyn pledges to make 27 million homes greener to cut winter deaths</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE Residents would be offered state of the art energy savers to upgrade their homes, creating 450,000 jobs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T22:06:28+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 22:06</time> by <a rel="author">Nigel Nelson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nigel-nelson/</a></address>
      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is planning the biggest programme of home improvement since the post-war housing boom.</p>
      <p>It would see all 27 million homes in the land offered upgrading with state-of-the-art energy savers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> ’s Warm Homes For All scheme to be unveiled on Sunday  will create 450,000 construction jobs to fit the loft insulation, solar power and double glazing needed.</p>
      <p>The plan is to prevent 1,500 winter deaths and 565,000 cases of asthma as homes are made healthier by 2030.</p>

      <p>And installing low carbon high-tec will cut emissions by 10 per cent, the equivalent of taking seven in ten cars off the road.</p>
      <p>Low income households will stump no money up front but gradually pay back some of what they owe from the £417 a year projected savings in energy bills.</p>
      <p>Wealthier households will be offered interest free loans to improve their homes.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said: “If we don’t radically change course we face the threat of a hostile and dying planet.</p>
      <p>“We can either take action to protect future generations, or allow the Tories to help fuel our planet’s destruction.”</p>
      <p>Labour estimates a cost of £250 billion to upgrade homes nationwide and the state will contribute £60billion of that.</p>
      <p>The remainder will come from the energy savings generated.</p>
