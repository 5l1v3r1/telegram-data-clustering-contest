      <h1>JJ Watt explains love of Chelsea and the Premier League after suffering season-ending injury</h1>
      <h2>The Houston Texans star will not be in action at Wembley on Sunday - but can now devote more time to his other passion</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T22:30:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Keith Webster, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/keith-webster/</a></address>
      <p>JJ Watt saw his chance to play at Wembley on Sunday and his Super Bowl dream go up in smoke last week, with a season-ending injury against Oakland.</p>
      <p>But at least the Houston Texans star will now be able to devote more time to his other sporting passion – the Premier League, and his ­beloved Chelsea FC.</p>
      <p>Watt turned professional eight years ago, in the same season Chelsea were crowned kings of Europe.</p>
      <p>And the man who is ­respected for his sporting ability and revered for his ­charity work, still remembers how the goal hero that night in 2012, Didier Drogba, turned him on to football, ­Premier League-style.</p>
      <p>The 6ft 5in, 21st defensive end, who is engaged to ­Houston Dash midfielder, Kealia Ohai, said: “Once it started to get prominent on TV in America, I started to watch it. They would show it on Saturdays and it’s the first thing on in the morning.</p>

      <p>“I didn’t know anything about the teams, the ­traditions, the history, the ­rivalries.</p>
      <p>“But I visited Stamford Bridge and got to see Chelsea play – I got to see Drogba’s last game as a Blue.</p>
      <p>“I really started to get into it then, started researching, and I fell in love with it.</p>
      <p>“I mean I truly, absolutely love watching Premier League every single weekend.</p>
      <p>“Two weeks ago sucked ­because it was international break, but it doesn’t matter to me if it’s top of the table or bottom of the table.</p>
      <p>“I’ll watch Newcastle play Sheffield United.</p>

      <p>“I just watched the Leeds United documentary, and that was cool. It was all about the Championship.</p>
      <p>“I watched Sunderland Till I Die. I watch everything.”</p>
      <p>Watt, who will miss today’s Wembley showdown against Jacksonville with a pectoral injury, became a national icon in 2017 when he raised $37million for Houston flood victims of Hurricane Harvey.</p>
      <p>He is rewarded handsomely for his dominant presence on the field, and is in the middle of a six-year $100m contract extension.</p>
      <p>But don’t ask him to choose the NFL over the ­Premier League, when he turns on his TV.</p>

      <p>“It’s Premier League, by far,” he said. “I love watching it. Right now I love watching Teemu Pukki. He’s so much fun and he just scores goals.”</p>
      <p>Watt’s fundraising after the flood disaster helped build more than 1,100 homes and provide 239 million meals to victims, but Watt said he was humbled by the response to his efforts.</p>
      <p>He added: “It was a time I hope we never have to go through again and it was also a time when I witnessed the absolute best in humanity.</p>
      <p>“I witnessed what people are willing to do for their neighbour and for complete strangers.</p>
      <p>“People from all over the world stepped up to help out. It was a time of great hope for me. There’s such negativity in the world and we got to ­witness some incredible ­positivity.”</p>
