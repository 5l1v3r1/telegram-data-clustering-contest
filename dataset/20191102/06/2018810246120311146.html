      <p>Move over battle royales, auto battlers are now the new genre of choice. <i>Hearthstone</i> will be getting its own <i>Auto Chess</i>-style mode, which will go into open beta from November 12 internationally.</p>
      <p>The mode will support up to 8 players, and players will recruit minions on a round-by-round basis. Not many other details had been revealed during the opening keynote, although a follow-up release noted that the mode will feature 24 heroes at launch. More information was due to be revealed later at Blizzcon during the <i>Hearthstone</i> panel, and the game mode is playable on the Blizzcon show floor.</p>
