      <p>(Reuters) - Former Ryder Cup player Boo Weekley is back on a leaderboard, more than a year after having a cancerous tumor removed from a shoulder and losing his status to play full-time on the PGA Tour.</p>
      <p>Fortified by a good day of fishing on the high seas in the tournament lead-up, the self-described ‘redneck’ from the Florida panhandle carded a second straight five-under-par 66 in the second round at the Bermuda Championship at Port Royal on Friday.</p>
      <p>Fellow Americans Harry Higgs (65), Brendon Todd (63) and Scottie Scheffler (69) led at 11-under 131 in a tournament that offers a chance for the tour’s bottom feeders in the absence of the big boys who are either playing the WGC-HSBC Champions or having the week off.</p>
      <p>It is an opportunity welcomed by Weekley, who gets into only a handful of events these days due to his diminished status as a past champion.</p>
      <p>The three-times PGA Tour winner, who played on the victorious 2008 U.S. Ryder Cup team, last triumphed in 2013, but injuries and then the tumor sent his career into the rough.</p>
      <p>He said he was at home this week on a course where he does not have to worry too much about being outhit by more athletic, stronger rivals.</p>
      <p>“You ain’t overpowering the course. You can bunt it around here,” Weekley, who hails from the small Florida town of Milton, said.</p>
      <p>Weekley jokingly batted away a question of whether he was showing his younger rivals a thing or two.</p>
      <p>“I ain’t saying I’m showing them how to play. They might be making a little more mistakes than I am.”</p>
