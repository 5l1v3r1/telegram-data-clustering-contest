        <b>The Goldman Sachs Group has faced allegations from the Malaysian government over providing investors with the wrong information on $6.5 billion bond sales, with the company contributing to collecting billions for the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has said the southeast Asian nation is not going to accept $2 billion from Goldman Sachs as compensation for the 1MDB scandal, the Financial Times reports.</p>
      <blockquote>"Goldman Sachs has offered something like less than $2 billion”, the Prime Minister told the newspaper. "We are not satisfied with that amount so we are still talking to them . . . If they respond reasonably we might not insist on getting that $7.5 billion".</blockquote>

      <p>​It is not the first time Malaysian officials have declined a compensation offer from the US Goldman Sachs company. In June, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201906251076043886-malaysia-govt-slams-goldman-sachs-in-1mdb-case-as-court-hearing-delayed/">the financial group had proposed</a> to give $241.73 million as repayment on the money lost by Malaysia under then-Prime Minister Najib Razak.</p>
      <p>The scandal erupted after Goldman helped Malaysia's state-run fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) collect $6.5 billion in investment in 2012-13, and charged the company $600 million – a price much higher than typical Goldman fees. Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201905111074920793-malaysia-us-1mdb-fund-accusations/">has been accused of money laundering and embezzling</a> about $4.5 billion from the fund.</p>
