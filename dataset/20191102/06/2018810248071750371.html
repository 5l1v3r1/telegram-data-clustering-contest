      <p>Blizzard has finally announced <i>Overwatch 2</i>, the next iteration of the developer’s massively popular first-person hero shooter.</p>
      <p>In the new trailer, revealed today at Blizzcon, <i>Overwatch</i> heroes Mei, Winston and Tracer touch down in Paris, which is overrun by omnics from the extremist group Null Sector. When a behemoth omnic shows up to wreak havoc and all looks lost, the <i>Overwatch</i> team reassembles along with a new friend:</p>

      <p>In June, <i>Kotaku</i> <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/06/sources-blizzard-cancels-starcraft-first-person-shooter-to-focus-on-diablo-4-and-overwatch-2">reported</a> that Blizzard cancelled its <i>Starcraft</i> first-person shooter to redistribute resources to <i>Overwatch 2</i> and <i>Diablo 4</i>. At that time, <i>Kotaku</i> learned that <i>Overwatch 2</i> would have a strong player-versus-environment element—something regular <i>Overwatch</i> players might have encountered in the game’s Halloween and anniversary seasonal events.</p>
      <p>Those events received mixed reactions at first, with some players citing how canned or static they felt. As the game aged, players received more dynamic PvE events, <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/04/overwatchs-new-pve-mode-is-terrific">like April, 2017's “Uprising</a>.”</p>
      <p>Last week, the leaks continued as Rod “Slasher” Breslau shared details about <i>Overwatch 2</i> <a href="https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/27939436/overwatch-2-feature-pve-new-map-least-one-new-hero">on ESPN</a>. The report claimed that <i>Overwatch 2</i> would offer more story and narrative, plus items and hero talents. Jeff Kaplan, the game's director, added that Push would be the core mode for ranked and casual play, and it will become the main competitive mode for the <i>Overwatch</i> League.</p>
      <p>More details incoming.</p>
