      <h1>New Zealand 12-8 Great Britain: 5 talking points as Lions fall to second straight tour defeat</h1>
      <h2>Wayne Bennett’s side again flatter to deceive in attack as a late Daryl Clark try is not enough to avoid defeat</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T06:33:05+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 06:33</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Walker, https://www.facebook.com/GarethWalkerMirror/</a></address>
      <p>Great Britain fell to a second defeat in eight days as Kenny Bromwich’s stunning late cover tackle earned New Zealand victory.</p>
      <p>Lions winger Jermaine McGillvary looked a certain scorer when Wayne Bennett’s side fashioned a rare chance with less than four minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>But back rower Bromwich produced a superb effort to knock the ball from McGillvary’s grasp as he dived for the line to preserve the Kiwis’ lead.</p>
      <p>Great Britain made minimal errors throughout, but again lacked a cutting edge, having gone in level at half-time at 2-2.</p>
      <p>Tries to Jamayne Isaako and Corey Harawira-Naera then put New Zealand in control, and despite Daryl Clark’s late response the Lions fell short again after losing to Tonga last weekend.</p>

        <i>Here are five talking points from the game....</i>

      <h3>1. Toothless Lions</h3>
      <p>Just two tries in two matches tells its own story.</p>
      <p>Great Britain had more possession and field position than they enjoyed against Tonga seven days earlier, but could do little with it.</p>
      <p>Time after time poor last tackle options and a lack of cutting edge saw promising positions come to nothing.</p>
      <p>With the game on the line the tourists became more expansive in the closing stages with Jackson Hastings increasingly prominent and Daryl Clark poaching a try - but it was not enough.</p>
      <p>The Lions have looked short on ideas throughout the tour so far despite picking a wealth of playmaking options - and now have minimal time to turn it around.</p>

      <h3>2. RTS magic</h3>
      <p>A key difference between the teams was undoubtedly brilliant Kiwis full-back Roger Tuivasa-Sheck.</p>
      <p>The New Zealand Warriors star made over 100 metres in the first half alone, with his quick feet too much for the Lions defence at times.</p>
      <p>He came up with a key play to escape from his own in goal area, and then produced a blistering second half break to create Jamayne Isaako’s opening try.</p>
      <p>In short, RTS - as he is known Down Under - was the line breaker Great Britain were lacking.</p>

      <h3>3. Foran’s heartache</h3>
      <p>New Zealand stand-off Kieran Foran was pulling a Kiwis shirt on for the first time since May 2017 after forcing his way back into contention at the expense of Shaun Johnson.</p>
      <p>But his return was cruelly cut short when he was forced from the field in just the sixth minute after dislocating his shoulder.</p>
      <p>It looked a devastating blow for the Kiwis to lose a key playmaker so early in the contest.</p>
      <p>But Michael Maguire’s side adapted well with Melbourne Storm’s Jahrome Hughes stepping up alongside Benji Marshall.</p>

      <h3>4. Ruck frustrations</h3>
      <p>Throughout the game, Wayne Bennett’s side were regularly frustrated by the speed of the play-the-balls as they attempted to build some momentum up front.</p>
      <p>The issue boiled over in the closing stages when John Bateman objected to another messy ruck and ended up grappling with Roger Tuivasa-Sheck.</p>
      <p>James Graham was asked about the issue after the game and made reference to the fact international matches only have one referee as opposed to the two in the NRL.</p>
      <p>But, as Graham pointed out, it was the same for both sides - and New Zealand seemed to cope better.</p>

      <h3>5. What now for Lions?</h3>
      <p>Skipper Graham was also asked about needing a response next weekend, and answered that the Lions have little option.</p>
      <p>After 12 years without playing, the triumphant return of Great Britain rugby league is in danger of fizzling out forgettably.</p>
      <p>Consecutive defeats to Tonga and New Zealand are bad enough, but the style of play has failed to enthuse supporters and matches have been played in half empty stadiums.</p>
      <p>The tour now moves to Christchurch and it needs a major lift on all fronts</p>
