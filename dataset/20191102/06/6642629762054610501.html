      <p>Palestinian media reported that the assault targeted several training sites and outposts <a href="https://www.maannews.net/Content.aspx?id=999225">affiliated</a> with Hamas, the group that rules the besieged <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/city/gaza.html">Gaza Strip</a>.</p>
      <p>Witnesses at Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis said the three were sitting in an orchard adjacent to one of the posts that was hit.</p>
      <p>The strikes came after the Israeli military said that Palestinians fired 10 rockets from Gaza into <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/israel.html">Israel</a> late on Friday, eight of which were intercepted. It said that the series of strikes were carried out in response to the rocket fire.</p>
      <p>There were no reports of casualties. Israeli police said shrapnel damaged a house in the southern town of Sderot and video footage showed a car near the structure with windows blown out by debris.</p>
      <p>It was the second consecutive day that the Israeli army reported rocket fire from the coastal enclave.</p>
      <p>None of the armed groups in Gaza claimed responsibility for firing the rockets. The Israeli military said Hamas was responsible for the incidents.</p>
      <p>Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since 2007, when the latter seized control of Gaza.</p>
      <p>Since then, Israel and Egypt have imposed a crippling blockade on the enclave. Unemployment in the area stands at 52 percent, according to the World Bank, and poverty is widespread.</p>
      <p>Israel says the blockade is necessary to stop weapons reaching Hamas.</p>
      <p>Hamas says that it is committed to an unofficial ceasefire deal with Israel, but some armed factions in Gaza act independently of the group.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Friday, health officials said that scores of Palestinians were wounded by live fire during protests against the blockade along the Gaza separation fence.</p>
      <p>The weekly demonstrations began last year.</p>
      <p>International mediators, including Egypt and Qatar, oversee the ceasefire deal to reduce the intensity of the protests in return for Israeli concessions and a monthly <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/qatar-begins-distributing-cash-gaza-residents-190126114010619.html">Qatari cash delivery</a> to Gaza.</p>
