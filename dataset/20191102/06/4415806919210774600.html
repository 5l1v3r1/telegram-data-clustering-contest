      <p>Lady Gaga will reportedly star in Sir Ridley Scott’s upcoming film about the tumultuous Gucci fashion dynasty.</p>
      <p>In her first film role since her Oscar-nominated turn opposite Bradley Cooper in A Star Is Born, the singer and actress is set to appear in a retelling of the assassination of Maurizio Gucci, the grandson of the firm’s founder.</p>
      <p>According to US outlet Deadline, Gaga will play Gucci’s ex-wife Patrizia Reggiani, who was found guilty of orchestrating his death.</p>

      <p>She served 18 years in prison before being released in 2016.</p>
      <p>Gaga, 33, earned critical praise for A Star Is Born and was nominated for best actress at this year’s Academy Awards, missing out to British actress Olivia Colman.</p>
      <p>But the performer, whose real name is Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, did win the Oscar for best original song for Shallow, one of the breakout hits from the film.</p>
      <p>In a case that captivated Italy, Gucci, at one time the head of the revered fashion house, was shot and killed by a hitman outside his office in 1995.</p>
      <p>Reggiani, a socialite and high fashion personality, was convicted of orchestrating the murder. In an attempt to get the verdict overturned, her two daughters argued a brain tumour had affected her behaviour.</p>
      <p>She was eventually freed in 2016. In an interview with the Observer newspaper, Reggiani said: “If I could see Maurizio again I would tell him that I love him, because he is the person who has mattered most to me in my life.”</p>
      <p>Sir Ridley’s last film was crime thriller All the Money in the World. He was forced into last-minute re-shoots when Kevin Spacey was replaced by Christopher Plummer due to allegations of sexual misconduct.</p>
