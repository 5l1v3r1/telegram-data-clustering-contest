      <p>Shinoda teased the release earlier in the week when he posted <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4PySAvj9BR/?utm_source=ig_web_options_share_sheet">an image displaying the track’s release date</a> (November 1) to social media. He followed it up the next day with a similar image but also including a snippet of the song and its title.</p>
      <p>It was liberated in full after Shinoda posted the song’s artwork alongside the lyrics: “<i>Tell all the children to lock those doors /  I’ve seen the smoke in the sky before / Gotta be up on my feet / When the morning comes ‘Cause this fight you can’t ignore / Everything is gonna be fine. </i>“</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/listen-two-new-songs-mike-shinoda-2452854">Shinoda shared two new songs called ‘Prove You Wrong’ and ‘What the Words Meant’.</a> The tracks appear on the deluxe edition of Shinoda’s solo debut, 2018’s ‘Post Traumatic’.</p>
      <p>The musician released his first solo album in June last year, almost 12 months on from the <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/linkin-parks-chester-bennington-died-aged-41-2113661">death of his Linkin Park band member, vocalist Chester Bennington</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/mike-shinoda-on-linkin-park-recruiting-a-new-singer2450478-2450478">Speaking on the possibility of recruiting a new vocalist for Linkin Park in an interview</a>, Shinoda said: “That’s not my goal right now. I think it has to happen naturally. And if we find somebody that’s a great person that we think is a good personality fit and a good stylistic fit, then I could see trying to do some stuff with somebody.”</p>
