      <h1>Adoption Groups Could Turn Away L.G.B.T. Families Under Proposed Rule</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T20:38:43+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 20:38</time> by <a rel="author">Derrick Bryson Taylor</a></address>
      <p>A proposed rule by the Trump administration would allow foster care and adoption agencies to deny their services to L.G.B.T. families on faith-based grounds.</p>
      <p>The proposal would have “enormous” effects and touch the lives of a large number of people, <a href="https://www.familyequality.org/people/denise-brogan-kator/">Denise Brogan-Kator</a><a href="https://www.familyequality.org/people/denise-brogan-kator/">, chief policy officer at Family Equality</a>, an advocacy organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender families, said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Department of Health and Human Services on Friday <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/11/01/hhs-issues-proposed-rule-to-align-grants-regulation.html">released the proposed rule</a>, which would roll back a 2016 discrimination regulation instituted by the administration of President Barack Obama that included sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes.</p>
      <p>Any organization — including foster care and adoption agencies or other entities that get department funding — is “now free to discriminate” if it wants to, Ms. Brogan-Kator said.</p>
      <p>The proposed rule could be published in the Federal Register as early as Monday, followed by a 30-day comment period. After that, the comments will close and it will become final rule.</p>
      <p>Critics, such as Ms. Brogan-Kator, said the rule would allow organizations to place their personal religious beliefs above the needs of children in their care, but the administration countered that it was not preventing L.G.B.T. people from adopting.</p>
      <p>“The administration is rolling back an Obama-era rule that was proposed in the 12 o’clock hour of the last administration that jeopardizes the ability of faith-based providers to continue serving their communities,” the White House said in a statement on Saturday. “The federal government should not be in the business of forcing child welfare providers to choose between helping children and their faith.”</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://adoptionnetwork.com/adoption-statistics">Adoption Network</a>, there are more than 400,000 children in the foster care system in the United States. More than 114,000 cannot be returned to their families and are waiting to be adopted.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/same-sex-parenting/">Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law estimated in a report</a> that 114,000 same-sex couples in 2016 were raising children in the United States. Same-sex couples with children were far more likely than different-sex couples with children to have an adopted child, 21.4 percent versus 3 percent, the report found.</p>
      <p>Alphonso David, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, <a href="https://www.hrc.org/blog/hrc-trump-attacks-lgbtq-people-religious-minorities-with-proposed-hhs-regul">in a statement</a> called the proposal “horrific” and said it would “permit discrimination across the entire spectrum of HHS programs receiving federal funding.”</p>
      <p>“The Trump-Pence White House is relying on the same flawed legal reasoning they’ve used in the past to justify discrimination against L.G.B.T.Q. people and other communities,” he said.</p>
      <p>Tony Perkins, the president of <a href="https://www.frc.org/about-frc">Family Research Council</a>, a group that supports socially conservative and Christian causes, said on Friday that the news was “tremendous” for children, birth moms and adoptive families.</p>
      <p>“Thanks to President Trump, charities will be free to care for needy children and operate according to their religious beliefs and the reality that children do best in a home with a married mom and dad,” Mr. Perkins said <a href="https://www.frc.org/pressrelease/family-research-council-applauds-trump-administration-for-protecting-faith-based-adoption-providers">in a statement</a>.</p>
