      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T20:00:14+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/sports/football/360717-epl-mane-walker-seal-comeback-wins-for-man-city-liverpool.html" target="_blank">Tunde Eludini</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool and Manchester City survived huge scares on Saturday as they had to come from behind to record identical 2-1 victories over Aston Villa and Southampton in their respective Premier League ties.</p>
      <p>Kyle Walker and Sadio Mane provided the crucial goals that ensured the top two team secure maximum points from their weekend games.</p>
      <p>James Ward-Prowse gave the Saints a shock lead after 13 minutes and they showed great character to hold on despite a City onslaught until 20 minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Sergio Aguero equalised in the 70th minute and then Walker secured the win four minutes from time.</p>
      <p>At Villa Park, Mane was Liverpool’s hero with his vital late goal</p>
      <p>Trezeguet had given the home side the lead after 22 minutes but after heavy pressure in the second half, Andy Robertson equalised for the Reds.</p>
      <p>With three minutes remaining to salvage Liverpool’s unbeaten record in the league this season, Mane popped up and struck deep into injury time.</p>
      <p>With this development, Liverpool were able to keep their six points advantage at the summit of the table for another week.</p>
      <p>In the day’s early kickoff, Joshua King scored the only goal of the match as Bournemouth recorded a 1-0 win over Manchester United at the Vitality Stadium.</p>
      <p>The former United youngster struck just before the interval as Eddie Howe’s side moved into sixth position in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils dropped to eighth as they lost for the fourth time in the league this season.</p>
      <p>At the Emirates stadium, it was another disappointing day for Arsenal as they were forced to a 1-1 draw by Wolverhmapton.</p>
      <p>This the third time in six days the Gunners will be pegged back as more pressure is heaped on Unai Emery with this latest stalemate.</p>
