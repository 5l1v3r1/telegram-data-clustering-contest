        <b>A French soldier has been killed in Mali after his armoured vehicle was struck by a roadside bomb, France's presidency said in a statement Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Corporal Ronan Pointeau died near Menaka in eastern Mali following "the detonation of an improvised explosive device as his armoured vehicle drove by," the statement said.</p>
      <p>President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to Pointeau's "sacrifice" and said his thoughts were with the soldier's colleagues and "his Sahelian brothers in arms, who are paying a heavy price in the fight against terrorism."</p>
      <p>The Sahel region is the scene of repeated clashes between jihadists and local forces backed by troops from Western countries.</p>
      <p>Pointeau's death follows an attack on Friday in the same region that left 49 Malian soldiers dead.</p>
