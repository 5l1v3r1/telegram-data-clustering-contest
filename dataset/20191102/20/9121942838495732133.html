      <p>NONTHABURI, Thailand (AP) — Leaders from fast-growing Southeast Asian economies, China, Japan and other regional powers are meeting in Bangkok for an annual summit that President Donald Trump is skipping so that he can campaign back home.</p>

      <p>Prayut says the aim was to have a final deal by next year.</p>
      <p>ASEAN also hopes to set a code of conduct with China regarding disputed waters in the South China Sea.</p>
      <p>Chinese Premier Li Keqiang says Beijing was intent on maintaining stability in the region in turbulent times.</p>
