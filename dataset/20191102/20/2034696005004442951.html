      </ul>
      <p>In the 1992 movie, Madsen’s character meets his maker at the hands of Roth’s character Mr. Orange, who doubles as an undercover cop, during the climax of Tarantino’s debut film.</p>
      <p>In new documentary <i>QT8: The First Eight</i>, Madsen reveals that he didn’t want to be killed by Roth, who at the time was an unknown actor.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know why [Tarantino] had me stuck in his head to play Mr. Blonde,” Madsen says in the documentary. “I didn’t want to play Mr. Blonde. I didn’t want to get shot by Tim Roth. I didn’t want to be killed by Tim Roth.”</p>
      <p>He continued, “I was like, ‘Hey man, who is Tim Roth?’ I would let Harvey Keitel kill me, but I’m not getting killed by Tim Roth.”</p>
      <p>At the time of production, Madsen had appeared in movies such as <i>Thelma &amp; Louise</i>, <i>The Natural </i>and <i>WarGames</i>, while Roth was relatively new to the American film industry with just a few acting credits to his name outside of the UK.</p>
      <p>Both actors went on to star in a number of other Tarantino projects. Madsen appeared in <i>Kill Bill </i>and <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i>, while Roth starred in <i>Pulp Fiction</i> and <i>Four Rooms</i>. The pair also reunited in Tarantino’s <i>The Hateful Eight </i>in 2015.</p>
      <p><i>QT8: The First Eight</i> arrives in the UK on December 13 and explores the making of Tarantino’s first eight movies.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/quentin-tarantino-refuses-recut-upon-time-hollywood-chinese-market-2558926">Quentin Tarantino will not recut <i>Once Upon A Time… In Hollywood</i> for the Chinese market</a> in the wake of Chinese regulators pulling it a week before its scheduled release.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the director is taking a take-it-or-leave-it stance after the acclaimed movie, which was due to be released in China on October 25, has been put on hold indefinitely.</p>
