      <h1>Paul Heckingbottom reveals Bobby Madden chat as Hibs boss slams offside decision</h1>
      <h2>The Hibs gaffer reckons his side aren't getting any luck as they were heavily beaten by Celtic at Hampden.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T20:43:19+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 20:43</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Hibs boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Paul Heckingbottom</a> insists his side aren't getting any luck as he bemoaned the lack of an offside flag for Celtic's second goal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/odsonne-edouard">Odsonne Edouard</a> was offside but assistant Douglas Ross failed to raise his flag and Callum McGregor scored after being set up by the Frenchman.</p>
      <p>That frustrated the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> boss as it put <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> two in front after just 20 minutes and he revealed he spoke to Bobby Madden at half time to ask for a break.</p>
      <p>Ross also wrongly disallowed a goal when Hibs played Elgin in the group stage of the competition and Heckingbottom isn't impressed.</p>
      <p>He said: "The same linesman as Elgin as well.</p>
      <p>"We're used to it now. I said to Bobby (Madden) coming out at half time, 'come on give us a break'</p>

      <p>"You know I don't sit here and moan about that but that is fact, we are getting them all the time.</p>
      <p>"The second one today, three chalked off, two red cards we are getting them all the time.</p>
      <p>"As much as we focus on ourselves to do our bit there should be more scrutiny, more accountability and I don't think there is.</p>
      <p>"It always costs us. It could have been 1-1, so it has definitely contributed, it would be nice if they could get them right all the time.</p>
      <p>"The offside one is a black and white one."</p>
      <p>Pressure is building on Heckingbottom supporters aiming abuse at the Easter Road gaffer as their side were beaten.</p>
      <p>But the former Barnsley manager insists he can turn things around.</p>
      <p>He said: "Yes. 100 per cent. </p>
      <p>"It's out of my control, I certainly won't be involved in the decision on my own future. </p>
      <p>"All we keep doing is keep working and keep pushing. We have to deal with out there's no point sulking about it."</p>
