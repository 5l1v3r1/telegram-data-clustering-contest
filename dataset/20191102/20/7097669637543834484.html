      <h1>Women killed by falling rocks climbing California's Red Slate Mountain</h1>

      <p>The bodies of two women who were killed by falling rocks while climbing a narrow portion of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/California">California</a>'s Red Slate Mountain have been recovered.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Shedden, 34, and 22-year-old Michelle Xue, never returned from a narrow and icy portion of the mountain after embarking on the trek during the final weekend of October.</p>
      <p>Their bodies were later discovered still hooked into the ice by a search-and-rescue team earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Poor weather conditions hampered efforts to recover the bodies, leading to a three-day retrieval effort.</p>
      <p>“It appeared that the women, though very prepared and well-equipped were struck by [a] large rock fall event,” the rescuers said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The Mono County Sheriff’s Office said rescuers climbed nearly 1,100 feet to the women, facing “active rock fall from the terrain above”.</p>
      <p>At one point “discharging rocks” that forced them to turn around.</p>
      <p>The rescuers, who were airlifted by a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/national-guard">National Guard</a> helicopter to the base of the region where the women were found, were unable to retrieve the bodies themselves due to the weather, rock fall and loss of sunlight.</p>
      <p>Various agencies deployed rescue teams in multiple attempts to recover the women, from Mono County Search and Rescue to the California Highway patrol.</p>
      <p>The retrieval effort ended when a Yosemite Search and Rescue helicopter managed to place two rescuers onto the ice sheet who were able to recover the bodies, the <i>Record-Courier</i> newspaper reported,</p>
      <p>Ms Xue was reportedly an experienced climber who was the safety captain of her school’s rock climbing team at Georgetown University.</p>
      <p>Ms Shedden was an associate engineer for the town of Mammoth Lakes. Both women were from California.</p>
      <p>“The Mono County Sheriff’s Office holds Jennifer, Michelle and their families and friends in our hearts and thoughts during this difficult time,” it said in a statement.</p>
