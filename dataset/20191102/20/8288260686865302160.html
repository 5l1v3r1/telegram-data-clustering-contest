      <p>Craig Revel Horwood moved to issue a sly jibe at Neil Jones on tonight's Strictly Come Dancing.</p>
      <p>Alex Scott, the former Arsenal star who is paired up with Neil for the show, has been forced to perform with Kevin Clifton instead.</p>
      <p>Kevin stepped into the breach to replace Neil, who suffered an injury in training, for the second week running.</p>
      <p>Revel Horwood told her "this accidental partnership is working wonders", giving her a seven, while Mabuse praised her "huge improvement in everything", giving her an eight alongside Ballas and Tonioli.</p>
      <p>Will Bayley is in the audience to watch the taping of Strictly Come Dancing after pulling out of the show due to injury.</p>
      <p>Host Tess Daly said: "As you may have heard, Will can no longer take part in the competition due to a knee injury."</p>

      <p>She added: "We love you will."</p>
      <p>Co-host Claudia Winkleman also referred to the injury suffered by professional dancer Neil Jones, who is partnered with Alex Scott, confirming Kevin Clifton will dance in his place.</p>
      <p>She said: "Neil, we look forward to seeing you back on the dancefloor very soon."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>During their performance, Alex Scott and Kevin Clifton said they were dancing for Scott's partner Jones as he recovers from injury.</p>
      <p>Rehearsal footage showed Jones on crutches, breaking the news to his partner that he has a grade one strain.</p>
      <p>Recalling the accident during rehearsal last week, he said: "I think we had only done a couple of steps and I couldn't move it anymore."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Video from Thursday saw him telling Scott and Clifton: "I've just been to physio and I'm still not 100% for Saturday, so Kev it's over to you."</p>
      <p>Clifton said: "We are doing this for Neil, he's been there every step of the way and we just want to do him proud."</p>
