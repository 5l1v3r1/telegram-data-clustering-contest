      <h1>With Benavidez wanting answers, Henry Cejudo says Dana White ‘can’t force me to fight someone’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T20:00:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Harry Davies</a></address>
      <p>With top flyweight contender demanding answers from the division’s champion, Henry Cejudo has said he won’t be ‘forced’ by UFC president Dana White into fighting someone he doesn’t want too.</p>
      <p>Cejudo, who is also the current UFC bantamweight champion, feels he has ‘leverage’ holding belts in two different divisions. With White keen on “The Messenger” dropping back down to 125-pounds to face Benavidez, who is unbeaten in three fights and has a win over Cejudo, the two-division champ told <a href="https://youtu.be/vzjIf-Z0FbE">Brendan Schaub</a> he won’t be forced into the fight.</p>
      <p>“Dana can say what he wants, and he’s the president and what not, but when you own two weight classes, when you have some kingdoms, I think I have the leverage,” Cejudo said. “No one’s going to force me to fight someone that I don’t want.” (Transcription via <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/10/henry-cejudo-leverage-wants-frankie-edgar-or-dominick-cruz-not-joseph-benavidez-ufc">MMA Junkie</a>)</p>
      <p>With the UFC’s bantamweight division heating up as former champions Frankie Edgar and Jose Aldo drop down to 135-pounds, Cejudo prefers the options at that weight class instead of making a tough 25-pound weight cut down to flyweight.</p>
      <p>“I like Frankie Edgar. I like the Dominick Cruz right now,” Cejudo said. “That’s what’s jumping at me. As much as Joe does have a victory over me … but at the end of the day, it’s cutting the weight, man – especially being up at ’35 and then feeling good, and having a good camp, and just being more happy. Be more happy, literally – like, I cut 25 pounds to get down to ’25.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to end up finishing my career at bantamweight, 100 percent.”</p>
