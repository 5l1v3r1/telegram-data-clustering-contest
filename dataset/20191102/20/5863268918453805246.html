      <h1>Landmine kills nine children in Afghanistan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T20:57:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 20:57</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>KUNDUZ (AFP) - A landmine explosion killed nine children in northeastern Afghanistan on Saturday, an official said, amid an increase in civilian casualties in the long-running and brutal war.</p>
      <p>The blast happened in volatile Darqad district of Takhar province, when the children stepped on a mine that had been planted on a road in a Taliban-controlled village.</p>
      <p>"At 8:30am (0400 GMT) this morning, tragically, nine schoolchildren were martyred in a landmine blast planted by the Taliban," Jawad Hejri, a spokesman for the Takhar provincial governor, told AFP.</p>
      <p>He said the children -- all boys -- were aged from seven to 11.</p>
      <p>No group claimed responsibility for the blast, and the Taliban did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>Last month, the United Nations released a report saying an "unprecedented" number of civilians were killed or wounded in Afghanistan from July to September this year.</p>
      <p>The figures -- 1,174 deaths and 3,139 injured from July 1 until September 30 -- represent a 42 percent increase compared to the same period last year.</p>
      <p>The UN laid most of the blame at the feet of "anti-government elements" such as the Taliban, who have been carrying out an insurgency in Afghanistan for more than 18 years.</p>
      <p>In May, a landmine killed seven children and wounded two more in the southern province of Ghazni.</p>
      <p>A month earlier, seven children were killed and 10 more wounded in the eastern province of Laghman when a mortar shell exploded while they were playing with it.</p>
      <p>The insurgents often use roadside bombs and landmines to target Afghan security forces, but the lethal weapons also inflict casualties on civilians.</p>
      <p>Years of conflict have left Afghanistan strewn with landmines, unexploded mortars, rockets and homemade bombs -- and many are picked up by curious children.</p>
