      <p>The Crusaders led 17-7 at the half and on the first play of the third quarter Terrell Prince forced a fumble and Kendrick Knight recovered on the Lehigh 33. Degenhardt cashed in with his touchdown pass six plays later.</p>
      <p>Tyler Monaco cut the deficit to 10 on a 33-yard hookup with Devon Bibbens after an interception, and a field goal with 6:41 to play provided the final points. Monaco was 26 of 39 for 282 yards.</p>
      <p>Holy Cross had a 388-319 yard advantage in total offense, with a 266-37 difference in rushing. Both teams had two turnovers, but Holy Cross had four sacks.</p>
