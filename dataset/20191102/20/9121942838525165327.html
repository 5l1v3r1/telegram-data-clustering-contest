      <p>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Ryan Hilinski was 24-for-31 for 235 yards and Bryan Edwards caught a school record 14 passes as South Carolina beat Vanderbilt 24-7 on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>With receiver Shi Smith out injured, Edwards shouldered the offensive load for the Gamecocks (4-5, 3-4 Southeastern).</p>
      <p>The senior sealed the win with a 25-yard touchdown catch midway through the fourth quarter. Edwards led South Carolina with a career best 139 yards receiving and his 14 catches matched four others for the school record — the last being Deebo Samuel in 2016. Edwards’ 38-yard punt return late in the third quarter flipped the field a defensive struggle.</p>
      <p>Freshman Deshaun Fenwick got his first action of 2019, running 18 times for 102 yards.</p>
      <p>The Commodores (2-6, 1-4) lost starting quarterback Riley Neal to injury after the first drive and, with Mo Hasan not playing, turned to third string Deuce Wallace. The junior was 8-for-17 for 30 yards and two interceptions.</p>
      <p>The SEC’s third leading rusher, Vanderbilt’s Ke’Shawn Vaughn, ran 20 times for 87 yards.</p>

      <p>South Carolina held the Commodores to 189 yards — just 112 of them after Vanderbilt scored a touchdown on its opening drive of the game. It was the Commodores’ worst offensive output since gaining just 77 in a 59-0 loss to Alabama in September 2017.</p>
      <p>It’s the least yards the Gamecocks have allowed since Florida gained just 183 yards in a crazy 44-11 win over South Carolina in October 2012.</p>
      <p>The Gamecocks have won 11 straight over Vanderbilt. South Carolina is the only SEC East team that the Commodores never beat this decade.</p>
      <p>THE TAKEAWAY</p>
      <p>Vanderbilt: The Commodores now have to win out to get to a second bowl game in a row. That’s a tough task with No. 6 Florida and surging Tennessee remaining on the schedule. It might be even tougher with the injuries. Leading receiver Kalija Limpscomb also did not play Saturday.</p>
      <p>South Carolina: The Gamecocks’ hopes of making a bowl in each of coach Will Muschamp’s four seasons with the program remains. But South Carolina has to find two wins in a finishing stretch with No. 20 Appalachian State, Texas A&amp;M and No. 4 Clemson. The Gamecocks are also struggling with injuries. Smith was out, running back Rico Dowdle missed a second game and tight end Nick Muse left with a knee injury in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>Vanderbilt heads to No. 6 Florida on Saturday.</p>
      <p>South Carolina hosts No. 20 Appalachian State on Saturday.</p>
