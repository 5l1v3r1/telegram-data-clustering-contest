      <h1>South African rugby fans celebrate World Cup victory</h1>

      <p>Johannesburg erupted into wild celebrations after South Africa's 32-12 victory over England in the World Cup final on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Led by captain Siya Kolisi, the Springboks dominated favourites England in Yokohama. Back home the party started after the final whistle gave South Africa their third World Cup.</p>
      <p>Superb game management, set-piece dominance, brutal defence and almost flawless place-kicking looked like being enough to see off an England side that had dismantled the double defending champion All Blacks in the semi-finals last week.</p>
      <p>The Springboks became the first team to lose a pool match at a World Cup and go on to win it, having lost to the All Blacks in their tournament opener at the same Yokohama International Stadium.</p>
      <p>Among the crowd in Jo'burg, there was praise for Kolisi and his men and one spectator said the victory had reunited the country.</p>
      <p>Even before the full-time whistle went, Sakhumzi bar in Johannesburg's Soweto township erupted into a frenzy of cheering and singing as South Africa closed in on a 32-12 victory over England.</p>
      <p>The crowd at this outdoor bar on Vilakazi Street in Soweto - made famous by being the home of two of the most celebrated resisters of apartheid - late former President Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu - reflected the harmonious multiracial society that South Africa still aspires to become.</p>
      <p>Black, white and some mixed-race fans donned springbok shirts and shared drinks as their team dominated against England to bring the cup back home.</p>
      <p>For many, this was South Africa's most unifying game of rugby since the 1995 final win against the All Blacks of New Zealand, when Mandela donned a Springbok jersey to unite a nation trying to heal the scars left over from racist white minority rule.</p>
      <p>Mandela had become his country's first black president just a year before South Africa won the 1995 World Cup.</p>
      <p>South Africans celebrated in the hometown of the Springboks captain, Siya Kolisi, as they watched their team beat England 32-12.</p>
      <p>The supporters watching in the Zwide Township were dancing and singing throughout as South Africa dominated England to claim their third Rugby World Cup crown.</p>
