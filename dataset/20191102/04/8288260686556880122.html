      <h4>Wolves plot January transfer window spree</h4>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers have been linked with a move for Lille defender Gabriel Magalhaes.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian, 21, is reportedly being eyed as cover for defender <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/willy-boly">Willy Boly</a> who faces an extended period out injured.</p>
      <p>Magalhaes, according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7639321/Wolves-eye-Lille-defender-Gabriel-Magalhaes-hunt-defensive-cover-injured-Willy-Boly.html">Daily Mail</a> , has been scouted by the Molineux hierarchy</p>
      <p>The report adds that <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> want to sign two new centre-backs, a midfielder and a forward in January when the transfer window re-opens.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Nuno previews Arsenal test</h4>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Nuno Espirito Santo has been discussing his side's trip to Arsenal tomorrow (3pm).</p>
      <p>Nuno takes <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> to the Emirates Stadium hoping to continue the good run of form that has seen the Molineux side go five Premier League matches unbeaten.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-aston-villa-player-ratings-17175214">last time out they lost 2-1 to West Midlands rivals Aston Villa</a> in the Carabao Cup, while Arsenal were also dumped out of the competition at Liverpool in a penalty shootout.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno</a> 's side will be hoping to evoke memories of the 2-0 win at back-to-back champions Manchester City last month, a game in which they weathered a storm before hitting their hosts on the counter-attack.</p>

      <h4>Arsenal reveal major Xhaka update</h4>
      <p>Granit Xhaka has been left out of Arsenal's squad for the visit of Wolverhampton Wanderers today (3pm).</p>
      <p>Xhaka was substituted during the 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace last weekend, the Arsenal captain heckled by his fans as he left the pitch.</p>
      <p>He took his shirt off and threw it to the ground and shouted obscenities at the fans before storming down the tunnel.</p>
      <p>The Swiss international was left out of the Carabao Cup defeat to Liverpool in midweek and head coach Unai Emery has decided he will not play any part in the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> clash.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Emery discusses Wolves clash</h4>
      <p>Arsenal head coach Unai Emery is anticipating a tough challenge when Wolverhampton Wanderers visit the Emirates Stadium tomorrow (3pm).</p>
      <p>Nuno Espirito Santo's side travel to North London <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-aston-villa-player-ratings-17175214">on the back of a 2-1 defeat to West Midlands rivals</a> Aston Villa in the Carabao Cup fourth round.</p>
      <p>In the Premier League, though, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> ' form has picked up in recent weeks with a winless start to the season curtailed at the end of September with a 2-0 defeat of struggling Watford.</p>
      <p>Wolves have since beat Manchester City by the same score and picked up vital wins in the Europa League.</p>
