      <p>AUSTIN, Texas: ESPN and Formula One signed a new three-year deal to continue to broadcast races in the United States, the all-sport network said on Friday (Nov 1).</p>
      <p>Formula One said the series had seen double-digit television viewership growth in the United States over the past two seasons since coverage returned to ESPN in 2018.</p>

      <p>Even so Formula One remains a niche sport in the United States with this weekend's grand prix in Austin, Texas, the only US stop on the glamour circuit.</p>
      <p>Through 18 races this season, Formula One is averaging 671,000 viewers on ESPN networks, an increase of 19 per cent on the average of 561,000 last year.</p>
      <p>In comparison, this year's Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and New England Patriots had the lowest audience in more than a decade while this year's Indianapolis 500 pulled in 5.4 million viewers.</p>
      <p>The Women’s College Softball World Series two-game championship series in June between the UCLA Bruins and Oklahoma Sooners averaged 1.5 million viewers, more than double the viewership of any Formula One race in the United States.</p>
      <p>"Our partnership with ESPN has delivered a 19 per cent increase in viewership across the US and we are delighted to extend our partnership through to 2022," said Sean Bratches, managing director, commercial partnerships, at Formula One in a statement.</p>
      <p>"The US is one of our key focuses for growth and ESPN know and understand the US sports audience like no one else.</p>
      <p>"The combination of their dedicated coverage and Formula One’s amazing racing spectacle is a perfect partnership for us to build on our recent success with US audiences."</p>
      <p>The new deal will see all races continue to air live and free of commercials on either ESPN, ESPN2 or ABC.</p>
      <p>All practice sessions, qualifying and races will air live and in replay across ESPN platforms.</p>
      <p>While Formula One has long coveted the US market the sport has never caught on.</p>
      <p>Until a state of the art track was constructed in Austin, the US grand prix had trouble finding a home with races in Indianapolis, Phoenix, Detroit and Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>Formula One has tried for years to put a second race in the United States but all attempts have ended in disappointment.</p>
      <p>Plans to stage a race in Miami in 2021 faced new obstacles this week when Miami-Dade County commissioners passed a resolution enabling them to prohibit road closures linked to racing events in or near residential areas.</p>
