      <p>LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- The cost of living continues to climb in the Southland.<br/><br/>ABC7's team of Community Journalists, who live in different areas of the greater Los Angeles area, share their tips and tricks on how to save money in SoCal.<br/><br/>Silver Lake Community Journalist, Sophie Flay, said she saves money by either making coffee at home or bringing a reusable coffee cup to a coffee shop.<br/><br/>"The average American spends around $20 a week just on coffee alone," Flay said. "Some coffee chains, like Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks, will give you a certain percentage off of your order if you use (a reusable coffee cup)."<br/><br/>"Inglewood home prices have surged 63% from 2014 to 2018," said Community Journalist Ashley Mackey.<br/><br/>The Community Journalist, who covers Inglewood, said she saves by living with family.<br/><br/>In Long Beach, Rachel Jordan said she saves on groceries by shopping at Grocery Outlet, where the company says prices are on average 60% lower than at traditional grocery stores.<br/><br/>"The company says the prices are so low because the items are excess inventory from packaging changes or manufacturing overruns," she said.<br/><br/>In East Los Angeles, Eric Resendiz saves money by meal prepping.<br/><br/>"The best part about meal prepping is that it helps me stay on track with my diet," he said.<br/><br/>Gabriela Milian, who covers the North San Fernando Valley, said she saves between $400 and $700 a month by living in a guesthouse.<br/><br/>"Oftentimes, the monthly rent includes utilities, WiFi, and sometimes parking," she said.</p>
