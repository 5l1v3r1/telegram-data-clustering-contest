      <p>X Factor: Celebrity duo Max and Harvey are begging Simon Cowell not to axe them from the show after dressing up as him for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> .</p>
      <p>The pair, who have made it to the second round of the live shows, shared the uncanny photo on their social media channels over the spooky holiday.</p>
      <p>Clad in an outfit which resembled the hard-faced mentor, the teenage heartthrobs posed in crisp white shirts and black trousers behind the judges' desk.</p>
      <p>But after posting the funny photo, the boys pleaded with Simon to not kick them off the show because of their Halloween prank.</p>
      <p>Max and Harvey captioned the pictures: "This is quite possibly the stupidest thing we've ever done. Happy Halloween everybody. And happy Halloween @SimonCowell please don't kick us off for this."</p>

      <p>Although Simon has yet to respond, fans have praised the singing pair for their joke and they love it.</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "Pure gold! This is iconic!", while another admitted it was "priceless".</p>
      <p>Their Halloween joke comes shortly after fellow contestant Brendan Cole was accused of making a rather "b****y" comment to the teen YouTube stars on the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> .</p>
      <p>As each of the contestants made their first live performance on the new series, Brendan was heard making a snarky comment about the 16-year-olds.</p>
      <p>As singing duo and social media sensations Max and Harvey took to the stage to perform, Brendan and Jeremy Edwards were seen eyeballing the teenagers.</p>

      <p>Brendan confessed as he watched: "They say they've got eight million across social media but the reality is they've only got a chunk on each, and it's all the same."</p>
      <p>But his comment sent  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>  into uproar as fans branded the star as "jealous" and "bitter".</p>
      <p>However, Brendan later apologised for his comment.</p>
      <p>In a post on  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , he wrote: "It did sound very bitchy (shame on me) but make no mistake...</p>
      <p>"You smashed your songs, our one song was pants and your talent speaks for itself.</p>
      <p>"I’m off with my tail between my legs and you are amazing! Soz boys! You are amazing."</p>
