      <p>The official Blizzcon opening keynote is about to kick off in an hour, and as you'd expect, there's always more leaks.</p>
      <p>A <i>Diablo</i> fan has got their hands on an early copy of an official <i>Diablo</i> art book ahead of its official release, and <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/10/let-the-diablo-4-and-overwatch-2-leaks-rain/">as expected</a> it's chockers full of concept art and designs showcasing the future of <i>Diablo</i>.</p>
      <p>A full image gallery <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/qtZJoNC">can be viewed here</a>, but two main things to call out: Lillith is firmed up as the main protagonist for <i>Diablo 4</i>. More importantly, the direction is a return to <i>Diablo</i>'s "dark, Gothic, medieval roots", according to <i>Diablo 4</i>'s art director.</p>

      <p>Signs outside of the Anaheim Convention Centre and inside the show both reiterated the opening keynote would have content that wasn't suitable for younger audiences. Given that <i>Diablo</i> is the most mature of all of Blizzard's franchises, it's the strongest possible indication that Blizzard intends to leave people on a Tristram-fuelled high. We'll know more in an hour how the game is panning out, so stay a while and listen.</p>
