      <p><b>FAISALABAD: </b>Pakistan has been put on the right track and the country can earn a position among top-20 economies of the world if it successfully documents its informal economy, said Ambassador of Italy to Pakistan Stefano Pontecorvo.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FCCI) on Friday, he said that the size of Pakistan’s economy was around $300 billion but 80% of it was undocumented.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that the country’s GDP may go down due to the measures taken for documentation of the economy, however, in the long term it would help the country prosper.</p>
      <p>Applauding the monetary steps, the envoy expressed optimism that Pakistan would soon become a hub of economic activity.</p>
      <p>Talking about the manufacturing of machinery, he said that Italy had been producing world-class products, which were costlier than the ones made in China.</p>
      <p>The ambassador shared that some Italian firms were negotiating with their Pakistani counterparts to launch joint ventures in different fields.</p>
      <p>Referring to the vast potential in the livestock sector, Pontecorvo called for initiating joint ventures in the field as it had a high margin of profit.</p>
      <p>Responding to various questions and queries, the ambassador assured businessmen of his cooperation in resolving the issues.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the occasion, FCCI President Rana Sikandar Azam thanked the ambassador for his services for enhancing relations between the two countries.</p>
