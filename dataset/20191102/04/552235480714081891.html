      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T04:30:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sally Hind, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sally-hind/</a></address>
      <p>Staff at an NHS psychiatric unit have raised safety fears after a man armed with a hammer was involved in a “siege”.</p>
      <p>Police were called to a disturbance at New Craigs psychiatric unit in Inverness on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/carry-matron-sex-pest-nurse-20455736">Sunday</a>, after a 28-year-old man, who was not a patient, allegedly entered the hospital with the weapon.</p>
      <p>He was arrested following the alleged incident on the Maree Ward, a mixed-sex, acute <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/carry-matron-sex-pest-nurse-20455736">mental health</a> admission unit for adults.</p>
      <p>He appeared in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/carry-matron-sex-pest-nurse-20455736">private</a> at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/carry-matron-sex-pest-nurse-20455736">Inverness</a> Sheriff Court on Monday where he faced two charges relating to possession of an offensive weapon in a public place and a breach of the peace charge.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Record understands staff at the unit have also penned a joint letter to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/carry-matron-sex-pest-nurse-20455736">Mental Welfare Commission</a> with fears over their safety at work.</p>
      <p>A source said staff were shaken following the alleged incident.</p>
      <p>They added: “A doctor had to defend himself and the staff were under siege.</p>
      <p>“The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/carry-matron-sex-pest-nurse-20455736">staff</a> on the ward have all come together to write to the Mental Welfare Commission because they are concerned for safety, which is unheard of for them to do that collectively.”</p>
      <p>Police Scotland confirmed officers were called to the ward on Sunday.</p>
      <p>They said: “Police Scotland can confirm that a 28-year-old man has been charged in connection with a disturbance at New Craigs psychiatric hospital on Sunday, October 27.</p>
      <p>“The man appeared at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/carry-matron-sex-pest-nurse-20455736">Inverness Sheriff Court</a> on Monday.”</p>
      <p>The man made no plea, was committed for further examination and remanded in custody.</p>
      <p>He is expected to appear again in court next week.</p>
      <p>NHS Highland said: “This is an ongoing police investigation and it would be inappropriate for us to comment.”</p>
