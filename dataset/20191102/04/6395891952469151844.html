      <p><b>JACKSON, Miss.Â (AP)</b> - The Latest on President Donald Trump campaigning in Mississippi (all times local):</p>
      <p>10 p.m.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump is citing the House impeachment inquiry as a reason that voters in Mississippi should vote for a Republican candidate for governor.</p>
      <p>Trump is in Mississippi trying to shore up Republican support for Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves.</p>
      <p>Trump says of the impeachment inquiry that "it always helps when you didn't do anything wrong."</p>
      <p>But he adds, "We're going to send a signal by sending a terrific new Republican governor to Jackson."</p>
      <p>Democratic candidate Jim Hood is wrapping up his fourth term as attorney general and making it a competitive race in a conservative Deep South state where Trump is popular.</p>
      <p>__</p>
      <p>8:20 p.m.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump is mocking former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke after he ended his Democratic presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>Trump said Friday that O'Rourke "came out of Texas a very hot political property, and he went back as cold as you can be."</p>
      <p>Trump is trying to energize voters in Mississippi as he campaigns for the Republican nominee for governor in next week's off-year election.</p>
      <p>Addressing supporters in Iowa, O'Rourke said Friday that he made the decision to exit the race "reluctantly" and vowed to stay active in the fight to defeat Trump</p>
      <p>Trump says, "Hopefully, we won't be hearing about him for a long time."</p>

      <p>President Donald Trump is reveling in the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as he campaigns for Republicans in Mississippi.</p>
      <p>U.S. special operations forces concluded a successful operation Saturday that ended with al-Baghdadi blowing himself up.</p>
      <p>Trump said Friday: "He was a savage and soulless monster, but his reign of terror is over."</p>
      <p>Trump says America's special forces executed a masterful raid and ended his wretched life, adding, "They punched out his ticket now, I guess you could say."</p>
      <p>Trump was in Mississippi to shore up Republican support for Lt Gov. Tate Reeves, who is locked in a tight race to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in next week's off-year election.</p>
      <p>Democratic attorney general Jim Hood is one of the most conservative elected Democrats in the country and is making it a competitive race.</p>

      <p>6:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump is too busy campaigning for GOP gubernatorial candidates to attend a pair of Asia summits this weekend in suburban Bangkok.</p>
      <p>That's according to a senior administration official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>The president is instead dispatching National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit and the East Asia summit.</p>
      <p>The U.S. official says, "The president and the vice president these next few days are going to be very engaged in campaigning."</p>
      <p>Trump was travelling to Mississippi Friday evening to campaign for GOP gubernatorial candidate Tate Reeves.</p>
      <p>Trump is scheduled to travel to Kentucky on Monday to campaign for incumbent GOP Gov. Matt Bevin. He heads to Louisiana on Wednesday to headline a rally for Republican gubernatorial candidate Eddie Rispone.</p>

      <p>Hundreds of people are waiting to see President Donald Trump at an arena in north Mississippi.</p>
      <p>He is traveling to the state Friday to try to shore up Republican support ahead of the state's toughest governor's race in nearly a generation, with two established politicians competing for the open seat.</p>
      <p>Republican Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves' opponent in Tuesday's race is Democrat Jim Hood, who is serving his fourth term as attorney general.</p>
      <p>Trump will hold an evening rally in the northern Mississippi city of Tupelo to support Reeves.</p>
