      <h1>Fact: The United States and Iran Came within Minutes of War Back in June</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T04:00:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Sebastien Roblin</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point: </b>America and Iran have recently come close to armed conflict.</p>
      <p>By most accounts, the United States and Iran came within minutes of armed conflict with each other on June 20, 2019. </p>
      <p>Around 4:30 AM that morning, a U.S. Navy RQ-4N Global Hawk spy drone flying a routine circuit over international airspace in the Persian Gulf<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/war-begins-how-iran-shot-down-us-rq-4n-surveillance-drone-63717"> was shot down</a> by an Iranian Ra’ad surface-to-air missile system.</p>
      <p>Later that day, U.S. forces were ostensibly “<a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/28629/heres-everything-we-know-about-the-u-s-strikes-on-iran-the-never-came">ten minutes</a>” away from striking three Iranian bases likely with air- and sea-launched missiles when President Donald Trump changed his mind and canceled the attack. He later cited concerns that killing an estimated 150 Iranians over the loss of an unmanned drone was a disproportionate response.</p>
      <p>Since the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from a nuclear deal with Iran in May 2018, it has waged a “maximum pressure campaign” on Tehran through economic sanctions. Iran had been<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear/iran-is-complying-with-nuclear-deal-restrictions-iaea-report-idUSKCN1LF1KR"> complying with the JCPOA nuclear deal</a>, which sharply restricted its nuclear technologies and opened sites to foreign inspectors in exchange for allowing Western companies access to the Iranian market. However, the deal’s critics complained the JCPOA did not regulate Iran’s<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/could-irans-missiles-do-unthinkable-sink-us-navy-aircraft-carrier-43087"> rapidly improving ballistic missile capabilities</a> nor address Iran’s involvement in the civil wars in Syria and Yemen, and support for Hezbollah.</p>
      <p>For one year, Tehran continued adhering to the JCPOA. However, the destabilizing effects of the new sanctions proved intolerable.</p>
