      <h1>Last gasp Hardwick penalty sees Leicester beat Glocuester</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T17:52:47+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 17:52</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>A last-minute <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/tom-hardwick/">Tom Hardwick</a> penalty saw a much-changed <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester">Leicester</a> deservedly beat <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester">Gloucester</a> 16-13 at Welford Road, registering their opening Premiership win of the season in the process.</p>
      <p>Tigers boss Geordan Murphy made nine changes to his squad from last week’s defeat against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens">Saracens</a> but, despite a dominant showing in the opening 40 minutes, they could only take a 10-6 lead into the interval.</p>
      <p>The afternoon could not have got off to a worse start for Gloucester when they lost captain <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/ed-slater/">Ed Slater</a> to the sin-bin for a shoulder charge on Tigers playmaker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/noel-reid/">Noel Reid</a> and, after Hardwick and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/billy-twelvetrees/">Billy Twelvetrees</a> had traded penalties, the young fly-half scored a solo try.</p>
      <p>Splitting the Gloucester defence five metres out, Reid tip-toed down the blind-side before barging past <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/gerbrandt-grobler/">Gerbrandt Grobler</a> to score his first try for the club since joining from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/leinster">Leinster</a> in the summer.</p>
      <p>Jordan Olowofela should have added a second on the half hour mark, with the young winger on the end of a free-flowing moving instigated off a Tigers lineout – but Telusa Veaninu couldn’t hold on to his inside pass.</p>
      <p>And, but for the rearguard efforts of the irrepressible <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/tom-marshall/">Tom Marshall</a>, Leicester would have been out of sight.</p>
      <p>The Gloucester full-back seemingly covered every blade of grass as he sought to stem the Leicester tide, keeping them in touch.</p>
      <p>It was fitting, then, that Marshall was at the heart of the Gloucester response, setting up an outstanding try for Joe Simpson.</p>
      <p>Combining with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/mark-atkinson/">Mark Atkinson</a>, Marshall set away the unusually quiet <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/ollie-thorley/">Ollie Thorley</a>, who ghosted past his man – before feeding Simpson to scamper over from 15 metres and put Gloucester three ahead at 13-10.</p>
      <p>With the Gloucester back division beginning to flex their muscles, the famous ‘16th man’ came into full effect, and the home faithful never stopped believing.</p>
      <p>Re-asserting their authority, Murphy’s charges drew level going into the final 10 minutes courtesy of a second Hardwick penalty as the decibel levels continued to rise.</p>
      <p>Led on by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/sam-harrison/">Sam Harrison</a>, a bundle of energy from minute one, Tigers went in search of a winner and after <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/sione-kalamafoni/">Sione Kalamafoni</a> was repelled, a scrum right in front of the posts presented a clear opportunity.</p>
      <p>The shove was textbook, giving referee Ian Tempest no choice but to award the penalty kick – which Hardwick belted over to give Tigers the lead with a minute left on the clock and the victory.</p>
