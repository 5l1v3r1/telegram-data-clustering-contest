It’s been an honor to rock stages and people of all ages with these guys. It’s been a great time and great memories in a short time.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “Rockin along side of Chuck and Tom has been amazing to say the least. It was fun while it lasted and I hope we left a big impression and that the music has been a source of inspiration for those that needed it. That was the purpose we got together. So I say to y’all stay informed, stay engaged and fight the good fight.”</p>

      <p>“It was about doing something greater than self. 2020 keeping Zack de la Rocha spot warm for RATM and powering a statement for 1000 days was a honorable truth mission in the hours of chaos from the jump… And so the bands rock on…. Let’s go.”</p>
