      <h1>Thai authorities re-open cave where football team was trapped in 2018</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T17:24:46+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 17:24</time> by <a rel="author">Euronews &amp; ReutersÂ </a></address>
      <p>Thai authorities have re-opened a famous cave where a local football team and their coach were trapped underground for weeks in 2018.</p>
      <p>The Tham Laung cave was re-opened on Saturday over a year since the 12 young players for the Wild Boar Academy and their coach were rescued in July 2018.</p>
      <p>The team, which had entered the cave on 23 June 2018, where trapped during a flash flood and had to survive on water dripping from the rocks.</p>
      <p>The international rescue effort was headline news across the world.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Duangporn Sookawong, 75, who came all the way from the southern Songkhla province, said she believed that the rescue was a miracle and the boys were lucky that they were able to survive despite being stuck in the dark, complex network of caves.</p>
      <p>In July, the Thai football team returned to Tham Laung a year since their dramatic rescue to honour a former navy who died in the rescue effort.</p>
      <p>They placed flowers next to a portrait of Sergeant Saman Kunan, a former member of an elite Thai Navy Seal unit, who died while he worked underwater.</p>
      <p>In April it was revealed that Netflix had agreed a deal to make a mini-series about the rescue, while two books have already been published about it.</p>
