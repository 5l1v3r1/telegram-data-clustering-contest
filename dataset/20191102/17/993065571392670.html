      <p>The BBC has privately apologised to former Tory MP Harvey Proctor after he walked out of a live interview with presenter Naga Munchetty.</p>
      <p>Mr Proctor lodged a formal complaint with the broadcaster after he cut short the BBC Breakfast interview on October 5, saying he had been prevented from speaking.</p>
      <p>He had appeared on the morning show to discuss the impact the disgraced Operation Midland had on his life, following false claims of a VIP paedophile ring.</p>
      <p>During an exchange via videolink, the former MP levelled accusations against the Met and its commissioner Dame Cressida Dick as Munchetty attempted to speak over him to read a statement from the force.</p>
      <p>The pair continued to talk over each other before Mr Proctor abruptly removed his earpiece and ended the conversation, saying: “I am sorry, I am not having this.”</p>
      <p>Mr Proctor, 72, told the PA news agency he had never walked out of an interview before in 50 years of public life.</p>
      <p>He filed a complaint with the BBC after it had previously dismissed complaints from viewers over his interview.</p>
      <p>Mr Proctor said BBC Breakfast editor Richard Frediani apologised to him in an email this week.</p>
      <p>Mr Frediani said Munchetty had been faced with a “genuine editorial difficulty” when he made the allegations about what Dame Cressida had said in an interview with another broadcaster and that she was “conscious of right to reply issues”.</p>
      <p>The email apologised that Mr Proctor was upset by the exchange and the subsequent response.</p>
      <p>In a response to Mr Frediani’s email, seen by PA, Mr Proctor wrote: “Thank you for your response to my complaint. I think somewhere in your words there was an apology trying to get out.”</p>
      <p>Mr Proctor asked the corporation to “be upfront” with its apology and publish its decision in line with how other complaints are treated.</p>
      <p>He said: “They have not gone through their normal procedure, as if a private apology will be sufficient.”</p>
      <p>He finished the response by telling Mr Frediani he was “grateful” for considering the complaint.</p>
      <p>“Please pass on to Naga Munchetty my regards. It is not personal. It is a matter of professionalism, both hers and mine,” he said.</p>
      <p>The BBC declined to comment.</p>
