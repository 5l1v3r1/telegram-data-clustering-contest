      <h1>Premier League round-up: Sadio Mane rescues Liverpool as Manchester City squeeze past Saints</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T17:15:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool left it late to maintain their six-point advantage at the top of the Premier League on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s men were facing their first defeat of the season with three minutes remaining as they trailed to Trezeguet’s 12th-minute goal for Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>It did not look like being Liverpool’s day – Roberto Firmino had an equaliser ruled out by VAR.</p>
      <p>However, Andy Robertson levelled in the 87th minute, with Sadio Mane then capping an impressive comeback with the winning goal four minutes into stoppage time.</p>

      <p>Title rivals Manchester City won by the same margin – and they were another team who did not have things all their own way in a game they were expected to win, edging Southampton 2-1.</p>
      <p>Saints, beaten 9-0 at home by Leicester in their previous Premier League outing, took a shock lead in the 13th minute at the Etihad Stadium with a goal from James Ward-Prowse.</p>

      </p>
      <p>There were only 20 minutes remaining when Sergio Aguero equalised – and the comeback was complete four minutes from time when Kyle Walker got the winning goal for the hosts.</p>
      <p>Arsenal were held to a 1-1 home draw by Wolves.</p>
      <p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, captaining the Gunners, netted his first goal in four games in the 21st minute, but Raul Jimenez levelled 14 minutes from time.</p>

      <p>Newcastle improved their survival hopes with a 3-2 victory at out-of-form West Ham.</p>
      <p>Ciaran Clark headed the visitors into a 16th-minute lead and Federico Fernandez doubled the advantage six minutes later.</p>
      <p>Jonjo Shelvey got a third six minutes into the second half and although Fabian Balbuena and Robert Snodgrass set up a nervy finish with goals inside the last 17 minutes, the Hammers are now without a win since September 22.</p>
      <p>Sheffield United continued their impressive start to the season with a 3-0 defeat of Burnley.</p>
      <p>The Blades had only scored three home goals prior to this contest but doubled that tally in the first 45 minutes against the Clarets.</p>
      <p>John Lundstram opened the scoring from close-range in the 17th minute and doubled the advantage soon after, tapping home a ball from Enda Stevens.</p>
      <p>John Fleck got a third goal for Chris Wilder’s team just before half-time.</p>
      <p>Goals inside the last quarter from Leandro Trossard and Shane Duffy gave Brighton a 2-0 home victory over struggling Norwich.</p>
      <p>In the early kick-off, Manchester United’s mini-revival ended as a superb solo goal from Joshua King earned Bournemouth a 1-0 victory at the Vitality Stadium.</p>
      <p>United had been seeking a fourth successive away win in the space of just 10 days to further ease growing pressure on manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>But King, who began his senior career with United, condemned them to a fourth Premier League defeat of the campaign by neatly swivelling past Aaron Wan-Bissaka to volley home moments before the break.</p>
