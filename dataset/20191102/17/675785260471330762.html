      <h1>Unai Emery issues defiant response when asked if his Arsenal job under threat</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal endured a 1-1 draw with Wolves, their third draw of the week, as Unai Emery's Gunners reign starts to stumble</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T17:53:34+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 17:53</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery has been quizzed about his Arsenal future after the Gunners' draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a>.</p>
      <p>The Gunners struggled to their third straight draw in all competitions, and for the third time this week gave up a lead as they shared the points with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves.</a></p>
      <p>Pierre Emerick Aubameyang had opened the scoring with a smart finish, having been laid on by Alexandre Lacazette, but Raul Jimenez fired back in the 76th minute to see <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> drop points in the Premier League for the seventh time this season.</p>
      <p>It was deja vu for Gunners fans who saw their side crash from a 2-0 lead to draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> last Sunday at the Emirates, before they were dumped out of the Carabao Cup by a youthful <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> side on penalties having led 5-4 going into stoppage time.</p>

      <p>Gunners fans showed their displeasure after the Wolves disappointment by booing the players off the pitch, while there were reports of "Emery Out" chants during the match.</p>
      <p>When asked following the game whether his job was under threat, Emery told reporters: I am very demanding myself and I feel my responsibility to work every time to come back with a better result in the next matches.</p>
      <p>And when asked about his contract, which is expires at the end of the season although has the option of an additional year, said: "We speak about how we can improve and how to achieve the best performance."</p>

      <p>Emery was naturally frustrated by the failure to win.</p>
      <p>"Itâ€™s disappointing," the Spaniard said. "I think the players tried and we scored the first goal but we needed a second for more confidence.</p>
      <p>"Wolves are consistent in playing matches like they did today and they did that again.</p>
      <p>"It was an equal match and maybe we deserved more.</p>
      <p>"I am frustrated because we are dropping points at home like we did last year.</p>
      <p>"We can improve that balance defensively.</p>
      <p>"But the key was to have more clear chances to take the result for us</p>
      <p>"The players feel the responsibility to win and when we draw they are sad.</p>
      <p>"I think they understand me."</p>
