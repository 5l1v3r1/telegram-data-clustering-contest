      <h1>Andy Ruiz Jr posts video of himself injecting fellow boxer in backside</h1>
      <h2>The heavyweight world champion injected a vitamin injection</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T17:33:17+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 17:33</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Andy Ruiz Jr has posted a bizarre video which shows him injecting a fellow boxer in the backside with vitamin B12.</p>
      <p>The heavyweight world champion is shown performing the procedure in the gym as he prepares for his rematch with Anthony Joshua in December.</p>
      <p>As he injections the substance into 19-year-old fighter Anthony Garnica, Ruiz says: "Guys, if you didn't know I'm not just a boxer, I'm a doctor as well, I give shots for free."</p>
      <p>Out of shot, someone can be heard saying the injection is vitamin B12.</p>
      <p>Such shots are a common way of preventing or treating a deficiency of the vitamin and are normally injected into a muscle.</p>

      <p>It is not clear if Garnica has a deficiency but there is no suggestion Ruiz has acted improperly.</p>
      <p>The Mexican-American stunned the boxing world in June when he dropped Joshua four times before stopping him in the seventh round.</p>
      <p>Ruiz only stepped in at six weeks' notice to replace drug cheat Jarrell Miller who tested positive for three banned substances.</p>
      <p>Ruiz will put his three newly-won heavyweight belts on the line in Saudi Arabia later this year in the rematch.</p>

      <p>And in a photo posted last week, the champion looks to have slimmed down ahead of his sequel with the Brit.</p>
      <p>Ruiz was pictured sitting on the ring apron with fellow heavyweight Michael Hunter who will face Alexander Povetkin on the Saudi Arabia undercard.</p>
      <p>The champion also explained what he said to Joshua in a recent face-off during their promotional tour.</p>
      <p>He said: "No, I don't plan on killing nobody, God wouldn't want that, but I'm sure he wants me to win and prove everyone wrong.</p>
      <p>"Everybody still doubts me, saying it was God's lucky punch but I told Joshua in his face that it was a punch from God because I've been praying and wishing for this opportunity my whole life and I took advantage of it."</p>
