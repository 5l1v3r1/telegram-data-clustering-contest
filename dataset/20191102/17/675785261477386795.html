      <h2>Of course they could sing! After apologising in advance for their terrible voices, ten British actors proved their talent as they recorded an album for Children In Need</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T17:53:39+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 17:53</time> by <a rel="author">Sara Wallis, https://www.facebook.com/SaraWallisMirror/</a></address>
      <p>This week we witnessed a BBC1 show that could have been called Oh My God, I Didn’t Know They Could Sing! For that is what we all said repeatedly for the entire hour-and-a-half.</p>
      <p>Celebrities trooped into the ­legendary Abbey Road recording studio for Children In Need: We Got It Covered, full of apologies about their terrible voices.</p>
      <p>LIES, it was all lies.</p>
      <p>In the latest idea for the charity, ten British actors all agreed to record an album. Not just a Band Aid-style song, singing a line or two, but a track each, inspired by their own lives.</p>
      <p>Never mind the songs, the casting was pretty inspired. Deep breath: Helena Bonham Carter, Jim Broadbent, Olivia Colman, Shaun Dooley, Luke Evans, Suranne Jones, Adrian Lester, Himesh Patel, David Tennant and Jodie Whittaker.</p>

      <p>Clearly TV producers wrote their wishlist and got it – the power of Pudsey at play. There were so many great moments. The Crown buddies Olivia and Helena casually discussing bathroom ­singing.</p>
      <p>“You always think you sound different than you actually do. A bit like how I get dressed in the morning,” said Helena.</p>
      <p>Olivia, who was either crying or on the verge of crying throughout, was nervous as hell.</p>
      <p>“I’d rather give birth again with no drugs,” she said, before quickly telling producers she was having a lovely time.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to be rude,” explained the most polite woman in telly.</p>
      <p>Oh and of course, she can sing. She can do anything, she’s a goddess.</p>
      <p>And then... Phoebe Waller-Bridge and her sister Isobel on ukuleles? This is why we pay our licence fees.</p>
      <p>It still hadn’t peaked. Taylor Swift ­sauntered in to surprise Shaun, who was mid-record of her hit Never Grow Up.</p>
      <p>Olivia starred in The Favourite with Taylor’s boyfriend Joe Alwyn and had texted in the favour. This was actors ­pulling strings live in action and I loved it. Who else does Olivia have in her contacts book? Who does she invite for dinner parties?</p>
      <p>Jodie lived out a teen fantasy when Coldplay’s drummer Will Champion and lead guitarist Jonny Buckland ­interrupted her “northern twang” ­rendition of Yellow.</p>

      <p>“Oh my god, I fully stalked you!” she squeaked.</p>
      <p>When they started playing, she giggled. But later, as she sang for her nephew Harry, who died aged three, she cried. Harry’s parents cried. We all cried.</p>
      <p>This film yo-yoed the emotions about from one extreme to the other.</p>
      <p>Adrian was beatboxing, Helena drank weird herbal teas and David told us he used to busk Proclaimers songs.</p>
      <p>They saved the best for last. Suranne giving it full on musical theatre lungs, with a backing choir of kids from a children’s theatre. Hearts fit to burst.</p>
      <p>This was proper happy telly that felt like a big warm Pudsey hug – and anyone who didn’t enjoy it is a cold-hearted cynic.</p>
