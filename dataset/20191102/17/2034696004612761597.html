      <p>Sharing the news during his headline performance at the Day N Vegas festival in Las Vegas last night (November 1), it will be Cole’ sixth studio album and follows 2018’s <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/j-cole-kod-review">‘KOD’</a>.</p>
      <p>Topping a bill that also featured <a href="http://nme.com/artists/miguel">Miguel</a>, <a href="http://nme.com/artists/lil-uzi-vert">Lil Uzi Vert</a>, <a href="http://nme.com/artists/juice-wrld">Juice WRLD</a> and <a href="http://nme.com/artists/6lack">6LACK</a>, Cole brought out Dreamville signees <a href="http://nme.com/artists/bas">Bas</a>, J.I.D., <a href="http://nme.com/artists/earthgang">EarthGang</a> and Cozz, which enabled him to debut songs from his ‘Revenge of the Dreamers III’ compilation live for the first time.</p>
      <p>During the show, a parody campaign video popped up on the screen. Featuring the message: “Fuck them taxes,” the video ended by saying, “Make your voice heard. Vote for The Fall Off 2020.”</p>
      <p>The crowd were also given posters to wave bearing ‘The Fall Off 2020’ graphics.</p>
