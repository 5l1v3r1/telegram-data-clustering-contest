      <p>Restaurants such as the Bearded Sailor in Leeds and the Cod’s Scallops in Nottingham are also hoping to hook the prize.</p>

      <p>London Belmont Bay Fish Bar in Harrow also made the cut.</p>
      <p>Each shop is carefully assessed by judges on a variety of elements including: sustainable sourcing policies, menu development and innovation and staff training policies.</p>
      <p>The quality of fish and chips on offer and the levels of customer service provided will also be put under the microscope.</p>
