      <h1>Teenage boy charged in Halloween shooting of seven-year-old girl in bumblebee costume</h1>

      <p>A 15-year-old boy has been charged with attempted murder after a seven-year-old girl was shot while she was trick-or-treating in a bumblebee outfit in <a href="http://independent.co.uk/topic/Chicago">Chicago</a>.</p>
      <p>The young girl, who was critically wounded while trick-or-treating for <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Halloween">Halloween</a> in the city’s West Side on Thursday, is believed to have been hit in the lower neck with a stray bullet.</p>
      <p>It is the latest in a string of shootings in the city which have seen innocent bystanders ensnared in crossfire.</p>
      <p>Investigators believe the youngster was shot in a gang-related attack and the man believed to be the target was a 30-year-old shot in the hand, police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said.</p>
      <p>The shooter was wearing a mask resembling the one worn by the character Jason in the <i>Friday the 13th </i>movies, Mr Guglielmi said, adding investigators had found a gun which may be the weapon used in the shooting.</p>
      <p>He said the young girl was in critical but stable condition on Friday.</p>
      <p>The 15-year-old was charged with two counts of attempted murder and two counts of battery through discharge of a firearm, police said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-little-village-shooting-20191031-lka6hkboqja7nhgxrljnlzvbqu-story.html">The <i>Chicago Tribune</i> reported</a> police believe the gunman is a member of the Gangster Two-Six gang and was targeting a member of the Latin Kings.</p>
      <p>The girl was trick-or-treating as a group of men chased another man down the street in the Little Village neighbourhood.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Rocco Alioto said the shooting was “unacceptable”.</p>
      <p>He added: “A seven-year-old girl that was trick-or-treating with her family had to get shot because a group of guys want to shoot at another male.”</p>
      <p>The girl was rushed to a hospital in critical condition after being shot, according to fire department spokesperson Larry Langford.</p>
      <p>The wounded man, who was shot in his left hand, was taken to a hospital in good condition.</p>
      <p>“We heard the shots... and I went outside,’’ Lali Lara, 25, who was working at a shop near the scene, told the <i>Chicago Tribune.</i></p>
      <p>“The girl’s father was screaming: ‘My little girl’s been shot!’”</p>
      <p>The shooting comes after a jury acquitted a man the day before Halloween who was charged with first-degree murder in the 2014 death of an 11-year-old girl who was shot while inside a house at a sleepover.</p>
      <p>It is also just days after <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump’s</a> first visit to Chicago since entering the White House back in January 2017.</p>
      <p>In his speech at the Chiefs of Police Annual Conference, the US president claimed Chicago was “embarrassing to us as a nation” and said “Afghanistan is a safe place by comparison”.</p>
