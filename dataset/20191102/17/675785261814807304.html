      <h2>Your prostate, your mood, cholesterol, blood pressure and a testicular cancer check are five clues that could help you on the road to a healthier life</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T17:50:11+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 17:50</time> by <a rel="author">Kelly Jenkins, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/kelly-jenkins/</a></address>
      <p>Men are notoriously bad at visiting the GP, with women 20 per cent more likely to seek help for a health condition.</p>
      <p>Yet one in five UK men die before the age of 65 – and charity Movember aims to cut premature male deaths by 25 per cent over the next decade.</p>
      <p>GP Dr Tony Steel says it is important men don’t ignore vital clues their health may be in serious trouble.</p>
      <p>He said: “You wouldn’t ignore the warning light on your car dashboard telling you there’s no petrol left, so why do that <br/>with your body when symptoms could be warning of something more serious?”</p>
      <p>Movember isn’t just about growing an impressive ­moustache – it’s also about helping men become more empowered around their health.</p>
      <p>Here are five checks that could help you or your partner on the road to a healthier life.</p>

      <h3>Test your prostate</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Why it’s important</b>
      </p>
      <p>Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, with nearly 42,000 diagnoses every year. One in eight men will get it in their lifetime, so it pays to be vigilant.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to reduce your risk</b>
      </p>
      <p>Maintaining a healthy weight can offer some protection, as <br/>can a diet high in lycopene – which is found in cooked and processed tomatoes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When to get checked</b>
      </p>
      <p>Symptoms include difficulty passing urine, a weaker stream, need to go more frequently, ­especially at night, or pain in the back or pelvis. It is vital to <br/>see a GP if you’re experiencing any of these symptoms. Men over 50 are also entitled to a test.</p>

      <h3>Monitor mood</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Why it’s important</b>
      </p>
      <p>Suicide is the leading cause of death for men aged between 20 and 49 in the UK. It is vital to pay attention to any feelings of ­hopelessness, extreme sadness, loss of interest in everyday life exhaustion, low sex <br/>drive or sleeping ­problems ­– all of which could indicate depression.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to reduce your risk</b>
      </p>
      <p>Talk to someone you trust, ideally at the first signs of ­depression. And regular exercise <br/>has also been proven to help boost the mood.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When to get checked</b>
      </p>
      <p>Visit your GP if you have any of the symptoms listed. They will discuss medication, therapy or a combination of both.</p>

      <h3>Testicular cancer check</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Why it’s important</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is the most common cancer in men under 35, with around 2,200 new cases diagnosed every year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to reduce your risk</b>
      </p>
      <p>Check yourself regularly by feeling carefully for swelling, lumps or texture changes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When to get checked</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you find any of the above, visit your GP for a testicle check. They may advise an ultrasound and blood test.</p>

      <h3>Check your blood pressure</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Why it’s important</b>
      </p>
      <p>Persistent high <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/ten-ways-banish-high-blood-9621402">blood pressure</a> can lead to strokes, heart ­disease and kidney problems</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to reduce your risk</b>
      </p>
      <p>Exercising for 30 minutes, four times a week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When to get checked</b>
      </p>
      <p>Men over 40 should be tested every three years.</p>
      <h3>Measure your cholesterol</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Why it’s important</b>
      </p>
      <p>It leads to heart disease, which can result in a heart attack.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to reduce your risk</b>
      </p>
      <p>Swapping to a Mediterranean-style diet rich in fruit, vegetables, fish and nuts can lower cholesterol.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When to get checked</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you are obese, over 40 or have a history of heart attacks in the family, visit your GP for a routine cholesterol check.</p>
