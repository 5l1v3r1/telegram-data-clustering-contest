      <h2>Pride Of Britain Award winners, including a former robber and a real-life superhero, spoke to Boris Johnson inside No. 10 about how they will use their trophies as “tangible symbols” of the qualities that make a nation proud</h2>

      <p>I took a Superhero to No. 10 Downing Street on Tuesday to have a quiet word with the Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>Adventureman – aka Jamie McDonald from Gloucester – doesn’t look like your typical Iron Man or Captain America.</p>
      <p>The big A is fading from the front of his green top, his tights have lost their lycra and he hasn’t got the bulk of Hulk or Wolverine.</p>
      <p>But Adventure­man left me marvelling at his bravery, resilience and generosity – qualities epitomised by the silver trophy in his right hand.</p>
      <p>It was the Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Award presented to Jamie at a star-studded ceremony which you can watch for yourself on ITV at 8pm on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Jamie, 33, won his gong because after overcoming a rare spinal condition he raised £1million for sick children by completing a staggering series of endurance challenges including running 5,500 miles across America in his hero costume.</p>

      <p>Jamie was joined at a No 10 party by other Pride of Britain winners – all heroes in their own right.</p>
      <p>As you’ll see in the uplifting awards show, they have triumphed over tragedy, selflessly saved lives and inspired others to live their best lives.</p>
      <p>Like Hezron Brown, 29, the Prince’s Trust Young Achiever who’s overcome a life of crime and homelessness to steer thousands of young people away from gangs and violence.</p>
      <p>When he was five he fell into a bath of boiling water and was left badly scarred.</p>
      <p>Other kids bullied him so badly he resorted to violence and got drawn into gang life.</p>
      <p>He was held at gun point and escaped stabbings, but it was the threat of a ten-year sentence for robbery that finally changed his life.</p>
      <p>Now both he and Jamie are motivational speakers, going into schools, colleges and companies to inspire, empower and bring people together.</p>
      <p>They spoke to Boris Johnson inside No. 10 too, telling him they will use their trophies as “tangible symbols” of the qualities that make a nation proud.</p>
      <p>And the PM told all the winners: “You’ve shown courage, determination and selflessness and, on behalf of the entire country, I say a big thank you.”</p>
      <p>Superheroes come in many forms but all have the power to change lives.</p>
      <p>Let’s hope they left a bit of magic behind at No 10.</p>
