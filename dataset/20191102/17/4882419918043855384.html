      <h2>Lionel Messi sent the Catalans ahead but the hosts came back with three goals in seven minutes</h2>

      <p>Barcelona let in three goals in seven minutes as Levante overturned Lionel Messiâ€™s penalty to hand the champions their first defeat in eight games.</p>
      <p>Jorge Miramon fouled Nelson Semedo in the area and Messi slammed home from the spot to hand Barcelona the lead shortly before half-time.</p>
      <p>Antoine Griezmann had missed the only real chance before that, denied by Aitor Fernandez after being slipped in by Leo Messi.</p>
      <p>Luis Suarez was taken off with a calf injury and Carles Perez replaced him, surprisingly brought on ahead of Ansu Fati - while Ernesto Valverde had left Ousmane Dembele at home.</p>
      <p>Jose Campana struck for Levante in the 61st minute, with Borja Mayoral and Nemanja Radoja netting after that as Barca were left rocking.</p>
      <p>Messi struck again after forcing his way through on goal but VAR revealed Griezmann was offside in the build up and Barca fell to defeat.</p>
