      <h2>Anne Diamond says politics shouldn't be so toxic, after 18 female MPs said they were standing down</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T17:12:40+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 17:12</time> by <a rel="author">Anne Diamond, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/anne-diamond/</a></address>
      <p>It has always been a man’s world in Westminster.</p>
      <p>I remember interviewing some feisty female MPs, including Margaret Thatcher, Betty Boothroyd and the amazing Barbara Castle, and they all told hair-raising stories about the misogyny they had to endure just trying to get their work done.</p>
      <p>From patronising ­remarks, sexual innuendo and even trying to find a loo, life was hard for a female MP.</p>
      <p>Then along came Blair’s Babes (how patronising was that phrase?) when Tony Blair became Prime Minister and there was an ­impressive influx of female MPs.</p>
      <p>Suddenly the idea of equality looked a distinct possibility.</p>
      <p>But where have they all gone? And more importantly, why have they disappeared?</p>

      <p>It is a matter of huge shame that they are quitting because of the abuse they face on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>Among Tory ranks, the female MPs stepping down are on average 10 years younger and have spent a decade less in parliament than retiring male MPs.</p>
      <p>Heidi Allen, the ex-Conservative MP who defected to the Liberal Democrats, has spoken of “the ­nastiness and intimidation that’s become commonplace”.</p>
      <p>Nicky Morgan and Amber Rudd, both valuable and experienced MPs, have both cited abuse as the reason they’re not standing again.</p>
      <p>Diane Abbott, shadow home ­secretary, has often spoken about the appalling abuse she receives online, and wants social media companies to record the real ­identities of people using their ­platforms to tackle the problem.</p>
      <p>She believes the fact that people are completely anonymous has made this problem worse.</p>

      <p>When the police try to track down the people abusing her, they find they can’t identify them.</p>
      <p>Our society has always been cruel to women who stick their head above the parapet.</p>
      <p>God forbid they should be opinionated, too!</p>
      <p> That’s why politics has always been a tough gig for women, and perhaps that’s why those who have endured it are so formidable.</p>
      <p>But it shouldn’t have to be so toxic.</p>
      <p>At least 18 female MPs have announced they are standing down at the general election.</p>
      <p>Very bright women will leave parliament – women who could make a difference, make Westminster a more balanced place, make our world fairer and more modern.</p>
      <p>Let’s hope there are plenty more women where they came from.</p>
      <p>Tory MP Matt Hancock said it was “heartbreaking” to see the number of colleagues stepping down because of the daily stream of online abuse.</p>
      <p>“No one, in any job, should be abused in this way. Surely we as a society can be better than this,” he said.</p>
      <p>Yes. But talking about it is not enough. We need action from the social media giants to identify these trolls and call them out.</p>
