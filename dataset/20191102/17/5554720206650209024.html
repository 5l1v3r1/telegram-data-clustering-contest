      <p>In the first leg, India had defeated USA 5-1 on Friday in their match played at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneshwar. However, they looked set to face the heartbreak on Saturday night when the US overcame their four-goal deficit and scored four quick goals in the first two quarters. However, Rani Rampal pulled one back to maintain the slender lead till the final hooter.</p>
      <p>There was hope for India in the 43rd minute when they were awarded a penalty corner. But Gurjit failed to convert the corner into a goal as her shot missed the target.</p>
      <p>It was left to Rani to pull off a spectacular goal in the 48th minute from a loose ball to give her team the much-needed lead over the two-leg encounter.</p>
      <p>USA were awarded a penalty corner four minutes from the final hooter, but the decision was overturned after India went for a referral.</p>
      <p>This is the second time in a row that the Indian women’s team have qualified for the Olympics.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the Indian men’s team also qualified for the Olympics after they beat Russia 7-1 in their second match taking their aggregate to 11-3. In their first match, the Indians had thrashed Russians 4-2.</p>
