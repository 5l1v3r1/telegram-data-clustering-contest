      <h1>'Mentality' - Liverpool fans are all saying the same thing after Aston Villa comeback</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa 1-2 Liverpool reaction | Andy Robertson and Sadio Mane capped a late turnaround for Jurgen Klopp's side at Villa Park after they trailed at half-time</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T17:09:01+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 17:09</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool fans are in dreamland after their late turnaround at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>They have beaten <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> 2-1 despite being 1-0 down until the final three minutes.</p>
      <p>Andy Robertson cancelled out Trezeguet's 21st minute opener before Sadio Mane put Jurgen Klopp's European champions ahead in the fourth minute of added time.</p>
      <p>That <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/aston-villa-liverpool-live-robertson-17188264">puts Liverpool six points clear of Manchester City at the top of the League</a> , Pep Guardiola's side themselves coming from 1-0 down to beat struggling Southampton at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And, as expected, Reds fans were full of joy at full-time and took to social media to express their thoughts on events at Villa Park on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Here's the pick of the reaction on social media after a fraught ending to the match...</p>
