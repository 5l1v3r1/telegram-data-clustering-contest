      <h1>US military calls on Kurdish forces in northeast Syria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T14:42:13+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 14:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.afp.com/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Qamishli (Syria) (AFP) - US military vehicles Saturday entered a Kurdish-held area in northeastern Syria and met with officials, AFP correspondents and a local source said, in the second such visit since an announced US pullout from the Turkish border area.</p>
      <p>Beige-coloured armoured vehicles flying the American flag pulled up at the headquarters of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces outside the city of Qamishli.</p>
      <p>They also passed by the People's Protection Units (YPG) who have spearheaded the SDF, and Kurdish security forces in the area.</p>
      <p>Two days earlier, a similar US convoy was seen further east along the border, outside the town of Qahtaniyah, in an area they used to operate in before Washington announced a military pullout last month.</p>
      <p>A US-led coalition has for years backed the SDF in fighting the Islamic State group, but the announcement of an American withdrawal triggered a deadly Turkish invasion against the Kurds on October 9.</p>
      <p>A source who took part in one of the Kurdish-US meetings on Saturday said the Americans wanted to return to Qamishli.</p>
      <p>"They're coming to set up a major military post in Qamishli," the source told AFP.</p>
      <p>The coalition declined to comment specifically on Saturday's visit, but said the alliance continued to withdraw forces from northern Syria.</p>
      <p>It would relocate some troops to oil-rich eastern Syria to held stamp out remaining IS fighters.</p>
      <p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor, says Washington also still has forces in a base near Rmeilan, a town further east along the border.</p>
      <p>Under a ceasefire deal signed last week, joint Turkish-Russian patrols started on Friday in the area.</p>
      <p>Syrian regime forces have also made a major comeback in the northeast for the first time in years, after they were called in by the Kurds to fill the void left by US troops.</p>
      <p>Syria's war has spiralled into a complex conflict involving word powers since it started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.</p>
