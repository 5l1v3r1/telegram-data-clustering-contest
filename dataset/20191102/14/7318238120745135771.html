      <p>US President Donald Trump says he could sign a long-awaited trade agreement with China.</p>
      <p>He has floated the idea of signing it in Iowa, a farming state that has been hard hit by a 16-month trade war with Beijing.</p>
      <p>The state is also crucial to his re-election bid in 2020.</p>
      <p>The trade dispute has slashed exports of US soybeans and other crops.</p>
      <p>Trump and China's President Xi Jinping had been due to sign a deal at an APEC meeting in Chile later this month but the host nation has now cancelled it.</p>
      <p>"We're moving along with a deal with China. China wants to make the deal very much. And we have a good relationship," Trump said on Friday.</p>
      <p>The trade war began when Trump slapped tariffs on Chinese goods, alleging that Beijing promoted unfair trading practices.</p>
      <p>Another round of tariffs is due in December which would hit big spending items for consumers laptops and mobile phones.</p>
      <p>Almost all consumers goods in the US are now affected including food, clothes and shoes.</p>
