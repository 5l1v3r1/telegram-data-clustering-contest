      <p>Former Rangers captain <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lee-wallace">Lee Wallace</a> makes his first start in over two years as he finally makes his Queens Park Rangers debut.</p>
      <p>The left-back struggled with injuries during the latter days of his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> career, and also spent time away from the squad after disciplinary proceedings were opened against him and Kenny Miller.</p>
      <p>Wallace made three appearances for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> 's side last season, all of which came from the bench, before leaving on a free transfer.</p>
      <p>He then signed for former manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/mark-warburton">Mark Warburton</a> at Loftus Road, but hasn't made a single appearance for QPR so far.</p>
      <p>Wallace is in the starting XI for today's match against Leeds United at Elland Road though, his first start in over two years.</p>

      <p>The former Scotland international was named in the Rangers starting XI for a match against Partick Thistle on September 15 2017, but was forced off with injury after 12 minutes.</p>
      <p>That was his last start in a competitive game, and his last 90 minutes came in a 4-1 win over Dundee on September 9 two years ago.</p>
      <p>Wallace made 256 appearances for Rangers, playing at every level of the SPFL and scoring 25 goals.</p>
