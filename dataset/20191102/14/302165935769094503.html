      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 2 — The Malaysian E-Vaporisers and Tobacco Alternative Association (Mevta) has called on the government to allow the sale of nicotine vape, but with regulations as being implemented in the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>Its president, Rizani Zakaria said the seizures of vape products worth millions of ringgit nationwide,  by the Health Ministry recently, is affecting the business of vape industry players.</p>
      <p>“We are aware of the enforcement action taken by the ministry and want  the vape traders to cooperate with the authorities.</p>
      <p>“Our request is for the government to allow the sale of nicotine vape with regulations as imposed in the United Kingdom,” he said in a statement here today.</p>
      <p>He said the industry players also suggested that the special committee on vape control, which is chaired by Deputy Health Minister Dr Lee Boon Chye, also include Mevta as a representative from the industry to discuss together the regulations.</p>
      <p>The vape industry in Malaysia is currently run by local youth entrepreneurs and almost 95 per cent of them are Bumiputeras, he added.</p>
      <p>Based on local media reports yesterday, the Health Ministry seized 35,439 products, believed to contain nicotine involving RM6.38 million worth of seizures, in an integrated operation nationwide. — Bernama</p>
